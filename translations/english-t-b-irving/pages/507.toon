quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,God will let the actions of those who disbelieve and obstruct His way miss their mark
  47,2,"while He will cancel out the evil deeds and improve the attitude of those who believe, perform honorable deeds and believe in what has been sent down to Muhammad - for it is the Truth from their Lord"
  47,3,That is because the ones who disbelieve follow falsehood while those who believe follow the Truth from their Lord. Thus God makes up their comparisons for mankind
  47,4,"Whenever you encounter the ones who disbelieve [during war], seize them by their necks until once you have subdued them, then tie them up as prisoners, either in order to release them later on or also to ask for ransom, until war lays down her burdens. Thus shall you do-; yet if God so wished, He might defend Himself from them-in order that some of you may be tested by means of one another. The ones who have been killed in God´s way will never find their actions have been in vain"
  47,5,He will guide them and improve their attitude
  47,6,and admit them to the Garden He has acquainted them with
  47,7,"You who believe, if you support God, He will support you and steady your footsteps"
  47,8,while the ones who disbelieve will feel wretched and their actions will miss the mark
  47,9,That is because they have hated anything God has sent down and so their actions have miscarried
  47,10,"Have they not travelled around the earth and seen what the outcome was for those who came before them? God annihilated them, while disbelievers will have the same as they did"
  47,11,"That is because God is the Protector of those who believe, while disbelievers have no protector"
