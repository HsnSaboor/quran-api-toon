quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,89,"Whenever a Book has come to them from God to confirm what they already have-whereas previously they had been seeking victory over those who disbelieve-so whenever something they can recognize is brought to them, they disbelieve go in it. God´s curse lies on disbelievers"
  2,90,"How wretchedly have they sold their own souls by disbelieving in what God has sent down to them, begrudging that God should send down some of His bounty on any of His servants He may wish. They have brought an exchange of anger for anger on themselves; disbelievers will have shameful torment"
  2,91,"Whenever someone tells them: \"Believe in what God has sent down;\" they say: \"We believe [only] in what has been sent down to us,\" while they disbelieve in what has come after that, even though it is the Truth confirming what they already have. SAY: \"Why did you kill God´s prophets previously if you were believers"
  2,92,Moses came to you with evidence; then later on you adopted the Calf and became wrongdoers
  2,93,"When We made an agreement with you and raised the Mountain up over you [as a symbol]: \"Take whatever We have brought you seriously, and listen;\" they said: \"We listen and [yet] we disobey!\" They sucked the [spirit of the] Calf into their hearts because of their disbelief. SAY: \"How wretchedly your faith commands you, if you ever have been believers"
