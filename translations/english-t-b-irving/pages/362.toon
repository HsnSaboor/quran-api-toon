quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,21,"Those who do not expect to meet Us say: \"Why aren´t angels sent down to us, or we are allowed to see our Lord?\" They act too proud of themselves, and strut around quite insolently"
  25,22,"Some day they shall see the angels! There will be news for criminals on that day and they will say: \"Oh, for a stonewall built to protect [us]"
  25,23,We shall advance upon whatever action they have performed and turn it into scattered dust
  25,24,The inhabitants of the Garden will have the best residence and finest lodging on that day
  25,25,"on a day when the sky will split open along with its clouds, and the angels will be sent right on down"
  25,26,True control will belong to the Mercy-giving on that day. It will be a harsh day for disbelievers
  25,27,a day when the wrongdoer will gnaw away at his hands
  25,28,"He will say: \"It´s too bad for me! If I had only taken a pathway alongside the Messenger! It´s too bad for me! If I had not adopted So-and-So as a close friend"
  25,29,He led me astray from the Reminder even after it had reached me. Satan is such a turncoat with man
  25,30,"The Messenger will say: \"My Lord, my folk assume this Reading is out-of-date"
  25,31,Thus have We granted every prophet an enemy among criminals. Yet your Lord suffices as a Guide and Supporter
  25,32,"Those who disbelieve say: \"Why has not the Quran been sent down to him in one single piece?\" [It has been done] like that so your vitals may be braced by it; We have phrased it deliberately"
