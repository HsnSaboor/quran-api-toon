quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"Whenever they are told: \"Come, God´s messenger will seek forgiveness for you,\" they twist their heads around and you will see them trying to slip away, while they act so haughty"
  63,6,It is the same for them whether you seek forgiveness for them or do not seek forgiveness for them; God will never forgive them! God does not guide such immoral folk
  63,7,"They are the ones who say: \"Do not spend anything on anyone who is with God´s messenger until they desert [him].\" God holds the treasures of Heaven and Earth, yet hypocrites do not comprehend this"
  63,8,"They say: \"If we should ever return to the City, the grandees there would expel the lower [classes].\" Yet influence belongs to God, His messenger and believers, even though hypocrites do not realize it"
  63,9,"You who believe, let neither your wealth nor your children distract you from remembering God. Those who do so will be the losers"
  63,10,"Spend something from whatever We have provided you with before death comes to one of you and he says: \"My Lord, if You would only delay things for me for a short while, then I will act charitably and become honorable"
  63,11,God will never postpone things for any soul once its deadline has arrived. God is Informed about anything you do
