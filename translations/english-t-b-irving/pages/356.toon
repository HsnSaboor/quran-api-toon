quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,44,God alternates night and daylight; in that there lies a lesson for those possessing insight
  24,45,"God has created every animal out of water; some of them walk on their belly, while others walk on two legs and still others walk on four. God creates anything He wishes; God is Able [to do) everything"
  24,46,"We have sent clarifying signs down, and God guides anyone He wishes to a Straight Road"
  24,47,"They will say: \"We believe in God and the Messenger, and we obey.\" Then a group of them will turn away even after that; those are not believers"
  24,48,"Whenever they are invited to [come to] God and His messenger so He may judge among them, watch how a group of them will shunt it aside"
  24,49,"Yet if they have the Truth on their side, they come to it voluntarily"
  24,50,"Does some malice lurk in their hearts? Either they act skeptical, or else they fear that God and His messenger will cheat them. In fact such persons are wrongdoers"
  24,51,"The only statement believers should make when they are invited to [meet with] God and His messenger, so He may judge among them, is: \"We have heard, and are at your orders!´ Those persons will be successful"
  24,52,"Those who obey God and His messenger, and dread God and heed Him, will be triumphant"
  24,53,"They swear before God with their most solemn oaths that they would go forth if you ordered them to. SAY: Do not swear so; obedience will be recognized, God is Informed about anything you do"
