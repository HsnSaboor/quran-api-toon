quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,22,"As he made his way towards Midian, he said: \"Perhaps my Lord will guide me along some level path"
  28,23,"When he approached the water of Midian, he found a company of people watering [their flocks] there, and found two women besides them, holding theirs off at a distance. He said: \"What´s the matter with you?\" They both said: \"We may not draw any water until the herdsmen move on. Our father is an elderly gentleman"
  28,24,"So he did the watering for them. Then he went off to [rest in] the shade, and said: \"My Lord, I am poor enough to accept anything You may grant me"
  28,25,"One of the girls came up to him, walking bashfully. She said: \"My father invites you, in order to reward you with some [sort of] payment since you have done the watering for us.\" When he came up to him, he told him the stories. He said: \"Do not fear; you have escaped from wrongdoing folk"
  28,26,"One of the two (girls) said: \"My father, hire him! The best man you can hire is someone who is strong, trustworthy"
  28,27,"He said: \"I want to marry you to one of these daughters of mine, provided you hire yourself out to me for eight seasons. If you should complete ten, then that will be your own affair. I do not want to be hard on you; you will find me an honorable man, if God so wishes"
  28,28,"He said: \"That is up to you and me; whichever term I may serve out, there will be no injustice done to me. God is a Trustee for anything we say"
