quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  66,1,"O Prophet, why do you prohibit something that God has permitted you? You seek to please your wives while God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  66,2,"God has stipulated that you (all) should disregard such oaths of yours. God is your Patron; He is the Aware, the Wise"
  66,3,"Thus the Prophet confided a story to one of his wives and when she spread it around, God disclosed the matter to him. He let some of it be known, and overlooked part [of it]. However when he informed her about it, she said: \"Who told you about this?\", he said: \"The Aware, the Informed One told me so"
  66,4,"If both of you will turn to God (in repentance), then let your hearts be so inclined; while if you back each other up against him, then God will be his Patron as well as Gabriel, plus any honorable believer. The angels furthermore are [his] backers"
  66,5,"Perhaps, should he divorce you, his Lord would grant him even better wives than you are in exchange, ones committed to (live in) peace, who are believers, devoted, repentant, worshipful, serving as social workers, both matrons and virgins"
  66,6,"You who believe, shield yourselves and your families from a fire whose fuel will be men and stones: over it there [lurk] fierce, stem angels who do not disobey God in anything He commands them [to do]. They do whatever they are ordered to"
  66,7,"You who disbelieve, do not make up any excuses today; you are merely being rewarded for whatever you have been doing"
