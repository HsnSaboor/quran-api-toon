quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  25,3,"Instead of Him, they have taken on (other) gods which do not create anything while they themselves have been created. They control no harm nor do they control death nor life, nor even rebirth"
  25,4,"Those who disbelieve say: \"This is only some swindle he has invented; other folk have helped him at it.\" They have trumped up something wrong and counterfeit"
  25,5,"They say: \"He has had legends by primitive men written down; they are dictated to him in the early morning and evening"
  25,6,"SAY: \"The One Who knows the secrets of Heaven and Earth has sent it down. He is Forgiving, Merciful"
  25,7,"Yet they say: \"What sort of messenger is this? He eats food and walks through the markets! If only some angel were sent down to him, to act as a warner alongside him"
  25,8,"Or a treasure were offered him, or a garden belonged to him from which he might eat.\" Wrongdoers say: \"You are only following a man who is bewitched"
  25,9,Watch what sort of stories they make up about you; they are lost and cannot find any way back
  25,10,"Blessed is the One Who may grant you something even better than that if He so wishes: gardens through which rivers flow. He may even grant you palaces"
  25,11,Yet they even deny the Hour. We have prepared a Blaze for anyone who denies the Hour
