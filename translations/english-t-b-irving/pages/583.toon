quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,The heedful will have their scene of triumph
  78,32,with parks and vineyards
  78,33,as well as buxom maidens their own age
  78,34,and a brimming The cup
  78,35,"They will hear no idle talk nor any lying [gossip] there"
  78,36,"as a compensation from your Lord, a calculated gift"
  78,37,"Lord of Heaven and Earth as well as whatever is in between them, [He is] the Mercy-giving! They control no means of addressing Him"
  78,38,"on the day when the Spirit and the angels will stand there in ranks, only someone the Mercy-giving grants permission to shall speak, and he will speak straight to the point"
  78,39,"That day will seem too real! Anyone who wishes to, may adopt his recourse to [reach] the Lord"
  78,40,"We have warned you (all) how punishment lies close-at-hand, on a day when any man will see whatever his own hands have sent on ahead, and the disbeliever will say: \"If I were only dust"
  79,1,"By those who snatch [men´s souls] away at their last gasp"
  79,2,and others who act more nimbly
  79,3,as well as those floating by
  79,4,and still others racing past
  79,5,to regulate some matter
  79,6,Someday a rumbling will be felt
  79,7,another will follow on its heels
  79,8,Hearts will be pounding on that day
  79,9,their sight will be downcast
  79,10,"They will say: \"Will we be restored to our original state"
  79,11,once we are crumbled bones
  79,12,"They say: ´That would then be a losing proposition"
  79,13,There would only be a single rebuke
  79,14,and then they would never be able to sleep again
  79,15,Has Moses´ story ever come to you
