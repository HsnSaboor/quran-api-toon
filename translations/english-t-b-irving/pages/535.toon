quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,Immortal youths will stroll around them
  56,18,"with glasses, pitchers, and a cup from a fountain"
  56,19,which will not upset them nor dull their senses
  56,20,and any fruit that they may choose
  56,21,and the meat from any fowl they may desire
  56,22,"and bright-eyed damsels [chaste] just like treasured pearls"
  56,23,as a reward for what they have been doing
  56,24,They will not hear any idle talk there nor any fault-finding
  56,25,"merely people saying: \"Peace! Peace"
  56,26,The Companions on the Right
  56,27,what about the Companions on the Right
  56,28,"[They will be] among hawthoms trimmed of their thorns"
  56,29,and bananas piled bunch on bunch
  56,30,with their shade spread out
  56,31,water pouring forth
  56,32,and plenty of fruit
  56,33,which is neither rationed nor forbidden
  56,34,"and padded furniture raised [off the floor]"
  56,35,We have produced special women
  56,36,and made them (ever) virgins
  56,37,easy to get along with and of their same age
  56,38,for the Companions on the Right
  56,39,a multitude from early men
  56,40,as well as a multitude from later ones
  56,41,"The Companions on the Unlucky side, what about the Companions on the Left"
  56,42,"In a scorching wind, scalding water"
  56,43,and the shade of pitch-black smoke
  56,44,which is neither cool nor refreshing
  56,45,They had been luxuriating before that happened
  56,46,and persisted in awesome blasphemy
  56,47,"and kept on saying: ´When we have died and become dust and bones, will we be raised up again"
  56,48,Along with our earliest forefathers
  56,49,"SAY: \"The earlier and the later ones"
  56,50,will be gathered together for an appointment on a well-known day
