quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,What are they questioning one another about
  78,2,About an important announcement
  78,3,which they are disagreeing over
  78,4,However they soon will know
  78,5,Then indeed they shall know
  78,6,Have We not laid the earth out as a cradle
  78,7,"and [set] the mountains up as kingpins"
  78,8,We have created you in pairs
  78,9,and granted your sleeping for repose
  78,10,and granted night as a garment
  78,11,"and granted daytime for [you to earn your] living in"
  78,12,We have built seven firmaments above you
  78,13,and set a blazing lamp there
  78,14,We send down water in torrents wrung from rainclouds
  78,15,so We may produce grain and plants with it
  78,16,as well as luxuriant gardens
  78,17,The day for Sorting has been appointed
  78,18,the day when the Trumpet shall be blown so you will come in droves
  78,19,and the sky will open up as if it had gates
  78,20,and the mountains will travel along as if they were a mirage
  78,21,Hell will lurk in ambush
  78,22,to receive home the arrogant
  78,23,who will linger there for ages
  78,24,They will taste nothing cool in it nor any drink
  78,25,except hot bathwater and slops
  78,26,"[which are such] a fitting compensation"
  78,27,"since they have never expected [to meet with] any reckoning"
  78,28,and have wittingly rejected Our signs
  78,29,Everything have We calculated in writing
  78,30,So taste! Yet We shall only increase torment for you
