quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  3,154,"Then following [your] worry, He sent down confidence upon you; a drowsiness overcame one squadron of yours, while another squadron fretted themselves thinking something besides the Truth about God, guesswork from [the times of] Ignorance. They said: \"Is this a concern of ours in any way?\" SAY: \"The whole concern is up to God.\" They hide something they do not show in their souls; they say: \"If we had had anything to do with the matter, we would not have had to fight here.\" SAY: \"Even though you were in your own homes, those for whom killing has been prescribed would have shown up on their deathbeds, so that God might test what is on your minds and purge whatever is in your hearts. God is Aware of whatever is on your minds"
  3,155,"Those of you who turned away on the day when both troops met, were only tripped up by Satan because of something they had earned. However God has pardoned them, for God is Forgiving, Lenient"
  3,156,"You who believe, do not be like those who disbelieve and tell their brethren when they travel around the earth or are out on some campaign: \"If they had been with us, they would not have died nor been killed,\" so that God places that [sort of] despair in their hearts. God gives life and brings death; God is Observant of anything you do"
  3,157,"If you should be killed for God´s sake or die, forgiveness and mercy from God are better than what they are gathering"
