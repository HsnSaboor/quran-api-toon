quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,Another for them is how We transported their offspring on the laden ship
  36,42,We have created something like it for them on which they must sail
  36,43,"If We wished, We might even let them drown and they would have no one to cry out to, nor would they be rescued"
  36,44,except as a mercy from Us and to enjoy things for a while
  36,45,"When they are told: \"Heed what lies in front of you and what´s behind you so that you may find mercy"
  36,46,not one of their Lord´s signs has come to them except they tried to avoid it
  36,47,"When they are (also) told: \"Spend something God has provided you with,\" the ones who disbelieve tell those who believe: \"Should we feed someone whom God would feed if He so wishes? You are quite obviously in error"
  36,48,"They say: \"When will this promise occur if you are so truthful"
  36,49,They need only wait for a single Blast to catch them while they are arguing away
  36,50,"They will not even manage to draw up a will, nor will they return to their own people"
  36,51,The Trumpet will be blow and then they will swarm forth from their tombs to meet their Lord
  36,52,"They will say: \"It´s too bad for us! Whoever has raised us up from our sleeping quarters? This is what the Mercy-giving promised; the emissaries have been telling the truth"
  36,53,There will be only a single Blast and then they will all be assembled in Our presence
  36,54,"On that day no soul will be harmed in any way, and you will be rewarded only for what you have been doing"
