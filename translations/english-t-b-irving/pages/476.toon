quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,78,"We have sent messengers before you, some of whom We have told you about, while We have not told you about others. No messenger may bring any sign unless it is with God´s permission. Once God´s command comes, [matters] will be decided correctly, and that is where the quibblers will lose out"
  40,79,God is the One Who has granted you livestock so you may ride on some and eat from others
  40,80,"You receive benefits from them so that by means of them, you may satisfy any need you have in mind; on them and on shipboard are you transported"
  40,81,"He shows you His signs, so which of God´s signs will you disregard"
  40,82,"Have you not travelled around the earth and observed what the outcome has been for those who preceded them? They were more numerous and stronger than they are, and they [left greater] remains on earth. Yet whatever they had accomplished did not help them out"
  40,83,"when their messengers brought them explanations, they were happy with the knowledge they already possessed; so what they had been making fun of swept in around them"
  40,84,"However once they saw Our might, they said: \"We believe in God Alone, and disbelieve in what we used to associate with Him"
  40,85,"Their [sudden] faith did not benefit them once they saw Our might; [such is] God´s practice which He has already used with His servants. The disbelievers lost out right there"
