quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,53,"Even so do We try some of them by means of others, so they may say: \"Are those the ones among us towards whom God has been gracious? Is God not quite Aware as to who are grateful"
  6,54,"Whenever those who believe in Our signs come to you, SAY: \"Peace be upon you!\" Your Lord has prescribed mercy for Himself so He will be Forgiving, Merciful to any of you who commits evil out of ignorance, then repents later on and reforms"
  6,55,Thus We spell out signs so the criminals´ way may be evident
  6,56,"SAY: \"I am forbidden to serve those whom you appeal to instead of to God.\" SAY: \"I do not follow your whims: in that case I would go astray and not be guided"
  6,57,"SAY: \"I am [looking] for evidence from my Lord while you have rejected it. I do not have what you are trying to hurry up; discretion lies only with God. He relates the Truth and is the best Decider"
  6,58,"SAY: \"If I had what you seek to hurry up, the matter would have been settled between me and you. God is quite Aware as to who a wrongdoers"
  6,59,"He holds the keys to the Unseen; only He knows them! He knows whatever exists on land and at sea; no leaf drops down unless He knows it, nor any seed [lies] in the darkness of the earth, nor any tender [shoot] nor any withered [stalk] unless it is [written down] in a clear Book"
