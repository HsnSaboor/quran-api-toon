quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,90,Rather We have brought them the Truth while they deny it
  23,91,"God has not adopted any son, nor is there any [other] deity alongside Him, otherwise each god would carry off whatever it has created, and some of them would gain the upper hand over others. Glory be to God beyond what they describe"
  23,92,"Knower of the Unseen and the Visible: Exalted is He over anything they may associate [with Him]"
  23,93,"SAY: \"My Lord, will you show me what they are threatened with"
  23,94,"My Lord, do not place me among such wrongdoing folk"
  23,95,We are Able indeed to show you whatever We are threatening them with
  23,96,Repay evil with something that is finer; We are quite Aware of anything they describe
  23,97,"SAY: \"My Lord, I seek refuge with You from the devils promptings"
  23,98,"I seek refuge with you, my Lord, lest they accompany me"
  23,99,"since whenever death comes to any one of them, he says: \"My Lord, send me back"
  23,100,"so I may act honorably with anything I may have left behind\"´ Indeed not! It is merely a remark he is making. Beyond them there lies a barrier till the day when they will be raised up again"
  23,101,"Once the Trumpet is blown, no ties of kinship will exist between them on that day, nor may they question one another"
  23,102,Those whose scales are heavy will be prosperous
  23,103,while those whose scales are light will be the ones who have lost their souls; they will remain in Hell
  23,104,The fire will scorch their faces while they will glower away in it
