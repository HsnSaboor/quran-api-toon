quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,"Anyone whose breast God has opened up to Islam will [receive] light from his Lord. It will be awful for those whose hearts have been hardened against remembering God! Such people are in obvious error"
  39,23,"God has sent down the finest report in a consistently duplicated Book. The skins of those who dread their Lord tingle with it; then their skins and hearts are softened up for remembering God. Such is God´s guidance; He guides anyone He wishes by means of it, while anyone whom God lets go astray will have no one to guide him"
  39,24,"Who is it who wards off the worst torment from his person on Resurrection Day? Wrongdoers will be told: \"Taste what you have been earning"
  39,25,"The ones who preceded them denied it, so torment came at them from somewhere they did not notice"
  39,26,God lets them taste disgrace during worldly life while torment in the Hereafter will be even greater if they only realized it
  39,27,We have made up every sort of comparison for mankind in this Reading so that they may be reminded by
  39,28,an Arabic Quran possessing no ambiguity so that they may do their duty
  39,29,"God has compared one man who has quarrelsome partners with another man dealing peacefully with [still another] man. Are either of them comparable? Praise be to God! Yet most of them do not realize it"
  39,30,"You are mortal and they are mortal [too]"
  39,31,Still on Resurrection Day you (all) will argue it out before your Lord
