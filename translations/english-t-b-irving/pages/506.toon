quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  46,29,"Once We detailed a platoon of sprites for you so they might listen to the Quran. When they were present at it, they said: \"Hush!\" When it was finished, they went back to their folk as warners"
  46,30,"They said: \"Our people, we have just heard a Book sent down after Moses to confirm what came before it. It guides one to Truth and to a Straight Road"
  46,31,"Our people, answer God´s herald and believe in him! He will forgive you some of your offences and protect you from painful torment"
  46,32,"Anyone who does not answer God´s herald will never escape on earth, nor will he have any patrons besides Him, Such people are in obvious error"
  46,33,"Have they not considered that God, Who created Heaven and Earth, has not been worn out through creating them since [He is] Able to revive even the dead? Indeed He is Capable of everything"
  46,34,"Some day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire [and asked]: \"Is this not real?\"; they will say: \"Indeed, by our Lord!\" He will say: \"Well, taste torment since you were disbelieving"
  46,35,"Be patient just as those messengers who were steadfast were patient. Do not try to hurry [things] up for them, since they will seem to have lingered for only an hour of daylight on the day when they shall see what they have been promised! [It is] a decree! Yet will only immoral folk be wiped out"
