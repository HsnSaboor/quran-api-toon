quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  9,37,"Postponing it will only [lead to] an increase in [their] disbelief. those who disbelieve are led astray by it; they permit it one year and ban it another year so they make up for any number that God has forbidden and (even) permit something God has forbidden. Their evil actions seem attractive to them, although God does not guide disbelieving folk"
  9,38,"You who believe, what is wrong with you when you are told: ´March off in God´s cause!\"? Do you feel weighted down to the ground? Are you more satisfied with worldly life than with the [prospect of the] Hereafter? The comfort of worldly life will mean so little in the Hereafter"
  9,39,"Unless you march away, He will punish you with painful torment and substitute you with some other folk. You will not harm Him in any way, for God is Capable of everything"
  9,40,"If you do not support him, well God did support him when those who disbelieved expelled him as the second of two, when they were both in the Cave, as he told his companion: \"Do not worry; for God is with us.\" So God sent His serenity down on him and aided him with troops you did not see, and placed the word of those who disbelieved lowest, while God´s word remained supreme. God is Powerful, Wise"
