quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,138,"They say: \"This livestock and (these) crops are taboo; only someone we wish to may eat them!\", according to their claim. There are some livestock whose backs one is forbidden to ride, as well as (other) livestock over which God´s name has not been mentioned, as something invented despite Him. He will reward them according to what they have been inventing"
  6,139,"They say: \"What is in this livestock´s bellies is reserved exclusively for our menfolk, and forbidden to our wives.\" Yet if it is stillborn, then they may be partners in it! He will reward them for their description; He is Wise, Aware"
  6,140,"Those who have stupidly killed their own children without having any knowledge and forbidden something God has provided them with, have lost out through inventing things about God; they have gone astray and not accepted guidance"
  6,141,"He it is Who has produced gardens, both trellised and untrellised, and datepalms and field crops whose food [tastes] different, as well as olives and pomegranates which are so alike and yet so unlike! Eat some of their fruit as they ripen, and give away whatever they ought to on their harvest day. Yet do not overdo things for He does not love extravagant people"
  6,142,"Some livestock is for transport and some meant for use at home. Eat anything God has provided you with and do not follow in Satan´s footsteps, for he is an open enemy of yours"
