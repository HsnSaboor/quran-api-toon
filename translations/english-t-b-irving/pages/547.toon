quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  59,10,"The ones who came after them say: Our Lord, forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith, and do not place any rancor in our hearts concerning those who believe. Our Lord, You are Compassionate, Merciful"
  59,11,"Have you not considered those who act hypocritically? They tell their brethren among the People of the Book who disbelieve: \"If you are expelled, we will leave along with you. We shall never obey anyone concerning you. If you are attacked, we will support you.\" God will show them up as liars"
  59,12,"If they ever are expelled, they will not leave with them, while if they are attacked, they will never support them. Even if they should support them, they will still turn their backs [on them]; then they will not be supported"
  59,13,"They are more in dread of you (all) than anything they feel in their breasts towards God. That is because they are a folk who do not comprehend [anything]"
  59,14,"They will not fight you as a group except from inside fortified towns or from behind walls. Their violence towards one another is serious; you would reckon they would stick together, while their hearts are so at odds. That is because they are a folk who do not use their reason"
  59,15,"Just as the ones shortly before them tasted the consequence of their own action, even so they will have painful torment"
  59,16,"It is just as Satan does when he tells a man: \"Disbelieve,\" and then once he does disbelieve, says: \"I am innocent of you; I fear God, Lord of the Universe"
