quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,78,"He said: \"I have been given it only because of some knowledge I possess.\" Did he not realize that God had wiped out generations before him who were stronger than he and possessed even greater resources? Will not criminals be questioned concerning their offences"
  28,79,"He went forth to his folk [dressed] in his finery. Those who wanted worldly life said: \"If we only had the same as Quran has been given! He has been extremely lucky"
  28,80,"However those who had been given knowledge said: \"It will be too bad for you! God´s recompense is better for anyone who believes and acts honorably. Yet only the patient will encounter it"
  28,81,Then We let the earth swallow up him and his home. He did not have any party to support him against God; he was not supported
  28,82,"Those who longed to be in his place the day before, said the next morning: \"Since it is God Who extends sustenance to anyone He wishes from among His servants and measures it out, it would have swallowed us up too if God had not cared for us. It seems that disbelievers do not prosper"
  28,83,That home in the Hereafter will We grant to those who want neither haughtiness nor any corruption on earth. The outcome belongs to those who do their duty
  28,84,"Anyone who brings a fine deed will have something even better than it, while anyone who comes with an evil deed [will find that] those who perform evil deeds will not be rewarded except for whatever they have been doing"
