quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and turned away
  80,2,because the blind man came to him
  80,3,"What will make you realize that he may [yet] be purified (of disbelief)"
  80,4,"or even reminded, and the Reminder may benefit him"
  80,5,However anyone who seems indifferent
  80,6,you will attend to
  80,7,It is not your concern whether he will purify himself (or not)
  80,8,Yet with someone who comes to you eagerly
  80,9,and anxiously
  80,10,you act so distracted
  80,11,"Indeed, it serves as a Reminder"
  80,12,Anyone who wishes should remember how it
  80,13,"[exists] on honored pages"
  80,14,"which are held aloft [for display], cleansed"
  80,15,"by the hands of noble, virtuous scribes"
  80,16,"noble, virtuous"
  80,17,Let man be damned! What makes him act ungrateful
  80,18,From what sort of thing did He create him
  80,19,From a drop of semen has He created him and proportioned him
  80,20,Then He made the Way easy for him
  80,21,next He will let him die and bury him
  80,22,"Then [later on] He will raise him up again whenever He may wish"
  80,23,Of course he does not accomplish what He orders him to
  80,24,So let man look at his own food
  80,25,We let water pour down abundantly
  80,26,then We split the earth right open
  80,27,and cause grain to sprout from it
  80,28,and grapes and fodder
  80,29,"olive trees, datepalms"
  80,30,and dense woodlots
  80,31,"and fruit[-trees) and pastures"
  80,32,as an enjoyment for both you and your livestock
  80,33,When the uproar comes
  80,34,on a day when man will flee from his brother
  80,35,his mother and his father
  80,36,his mate and his children
  80,37,every last man among them will have enough concern that day to keep him occupied
  80,38,Some faces will be beaming on that day
  80,39,"laughing, rejoicing"
  80,40,while other faces will be covered with grime on that day
  80,41,soot will overshadow them
  80,42,Those will be the shameless disbelievers
