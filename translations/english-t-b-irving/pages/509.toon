quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"Those who believe say: ´If a chapter were only sent down!\"; yet whenever some decisive chapter is sent down and fighting is mentioned in it, you will see the ones whose hearts contain malice looking at you as if they were going to faint from [fear of] death. It would be more fitting for them"
  47,21,"to [offer their] obedience and use decent speech; when some matter is resolved, it would be better for them if they acted sincerely towards God"
  47,22,"Would you by any chance, if you assumed power, cause havoc on earth and fight with your own flesh and blood"
  47,23,Those are the ones whom God has cursed; He has made them deaf and blinded their eyesight
  47,24,"Will they not meditate on the Quran, or do they have locks on their hearts"
  47,25,"Satan has seduced the ones who turned their backs after guidance had been explained to them, and he is dictating to them"
  47,26,"That is because they tell the ones who hate what God has sent down: \"We will obey you (only) in part of what you order.\" Yet God knows their secrets"
  47,27,"How will it be when the angels gather them up, beating them on their faces and their backs"
  47,28,"That is because they have followed something that exasperates God and they hate to please Him, so He lets their actions miscarry"
  47,29,Or do those whose hearts contain malice reckon that God will never expose their grudges
