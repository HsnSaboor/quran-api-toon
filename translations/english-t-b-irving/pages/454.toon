quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,17,"Endure what they are saying and remember how Our servant David commanded assistance; he was attentive [to God]"
  38,18,"We forced the mountains to glorify [God] with him at evening and sunrise"
  38,19,"and the birds were summoned and each was [made] attentive to him"
  38,20,We strengthened his control and gave him wisdom and distinction as an orator
  38,21,"Has news of the litigants ever reached you, when they climbed over the wall into the sanctuary"
  38,22,"Thus they burst in upon David so he was startled by them. They said: \"Don´t be afraid: [we are] two litigants, one of whom has injured the other; so judge correctly between us and do not act too stern. Guide us along the Level Road"
  38,23,"This is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes while I have but a single ewe. He has said: \"Turn her over to me,\" and has spoken harshly to me"
  38,24,"He said: \"He has wronged you by asking for your ewe [to be added] to his own ewes. Many partners try to take advantage of one another, except for those who believe and perform honorable deeds. Such are few indeed.\" David suspected that We were merely testing him, so he sought forgiveness from his Lord and dropped down on his knees [in worship], and repented"
  38,25,So We forgave him that. He enjoys precedence with Us and the finest retreat
  38,26,"David, We have placed you as an overlord on earth, so judge among men correctly and do not follow any whims which will lead you away from God´s path. Those who stray from God´s path will have severe torment because they have forgotten the Day of Reckoning"
