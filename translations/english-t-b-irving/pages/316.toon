quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  20,65,"They said: \"Moses, either you will cast [something] or shall we be the first to cast [a spell]"
  20,66,"He said: \"Rather you throw [first].\" You should have seen their ropes and rods! It appeared to him as if they were moving around because of their magic"
  20,67,so Moses conceived a fear within himself
  20,68,"We said: \"Do not act afraid: you will come out on top"
  20,69,"Throw down what is in your right hand so it will swallow up anything they have produced. What they have produced is only some magician´s trick, and no magician succeeds no matter where he goes"
  20,70,"So the magicians threw themselves down on their knees. They said: \"We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses"
  20,71,"He said: \"Have you believed in Him before I permit you to? He must be your chief who has taught you magic! I´ll cut your hands and feet off on opposite sides, and have you crucified on the trunks of datepalms, so you may know which of us is harsher with torment and going to last longer"
  20,72,"They said: \"We will never choose you before explanations have come to us nor ahead of the One Who originated us. Decide anything you may decide; you are no judge: You will only decide during this worldly life"
  20,73,"We believe in our Lord, so He may forgive us our mistakes as well as for any magic you have compelled us to perform. God is Better and more Enduring"
  20,74,"Anyone who comes to his Lord as a criminal will have HELL [as his reward]; he will neither die in it, nor yet will he live [a decent life]"
  20,75,Whoever comes to Him as a believer has performed honorable deeds; those will have the highest ranks
  20,76,"the gardens of Eden through which rivers flow, to live in forever. That will be the reward for anyone who becomes purified"
