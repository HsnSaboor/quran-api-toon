quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,152,"Do not approach an orphan´s estate before he comes of age, except to improve it. Grant full measure and weight in all fairness. We do not assign person to do more than he can cope with. Whenever you speak, be just even though it concerns a close relative. Fulfill God´s agreement. Thus has He instructed you so that you may bear it in mind"
  6,153,"This is My Straight Road, so follow it and do not follow [other] paths which will separate you from His path. Thus has He instructed you so that you may do your duty"
  6,154,"Then We gave Moses the Book as a fulfillment for someone who acts kindly, and an analysis of everything, as well as for guidance and mercy so they may believe about meeting their Lord. (XX)"
  6,155,"This is a Blessed Book We have sent down, so follow it and do your duty so that you may receive mercy"
  6,156,"lest you say: \"The Book was sent down to only two factions before us. We have been unaware of what they study"
  6,157,"Or you may say: \"If the Book had been sent down to us, We would be better guided than they are.\" Evidence has now come to you from your Lord, as well as guidance and mercy. Who is more in the wrong than someone who rejects God´s signs and even evades them? We will reward those who evade Our signs with the worst torment because they have acted so evasive"
