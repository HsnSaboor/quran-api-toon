quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,62,"They swear by God for you just to please you (all). It is more correct to please God and His messenger if they are [really] believers"
  9,63,Do they not know that anyone who places any limits on God and His messenger will have Hell fire to remain in forever? That will be an awful disgrace
  9,64,"Hypocrites act anxious lest a chapter be sent down for them to notify them as to what is in their hearts. SAY: ´Joke away: God will produce what you are so anxious about"
  9,65,"If you question them, they say: ´We have only been toying (with words) and playing around.\" SAY: \"Have you been joking about God, and His signs and His messengers"
  9,66,"Make no excuses! You have disbelieved following your profession of faith. If We should pardon one faction of you, we will punish another faction since they have been such criminals"
  9,67,"Hypocrites, whether men or women, resemble one another: they command wickedness, forbid decency, and clench their fists. They have forgotten God, so He has forgotten them. Hypocrites are so immoral"
  9,68,"God has promised hypocrites, whether they are men or women, as well as [outright] disbelievers, Hell fire to live in forever: it will be their reckoning. God has cursed them, and they will have constant torment"
