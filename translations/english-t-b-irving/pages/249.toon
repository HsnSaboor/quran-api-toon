quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  13,1,"L. M. R. These are verses from the Book; what has been sent down to you by your Lord is the Truth, even though most men do not believe so"
  13,2,God is the One Who has raised up the Heavens without any support you can see. Then He mounted on the Throne and regulated the sun and moon; each runs along on a specific course. He directs the matter; He manifests signs so that you may be convinced about meeting your Lord
  13,3,"He is the One Who has spread the earth out and placed headlands and rivers on it, and has placed two pairs for every kind of fruit on it. He wraps daylight up in night. In that are signs for folk who meditate"
  13,4,"On the earth are neighboring tracts, and vineyards, cultivated fields and datepalms, [growing] in clumps and all alone, watered from a single source. We make some of them excel others in food value. In that are signs for folk who use their reason"
  13,5,"If you should feel astonished, then how much more astonishing is their statement: \"When we have become dust, shall we [end up] in some fresh creation?\" Those are the ones who disbelieve in their Lord; such (persons) will have fetters [placed] around their necks and those will become inmates of the Fire, to live there forever"
