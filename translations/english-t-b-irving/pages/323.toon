quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  21,11,"How many a town which had been doing wrong did We demolish, and raise up other folk in its stead"
  21,12,"When they felt Our might [approaching], they rushed headlong away from it"
  21,13,"Do not rush away; return to what you were luxuriating in and your dwellings, so that you may be questioned"
  21,14,"They say: \"Alas for us! We have been doing wrong"
  21,15,Such an appeal as theirs will never cease until We leave them withered away like a crop in need of harvesting
  21,16,We did not create Heaven and Earth and whatever lies in between them while just playing around
  21,17,"If We had wanted to adopt it as a pastime, We would have adopted it within Our very presence, had We ever done so"
  21,18,"Rather We hurl Truth against falsehood, so it knocks it down. Then it disappears. You are the ones [who need] to worry because of what you are describing"
  21,19,"He owns whoever is in Heaven and Earth. Anyone who is with Him is never too proud to do Him service, nor are they even wearied"
  21,20,"they celebrate [Him] night and day; they never pause"
  21,21,Or have they taken gods from earth who will raise the dead
  21,22,"If there were other gods in either [Heaven or Earth] besides God [Alone], they would both dissolve in chaos. Glory be to God, Lord of the Throne, beyond what they describe"
  21,23,"He will not be questioned about what He does, while they shall be so questioned"
  21,24,"Yet do they still adopt other gods instead of Him? SAY: \"Bring on your proof! This is a Reminder for anyone who is with me, as well as a Reminder for whoever came before me.\" Instead, most of them do not recognize the Truth, so they avoid it"
