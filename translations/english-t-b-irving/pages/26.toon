quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,170,"Whenever someone tells them: \"Follow what God has sent down;\" they say: \"Rather we will follow what we discovered our forefathers were doing,\" even though their forefathers did not use reason in any way nor were they guided"
  2,171,"Those who disbelieve may be compared to those who bleat away at something that only listens to calls and cries: deaf, dumb and blind, they do not use their reason"
  2,172,"You who believe, eat any wholesome things We have provided you with and thank God if it is He whom you worship"
  2,173,"He has only forbidden you what has died by itself, blood and pork, and anything that has been consecrated to something besides God. Yet anyone who may be forced to do so, without craving or going too far, will have no offence held against him; for God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  2,174,Those who hide what God has sent down in the Book and (then) barter it off for a paltry price only suck fire into their bellies. God will not speak to them on Resurrection Day nor will He purify them; they will have painful torment
  2,175,"Those are the ones who have purchased error instead of guidance, and torment instead of forgiveness. Why do they insist on facing the Fire"
  2,176,"That is because God has sent the Book down with the Truth, while those who disagree about the Book go much too far in dissension"
