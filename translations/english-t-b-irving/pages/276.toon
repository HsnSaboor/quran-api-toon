  16,80,"God has granted you your houses as homes to live in, and granted you the skins of livestock [to make] houses which you find so light on the day you pack them up to move elsewhere and the day you come to a halt. From their wool, their fur and their hair come furnishings and commodities for a while"
  16,81,"God has granted you shade out of what He has created, and granted you resorts in the mountains, and granted you garments with which to protect yourselves from the heat as well as garments to ward off your own violence. Thus He completes His favor towards you so that you may commit yourselves to (live in) peace"
  16,82,"Should they still turn away, you have only to announce matters clearly"
  16,83,They recognize God´s favor; then they disregard it. Most of them are disbelievers

  16,85,"When those who do wrong see the torment, it will neither be lightened for them nor will they be granted any delay"

  16,87,"They will proffer their surrender to God on that day, while anything they were inventing will leave them in the lurch"
