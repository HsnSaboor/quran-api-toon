quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  56,51,Then you mistaken rejectors
  56,52,will be eating something from the Infernal Tree
  56,53,filling (your) bellies with it
  56,54,and drinking scalding water in addition
  56,55,"lapping it up, the way thirsty [camels] drink"
  56,56,Such will be their fare on the Day for Repayment
  56,57,"We created you, if you would only acknowledge it"
  56,58,Have you ever considered what you emit
  56,59,"Did you create it, or are We its Creators"
  56,60,We have ordained death for (all of) you; no one will get ahead to prevent Us
  56,61,"from changing your attributes, and transforming you into something you would never recognize"
  56,62,"You know about the first transformation, if you will only recall it"
  56,63,Have you considered what you plant as crops
  56,64,Do you farm it or are We the Farmers
  56,65,"If We so wished, We would turn it into chaff so you would do nothing but exclaim"
  56,66,We are debt-ridden
  56,67,"in fact, we are destitute"
  56,68,Have you ever considered the water you drink
  56,69,"Do you pour down from the rainclouds or are, We its Pourers"
  56,70,"If We so wished, We might make it brackish. If you would only act grateful"
  56,71,Have you considered the Fire you kindle
  56,72,"Are you the ones who grow its trees [for firewood] or are We their Growers"
  56,73,We have granted it as a Reminder and enjoyment for those living in the wilderness
  56,74,So celebrate your Lord´s almighty name
  56,75,Yet I swear by the stars´ positions
  56,76,"it is a serious oath, if you only knew it"
