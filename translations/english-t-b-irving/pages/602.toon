quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,In dealing with the Quraysh
  106,2,for their preparations to travel in winter and in summer
  106,3,let them worship the Lord of this House
  106,4,Who feeds them against famine and secures them from fear
  107,1,Have you seen someone who rejects religion
  107,2,That is the person who pushes the orphan aside
  107,3,and does not promote feeding the needy
  107,4,It will be too bad for the prayerful
  107,5,who are absent-minded as they pray
  107,6,who aim to be noticed
  107,7,while they hold back contributions
  108,1,We have given you plenty
  108,2,so pray to your Lord and sacrifice
  108,3,since your opponent is the one who will be lopped off
