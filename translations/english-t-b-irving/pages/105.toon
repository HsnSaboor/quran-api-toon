quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,171,"People of the Book, do not exaggerate in [practicing] your religion and tell nothing except the Truth about God. Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, was merely God´s messenger and His word which He cast into Mary, and a spirit [proceeding] from Him. Believe in God [Alone] and His messengers, and do not say: ´Three!\" Stopping [it] will be better for you. God is only One God; glory be to Him, beyond His having any son! He owns whatever is in Heaven and whatever is on Earth; God suffices as a Trustee"
  4,172,"The Messiah would never disdain to be God´s servant, nor would the angels who are closest. He will summon anyone to Him who disdains to worship Him and acts too proud [for it]"
  4,173,"As for those who believe and perform honorable deeds, He will pay them their earnings and ad even more for them out of His bounty. He will punish those who a scornful and proud with painful torment; they will not find any sponsor themselves nor any supporter besides God"
  4,174,"Mankind, proof has come to you from your Lord; We have sent a clear Light down to you"
  4,175,"He will show those who believe in God and cling to Him, into mercy and bounty from Himself, and guide them along a Straight Road towards Himself"
