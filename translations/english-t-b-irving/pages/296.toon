quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,21,"Thus We disclosed things to them so they might know that God´s promise has come true and there is no doubt about the Hour. So [people] debated their case among themselves, and they said: \"Build a monument over them. Their Lord is quite Aware of them.\" Those who won out in the end said: \"Let us erect a shrine for them"
  18,22,"They will say: \"[They were] three, the fourth of them being their dog;\" while [others] will say: \"Five, the sixth of them is their dog,\" guessing at the Unseen. [Still others] say: \"Seven, and the eighth of them is their dog.\" SAY: \"My Lord is quite Aware as to how many they were. Only a few know about them.\" Do not discuss them except in a discussion that is obvious, nor seek anyone else´s opinion about them"
  18,23,"Do not say about anything: \"I am doing that tomorrow"
  18,24,"unless [you add]: \"Should God so wish!\" Remember your Lord whenever you might forget, and SAY: ´Perhaps my Lord will guide me even closer than this to proper behavior"
  18,25,And they stayed in their Cave for three hundred years plus nine more
  18,26,"SAY: \"God is quite Aware as to how long they stayed [there]. He holds the Unseen in Heaven and Earth; He is quite Observant of it, quite Alert as well. They have no patron besides Him, nor does He let anyone else share in His discretion"
  18,27,"Quote whatever has been revealed to you from your Lord´s book: there is no one who may change His words, nor will you ever find any sanctuary except in Him"
