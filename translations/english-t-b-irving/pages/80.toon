quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,15,"Should any of your women commit some sexual offence, collect evidence about them from four [persons] among yourselves. If they so testify, then confine the women to their houses until death claims them or God grants them some other way out"
  4,16,"If two of you should indulge in it, trounce them both. If they repent and reform, then ostracize them both. God is Relenting, Merciful"
  4,17,"Repentance holds with God only for those who do evil out of ignorance, then repent shortly after; those God turns to. God is Aware, Wise"
  4,18,"Repentance is not for those who perform evil deeds until one of them says: \"I have just now repented!\", just as death faces him. Nor is it for those who die while they are disbelievers; for those We reserved painful torment"
  4,19,"You who believe, it is not lawful for you to inherit anything from women against their will; do not hinder them from remarrying so that you may make off with part of what you have given them, unless they indulge in flagrant sexual misconduct. Treat them politely; even if you dislike them, perhaps you dislike something in which God has placed much good"
