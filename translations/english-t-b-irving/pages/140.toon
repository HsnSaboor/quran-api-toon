quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,95,"God is the One Who splits the seed and kernel, He brings the living from the dead, and is the One Who brings the dead from the living. Such is God; yet still you shrug Him off"
  6,96,"Kindler of morn, He grants night for repo and the sun and moon for telling time. Such is the measure of the Powerful, the Aware"
  6,97,"He is the One Who has placed the stars to guide you through darkness on land and at sea, We have spelled out signs for people who know"
  6,98,"It is He Who has reproduced you from a single soul, and [granted you] a settlement [on earth] and a resting place [after death]. We have spelled out signs for people who understand"
  6,99,"It is He Who sends down water from the sky. Thus We bring forth plants of every type with it; We produce green vegetation from it. We produce grain from it piled tight packed on one another, and from the datepalm, clusters close at hand produced from its pollen, as well as orchards full of grapes, olives and pomegranates, which are so similar and yet dissimilar. Look at their fruit as He causes it to grow and ripen. In that are signs for folk who believe"
  6,100,"They have set up sprites as associates with God, even though created them! They have even dared to impute sons and daughters to Him without having any knowledge. Glory be to Him; Exalted is He over whatever they describe"
  6,101,Deviser of Heaven and earth! How can He save a son while He has no consort? He created everything and is aware of everything
