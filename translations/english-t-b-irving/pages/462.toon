  39,38,"If you should ask them who created Heaven and Earth, they would say: \"God.\" SAY: \"Have you (all) ever seen what you appeal to instead of to God [Alone]? If God wanted [to cause] me any trouble, would such females ever remove His trouble? Or if He wants some mercy for me, will such females hold back His mercy?\" SAY: \"God is [the Means] by Which I reckon; on Him do the reliant rely"
  39,39,"SAY: \"My people, act according to your situation. I am so acting, and you shall know"
