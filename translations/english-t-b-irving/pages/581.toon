quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Do We not create you (all) from a despised fluid
  77,21,We place it in a firm resting-place
  77,22,for a known period
  77,23,We measure it out and how favored are Those Who measure it
  77,24,It will be too bad for rejectors on that day
  77,25,Have We not placed the earth as a round up
  77,26,for the living and the dead
  77,27,We have planted lofty headlands on it and offered you (all) fresh water to drink
  77,28,It will be too bad for rejectors on that day
  77,29,Hurry off to whatever you have been rejecting
  77,30,Hurry away to shade which has three sections
  77,31,which is not shady nor any help against flame
  77,32,"It throws off sparks like a palace [on fire]"
  77,33,"[bright] as a yellow camel herd"
  77,34,It will be too bad for rejectors on that day
  77,35,"This will be a day when they will not utter [a sound]"
  77,36,nor will they be permitted to offer any excuse
  77,37,It will be too bad for rejectors on that day
  77,38,"This is a day for Sorting [things] out; We shall bring you (all) together with the original men"
  77,39,"If you have any scheme, then scheme against me"
  77,40,It will be too bad for rejectors on that day! Those who Do their Duty
  77,41,The heedful will be in shady nooks by springs
  77,42,and have whatever fruit they may hanker for
  77,43,Eat and drink at leisure because of what you have been doing
  77,44,Thus We reward those who act kindly
  77,45,It will be too bad for rejectors on that day
  77,46,"Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little while, since you are criminals"
  77,47,It will be too bad for rejectors on that day
  77,48,"When someone told them: \"Bow your heads!\", they would not bow their heads [in prayer]"
  77,49,It will be too bad for rejectors on that day
  77,50,Yet what report will they believe in later on
