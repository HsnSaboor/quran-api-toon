  71,3,"serve God and heed Him, and obey me"
  71,4,"He will forgive some of your offences for you and postpone things for you until a specific deadline. God´s deadline will never be postponed once it comes, if you only realized it"

  71,10,"and said: ´Seek forgiveness from your Lord; He has been so Forgiving"
