quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"They may be compared to someone who kindles a fire, and once it lights up whatever lies around him, God takes away their light and leaves them in darkness. They do not see"
  2,18,"deaf, dumb and blind will never respond"
  2,19,"Or to a raincloud from the sky containing darkness, Thunder and lightning; they stick their fingers in their ears to ward off death of the thunderclaps, for God will soon be rounding up disbelievers"
  2,20,"Lightning almost snatches their sight away: each time it lights things up for them, they walk along in it, while when darkness settles down on them, they stand stockstill. If God wanted, He would take away their hearing and eyesight; God is capable of everything"
  2,21,"Mankind, worship your Lord Who created you as well as those before you, so that you may do your duty"
  2,22,"[He is] the One Who has made the earth a carpet for you and had the sky built above you, and sent water to pour down from the sky and brought forth fruit by means of it as sustenance for you. Do not set up rivals for God while you know [better]"
  2,23,"If you (all) are in any doubt about what We have sent down to Our servant, then bring a chapter like it and call in your witnesses besides God if you are so truthful"
  2,24,If you do not-and you will never do so-then heed the Fire which has been prepared for disbelievers whose fuel is mankind and stones
