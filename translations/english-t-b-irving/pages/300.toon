quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  18,54,We have spelled out every sort of example for mankind in this Quran yet everyman uses it just for argument in most cases
  18,55,"What has prevented men from believing and seeking forgiveness from their Lord, once guidance has come to them, except [they may wish] that the practice of primitive people should come along with them, or that torment come face to face with them"
  18,56,We have sent emissaries merely as heralds and warners while those who disbelieve idly argue away so they may refute the Truth by means of it. They treat My signs and what they are warned of as a joke
  18,57,"Who is more in the wrong than someone who has been reminded about his Lord´s signs and then avoids them, and forgets anything his hands may have sent on ahead? We have placed wrappings over their hearts and dullness in their ears lest they understand it. Even if you called them to guidance, they still would never consent to be guided"
  18,58,"Your Lord is the Forgiving, the Possessor of Mercy. If He were to take them to task for what they have earned, He would hasten torment for them; instead they have their appointment from which they will never find any asylum"
  18,59,"Such towns have We destroyed whenever they did wrong, and We fixed the time for their destruction"
  18,60,"And so Moses told his young man: \"I shall not give up until I reach the place where both seas meet, even though I spend ages doing so"
  18,61,"So when they reached the place where they had met, they forgot their fish, which took its way to the sea as if it went out through a drain"
