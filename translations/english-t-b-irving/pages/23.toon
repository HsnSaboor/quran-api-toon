quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,146,Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it just as they recognize their own children. Nevertheless a group of them hide the Truth even though they know it
  2,147,"Truth comes from your Lord, so do not be a doubter"
  2,148,"Everyone has some course he steers by, so compete in [doing] good deeds. Wherever you may be, God will bring you all together; God is Capable of everything"
  2,149,"No matter where you may set out from, turn your face towards the Hallowed Mosque. It means the Truth from your Lord; nor will God overlook whatever you are doing"
  2,150,"No matter where you set out from, turn your face towards the Hallowed Mosque; wherever you may be, turn your faces towards it, so that people will not have any argument against you, except for those among them who do wrong. Do not dread them but dread Me, so I may complete My favor towards you and so that you may be guided"
  2,151,"just as We have sent a messenger to you from among yourselves to recite My signs to you, and to cleanse you and teach you the Book and wisdom, and to teach you what you did not know"
  2,152,"Remember Me; I shall remember you. Thank Me, and do not act ungrateful with Me"
  2,153,"You who believe, seek help through patience and prayer; God stands alongside the patient"
