quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  21,36,"Whenever those who disbelieve see you, they never accept you unless it is to ridicule you: \"Is this the person who mentions your gods?\", while they disown any mention of the Mercy-giving"
  21,37,Man has been created from impatience. I will show you My signs so do not try to hurry Me up
  21,38,"They say: \"When will this promise be, if you are (all) so truthful"
  21,39,"If those who disbelieve only knew about the time when they will not fend the Fire off from their faces nor from their backs, nor will they be supported"
  21,40,Rather it will come upon them suddenly and dumbfound them; they will not manage to cast it off nor will they be allowed to wait
  21,41,"Messengers have been ridiculed before you, till whatever they were sneering at swept in around those who had been ridiculing them"
  21,42,"SAY: \"Who shields you night and day from the Mercy-giving?.\" Indeed they are evasive about mentioning their Lord"
  21,43,Or do they have gods who can defend them from Us? They can neither assist themselves nor yet are they accompanied by Us
  21,44,Rather We have let such persons and their forefathers enjoy themselves until life seems to last too long for them. Do they not see how We come to the earth to clip it off along its borders? Will they turn out to be the winners
