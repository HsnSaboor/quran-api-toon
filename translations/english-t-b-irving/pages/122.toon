quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"When they listen to what has been sent down to the Messenger, you will see their eyes well up with tears because of the Truth they recognize. They say: \"Our Lord, we believe, so enroll us among the witnesses"
  5,84,Why should we not believe in God and any Truth that has come to us? We yearn for our Lord to admit us along with honorable folk
  5,85,God will compensate them with gardens through which rivers flow to live in forever because of what they have said. Such will be the reward of those who act kindly
  5,86,while those who disbelieve and reject Our signs will become the inmates of Hades
  5,87,"You who believe, do not forbid any wholesome things which God has permitted you, nor exceed the limits. God does not love the defiant"
  5,88,"Eat any lawful, wholesome thing which God has provided you with. Heed God in Whom you are believers"
  5,89,"God will not take you to task for what you may rattle off in your oaths, but He does take you to task for anything you have sworn to solemnly [and then ignored]. Exoneration for it means feeding ten paupers with the average of what you would feed your own families, or clothing them, or freeing a captive. Whoever does not find the wherewithal [to do so], should fast for three days. This is what penance involves in order to free yourselves from any oath you have sworn [loosely]. Keep your word; thus God explains His signs to you, so you may act grateful"
