quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  30,25,"Among His signs are [the fact] that the sky and earth hold firm at His command. Then whenever He calls you forth out of the earth once and for all, you will (all) come forth"
  30,26,Anyone who is in Heaven and Earth belongs to Him; all are subservient to Him
  30,27,"He is the One Who starts out with creation; then He performs it all over again. It is quite simple for Him [to do]. He sets the Supreme Example in Heaven and Earth; He is the Powerful, the Wise"
  30,28,"He offers you an example form among yourselves. Do you have any partners for what We have provided you with among those whom your right hand controls? Do you [feel] the same in such a case so that you fear [these servants] just as you fear one another? Thus We spell out signs for folk who will use their reason"
  30,29,Rather the ones who do wrong follow their own whims without having any knowledge. Who will guide someone whom God has let go astray? They will have no supporters
  30,30,"So keep your face set enquiringly towards the [true] religion, God´s natural handiwork along which lines He has patterned mankind. There is no way to alter God´s creation. That is the correct religion, though most men do not realize it"
  30,31,"even as they turn towards Him. Heed Him and keep up prayer, and do not be one of those who associate [others with Him]"
  30,32,such as the ones who split up their religion and form sects. Each party is happy with whatever lies before them
