quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,39,"Those who have been wronged are permitted to fight [back]-since God is Able to support them"
  22,40,"any who have been driven from their homes unjustly, merely because they say: \"Our Lord is God [Alone].\" If it were not because God repels some men by means of others, cloisters, churches, synagogues and mosques where God´s name is mentioned frequently would have been demolished. God supports anyone who supports Him-God is Strong, Powerful"
  22,41,"those who, if We established them in the land, would keep up prayer and pay the welfare tax, command what is proper and forbid debauchery. God holds the destiny of things"
  22,42,"If they should reject you, well Noah´s folk and cad´s and Thamud´s (all) rejected [messengers] before them"
  22,43,"and [so did] Abraham´s folk and Lot´s folk"
  22,44,"and the inhabitants of Midian; even Moses was rejected! I put up with disbelievers; then I seize them, and how [awful] is My repudiation"
  22,45,"How many towns have We wiped out while they were doing wrong?. Their rafters have fallen in, their wells have been abandoned, and [many an] impressive palace as well"
  22,46,"Have they not travelled around the earth so they may acquire hearts to reason with or ears to listen with? It is not their eyesight which is blind, but their hearts in their breasts which are blind"
