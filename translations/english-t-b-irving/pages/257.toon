quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  14,11,"Their messengers told them: \"We are only human like yourselves, but God showers blessings on any of His servants whom He wishes. It is not for us to bring you any authority except with God´s permission. On God should believers rely"
  14,12,"Why should we not rely on God when He has guided us along our [several] ways? And so we may patiently endure how you persecute us? On God [Alone] should the reliant rely"
  14,13,"Those who disbelieved told their messengers: \"We´ll run you out of our land unless you return to our sect!\" Their Lord [however] inspired them [as follows]: \"We shall wipe out wrongdoers"
  14,14,"and settle you on the land to succeed them.\" That is [in store] for anyone who fears My position and fears My threat"
  14,15,"They sought to conquer, and every stubborn oppressor blundered"
  14,16,Beyond him there lies Hell where he will be given stagnant water to drink
  14,17,"He will gag on it and not quite swallow it. Death will come at him from everywhere, while he will not quite die. Beyond him lies harsh torment"
  14,18,The works of those who disbelieve in their Lord may be compared to ashes which the wind whips around on a stormy day. They cannot do a thing with anything they have earned. That is going far afield
