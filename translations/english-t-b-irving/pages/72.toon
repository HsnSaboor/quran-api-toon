quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,166,"Whatever happened to you on the day when both troops clashed, occurred with God´s permission, so He might recognize believers"
  3,167,"and recognize those who act hypocritically. They were told: \"Come fight in God´s way or [at least] defend yourselves.\" They said: \"If we knew how to fight, we would follow you.\" They were nearer disbelief than faith that day. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts; although God is quite Aware of what they are concealing"
  3,168,"Those who tell their brethren while they remain behind: \"if they had obeyed us, they would not have been killed,\" should be told: ´Avert death from yourselves if you are so truthful"
  3,169,"Do not reckon those who are killed for God´s sake are dead, but rather [they Martyrs are] living; they will be provided for by their Lord"
  3,170,"so happy will they be with whatever God has given them out of His bounty, and rejoicing for those they left behind who have not yet overtaken them. No fear will fall on them nor will they be saddened"
  3,171,"they will rejoice because of favor and bounty from God, since God does not deprive believers of their wages"
  3,172,"Any persons who respond to God and the Messenger after some sore has afflicted them, those who act kindly and do their duty, will have a splendid fee"
  3,173,"Those whom people have told: ´Some people have gathered to [oppose] you, so be on your guard against them!´; yet it increased them in faith and they said: \"God is our Reckoning, and how splendid is such an Administrator!´"
