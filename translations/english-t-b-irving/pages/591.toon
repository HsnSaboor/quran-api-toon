quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the sky and the Nightcomer
  86,2,What will make you realize what the Nightcomer is
  86,3,"The star shining [before dawn]"
  86,4,"Each soul has a guardian [set up] over it"
  86,5,so let everyman notice what he has been created from
  86,6,He was created from a fluid ejected
  86,7,from between his backbone and his ribs
  86,8,He is Able to revive him
  86,9,on a day when secrets will be tested
  86,10,"so he will have no strength [left] nor any supporter"
  86,11,By the sky with its cycle
  86,12,by the earth cracking open
  86,13,it is a decisive statement
  86,14,It is no joke
  86,15,They are hatching some plot
  86,16,while I too am hatching a plot
  86,17,so put up with disbelievers; put up with them as long as you can
  87,1,"Glorify the name of your Lord, the All-Highest"
  87,2,Who has created and fashioned
  87,3,Who has proportioned and guided
  87,4,Who brings forth pasturage
  87,5,then turns it into weather-beaten stubble
  87,6,"We shall make you recite, so do not forget [anything]"
  87,7,except whatever God may wish; He knows the obvious and what is hidden
  87,8,We will make it easy for you to take the easy way
  87,9,"so remind [men], if reminding will benefit [anyone]"
  87,10,Anyone who feels afraid will be reminded
  87,11,while the unluckiest
  87,12,"the one who will roast in the greatest Fire, shunts it aside"
  87,13,"then he will neither die in it, nor yet live there"
  87,14,Anyone who purifies himself
  87,15,"mentions his Lord´s name and prays, will prosper"
