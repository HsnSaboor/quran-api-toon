quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,32,"Those who were overbearing will tell those who acted like weaklings: \"Did we block you off from guidance once it came to you? Rather you yourselves were guilty"
  34,33,"Those who had been despised will tell those who were overbearing: \"Rather there was plotting night and day when you ordered us to disbelieve in God and we set up rivals to him.\" They will conceal their regret once they see the torment; We will place fetters around the necks of those who disbelieve. Will they not be rewarded for just what they have been doing"
  34,34,"We have sent no town a warner unless its high-livers said: \"We are disbelievers in what you have been sent with"
  34,35,"They say: \"We have more wealth and children, and will not be tormented"
  34,36,"SAY: \"My Lord extends sustenance to anyone He wishes and budgets it, even though most men do not realize it"
  34,37,It is not your wealth nor your children that will bring you close to Us in patronage; only someone who believes and acts honorably (will do so). Those will have a double reward because of what they have done. They will feel secure in mansions
  34,38,while those who were attempting to thwart 0ur signs will be paraded forth into torment
  34,39,"SAY: \"My Lord extends sustenance to anyone He wishes among His servants and He budgets it out. He will compensate you for anything you have spent since He is the best Provider"
