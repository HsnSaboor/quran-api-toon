quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,171,"Thus We suspended the Mountain over them as if it were an awning, and they thought it was going to fall down on them: \"Hold on firmly to anything We have given you and remember what is in it, so that you may do your duty"
  7,172,"When your Lord took their offspring from the Children of Adam´s loins, and made them bear witness about themselves: ´Am I not your Lord?\"; they said: ´Of course, we testify to it!\" lest you (all) might say on Resurrection Day: \"We were unaware of this"
  7,173,"or lest you say: \"It was only our forefathers who associated [others with God] previously; offspring following them. Will You wipe us out because of what futile men have done"
  7,174,Thus We spell out signs so that they may repent
  7,175,"Recite news to them about someone to whom We gave Our signs. He slipped away from them, so Satan followed him and he became misguided"
  7,176,"If We had so wished, We might have raised him up by means of them, but he clung to the earth and followed his own whim. He might be compared to a dog: no matter how you drive him off, he just pants away. Or if you leave him alone, he still pants on. That is what folk who reject Our signs are like; tell such stories so they may think things over"
  7,177,How evil is the comparison of folk who reject Our signs; it is their own souls they hurt
  7,178,Anyone whom God guides has been (really) guided; while those He lets go astray will he the losers
