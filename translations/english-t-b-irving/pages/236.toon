  12,7,There were signs for inquirers in Joseph and his brothers
  12,8,"when they said; \"Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are, even though we are a closed group. Our father is clearly mistaken"
  12,9,"[Let´s] kill Joseph or throw him into exile in some land so your father´s attention will be absorbed in (all of) you, and later on you will be honorable folk"
  12,10,"One among them spoke up and said: \"Don´t kill Joseph; toss him into the bottom of the cistern so some travellers may pick him up, if you must do something"
