quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,107,"Those who adopt a mosque for [working] mischief and disbelief, as well as disunion among believers and as an outpost for anyone who has already warred on God and His messenger, will swear: \"We only wanted to be kind!\" God witnesses what sort of liars they are"
  9,108,"Never stand in it! It is more fitting for you to stand in a mosque which has been founded on performing one´s duty from the very first day in which there are men who love to be purified, God loves those who cleanse themselves"
  9,109,"Is someone who founds his building on heeding and pleasing God better, or someone who founds his building along the edge of a crumbling bluff, so it crumbles along with him into Hell fire? God does not guide such wrongful folk"
  9,110,"the building which they have built is continually in doubt within their hearts, till their hearts are torn pieces. God is Aware, Wise"
  9,111,"God has bought up their persons and their property from believers, so they may have the Garden [instead). They fight for God´s sake; they kill and are killed as a rightful promise from Him [to be found] in the Old Testament, the Gospel and the Quran. Who is more Trustworthy with His word than God? So rejoice in your bargain which you have reached with Him. That will be the supreme Achievement"
