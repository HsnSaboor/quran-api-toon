quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,15,"When Our clear signs are recited to those who do not expect to meet Us, they say: \"Bring some other Reading than this, or else change it!\" SAY: \"It is not up to me to change it of my own accord, because of whatever I may encounter in it on my own. I merely follow what is inspired in me. I fear torment on an awful day if I should disobey my Lord"
  10,16,"SAY: \"If God had so wished, I would not have recited it to you nor advised you about it. I lived for a lifetime among you before [receiving] it. So will you not use your reason"
  10,17,Who is more in the wrong than someone who invents a lie about God or rejects His signs? It is a fact that criminals will not succeed
  10,18,"Instead of God they serve what neither harms nor benefits them, and they say: \"These are our intercessors with God.\" SAY: \"Do you [presume to] notify God about something in Heaven and on Earth that He already does not know? Glory be to Him; Exalted is He over whatever they associate [with Him]"
  10,19,"Mankind was once just one nation; then they disagreed. If word had not come on ahead from your Lord, what they had been disagreeing over would have been settled for them"
  10,20,"They say: \"If a sign were only sent down by his Lord for him!\"; SO SAY: \"The Unseen belongs only to God, so wait: I am waiting alongside you"
