quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"He said: \"Yet what is your errand, 0 emissaries"
  51,32,"They said: \"We have been sent to a criminal folk"
  51,33,to launch clay pellets on them
  51,34,marked by your Lord for the dissipated
  51,35,So We brought out anyone there who were believers
  51,36,though We found only one house with Muslims in it
  51,37,We left a sign there for those who fear painful torment
  51,38,And with Moses when We sent him off with clear authority to Pharaoh
  51,39,"who turned away with his warlords and said: \"[He´s either] a magician or a madman"
  51,40,We seized him and his troops and hurled them into the deep while he was to blame
  51,41,"And with Ad, when We loosed a devastating wind on them"
  51,42,it left nothing that it chanced upon without turning it into rubble
  51,43,"And with Thamud when someone told them: \"Enjoy things for a while"
  51,44,"They strutted around against their Lord´s command, as the Thunderbolt caught them while they were looking on"
  51,45,They were unable to withstand it nor were they supported
  51,46,And Noah´s people had already been such immoral folk
  51,47,The sky We have built firmly and We are extending it
  51,48,The earth have We spread out; how Blissful is the One Who has smoothed it off
  51,49,With everything We have created pairs so that you may be reminded
  51,50,"so flee to God: \"I am a plain warner to you from Him"
  51,51,"Do not place any other deity alongside God [Alone]: I am a plain warner to you from Him"
