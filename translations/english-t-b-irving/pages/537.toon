quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,that it is a Noble Quran
  56,78,"[kept] as a treasured Book"
  56,79,which none but the purified may touch
  56,80,something sent down by the Lord of the Universe
  56,81,Are you (all) trying to dodge this report
  56,82,"Are you making [the fact] that you reject it into your means of livelihood"
  56,83,"Why not -when [your soul] leaps to your throat [at death]"
  56,84,and you are then observing
  56,85,"We are even Nearer to it than you are, even though you do not notice it"
  56,86,provided you are not under any obligation
  56,87,answer back if you are truthful
  56,88,Thus if he is one of those who are drawn close
  56,89,"[he will have] contentment, fragrance, and a garden of bliss"
  56,90,while if he is one of the Companions on the Right
  56,91,"Peace be on you [will be the greeting) from the Companions on the Right"
  56,92,However if he is one of the mistaken rejectors
  56,93,a welcome of scalding water
  56,94,"plus a roasting in Hades [will await him]"
  56,95,This is the absolute Truth
  56,96,So celebrate our Lord´s almighty name
  57,1,"Whatever is in Heaven and Earth celebrates God. He is the Powerful, the Wise"
  57,2,He holds control over Heaven and Earth. He grants life and brings death; He is Capable of everything
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last, the Outward and the Innermost. He is Aware of everything! And Omniscience"
