quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  13,6,"They want to hasten you on to commit evil rather than [to perform] a fine deed. Examples have already been set before them. Your Lord possesses forgiveness for mankind, no matter how wrong they are; though your Lord still is Stern with punishment"
  13,7,"Those who disbelieve say: \"If only a sign were sent down from his Lord!\" Yet you are only a warner; each folk has a guide"
  13,8,"God knows what every female bears, and how some wombs may miscarry or else may wait too long. Everything has its measure with Him"
  13,9,"Knowing the Unseen and the Visible, [He is] the Great, the Exalted"
  13,10,"It is all the same for you whether one of you is secretive about what he says or speaks out about it, and whether one keeps to himself night and struts around by day"
  13,11,"he has [angels] checking from both before him and behind him; they guard him at God´s command. God does not change what any people may have until they change whatever they themselves have. Whenever God wants something bad [to happen] to any people, there is no way to avert it nor have they any patron except for Him"
  13,12,He is the 0ne Who shows you lightning to inspire both fear and expectation. He whips up the heavy clouds
  13,13,Thunder hymns His praise while angels stand in awe of Him. He sends down thunderbolts and strikes anyone He wishes with them. Yet they argue on and on about God while He is Stern in strategy
