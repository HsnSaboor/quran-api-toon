  44,40,The Day for Sorting things out will mean an appointment for everyone
  44,41,a day when no patron will be able to help a favorite out in any way nor will they be supported
  44,42,"except for someone whom God has shown mercy to. He is the Powerful, the Merciful"
  44,43,The infernal tree
  44,44,will be food for the sinner
  44,45,"like molten copper, it will seethe inside (their) bellies"
  44,46,like a bathhouse boiler
  44,47,Take him and drag him into the midst of Hades
  44,48,Then pour some torment of scalding water over his head
  44,49,"´Taste it; you were such a powerful noble!\"´"
  44,50,"This is what you (all) were puzzling over!\"´"
  44,51,The heedful will be in a safe position
  44,52,among gardens and springs
  44,53,"They will wear satin and brocade as they sit facing one another, just like that"
  44,54,and We will wed them to dark-eyed damsels
  44,55,They will call confidently for every kind of fruit in it
  44,56,"They will not taste death there except for the very first death [they had]. He will shield them from the torment of Hades"
  44,57,as a boon from your Lord; that will be the supreme Achievement
  44,58,"We have made it easy for your tongue [to recite] in order that they may bear this in mind"
  44,59,"So watch out: they too are watching"
