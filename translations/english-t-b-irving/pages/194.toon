quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,41,"March forth light or heavy [-armed], and strive in God´s cause with your property and persons. That will be best for you if you only realize it"
  9,42,"If there had been some goods to be acquired closer by and on a shorter journey, they would have followed you; but the expedition seemed much too far for them. They will swear by God; \"If we could have managed to, we would have left along with you (all).\" They destroy their own souls while God knows what liars they are"
  9,43,May God pardon you! Why did you permit them to do so before it was explained to you which ones were truthful so you might recognize the liars
  9,44,Those who believe in God and the Last Day do not ask you to excuse them from striving with their property and persons. God is Aware as to who are heedful
  9,45,Only those who do not believe in God and the Last Day ask you to excuse them. Their hearts are in such doubt that they even waver in their doubt
  9,46,"If they had wanted to sally forth, they would have made some preparation for it; but God disliked their being delegated to do so, so He let them lag behind. They were told: \"Sit around among the shirkers"
  9,47,"Even if they had left with you, they would only have meant more turmoil for you; they would have galloped in among you and stirred up dissension for you. Among you there were some who would listen to them. God is Aware of those who do wrong"
