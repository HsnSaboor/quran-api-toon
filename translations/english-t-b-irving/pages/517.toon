quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  49,12,"You who believe, refrain from conjecturing too much: even a little suspicion forms a vice. Do not spy on one another, nor let any of you backbite others. Would one of you like to eat his dead brother´s flesh? You would loathe it! Heed God, for God is Relenting, Merciful"
  49,13,"mankind, We have created you from a male and female, and set you up as nations and tribes so you may recognize [and cooperate with] one another. The noblest among you with God is that one of you who best performs his duty; God is Aware, Informed"
  49,14,"The desert Arabs say: \"We believe.\" SAY: \"You have not yet believed, but say [instead]: ´We commit ourselves to [live in] peace´. Yet belief has not penetrated your hearts. If you obey God and His messenger, He will not slight you in any of your actions. God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  49,15,Believers are merely the ones who believe in God and His messenger; then never doubt and strive for God´s sake with their property and persons. Those are reliable
  49,16,"SAY: \"Would you [presume to] teach God something concerning your religion? God knows whatever is in Heaven and whatever is on Earth. God is Aware of everything"
  49,17,"They want you to feet flattered because they have entered Islam. SAY: \"You do not flatter me with your commitment to [live in] peace; rather God flatters you, provided you are loyal, since He has guided you to faith"
  49,18,God knows the Unseen part of Heaven and Earth. God is observant of anything you do
