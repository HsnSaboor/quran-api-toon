quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  18,16,"When you withdraw from them and whatever they serve instead of God, then seek shelter in the Cave. Your Lord will spread some of His mercy over you and make fitting arrangements for you in your affair"
  18,17,"You should have seen how the sun as it rose, swerved away from their Cave toward the right; and as it set, slanted off toward the left of them, while they lay in a space in between. That was one of God´s signs. Anyone whom God guides, remains guided; while anyone He lets go astray will never find any patron to set him straight"
  18,18,"You would reckon they were awake, while they [really] lay there asleep. We turned them over on the right and on the left, while their dog lay stretched out with his forepaws over the threshold. If you had chanced upon them, you would have turned and fled from them; you would have been filled with awe of them"
  18,19,"Even so We raised them up again so they might question one another. One of them spoke up and said: \"How long have you stayed [here]?\" They said: \"We have stayed a day, or part of a day.\" They said: \"Your Lord is quite Aware of how long you have stayed [here], so send one of your men to the city with this coin of yours. Let him see which food is the most suitable and bring you [back] a supply of it. Let him act discreetly and not make anyone aware of you"
  18,20,"If they should find out about you, they will stone you or make you turn back to their sect. You would never succeed then"
