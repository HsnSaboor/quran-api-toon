  57,12,"Some day you will see believing men and believing women with their light streaming on ahead of them and off to their right: \"Your good news today [consists of] gardens through which rivers flow, to live in forever!\" That will be the splendid Achievement"
  57,13,"Someday hypocritical men and hypocritical women will tell the ones who believe: \"Wait for us; we need to borrow a fight from you!\" Someone will say: \"Go on back the way you came, and request a light [somewhere else]!\" So a wall will rise up between them which will have a door in it; inside there will be mercy while outside facing it there will be torment"
  57,14,"They will call out to them: \"Were we not with you?\" They will say: \"Of course, but you tempted one another, and let yourselves waver and doubt. [Your saying] ´Amens´ [to everybody] has deceived you till God´s command came along. The Deceiver has even deluded you concerning God"
  57,15,"So today no redemption will be accepted from you nor from those who disbelieve: your lodging shall be the Fire; it is your patron and how awful is such a goal"
  57,16,"Is it not high time for the hearts of those who believe to submit to God´s reminder and any truth that has been sent down? Let them not act like the ones who were given the Book previously: the waiting period seemed too long for them, so their hearts were hardened, and many of them became immoral"
