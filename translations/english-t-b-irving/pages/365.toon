  25,56,We have only sent you as a herald and a warner
  25,57,"SAY: \"I do not ask you for any payment for it except that anyone who wishes to may accept a way unto his Lord"
  25,58,Rely on the Living One Who never dies. Hymn His praise! Sufficient is it for Him to be Informed about His servants´ offences
  25,59,"since He is the One Who created Heaven and Earth as well as whatever lies in between them, in six days. Then the Mercy-giving mounted on the Throne. Ask any informed (person) about Him"
  25,60,"When they are told: \"Bow down on your knees before the Mercy-giving,\" they say: \"What is the Mercy-giving\" Are we to bow down on our knees just because you order us to?\" It merely increases their disdain"
  25,61,"Blessed is the One Who has placed constellations in the sky and set a beacon in it, plus a shining moon"
  25,62,"He is the One Who has granted night and daytime in succession for anyone who wants to reflect (on it) or wants [to show] gratitude"
  25,63,"and the Mercy-giving´s servants who walk modestly on earth and peacefully say: \"How do you do!\" whenever ignorant men address them"
  25,64,who spend the night bowing down on their knees and standing before their Lord
  25,65,"and who say: \"Our Lord, ward off Hell´s torment from us! Its torment is atrocious"
  25,66,it is such an evil residence and station
  25,67,"who when they spend, give neither too lavishly nor yet hold back and keep to a happy medium"
