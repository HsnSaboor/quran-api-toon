quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  36,28,"We did not send any army down from Heaven to his folk after him, nor do We ever send any down"
  36,29,"There was only a single Blast, and imagine, they [lay] shriveled up"
  36,30,What a pity it is with such worshippers! No messenger has ever come to them unless they made fun of him
  36,31,Have they not seen how many generations We have wiped out before them who will never return to them
  36,32,Each will be arraigned so they all stand before Us
  36,33,The dead earth serves as a sign for them; We revive it and bring forth grain from it which they may eat
  36,34,"We have placed date groves and vineyards on it, and make springs flow forth from it"
  36,35,"so they may eat its fruit. Their own hands did not produce it. So, will they not give thanks"
  36,36,"Glory be to the One Who has created every kind of species such as the earth grows, their own kind, and even some things they do not know"
  36,37,Another sign for them is night; We strip daylight off from it so they are plunged into darkness
  36,38,"The sun runs along on a course of its own. Such is the design of the Powerful, the Aware"
  36,39,And We have designed phases for the moon so it finally appears again like an old palm frond
  36,40,The sun dare not overtake the moon nor does night outpace the day. Each floats along in its own orbit
