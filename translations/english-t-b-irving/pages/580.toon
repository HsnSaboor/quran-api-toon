  76,26,and during the night; bow down on your knees before Him and glorify Him all night long
  76,27,"Those people love a fleeting show, and leave a heavy day behind them"
  76,28,"We too have created them and strengthened their sinews. Whenever We wish, We will replace them with others like them in exchange"
  76,29,"This is merely a Reminder; anyone who wishes, may adopt a way to [meet] his Lord"
  76,30,"Anything you (all) wish is only if God so wishes too; God is Aware, Wise"
  76,31,"He will admit anyone He wishes into His mercy, while He has prepared painful torment for wrongdoers"
  77,1,"By the [winds] sent forth for a purpose"
  77,2,and gales that rage on and on
  77,3,scattering things around
  77,4,then dividing them all up
  77,5,and delivering a Reminder
  77,6,either as a plea or a warning
  77,7,you (all) are surely promised something inevitable
  77,8,When the stars fade away
  77,9,when the sky splits open
  77,10,when mountains are pulverized
  77,11,and when messengers´ time is set

  77,13,"Till the day for Sorting [things] out"
  77,14,What will make you realize what the day for Sorting is
  77,15,It will be too bad for rejectors on that day
  77,16,Did We not wipe out ancient men
  77,17,Then We followed them up with later ones
  77,18,Thus We deal with criminals
  77,19,It will be too bad for rejectors on that day
