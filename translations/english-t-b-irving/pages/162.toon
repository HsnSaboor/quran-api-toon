quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,88,"The elders among his people who had acted proudly said: \"We´ll run you out of our town, Shuayb, as well as those who believe along with you; or else you will return to our sect!\" He said: \"Even though we detest it"
  7,89,"We´d invent a lie about God if we returned to your sect now after God has saved us from it. There is no means for us to return to it unless God our Lord should wish us to; our Lord comprises everything in knowledge. On God have we relied. Our Lord, really deliver us from our own people; You are the best Deliverer"
  7,90,"The elders among his people who disbelieved said: ´If you follow Shuayb, you will then be losers"
  7,91,"So the Tremor caught them, and one morning they lay cowering in their homes"
  7,92,"those who rejected Shuayb [ended up] as if they had never been so wealthy in them; those who rejected Shuayb were the losers"
  7,93,"So he turned away from them and said: ´My people, I have delivered my Lord´s messages to you and counseled you sincerely. Why should I grieve over a disbelieving folk"
  7,94,"We have never sent a prophet into any town unless We [first] seized its people with suffering and hardship, so that they might he humbled"
  7,95,"Then We turned evil into good so that they were thriving, and said: ´Both hardship and happiness befell our ancestors.\" So We seized them suddenly while they did not even notice it"
