quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun has been extinguished
  81,2,when the stars slip out of place
  81,3,when the mountains travel along
  81,4,when ten-month pregnant camels are neglected
  81,5,when wild beasts are herded together
  81,6,when the seas overflow
  81,7,when souls are reunited
  81,8,when the buried girl is asked
  81,9,for what offence she has been killed
  81,10,when scriptures are unrolled
  81,11,when the sky is stripped bare
  81,12,when Hades is set blazing
  81,13,when the Garden is brought close
  81,14,each soul shall know what it has prepared
  81,15,So I swear by the planets
  81,16,"moving, sweeping along"
  81,17,and night as it draws on
  81,18,and morn when it breathes again
  81,19,it is a statement by a generous messenger
  81,20,possessing strength established by the One Enthroned
  81,21,Who is to be Obeyed and more than that is Trustworthy
  81,22,Your companion is not crazy
  81,23,He saw him on the clear horizon
  81,24,nor was he grudging about the Unseen
  81,25,"Nor is it a statement [made] by some outcast Satan"
  81,26,So where are you (all) heading for
  81,27,"It is merely a Reminder to [everyone in] the Universe"
  81,28,So anyone of you who wishes may go straight
  81,29,"Yet you will only wish whatever God, Lord of the Universe, may wish"
