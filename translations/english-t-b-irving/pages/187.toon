quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  9,1,"Dispensation [comes] from God and His messenger for those associators with whom you have made a treaty"
  9,2,"travel around the earth for four months, and realize that you (all) cannot escape from God. God will shame disbelievers"
  9,3,"[This is] a proclamation by God and His messenger for mankind [assembled] on the day of the greater Pilgrimage, to wit: God may dissolve treaty obligations with associators and [so may] His messenger. If you repent, then it will be better for you; while if you turn aside, know that you cannot escape from God. Announce painful torment to those who disbelieve"
  9,4,"except for those associators with whom you have already made a treaty; provided they have not failed you in any respect nor backed up anyone against you. Fulfill any treaty [you have] with them until their period is up. God loves those who do their duty"
  9,5,"When the hallowed months have slipped away, then fight associators wherever you may find them; take them and besiege them, and waylay them at every outpost. If they should repent, keep up prayer and pay the welfare tax, then let them go their way. God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  9,6,"If one of the associators should ask you for protection, then grant him asylum until he has heard God´s word. Later on escort him to where he can find safety. That is because they are folk who do not know anything"
