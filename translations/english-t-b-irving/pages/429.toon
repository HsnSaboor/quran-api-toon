  34,8,"Has he invented a lie about God or has he some sprite within him?\" Rather the ones who do not believe in the Hereafter will be in torment and extreme error"
  34,9,"Have they not considered whatever lies before them from the sky and earth, and what is behind them? If We wished, We would let the earth swallow them up or a patch of sky drop down on them. In that is a sign for every penitent servant"
  34,10,"We gave David bounty from Ourself: \"O mountains, echo back [God´s praises] along with him! And [so may] the birds.\" We softened iron for him"
  34,11,"Make suits of armor and measure out the links in mail, and act honorably; I am Observant of anything you do"

  34,13,"They worked away for him just as he wished on shrines and images, bowls as big as troughs and built-in cauldrons: \"Give thanks, 0 House of David!\" Yet few of My servants are grateful"
  34,14,"When We determined he should die, nothing indicated his death to them except a worm from the earth which was eating away at his cane. When he fell down, the sprites realized clearly that if they had known the Unseen, they would not have had to continue in such humiliating torment"
