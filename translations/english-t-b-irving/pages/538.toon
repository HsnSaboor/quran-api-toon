quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  57,4,"He is the One Who created Heaven and Earth in six days; then He mounted on the Throne. He knows what penetrates the earth and what issues from it, and what comes down from the sky and what soars up into it. He is with you (all) wherever you may be! God is Observant of anything you do"
  57,5,He holds control over Heaven and Earth; unto God do matters return
  57,6,He wraps night up in daytime; and wraps daytime up in night. He is Aware of whatever is on our minds
  57,7,"Believe in God and His messenger, and spend something out of whatever He has let you inherit [from anyone else]. Those of you who believe and spend [on charity and in public service] will have an even larger fee"
  57,8,"What is wrong with you that you do not believe in God and the Messenger? He invites you (all) to believe in your Lord; He has made an agreement with you, provided you are believers"
  57,9,"He is the One Who has sent down clear signs upon His servant, so he may lead you out of darkness into Light. God is so Gentle, Merciful with you"
  57,10,"What is wrong with you that you do not spend anything for God´s sake? God holds the heritage of Heaven and Earth. Those among you who have spent and fought before the victory are not equal: those stand higher in rank than the ones who spent and fought later on. God has promised each one the very finest. God is Informed about whatever you do"
  57,11,"Who is the one who will advance God a handsome loan? He will double it for him so he [will receive] a generous fee"
