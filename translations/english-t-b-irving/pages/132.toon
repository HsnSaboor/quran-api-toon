quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,36,"Only those who listen will respond, plus the dead whom God will raise; then unto Him will they return"
  6,37,"They say: \"If a sign were only sent down to him by his Lord!\" SAY: \"God is Able to send down a sign, even though most of them will not know it"
  6,38,"There is no animal [walking] on earth nor any bird flying on its wings unless they exist as communities like yourselves. We have not neglected anything in the Book; then to their Lord will they be summoned"
  6,39,"Those who reject Our signs are deaf and dumb, [groping along] in darkness. God lets anyone He wishes go astray, while He sets anyone He wishes upon a Straight Road"
  6,40,"SAY: ´Have you considered whether, once God´s torment comes to you (all) or the Hour comes to you, you will appeal to someone instead of God if you are so truthful"
  6,41,"Rather it is to Him you will appeal and if He wishes, He will remove whatever you have appealed to Him about, and you will forget what you have associated [with Him]"
  6,42,"We sent [word] to nations before you and seized them with suffering and hardship so that they might act submissively"
  6,43,"Why then did they not act submissive when Our violence came to them, but instead their hearts were hardened and Satan made whatever they were doing seem attractive to them"
  6,44,"So once they forgot what they had been reminded of, We opened up the doors to everything for them until just when they were happiest with what they had been given, We caught them suddenly and there they were confounded"
