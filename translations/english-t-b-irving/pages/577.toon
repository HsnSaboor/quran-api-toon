quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,No intercession by any mediators will benefit them
  74,49,"What is wrong with them that they avoid remembering [God]"
  74,50,as if they were startled donkeys
  74,51,who have just fled from a lioness
  74,52,Yet every last man among them wants to be handed scriptures all spread out
  74,53,"Of course, it is rather because they do not fear the Here- after"
  74,54,"Indeed, it is a Reminder"
  74,55,"so let anyone who wishes to, remember it"
  74,56,"Yet they will not remember except however God may wish. He is Entitled to be heeded, as well as entitled to grant forgiveness"
  75,1,I do swear by Resurrection Day
  75,2,as I swear by the rebuking soul
  75,3,"does man reckon We shall never gather his bones together [again]"
  75,4,Of course We are Capable of reshaping even his fingertips
  75,5,Yet man wants to carouse right out in the open
  75,6,"He asks: \"When will Resurrection Day be"
  75,7,When one´s sight is dazzled
  75,8,and the moon is eclipsed
  75,9,as the sun and moon are brought together
  75,10,"on that day (every)man will say: Where is there any escape"
  75,11,Of course there will be no sanctuary
  75,12,recourse will be only with your Lord on that day
  75,13,Man will be notified that day about anything he has sent on ahead or else held back
  75,14,Indeed man holds evidence even against himself
  75,15,although he may proffer his excuses
  75,16,Do not try to hurry it up with your tongue
  75,17,"it is up to Us to collect it, as well as [to know how] to recite it"
  75,18,"So whenever We do read it, follow in its reading"
  75,19,it is then We Who must explain it
