quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  12,31,"When she heard about their remarks, she sent for them and prepared a party for them. To each of them she gave a knife. She told [him]: \"Come out to [see] them!\" When they saw him, they praised him and cut their hands. They said: \"God forbid! This is no human being; this is simply a noble angel!´"
  12,32,"She said: \"Well this is the person whom you blamed me for. Yes, I wanted to seduce him, and he held himself back! If he doesn´t do what I order him to, he´ll be jailed, and taken down a notch or two"
  12,33,"He said: \"My Lord, jail is more precious to me than what they are inviting me to do. Unless You ward off their tricks from me, I´ll fall for them and act as if I do not know a thing"
  12,34,"His Lord responded to his plea and warded off their tricks from him. He is the Alert, Aware"
  12,35,Then it occurred to them to jail him for a while even after they had seen the signs
  12,36,"Two young men entered the prison along with him. One of the said: \"I dreamed I was pressing wine.\" The other said: \"I dreamed I was carrying bread on my head from which the birds were eating. Tell us about their interpretation; we see you are someone who acts kindly"
  12,37,"He said: \"Food will not be brought either of you to sustain you, unless I will tell you their interpretation even before it reaches you. That is something my Lord has taught me. I have left the sect of folk who do not believe in God and are disbelievers in the Hereafter"
