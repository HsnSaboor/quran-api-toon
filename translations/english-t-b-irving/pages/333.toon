  22,6,"That [comes about] because God is the Truth: He revives the dead and is Capable of everything"
  22,7,"The Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it. God will raise up whoever are in [their] graves"
  22,8,"Yet some men argue about God without having any knowledge or guidance, nor any enlightening Book"

  22,10,"That is because of what your hands have sent on ahead.\" Yet God is no One to harm [His] worshippers"
