quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,75,"Why should you not fight for God´s sake when men, women and children who are considered helpless say: \"Our Lord, lead us out of this town whose people are so oppressive, and grant us a patron from Your presence and grant us a supporter from Your presence"
  4,76,"Those who believe, fight in God´s way, while those who disbelieve fight in the way of the arrogant ones; therefore fight Satan´s patrons. Satan´s plot is weak"
  4,77,"Have you not watched those who have been told: \"Restrain your hands, keep up prayer and pay the welfare tax\"? Yet whenever any fighting is prescribed for them, then a group of them feel afraid of people just as they should be afraid of God, or they are even more afraid. They say: \"Our Lord, why have You prescribed fighting for us? If You would only postpone it for a little while longer!\" * SAY: \"Worldly enjoyment means little while the Hereafter is better for anyone who does his duty. You will not be wronged a bit"
  4,78,"Wherever you may be, death shall still overtake you even though you are in well-built towers.\" Yet if something fine happens to them, they say: \"This is from God;\" while if something bad happens to them, they say: \"This is because of you!\" SAY: \"Everything comes from God.\" What is wrong with such folk that they scarcely understand why anything happens"
  4,79,"Any good that happens to you comes from God, while anything bad that happens to you is through yourself. We have sent you as a Messenger to [instruct] mankind; and God suffices as a Witness"
