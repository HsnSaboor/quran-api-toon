quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,13,"Or do they say: \"He has made it all up!\" SAY: ´Well then bring chapters made up like it! Appeal to anyone you can manage to instead of to God if you are so truthful"
  11,14,"If they do not respond to you, then know it has only been sent down with God´s knowledge. There is no deity except Him. Will you not become Muslims"
  11,15,We shall repay anyone who has been wanting worldly life and its attraction according to their actions in it; they will not be caught short there
  11,16,"Yet those will have only the Fire during the Hereafter anything they have been producing in it will collapse and whatever they have been doing will [prove to] be useless"
  11,17,"What about someone who has [received] an explanation from his Lord and to whom a witness from Him is reciting while Moses´ book lies before him as a token and a mercy? Such persons believe in it. Anyone from the factions who disbelieve in it will have the Fire for his appointment, so do not be in any quandary about it; it is the Truth from your Lord, even though most men do not believe so"
  11,18,"Who is more in the wrong than someone who invents a lie about God? Those will be turned over to their Lord and witnesses will say: \"These are the ones who have lied about their Lord!\" Does not God´s curse rest on wrongdoers"
  11,19,"those who obstruct God´s way and attempt to make it crooked, and are disbelievers in the Hereafter"
