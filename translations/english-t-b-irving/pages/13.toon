quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,84,"So We made an agreement with you: \"You must not shed your own blood, nor drive one another out of your homes;\" then you ratified this and were witnesses [for it]"
  2,85,"Then there you go killing one another and driving a group of you from their homes, backing one another up against them out of sin and enmity. If they are brought to you as prisoners, you ransom them, while it has been forbidden for you even to expel them! Do you believe in part of the Book and disbelieve in another part of it? What reward has anyone of you who does so, except disgrace during worldly life, while on Resurrection Day they will be driven off to the harshest torment? God does not overlook anything you do"

  2,87,"We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with messengers later on. We gave Jesus the son of Mary evidence and assisted him with the Holy Spirit. Yet every time some messenger comes to you with what you yourselves do not fancy, why do you act so overbearing? One group you have rejected while another group you would [like to] kill"
  2,88,"They said: \"Our hearts are covered over.\" Rather God has cursed them because of their disbelief; little do they believe"
