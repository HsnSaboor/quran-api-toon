quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,"Some of us are Muslims while others of us are [still] holding back. Those who have committed themselves to (live in) peace are dedicated to integrity"
  72,15,while those who hold back will become kindling for Hell
  72,16,"If they would only keep straight along the highway, We will let them drink plenty of water"
  72,17,so We may test them by means of it; while it will lead anyone away to mounting torment who avoids mentioning his Lord
  72,18,"Mosques belong to God, so do not appeal to anyone besides God (in them)"
  72,19,"Yet whenever God´s servant stood up to appeal to Him, they almost crowded in upon him"
  72,20,"SAY: \"I appeal only to my Lord and never associate anyone else [in my worship of] Him"
  72,21,"SAY: \"I do not control any harm for you nor any integrity"
  72,22,"SAY: \"No one grants protection from God nor will I ever find any sanctuary besides that in Him"
  72,23,"except through a decree from God, and in His message. Anyone who defies God and His messenger will have Hell fire to live in for ever"
  72,24,"until once they see what they have been promised, they will realize who has the weakest supporter and are fewest in numbers"
  72,25,"SAY: \"If I only knew whether what you are promised is near, or whether my Lord has set a grace period for it"
  72,26,"Knowing the Unseen, He never discloses his Unseen [secrets] to anyone"
  72,27,except for some messenger whom He approves of. He leads him off with an escort both before him and behind him
  72,28,"so He may know that they have delivered their Lord´s messages. He embraces anything that lies in their prescnce, and calculates everything by means of numbers"
