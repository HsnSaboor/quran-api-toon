quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"To Him should knowledge about the Hour be referred: no fruit comes forth from its blossom and no female conceives nor gives birth without His knowledge. The day when He calls out to them: \"Where are My associates?\", they will say: \"We assure You there is not a witness [for them] among us"
  41,48,Whatever they were appealing to previously will leave them in the lurch; they will think they have no way to escape
  41,49,"Man never tires of appealing for good, while if some evil ever afflicts him, he becomes desperate, disheartened"
  41,50,"If We let him taste some mercy from Ourself after some hardship has afflicted him, he is sure to say: \"This is mine! I do not think the Hour is at hand. Even if I were sent back to my Lord, I would still [receive] the finest [treatment] from Him!\" We shall notify those who disbelieve about whatever they have done; We will let them taste fierce torment"
  41,51,"Whenever We show man some favor, he spurns it and drifts off to one side. Then when any evil afflicts him, he appeals [to Us] both loud and long"
  41,52,"SAY: \"Have you considered whether it [came] from God? Yet even then you (all) disbelieved in Him!\" Who wanders further off the track than someone who is in extreme disagreement? The Macrocosm and Microcosm"
  41,53,"We will show them Our signs on [all] the horizons as well as within themselves, until it becomes clear to them that it is the Truth. Does your Lord not suffice as a Witness for everything"
  41,54,"Still they [remain] in a quandary about meeting their Lord! Yet He is the One Who embraces everything"
