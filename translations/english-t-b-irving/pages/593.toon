quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the Daybreak
  89,2,and ten nights
  89,3,and the even and the odd
  89,4,and night as it journeys on
  89,5,does that not contain an oath for someone who is mindful
  89,6,Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with Ad
  89,7,"[the people of] Iram, possessing columns"
  89,8,whose like had never been created in the land
  89,9,And Thamud who carved rock out of the valley
  89,10,and Pharaoh wielding kingpins
  89,11,who were (all) so arrogant in the land
  89,12,and increased corruption there
  89,13,Your Lord unleashed the scourge of torment on them
  89,14,Your Lord is ever on the lookout
  89,15,"Yet everyman says, whenever his Lord tests him by honoring and favoring him: \"My Lord has honored me"
  89,16,"while whenever He tests him by rationing His sustenance for him, he says: \"My Lord has disgraced me"
  89,17,Rather you are not generous with the orphan
  89,18,nor do you promote feeding the needy
  89,19,and greedily use up anything you inherit
  89,20,You love money till it´s brimming over
  89,21,Indeed when the earth has been completely flattened out
  89,22,"and your Lord comes with the angels, row upon row"
  89,23,"and brings up Hell on that day; on that day everyman will remember, as if remembrance even matters to him"
