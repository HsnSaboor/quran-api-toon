  37,52,"who used to say: ´Have you become convinced"
  37,53,"When we have, died and become dust and bones, will we he called to account"
  37,54,"He will say: \"Will you (all) just take a look"
  37,55,"So he did look down and saw he was [standing] in the midst of Hades"
  37,56,"He said: \"By God, you have almost ruined me"
  37,57,"If it were not for my Lord´s favor, I´d have been made to appear"
  37,58,Aren´t we mortal
  37,59,except for our first death? Will we not be punished
  37,60,This is the splendid Achievement!´
  37,61,For such as this let workers toil
  37,62,Is that a better welcome or is the Infernal Tree
  37,63,We have placed it as a trial for wrongdoers
  37,64,It is a tree that rises from the depths of Hades
  37,65,"Its cluster [of fruit] looks like devils´ heads"
  37,66,they will eat some of it and fill their stomachs with it
  37,67,"Then on top of it, they will have a concoction made from bathwater [to drink]"

  37,70,and yet they went scurrying along in their footsteps
  37,71,Most primitive men went astray before them
  37,72,even though We had sent warners out among them
  37,73,yet see what the outcome was for those who were warned
  37,74,except for God´s sincere servants
  37,75,"Noah called out to Us, and how favored are those [like him] who respond"
  37,76,We saved him and his family from serious grief
