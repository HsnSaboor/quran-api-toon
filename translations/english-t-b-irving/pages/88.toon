quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,60,Have you not considered those who claim they believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you? They want to seek judgment from arrogant leaders and so they are ordered to disbelieve in it. Satan wants to lead them far astray
  4,61,"Whenever someone tells them: \"Come to what God has sent down, and to the Messenger,\" you will see hypocrites barring the way for you"
  4,62,"How will it be when some disaster strikes them because of what their hands have already prepared? Then they will come to you swearing by God: \"We only wanted to have kindness and success"
  4,63,"Those are the ones whom God knows what their hearts contain, so shun them and reprove them. Give them a convincing statement about themselves"
  4,64,"We have not sent any messenger unless he was to be obeyed in accordance with God´s permission. If they had come to you and sought forgiveness from God whenever they harmed themselves, and the Messenger had prayed for forgiveness for them, they would have found that God is Ever-Turning, Merciful"
  4,65,"Yet by your Lord, they will never believe until they name you to judge concerning what they are quarreling over among themselves; then they will find no inconvenience for themselves concerning whatever you have decided, and will accept it wholeheartedly"
