quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,43,No nation may anticipate its deadline nor will they ever postpone it
  23,44,"Then We sent Our messengers one after another. Each time its messenger came to some nation, they rejected him, so We followed some of them up with others and turned them into conversation pieces. Away with any folk who will not believe"
  23,45,Next We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and clear authority
  23,46,"to Pharaoh and his courtiers, and they acted too proudly and were such haughty folk"
  23,47,"So they said: \"Are we to believe in two human beings like ourselves while their people are slaving for us"
  23,48,"They rejected them both, and so eventually were wiped out"
  23,49,Yet We had given Moses the Book so that they might be guided
  23,50,"We set up the son of Mary and his mother as a sign, and sheltered them both on a hilltop where there was both lodging and a spring"
  23,51,"messengers, eat wholesome things and act honorably; I am Aware of anything you do"
  23,52,"This nation of yours [forms] one community while I am your Lord, so heed me"
  23,53,"Yet they carve up their business into cartels among themselves, each faction happy with whatever lies before them"
  23,54,Leave them in their excitement for a while
  23,55,Do they reckon that We have only afforded them wealth and children because of it
  23,56,"We hurry good things up for them, yet they do not even notice it"
  23,57,Those who feel anxious out of awe for their Lord
  23,58,and those who believe in their Lord´s signs
  23,59,and those who do not associate anything with their Lord
