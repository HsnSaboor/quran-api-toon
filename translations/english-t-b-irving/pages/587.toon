quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When the sky bursts apart
  82,2,when planets are strewn around
  82,3,when the seas spill forth
  82,4,when graves are overturned
  82,5,"[each] soul will know what it sent on ahead and has left behind"
  82,6,"O man, what has lured you away from your generous Lord"
  82,7,"Who created you, fashioned you and proportioned you"
  82,8,in whatever shape He wished? He has put your frame together
  82,9,Nevertheless you still reject religion
  82,10,Yet over you (all) there stand
  82,11,"some noble guardians, writing it all down"
  82,12,they know anything you do
  82,13,The virtuous shall be in bliss
  82,14,while the loose-living will be in Hades
  82,15,they shall roast there on the Day for Repayment
  82,16,they will never be led out of it
  82,17,What will make you realize what the Day for Repayment is
  82,18,"Again, what will make you realize what the Day for Repayment will be like"
  82,19,"[It is] a day when no soul will control anything in favor of any other soul; God [Alone] will hold command on that day"
  83,1,It will be too bad for cheats
  83,2,who insist on receiving everything when they have people measure something out for them
  83,3,"yet whenever they measure or weigh things for others, they give (them) less than their due"
  83,4,Do not such persons suppose they will be raised up again
  83,5,"[to render accounts] on a tremendous day"
  83,6,a day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the Universe
