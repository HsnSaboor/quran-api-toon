quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,40,so that we may follow the sorcerers once they have won out
  26,41,"When the sorcerers came, they said to Pharaoh: \"Will we have payment if we are the winners"
  26,42,"He said: \"Yes, you will then become courtiers"
  26,43,"Moses told them: \"Throw down whatever you are going to throw.´"
  26,44,"So they threw their ropes and their staffs, and said: \" By Pharaoh´s majesty, we will be the winners!\" ´"
  26,45,"So Moses cast his staff and imagine, it swallowed up what they were shamming about"
  26,46,The sorcerers dropped down on their knees
  26,47,"they said: \"We believe in the Lord of the Universe"
  26,48,the Lord of Moses and Aaron
  26,49,"He said. \"Have you believed in Him before I permit you to? He is your chief who has taught you magic. You will know! I´ll cut your hands and feet off on opposite sides and crucify you all"
  26,50,"They said: ´It won´t hurt! We will be sent home to our Lord"
  26,51,we long for our Lord to forgive us our mistakes so we may be the first among believers
  26,52,"We inspired Moses as follows: \"Travel with My servants at night: you will be pursued"
  26,53,Pharaoh sent recruiters into the cities
  26,54,Those are a few dissidents
  26,55,they are agitating against us
  26,56,We are completely forewarned
  26,57,Yet We drove them out of (their) gardens and springs
  26,58,treasures and a splendid position
  26,59,The same We let the Children of Israel fall heirs to
  26,60,They followed after them at sunrise
