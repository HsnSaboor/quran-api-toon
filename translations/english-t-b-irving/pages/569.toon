quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,they will merely give each other a knowing look. A criminal might like to ransom himself from that day´s torment through his children
  70,12,"his wife, a brother of his"
  70,13,his family circle which has sheltered him
  70,14,"and everyone who is on earth if [such action] might then save him"
  70,15,Of course not; it would flare up
  70,16,tugging at his scalp
  70,17,claiming anyone who tries to escape and turns away
  70,18,through saving (things) up and hoarding (them)
  70,19,Man has been created restless
  70,20,so he panics whenever any evil touches him
  70,21,and withdraws when some good touches him
  70,22,except for the prayerful
  70,23,who are constant at their prayers
  70,24,and whose wealth comprises an acknowledged responsibility
  70,25,towards the beggar and the destitute
  70,26,and the ones who accept the Day for Repayment
  70,27,and those who are apprehensive about their Lord´s torment
  70,28,their Lord´s torment is nothing to feel too safe from
  70,29,and the ones who preserve their chastity
  70,30,except with their own spouses or those living under their control; with such they are blameless
  70,31,"Those who desire [to go] beyond that, will be going too far"
  70,32,and the ones who preserve their trusts and oaths
  70,33,and the ones who stand by their testimony
  70,34,and the ones who attend to their prayer
  70,35,those will be honored in gardens
  70,36,"Yet what is wrong with those who disbelieve, that they should try to dash on ahead of you"
  70,37,in batches to the right and on the left
  70,38,Does every man among them aspire to enter the Garden of Bliss
  70,39,Of course not! We created them out of something they well know
