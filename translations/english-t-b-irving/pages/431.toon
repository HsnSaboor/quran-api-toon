quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,23,"Intercession does not benefit anyone so far as He is concerned except for someone He grants it to, until when [panic] is driven from their hearts, they say: \"What did your Lord say?\" They will say: \"The Truth!\" He is the Sublime, the Great"
  34,24,"SAY: \"Who provides for you out of Heaven and Earth?\" SAY: \"God [Alone].\" Are either we or you closer to guidance, or else in obvious error"
  34,25,"SAY: \"You will not be questioned about what we have perpetrated nor shall we be questioned about what you have done"
  34,26,"SAY: \"Our Lord will gather us in together; then things will be opened up in all Truth for us. He is the Opener, the Aware"
  34,27,"SAY: \"Show me the ones you have connected with Him as associates. It cannot be; rather He is God, the Powerful, the Wise"
  34,28,"We have not sent you [Muhammad] except as a newsbearer and warner to every single human being, even though most men do not realize it"
  34,29,"and they say: \"When will this promise be if you (all) have been so truthful"
  34,30,"SAY: \"You hold an appointment for a day which will be neither postponed nor advanced by so much as an hour"
  34,31,"Those who disbelieve say: \"We´ll never believe in this Reading nor in the one which (came] before it.\" If you could only see how, when wrongdoers are stationed before their Lord, they will toss the statement back and forth at one another. Those who had been despised as weaklings will tell those who acted overbearing: \"If it were not for you, we´d be believers"
