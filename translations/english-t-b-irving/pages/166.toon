quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  7,131,"Whenever something fine came to them, they said: \"This is ours;\" while if something evil afflicted them, they took it as an omen connected with Moses and whoever was with him. Did not their omen only lie with God? Yet most of them do not realize it"
  7,132,"They said: \"No matter what sign you may bring us to charm us with, we will never believe in you"
  7,133,"We sent the flood and grasshoppers, lice, frogs and blood on them as distinguishing signs, yet they (still) acted proudly and were criminal folk"
  7,134,"Whenever some plague fell upon them, they said: \"Moses, appeal to your Lord for us, because of what He has pledged for you; if you will lift the plague from us, we will believe in you and send the Children of Israel away with you"
  7,135,"Yet whenever We lifted the plague from them for a period which they were to observe, why, they failed to keep it"
  7,136,"We avenged Ourselves on them and drowned them in the deep, because they had rejected Our signs and been so heedless of them"
  7,137,We let a folk whom they considered to be inferior inherit the Eastern and Western parts of the land which We had blessed. Your Lord´s finest word was accomplished for the Children of Israel because they had been so patient. We destroyed everything Pharaoh and his people had been producing and whatever they had been building
