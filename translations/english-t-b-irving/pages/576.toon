quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,Let him think things over and measure them out
  74,19,Yet he still will be damned just as he has measured
  74,20,"once again, he will be killed just as he has measured things out"
  74,21,Then he looked
  74,22,next he frowned and scowled
  74,23,"then he stepped back, glanced around haughtily"
  74,24,"and said: \"This is just some magic which has been handed down"
  74,25,this is merely a statement made by some human being
  74,26,I´ll roast him by scorching
  74,27,What will make you realize what scorching is
  74,28,It spares nothing nor leaves anything over
  74,29,"as it shrivels human [flesh]"
  74,30,Over it there are Nineteen
  74,31,"We have placed none but angels as guardians of the Fire. We have placed such a number merely as a test for those who disbelieve, to convince the ones who have been given the Book, while those who believe may be increased in [their] faith; and so the ones who have been given the Book as well as believers may not doubt, while the ones in whose hearts there lurks mahce, as well as disbelievers will say: \"What does God want to compare this to ?\" Thus God lets anyone He wishes go astray while He guides whomever He wishes. No one knows your Lord´s armies except He Himself. It is only a Reminder for humanity"
  74,32,Indeed not; by the moon
  74,33,and night as it retreats
  74,34,and morning when it shines forth
  74,35,"it is one of the greatest [signs]"
  74,36,"[given] as a waming for humanity"
  74,37,for anyone of you who wishes to advance or lag behind
  74,38,"Each soul is [held] as a pledge for anything he has earned"
  74,39,except for the companions on the Right
  74,40,who will be in gardens enquiring
  74,41,about the criminals
  74,42,Whatever induced you to be scorched
  74,43,"They will say: \"We were not among the prayerful"
  74,44,nor did we feed the needy
  74,45,We speculated along with the speculators
  74,46,"and kept denying [about appearing on] the Day for Repayment"
  74,47,"until [its] certainty came home to us"
