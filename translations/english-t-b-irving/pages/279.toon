quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,103,"We already know they are saying: \"It is merely a human being who is teaching him!\" The tongue of the person whom they hint at is foreign, while this is clear Arabic speech"
  16,104,"God will never guide those who do not believe in God´s signs, while they will have painful torment"
  16,105,Those who do not believe in God´s signs are merely inventing a lie; such men are liars
  16,106,"Anyone who disbelieves in God after having once made his profession of faith except for someone who is compelled to while his heart is unwavering in its faith-but anyone who lays (his) breast wide open to disbelief will have wrath from God [descend] on him. They have awful torment"
  16,107,That is because they cherish worldly life rather the Hereafter. God does not guide disbelieving folk
  16,108,"Those are the ones whose hearts, hearing and eyesight God has sealed off. Those are the heedless"
  16,109,They will positively be the losers in the Hereafter
  16,110,"Even then your Lord-for those who have migrated after they were persecuted, then struggled and were patient-after such [trials] your Lord will be Forgiving, Merciful"
