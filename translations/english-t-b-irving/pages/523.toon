quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  51,52,"Thus no messenger ever came to those who preceded them unless they said: ´[He´s] a magician or a madman!´"
  51,53,Do they recommend it to one another? Yet they are such arrogant folk
  51,54,Turn away from them; you are not to blame
  51,55,"Remind, for reminding benefits believers"
  51,56,I have only created sprites and men so they may worship Me
  51,57,I do not want any sustenance from them nor do I need them to feed me
  51,58,"God is the Provider, wielding sturdy strength"
  51,59,"The ones who do wrong have offences just like their companions´ offences, so do not let them ask Me to hurry things up"
  51,60,It will be too bad for those who disbelieve on their day which has been promised them
  52,1,By the Mount
  52,2,and a Book recorded
  52,3,on unrolled parchment
  52,4,and the thriving House
  52,5,"with the roof raised [over it]"
  52,6,and the swollen sea
  52,7,your Lord´s torment is bound to happen
  52,8,No one will avert it
  52,9,on a day when the sky will shift about
  52,10,and the mountains travel around
  52,11,It will be too bad on that day for rejectors
  52,12,who play around with speculation
  52,13,on the day they will be pushed firmly towards Hell fire
  52,14,This is the Fire which you have been denying
