quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,The ones who do not believe in the Hereafter call the angels by the names of females
  53,28,Yet they have no knowledge about it; they only follow guesswork. Conjecture will not help out in any way against the Truth
  53,29,"so shun anyone who avoids mentioning Us and only wants [to enjoy] worldly life"
  53,30,"that will be their range of knowledge. Your Lord is quite Aware as to who has strayed from His path, just as He is quite Aware as to who is guided"
  53,31,"God possesses whatever is in Heaven and whatever is on Earth, so He may reward the ones who commit evil according to whatever they have done while He rewards the ones who act kindly with [equal] kindness"
  53,32,"Those who refrain from the greatest vices and sexual offences, except for oversights (will find] your Lord is Boundless when it comes to forgiveness. He was quite Aware of you when He produced you from the earth and when you were still embryos in your mothers´ wombs. Do not try to justify yourselves; He is quite Aware as to who has done his duty"
  53,33,Have you seen someone who turns away
  53,34,"He has given little, and even skimps at that"
  53,35,"Has he such knowledge about the Unseen that he can (actually) see [it]"
  53,36,Or has he not been notified about what was on Moses´ scrolls
  53,37,"and on Abraham´s, who always kept his word"
  53,38,That no burdened soul shall bear another´s burden
  53,39,That everyman receives only what he makes an effort for
  53,40,so his effort shall be noticed
  53,41,then he will be rewarded to the fullest extent
  53,42,And that towards your Lord lies the final End
  53,43,and He makes (us) both laugh and cry
  53,44,He brings death and grants life
