quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  6,91,"They do not value God the way He should be valued when they say: ´God has not sent down anything to a human being.\" SAY: \"Who sent down the Book which Moses came with, as Light and guidance for mankind? You publish it on (separate) sheets to show it around, while you (also) hide a great deal [of it]. You have been taught what neither you yourselves nor your forefathers ever knew.\" SAY: \"God [has sent it];\" then leave them toying away with their speculation"
  6,92,"This is a blessed Book We have sent down to confirm whatever came before it, so you may warn the Mother of Towns and anyone around her. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it and attend to their prayer"
  6,93,"Yet who is more in the wrong than someone who invents a lie about God? Or says: \"Something has been revealed to me... \", while nothing has been revealed to him; and who says: \"I shall send down the same as God has sent down\"? If you could only see when wrongdoers are in their death throes and the angels stretch forth their hands: \"Away with your souls! Today you are awarded the torment of shame because you have been saying something that is not true about God. You have acted too proud for His signs"
  6,94,"You have (all) come to Us individually, now, just as We created you in the first place. You have left behind what We conferred on you, nor do We see your intercessors alongside you whom you claimed were associated with you. They have been cut off from you, and what you have been claiming has merely led you astray"
