quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,78,"A group of them twist their tongues around concerning the Book so you will reckon [something] comes from the Book while it is not from the Book. They say: \"It comes from God!\", while it is not from God. They knowingly tell a lie about God"
  3,79,"It is not proper for God to give the Book plus discretion and prophethood to any human being, then that [the latter] should tell people: ´Be worshippers of mine instead of God´s,\" but rather: ´Be the Lord´s [Alone] since you have been teaching the Book and because you have been studying it"
  3,80,He does not order you to adopt angels and prophets as lords; would He order you to disbelieve once you have become Muslims
  3,81,"So God accepted an agreement from the prophets: \"Have I not given you some of a Book plus wisdom?\" Then a messenger came to you to confirm what you already had, so you might believe in him and support him. He said: \"Have you acknowledged and accepted that obligation of mine?\" They said: ´We so acknowledge it.\" He said: \"Then act as witnesses; I am one of those testifying along with you"
  3,82,Those who turn away later on act immorally
  3,83,"Do they crave something besides God´s religion? Whoever is in Heaven and Earth is committed to [make] peace with Him, whether willingly or reluctantly; to Him will they be returned"
