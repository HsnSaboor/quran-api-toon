quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  55,68,"Both will have fruit, datepalms and pomegranates"
  55,69,so which of your Lord´s benefits will both of you deny
  55,70,"In them there will be the best, the fairest women"
  55,71,So which of your Lord´s benefits will both of you deny
  55,72,Bright-eyed damsels sheltered in pavilions
  55,73,so which of your Lord´s benefits will both of you deny
  55,74,"Whom no human being has tainted previously, nor any sprites"
  55,75,So which of your Lord´s benefits will both of you deny
  55,76,They will lean back on green cushions and handsome carpets
  55,77,so which of your Lord´s benefits will both of you deny
  55,78,"Blessed be your Lord´s name, Possessor of Majesty and Splendor"
  56,1,When the Inevitable arrives
  56,2,no one will deny its happening
  56,3,"humbling, exalting"
  56,4,The earth will be rocked with a jolt
  56,5,and the mountains crumble to pieces
  56,6,and become dust that is scattered about
  56,7,You will form three groups
  56,8,"the Companions on the Right (What do the Companions on the Right [mean)"
  56,9,"the Companions on the Left (What do the Companions on the Unlucky side [mean)"
  56,10,and the Pioneers will be out there leading
  56,11,Those will be the nearest
  56,12,in gardens of bliss
  56,13,a multitude from early men
  56,14,and a few from later ones
  56,15,on couches set close together
  56,16,"leaning back on them, facing one another"
