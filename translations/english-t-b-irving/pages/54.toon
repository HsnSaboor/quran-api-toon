quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,30,"Some day when every person will find whatever good he has done is presented [as evidence] as well as whatever bad he has done, he would like a long stretch [to lie] between them and himself. God cautions you about Himself-, though God is Gentle with [His] worshippers"
  3,31,"SAY: \"If you have been loving God, then follow me; God will then love you and forgive you your offences. God is Forgiving, Merciful!´"
  3,32,"SAY: \"Obey God and the Messenger.\" Yet if they should turn away, [remember that] God does not love disbelievers"
  3,33,"God selected Adam and Noah, Abraham´s House and Imran´s House over [everyone in] the Universe"
  3,34,"Some of their offspring are descended from others. God is Alert, Aware"
  3,35,"Thus a woman [from the House] of Imran said: \"My Lord, I have freely consecrated whatever is in my womb to You. Accept it from me; You are Alert, Aware"
  3,36,"When she gave birth, she said: \"My Lord, I have given birth to a daughter.\"-(God was quite Aware of what she had given birth to, for a male is not like a female)-\"I have named her Mary, and ask You to protect her and her offspring ´from Satan the Outcast"
  3,37,"Her Lord accepted her in a handsome manner and caused her to grow like a lovely plant, and told Zachariah to take care of her. Every time Zachariah entered the shrine to [see] her, he found she had already been supplied with food. He said: \"Mary, how can this be meant for you?\" She said: \"It comes from God, for God provides for anyone He wishes without any reckoning"
