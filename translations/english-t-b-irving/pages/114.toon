quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,37,"They may want to leave the Fire, yet they will not leave it; theirs will be constant torment"
  5,38,"A thief, whether a man or a woman, shall have his or her hands cut off as a penalty for whatever he or she has earned, as an example set by God. God is Powerful, Wise"
  5,39,"God will relent towards anyone who repents following his wrongdoing, and reforms; God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  5,40,Do you not know that God holds control over Heaven and Earth? He punishes anyone He wants to and forgives anyone He wants. God is Capable of everything
  5,41,"Messenger, do not let those who rush off into disbelief worry you, such as those who say: \"We believe\" with their mouths, while their hearts do not believe. Some of those are Jews who are listening for [the sake of] lying, listening for other folk who do not come to you. They lift words out of their context, saying: \"If you are given this, then take it; while if you are not given it, then watch out!\" God will never let you control someone whom God wants to test in any way; those are the ones whose hearts God does not want to purify. They will have disgrace in this world, while in the Hereafter they will have terrible punishment"
