quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  48,16,"Tell those desert Arabs who have held back: \"You will be called upon to fight against a folk who are extremely violent; you will fight them unless they surrender. If you obey, God will pay you a handsome fee, while if you turn away just as you turned away before, He will punish you with painful torment"
  48,17,"There is no objection for the blind nor is there any objection for the lame, nor any objection for the sick [if they do not fight]. He will show anyone who obeys God and His messenger into gardens through which rivers flow, while He will punish anyone who turns away with painful torment"
  48,18,"God was pleased with believers as they swore allegiance to you under the tree. He recognized what was in their hearts and sent down Serenity upon them, and compensated them with a nearby victory"
  48,19,"as well as many prizes they still may take. God is Powerful, Wise"
  48,20,God has promised you will take many prizes; he furnished these promptly for you and fended men´s hands off from you so it might serve as a sign for believers and guide you along a Straight Road
  48,21,God has already included other things you do not yet have in your possession. God is Capable of everything
  48,22,"If those who disbelieve should ever fight you, they will still turn their backs [and run away]; then they will not find any patron nor supporter"
  48,23,according to God´s practice which has occurred before. You will never rind any change in God´s practice
