quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Your Lord knows how you stay up close to two thirds of the night [in prayer], half of it, and even a third of it; and [so do) a group of those who are with you. God measures out both night and daylight; He knows that you (all) will never count them up, so He has relented towards you. Read whatever seems feasible from the Quran. He knows that some of you may be ill while others are out travelling around the earth seeking God´s bounty, and still others are fighting for God´s sake. So read any of it that seems feasible, and keep up prayer and pay the welfare tax, and advance God a handsome loan. Anything good you send on ahead for yourselves, you will find [later on] with God; it is better and more important as earnings. Seek forgiveness from God; God will be Forgiving, Merciful"
  74,1,You who are wrapped in a cloak
  74,2,stand up and warn
  74,3,Magnify your Lord
  74,4,purify your clothing
  74,5,and steer clear of filth
  74,6,Do not give so much away that you must ask for more
  74,7,act patiently towards your Lord! The Last Trumpet
  74,8,When the bugle is sounded on that day
  74,9,it will be such a harsh day
  74,10,anything but easy on disbelievers
  74,11,Leave Me Alone with anyone I have created to be lonely
  74,12,to whom I have granted ample wealth
  74,13,and some standing before him
  74,14,and for whom I have smoothed things over
  74,15,"Still he aspires for Me to add even more [to it]"
  74,16,Of course not; he has acted stubbornly towards Our signs
  74,17,I shall weigh him down with mounting trouble
