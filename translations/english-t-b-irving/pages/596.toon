quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,Only the most wretched will roast in it
  92,16,"the one who rejects [the Message] and turns away"
  92,17,while the most heedful will keep away from it
  92,18,the one who gives his money away and (thereby) purifies himself
  92,19,No one is awarded any favor by Him
  92,20,"except through seeking the countenance of his Lord, the All-Highest"
  92,21,"[Such a man] shall meet approval"
  93,1,By the morning bright
  93,2,and at night when all is still
  93,3,your Lord has not forsaken you nor is He annoyed
  93,4,"The Hereafter will be even better for you than the first [life] was"
  93,5,Your Lord will soon give you something which will leave you satisfied
  93,6,"Did He not find you an orphan and sheltered [you]"
  93,7,"He found you lost and guided [you]"
  93,8,He found you destitute and made you rich
  93,9,Thus the orphan must not be exploited
  93,10,and the beggar should not be brushed aside
  93,11,Still tell about your Lord´s favor
  94,1,Did We not relieve your breast for you
  94,2,and remove your burden from you
  94,3,that pressed down upon your back
  94,4,We have even raised up renown of you
  94,5,Yet hardship will bring ease
  94,6,"Indeed, hardship must bring ease"
  94,7,"So whenever you have finished, still toil on"
  94,8,Towards your Lord direct your longing
