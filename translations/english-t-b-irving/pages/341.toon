quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  22,73,"mankind, a parable has been composed, so listen to it! Those whom you appeal to other than to God will never create a fly, even though they combined together to do so. Yet if the fly should snatch anything away from them, they would not even know how to recover it from it. How weak the seeker is, and anything he seeks"
  22,74,"They cannot measure God according to His true power. God is Strong, Powerful"
  22,75,"God selects messengers from both angels and from mankind; God is Alert, Observant"
  22,76,He knows what lies in front of them and what stands behind them; to God do (all) matters return
  22,77,"You who believe, bow down and kneel before [Him], and worship your Lord; and do good, so that you may succeed"
  22,78,"Strive for God´ sake, the way He should be striven for. He has picked you out and has not placed any constraint upon you concerning [your] religion, the sect of your forefather Abraham. He has named you Muslims both previously and right now, so the Messenger may be a witness for you, and you may act as witnesses for mankind. Keep up prayer and pay the welfare tax, and cling firmly to God; He is your Protector. What a splendid Protector, and what a splendid Supporter"
