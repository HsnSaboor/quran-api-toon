quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,71,"People of the Book, why do you dress Truth up with falsehood and knowingly conceal the Truth"
  3,72,"A faction from among the People of the Book say: \"Believe in what has been sent down to those who believe,\" at the outset of the day; towards the end of it, [they say]: \"Disbelieve\". That may be so they will keep coming back [to argue with you]"
  3,73,"Believe only in someone who follows your own religion. SAY: \"Guidance [means] guidance from God, lest one person should he given the same as what you (all) have been given, or they should argue with you concerning your Lord.\" SAY: \"Bounty [rests] in God´s hand. He gives it to anyone He wishes; God is Boundless, Aware"
  3,74,He claims anyone He wishes for His mercy; God possesses tremendous Bounty
  3,75,"If you entrusted some People of the Book with a large sum, he would hand it back to you; while if you entrusted another with a gold coin, he would never hand it back to you unless you dunned him for it constantly. That is because they say: \"There is no way for such illiterates [to complain] against us.\" They tell a lie about God while they realize it"
  3,76,"Instead, anyone who keeps his word and performs his duty [will find] God loves the heedful"
  3,77,"Those who barter God´s pledge plus their [own] faith for a paltry price will have no share in the Hereafter, nor will God ever speak to them nor ever notice them on Resurrection Day. He will not purify them while they will have painful torment"
