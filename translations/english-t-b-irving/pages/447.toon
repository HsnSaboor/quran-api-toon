quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,25,What´s wrong with you that you do not support each other
  37,26,Rather today they are surrendering
  37,27,Some of them will step forth to question one another
  37,28,"They will say: \"You used to come at us from the right"
  37,29,"They will say: \"Rather, you were not believers"
  37,30,We have no authority over you. Instead you have been such arrogant folk
  37,31,Our Lord´s sentence has been confirmed against us; we are indeed tasting it
  37,32,"We lured you on, we were seducers"
  37,33,They will become partners in torment on that day
  37,34,Thus We deal with criminals
  37,35,"They have acted so proudly whenever: \"There is no deity except God [Alone]\" was said to them"
  37,36,"and they were saying: ´Should we abandon our gods for a crazy poet"
  37,37,Rather he has brought the Truth and vouches for the emissaries
  37,38,Yet you will taste painful torment
  37,39,and only be rewarded for what you have been doing
  37,40,except for God´s sincere servants
  37,41,Those will have an acknowledged provision
  37,42,"of fruit, and will be honored"
  37,43,in gardens of Bliss
  37,44,facing one another on couches
  37,45,A cup will he passed around for them from a clear spring
  37,46,"[which will be] delicious for anyone who drinks from it"
  37,47,There will be no hangover from it nor will they feel exhausted by it
  37,48,With them will be bashful women whose eyes still sparkle
  37,49,"as if they were hidden [like hatching] eggs"
  37,50,Some of them will step forward to question one another
  37,51,"Someone among them will speak up and say: \"Once there was a soulmate of mine"
