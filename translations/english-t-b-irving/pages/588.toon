quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,"Indeed not, the loose-livers´ book will be [kept] in a vault"
  83,8,What will make you realize what such a dungeon is like
  83,9,An annotated book
  83,10,It will be too bad for rejectors on that day
  83,11,those who deny the Day for Repayment
  83,12,Each vicious transgressor will plainly reject it
  83,13,"when Our signs are recited to him, he will say: \"[These are] legends by primitive men"
  83,14,Of course not; rather whatever they used to do lies like rust on their hearts
  83,15,Indeed they will be screened off from their Lord on that day
  83,16,next they will roast in Hades
  83,17,"Then someone will say: \"This is what you have been rejecting"
  83,18,"Of course the book for the virtuous will rest in the Highest [Heavens]"
  83,19,"What will make you realize what the Highest [Heavens] are"
  83,20,An annotated book
  83,21,"which those closest [to God] will bear witness to"
  83,22,"The virtuous will [dwell] in Bliss"
  83,23,on couches watching
  83,24,You will recognize a blissful splendor on their faces
  83,25,They will be offered a scaled potion to drink
  83,26,whose seal will be musk. For that let rivals compete
  83,27,It will be blended with a beverage
  83,28,"from a spring where those close [to God] will drink"
  83,29,Those who commit crimes used to laugh at those who believe
  83,30,"Whenever they pass by them, they nod to one another"
  83,31,"Then when they go back to their own people, they return exultant"
  83,32,"Whenever they see them, they say: \"Those (men) are far astray"
  83,33,They have not been sent as overseers (to be) set up over them
  83,34,so today those who believe will laugh at disbelievers
