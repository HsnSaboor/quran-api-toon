quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,98,"If only there had been a town which believed and whose faith had benefited it besides Jonah´s people. Once they believed, We lifted the torment of shame from them during worldly life and let them enjoy things for a while"
  10,99,"If your Lord had so wished, everyone on earth would have believed, all of them together! So will you force mankind to become believers"
  10,100,"It is not up to any soul to believe unless it [happens] with God´s permission; He places a blight on those who do not use their reason"
  10,101,"SAY: \"Look at whatever [exists] in Heaven and Earth. Signs and warning do not benefit any people who do not believe"
  10,102,"Do they expect anything except days like the ones which happened to those who passed away before them? SAY: \"So wait; I am one of those waiting alongside you.´"
  10,103,Then We will save Our messengers and those who believe; it is thus right for Us to save believers
  10,104,"SAY: \"Mankind, if you are in any doubt concerning my religion, well, I do not serve those whom you serve instead of God but rather I worship God [Alone], Who will gather you (all) in. I am commanded to be a believer"
  10,105,"Keep your face set towards religion, seeking [God] righteously and do not be an associator"
  10,106,"nor appeal to something that will neither benefit nor harm you, instead of to God [Alone]. If you should do so, you would then be a wrongdoer"
