quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,when his Lord called to him by the sacred valley of Tuwa
  79,17,Go off to Pharaoh; he has acted arrogantly
  79,18,"SAY: ´Would you care to be purified"
  79,19,"and for me to guide you to your Lord so you may [learn to] dread [Him]?\"´"
  79,20,He showed him the greatest sign
  79,21,Yet he denied and defied it
  79,22,then he turned away to try his best
  79,23,"He summoned, and called out"
  79,24,"and said: \"I am your supreme Lord"
  79,25,"God seized him as an example in (both) the Hereafter and from the First [life]"
  79,26,"In that there lies a lesson for anyone who dreads [retribution]"
  79,27,"Were you harder to create, or the sky He has raised"
  79,28,He has lifted its canopy up and smoothed it off
  79,29,He darkens its night and brings forth its morning glow
  79,30,and the earth has He spread out besides
  79,31,and produced its water and its pasturage from it
  79,32,The mountains has He anchored
  79,33,as an enjoyment for you and for your livestock
  79,34,When the greatest calamity comes along
  79,35,on the day when everyman will remember whatever he has tried to accomplish
  79,36,and Hades will loom forth for anyone to see
  79,37,anyone who has acted arrogantly
  79,38,and preferred worldly life
  79,39,will have Hades for a dwelling place
  79,40,Anyone who has been afraid to stand before his Lord and restrained himself from passion
  79,41,will have the Garden for a dwelling place
  79,42,"They will ask you about the Hour: \"When will it come to pass"
  79,43,Why are you reminding us about it
  79,44,It lies up to your Lord to set it
  79,45,You are merely a warner for anyone who dreads it
  79,46,"just as some day they shall see they have hung around for only an evening, or its morning glow"
