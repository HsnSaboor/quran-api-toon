quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,181,"God has heard the statement of those who say: \"God is poor while we are rich!\" We will write down whatever they say and how they killed the prophets without any right to [do so]. We will say: \"Taste the torment of burning"
  3,182,"That [has happened] because of what your hands sent on ahead. God is no One to harm [His] worshippers"
  3,183,"such as those who say: \"God has charged us not to believe in any messenger until He brings us some offering which fire will consume.\" SAY: \"Messengers before me have already brought you explanations and just what you have said; why did you kill them if you are so truthful"
  3,184,"If they reject you, messengers before you have already been rejected when they came even with explanations, the Psalms and the Enlightening Book"
  3,185,"Every soul will be tasting death: you will merely be repaid your earnings on Resurrection Day. Anyone who is snatched from the Fire and shown into the Garden will have triumphed. What does worldly life mean except the enjoyment of illusion"
  3,186,"You will be tested by means of your wealth and through your own selves, and you will hear much abuse from those who were given the Book before you, as well as those who associate [others with God]. If you are patient and do your duty, that is what will determine matters"
