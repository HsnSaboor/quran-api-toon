quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,87,They are so pleased to be among the stay-behinds. It is stamped on their hearts so they do not understand
  9,88,"but the Messenger and those who believe along with him, do struggle with their property and persons. Those will have even better things; such will be successful"
  9,89,God has prepared gardens through which rivers will flow for them to live in forever; that will be the supreme Achievement
  9,90,Excuse-makers have come from the desert Arabs to beg off for them. Those who tell lies before God and His messenger have merely sat around (at home). Painful torment will afflict those of them who disbelieve
  9,91,"Yet it will not be held against the helpless nor the sick, nor those who cannot find anything to spend [on God´s cause], provided they act sincerely towards God and His messenger; there is no way [open] against those who act kindly since God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  9,92,"Nor [will it be held] against those whom you told, when they came for you to transport them: \"I do not find any means of transporting you.\" They turned away, and their eyes were welling up with tears from sadness since they could not find any way to provide for their expenses"
  9,93,"A way is [open] only against those who beg you to exempt them while they are rich; they are satisfied to be [numbered] among those who stay behind. God has placed a stamp on their hearts while they do not realize it"
