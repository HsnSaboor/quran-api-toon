quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,Indeed how you (all) love the fleeting present
  75,21,while you neglect the Hereafter
  75,22,Some faces will be radiant on that day
  75,23,looking toward their Lord
  75,24,while other faces will be scowling on that day
  75,25,thinking that some impoverishing blow will be dealt them
  75,26,Indeed when it reaches as high as one´s collarbone
  75,27,"and someone says: \"Who is such a wizard"
  75,28,he will suppose that it means leave-taking
  75,29,"while one shin will twist around the other shin [to keep it from moving]"
  75,30,towards your Lord will the Drive be on that day
  75,31,He was not trusting and did not pray
  75,32,"but said: \"No!\" and turned away"
  75,33,Then he stalked off haughtily to his family
  75,34,"[though] closer to you and even closer"
  75,35,"Then closer to you [lies your doom] and still closer"
  75,36,Does man reckon he´ll be left forlorn
  75,37,Was he not once a drop of ejected semen
  75,38,"Then he became a clot, so [God] created and fashioned [him]"
  75,39,"and made him into two sexes, male and female"
  75,40,Is such a Being not Able to revive the dead
  76,1,"Has a period in [this) age not come over (every) man when he was nothing worth mentioning"
  76,2,"We have created man from a drop of semen [forming] cells so We might test him; thus We made him alert, observant"
  76,3,"We have guided him along the [right] path, whether he is thankful or thankless"
  76,4,"We have prepared chains, shackles and a Blaze for disbelievers"
  76,5,The virtuous will drink from a cup which will be mixed with camphor
