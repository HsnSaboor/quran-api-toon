quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,60,and those who give away anything they may give while their hearts feel wary lest they should return to their Lord
  23,61,"[all] those compete in doing good deeds and they will soon attain them"
  23,62,We only assign a soul something it can cope with. Before Us lies a Book which speaks up for Truth; they will not be dealt with unjustly
  23,63,Instead their hearts are full of excitement because of this. They have other deeds besides those which they are committing
  23,64,"so that whenever We seize their high-livers with torment, just imagine how they bellow"
  23,65,"Do not roar [so loud] today; you will not be supported by Us"
  23,66,My signs have already been recited to you while you proudly turned on your heels
  23,67,"away from it, sitting up nights to chatter on and on about it"
  23,68,"Have they not reflected on the Sentence, whether something that never reached their earliest forefathers may not have come to them"
  23,69,Or do they not recognize their Messenger and are disgusted with him
  23,70,"Or do they say: \"Some [mad] sprite possesses him!\"? Rather he has brought them the Truth, while most of them hate the Truth"
  23,71,"If Truth had followed their whims, Heaven and Earth would have collapsed in chaos, along with anyone who is in them. Rather We have brought them their Reminder, yet they keep avoiding their Reminder"
  23,72,"Or are you asking them [to make] some outlay´? Your Lord´s tribute is best, for He is the Best Provider"
  23,73,"You are calling them to [follow] a Straight Road"
  23,74,while those who do not believe in the Hereafter go swerving off the Road
