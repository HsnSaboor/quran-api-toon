quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,26,"Pharaoh said: ´Let me kill Moses! Let him appeal to his Lord! I fear he will change your religion or cause havoc to appear on earth"
  40,27,"Moses said: \"I take refuge with my Lord and your Lord against every overbearing man who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning"
  40,28,"A man from Pharaoh´s court who was a believer and had hiding his faith said: \"What, will you kill a man for merely saying: ´My Lord is God´? He has brought you explanations about your Lord. If he is a liar, then his lie falls upon himself, while if he is truthful, some of what he threatens you with will afflict you. God does not guide anyone who is a preposterous liar"
  40,29,"My folk, you hold control today as masters d earth. Who will support us against God´s might if it should ever come to us?\" Pharaoh said: \"I am only showing you what I see myself, I am only guiding you along the path of normal behavior"
  40,30,"The man who believed said: \"My folk, I fear the same for you as [happened] on the day of the Coalition"
  40,31,"the same as in the case of Noah´s folk, and Ad´s and Thamud´s, as well as those who came after them. God wants no injustice to happen to [His] servants"
  40,32,"My people, I fear the day of the Summons for you"
  40,33,the day when you will (all) turn around to retreat. You will not have any defender against God; anyone whom God lets go astray will have no guide
