quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  8,17,"You (all) do not kill them but God kills them. You did not shoot [anything] when you shot [arrows or spears] but God threw [them] so He may test believers, as a handsome test from Himself. God is Alert, Wise"
  8,18,"That is [how it is]; since God is the One Who will frustrate the disbelievers´ plot"
  8,19,"If you sought to conquer, then victory has already come to you. Yet if you would only stop, it would be better for you; while if you do it over again, We too shall do so again. Your detachment will not give you any advantage no matter how numerous it is. God stands alongside believers"
  8,20,"You who believe, obey God and His messenger; do not turn away from Him while you are within earshot"
  8,21,"Do not be like those who say: \"We have heard,\" while they were not even listening"
  8,22,"The worst animals before God are the deaf and dumb, those who do not use their reason"
  8,23,"If God had known about any good in them, He would have made them hear; yet even though He were to make them hear, they would still turn away and shun [Him]"
  8,24,"You who believe, respond to God and the Messenger whenever He invites you to something that will make you live. Know that God sups in between a man and his heart, and to Him you will (all) be summoned"
  8,25,Do your duty lest dissension strike those of you especially who do wrong. Know that God is Severe in punishment
