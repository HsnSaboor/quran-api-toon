quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,"from couches where they [lie] watching"
  83,36,Are not disbelievers being compensated for just what they have been doing
  84,1,When the sky will split open
  84,2,and listen to its Lord as it ought to
  84,3,suddenly the earth will flatten out
  84,4,"and throw up whatever it contains, and fall back empty"
  84,5,and (also) listen to its Lord as it ought to
  84,6,"Everyman, you are toiling constantly for your Lord, and you will meet Him"
  84,7,Anyone who is given his book in his right hand
  84,8,will be called to account with an easy reckoning
  84,9,and return joyfully to his family
  84,10,while anyone who is given his book behind his back
  84,11,will appeal to be blotted out
  84,12,and will roast in the Blaze
  84,13,He used to be happy with his own people
  84,14,"he supposed he would never revert [to God]"
  84,15,Nevertheless his Lord had still been Observing him
  84,16,So I swear by the gloaming
  84,17,and night and whatever it enshrouds
  84,18,and the moon when it blossoms full
  84,19,you shall ride along stage by stage
  84,20,What is wrong with them that they do not believe
  84,21,"When the Quran is read to them, why do they not bow down on their knees"
  84,22,"Instead, those who disbelieve keep on rejecting"
  84,23,while God is quite Aware of how they are holding back
  84,24,Give them news of painful torment
  84,25,except for those who believe and perform honorable deeds; they will have payment which will never be withheld
