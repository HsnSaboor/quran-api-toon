quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,164,"In the creation of Heaven and Earth, the alternation between night and day, the ships which plow the sea with something to benefit mankind and any water God sends down from the sky with which to revive the following its death, and to scatter every kind of animal throughout it, and directing the winds and clouds which are driven along between the sky and earth, are (all) signs for folk who use their reason"
  2,165,"Yet there are some people who adopt rivals instead of God, whom they love just as they should love God. Those who believe are firmer in their love of God; if only those who commit evil might see, when they face torment, how strength is wholly God´s, and God is Severe with torment"
  2,166,"When those who been following them free themselves from those they have been following and they see the torment, their bonds will be cut off from them"
  2,167,"Those they have been following will say: ´If we only had another chance, then we would free ourselves from them just as they have freed themselves from us!´ Thus God will show them their actions as regrets on their part. They will never leave the Fire"
  2,168,"Mankind, eat anything lawful, wholesome that exists on earth do not follow in Satan´s footsteps; he is an open enemy of yours"
  2,169,"He merely orders you to commit evil and shocking deeds, and to say what you do not know about God"
