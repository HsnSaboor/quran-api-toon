quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  18,5,"They have no knowledge about it, nor did their forefathers have any either. It is too serious a statement to come out of their mouths: they are merely telling a lie"
  18,6,"Perhaps you will fret yourself to death checking up on them, worrying lest they will not believe this report"
  18,7,We have placed whatever is on earth as an ornament for it so We may test them as to which one is best in action
  18,8,and We shall turn anything on it into a barren wasteland
  18,9,Have you considered how the Companions in the Cave and with the Tablet were such marvelous signs of Ours
  18,10,"Thus the youths sought shelter in the Cave, and said: \"Our Lord, grant us mercy from Your presence and furnish us with some direction in our affair"
  18,11,We struck them with drowsiness in the Cave for several years
  18,12,"then We awakened them again so We might know which of the two parties would best calculate how long a stretch they had remained [there]"
  18,13,"We shall relate their story to you correctly: They were young men who believed in their Lord, and We gave them extra guidance"
  18,14,"We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and said: \"Our Lord is Lord of Heaven and Earth. We will never appeal to any deity except Him; should we say [such a thing], then it would be an outrage"
  18,15,"These people of ours have adopted other gods besides Him. If they would only bring some clear authority to support them!\" Who is more in the wrong than someone who invents a lie about God"
