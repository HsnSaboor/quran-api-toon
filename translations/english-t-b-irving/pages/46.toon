quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,270,"God knows any expenses you may have incurred, or any promise you may have sworn. Wrongdoers will have no supporters"
  2,271,"If you publicize any acts of charity, it is quite worthwhile; while if you conceal them and give [directly] to the poor, it will be even better for you, and will cancel out some of your evil deeds for you. God is Informed about anything you do"
  2,272,"Guiding them is not your duty, but God guides anyone He wishes to. Any (tax] money you may spend is for your own good and whatever you spend is only through a craving to see God´s face. Any money you spend will be repaid you, and you will not be harmed"
  2,273,"Take care of the poor who, being totally absorbed in working for God´s cause, cannot manage to travel [freely] around the earth seeking their livelihood. An ignorant person might assume they are rich because of their modesty; yet you will recognize them from their features: they do not make insistent demands on people. Yet God is Aware of any money you may so spend"
  2,274,"Those who spend their wealth night and day, both privately and publicly, will receive their earnings from their Lord. No fear will lie upon them nor need they ever feet saddened"
