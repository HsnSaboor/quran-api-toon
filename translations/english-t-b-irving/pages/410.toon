quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"Even if We sent a wind so they might see it turning things yellow, they would still keep on disbelieving even after it"
  30,52,"You cannot make the dead hear, nor even make the deaf hear the Appeal once they have turned their backs on it"
  30,53,"You are no one to guide the blind out of their error: only someone who believes in Our signs will listen; since they are committed to (live in) peace"
  30,54,"God is the One Who has created you out of weakness; then He has granted strength following [your] weakness; later on He has granted weakness and grey hairs in place of strength. He creates whatever He wishes; He is the Aware, the Capable"
  30,55,Someday the Hour will be established when criminals will swear they have been hanging around for only an hour. Thus they have (always) shrugged things off
  30,56,"The ones who have been given knowledge and faith will say: \"You have hung around until the Day of Rebirth, but you are such that you do not know it"
  30,57,On that day no excuse of theirs will benefit those who have done wrong nor will they be allowed to argue back
  30,58,"We have set forth every sort of example for men in this Quran. Yet even if you brought them some sign, those who disbelieve would still say: \"You (all) are only trifling"
  30,59,Thus God seals off the hearts of those who will not know
  30,60,Be patient; God´s promise is true. Do not let those who will not be convinced treat you lightly
