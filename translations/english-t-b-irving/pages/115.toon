quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,42,"as listeners to lying, living off graft. If they should come to you, then judge between them or else put them off. If you put them off, they will never harm you in any way, while if you judge among them, then judge fairly. God loves those who deal fairly"
  5,43,"How can they choose you as a judge when they have the Torah, which contains God´s judgment? Yet even then they will turn away, and such persons are not believers"
  5,44,"We have sent down the Torah containing guidance and Light. The prophets who were committed to [live in] peace judge those who were Jews by means of it, and [so do] the rabbis and scholars, because of what they sought to observe from God´s book. They have even acted as witnesses for it. So do not dread mankind, and dread Me; do not buy up My signs for a paltry price. Those who do not judge by what God has sent down disbelievers"
  5,45,"There We prescribed for them a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and wounds should have [similar] compensation. Yet anyone who treats it as charity, [will find] it serves as an atonement for him. Those who do not judge by what God has sent down are wrongdoers"
