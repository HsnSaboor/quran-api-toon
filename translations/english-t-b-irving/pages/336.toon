  22,35,"whose hearts tremble whenever God is mentioned and are patient with anything that may happen to them, and those who keep up prayer and spend something out of whatever We have provided them with"
  22,36,"Animals´ bodies [to be sacrificed] We have granted to you as some of God´s symbols. They contain good for you, so mention God´s name over them as they are lined up [for slaughter]. Once they slump down on their sides, then eat some of them and feed both the [poor man who is] carefree and the one who insists on it. Thus We have subjected them to you so that you may be thankful"
