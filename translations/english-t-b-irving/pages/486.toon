quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  42,23,"That is what God proclaims to those servants of His who believe and perform honorable deeds. SAY: \"I do not ask you any payment for it except affection towards your relatives.\" We shall add to its fineness for anyone who acquires a fine deed. God is Forgiving, Appreciative"
  42,24,"Or do they say: \"He made up a lie about God?\" If God wished, He might seal off you heart: God blots out falsehood and verifies the Truth through His own words. He is Aware of anything that is on your minds"
  42,25,"He is the One Who accepts repentance from His servants and overlooks [their] evil deeds"
  42,26,"and adds even more for them out of His bounty, while disbelievers will have severe torment"
  42,27,"If God were to expand sustenance for His servants, they would act outrageously on earth; but He sends down anything He wishes in [due] measure. He is informed, Observant concerning His worshippers"
  42,28,"He is the one Who sends down showers after they have lost hope, and scatters His mercy aboard. He is the Praiseworthy Patron"
  42,29,"Among His signs is the creation of Heaven and Earth, as well as any animals He has propagated in either of them. He is capable of gathering them whenever He wishes"
  42,30,"Any disaster that happens to you will [occur] because of what your own hands have earned. Yet He overlooks a great deal"
  42,31,You (all) will not frustrate anything on earth nor do you have any patron nor supporter besides God
