quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,25,"Proclaim to those who believe and perform honorable deeds that they will have gardens through which rivers flow. Each time they are provided with fruits from it for their sustenance, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before!\" They will be given similar things and have clean-living spouses there. They will live in it forever"
  2,26,"God does not hesitate to compare things to a mosquito nor to anything bigger than it. Those who believe realize that it is the Truth from their Lord, while those who disbelieve say: \"What does God want in such a comparison?\" He lets so many go astray through it, and guides many by means of it. Yet only immoral persons are led astray by it"
  2,27,"Those who break God´s covenant after they have pledged to keep it, and sever whatever God has ordered to be joined, and act depraved on earth, will be the losers"
  2,28,"How can you disbelieve in God when you once were dead and He furnished you with life? Soon He will let you die once more, then bring you back to life again; then unto Him will you return"
  2,29,He is the One Who has created everything that is on earth for you; then He soared up to Heaven and perfected it as seven heavens. He is Aware of everything
