quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,58,"Whenever you call [people] to prayer, they take it as a joke and a sport. That is because they are folk who do not use their reason"
  5,59,"SAY: \"People of the Book, do you persecute us just because we believe in God and what has been sent down to us, and what was sent down previously? Most of you are perverse"
  5,60,"SAY: \"Shall I announce to you something worse than this as a recompense from God?\"´ Those whom God has cursed and become angry at, and made them into monkeys and swine, and who serve the arrogant ones, are in a worse plight and even further astray from the Level Path"
  5,61,"When they come to you, they say: \"We believe,\" while they have entered with disbelief and they leave with it. God is quite Aware as to what they have been hiding"
  5,62,"You will see many of them plunging into vice and hostility, and living off graft. What they have been doing is so wretched"
  5,63,If their rabbis and scholars had only forbidden them from speaking sinfully and living off graft! How wretched is what they have been producing
  5,64,"The Jews say: \"God´s hand is shackled.\" May their own hands be shackled and themselves cursed because of what they have said! Rather both His hands are outstretched; He dispenses [things] just as He wishes. Anything sent down to you from your Lord increases many of them in arrogation and disbelief. We have tossed hostility and hatred between them until Resurrection Day. Every time they kindle a fire for war, God snuffs it out. They rush around the earth creating havoc. God does not love those who create havoc"
