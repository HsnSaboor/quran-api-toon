quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,7,"How can there be any treaty with associators on the part of God and His messenger, except for those with whom you have ratified one at the Hallowed Mosque? So long as they act straightforwardly with you, be straightforward with them. God loves those who do their duty"
  9,8,"How, if they should overcome you, will they honor any pact or obligation with you? They seek to please you in whatever they say while their hearts refuse to. Most of them are immoral"
  9,9,"they have bought up God´s signs for a paltry price, and obstructed His way. How evil is what they have been doing"
  9,10,They honor no pact nor any obligation with a believer; those are aggressors
  9,11,"Yet if they should repent, keep up prayer and pay the welfare tax, then [they may be) your brethren in religion. We spell out signs for folk who know"
  9,12,"If they should violate their trust once they have sworn it, and insult your religion, then fight the leaders of disbelief; they have no faith to make them stop"
  9,13,Will you not fight folk who have violated their trust and intended to exile the Messenger? They attacked you first! Are you afraid of them? You ought to be even more afraid of God if you are believers
