  2,7,"God has sealed off their hearts and their hearts and their hearing, while over their sight there hangs a covering; they will have severe torment"
  2,8,"Some people say: \"We believe in God and the Last Day,\" while they are not believers"
  2,9,"They would like to deceive God and those who believe, while they merely outwit themselves and do not even notice it"
  2,10,"Their hearts contain malice so God has increased their [share of] malice. They will have painful torment because they have been lying"
  2,11,"Whenever someone tells them: \"Don´t act so depraved on earth,\" they say: \"We are only improving matters"
  2,12,"They are indeed mischief makers, but they are not aware of it"
  2,13,"When someone tells them: \"Believe just as other people believe,\" they say: \"Are we to believe just as simpletons believe?\" Surely they are the fools even though they do not realize it"
  2,14,"Whenever they meet those who believe, they say: \"We believe;´ while once they go off alone with their ringleaders, they say: \"We are with you; we were only joking"
