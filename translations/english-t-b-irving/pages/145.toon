quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,132,everyone will have ranks according to what they have been doing. Your Lord is not oblivious of what they are doing
  6,133,"Your Lord is Transcendent, the Master of Mercy; if He so wished, He would remove you and bring replacements for you in any way He wishes, just as He has produced you from the offspring of other people"
  6,134,What you are promised is coming; you will never avert it
  6,135,"SAY: \"My people, act according to your situation; I [too] am Acting! You will know who will have the Home as a result. The fact is that wrongdoers will not prosper"
  6,136,"They grant God a share in what He has produced such as crops and livestock, and they say: \"This is God´s,´ according to their claim, and: \"This is our associates´.\" Anything that is meant for their associates never reaches God, while what is God´s reaches their associates (too); how evil is whatever they decide"
  6,137,"Even so, their associates have made killing their children seem attractive to many associators, to lead them on to ruin and to confuse their religion for them. If God so wishes, they would not do so; so leave them alone and whatever they are inventing"
