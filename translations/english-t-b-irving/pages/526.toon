quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By The Star as it sets
  53,2,your companion has neither strayed nor is he misguided
  53,3,He does not speak from some whim
  53,4,"it is merely inspiration that is revealed [to him]"
  53,5,Someone firm in strength has taught him
  53,6,someone possessing such ability that he soared up
  53,7,"and stood, poised at the highest [point on the] horizon"
  53,8,Then he approached and came right down
  53,9,and stood two bow-lengths off or even closer
  53,10,He inspired whatever he inspired in His servant
  53,11,His vitals did not deny whatever he saw
  53,12,"Yet will you (all) distrust him about what he [actually] saw"
  53,13,He saw him in another descent
  53,14,near the Hawthorne on the Boundary
  53,15,alongside the Garden of Repose
  53,16,When whatever covered the Hawthorn covered it
  53,17,his eyesight did not falter nor was it carried away
  53,18,He saw some of his Lord´s greatest signs
  53,19,Have you (all) considered al-Lat and al-Uzza
  53,20,"and Manat the other [who ranks] in third place"
  53,21,Do you have sons while He has daughters
  53,22,That would then be an unfair attribution
  53,23,They are only some names which you and your forefathers have called them; God has not sent down any authority for them. They merely follow conjecture and something their souls fancy. Yet guidance has already reached them from their Lord
  53,24,Or may man have anything he hankers for
  53,25,Yet God still holds the Last as well as the First
  53,26,"How many angels are there in Heaven whose intercession does not help in any way except after God permits it, for whomever He wishes and approves of"
