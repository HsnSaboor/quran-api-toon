quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  9,94,"They will apologize to you when you (all) return to them. SAY: \"Don´t apologize; we will never believe you! God has already notified us concerning everything about you. God and His messenger will see how you act; then you will be sent back to the Knower of the Unseen and the visible, and he will notify you about whatever you have been doing"
  9,95,"They will swear [anything] to you by God when you go back home to them, provided you will overlook them. Overlook them anyhow: they are a blight and their lodging will be Hell as a compensation for what they have been earning"
  9,96,"They swear to you so you will (all) feel satisfied with them. Even if you should approve of them, God is still not pleased with such immoral folk"
  9,97,"Desert Arabs are quite stubborn when it comes to disbelief and hypocrisy, and the least inclined to acknowledge the limits that God has revealed to His messenger; yet God is Aware, Wise"
  9,98,"Some desert tribesmen assume that anything they spend [in taxes] is a fine, and they try to catch you in some reverses. On them will fall the worst reversed. God is Alert, Aware"
  9,99,"Still other desert Arabs believe in God and the Last Day, and consider anything that is spent as a means of access to God and the Messengers prayers. Yet are they indeed not such an access for them? God will admit them into His mercy; God is Forgiving, Merciful"
