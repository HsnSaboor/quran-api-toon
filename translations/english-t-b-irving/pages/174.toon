quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  7,179,"We have bred many sprites and humans for Hell: they have hearts they do not understand with, and eyes they do not see with, and ears they do not hear with. Those persons are like livestock: in fact, they are even further off track, They are heedless"
  7,180,"God has the Finest Names, so appeal to Him by name and leave those who blaspheme against His names alone; they will be rewarded for whatever they have been doing"
  7,181,"Some of those whom We have created form a nation which guides [men] by means of the Truth, and because of it they act justly"
  7,182,We shall gradually bring those who reject Our signs from a place they do not recognize
  7,183,"I shall let them go on, for My scheme is sure"
  7,184,Have they not thought things over? There is no madness in their companion; he is merely a plain warner
  7,185,"Have they not observed in the sovereignty over Heaven and Earth and whatever God has created of any sort, that perhaps their deadline may be approaching? In what report will they believe later on"
  7,186,Anyone whom God lets go astray will have no guide; He leaves them groping along in their arrogance
  7,187,"They may ask you about the Hour: \"When will it arrive?´ SAY \"Knowledge about it rests only with my Lord; He Alone will disclose it time. Things will seem heavy in Heaven and Earth; it will simply come upon you all of a sudden!\" They will even ask you as if you yourself were anxious about it. SAY ´Knowledge about it rests only with God, though most people do not realize it"
