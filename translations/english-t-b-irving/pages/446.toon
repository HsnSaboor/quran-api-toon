quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,1,As the Ranks are drawn up
  37,2,rebuking with restraint
  37,3,and reciting a Reminder
  37,4,"your God is One [Alone]"
  37,5,"Lord of Heaven and Earth and whatever lies between them, plus Lord of the Eastern parts"
  37,6,We have beautified the worldly sky with the splendor of stars
  37,7,plus a safeguard against every stubborn devil
  37,8,so they may not listen to the supreme council and are hurled forth on every side
  37,9,"Driven away, they will have lingering torment"
  37,10,except for someone who tries to eavesdrop so that a blazing meteor follows him
  37,11,Ask their opinion whether they or someone We created have been created stronger. We created them from sticky clay
  37,12,Rather you have been surprised as they sneered
  37,13,"yet whenever they are reminded, they do not recall anything"
  37,14,"Whenever they see some sign, they make fun of it"
  37,15,"and say: \"This is just sheer magic"
  37,16,"When we have died and become dust and bones, will we be raised up again"
  37,17,Along with our earliest forefathers
  37,18,"SAY: \"Yes, and you yourselves abashed"
  37,19,"There will only be a single rebuke and then, they shall see"
  37,20,"They will say: ´How awful it is for us; this is the Day for Repayment"
  37,21,This is the day for sorting things out which you have been denying
  37,22,"Summon the ones who have done wrong plus their spouses, and anything they have been worshipping"
  37,23,instead of God; lead them along the road towards Hades
  37,24,Stop them! They must be questioned
