quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,"Those believers who sit around and yet have no physical disability are not equal to those who strive for God´s sake with their property and persons. God shows preference to those who strive with their property and persons through [higher] rank, than with those who just sit around; for each, God has promised handsome things, yet God shows preference to strivers with a better wage over those who stay at home"
  4,96,"such as [higher] ranks from Him, as well as forgiveness and mercy. God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  4,97,"Those whom the angels will gather up [and] tell, as they are harming themselves: \"What were you [busy] with?\", will say: \"We were acting as weaklings on earth.\" They will say: ´Is not God´s earth so vast you might settle down elsewhere on it?\" Those will have their refuge in Hell, and how evil is such a goal"
  4,98,"except for those men, women and children who are [really] helpless and cannot find any other means nor a they guided in any way"
  4,99,"those God may eventually pardon. God is Pardoning, Forgiving"
  4,100,"Anyone who migrates for God´s sake will find many places for asylum and accommodation on earth. Whoever leaves his home as refugee for God´s and His messenger´s sake, then has death overtake him, will receive his earnings as God´s responsibility. God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  4,101,"It will not be held against you when you travel out into the world should you shorten prayer, if you fear those who disbelieve may harass you. Disbelievers are open enemies of yours"
