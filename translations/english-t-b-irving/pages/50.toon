quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,1,L. M
  3,2,"God, there is no deity except Him, the Living, the Eternal"
  3,3,He has sent down the Book to you with Truth to confirm whatever existed before it. He sent down the Torah and the Gospel
  3,4,"in the past as guidance for mankind; He has (also) sent down the Standard. Those who disbelieve in God´s signs will have severe torment- God is Powerful, the Master of Retribution"
  3,5,"Nothing is hidden from God, on Earth nor in Heaven"
  3,6,"He it is Who shapes you just as He wishes in [your mothers´] wombs. There is no deity except Him, the Powerful, the Wise"
  3,7,"He is the One Who sent you down the Book which contains decisive verses. They [form] the basis of the Book; while others are allegorical. Those whose hearts are prone to falter follow whatever is allegorical in it, seeking to create dissension by giving [their own] interpretation of it. Yet only God knows its interpretation; those who are versed in knowledge say: \"We believe in it; it all comes from our Lord!\" However only prudent persons bear it in mind"
  3,8,"Our Lord, do not let our hearts falter once You have guided us; grant us mercy from Your presence, for You are the Bountiful"
  3,9,"Our Lord, You will be gathering mankind together on a day there is no doubt about; God will never go back on the Promise"
