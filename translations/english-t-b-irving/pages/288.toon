quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,59,"Nothing has prevented Us from sending except that early men rejected them. We sent Thamud the she-camel to open their eyes, yet they mistreated her. We merely send signs in order to frighten [people]"
  17,60,"Thus We told you: \"Your Lord embraces [all] kind.\" We granted the vision which We showed you only as a test for mankind, as well as the Tree that is cursed in the Quran. We let them feel afraid; yet it only increases great arrogance in them"
  17,61,"When We told the angels: \"Bow down on your knees before Adam,\" they (all) knelt down except Diabolis. He said: \"Am I to bow down on my knees before someone You have created out of clay"
  17,62,"He said [further] : \"Have You considered this person Yourself whom You have honored more than me? If You will postpone things for m Resurrection Day, then I shall bring all but a few of his offspring un mastery"
  17,63,"He said: \"Go away! Any of them who follows you will have your reward; it is such an ample reward"
  17,64,"Entice any of them whom you can with your voice. Set upon them with your cavalry and your manpower. Share wealth and children with them, and promise them anything. (Yet Satan merely promises them illusion)"
  17,65,"As for My servants, you will have no authority over them; your Lord suffices as a Trustee"
  17,66,"Your Lord is the One Who propels ships for you at sea, so you may seek some of His bounty. He has been so Merciful towards you"
