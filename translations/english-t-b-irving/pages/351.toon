  24,11,"Those who have brought up such slander form a clique among you. Do not reckon it is a bad thing for you; rather it will be good for you: every last man of them shall be charged with whatever he has committed the way of an offence, while whoever has assumed his leadership over them [through such gossiping] will have serious torment"

  24,16,"If you had only said as you heard it: \"We ought not to talk about this. Glory be to You! This is serious slander"
  24,17,God cautions you never to repeat anything like it again if you are believers
