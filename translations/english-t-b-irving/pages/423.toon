quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,No believing man nor any believing woman should exercise any choice in their affair once God and His messenger have decided upon some matter. Anyone who disobeys God and His messenger has wandered off into manifest error
  33,37,"Thus you told someone whom God had favored and whom you yourself have favored: \"Hold on to your wife, and heed God,\" while you kept to yourself what God had disclosed and you dreaded people[´s opinion], although it is more correct for you to dread God. Once Zayd had accomplished his purpose with her, We married her off to you so that there would be no objection for believers in respect to their adopted son´s wives once they have accomplished their purpose with them. God´s command must be done"
  33,38,"The Prophet is not to be reproached for [doing] what God has stipulated for him to do. God´s practice has been such with those who have passed on already-God´s command is a pre-ordained decree"
  33,39,"for those who transmit God´s messages and dread him, while they do not dread anyone else than God. God suffices as a Reckoner"
  33,40,"Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but [he is] God´s messenger and the Seal of the Prophets. God is Aware of everything"
  33,41,"You who believe, remember God often"
  33,42,Celebrate him morning and evening
  33,43,"He is the One Who accepts prayers from you, as do His angels, to lead you out of darkness into Light. He is Merciful with believers"
