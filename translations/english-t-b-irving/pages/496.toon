  44,1,M
  44,2,By the Clear Book
  44,3,which We sent down on a blessed night We have been warning about
  44,4,In it every wise matter is set forth
  44,5,as a command from Our presence; We have been sending
  44,6,"mercy from your Lord. He is the Alert, Aware"
  44,7,"Lord of Heaven and Earth and anything in between them, if you will be convinced"
  44,8,"There is no deity except Him; He gives life and brings death, your Lord and the Lord of your earliest ancestors"
  44,9,Instead they play around with doubt
  44,10,Watch out for the day when the sky will bring obvious smoke
  44,11,to envelop mankind; this will mean painful torment
  44,12,"Our Lord, remove the torment from us; we are believers"
  44,13,"Yet they had the Reminder, and an obvious messenger had already come to them"
  44,14,"Then they turned away from him and said: \"He has been taught it; [he´s] so crazy"
  44,15,"Were We to lift the torment for a while, you would still revert [to it]"
  44,16,Some day We will kidnap everyone in the greatest operation; We shall be Avenged
  44,17,"We tested Pharaoh´s folk before them, and a noble messenger came to them"
  44,18,Hand over God´s servants to me. I am a trustworthy messenger for you
