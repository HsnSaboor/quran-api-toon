  103,3,"except for those who believe, perform honorable deeds, encourage Truth, and recommend patience"
  104,1,"How awful [will it be] for every backbiting slanderer"
  104,2,who hoards wealth and keeps on adding to it
  104,3,He reckons that his money will make him immortal
  104,4,Nevertheless he will be flung into the Bonecrusher
  104,5,What will make you realize what the Bonecrusher is
  104,6,"[It is] God´s kindled fire"
  104,7,which leaps up to clutch at one´s vitals
  104,8,It will be vaulted over them
  104,9,in outstretched columns
  105,1,Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant
  105,2,Did He not cause their plan to miscarry
  105,3,and sent birds in flocks against them
  105,4,which threw stamped clay pellets at them
  105,5,It left them just like chewed-up chaff
