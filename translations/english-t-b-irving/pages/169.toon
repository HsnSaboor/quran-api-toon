quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,150,"When Moses returned angry, sorrowful to his folk, he said: ´What an awful thing you have committed behind my back! Have you tried to hurry up your Lord´s command?\" He dropped the Tablets and seized his brother by the head, pulling him towards himself. He said: \"Son of my mother, the people felt I was weak and they almost killed me! Don´t let any enemies gloat over me nor place me with such wrongdoing folk"
  7,151,"He said: ´My Lord, forgive me and my brother, and let us enter Your mercy! You are the most Merciful of those who show mercy"
  7,152,"Anger and disgrace from their Lord will be awarded those who accepted the calf during worldly life. Thus We reward those who invent [such things]"
  7,153,"as for those who perform evil deeds, then repent later on and believe, your Lord will later on be Forgiving, Merciful"
  7,154,"When his anger had subsided, Moses picked up the Tablets whose text contained guidance and mercy for those who revere their Lord"
  7,155,"Moses chose his people, seventy men, for an appointment with Us. When the Tremor seized them, he said: \"My Lord, even though You may have wished to wipe them out and myself (as well) earlier, are You wiping us out just because of what some fools among us have done? It is only Your manner of testing: You let anyone You wish to, go astray by means of it, and let anyone You wish, to be guided. You are our Patron, so pardon us and show us mercy; You are the best Pardoner"
