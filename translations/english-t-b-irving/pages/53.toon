quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,23,"Have you not considered those who were given a portion [of knowledge] from the Book? They were invited to [accept] God´s book so it might judge between them; then a group of them turned away and disregarded [it]"
  3,24,"That is because they say: \"The Fire will never touch us except for several days.\" Whatever they have invented about their religion has led them astray"
  3,25,"How will it be when We gather them in on a day there is no doubt about, and each soul will be paid off according to whatever it has earned? They will not be wronged"
  3,26,"SAY: \"O God, Holder of control! You give control to anyone You wish and snatch control from anyone You wish. You exalt anyone You wish and humble anyone You wish. Good lies within Your hand; You are Capable of everything"
  3,27,"You wrap night up in daylight, and wrap daytime up in night. You draw the living from the dead, and draw the dead from the living. You provide for anyone You wish without any reckoning"
  3,28,"Believers should not enlist disbelievers as patrons in preference to [other] believers. Anyone who does so will have nothing to do with God, so you should take precautions against them. God warns you about Himself-, for towards God lies the Goal"
  3,29,"SAY: \"Whether you hide what is on your minds or disclose it, God knows it [anyhow]; He knows whatever is in Heaven and whatever is on Earth God is Capable of everything"
