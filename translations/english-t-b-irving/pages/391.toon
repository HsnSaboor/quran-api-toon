quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,44,"You [Muhammad], were not (present) on the western slope when We settled the matter for Moses, nor were you a witness"
  28,45,"but We raised up some generations, and [their] lifetime was prolonged for them. Nor were you a resident among the people of Midian, reciting Our signs to them, but We were [to send] emissaries"
  28,46,"You were not on the slope of Mount [Sinai] when We called out, but [have been sent] as a mercy from your Lord so you might warn a folk whom no warner had come to before you, so that they might bear it in mind"
  28,47,"If only some calamity would strike them because of what [evil] their hands have sent on ahead, and so they would say: \"Our Lord, if only you had sent us some messenger, we should have followed Your signs and been believers"
  28,48,"Yet when the Truth did come to them from Our presence, they said: \"If he were only given the same as Moses was given!\" Still had they not already disbelieved in what Moses was given? They say: \"Double magic, to back each other up!\" And they say: \"We disbelieve in everything"
  28,49,"SAY: \"Bring a book from God´s presence which will be a better guide than either of them so I may follow it if you are that truthful"
  28,50,"If they do not respond to you, then know they are merely following their own whims. Who is more misguided than someone who follows his own whim without having any guidance from God? God does not guide wrongdoing folk"
