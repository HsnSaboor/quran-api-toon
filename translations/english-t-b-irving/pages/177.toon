quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,1,"They will ask you about Booty. SAY: \"Booty belongs to God and the Messenger, so heed God and patch up any [differences] that may stand between you. Obey God and His messenger if you are believers"
  8,2,Believers are merely those whose hearts feel wary whenever God is mentioned and whose faith increases when His verses are recited to them. On their Lord do they rely
  8,3,Those who keep up prayer and spend some of whatever We have provided them with
  8,4,"are truly believers. They hold rank before their Lord, as well as forgiveness and generous provision"
  8,5,"just as your Lord sent you forth from your home with the Truth, even though a group of believers disliked it"
  8,6,"They will argue with you about the Truth even after it has been explained, just as if they were only being driven along towards death and were expecting it"
  8,7,"When God promised you that one of the two bands would be yours, you preferred the one that had no weapons [to fall] to you, while God wanted the Truth to be verified through His words and to cut off the last remnant of the disbelievers"
  8,8,so He might verify the Truth and disprove falsehood no matter how criminals might dislike it
