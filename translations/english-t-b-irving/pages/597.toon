quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the Figtree and the Olive
  95,2,Mount Sinai
  95,3,and this safe countryside
  95,4,We have created man with the finest stature
  95,5,then reduced him to the dregs on the bottom
  95,6,except for those who believe and perform honorable deeds-their earnings shall never be withheld from them
  95,7,What would make you reject religion later on
  95,8,Is God not the Wisest of those who judge
  96,1,READ in the name of your Lord Who creates
  96,2,creates man from a clot
  96,3,"READ, for your Lord is most Generous"
  96,4,"[it is He] Who teaches by means of the pen"
  96,5,teaches man what he does not know
  96,6,However man acts so arrogant
  96,7,for he considers he is self-sufficient
  96,8,Yet to your Lord will be the Return
  96,9,Have you seen someone who stops
  96,10,a worshipper as he prays
  96,11,"Have you considered whether he is [looking] for guidance"
  96,12,or ordering heedfulness
  96,13,"Have you seen whether he has rejected [the message] and turned away"
  96,14,"Does he not know that God sees [everything]"
  96,15,"Of course not! Yet if he does not stop, We shall catch him by his forelock"
  96,16,"Such a lying, sinful forelock"
  96,17,Let him appeal to his henchmen
  96,18,"We shall appeal to the avenging [angels]"
  96,19,"Of course, do not obey him; bow down on your knees, and come closer"
