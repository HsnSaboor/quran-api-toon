quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,69,"Those who do their duty are not accountable for them in any way except to remind [them], so that they [in turn] may do their duty"
  6,70,"Stay away from those who take their religion as a sport and amusement. Worldly life has lured them on. Remind [them] of it lest any soul become reckless because of what he has earned; he will have no patron nor any other intercessor besides God. Even if he were to proffer every alternative, such would not be accepted from him. Those who let themselves act recklessly concerning what they have earned must drink boiling water and suffer painful torment because of how they have disbelieved"
  6,71,"SAY: \"Should we appeal to something that can neither benefit nor harm us, instead of to God? Shall we turn on our heels now that God has guided us, bewildered like someone whom the devils have enticed away on earth, while his companions are calling him to guidance: ´Come to us!´"
  6,72,"SAY: \"God´s guidance means [real] guidance. We have been ordered to commit ourselves peacefully to the Lord of the Universe"
  6,73,´Keep up prayer and heed Him!´ He is the One before Whom you will (all) be summoned
