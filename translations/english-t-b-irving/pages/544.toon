quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  58,12,"You who believe, whenever you confer with the Messenger, offer some sort of charity before you confer [with him]; that will be better for you, and purer [besides]. Yet if you do not find anything [to give], God is still Forgiving, Merciful"
  58,13,"Are you worried about proffering some charity before your consultation? If you do not do so, God still turns towards you, so keep up prayer and pay the welfare tax, and obey God and His messenger. God is Informed about anything you do"
  58,14,"Have you not considered those who make friends with a folk whom God is angry with? They are neither on your side nor yet on their own, and they perjure themselves while they know it"
  58,15,"God has prepared severe torment for them; with them, anything they do is evil"
  58,16,They have taken their faith as a disguise and obstructed God´s way. They will have disgraceful torment
  58,17,neither their wealth nor their children will help them out in any way with God. Those will become inmates of the Fire; they will remain there forever
  58,18,Someday God will raise them all up together and they will swear to Him just as they have sworn to you; they reckon they will get something out of it. They are such liars
  58,19,Satan has won them over and made them forget to mention God; those are Satan´s party. Yet Satan´s side will be the losers
  58,20,Those who would limit God and His messenger are the vilest sort
  58,21,"God has written: \"I shall prevail, both I Myself and My messengers!\" God is Strong, Powerful"
