quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,Lot´s folk rejected the emissaries
  26,161,"when their brother Lot said to them: \"Will you not do your duty"
  26,162,"I am a trustworthy messenger [sent] to you"
  26,163,so heed God and obey me
  26,164,I do not ask you any payment for it; my payment only concerns the Lord of the Universe
  26,165,"Do you approach males among [everyone in] the Universe"
  26,166,and ignore any wives whom your Lord has created for you? Indeed you are such defiant folk
  26,167,"They said; \"If you do not stop, Lot, you will become an exile"
  26,168,"He said: \"I am someone who detests your behavior"
  26,169,"My Lord, save me and my family from what they are doing"
  26,170,So We saved him and his whole family
  26,171,except for an old woman among those who stayed behind
  26,172,Then We annihilated the rest
  26,173,We sent a rain down upon them. How evil was such a rain for those who had been warned
  26,174,In that is a sign; though most of them are not believers
  26,175,"Yet your Lord is the Powerful, the Merciful"
  26,176,The dwellers in the Forest rejected the emissaries
  26,177,"when Shuayb said to them: \"Will you not perform your duty"
  26,178,"I am a trustworthy messenger [sent] to you"
  26,179,so heed God and obey me
  26,180,I do not ask you for any payment for it; my payment only concerns the Lord of the Universe
  26,181,"Give full measure and do not cause [people] any losses"
  26,182,Weigh with honest scales
  26,183,do not undersell people to cheat them of their things nor storm around the earth in order to spoil matters
