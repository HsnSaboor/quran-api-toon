quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  43,11,"Who has sent down water from the sky in due measure.\" Just so have We raised up a dead land with it; thus you (all) will come forth too"
  43,12,"[He is] the One Who has created all [sorts] of species, and granted you ships and livestock to ride on"
  43,13,"so you may mount on their backs. Then once you have mounted (or boarded) them, remember your Lord´s favor and say: \"Glory be to Him Who has subjected these to our [use]; we (ourselves) would never achieve it"
  43,14,We shall be sent home to our Lord
  43,15,Still they have assigned a portion of His own servants to Him; man is so obviously thankless
  43,16,Or should He adopt daughters from what He creates and single out sons for you
  43,17,"Whenever one of them is notified about the same as he imputes concerning the Mercy-giving, his face becomes dark with gloom and he feels like choking"
  43,18,"Is someone who is set up just to look pretty while he is unable to discuss things clearly [worth worshipping]"
  43,19,They even pretend the angels who are the Mercy-giving´s servants are females! Were they present at their own creation? Their testimony will be written down and they will be questioned about it
  43,20,"They say: \"If the Mercy-giving had so wished, we would not have worshipped them.\" No matter what knowledge they may have about that, they are still merely guessing"
  43,21,Or have We given them a book already which they try to hold on to
  43,22,"Moreover they say: \"We found our forefathers following such a community and we are merely being guided along their tracks"
