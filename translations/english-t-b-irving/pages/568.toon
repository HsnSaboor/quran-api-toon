quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,He has no close friend here today
  69,36,nor any food except for some garbage
  69,37,which only sinners eat
  69,38,Yet I swear by whatever you observe
  69,39,and what you do not observe
  69,40,"that it is a statement [made] by a noble messenger"
  69,41,It is no poet´s statement; how little do you believe
  69,42,Nor is it some fortune teller´s statement; how little do you think things over
  69,43,"[It is] something sent down by the Lord of the Universe"
  69,44,"If he had mouthed some [false] statements about Us"
  69,45,We would have seized him by the right hand
  69,46,then cut off his main artery
  69,47,Not one of you would have prevented it
  69,48,It is a Reminder for the heedful
  69,49,We know too that some of you will reject it
  69,50,It means despair for disbelievers
  69,51,yet it is the absolute Truth
  69,52,So hymn your Lord´s almighty name
  70,1,A skeptic was asking about torment that is bound to happen
  70,2,to disbelievers; there will be no defense against it
  70,3,"[since it comes] from God Who owns the staircases leading upward"
  70,4,The angels and the Spirit will climb up to Him on a day whose range is fifty thousand years
  70,5,So act patient with a handsome patience
  70,6,They consider it is far away
  70,7,while We see it as nearby
  70,8,on a day when the sky will be like molten brass
  70,9,and the mountains like tufts of yarn
  70,10,"No close friend will question any [other] friend"
