quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the Sun and its radiance
  91,2,and the moon as it trails after it
  91,3,and daylight which shines resplendent from it
  91,4,and night when it covers things up
  91,5,and the sky and whatever built it
  91,6,and the earth and what has stretched it out
  91,7,and any soul and whatever has fashioned it
  91,8,and filled it with both its debauchery and its sense of duty
  91,9,Anyone who purifies himself will prosper
  91,10,while whoever neglects to do so will be disappointed
  91,11,Thamud rejected it through their arrogance
  91,12,when their meanest wretch was delegated
  91,13,"and God´s messenger told them: \"[Here is) God´s she-camel; give her its day to drink"
  91,14,"They rejected him and mistreated her, so their Lord snarled at them because of their offence and leveled things off"
  91,15,He does not fear its outcome
  92,1,By night as it broods
  92,2,and daylight when things seem radiant
  92,3,and whatever has created the male and the female
  92,4,your effort has been too diffuse
  92,5,"For anyone who gives (generously], performs his duty"
  92,6,and acts charitably in the finest manner
  92,7,We shall facilitate an easy way for him
  92,8,"while anyone who acts miserably, and feels he is self-sufficient"
  92,9,"and rejects the finest [things in life]"
  92,10,"We shall make it easy for him (to go] the hard way"
  92,11,His money will not help him out as he stumbles along
  92,12,Guidance is Our concern
  92,13,"to Us belongs the Hereafter and the very First [of life]"
  92,14,so I have warned you (all) about a raging fire
