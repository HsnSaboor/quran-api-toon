quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  7,164,"Whenever a community among them said: \"Why do you lecture a folk whom God will destroy anyhow, or [at least] punish them severely?\" they said: \"To gain absolution from your Lord, and so they may do their duty"
  7,165,"When they forgot what they had been reminded of, We rescued those who had forbidden evil while We seized those who were doing wrong with dreadful torment because they had been acting so immorally"
  7,166,"When they became insolent about what had been forbidden them, we told them: \"Become apes who will be chased away"
  7,167,"So your Lord announced that He would send someone against them who would impose the worst torment on them until Resurrection Day. Your Lord is Prompt with punishment, while He is (also) Forgiving, Merciful"
  7,168,We split them up into nations (that exist) on earth. Some of them are honorable while some of them are otherwise. We have tested them with fine things and evil things so they might repent
  7,169,"Successors replaced them afterward who inherited the Book, taking on the show of this lowly place and saying: ´It will be forgiven us.´ If a show like it were give them (again), they would accept it. Was not an agreement concerning the Book accepted by them: that they would tell nothing but the Truth about God? They studied what was in it. A home in the Hereafter is better for those who do their duty - do they not use their reason"
  7,170,As for those who hold onto the Book and keep up prayer-We shall never forfeit reformers´ wages
