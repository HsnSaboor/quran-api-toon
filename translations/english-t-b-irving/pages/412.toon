quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  31,12,"We gave Luqman wisdom: Give thanks to God. Anyone who gives thanks, merely gives thanks for his own sake; while anyone who is ungrateful [will find] God is Transcendent, Praiseworthy. Association is a Serious Sin"
  31,13,"Thus Luqman told his son as he was instructing him: \"My dear son, do not associate anything [in your worship] of God [Alone]. Association is such a serious wrong"
  31,14,"We have commissioned (every)man to [look after] his parents: his mother bears him with one fainting spell after another fainting spell, while his weaning takes two years. Thank Me as well as your parents; towards Me lies the Goal"
  31,15,"Yet if either of them should strive to make you associate anything with Me which you have no knowledge about, do not obey them although you should (still) keep company with both of them properly during [their life in] this world. Follow the way of anyone who feels concerned about Me. Then to Me will be your return and I shall notify you about whatever you have been doing"
  31,16,"My dear son, if there existed the weight of a mustard seed, and it lay in some boulder in either Heaven or Earth, God would still bring it forth. God is so Gracious, Informed"
  31,17,"My dear son, keep up prayer, command what is proper and forbid dishonor. Endure patiently whatever may afflict you; for that shows determination in [handling] matters"
  31,18,"Do not sneer down your cheek at other men nor walk brashly around the earth: God does not love every swaggering boaster"
  31,19,"Act modestly in the way you walk, and lower your voice: The ugliest sound is a donkey´s voice"
