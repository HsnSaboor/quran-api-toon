quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,Instead you prefer worldly life
  87,17,whereas the Hereafter is better and more enduring
  87,18,"This has been [written] on the earliest scrolls"
  87,19,the scriptures of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Has the story of the Pall ever reached you
  88,2,Some faces will be downcast on that day
  88,3,"laboring, toiling"
  88,4,They will roast in a scorching fire
  88,5,offered a boiling spring to drink from
  88,6,they will have no food except some cactus
  88,7,which will neither fatten (them) nor satisfy their hunger
  88,8,Other faces will be blissful on that day
  88,9,pleased with their effort
  88,10,(dwelling) in a lofty garden
  88,11,No loose talk will be heard in it
  88,12,There will be a flowing spring there
  88,13,by it couches will be raised up
  88,14,glasses set in place
  88,15,cushions lined up
  88,16,and carpets spread around
  88,17,Do they not consider how camels have been created
  88,18,Nor how the sky has been lifted up
  88,19,Nor how the mountains have been erected
  88,20,Nor even how the earth has been flattened out
  88,21,"So remind: you need only to remind"
  88,22,You are no taskmaster set up over them
  88,23,except for someone who turns away and disbelieves
  88,24,God will punish him with the worst torment
  88,25,Toward Us lies their retreat
  88,26,then their reckoning will fall on Us
