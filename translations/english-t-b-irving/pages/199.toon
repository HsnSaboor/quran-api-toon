quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,73,"Prophet, struggle with disbelievers and hypocrites; deal harshly with them: their lodging will be Hell, and how awful is such a destination"
  9,74,"They swear by God they have said nothing while they did pronounce the word of disbelief, they disbelieve after their commitment to [live in] peace; and worry over what they do not accomplish. How spitefully they act merely because God and His messenger have enriched them out of His bounty. If they should repent, it would be better for them; while if they turn back again, God will punish them with painful torment in this world and the Hereafter. They will have no sponsor nor any supporter on earth"
  9,75,"Some of them have pledged to God: \"If He gives us some of His bounty, we will act charitably and be loyal"
  9,76,"Yet whenever He has given them some of His bounty, they have acted miserably with it: they turn away and become evasive"
  9,77,so He planted hypocrisy in their hearts till the day when they will meet Him because they broke their word to God which they had promised Him and for how they had been lying
  9,78,"Do they not realize that God knows their secrets and their intrigue, and that God is the Knower of Unseen things"
  9,79,"May God scoff at those who criticize such believers as dedicate themselves to charitable works those who do not find anything [to offer] except their own effort, so they scoff at them too. They will have painful torment"
