quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,27,"Then later on God will turn towards anyone He wishes. God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  9,28,"You who believe, associators are nothing but filthy, so they should not approach the Hallowed Mosque after this year that they still have. If you should fear destitution, God will enrich you out of His bounty if He so wishes. God is Aware, Wise"
  9,29,"Fight the ones among those who were given the Book who do not believe in God nor the Last Day, nor forbid whatever God and His messenger have forbidden, nor profess the True Religion, until they pay the polltax of their own accord and act submissive"
  9,30,"Jews say: \"Ezra was God´s son,\" while Christians say: \"Christ was God´s son.\" That is what they say with their mouths, imitating what those have said who disbelieved before them. May God fight them off for what they have trumped up"
  9,31,"They have adopted their scholars and monks as lords instead of God, plus Christ, the son of Mary. Yet they have been ordered to serve only God Alone; there is no deity except Him. Glory be to Him ahead of whatever they may associate [with Him]"
