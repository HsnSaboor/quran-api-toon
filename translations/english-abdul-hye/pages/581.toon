quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Have We not created you from a worthless fluid (semen)
  77,21,which We placed in a place of safety (womb)
  77,22,for a known period
  77,23,So We have measured (its term) and We are the best to measure (things)
  77,24,Woe on that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)
  77,25,Have We not made the earth a home for both
  77,26,the living and the dead
  77,27,"placed on it firm, tall and high mountains, and given you sweet water to drink"
  77,28,Woe on that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)
  77,29,"(It will be said to the disbelievers on the Day of Judgment): “You depart to that (hell) which you used to deny"
  77,30,You depart towards the shadow (of hellfire smoke ascending) in 3 columns
  77,31,neither shady nor of any use against the fierce flame of the fire
  77,32,surely! it (hell) throws up huge sparks like a castle
  77,33,as if they were yellow camels.”
  77,34,Woe on that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)
  77,35,That will be the Day when they shall not be able to speak
  77,36,they will not be permitted to put forth any excuse for them
  77,37,Woe on that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)
  77,38,Such will be the Day of decision! We will bring you and your previous generations together
  77,39,"So, if you have a plot, then plot against Me"
  77,40,Woe on that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)
  77,41,"Surely, the pious shall reside in shades and springs"
  77,42,and they will have whatever fruits they desire
  77,43,"(It will be said to them): “Eat and drink comfortably for that which you used to do (good deeds).”"
  77,44,"Surely, thus We will reward the righteous"
  77,45,Woe on that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)
  77,46,"(O disbelievers)! Eat and enjoy yourselves (in this worldly life) for a little while. Surely, you are the criminals"
  77,47,Woe on that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)
  77,48,"When it is said to them: “Bow down yourself (in prayer before Allah)!” They don’t bow down"
  77,49,Woe on that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)
