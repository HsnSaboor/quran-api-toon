quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,as they recline on high couches and look (at then saying)
  83,36,“Are not the disbelievers rewarded for what they used to do?”
  84,1,When the heaven will split asunder
  84,2,listens to and obeys its Lord and it must do so
  84,3,And when the earth will stretch out
  84,4,and cast out all that is in it and becomes empty
  84,5,listens and obeys to its Lord and it must do so
  84,6,"O mankind! Surely, you must strive very hard towards your Lord; then you will meet (Allah)"
  84,7,Then those who will be given their record (of deeds) in their right hand
  84,8,surely they will receive easy reckoning
  84,9,and will return to their family in joy
  84,10,But those who will be given their record (deeds) from behind their back
  84,11,will invoke for destruction
  84,12,and shall burn in a blazing fire
  84,13,for they used to live among their people in joy
  84,14,and thought that they would never come back (to Us for accounts)
  84,15,"Yes! Surely, their Lord was watching (over their misdeeds)"
  84,16,So I swear by the glow of sunset
  84,17,and by the night and whatever it gathers in its darkness
  84,18,and by the moon when it grows full
  84,19,that you will certainly travel from stage to stage (this life and the Hereafter)
  84,20,What is the matter with the people that they don’t believe
  84,21,"and when the Qur’an is recited to them, they don’t prostrate"
  84,22,"Nay, the disbelievers will deny (Islam)"
  84,23,and Allah knows best what they are hiding (in their hearts)
  84,24,"So, announce to them, a painful punishment"
  84,25,except those who believe and do good deeds; for them there will be a never ending reward (Paradise)
