quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"Those who believe say: “Why is not a Surah (chapter of the Qur’an) sent down (to allow us to fight)? But when a decisive Surah is sent down and fighting (in Allah’s Cause) is mentioned in it, you will see those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy) looking at you with a look of one fainting to death. But it was better for them"
  47,21,"Obedience (to Allah) and good words (are better for them). When the matter (preparation for fight) is resolved, then if they had been true to Allah, it would have been better for them"
  47,22,"Would you might then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship"
  47,23,Such are they whom Allah has cursed so that He has made them deaf and blinded their sight
  47,24,Will they not then think deeply in the Qur’an? Or are there locks in their hearts
  47,25,"Surely, those who turn on their backs after the guidance has become clear, Satan has beautified for them (false hopes), and (Allah) has prolonged them (their age)"
  47,26,"This is because they said to those who hate what Allah has sent down: “We will obey you in some matter,” but Allah knows their secrets"
  47,27,"Then what will they do when the angels will take their souls at death, striking their faces and their backs"
  47,28,That is because they followed what angered Allah and hated what pleased Him. So He made their deeds wasted
  47,29,Or do those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy) think that Allah will never bring to light their hidden ill-wills
