  7,92,"Those who denied Shuaib were as if they never lived in it (their homes). Those who denied Shuaib, they were the losers"

  7,95,"Then We changed in place of the evil with the good, until they increased (in number and in wealth), and said: ‘Surely, our forefathers were touched with calamity and affluence (prosperity).” So We seized them suddenly while they did not perceive it"
