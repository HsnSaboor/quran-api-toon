quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun will cease to shine (overthrown)
  81,2,and when the stars will fall
  81,3,and when the mountains will be moved away
  81,4,and when the pregnant she-camels will be neglected (unattended)
  81,5,and when the wild beasts will be gathered together
  81,6,and when the seas will overflow (or set on fire)
  81,7,and when the souls will be joined (with their bodies)
  81,8,and when the infant girl buried alive (as the pagan Arabs used to do) will be questioned
  81,9,for what sin she was killed
  81,10,and when the written pages (record of deeds) will be laid open
  81,11,and when the heaven will be stripped off (taken away from its place)
  81,12,and when hellfire will be kindled to blaze (fierce heat)
  81,13,and when Paradise will be brought near
  81,14,then every person will know what he has brought (of good and evil)
  81,15,"So surely, I swear by the planets that recede"
  81,16,and that move swiftly and hide themselves
  81,17,and by the night as it departs
  81,18,and by the dawn as it brightens
  81,19,"surely, this is the Word (this Qur’an) of a honorable Messenger (Gabriel from Allah to Muhammad)"
  81,20,"possessor of mighty power, established (high rank) with the Owner of the Throne (Allah)"
  81,21,"obeyed (by the angels in the heaven), and trustworthy"
  81,22,(O people of Makkah) your companion (Muhammad) is not a mad man
  81,23,and indeed he (Muhammad) saw him (Gabriel) in the clear horizon
  81,24,and he (Muhammad) does not withhold knowledge on the unseen
  81,25,And this (Qur’an) is not the word of the outcast Satan
  81,26,Then where are you going
  81,27,This (the Qur’an) is but a reminder to the people of the worlds
  81,28,to whoever among you who wishes to follow the Right Way
  81,29,"Yet, you will not (avail your wishes) unless that Allah wills, the Lord of the worlds"
