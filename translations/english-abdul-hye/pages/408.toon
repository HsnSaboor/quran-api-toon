quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  30,33,"And when a harm touches people, they cry to their Lord, turning to Him in repentance. But when He gives them a taste of His Mercy, behold! a party of them associate (partners in worship) with their Lord"
  30,34,be ungrateful for what We have bestowed on them. Then enjoy (your short life); soon you will come to know
  30,35,"Or have We revealed to them a Scripture, which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him"
  30,36,"And when We cause mankind to taste of Mercy, they rejoice in it, but when an evil afflicts them because of (evil deeds) what their hands have sent forth, then they are in despair"
  30,37,"Don’t they see that Allah enlarges the provision for whom He wills and straitens (for whom He wills). Surely, there are signs for a people who believe"
  30,38,"(O believers) give what is due to your relative, the poor, and the wayfarer. That is best for those who seek the pleasure of Allah and it is they who will be successful"
  30,39,"And that interest which you give in order that it may increase in wealth of other people, does not increase with Allah; but that which you give as obligatory charity seeking the pleasure of Allah, shall have manifold increase"
  30,40,"It is Allah Who has created you, then provides (sustenance) for you, then will cause you to die, then He will give you life (on the Day of Resurrection). Is there any of your partners (of Allah) who can do any of these things? Glory be to Him! Exalted is He above all that evil they associate (with Him)"
  30,41,Evil (sins and disobedience of Allah) has appeared in the land and the sea because of what the hands of people (have earned). He may make them taste a part of that which they have done in order that they may return (from evil)
