  69,10,"and they disobeyed their Lord’s Messenger, so He seized them with a strong seize"
  69,11,"Surely! When the water rose beyond limits (Noah’s flood), We carried you people in the floating ship"
  69,12,that We may make it an event of warning for you so that it may be understood by the retaining ears (in memory)
  69,13,Then when the Trumpet will be blown with one blowing (first one)
  69,14,and the earth with its mountains will be removed (from their places) and crushed with a single crushing
  69,15,then on that Day the great Event will befall
  69,16,"and the heaven will split asunder, and for that Day it (heaven) will be frail and torn up"
  69,17,And the angels will be on all sides and on that Day 8 angels will bear the Throne of your Lord above them

  69,30,"(It will be said): “Seize him and fetter (with a chain around its neck)"
  69,31,then throw him in the blazing fire
  69,32,then fasten him with a chain of 70 cubits long
  69,33,"Surely, he did not believe in Allah, the Great"
  69,34,and did not urge on the feeding of the poor
