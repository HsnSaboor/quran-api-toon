quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,11,"Surely! Those who brought forth the slander (against Aisha, the wife of the Prophet) are a group among you. Consider it is not a bad thing for you but it is a good (lesson) for you. Every person among them (who took part) has earned its sin, and as for the one among them who had the greater share (leading part) in it, shall have a great punishment"
  24,12,"Why then, when you heard it (the slander), did not the believing men and believing women of their own people think good and say: “This (charge) is an obvious lie?”"
  24,13,"Why did they not produce 4 witnesses for it? Since they (the slanderers) have not produced the witnesses, then they are the liars with Allah"
  24,14,"Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His Mercy to you in this world and in the Hereafter, a great punishment would have touched you for what you had spoken"
  24,15,"when you propagated it with your tongues, and uttered with your mouths about which there was no knowledge for you. You took it as a little thing while it was very great (serious offence) with Allah"
  24,16,"And why did you not, when you heard it, say: “It is not right for us to speak of this, glory be to You (O Allah)! This is a great lie.”"
  24,17,"Allah warns you that you never ever repeat (mistake) like this, if you are believers"
  24,18,"Allah has made the Verses clear for you, and Allah is the All-Knower, the All-Wise"
  24,19,"Surely, those who like that (the crime of) slander should be propagated among those who believe, they will have a painful punishment in this world and in the Hereafter. And Allah knows and you don’t know"
  24,20,"And had it not been for the Grace of Allah and His Mercy on you (this slander would have very bad impact). Allah is full of Kindness, Merciful"
