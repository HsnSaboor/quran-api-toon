  9,64,"The hypocrites fear lest a chapter (of the Qur’an) should be revealed about them, showing them what is in their hearts. Say: “(Go ahead and) mock! But certainly Allah will bring to light all that you fear.”"
  9,65,"If you ask them about this, they declare: “We were only talking idly and joking.” Say: “Was it at Allah and His Verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?”"
  9,66,"Make no excuse; indeed you have disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they are criminals"
  9,67,"The hypocrite men and women are from one another. They enjoin evil (disbelief), forbid from good (Islam), and close their hands (not spending in Allah’s Cause). They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them. Surely, the hypocrites are the disobedient"
  9,68,"Allah has promised the hypocrite men and women, the disbelievers, the fire of hell, they shall abide in it. It will be sufficient for them. Allah has cursed them and for them is a lasting punishment"
