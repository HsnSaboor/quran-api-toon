quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Have you seen the one who disbelieved in Our Verses and yet says: “Indeed I will be given wealth and children?”"
  19,78,Has he known the unseen or has he taken a Covenant from the Gracious (Allah)
  19,79,"Nay! We shall record what he says, and We will increase the punishment for him"
  19,80,And We will inherit from him (at death) all that he talks and he shall come to Us alone
  19,81,And they have taken (for worship) deities besides Allah so that they might give honor (source of strength) for them
  19,82,"Nay, but they (false deities) will deny their worship of them, and will turn against them (on the Day of Judgment)"
  19,83,Don’t you see that We have sent the devils to the disbelievers to push them to do evil
  19,84,So don’t make haste against them; We only count out to them a (limited) number
  19,85,The Day We shall gather the pious persons to the Gracious (Allah) like a delegation
  19,86,and We shall drive the sinners to hell in a thirsty state
  19,87,They shall not own (power of) intercession except those who have taken a covenant (permission) from the Gracious (Allah)
  19,88,"And they say: “The Gracious (Allah) has begotten a son,”"
  19,89,indeed you have brought forth a terrible thing
  19,90,"whereby the heavens are almost torn, the earth is split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins"
  19,91,that they ascribe a son to the Gracious (Allah)
  19,92,but it is not suitable for the Gracious (Allah) that He should beget a son
  19,93,There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes to the Gracious (Allah) in full submission
  19,94,"Surely, He knows each of them, and has counted them a full counting (of all the creatures of Allah)"
  19,95,and every one of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection
