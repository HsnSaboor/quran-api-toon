quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,89,"And when there has come to them a book (this Qur’an) from Allah confirming what is with the previous Scriptures, even though previously they were invoking Allah for victory over those who disbelieved, and when what came to them which they recognized, they disbelieved in it. So the curse of Allah is on the disbelievers"
  2,90,"How bad is that (for which) they have sold their own selves, that they should disbelieve in which Allah has revealed (the Qur’an), grudging that Allah should reveal His Grace on whom He wills of His servants! So they have drawn (on themselves) wrath upon wrath. And for the disbelievers, there is a disgraceful punishment"
  2,91,"And when it is said to them: “Believe in what Allah has sent down,” they say: “We believe in what was sent down to us (Torah).” And they disbelieve in that what came after it; while it is the truth confirming what is with them. Ask (O Muhammad): “Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah previously, if you were true believers?”"
  2,92,"And indeed Moses came to you with clear proofs, yet you took (for worship) the calf after he left, and you were wrongdoers"
  2,93,"And (remember) when We took your covenant and raised above you the Mount (Toor) (saying): “Hold firmly to what We have given you and hear (Our Word).” They said: “We have heard and disobeyed.” And their hearts loved (the worship of) the calf because of their disbelief. Say: “Evil is what commands you by your faith if you are believers.”"
