quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  28,60,And whatever you have been given from things are enjoyments and adornments of the worldly life; and that which is with Allah is better and will remain forever. Don’t you have sense
  28,61,"Is it he whom We have promised an excellent Promise (Paradise) which he will find true, be like the one whom We have given to enjoy the luxuries of the worldly life and then on the Day of Resurrection, he will be among those who are brought up (for punishment)"
  28,62,"And (remember) the Day when He will call them and say: “Where are My partners (so-called) whom you used to assert?”"
  28,63,"Those about whom the Word will come true (to be punished), will say: \"Our Lord! These are they whom we led astray. We led them astray, as we were astray ourselves. We declare our innocence before You. It was not us that they worshipped.”"
  28,64,"And it will be said (to them): “Call upon your partners (of Allah).” So they will call upon them but they will not answer to them and they will see the punishment. They will wish if they had been guided"
  28,65,"And (remember) the Day (when Allah) will call them and says: “How did you answer the Messengers?”"
  28,66,The news (of good answer) will be obscured to them on that Day and they will not be able to ask one another
  28,67,"But as for him who repented, believed, and did righteous deeds, then hopefully he will be among those who are successful"
  28,68,"Your Lord creates whatever He wills and chooses. They don’t have any choice. Glory be to Allah, and exalted about all that they associate (as partners with Him)"
  28,69,And your Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they reveal
  28,70,"And He is Allah: there is no one worthy of worship but He. Praise belongs to Him in the first (world) and in the Last (Hereafter). The decision is with Him and to Him you all shall return"
