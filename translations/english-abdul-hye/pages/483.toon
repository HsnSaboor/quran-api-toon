quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  42,1,Ha-Meem
  42,2,Ain-Sinn-Qaf
  42,3,"Thus Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise inspires you (O Muhammad) and to those sent before you"
  42,4,"To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. He is the High, the Great"
  42,5,"The heavens might have almost broken apart from above them (by His glory) while the angels glorify the praises of their Lord and are asking forgiveness for those on the earth. Surely, Allah is indeed the Forgiving, the Merciful"
  42,6,"For those who take others as protectors besides Him, Allah is the protector over them and you (O Muhammad) are not a guardian over them"
  42,7,Thus We have revealed to you (O Muhammad) this Qur’an in Arabic so that you may warn the residents of the mother town (Makkah) and whoever is around it. Warn them of the Day of assembling; there is no doubt about it; when a group (believers) will go to Paradise and a group (disbelievers) in the blazing fire
  42,8,"If Allah had willed, He could have made them one nation, but He admits whom He wills to His Mercy. The wrongdoers will not have any protector or a helper"
  42,9,Or have they taken guardians besides Him? But Allah alone is the Protector. He is the one Who gives life to the dead and it is He Who has power over all things
  42,10,"In whatever matter you differ, its decision is with Allah. (Say O Muhammad to the polytheists): Such is Allah, my Lord in whom I have put my trust, and to Him I turn in repentance"
