  54,7,They will come out from their graves with their humbled eyes as if they were locusts spread abroad
  54,8,"rushing towards the caller and disbelievers will say: “This is a hard Day.”"
  54,9,"The people of Noah denied (their Messenger) before them. They rejected Our servant and said: “A madman!” and he was rudely rebuked and threatened"

  54,11,So We opened the gates of heaven with water (rain) pouring out
  54,12,and We caused the earth to gush out with springs. So the waters met for a matter predestined
  54,13,And We carried him on (a ship) built with planks and nails
  54,14,"floating under Our care, a reward for him (Noah) who was rejected (by disbelievers)"
  54,15,"And indeed, We have left this (ship) as a sign, so is there any who will remember (or take admonition)"
  54,16,Then how terrible was My punishment and My warnings
  54,17,"And We have indeed made the Qur’an easy to understand and remember, and is there any who will remember (or take admonition)"
