quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,30,On the Day when every one will be confronted with what they have done of good and what they have done of evil. (Wrongdoers) will wish if (there were) indeed a great distance between them and their evil deeds. Allah warns you of His punishment and Allah is very kind to (His) devotees
  3,31,"Say (O Muhammad): “If you love Allah then follow me (the Qur’an and your way of life), Allah will love you and forgive your sins. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.”"
  3,32,"Say (O Muhammad): “Obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad).” If they turn away, then indeed Allah does not like the disbelievers"
  3,33,"Surely Allah chose Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of Imran above mankind"
  3,34,"They were offspring of one another. Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower"
  3,35,"(Remember) when the wife of Imran said: “O my Lord! I have vowed to You what is in my womb to be dedicated for Your services. So accept this from me. Surely, You are All-Hearer, All-Knower.”"
  3,36,"When she delivered her (Mary), she said: “My Lord! I have delivered a female (instead of male).” Allah knew better what she delivered: “The male is not like the female, and I have named her Mary, and I seek refuge for her with You and her offspring from Satan, the rejected.”"
  3,37,"So her Lord accepted her with right acceptance. He made her grow in good manner and put her in the care of Zachariah. Whenever Zachariah entered to see her at her praying place, he found her with food. He said: “O Mary! From where you got this?” She said: “This is from Allah. Surely, Allah provides sustenance to whom He wills, without limit.”"
