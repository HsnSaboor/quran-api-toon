quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,28,"Keep yourself (O Muhammad) patiently with those who call their Lord in the morning and the evening seeking His pleasure, and don’t let your eyes overlook them desiring the beauty of the life of the world; don’t obey the one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who follows own lusts and whose affair has been lost"
  18,29,"(O Muhammad) say: “The truth is from your Lord. Whoever wills let him believe, and whoever wills, let him disbelieve.” Surely, We have prepared a fire for the wrongdoers; its walls will surround them (disbelievers). If they ask for help, they will be granted water like boiling oil that will burn faces. Terrible is the drink and evil is the resting place"
  18,30,"Surely! Those who believe and do righteous deeds, We shall not lose the reward of him who does good deeds"
  18,31,"Those are the ones for them there will be gardens of Eden; rivers flow beneath them; they will be decorated therein with bracelets of gold, and they will wear green garments of fine and thick silk. They will recline therein on raised thrones. How good is the reward, and how excellent is the resting place"
  18,32,"And (O Muhammad) put forward to them the example of 2 men: We had given 2 gardens of grapes to one of them, We had surrounded them with date-palms, and had made cultivated fields between them"
  18,33,Both the gardens brought forth their produce and did not fail in the least. We (even) caused a river to gush forth in the middle of them
  18,34,"And there was abundant produce for him and he said to his companion while he was talking to him: “I have more wealth than you and stronger (in respect of) men.”"
