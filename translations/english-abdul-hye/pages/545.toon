quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  58,22,"You (O Muhammad) will never find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day on friendly terms with those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), even though they are their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their kindred (people). For such He has written faith in their hearts and has strengthened them with spirit (true guidance) from Himself. And He will admit them to Gardens (Paradise) under which rivers flow, to reside in it forever. Allah will be pleased with them, and they will be pleased with Him. They are the party of Allah. Lo! Surely it is the party of Allah that will be the successful"
  59,1,"Glorifies Allah whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Allah is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise"
  59,2,"It is He Who drove out those who disbelieve from the people of the Scripture (the Jews of Bani An-Nadheer) from their homes at the first gathering. You did not think that they would ever get out. They thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah! But Allah’s (punishment) reached them from a place where from they did not expect it, and He cast fear into their hearts, so that they destroyed their own homes with their own hands and by the hands of the believers. So take admonition, O you with eyes (to see)"
  59,3,"And had it not been that Allah had decreed exile for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world, and in the Hereafter they shall have the punishment of the fire"
