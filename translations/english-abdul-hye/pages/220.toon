quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,98,"Was there any town that believed (after seeing the punishment), and their faith benefited them (from the punishment) except the people of Jonah? When they believed, We removed from them the punishment of disgrace in the life of the world, and permitted them to enjoy for a while"
  10,99,"If your Lord had willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you (O Muhammad) then compel mankind until they become believers"

  10,102,"Then do they wait for (anything) except (for destruction) like the days of those who passed away before them? Say: “So wait, I too will wait with you.”"

  10,104,"Say (O Muhammad): “O you mankind! If you are in doubt as to my religion (Islam), then I will never worship those whom you worship besides Allah. But I worship Allah Who causes you to die, and I am commanded to be one of the believers.”"
  10,105,"And (it is revealed to me): “Direct entirely yourself (O Muhammad) towards the religion upright, and you never be one of the polytheists"
  10,106,"Don’t invoke besides Allah, who can neither benefit nor harm you, but if you do so, surely you will then be of the wrongdoers"
