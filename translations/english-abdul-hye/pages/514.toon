quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  48,24,"And it is He Who has restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makkah (through the peace treaty of Hudaibiyah), after that He had made you victors over them. And Allah is the All-Seer of what you do"
  48,25,"They are the ones who disbelieved and obstructed you from the sacred Masjid (of Makkah) and detained the sacrificed animals from reaching their place of sacrifice. Had there not been believing men and believing women (in Makkah) whom you did not know, and you may trample (heavily burst) them under your feet and thus incurring a sin committed by you without your knowledge (but Allah held back your hands), so that Allah may admit to His Mercy whom He wills. If they (believers and disbelievers) should have been apart, We would have punished those of them who disbelieved with painful punishment"
  48,26,"When those who disbelieve had put in their hearts pride and arrogance, the pride and arrogance of the time of ignorance, then Allah sent down His Tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers, and made them stick to the word of piety, and they were well entitled to it and worthy of it. And Allah is the All-Knower of everything"
  48,27,"Indeed Allah will fulfill His Messenger’s true vision (which Allah showed him) in all truth. Certainly, you shall enter the sacred Masjid; if Allah wills, secure (to perform Umrah) having your heads shaved, and having your head hair cut short, having no fear. He knows what you don’t know, and besides He granted a near victory"
  48,28,"It is He Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islam), so that He may make it (Islam) superior over all other religions. And Allah is All-Sufficient as a Witness"
