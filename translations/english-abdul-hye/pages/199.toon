quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,73,"O Prophet (Muhammad)! Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm against them, their abode is hell, and worst indeed is the destination"
  9,74,"They swear by Allah that they did not say (bad), but really they said the word of disbelief, and they disbelieved after accepting Islam. They resolved (plot to murder Prophet Muhammad) which they were unable to carry out. They could not find (any cause to do so) except that Allah and His Messenger had enriched them of His Bounty. If they repent, it will be better for them, but if they turn away, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. There is none for them on earth as a protector or a helper"
  9,75,"And of them are some who made a covenant with Allah (saying): “If He bestowed on us His Bounty, we will surely give charity and will be certainly among those who are righteous.”"
  9,76,"Then when He gave them His Bounty, they became stingy with it, turned away, and they were reluctant"
  9,77,"So He punished them by putting hypocrisy into their hearts till the Day when they shall meet Him, because they broke (the covenant with Allah) which they had promised and because they used to tell lies"
  9,78,"Don’t they know that Allah knows their secret ideas, and their secret talk, and that Allah is the All-Knower of the unseen"
  9,79,"Those who defame the believers who give charity voluntarily and those who could not find (to give charity) except what is available to them, so they mock at them (believers). Allah will throw back their mockery on them, and they shall have a painful punishment"
