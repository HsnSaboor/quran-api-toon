quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  12,31,"So when she heard about their accusation, she invited them, and prepared a banquet for them; and she gave each one of them a knife (to cut fruit). (When they were ready to cut) she asked (Joseph): “Come out before them.” When they saw him, they exalted him (at his beauty) and (to their surprise) cut their hands. They exclaimed: “Allah forbid! This is not a man! This is none but a noble angel!”"
  12,32,"She said: “This is he (young man) about whom you did blame me. Indeed I sought to seduce him, but he refused. Now if he does not do what I order him, he will certainly be cast into prison, and will be one of those who are disgraced.”"
  12,33,"He (Joseph) said: \"O my Lord! Prison is dearer to me than what they invite me to it. Unless You turn away their plot from me, I may feel inclined towards them and be one of the ignorant.”"
  12,34,"So his Lord answered his prayer and turned away their plot from him. Surely, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower"
  12,35,Then it appeared to them after they had seen the proofs (of his innocence) to imprison him for a while
  12,36,"And there entered with him 2 young men in the prison. One of them said: “Surely, I saw myself (in a dream) pressing wine.” The other said: “Surely, I saw myself (in a dream) carrying bread on my head and birds were eating from it.” (They said): “Tell us the interpretation of these dreams. Surely, we think you (are one) of the righteous people.”"
  12,37,"He (Joseph) replied: “No food will come to you as your provision, but I will inform you of its interpretation before it (the food) comes to you. This is what my Lord has taught me. Surely, I have abandoned the religion of those people who don’t believe in Allah and they are disbelievers in the Hereafter"
