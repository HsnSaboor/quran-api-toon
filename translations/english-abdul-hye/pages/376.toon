quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,all that which their past enjoyment be to them
  26,208,And We never destroyed a township without sending its warners
  26,209,"by way of reminder (in advance), and We have never been unjust"
  26,210,And it is not the devils who have brought it (this Qur’an) down
  26,211,"neither it would suit them, nor they can produce it"
  26,212,"Surely, they have been removed far from hearing it"
  26,213,So don’t invoke with Allah another one worthy of worship lest you be among those who receive punishment
  26,214,And warn your tribe (O Muhammad) of near relatives
  26,215,and lower or put down your wing (be kind and humble) to those of the believers who follow you
  26,216,"if they disobey you, say: “Verily, I am not responsible for what you do.”"
  26,217,"And put your trust in the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,218,Who sees you (O Muhammad) when you stand up (at night in prayers)
  26,219,and see your movements among those who fall prostrate
  26,220,"Surely! He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower"
  26,221,Shall I inform you (O people!) upon whom the devils descend
  26,222,"They descend on every liar, sinner"
  26,223,"who gives ear (to the devils), most of them are liars"
  26,224,"as for the poets, the erring ones follow them"
  26,225,Don’t you see how aimlessly they wander in every valley
  26,226,and say what they don’t do
  26,227,"Except those who believe, do righteous deeds, remember Allah much, and vindicate themselves after they have wronged. Those who do wrong (will know) what overturning they will be overturned"
