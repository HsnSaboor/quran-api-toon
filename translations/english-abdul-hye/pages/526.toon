quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star when it goes down (vanishes)
  53,2,your companion (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor misguided
  53,3,nor does he speak of (his own) desire
  53,4,It is only a revelation that is revealed
  53,5,He (Muhammad) has been taught (this Qur’an) by one mighty in power (angel Gabriel)
  53,6,the one free from any defect who rose and became stable (in view)
  53,7,While he (Gabriel) was in the highest part of the horizon
  53,8,then he (Gabriel) approached and came closer
  53,9,and was at a distance of 2 bow’s length or even closer
  53,10,so he (Gabriel) conveyed the revelation to His servant (Muhammad) what he was supposed to reveal
  53,11,(The prophet’s) heart did not deny what he (Muhammad) saw
  53,12,Will you (disbelievers) then dispute with him (Muhammad) about what he saw (during his ascent journey over the 7 heavens)
  53,13,Indeed he (Muhammad) saw him (Gabriel) another descent time
  53,14,"near Sidra-tul-Muntaha (the lote-tree at the farthest end of the 7th heavens, beyond which none can cross)"
  53,15,Near it is Jannatul-M’awa (the rest-house of Paradise)
  53,16,When that lote-tree was covered with what covered it
  53,17,"the sight (of Muhammad) did not turn aside (right or left), nor it transgressed beyond limit"
  53,18,Indeed he (Muhammad) did see some of the greatest signs of his Lord
  53,19,"Have you then considered Lat, Uzza (2 idols of the pagan Arabs)"
  53,20,"and another idol (Manat of the pagan Arabs), the other 3rd (as the daughters of Allah)"
  53,21,Is it for you the sons and for Him the daughters
  53,22,This indeed is a division most unfair
  53,23,"They (Lat, Uzza, Manat) are nothing but names which you and your forefathers have named, for Allah has not sent down any authority in them. They (disbelievers) follow nothing but a guess which is their soul’s desire, even though the guidance has come to them from their Lord"
  53,24,Or should human have whatever he wishes
  53,25,But to Allah belong the last (Hereafter) and the first (the world)
  53,26,How many angels are there in the heavens; yet their intercession can avail nothing except what Allah gives permission for whom He wills and pleases
