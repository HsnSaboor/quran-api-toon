quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  12,70,"So when he (Joseph) had furnished them with their provisions, he put the (golden) bowl into his brother’s bag, then a crier cried: “O you in the caravan! Surely, you are thieves!”"
  12,71,"They said turning towards them: “What is it that you have lost?”"
  12,72,"They said: “We have lost the (golden) bowl of the king and for him who produces it (is the reward of) a load of camel; and I will be bound by it.”"
  12,73,"They said: “By Allah! Indeed you know that we came not to make mischief in the land, and we are not thieves!”"
  12,74,"They (Joseph’s people) said: “What then should be the penalty of him, if you are liars?”"
  12,75,"They (Joseph’s brothers) replied: “His penalty should be he, in whose bag it is found, and then it is his punishment. Thus we punish the wrongdoers!”"
  12,76,"So he (Joseph) began to search their bags before the bag of his brother (Benjamin). Then he brought it out of his brother’s bag. Thus We did plan for Joseph. He could not take his brother by the law of the king, except that Allah willed it. We raise to degrees whom We will, but over all those endowed with knowledge is the All-knower (Allah)"
  12,77,"They (Joseph’s brothers) said: “If he steals, surely, a brother of his (Joseph) did steal before him.” But these things Joseph did keep in himself, not revealing (the secrets) to them. He said: “You are in worst case. Allah is the Best Knower of the truth what you assert!”"
  12,78,"They said: “O mighty one! Surely, he (Benjamin) has a very old father (who will grieve for him); so take one of us in his place. Indeed we think you are one of the righteous people.”"
