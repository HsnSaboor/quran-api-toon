quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  8,34,"And what is with them that Allah should not punish them while they stop people from the Sacred Masjid (at Makkah), and they are not its guardians? None can be its guardians except the pious, but most of them don’t know"
  8,35,Their prayer at the House (the Ka’bah at Makkah) is nothing but whistling and hand-clapping. So taste the punishment for what you used to disbelieve
  8,36,"Surely, those who disbelieve, they spend their wealth to hinder people from the way of Allah. They will keep on spending; and then it will become anguish for them. Then they will be defeated. And those who disbelieve, (in the Hereafter) they will be gathered to hell"
  8,37,"in order that Allah may distinguish the wicked (disbelievers, evil-doers) from the good (believers with righteous deeds). Allah will put the wicked one upon another, will pile them all, and will cast them into hell. Those are they who are the losers"
  8,38,"Say (O Muhammad) to those who have disbelieved, if they desist (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven. But if they revert, then let them precede the examples of the ancients (as a warning)"
  8,39,"And (O believers) fight them until there is no more mischief and the religion (Islam) is established completely for Allah alone. But if they cease (worshipping others besides Allah), then surely, Allah is All-Seer of what they do"
  8,40,"And if they turn away, then know that Allah is your Protector, an excellent Protector, and an Excellent Helper"
