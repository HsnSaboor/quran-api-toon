quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the heaven and the night-comer (the bright star)
  86,2,and what will make you know what night-comer is
  86,3,(It is) the star of piercing brightness
  86,4,There is no human being but has a protector (angel) over him
  86,5,So let a person see from what he is created
  86,6,He is created from an emitted fluid
  86,7,that is produced from between the back-bone and the ribs
  86,8,"Surely, (Allah) is Able to bring a person back (to life)"
  86,9,on the Day when all the secrets will be examined
  86,10,"he will have neither power, nor any helper (to save from punishment)"
  86,11,By the sky (with rain clouds) with the returning rain (again and again)
  86,12,and by the earth which splits (for springs or growth of trees and plants)
  86,13,surely! this (Qur’an) is the Word that separates (truth from falsehood)
  86,14,and it is not for amusement
  86,15,These (unbelievers) are plotting a plot (against you O Muhammad)
  86,16,and I too am plotting a plan
  86,17,Give respite to the disbelievers. Give respite to them gently (for a while)
  87,1,"Glorify the name of your Lord, the High"
  87,2,"Who has created everything, and then proportioned them"
  87,3,Who has measured (destinies) and then guided them
  87,4,Who brings out the pasture (vegetation eaten by animals)
  87,5,then makes it dark rubbish
  87,6,We shall make you recite (the Qur’an) so you (O Muhammad) shall not forget it
  87,7,except what Allah wills. Surely He knows what is open and what is hidden
  87,8,And We shall make it easy for you (O Muhammad) to follow the easy way (to do righteous deeds)
  87,9,"Therefore remind, surely, reminder does benefit"
  87,10,Whoever fears (Allah) will heed the reminder
  87,11,and the wretched will avoid it
  87,12,who will burn in the great fire
  87,13,where he will neither die in it nor live (a good living)
  87,14,Indeed whoever purifies himself shall achieve success
  87,15,and who remembers the Name of his Lord and prays
