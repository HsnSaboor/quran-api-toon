quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you? How do you decide
  37,155,Will you not then remember
  37,156,Or is there any plain authority for you
  37,157,Then bring your book if you are truthful
  37,158,"They have invented a kinship between Him and the jinns, but indeed the jinns know quite well that they will be brought for account (before Allah)"
  37,159,Glory be to Allah! (He is free) from what they attribute to Him
  37,160,except the chosen (faithful) devotees of Allah
  37,161,"So, neither you nor those whom you worship (idols)"
  37,162,can lead (anyone) astray
  37,163,except those who are destined to burn in hell
  37,164,"(The angels say): “There is one known place for us"
  37,165,"Surely, we stand in rows (for prayers)"
  37,166,"surely, we are those who glorify (Allah).”"
  37,167,Indeed they (disbelievers) used to say
  37,168,“If we had a reminder like the people of old received (before the coming of Muhammad)
  37,169,we would have indeed been the chosen devotees of Allah!”
  37,170,"But (since the Qur’an has come) they disbelieve in it (the Qur’an), and they will come to know (the consequence soon)"
  37,171,"Surely, Our Word has gone forth for Our devotees, the Messengers"
  37,172,that surely they would be victorious
  37,173,"and verily, Our hosts (soldiers) will be victorious"
  37,174,So turn away (O Muhammad) from them for a while
  37,175,"and watch them, and they shall see (your victory)"
  37,176,Do they seek to hasten on Our Punishment
  37,177,"Then, when it descends into their court-yard (near them), then evil will be the morning for those who had been warned"
  37,178,So turn (O Muhammad) away from them for a while
  37,179,and watch (their downfall) and they shall see (your victory)
  37,180,"Glory be to your Lord, the Lord of honor and power, (He is free) from what they attribute to Him"
  37,181,Peace be upon the Messengers
  37,182,"and all the praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds"
