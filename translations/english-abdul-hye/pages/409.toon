quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  30,42,"Say (O Muhammad): “Travel in the land and see how was the end of those before you! Most of them were polytheists.”"
  30,43,So you (O Muhammad) set your face to the right religion before there comes a Day from Allah which none can avert it. On that Day they (people) shall be divided (in 2 groups - a group in Paradise and a group in hell)
  30,44,"Those who disbelieved will suffer from their disbelief, and those who have done righteous deeds will prepare a good place (in Paradise) for themselves"
  30,45,"so that He may reward those who believe and do righteous deeds, out of His Bounty. Surely, He does not like the disbelievers"
  30,46,"And among His Signs is that He sends the winds as glad tidings, give you a taste of His Mercy, the ships may sail at His Command, and that you may seek of His Bounty, in order that you may be thankful"
  30,47,And indeed We did send Messengers before you (O Muhammad) to their own people. They came to them with clear proofs. Then We took revenge on those who committed crimes and it was incumbent upon Us to help the believers
  30,48,"It is Allah Who sends the winds to raise the clouds, then spreads them in the sky as He wills, then breaks them into fragments, until you see (rain) drops come forth from their midst! And when He makes them fall with it on whom He wills of His servants, lo! They rejoice"
  30,49,"surely before that (rain) is sent down upon them, they were in despair"
  30,50,"Look at the effects of Mercy of Allah, how He revives (gives life) the earth after its death. Surely! That is He who will raise the dead (on the Day of Resurrection), and He is Able (has power) on every thing"
