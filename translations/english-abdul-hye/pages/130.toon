quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Say (O Muhammad): “What thing is greatest in evidence?” Say: “Allah is a witness between me and between you; and this Qur’an is revealed to me so that I may warn you with it and whoever it may reach. Do you surely bear witness that besides Allah there are others worthy of worship?” Say: “I don’t bear such a witness!” Say: “Allah is only the one worthy of worship. Indeed I am innocent of what you associate (with Allah).”"
  6,20,Those whom We have given the Scripture recognize him (Muhammad) as they recognize their sons. But those who lost their own selves will not believe
  6,21,"And who is greater wrongdoer than he who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Verses? Surely, the wrongdoers will not attain success"
  6,22,"On the Day when We shall gather them all together, We shall say to those who associated others (with Allah): “Where are your associates (false deities) to whom you used to assert?”"
  6,23,"They will not have arguments but will say: “By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheists.”"
  6,24,Look! How they lie against themselves! The lie will leave them what they invented
  6,25,"Among them there are those who (pretend that they) listen to you; but We have cast veils over their hearts, and deafness in their ears, so they can not understand it. Even if they see every sign, they will not believe in it. So much so that when they come to you, they argue with you. The disbelievers say: “This is not but tales of the ancients.”"
  6,26,And they forbid others from him (Muhammad) and they themselves keep away from him. They destroy not but their own selves and they don’t perceive it
  6,27,"If you could see when they will be held over the fire! They will say: “We wish we were sent back (to the world), then we would not deny the Verse of our Lord, and we would be among the believers!”"
