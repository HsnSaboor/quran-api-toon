quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,90,O you who believe! Only intoxicants and game of chance (gambling) and sacrifices at altars (tribute to idols) and dividing arrows (lottery) are an abomination of handiworks of Satan. So avoid them so that you may attain success
  5,91,"Satan only wants to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from the prayer. So, will you be of those who abstain"
  5,92,"And obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and be aware. But if you turn away, then you should know that it is the duty only upon our Messenger to convey clearly"
  5,93,"Those who believe and do righteous deeds, there is no sin for what they ate (in the past), if they fear Allah, believe, and do righteous deeds, then again they fear Allah and believe, and then (once again) they fear Allah and do good deeds (with perfection). Allah loves the righteous people"
  5,94,"O you who believe! Allah will surely try you with something of the game which can be taken by your hands and your lances, so that Allah knows who fears Him unseen. Then whoever transgresses after that, there is a painful punishment"
  5,95,"O you who believe! You don’t kill game when you are in a state of Ihram (for Pilgrimage). Whoever of you kills it intentionally, then penalty is like what was killed of cattle judged by 2 just men among you, an offering brought to the Ka’bah; or for expiation, feeding of needy or to that equivalent fasting so as to taste and grieve (punishment) of the deed. Allah has pardoned what is passed. But whoever repeats it, Allah will take retribution on him. Allah is All-Mighty, Lord of retribution"
