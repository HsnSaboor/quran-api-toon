quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,181,"Indeed, Allah has heard the saying of those who say: “Truly, Allah is poor and we are rich!” We shall record what they have said, their killing of the prophets unjustly, and We shall say: “Taste the punishment of the burning fire"
  3,182,That is for that (evil) which your hands have sent before you. Allah is never unjust to (His) servants.”
  3,183,"They (disbelievers) say: “Surely, Allah has taken our promise not to believe in any Messenger until he brings to us an offering which will consume the fire (from heaven).” Say: “Surely, Messengers have come to you before me with clear signs and even with what you are asking of.

  3,184,"If they reject you (O Muhammad), so were Messengers rejected before you, who came with clear signs and the Scripture, and the book of Enlightenment"
  3,185,"Everyone shall taste death. Only you shall be paid your reward on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is removed away from the fire and is admitted to Paradise, will indeed be successful. The life of this world is nothing except enjoyment of deception"

If you remain patient and become pious, then surely, that will be a proof of your firm determination"
