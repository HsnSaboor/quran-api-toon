  17,88,"Say: “If the mankind and the jinns together were to bring the like of this Qur’an, they could not bring the like thereof, even if some of them was helper to some others.”"

  17,90,"And they say: “We shall not believe in you (O Muhammad) until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us"
  17,91,or there is a garden of date-palms and grapes for you and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst abundantly
  17,92,"or you cause to fall the heaven upon us in pieces as you have claimed, or you bring Allah and the angels (face to face) before us"
  17,93,"or there is a house of adorable materials (like silver and gold) for you, or you ascend up into the sky, and we shall not believe in your ascension until you bring down for us a book that we would read.” Say (O Muhammad): “Glory be to my Lord! Am I (claimed) anything more but a human, sent as a Messenger?”"
