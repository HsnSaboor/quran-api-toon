  28,52,"Those to whom We gave Scriptures before it, they believe in it (the Qur’an)"
  28,53,"And when it is recited to them, they say: “We believe in it. Surely, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed we were from those who submit to Allah (as Muslims) before it (like Abdullah bin Salam, Salman Al-Farsi).”"
