  42,32,Among His signs are the ships like mountains in the sea
  42,33,"If He wills, He can cause the wind to settle and then they would become motionless on the back (of the sea). Surely, in this example there are signs for everyone (who is) patient and grateful"

  42,35,Those who (polytheists) dispute about Our revelations should know that there is no place of refuge (from Allah’s punishment) for them
  42,36,"Whatever you are given is nothing but a passing enjoyment for this worldly life. What is with Allah (Paradise) is better and more lasting for those who believe, put their trust in their Lord"
