  22,6,"This is because Allah is the Truth, it is He Who gives life to the dead, and it is He Who is Able to do all things"
  22,7,"And surely, the Hour (of Judgment) is coming, there is no doubt about it, and Allah will resurrect those who are in the graves"
  22,8,"Among people there are those who dispute about Allah, though they have neither knowledge nor guidance, nor a book giving light (from Allah)"
  22,9,"bending things to mislead others from the Way of Allah. For such persons, there is disgrace in this world and We shall make them taste the punishment of burning (fire) on the Day of Resurrection"
  22,10,that is because of what their hands have sent forth. Surely Allah is not unjust to (His) worshippers
  22,11,"And among people there are those who worship Allah on the very edge (in doubt). If good befalls him, he is content with it; but if a trial befalls on him, then he turns back on its face (reverts back to disbelief after embracing Islam), thus loses both this world and the Hereafter. That is a clear loss"
  22,12,"Then he calls (other deities) besides Allah which neither hurt, nor profit. That is a deviation far away (from the Right Way)"

  22,14,"Truly, Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds, to the gardens with rivers flow underneath them (Paradise). Surely, Allah does what He wills"
  22,15,"Whoever thinks that Allah will not help him (Muhammad) in this world and in the Hereafter, let them stretch out a rope to the ceiling (sky) and then let them strangle themselves. Then let them see whether their plan will remove what they rage"
