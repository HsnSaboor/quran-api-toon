quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"And if We send a wind and they see (their crops) turn yellow, behold, then they disbelieve (more) after it"
  30,52,"So surely you (O Muhammad) can neither make the dead to hear, nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they (disbelievers) turn their backs and turn away"
  30,53,nor you can guide the blind from their straying. None will hear you except those who believe in Our Signs and submit to Allah in Islam (as Muslims)
  30,54,"It is Allah Who has created you in weakness (as a baby), then gave you strength after weakness (in youth), then gave after strength weakness and grey hair (in old age). He creates what He wills. And He is All-Knower, the All-Mighty"
  30,55,"On the Day when the Hour (of Judgment) will be established, the criminals will swear that they did not stay (in the world) but an Hour, thus they are ever deluded (away from truth)"
  30,56,"And those who are bestowed with knowledge and faith will say: “Indeed you have stayed in the decree of Allah, until the Day of Resurrection, so this is the Day of Resurrection, but you did not know.”"
  30,57,"So on that Day, no excuse of theirs will benefit those who did wrong nor will they be allowed to return to seek Allah’s pleasure"
  30,58,"Indeed We have set forth every example for mankind in this Qur’an. But if you (O Muhammad) bring any sign to them, those who disbelieve will say (to the believers): “Surely you are nothing but preaching falsehood.”"
  30,59,Thus Allah has set a seal on the hearts of those who don’t know
  30,60,"So be patient (O Muhammad). Surely, the Promise of Allah is true, and let not those who have no certainty of faith discourage you (from conveying Allah’s message)"
