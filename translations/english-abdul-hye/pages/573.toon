quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,"And surely, there are some among us who are Muslims and some who are deviators from the truth. Those who have embraced Islam have found the Right Way"
  72,15,"as for the unjust deviators (from truth), they will be firewood for hell.”"
  72,16,"Say (O Muhammad): “If they (the Makkans) had stood upright on the Right Way (Islam), We would surely have bestowed on them water (rain) in abundance"
  72,17,"so that We might test them thereby. And those who turn away from the reminder of their Lord (this Qur’an), He will cause them to enter in a severe punishment (hell)"
  72,18,"And the Masjids are built for Allah’s worship alone, so don’t invoke anyone along with Allah"
  72,19,"And yet, when the servant of Allah (Muhammad) stood up invoking Him in prayer, they (the jinns) just were around him in a dense crowd (to listen to the Prophet’s recitation).”"
  72,20,"Say (O Muhammad): “I only pray to my Lord, and I associate none as partners with Him.”"
  72,21,"Say: “Surely I don’t have power to cause you harm, nor bring you the Right Way.”"
  72,22,"Say (O Muhammad): “(If I were to disobey Him) none can protect me from Allah’s punishment, nor can I find refuge except in Him"
  72,23,"(My mission is) only to convey the truth from Allah and His Messages. Those who disobey Allah and His Messenger, then surely, they will be put in the fire of hell to reside in it forever.”"
  72,24,"Till, when they will see (the punishment) that which they are Promised, then they will know whose helpers are weak and whose (supporters) are less in numbers"
  72,25,"Say (O Muhammad): “I don’t know whether (punishment) which you are Promised is near or whether my Lord has appointed for it a distant term"
  72,26,"(He alone is) the All-Knower of the unseen, and He does not reveal His unseen to anyone"
  72,27,except to the Messenger whom He has chosen. Then He makes a band of watching guards (angels) to march before him and behind him
  72,28,so that He may know that surely they (the Messengers) have conveyed the messages of their Lord. And He surrounds all their surroundings and He keeps a count of all things.”
