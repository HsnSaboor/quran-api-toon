quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  20,65,"They said: “O Moses! Either you throw first or we are the first who will throw?”"
  20,66,"(Moses) said: “Nay, you throw (first)!” Then behold! their ropes and their sticks appeared to him (Moses) as though they moved fast by their magic"
  20,67,so Moses conceived a fear in himself
  20,68,"We (Allah) said: “You don’t fear! Surely, you will have the upper hand"
  20,69,"And throw that which is in your right hand! It will swallow up all that they have made. They have made only trick of a magician, and the magician will never be successful no matter whatever (amount of skill) he may possess.”"
  20,70,"(When all were swallowed up by the serpent of Moses) the magicians fell down in prostration. They said: “We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.”"
  20,71,"Pharaoh said: “How do you believe in him (Moses) before I give permission to you? Surely, he is your chief who taught you the magic. So surely I will cut off your hands and your feet from opposite sides, surely I will crucify you on the trunks of date-palms, then surely you will know which of us (Pharaoh or the Lord of Moses, Allah) is more severe in punishment and more lasting.”"
  20,72,"They said: “We never prefer you over what has come to us from the clear signs and to Him who created us. So you decree whatever you wish to decree, you can only decree about this worldly life"
  20,73,Surely! We have believed in our Lord so that He may forgive us our faults and from the magic which you did compel on us. And Allah is better and lasting.”
  20,74,"Surely! Whoever comes to its Lord as a sinner, then surely hell is for him who will neither die nor live in it"
  20,75,"But whoever will come to Him as a believer and has done righteous deeds, for such are the high ranks"
  20,76,"gardens of Eden with rivers flowing under them, they will abide in it forever, such is the reward of those who purify themselves (from evil)"
