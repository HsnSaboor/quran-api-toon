quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,54,"And if every person who has wronged possessed all that is on the earth, would be willing to offer it in ransom (to redeem oneself, but it will not be accepted). They will regret in their hearts when they see the punishment. It will be judged (between them) with justice, and no wrong will be done to them"
  10,55,"No doubt, surely, all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah. No doubt, surely, Allah’s Promise is true, yet, most of them don’t know"
  10,56,"It is He Who gives life, and causes death, and to Him you all shall return"
  10,57,"O mankind! Surely a good advice has come to you from your Lord, a cure for that (disease) is in your hearts, guidance, and a Mercy for the believers"
  10,58,"Say: “In the Bounty of Allah, and in His Mercy (for this Qur’an), so let them rejoice in it. That is better than what (worldly wealth) they collect.”"
  10,59,"Say (O Muhammad to these polytheists): “Have you seen what provision Allah has sent down to you! You have made (some) of it lawful and (others) unlawful.” Say (O Muhammad): “Did Allah permit you, or do you invent a lie against Allah?”"
  10,60,"And what (punishment) do you think for those who invent lies against Allah, on the Day of Resurrection? Truly, Allah is full of Bounty to mankind, but most of them are not grateful"
  10,61,"Whatever you may be engaged in, whatever you may be reciting from the Qur’an, and whatever deeds you may be doing, We are witness over you when you are doing it. Nothing is hidden from your Lord even the weight of an atom on the earth or in the heaven. Neither anything smaller than that nor larger, but is written in a Clear Record"
