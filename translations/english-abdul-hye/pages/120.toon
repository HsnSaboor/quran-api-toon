quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,71,"They thought that there will be no trial, so they became blind and deaf; then Allah turned to them (with forgiveness); but again many of them became blind and deaf. And Allah is All-Seer of what they do"
  5,72,"Surely, those who disbelieved, say: “Indeed Allah is the Messiah (Jesus), son of Mary.” But the Messiah (Jesus) said: “O children of Israel! You worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.” Surely, whoever sets partners with Allah, then indeed Allah has forbidden Paradise, and its abode will be the fire. There are no helpers for the wrongdoers"
  5,73,"Surely, those who disbelieved said: “Indeed Allah is 3rd of 3 (in Trinity).” But there is no one worthy of worship except One (Allah). If they don’t cease from what they say, surely a painful punishment will befall those who disbelieve among them"
  5,74,"Will not then they turn (in repentance) to Allah and ask for His forgiveness? Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  5,75,"The Messiah (Jesus), son of Mary, is not except a Messenger. Certainly the Messengers have passed away before him. His mother (Mary) was a woman of truth. They both used to eat the food (as any other human). See how We make the Verses clear to them and see how they are deceived away (from the truth)"
  5,76,"Say (O Muhammad): “Do you worship besides Allah something which has neither power for your harm nor for your benefit? Indeed, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.”"
