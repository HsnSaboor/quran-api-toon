  43,63,"When Jesus came with (Our) clear signs, he said: “Surely I have come to you with wisdom (Prophethood), and to clarify to you some of the points in which you differ, therefore fear Allah and obey me"
  43,64,"Surely, it is He Who is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him (alone). This is the Right Way.”"
