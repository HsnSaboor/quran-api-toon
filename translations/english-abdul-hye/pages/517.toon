quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  49,12,"O you who believe! Avoid much of suspicions, indeed some suspicions are sins. Don’t spy, nor backbite some of you to others. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of its dead brother? You would hate it. Fear Allah. Surely, Allah is the one who Accepts repentance, Merciful"
  49,13,"O mankind! Surely We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another. Surely, the most honorable of you with Allah is the most pious of you. Surely, Allah is All-Knower, All-Aware"
  49,14,"The Bedouins say: \"We believe.\" Say: \"You don’t believe but you only say, we have submitted (in Islam), for the faith has not yet entered into your hearts. But if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not decrease anything in reward for your deeds. Surely, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  49,15,"Only those are the believers who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and afterward don’t doubt but they strive with their wealth and their lives in the Way of Allah. They are those who are truthful"
  49,16,"Say (O Muhammad): \"Will you inform Allah about your religion? Allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and Allah is All-Aware of everything"
  49,17,"They regard as favor upon you (O Muhammad) that they have embraced Islam. Say: \"Don’t count your Islam as a favor upon me. Nay, but Allah has conferred a favor upon you that Allah has guided you to the faith; (agree) if you indeed are truthful"
  49,18,"Surely, Allah knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth. Allah is the All-Seer of what you do"
