quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,60,"Have you not seen those (hypocrites) who claim that they believe in what has been sent down to you (O Muhammad), and what was sent down before you? They wish that they go for judgment (in their disputes) to fake judges though they were ordered that they reject it. But Satan wishes to mislead them far astray"
  4,61,"When it is said to them: “Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger (Muhammad),” you (Muhammad) see the hypocrites turn away from you with dislike"
  4,62,"How then (they behave) when a calamity befalls them for what their hands have sent forth? They come to you (Muhammad) swearing by Allah: “Surely, we want only goodwill and reconciliation.”"
  4,63,"They (hypocrites) are those of whom Allah knows what is in their hearts; so turn away from them, admonish them, and speak to them about themselves with penetrating (effective) words"
  4,64,"We never sent a Messenger, but who obeyed by Permission of Allah. If they (hypocrites), when they wronged themselves, they could have come to you (Muhammad) and asked forgiveness of Allah, and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Forgiving, Merciful"
  4,65,"But no (O Muhammad), by your Lord, they will not believe until they accept you as a judge in their disputes between them, and they don’t find in themselves any resistance on what you have decided, and accept with full submission"
