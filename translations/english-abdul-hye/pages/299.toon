quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  18,46,Wealth and children are the adornment of the worldly life. But the lasting righteous deeds are better with your Lord for rewards and better hope
  18,47,"And (remember) the Day when We shall cause the mountains to move, you will see the earth as a leveled plain (of waste), We shall gather them, and will not leave anyone of them behind"
  18,48,"And they will be set before your Lord in rows (and Allah will say): “Now indeed you have come to Us as We created you the first time. Nay, but you thought that We had never appointed a meeting for you.”"
  18,49,"And the book (one’s record) will be placed (before them), and you will see the sinners fearful of what is (recorded) in it. They will say: “Woe to us! What is the matter with this book? Neither it leaves out a small thing nor a big thing but has recorded it with numbers!” They will find all that they did and placed before them. Your Lord will not treat anyone with injustice"
  18,50,"And (remember) when We said to the angels: “Prostrate to Adam,” all prostrated except Satan. He was one of the jinns; he disobeyed the command of its Lord. Will you then take him (Satan) and its progeny as your protectors rather than Me while they are enemies to you? What an evil is the exchange for the wrongdoers"
  18,51,"(Allah) did not make them (Satan and its offspring) to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation, nor I (Allah) took the misleaders (of mankind) as helpers"
  18,52,"And (remember) the Day when He will say: “Call those partners of Mine whom you claimed.” They will cry to them but they will not answer them and We shall put a barrier between them"
  18,53,And the sinners will see the fire and realize that they have to fall therein. And they will not find a way of escape from it
