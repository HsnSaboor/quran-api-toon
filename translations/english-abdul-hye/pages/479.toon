quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  41,21,"They will say to their skins: “Why do you testify against us?” They will say: “Allah has caused us to speak as He causes all things to speak. He has created you the first time, and to Him you are made to return.”"
  41,22,"You used to hide (in the worldly life with your sins and never thought) your ears, your eyes, and your skins will testify against you. Rather you thought that even Allah does not know much of what you were doing"
  41,23,"That thought of yours which you thought about your Lord, has brought you to destruction, and you have become of those utterly lost"
  41,24,"Then, whether they have patience (or not), the fire will be a home for them, and if they beg to be excused, they are not those who will ever be excused"
  41,25,We have assigned intimate companions (of like nature in the world) for them who have made their past and present seem fair to them. The word (of punishment) is justified against them which has passed away (generations) of jinns and men before them. Indeed they are losers
  41,26,"Those who disbelieve say: “Don’t listen to this Qur’an and make noise in it (during recitation) so that you may gain the upper hand.”"
  41,27,"But surely, We shall cause the disbelievers to taste a severe punishment and We shall requite them the worst of what they used to do"
  41,28,"Such is the recompense of the enemies of Allah: the fire will be their eternal home, a recompense for their denying Our revelations"
  41,29,"Those who disbelieve will say: “Our Lord! Show us those from jinns and men who led us astray, we shall crush them under our feet so that they become the lowest.”"
