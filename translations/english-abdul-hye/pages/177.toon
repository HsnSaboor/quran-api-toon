quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,1,"They ask you (O Muhammad) about the spoils of war. Say: “The spoils are for Allah and the Messenger. So fear Allah and set right things (end differences) among you, and obey Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), if you are believers.”"
  8,2,"Only the believers are those who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts quake and when His Verses (this Qur’an) are recited to them, they increase in faith; and they put their trust in their Lord (alone)"
  8,3,who establish prayer and they spend out of what We have provided them
  8,4,"They are these who are the believers in truth. They have high ranks with their Lord; Forgiveness, and a generous sustenance"
  8,5,"As your Lord brought you (O Muhammad) out from your home (to struggle) for the truth, and surely, a party among the believers disliked it"
  8,6,"They disputed with you about the truth after it became clear, as if they were driven to the death while they were looking (at it)"
  8,7,"And (remember) when Allah promised you (Muslims) one of the 2 groups (of the enemy- army or caravan) that it should be for you, and you wished that one without having arms (the caravan) should be for you, but Allah willed to justify the truth by His Words and cut off the roots of the disbelievers (in the battle of Badr)"
  8,8,"so that He causes triumph the truth and proves false the falsehood, even though the evil-doers dislike it"
