  3,10,"Surely, those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their offspring will avail them anything from Allah and it is they who will be fuel of the fire"

  3,13,"Indeed there was a sign for you in 2 groups which met in combat (in the battle of Badr): One group was fighting in the cause of Allah and the other was disbelievers.

  3,14,"Beautified is for men with love of things they desire from women, children, store up heaps of gold and silver, branded (beautiful) horses and cattle, and land. These are the pleasure of the life of this world; but Allah has the excellent return (Paradise) with Him"
  3,15,"Say (O Muhammad): “Shall I inform you of far better things than those? For those who fear, there are gardens with their Lord in Paradise beneath which rivers flow. They will abide forever in it, with pure spouses. And Allah will be pleased with them. Allah is All-Seer of (His) servants.”"
