quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,though they will be made to see one another (no one can help including relatives). The criminal would wish to ransom himself from the punishment of that Day by his children
  70,12,his wife and his brother
  70,13,his kindred who gave him shelter
  70,14,"and all that is in the earth, so that it might save him"
  70,15,"But no means! Surely, it will be the fire of hell"
  70,16,to take away (burn completely) the head skin
  70,17,he will call all those who turn their backs and turn away their faces
  70,18,who collected (wealth) and hide it (from spending in the cause of Allah)
  70,19,"Surely, human has been created very impatient"
  70,20,"when the evil touches them, they are distressed"
  70,21,"but when good (fortune) touches them, they are stingy"
  70,22,except those who devote to prayers
  70,23,those who remain steadfast in their prayers
  70,24,those who set aside a known right in their wealth
  70,25,for the beggar who asks and for the deprived (who lost property and wealth)
  70,26,those who believe in the Day of recompense
  70,27,those who fear the punishment of their Lord
  70,28,surely! The punishment of their Lord is that before which none can feel secure
  70,29,those who guard their chastity (private parts from illegal sex)
  70,30,except with their wives or those whom their right hands possess so they are not to be blamed
  70,31,"But those who seek to go beyond this, then it is those who are transgressors"
  70,32,And those who keep their trusts and their covenants
  70,33,and those who stand firm in their testimonies
  70,34,and those who guard their prayers well
  70,35,it is they who will be in the gardens (Paradise) with honor
  70,36,So what is the matter with the disbelievers that they hasten to listen from you (O Muhammad)
  70,37,"sitting in groups on the right and on the left (of you, O Muhammad)"
  70,38,Does every one of them seek to enter the Paradise of delight
  70,39,"But nay! Surely, We have created them out of that which they (disbelievers) know"
