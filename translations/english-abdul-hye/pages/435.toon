  35,4,"And if they deny you (O Muhammad), so surely Messengers were denied before you. And to Allah all matters return (for decision)"
  35,5,"O mankind! Surely, the Promise of Allah is true. So don’t let the worldly life deceive you, and don’t let the chief deceiver (Satan) deceive you about Allah"
  35,6,"Surely, Satan is an enemy to you, so take him as an enemy. He only invites his followers so that they may become the inmates of the blazing fire"
  35,7,"Those who disbelieve, there will be a severe punishment for them; and those who believe and do righteous deeds, there will be forgiveness and a great reward for them"
  35,8,"Can those (be guided), to whom their evil deeds made fair seeming, so that they consider them good? Surely, Allah sends astray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills. So don’t destroy yourself (O Muhammad) for them in sorrow. Truly, Allah is the All-Knower of what they do"
  35,9,"And it is Allah Who sends the winds to rise up the clouds, then We drive them to a dead land, and therewith revives the earth after its death. Such will be the Resurrection (of the dead)"
  35,10,"Whoever desires the honor, (should know that) all honor belongs to Allah alone. Good Words ascend to Allah and the righteous deeds are exalted by Allah. But those who plot evils, they will have severe punishment and their plots will perish"
  35,11,"And Allah has created you from dust, then from a drop of semen, and then He made you pairs. No female conceives or gives birth without His Knowledge. No aged human is granted a long life or the life is cut short but is written in a book. Surely, that is easy for Allah"
