quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  71,11,He will send the sky (rain) to you in abundance
  71,12,"help you with increase in wealth and children, bestow on you gardens, and bestow on you rivers.’”"
  71,13,And what is the matter with that you don’t have any hope (from Allah)
  71,14,and surely He has created you in stages
  71,15,Don’t you see how Allah has created the 7 heavens one above another
  71,16,and has made the moon as a light in it and made the sun as a lamp
  71,17,And Allah has brought you out as a growth from the (dust of) earth
  71,18,"Then He will return you into it (the same earth), and bring you forth (to life again on the Day of Resurrection)"
  71,19,And Allah has made for you the earth as a wide spread
  71,20,so that you may go about in it on broad roads
  71,21,"Noah said: “My Lord! Surely they have disobeyed me, and followed those whose wealth and children give them no increase but only loss"
  71,22,They have plotted a mighty plot
  71,23,"and they have said: ‘Don’t leave your deity, nor shall you leave Wadd, nor Suwa, nor Yaghuth, nor Yauq, nor Nasr (names of the idols).’"
  71,24,"Indeed they have led many astray. (O Allah): don’t increase the wrongdoers (in anything) but error.”"
  71,25,Because of their sins they were drowned (in the flood) and were made to enter the fire. They did not find any help for them instead of Allah
  71,26,"And Noah said: “My Lord! Don’t leave any inhabitant of the disbelievers on the earth"
  71,27,"Surely if You leave them, they will mislead Your servants and they will beget none but wicked disbelievers"
  71,28,"My Lord! Forgive me, and my parents, and those who enter my home as a believer, and all the believing men and women. And You don’t grant increase to the wrongdoers but destruction!”"
