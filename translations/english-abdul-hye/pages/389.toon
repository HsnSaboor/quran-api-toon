quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,29,"When Moses fulfilled the term and was traveling with his family, he saw a fire in the direction of the mount Tur. He said to his family: “Wait, I have seen a fire; perhaps I may bring from there some information to you, or a burning brand of fire that you may warm yourselves.”"
  28,30,"So when he reached there (the fire), he was called from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place from the tree, (saying): “O Moses! Surely! I am Allah, the Lord of the worlds"
  28,31,"Throw your stick!” But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight and did not look back. (Allah said): “O Moses! Draw near and don’t fear. Surely, you are of those who are secure"
  28,32,"Put your hand in your bosom, it will come out (shinning) white without any harm, and draw your hand to you (whenever needed to be free) from fear. These are 2 evidences from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. Surely, they are rebellious people"
  28,33,"He said: “My Lord! Surely, I have killed a man from them and I fear that they will kill me"
  28,34,"My brother Aaron, he is more eloquent in speech than me, so send him with me as a helper to confirm me. Surely! I fear that they will deny me.”"
  28,35,"Allah said: “I will strengthen your arm with your brother and give power to both of you so that they shall not reach you. (Proceed) with Our signs. You 2 and those who follow you will be the victors.”"
