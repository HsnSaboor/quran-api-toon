quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,and grant me an honorable mention in later generations
  26,85,and make me one of the inheritors of the Paradise of Delight
  26,86,"and forgive my father, surely he is of the erring"
  26,87,and don’t disgrace me on the Day when all creatures will be resurrected
  26,88,the Day when neither wealth nor sons will avail
  26,89,except the one who will bring a clean heart to Allah
  26,90,and Paradise will be brought near to the pious
  26,91,and the hellfire will be placed in full view for the erring
  26,92,"and it will be said to them: “Where are those (false deities) that you used to worship"
  26,93,instead of Allah? Can they help you or help themselves?”
  26,94,"Then they will be thrown on their faces into it (fire), they are those who were in error"
  26,95,and the hosts (soldiers) of Satan together
  26,96,they will say while they argue in it
  26,97,"(saying): “by Allah, we were truly in a clear error"
  26,98,when We held you (false deities) as equals (in worship) with the Lord of the worlds
  26,99,And none has brought us into error except the criminals
  26,100,Now we have no intercessors
  26,101,nor a close friend (to help us)
  26,102,"If we had a chance (to return to the world), we would be among the believers!”"
  26,103,"Surely! In this narration there is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers"
  26,104,"And surely, your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,105,The people of Noah denied the Messengers
  26,106,"When their brother Noah said to them: “Will you not fear Allah"
  26,107,Surely I am a trustworthy Messenger to you
  26,108,"so fear Allah, and obey me"
  26,109,"I don’t ask you any reward for it (my message), my reward is not but from the Lord of the worlds"
  26,110,so fear Allah and obey me.”
  26,111,"They said: “Shall we believe in you, when the lowest (of the people) follow you?”"
