quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,95,"Surely! It is Allah who causes to split the grain and the fruit-stone. He brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the living. Such is Allah, then how are you being misled (from truth)"
  6,96,"(He) is the Cleaver (chopper) of the daybreak. He has made the night for resting, and the sun and the moon for reckoning. Such are the arrangements of the All-Mighty, the All-Knower"
  6,97,"It is He Who has made for you the stars, so that you may guide yourselves by them in darkness of the land and the sea. Indeed We have made clear the revelations for people who know"
  6,98,"It is He Who has created you from a single person (Adam), so there is a time-limit (on the earth) and a resting place (in the Hereafter). Indeed, We have made clear the Verses for people who understand"
  6,99,"It is He Who sends down rain from the heaven, We bring thereby vegetation of every kind, We bring forth thereby green stalks, We bring forth from it thick-clustered grain and from date-palm and from its sprout clusters of dates hanging low, and gardens of grapes, olives and pomegranates resembling (in kind), and yet different. Look at its fruit when it bears fruit, and its ripeness. Surely! In all these are signs for people who believe"
  6,100,"Yet, they make the jinns associates with Allah, though He has created them, and they falsely attribute to Him as sons and daughters without knowledge. He is glorified and exalted (far above) from what they attribute"
  6,101,He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How He can have a son when He did not have a mate? He has created every thing and He is the All-Knower of everything
