quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,41,"March forth whether you are light (healthy, young, and wealthy) or heavy (ill, old, and poor), strive hard with your wealth and your lives in the Way of Allah. This is better for you, if you understand"
  9,42,"(For the hypocrites) if the gain would have been immediate and an easy journey, they would have certainly followed you, but the long journey (Tabuk expedition) was too hard for them. (For not joining you in the expedition) they would swear by Allah: “If only we could, we would certainly have come forth with you.” They destroy their own selves, and Allah knows that they are liars"
  9,43,"May Allah forgive you (O Muhammad). Why did you grant permission to them (to stay behind), until those who told the truth become clear to you, and you had known the liars"
  9,44,Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day will not ask your permission (to be exempted) from fighting with their wealth and their lives. And Allah knows all of those who are pious
  9,45,It is only those who don’t believe in Allah and the Last Day and whose hearts are in doubt that ask your permission (exemption from fighting). So in their doubts they waver
  9,46,"And if they had intended to march out, certainly they would have made some preparation for it. But Allah did not like their going forth; so He made them lag behind, and it was said (to them): “You sit along with those who sit (at home).”"
  9,47,"Had they marched out with you, they would have added to you nothing except disorder, and they would have hurried about in your midst (spread corruption) and sowing sedition among you, and there are some among you who would have listened to them. Allah is All-Knower of those who are wrongdoers"
