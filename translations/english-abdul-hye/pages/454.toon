quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,17,"Be patient (O Muhammad) on what they say, and remember Our servant David, gifted with power. Surely, he was often turning in repentance (toward Allah)"
  38,18,"Surely, We made the mountains to glorify Our praises with him (David) in the evening and after sunrise"
  38,19,All the birds too assembled with him (David)
  38,20,We made his kingdom strong and gave him wisdom and sound judgment in speech (decision)
  38,21,Has the news of the 2 litigants (engaged in lawsuit) reached you when they climbed over the chamber (into his praying place)
  38,22,"When they entered in upon David, he was terrified of them. They said: “Don’t fear! We are 2 litigants; one of us has wronged on the other, therefore judge between us with truth, and not be unjust, and guide us to the Right Way"
  38,23,"Surely, this is my brother (in religion), he has 99 ewes (female sheep), while I have only one ewe. Yet he says: ‘Hand it over to me, and he overpowered me in speech.’”"
  38,24,"(David) said (without listening to the opponent): “He indeed has wronged you in demanding your ewe to his ewes. Surely, many partners oppress one on another, except those who believe and do righteous deeds, and they are few.” (While saying this) David realized that We have tested him, he sought forgiveness of his Lord, he fell down prostrate, and turned (to Allah) in repentance"
  38,25,"So We forgave him. Surely, for him is a near access to Us and a good place of return (Paradise)"
  38,26,"(Allah said): “O David! Surely! We have placed you as a vicegerent on the earth, so judge between people with justice and don’t follow your desire, for it will mislead you from the Way of Allah. Surely! Those who wander astray from the Way of Allah, they shall have a severe punishment, because they forgot the Day of Reckoning"
