  37,26,"Nay, but that Day they shall surrender"
  37,27,Some of them will face others to question one another
  37,28,"They will say (to their leaders): “Surely, you used to come to us from the right (with authority to beautify every evil, enjoin polytheism, and stop us from the truth).”"
  37,29,"They will reply: “Nay, you were not believers"
  37,30,We had no authority over you. Nay! You were transgressing people
  37,31,"now the Word of our Lord has become justified against us, and indeed we shall taste (the punishment)"
  37,32,So we led you astray because we were ourselves astray.”
  37,33,"Then surely on that Day, they will share in the punishment"
  37,34,"Certainly, that is how We shall deal with sinners"
  37,35,"surely, when it was said to them: “There is no one worthy of worship but Allah,” they used to puff themselves up with pride"
