quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,1,"Alif-Lam-Ra. These are the Verses of the book (the Qur’an), full of wisdom"
  10,2,"Is it strange for mankind that We have sent revelation to a man (Muhammad) from among themselves (saying) that: “Warn mankind and give good news to those who believe that they have footing (reward of good deeds) sure with their Lord?” But the disbelievers say: “This is indeed an evident sorcerer!”"
  10,3,"Surely, your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in 6 days and then rose over the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty), and is disposing the affair of all things. No intercessor (can plead with Allah) except after His permission. This is Allah, your Lord; so worship Him (alone). Then, will you not remember"
  10,4,To Him is the return of all of you. The Promise of Allah is true. It is He who begins the creation and then repeats (will bring back to life) it so that He may reward those who believed and did righteous deeds with justice. But those who disbelieved will have a drink of boiling fluids and painful punishment because they used to disbelieve
  10,5,It is He Who made the sun with a shining thing and the moon as a light and measured out for its stages so that you may compute the number of years and the reckoning. Allah did not create them but in truth. He has explained the Verses in detail for people who have knowledge
  10,6,"Surely, in the alternation of the night and the day and all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are signs for people who fear Him much"
