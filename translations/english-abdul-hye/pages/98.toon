quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,122,"But those who believe (in the oneness of Allah) and do good deeds, We shall admit them to the gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), they will abide in it forever. Promise of Allah is true, and whose word is truer than Allah"
  4,123,"(The final results will be) neither your desires nor desires of people of the Scripture. Whoever does evil, will be required to pay for it, and will not find besides Allah any protector or any helper"
  4,124,"And whoever does good deeds, whether male or female, and is a believer, these people will enter Paradise and they will not be wronged even a speck on the back of a date-stone"
  4,125,"And who can be better in religion than the one who submits face to Allah, is righteous, follows religion of Abraham the upright, and Allah did take Abraham as a friend"
  4,126,And to Allah belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. Allah is encompassing of everything
  4,127,"They ask you about women. Say: Allah instructs you about them, and what is recited to you in the book about orphan girls whom you don’t give them what was ordained for them (marriage-gift and inheritance) and yet you desire that you marry them. (Allah reminds you concerning) weak (and helpless) children among you that you stand for orphans with justice. Whatever good you do, indeed Allah is All-Aware of it"
