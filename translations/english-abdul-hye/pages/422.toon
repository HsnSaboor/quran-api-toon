quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  33,31,"Whoever of you (wives of the Prophet) is obedient to Allah and His Messenger, and does righteous deeds, We shall grant her double reward, and We have prepared a noble provision for her"
  33,32,"O wives of the prophet! You are not like any other women. If you fear Allah, then don’t be soft in speech (to men not related), lest the one in whose heart there is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire) may be moved with desire in his heart, but speak good words"
  33,33,"Stay in your homes and don’t display yourselves like that of the times of the first ignorance (pre-Islamic days); establish prayer, give obligatory charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger. O members of the family (of the prophet), Allah only wishes to remove evil deeds from you and to purify you perfectly"
  33,34,"And remember the Verses of Allah and the wisdom (Prophet’s sayings) which are recited in your houses, surely, Allah is Courteous, Well-Acquainted"
  33,35,"Surely, the Muslim men and the Muslim women, the believing men and the believing women, the obedient men and the obedient women, the truthful men and the truthful women, the patient men and the patient women, the humble men and the humble women, the charitable men and the charitable women, the fasting men and the fasting women, the men who guard their chastity and the women who guard it, the men who remember Allah much and the women who remember Allah - for all of them, Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward (Paradise)"
