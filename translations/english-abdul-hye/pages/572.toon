quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  72,1,"Say (O Muhammad): “It has been revealed to me that a group of jinns listened (to the Qur’an). They (returned to their folk and) said: ‘Surely! We have heard a wonderful recitation (this Qur’an)"
  72,2,it guides to the Right Way. We have believed in it and we shall never join (in worship) anything with our Lord
  72,3,"And surely, the majesty of our Lord is exalted: He has neither taken a wife nor a son"
  72,4,And the foolish among us have been uttering against Allah which was wrong and not right
  72,5,"surely, we thought that no human or jinns could utter a lie against Allah"
  72,6,"And surely, there were people among mankind used to seek refuge with individuals among the jinns, so they (jinns) increased them (mankind) in sin and arrogance"
  72,7,and they thought as you thought that Allah will never appoint anyone (as a Messenger to mankind or jinn)
  72,8,And we have sought to reach the heaven but found it filled with stern guards and flaming fires
  72,9,"We used to sit there at stations (heaven) to steal a hearing, but those who listen now find flaming fire (stars) watching in ambush for them"
  72,10,"We did not know whether an evil was intended for those on earth, or whether their Lord intends for them a Right Way"
  72,11,"There are some among us who are righteous, and some of us contrary to that; we are groups on different ways (religious sect)"
  72,12,And we know that we can neither escape (punishment of) Allah in the earth nor can we escape (punishment of) Him by flight
  72,13,"And indeed, when we heard the guidance (this Qur’an), we believed in it; and those who believe in their Lord shall have neither fear of any loss nor any oppression"
