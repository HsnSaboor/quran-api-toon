quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,Indeed successful are the believers
  23,2,those who are submissive in their prayers
  23,3,and those who turn away from evil vain talk
  23,4,and those who are doers of obligatory charity
  23,5,and those who guard their chastity
  23,6,"except from their wives or what their right hands (legally) possess, verily they are free from blame"
  23,7,"But whoever seeks beyond that, and then those are the transgressors"
  23,8,Those who are true to their trusts and to their covenants
  23,9,and those who strictly guard over their prayers
  23,10,These are the inheritors
  23,11,who will inherit the Paradise. They shall reside in it forever
  23,12,And indeed We created human out of extract of clay
  23,13,then We made him as a semen drop in a safe (womb of woman) lodging
  23,14,"then We created the drop into a clot, then We created the clot into a little lump of flesh, then We created the little lump of flesh into bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, and then We brought it forth as another creation. So blessed be Allah, the Best of creators"
  23,15,"Then after that, surely you will die"
  23,16,"then again, surely you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection"
  23,17,"And indeed We have created above you 7 heavens, and We are not unaware of the creation"
