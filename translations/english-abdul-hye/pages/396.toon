quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  28,85,"Surely, He Who has enjoined on you (O Muhammad) the Qur’an, will surely bring you to the best place of return. Say (O Muhammad): “My Lord is aware of the one who brings guidance and of the one who is in clear error.”"
  28,86,"And you (O Muhammad) never expected that the book (this Qur’an) would be sent down to you, but it is a Mercy from your Lord. So never be a supporter of the disbelievers"
  28,87,And let them not turn you (O Muhammad) away from the Verses of Allah after when they have been sent down to you. Invite (people) to your Lord and be not of the polytheists
  28,88,And don’t call Allah with any other one worthy of worship. There is no one worthy of worship but He. Everything will perish except Him. To Him belongs the decision and to Him you shall be returned
  29,1,Alif-Lam-Meem
  29,2,"Do the people think that they will be left alone on saying: “We believe,” and that they will not be tested"
  29,3,And indeed We tested those who were before them. And Allah will certainly make it known those who are telling the truth and will certainly make it known those who are liars
  29,4,Or do those who do evil deeds think that they can escape from Our reach? Evil is that which they judge
  29,5,"Whoever hopes for the meeting with Allah, and then surely Allah’s term is coming. Allah is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower"
  29,6,"And whoever strives, then strives only for oneself. Surely, Allah is Rich (not in any need) from all mankind and jinns"
