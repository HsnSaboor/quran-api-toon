quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,56,And We have not sent you (O Muhammad) but as a bearer of glad tidings and a Warner
  25,57,"Say: “I don’t ask you any reward for this (that I have brought the Qur’an from my Lord and its preaching, etc) except that whoever wills, may take a way to his Lord.”"
  25,58,"And put your trust (O Muhammad) in the Ever-Living (Allah) who does not die, glorify His Praises, and He alone is the All-Knower of the sins of His servants"
  25,59,"Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in 6 days. Then He rose over the Throne (that suits His Majesty). The Gracious! Ask Him (O Muhammad), as He is All-Knower of everything"
  25,60,"And when it is said to them: “Prostrate yourself to the Gracious (Allah),” they ask: “What is the Gracious? Shall we fall down in prostration because you (O Muhammad) command us?\" It increases dislike in them"
  25,61,"Blessed is He Who has placed big stars in the sky, has placed therein a great lamp (sun) and a moon giving light"
  25,62,"And it is He Who has put the night and the day in succession, for those who desire to remember or desire to show their gratitude"
  25,63,"And the servants of the Gracious (Allah) are those who walk on the earth in humility, and when the foolish address them, they say: “peace,”"
  25,64,"and those who spend the night before their Lord, prostrating and standing"
  25,65,"and those who say: “Our Lord! Avert from us the punishment of hell. Surely! Its punishment is an inseparable, permanent punishment"
  25,66,"indeed it (hell) is evil as an abode and as a place to reside,”"
  25,67,"and those who, when they spend, neither are extravagant nor stingy, but there is a medium (way) between those (extremes)"
