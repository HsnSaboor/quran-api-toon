quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,And Our Commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye
  54,51,"And indeed, (O disbelievers) We have destroyed many like you, and is there any who will remember (or take admonition)"
  54,52,Each and everything they have done is being noted in their deed records
  54,53,"Everything, small and big, is being written down"
  54,54,"Surely, the pious will be in the midst of gardens and rivers (Paradise)"
  54,55,"in a seat of truth (Paradise), near the most Powerful King (Allah)"
  55,1,The Gracious (Allah)
  55,2,Who taught (mankind) the Qur’an
  55,3,created human
  55,4,and taught human persuasive speech
  55,5,The sun and the moon (run on their fixed courses) for reckoning
  55,6,The stars and the trees both prostrate
  55,7,"And He has raised the heaven high, and He has set up the balance"
  55,8,so that you may not transgress in the balance
  55,9,Establish the weight with justice and don’t give less in measurement
  55,10,And He has put the earth for the creatures
  55,11,"therein are fruits, date-palms with sheathed fruit-stalks"
  55,12,and corn with leaves and stalk for food and sweet-scented plants
  55,13,Then which of your Lord’s favors will you both (jinns and human) deny
  55,14,He created man from sounding clay like the clay of pottery
  55,15,and He created the jinns from smokeless flame of fire
  55,16,Then which of your Lord’s favors will you both (jinns and human) deny
