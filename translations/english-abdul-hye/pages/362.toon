quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,21,"And those who don’t expect a meeting with Us (who deny the Day of Resurrection), say: “Why are not the angels sent down to us, or why do we not see our Lord?” Indeed they think arrogantly of themselves and are scornful with great pride"
  25,22,"On the Day they will see the angels; no glad tidings will be for the criminals that Day. Angels will say: “(All glad tidings) are strictly forbidden (for you).”"
  25,23,"And We shall turn to whatever deeds they (disbelievers) did, and We shall make them (deeds) as scattered floating particles of dust for them"
  25,24,The residents of Paradise on that Day will have the best abode and the finest place to relax
  25,25,"And (remember) the Day when the heaven shall be rent asunder with clouds, and the angels will be sent down with a grand descending"
  25,26,"The sovereignty on that Day will be the true (sovereignty), belongs to the Gracious (Allah), and it will be a hard Day for the disbelievers"
  25,27,"(Remember) the Day when the wrongdoer will bite on his hands saying: “Oh! Would that I had taken a way with the Messenger (Muhammad)"
  25,28,Oh! Woe to me! Would that I had never taken so-and-so as a friend
  25,29,Indeed they led me astray from the reminder (this Qur’an) after when it had come to me.” Satan is ever a deserter to human in the Hour of need
  25,30,"And the Messenger (Muhammad) will say: “O my Lord! Surely, my people took this Qur’an as deserted (neither learned nor acted upon it).”"
  25,31,Thus We have made for every Prophet an enemy among the criminals. But your Lord is sufficient as a Guide and Helper
  25,32,"And those who disbelieve say: “Why is not the Qur’an revealed to him all at once?” Thus (it was sent down in parts) so that We may strengthen your hearts thereby. And We have revealed it to you (gradually in stages). (It was revealed to Muhammad in 23 years)"
