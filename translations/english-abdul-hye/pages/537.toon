quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,"surely, this is indeed a honorable recital (the Qur’an)"
  56,78,in a book well-guarded (with Allah)
  56,79,which none can touch it (the Qur’an with Allah) except the purified (angels)
  56,80,a revelation (this Qur’an) from the Lord of the worlds
  56,81,Is it such a talk (this Qur’an) that you (disbelievers) deny
  56,82,"and (instead of thanking Allah for) your provision He gives you, you deny (Him)"
  56,83,Then why do you not (intervene) when (the soul of a dying person) reaches the throat
  56,84,while you are looking at that moment
  56,85,"but We are nearer to him than you, but you don’t see (Allah)"
  56,86,"Why do you not, if you are exempt from the reckoning and recompense"
  56,87,bring back the soul (to its body) if you are truthful
  56,88,"Then, if the dying person be of those brought near (to Allah)"
  56,89,"for him there is rest and provision, and a garden of delights (Paradise)"
  56,90,Yet if the dying person be of those on the right hand
  56,91,then (there is greeting) ‘Peace be upon you’ for those from those on the right hand
  56,92,"Yet if the dying person is one of the denying (of the Resurrection), the erring"
  56,93,then (for him there) is entertainment from boiling water
  56,94,and burning in hellfire
  56,95,"Surely, this is an absolute truth with certainty"
  56,96,"So glorify with praises the name of your Lord, the greatest"
  57,1,"All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah, and He is the All-Mighty, All-Wise"
  57,2,To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death and He has power over all things
  57,3,"He is the First (nothing is before Him) and the Last (nothing is after Him), the Evident (everything is in front of Him) and the Hidden (nothing is hidden from Him). And He is the All-Knower of every thing"
