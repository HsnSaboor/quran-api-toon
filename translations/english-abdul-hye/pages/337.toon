quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,39,"Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers) against whom fighting is waged because they (believers) are oppressed, and surely, Allah is Able to give them (believers) victory"
  22,40,"those who have been expelled from their homes without just cause only because they said: “Our Lord is Allah.” Had it not been that Allah checked one set of people by another; monasteries, churches, synagogues, and Masjids in which the Name of Allah is mentioned, much would surely have been pulled down. Surely, Allah will help those who help His (Cause). Truly, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty"
  22,41,"Those who, if We give them power in the land, will establish prayer, pay the obligatory charity, enjoin good, and forbid evil. And with Allah rests the final decision of all matters"
  22,42,"If they deny you (O Muhammad), surely did deny before them, by the people of Noah, Ad, and Thamud"
  22,43,and the people of Abraham and the people of Lot
  22,44,"and the residents of Midian; and Moses were denied. But I granted respite to the disbelievers, then I seized them, and how terrible was My punishment"
  22,45,"And many townships We have destroyed while they were wrong-doing. (Even today) they lie with their roofs in ruins, many deserted wells, and lofty (deserted) castles"
  22,46,"Have they not traveled through the land, and have they no hearts with them to understand or ears to hear (the truth)? Surely, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind"
