quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,32,"Because of that We ordained for children of Israel that whoever kills a person, except (as a punishment) for killing a person or for mischief in the earth, (it will be written) as if killed all mankind. Whoever saves a life, as if saves life of all mankind. Surely, Our Messengers came to them with clear signs, yet indeed many of them after that are those who committed excesses in the earth"
  5,33,"The only recompense of those who wage war against Allah, His Messenger, and spread mischief in the earth is that they are killed or they are crucified or their hands and their feet are cut off from opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is disgrace for them in this world, and a great punishment in the Hereafter"
  5,34,"except those who repent before you have power over them; so you should know that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  5,35,"O you who believe! You fear Allah, you seek (the means of) approach to Him, and you strive hard in His Way so that you may succeed"
  5,36,"Surely, those who disbelieve, if they have all that is in the earth, and as much as like therewith to ransom themselves from punishment on the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them, and for them is a painful punishment"
