quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,The people of Lot denied the Messengers
  26,161,"When their brother Lot said to them: “Will you not fear Allah"
  26,162,Surely! I am a trustworthy Messenger to you
  26,163,"So fear Allah, and obey me"
  26,164,"I don’t ask of you any reward for it (my message), my reward is from the Lord of the worlds"
  26,165,And will you go into the males (to fornicate) of the mankind
  26,166,"and leave those whom Allah has created for you to be your wives? Nay, you are a transgressing people!”"
  26,167,"They said: “If you don’t cease, O Lot! Surely, you will be one of those who are expelled!”"
  26,168,"He said: “I am, indeed of those who disapprove with severe anger and fury"
  26,169,My Lord! Save me and my family from what they do.”
  26,170,So We saved him and all his family
  26,171,except an old woman (his wife) among those who remained behind
  26,172,Then afterward We destroyed the others
  26,173,And We rained on them a rain (of punishment). Evil was the rain which fell on those who had been warned
  26,174,"Surely, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers"
  26,175,"And surely! Your Lord, He is indeed the All-Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,176,The residents of Al-Aiyka (a garden with thick trees near Midian) denied the Messengers
  26,177,"When Shuaib said to them: “Will you not fear Allah"
  26,178,I am a trustworthy Messenger to you
  26,179,"So fear Allah, and obey me"
  26,180,"I don’t ask of you any reward for it (my message), my reward is from the Lord of the worlds"
  26,181,"Give full measure, and don’t be among those who cause loss (to others by fraud)"
  26,182,And weigh with the just straight balance
  26,183,"and neither defraud people by reducing their things, nor do evil in the land making corruption"
