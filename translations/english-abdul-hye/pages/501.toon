quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  45,23,"Have you seen the one who has taken its own desires as worthy of worship? And Allah lets it astray upon knowing, and sealed over its hearing and its heart, and put a cover on its sight. Who then will guide him after Allah (has withdrawn)? Will you not then remember"
  45,24,"And they (disbelievers) say: “There is nothing but our life of this world. We die and we live, nothing but time destroys us.” They have no knowledge of it, verily they are only guessing"
  45,25,"And when Our clear revelations are recited to them, their argument is not except that they say: “Bring back our dead forefathers if you are truthful!”"
  45,26,"(O Muhammad) say (to them): “Allah gives you life and then causes you to die; then He will assemble you to the Day of Resurrection. There is no doubt about it. But most people don’t know.”"
  45,27,"And to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. On the Day when the Hour (of judgment) will be established, the followers of falsehood shall lose on that Day"
  45,28,"And you will see every nation humbled to its knees. Each nation will be called to its Record (of deeds). (It will be said): “This Day you shall be recompensed for what you used to do"
  45,29,"This Our record speaks about you with truth. Surely, We were recording (by angels) what you used to do.”"
  45,30,"Then, as for those who believed and did righteous deeds, their Lord will admit them into His Mercy. That will be the clear success"
  45,31,"But as for those who disbelieved (it will be said to them): “Were not Our Revelations recited to you? But you were proud and became a nation of criminals.”"
  45,32,"And when it was said: “Surely! Allah’s Promise is true and there is no doubt about the Hour (of judgment).” You used to say: ‘We don’t know what is the Hour (of Judgment); we think it only as a guess, and we have no firm convincing belief.’”"
