quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,and that which is in the hearts (of people) will be made known
  100,11,"surely, on that Day (of Resurrection) their Lord will be well-acquainted with them"
  101,1,"The striking Hour (Qari’ah, the Day of Calamity)"
  101,2,What is the striking Hour
  101,3,What will make you know what the striking Hour is
  101,4,It is the Day when mankind will be like scattered moths
  101,5,and the mountains will be like carded wool
  101,6,then as for the one whose balance (of good deeds) will be heavy
  101,7,he will reside in a pleasant life (Paradise)
  101,8,But as for the one whose balance (of good deeds) will be light
  101,9,he will abode in hell (Hawiyah)
  101,10,and what will make you know what it (Hawiyah) is
  101,11,(It is) a blazing fire
  102,1,(O mankind) you are distracted by the mutual rivalry (of piling up of worldly gains)
  102,2,(never be satisfied) until you come to the graves (die)
  102,3,Nay! You will soon come to know
  102,4,"Again, Nay! You will soon come to know"
  102,5,Nay! If you knew with real knowledge (from Qur’an)
  102,6,"Surely, You will see the blazing fire (of hell)"
  102,7,and you will see it with certainty of sight
  102,8,"then, on that Day, you shall be questioned about the blessings (given in the world and how you used)"
