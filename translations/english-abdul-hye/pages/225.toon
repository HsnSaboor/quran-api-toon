quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,"And O my people! I ask you no wealth for it, my reward is from none but Allah. I am not going to drive away those who have believed. Surely, they are going to meet their Lord, but I see you a people that are ignorant"
  11,30,"And O my people! Who will help me against Allah, if I drove them away? Will you not then give a thought"
  11,31,"And I don’t say to you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor that I know the unseen; nor do I say surely I am an angel, nor I say of those whom your eyes look down upon that Allah will never bestow any good on them. Allah knows best what is in their inner-selves (belief). Surely I will be in that case (if I say anything like this) indeed one of the wrongdoers.”"
  11,32,"They said: “O Noah! Surely you have disputed us and you have prolonged much the dispute with us, now bring upon us what you have threatened us with if you are of the truthful.”"
  11,33,"He said: “Only Allah will bring it (punishment) on you if He wills, and then you will not escape it"
  11,34,"My advice will not profit you even if I wish to give you good counsel, if Allah’s Will is to keep you astray. He is your Lord and to Him you shall return.”"
  11,35,"Or they (disbelievers of Makkah) say: “He (Muhammad) has fabricated it (the Qur’an).” Say: “If I have fabricated it, upon me be my crimes, but I am innocent of what crime you commit.”"
  11,36,"And it was revealed to Noah: “None of your people will believe except those who have already believed. So don’t be sad because of what they do"
  11,37,"Construct the ship under Our Eyes and with Our Revelation, and don’t plead with Me on behalf of those who do wrong; they are surely to be drowned.”"
