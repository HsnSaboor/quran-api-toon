quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,170,"When it is said to them: \"Follow what Allah has sent down.\" They say: \"Nay! We will follow what we found our fathers on it (practiced).\" (Would they follow) even if their fathers did not understand anything nor were they guided"
  2,171,"And the example of those who disbelieve is like the one who shouts to a group of sheep that does not hear except shouts and cries. (They are) deaf, dumb, and blind. So they don’t understand"
  2,172,"O you who believe! Eat of the lawful things that We have provided you with, and be grateful to Allah, if you worship Him only"
  2,173,"Surely! Allah has forbidden on you the dead (flesh), blood, flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered in any other name than Allah. But if one is forced by necessity without willful disobedience or transgression, then there is no sin on him. Surely, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"

  2,175,"Those are they who have purchased error at the price of guidance, and punishment at the price of forgiveness. So how bold are they to face the hellfire"
  2,176,"That is because Allah has sent down the book (the Qur’an) with the truth. And surely, those who differed in the book (the Qur’an) are far away in opposition"
