quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,119,"What happened to you that you don’t eat of that (meat) on which the name of Allah has been pronounced (during slaughter) when indeed He has explained to you what is forbidden to you, unless that you are constrained to it? Surely many lead people astray by their desires for lack of knowledge. Certainly your Lord knows best the transgressors"
  6,120,"Abandon (all kinds of) sin, open and secret. Surely, those who earn sin, they will be recompensed for what they have committed"
  6,121,"You don’t eat of that (meat) on which the name of Allah has not been pronounced (during slaughter), it is indeed a transgression. Indeed, the devils do inspire their friends (from mankind) so that they dispute with you, and if you obey them, then you would surely be polytheists"
  6,122,"Can he who was dead (by ignorance and disbelief), whom We gave life (by knowledge and belief), and whom We gave a light (belief) of likeness by it (can walk) among people, be like the one who is in the darkness (disbelief) from which can never come out? Thus it is made seem fair to the disbelievers what they used to do"
  6,123,and thus We have set up in every town leaders of its wicked ones to plot in it. But they don’t plot except against themselves though they don’t perceive
  6,124,"When a sign (Verse of the Qur’an) comes to them, they say: “We shall not believe until we are given like what was given to the Messengers of Allah.” Allah knows best where to place His message. Humiliation from Allah and a severe punishment will soon overtake the criminals for what they used to plot"
