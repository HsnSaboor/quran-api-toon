quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  7,179,"Surely, We have created many jinns and mankind for hell. They have hearts, they don’t understand with them; they have eyes, they don’t see with them; and they have ears, they don’t hear with them. They are like cattle, or even worse than them, they are those who are heedless"
  7,180,"And Allah has the excellent names (over 99 attributes), so call Him by them, and leave (company) of those who distort (in) His names. They will be requited for what they used to do"
  7,181,"And of those whom We have created, there is a party who guides others with the truth and establishes justice with it"
  7,182,"Those who reject Our Verses, We gradually seize them (with punishment) from where they don’t know"

  7,184,Do they not reflect (think)? There is not any madness in their companion (Muhammad). He is not but a plain Warner
  7,185,"Have they not looked in the dominion of the heavens and the earth and every thing what Allah has created, and that may be their term of life is drawn near? Then in what message after this will they believe"
  7,186,"Whoever Allah lets go astray, then there is none to guide; and He leaves in their transgressions, they wander blindly"
  7,187,"They ask you (O Muhammad) about the Hour (Day of Resurrection): “When will be its appointed time?” Say: “Its knowledge is only with my Lord (alone). None can disclose its time but He. It will weigh heavy in the heavens and the earth. It shall not come to you but suddenly.” They ask you as if you are very knowledgeable about it. Say: “Only its knowledge is with Allah (alone) but most people don’t know.”"
