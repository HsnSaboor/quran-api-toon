quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,102,"Such is Allah, your Lord! There is no one worthy of worship but He, the Creator of every thing. So worship Him (alone) and He is the Guardian over every thing"
  6,103,"No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all visions. He is the Subtle, Well-Aware of everything"
  6,104,"Surely, proofs have come to you from your Lord. So those who see will do so for their own self, and those who are blind, will do so against themselves. I (Muhammad) am not over you a keeper"
  6,105,"Thus We explain the Verses in various ways, and they (the disbelievers) may say: “You have learned (from the Scriptures of the people and brought this Qur’an)” and that We may make it clear for the people who have knowledge"
  6,106,"Follow what is revealed to you (O Muhammad) from your Lord, there is no one worthy of worship but He and turn away from the polytheists"
  6,107,"If Allah willed, they would not have associated others with Him. He has not made you a watcher over them nor you are a guardian over them"
  6,108,"And don’t insult those who (disbelievers) invoke other than Allah, lest they insult Allah wrongfully without knowledge. Thus We have made their deeds seem fair to each nation. Then to their Lord is their return and then He shall inform them of what they used to do"
  6,109,"They swear by Allah their strongest oaths, that if a Verse came to them, they would surely believe in it. Say: “Only the Verses are with Allah.” What will make you realize that when those Verses come, they will still not believe"
  6,110,"And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes (away from guidance), as they did not believe in it for the first time, and We shall leave them in their tyranny to wander blindly"
