quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,31,"Be upright to Him and don’t associate partners to Him. Those who assign partners to Allah, it is as if they had fallen from the sky, and the birds had snatched them, or the wind had thrown them to a far off place"
  22,32,"and whoever honors the Symbols of Allah, then it is truly from the piety of the heart"
  22,33,"You have in them (cattle for sacrifice) that benefit (such as milk) you for an appointed term, then (afterwards) they are brought for sacrifice to the ancient house (the Ka’bah)"
  22,34,"And for every nation We have appointed religious ceremonies so that they may mention the Name of Allah over the beast of cattle which He has given them (for food). Your one worthy of worship is One (Allah), to Him you submit, and (O Prophet) give glad tidings to those who obey Allah with humility"
  22,35,"those when Allah is mentioned, their hearts are filled with fear; those who are patient on whatever may befall on them (of calamities); who establish prayer, and they spend (in Allah’s Cause) out of what We have provided them"
  22,36,"And the cows, oxen, or camels (offered as sacrifices by the pilgrims), We have made them for you as among the Symbols of Allah; you have much good in them. So mention the Name of Allah over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice). Then when they are down on their sides (after slaughter), eat from them, and feed the poor people (who does not ask), and the beggar (who asks). Thus We have made these animals to you so that you may be grateful"
  22,37,"Neither their meat nor their blood reaches Allah, but the piety from you reaches Him. Thus We have made these animals to you so that you may magnify Allah for what He has guided you. (O Muhammad) give glad tidings to the doers of good"
  22,38,"Truly, Allah defends those who believe. Surely! Allah does not like any treacherous, ungrateful"
