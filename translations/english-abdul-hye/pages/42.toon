quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,253,"Those Messengers! We preferred some of them over others. To some of them, Allah spoke (directly), and He raised some of them in degrees (of honor). We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear signs and supported him with Holy Spirit (angel Gabriel). If Allah willed, the people who received the clear Verses (of Allah) would not have fought against each other. But they differed, some of them believed, and some of them disbelieved. If Allah willed, they would not have fought one another, but Allah does what He wills"
  2,254,"O you who believe! Spend of that which We have provided for you before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining, no friendship, and no intercession. It is the disbelievers who are the wrongdoers"
  2,255,"Allah! There is no one worthy of worship except He, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer and Protector. Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who can intercede with Him except with His permission? He knows what happens to them (creations) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter. And they cannot gain access to anything out of His knowledge except what He wills. His Chair (Throne) extends over the heavens and the earth, and He does not feel fatigue in guarding them. He is the Exalted, the Great"
  2,256,"There is no compulsion in religion. Surely, the Right Way has become distinct from the wrong (way). Whoever disbelieves in false deities and believes in Allah, indeed has grasped the firm handle that will never break. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower"
