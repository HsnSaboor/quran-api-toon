quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"Those who eat interest (usury), they will not stand (before Allah) except like those who are confused (insane) by the touch of Satan. That is because they say: \"Indeed trade is like usury,” while Allah has made the trade lawful and the usury unlawful. So those who receive admonition from their Lord and they refrain, stop eating usury, shall not be punished for the past. Their case is left to Allah (to judge). But those who repeats (to usury), they are inmates of the fire; they will abide in it forever"
  2,276,The usury deprives the blessings of Allah and increases by the charity. Allah does not like all ungrateful sinners
  2,277,"Indeed those who believe, do righteous deeds, establish prayer, and give obligatory charity; for them their rewards are with their Lord. There is no fear on them, nor shall they grieve"
  2,278,O you who believe! Fear Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from usury if you are believers
  2,279,"But if you don’t do it, then be warned of war from Allah and His Messenger. If you repent, you may retain your capital sums. You don’t wrong (by asking more than your capital), you will not be wronged (by receiving less than your capital)"
  2,280,"And if the debtor is in difficulty to pay (has no money), then delay until it is easy to repay. But if you remit it by way of charity that is better for you if you know"
  2,281,And fear the Day when you shall be brought back to Allah. Then everyone will be paid what he earned and none shall be dealt unjustly
