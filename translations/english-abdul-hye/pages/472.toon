quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,41,And O my people! How is it that I call you to salvation and you call me to the fire
  40,42,"You invite me to disbelieve in Allah and to join (partners) with Allah about which I have no knowledge; while I invite you to the All-Mighty, the Forgiving"
  40,43,No doubt that you call me to worship it which can neither grant a claim (request) in this world nor in the Hereafter. Our return will be to Allah; and the polytheists will be the inmates of the fire
  40,44,"And you will remember what I am telling you and I leave all my matters to Allah. Surely, Allah is the All-Seer of everything of the servants.”"
  40,45,"So Allah saved him (believer) from the evils what they plotted (against him), and encompassed Pharaoh’s people with an evil punishment"
  40,46,"They are exposed to the fire morning and afternoon, and on the Day when the Hour will be established (angels will be told): “Cause Pharaoh’s people to enter the severest punishment!”"
  40,47,"And when they will dispute in the fire, the weak will say to those who were arrogant: “Surely! We were your followers, so can you save us from a portion of the fire?”"
  40,48,"Those who were arrogant will say: “Surely we are all together in it (fire)! Verily, Allah has judged between His servants!”"
  40,49,"And those in the fire will say to the keepers (angels) of hell: “Call upon your Lord to lighten the punishment for us for a day!”"
