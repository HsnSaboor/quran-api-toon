quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,And how many generations We have destroyed before them who were stronger in power than them? (When punishment came) they ran for a refuge in the land! Could they find any place of refuge (to save them from destruction)
  50,37,"Surely, in that, there is a lesson for one who has a heart or gives ear while one is witness"
  50,38,"And indeed We created the heavens and the earth and all between them in 6 days, and no fatigue touched Allah"
  50,39,"So, bear with patience (O Muhammad) on all that they say, and glorify the praises of your Lord before sunrise and before sunset"
  50,40,"And during a part of the night, glorify His praises and after the prostration (prayers)"
  50,41,And listen on the Day when the caller will call from a near place
  50,42,"the Day when the people will hear the cry in truth; that will be the Day of coming out (dead will rise from the graves i.e., the Day of Resurrection)"
  50,43,"Surely, it is We Who gives life and causes death; and to Us is the final return"
  50,44,on the Day when the earth shall be split asunder and the people will be rushing out of it; that will be a gathering quite easy for Us
  50,45,"We know very well what they (disbelievers) say. You (O Muhammad) are not a tyrant over them (to force them to believe). So warn by the Qur’an, (everyone) who fears My warning"
  51,1,By (the winds) that scatter dust
  51,2,and (the clouds) that bear heavy weight of water
  51,3,and (the ships) that float with ease and gentleness
  51,4,and those (angels) that distribute command (of Allah)
  51,5,surely that which you are Promised is true
  51,6,"and surely, the recompense is sure to happen"
