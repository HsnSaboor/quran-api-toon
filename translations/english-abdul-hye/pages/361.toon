quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  25,12,"When it (hell) shall come in their sight from a far place, they will hear it’s raging and roaring"
  25,13,"When chained together, they will be thrown into a narrow place thereof; they will exclaim in it for destruction (death)"
  25,14,"(They will be told): “You don’t call today for one destruction, but call for many destructions.”"
  25,15,"Say (them O Muhammad): “Is this (punishment in hell) better or the Paradise of Eternity which has been promised to the pious people? It will be for them as a reward and as a final destination"
  25,16,for them there will be all that they desire in it and they will abide there forever. It is a Promise upon your Lord that must be fulfilled.”
  25,17,"And on the Day He will gather them and those whom they worshipped besides Allah. He will ask: “Was it you who misled My servants or did they astray (themselves from) the Right Way?”"
  25,18,"They (believing partners) will say: “Glory be to You! It was not proper for us to take any protectors besides You, but You gave them and their forefathers comfort (of the world) until they forgot the warning, and became a lost people.”"
  25,19,"Thus surely, they (believing partners) will deny you (polytheists) regarding what you say today. Then you shall neither avert (the punishment), nor get help. Those among you did wrong; We shall make them taste the great punishment"
  25,20,"And We have never sent before you (O Muhammad) any of the Messengers but surely, they ate food and walked in the markets. And We have made some of you as a trial for others. Now, will you have patience? Your Lord is All-Seer of everything"
