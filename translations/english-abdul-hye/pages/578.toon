quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,nay but you (mankind) love the present life of this world
  75,21,and leave the Hereafter
  75,22,"On that Day, some faces will be radiant"
  75,23,looking towards their Lord
  75,24,"On that Day, other faces will be gloomy"
  75,25,thinking that some calamity is about to fall on them
  75,26,"Nay, when it (soul) reaches to the collar bone (up to the throat in its exit)"
  75,27,"and it will be said: “Who can cure (save from death)?”"
  75,28,He (dying person) will conclude that it was the time of departure (death)
  75,29,and one leg will be joined with another leg (shrouded)
  75,30,"on that Day, the drive will be to your Lord"
  75,31,So the he (disbeliever) neither believed nor prayed
  75,32,but (on the contrary) he denied (this Qur’an) and turned away
  75,33,Then he walked to his family admiring himself
  75,34,Woe to you (disbeliever)! And then (again) woe to you
  75,35,(Again) woe to you (disbeliever)! And then (again) woe to you
  75,36,Does the human think that it will be left (to wander) without requital (any purpose)
  75,37,Was the human not a drop of emitted semen
  75,38,Then he became a hanging clot; then (Allah) created and fashioned him in due proportion
  75,39,"and made him either of the 2 sexes, male and female"
  75,40,Is not He Able to give life to the dead
  76,1,"Has there not come over human, a period of time when it was not a thing worth mentioning"
  76,2,"Surely, We have created human from the sperm drop of mixed semen (containing both sexual discharge) in order to test human. So We gave people to hear and see"
  76,3,"Surely, We showed human the Way, whether it be grateful or ungrateful"
  76,4,"Surely, We have prepared for the disbelievers iron chains, iron collars, and a blazing fire"
  76,5,"Surely, the righteous shall drink from a cup (of wine) mixed with water from a spring in Paradise called Kafur"
