quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  20,126,"(Allah) will say: “Just as Our Verses came to you but you disregarded them, so you are neglected today.”"
  20,127,And thus We requite the one who transgresses and don’t believe in the Verses of its Lord. Surely the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more lasting
  20,128,"It it not a guidance for them (to know) how many generations We have destroyed before them and in whose residences they walk? Surely, in these (ruins) there are signs for people of understanding"
  20,129,"And had it not been for a word that went forth from your Lord and a term determined, it (judgment) would have been inevitable"
  20,130,"So you (O Muhammad) bear patiently on what they say. Glorify the praises of your Lord before sunrise, before sunset, during Hours of the night, and glorify at the ends of the day, so that you may become pleased (satisfied)"
  20,131,"And don’t strain your eyes (with envy) for what We have given for enjoyment to various groups of them (disbelievers), and with the luxury of the worldly life We may test them in it. The (lawful) provision of your Lord is better and more lasting"
  20,132,"And enjoin the prayer on your family, and be patient in it. We don’t ask you a provision; We provide for you. And the good end (Paradise) is for the pious"
  20,133,"They say: “Why does he (Muhammad) not bring us a sign from his Lord?” Has not proof (the Qur’an) came to them which is (contains teachings) of the previous Scriptures"
  20,134,"And if We had destroyed them with a punishment before this (the Qur’an), surely they would have said: “Our Lord! If You only had sent us a Messenger, we would certainly have followed Your Verses before we were disgraced and humiliated.”"
  20,135,"Say (O Muhammad): “Each one (believer and disbeliever) is waiting, so you wait too. Then you shall know who is following the Right Way and who have been rightly guided.”"
