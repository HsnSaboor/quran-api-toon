quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  29,24,"There was no answer of his (Abraham’s) people except that they said: “Kill him or burn him.” But Allah saved him from the fire. Surely, in this, there are signs for people who believe"
  29,25,"And (Abraham) said: “You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the worldly life; but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, curse each other, your abode will be the fire, and you shall have no helper.”"
  29,26,"So Lot believed in him (Abraham). (Abraham) said: “Surely, I will emigrate for the sake of my Lord. He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”"
  29,27,"We bestowed on him (Abraham), Isaac (son) and Jacob (grandson), and ordained Prophethood and the book in his offspring. We granted him his reward in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous"
  29,28,"And (remember) Lot, when he said to his people: “Surely you are committing the worst sin; no one has preceded you in committing it in the worlds"
  29,29,"Surely, do you commit (sodomy) with men, rob travelers in the road, and practice every kind of evil deed in your gatherings?” But his people gave no answer except that they said: “Bring punishment of Allah upon us if you are one of the truthful.”"
  29,30,"He (Lot) said: “My Lord! Help me against the corrupt people.”"
