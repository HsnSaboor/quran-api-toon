quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  36,13,"And put forward to them an example; the story of the residents of the town (Antakiya, Turkey) to whom the Messengers came"
  36,14,"When We sent to them 2 Messengers, they denied them both, so We reinforced them with a 3rd, and they said: “Surely! We have been sent to you as Messengers.”"
  36,15,"They (people of the town) said: “You are but humans like us. The Gracious (Allah) has revealed nothing, you are telling lies.”"
  36,16,"They (Messengers) said: “Our Lord knows that we have been sent as Messengers to you"
  36,17,and our duty is to convey the message clearly.”
  36,18,"They (people) said: “Surely, we see an evil omen (sign) from you. If you don’t stop, we will surely stone you and a painful punishment will touch you from us.”"
  36,19,"They (Messengers) said: “Your evil omens be with you! (Do you call it ‘evil omen’) because you are admonished? Nay, but you are a transgressing people.”"
  36,20,"And there came a man running from the farthest part of the town and said: “O my people! Follow the Messengers"
  36,21,Follow those who don’t ask of you any wages and they are rightly guided
  36,22,Why should I not worship Him Who has created me and to Whom you shall be returned
  36,23,"Shall I take another worthy of worship besides Him? If the Gracious (Allah) intends me no harm, their intercession will avail me nothing, nor can they save me"
  36,24,"Then surely, I would be in plain error"
  36,25,"Surely! I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me!”"
  36,26,"It was said (to him when the disbelievers killed him): “Enter Paradise.” He said: “Would that my people knew (what I know)"
  36,27,That my Lord has forgiven me and made me among the honored ones!”
