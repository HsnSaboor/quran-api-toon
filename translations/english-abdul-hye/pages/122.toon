quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"When they (monks and priests) hear what has been sent down to the Messenger (Muhammad), you see their eyes overflow with tears because they have recognized the truth. They say: “Our Lord! We believe; so write us down with the witnesses"
  5,84,Why should we not believe in Allah and in that which has come to us of the truth? We wish that our Lord will admit us (in Paradise) with the righteous people.”
  5,85,"So Allah rewarded them for what they said with gardens under them the flowing rivers (in Paradise), they will abide forever in it. Such is the reward of righteous people"
  5,86,"But those who disbelieved and denied Our Verses, they shall be the inmates of the fire"
  5,87,"O you who believe! Don’t make good things unlawful what Allah has made lawful to you, and you don’t transgress. Surely, Allah does not like the transgressors"
  5,88,"And eat of what sustenance provided to you by Allah, lawful and good things. You fear Allah, in Whom you believe"
  5,89,"Allah will not call you to account for unintentional things in your oaths. But He will call you to account for earnestly sworn in oaths. The penalty (for a broken oath) is feeding 10 needy people of average of what you feed your families; or clothing them; or freeing a captive. But whoever can not afford, then fasting for 3 days. That is expiation of your oaths when you have sworn. But keep your oaths. Thus Allah makes clear to you His Verses so that you may give thanks"
