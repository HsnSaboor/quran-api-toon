quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,This Day he has neither a friend here
  69,36,nor any food except the filth from the washing of wounds
  69,37,which none will eat except the sinners.”
  69,38,"So, surely I swear by whatever you see"
  69,39,and by whatever you don’t see
  69,40,that surely this is the word of an honored Messenger
  69,41,"It is not the word of a poet, little is that you believe"
  69,42,"nor it is the word of a soothsayer, little is that you remember"
  69,43,This is the revelation sent down from the Lord of the worlds
  69,44,Had he (Muhammad) forged false sayings concerning Us
  69,45,We certainly would have seized him by his right hand
  69,46,then certainly would have cut off his life artery
  69,47,and none of you could prevent (Us) from punishing him
  69,48,Surely this (Qur’an) is a reminder for the pious
  69,49,Surely We know that there are some among you who deny (the Qur’an)
  69,50,and indeed it (this Qur’an) will be an anguish for the disbelievers
  69,51,"Yet, it (this Qur’an) is an absolute truth with certainty"
  69,52,"So glorify the name of your Lord, the Great"
  70,1,A questioner asked concerning a punishment about to befall
  70,2,"upon the disbelievers, none can avert"
  70,3,"(It will come) from Allah, the Lord of the Ways of Ascent"
  70,4,"The angels and the spirit (Gabriel) ascend to Him in a Day the measure of which is 50,000 years"
  70,5,So be patient (O Muhammad) with a good patience
  70,6,Surely! They see it (Day of judgment) to be far off
  70,7,but We see it quite near
  70,8,"On that Day, the sky will be like molten lead"
  70,9,and the mountains will be like flakes of wool
  70,10,and no friend will ask of a friend
