quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  15,1,Alif-Lam-Ra. These are the Verses of the book and a plain Qur’an
  15,2,Perhaps (the Day will come when) those who disbelieve wish that they were Muslims
  15,3,"Leave them (alone) to eat, let them enjoy, and be preoccupied (with false) hope. They will come to know (the truth)"
  15,4,And Allah did not destroy a town but there was a known decree for it
  15,5,"No nation can advance its term (fate), nor delay it"
  15,6,"And they say: “O you (Muhammad) to whom the reminder (the Qur’an) has been sent down! Surely, you are insane"
  15,7,Why don’t you bring angels to us if you are of the truthful ones?”
  15,8,"We don’t send down the angels except with the truth (for punishment), and when they come, they (the disbelievers) are not given respite"
  15,9,"Truly, We have sent down the reminder (the Qur’an), and surely, We will guard it"
  15,10,"Indeed, We sent (Messengers) before you (O Muhammad) amongst the early communities"
  15,11,"and any Messenger came to them, they mocked at him"
  15,12,Thus We let it (disbelief) enter into the hearts of the sinners
  15,13,"so they don’t believe in it (the Qur’an), though the examples of (Allah’s punishment of) the ancients have passed"
  15,14,And even if We had opened to them a gate from the heaven and they continue to ascend through it
  15,15,"surely they would have said: “Our eyes have been blocked (blurred). But nay, we have been bewitched.”"
