quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,(On that Day) no intercession of intercessors will be of any use to them

  74,50,As if they were frightened donkeys
  74,51,"fleeing from a hunter, or a lion, or a beast of prey"
  74,52,"Nay, everyone of them desires that he should be given pages spread out (writing from Allah that Islam is the right religion)"
  74,53,Nay! But they don’t fear the Hereafter (Allah’s punishment)
  74,54,"Nay, surely, this (Qur’an) is an admonition"
  74,55,"So whoever wills (let him read it), will reflect on it"
  74,56,And they will not take heed unless Allah wills. He is the One deserves that mankind should be afraid of Him. He is the One Who forgives
  75,1,I swear by the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,and I swear by the self-reproaching person (believer)
  75,3,Does mankind think that We shall not assemble their bones
  75,4,"Yes, We are Able to put together in perfect order very tips of their fingers"
  75,5,But mankind desires to continue committing sins
  75,6,"He (mankind) asks: “When will be this Day of Resurrection?”"

  75,9,and the sun and moon will be joined together

  75,12,"On that Day, the place of rest will only be to your Lord"
  75,13,On that Day mankind will be informed of (their deeds) what they sent forward and what they left behind
  75,14,Nay! Mankind will be witness against themselves (body parts will speak about deeds)
  75,15,though they may put forth their excuses (to cover evil deeds)
  75,16,(O Muhammad) don’t move your tongue with it (the Qur’an) to make haste therewith (to memorize the Verses)
  75,17,"surely, it is upon Us to collect it and give you (O Muhammad) the ability to recite it (the Qur’an)"
  75,18,"and when We have recited it to you (O Muhammad through Gabriel), then you follow its (the Qur’an’s) recitation"
  75,19,"then surely, it is for Us to make it clear to you"
