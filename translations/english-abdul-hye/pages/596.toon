quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,In which none will burn except the most wretched
  92,16,who denies (the truth) and turns away
  92,17,But the pious will be far removed from it (hell)
  92,18,the one who spends his wealth (in charity) that may grow (for self-purification)
  92,19,who has in mind no favor from anyone to be paid back
  92,20,"except to seek the pleasure of his Lord, the High"
  92,21,Such person will be pleased (with Allah when he will enter Paradise)
  93,1,By the morning day light
  93,2,and by the night when it covers (with darkens)
  93,3,(O Muhammad) your Lord has neither forsaken you nor displeased with you
  93,4,"Indeed, the Hereafter will be better for you than the first (worldly life)"
  93,5,"Surely, your Lord will give you (good) so that you will be well-pleased"
  93,6,Did He not find you (O Muhammad) an orphan and gave you a refuge
  93,7,And did He not find you (O Muhammad) lost and gave you guidance
  93,8,And did He not find you (O Muhammad) poor and made you rich (self-sufficient)
  93,9,"So, don’t treat the orphan with oppression"
  93,10,and don’t repulse the beggar
  93,11,and proclaim the Grace of your Lord
  94,1,Have We not opened your heart for you (O Muhammad)
  94,2,and removed your burden from you
  94,3,which weighed down your back
  94,4,and raised high for you your fame
  94,5,"Surely, with the hardship, there is relief"
  94,6,"Surely, with the hardship, there is relief"
  94,7,"When you have finished (your work), then stand up (for Allah’s worship)"
  94,8,and turn (your attention) to your Lord
