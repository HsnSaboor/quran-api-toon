quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  17,67,"And whenever any harm touches you at the sea, all those to whom you call upon except Him (Allah) vanish. Yet, when He brings you safely to the land, you turn away (from Him). And human is ever ungrateful"
  17,68,"Do you then feel secure that He will not cause side of the land to swallow you up, or send against you a violent sand-storm? Then, you shall not find a guardian for you"
  17,69,"Or do you feel secure that when you will return to it (sea) a 2nd time, He will not send a hurricane of wind against you and drown you because of your disbelief? (If that happens) then you will not find for you therein an avenger (to take revenge) against Us"
  17,70,"And indeed, We have honored the children of Adam, We have carried them on land and sea, have provided them with good things, and have preferred them over many of those whom We have created with a marked preference"
  17,71,(Remember) the Day when We shall call all human beings with their leaders. Those who will be given their book (of records) in their right hand will read their records and will not be dealt unjustly in the least
  17,72,But those who are blind (acted) in this world will be blind in the Hereafter and more astray from the way
  17,73,"Surely, they were about to tempt you (O Muhammad) away from that which We have revealed (the Qur’an) to you, to fabricate something other than it against Us, and (if successful) then they would have certainly taken you a friend"
  17,74,"And had We not made you stand firm, surely you would nearly have inclined to (compromise with) them a little bit"
  17,75,Then We would have made you taste a double punishment in this life and a double punishment after death. Then you would not have found anyone to help you against Us
