quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,59,"Surely, the Hour (Day of Judgment) is coming and there is no doubt about it, yet most people don’t believe"
  40,60,"And your Lord said: “Invoke Me, I will respond to you. Surely! Those who are arrogant about My worship, they will surely enter hell in humiliation!”"
  40,61,"It is Allah who has made the night for you so that you may rest in it and the day for you to see. Truly, Allah is Bountiful to mankind, yet most people don’t give thanks"
  40,62,"That is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things, there is no one worthy of worship but He, how then you are turned away (from Him)"
  40,63,Thus those who were turned away were denying in the Verses of Allah
  40,64,"It is Allah Who has made for you the earth as a residing place and the sky as a canopy, has given you shape and made your shapes good looking and has provided you with good things. That is Allah, your Lord, then blessed be Allah, the Lord of the worlds"
  40,65,"He is the Ever-living; there is no one worthy of worship but He, so invoke Him making your worship pure (alone) to Him. All the praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds"
  40,66,"Say (O Muhammad): “Surely I have been forbidden to worship those whom you worship besides Allah, since there have come to me evidences from my Lord, and I am commanded to submit (in Islam) to the Lord of the worlds"
