quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,"surely, he thought and plotted"
  74,19,"So let him be cursed, how he plotted"
  74,20,"And (again) let him be cursed, how he plotted"
  74,21,Then he thought
  74,22,then frowned and looked in a bad tempered way
  74,23,then he turned his back and was proud
  74,24,"and he said: “This is nothing but a magic from the old"
  74,25,this is nothing but the word of a human being.”
  74,26,I will burn him in hellfire
  74,27,And what will make you know exactly what hellfire is
  74,28,"It does not spare (any sinner), nor does it leave (anything not burnt)"
  74,29,Fire burns the skins
  74,30,Over it are 19 (angels as guardians and keepers of hell)
  74,31,"And We have set none but angels as guardians of the fire. We have not fixed their numbers (19) except as a trial for those who disbelieve in order that those who were given the Scripture may be convinced (Qur’an is the truth as it agrees with their books i.e. number (19) is written in the Torah and the Gospel). Those who believe may increase in faith (in Qur’an). Those who were given the Scripture and believers may say to those in whose hearts there is a disease (hypocrisy) and the disbelievers say: “What Allah means by this example?” Allah leads astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. No one knows the forces of your Lord but He. This (Qur’an) is nothing but a reminder to mankind"
  74,32,"Nay, by the moon"
  74,33,and by the night when it withdraws
  74,34,and by the dawn when it brightens
  74,35,"surely, it (hell) is one of the greatest signs"
  74,36,and a warning to mankind
  74,37,"to any of you that chooses to go forward (by righteous deeds), or remain behind (by sins)"
  74,38,Every person is held in a pledge for what he has earned
  74,39,except those on the right (true believers)
  74,40,in gardens (Paradise) they will ask one another
  74,41,about the criminals. (They will say to them)
  74,42,“What has caused you to enter into hell?”
  74,43,"They will say: “We were not of those who used to offer prayers"
  74,44,nor we used to feed the poor
  74,45,we used to talk falsehood with vain talkers
  74,46,and we used to deny the Day of recompense
  74,47,until there came to us the certainty (death).”
