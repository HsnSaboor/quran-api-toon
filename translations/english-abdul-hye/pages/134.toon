  6,54,"When those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say: “Peace be upon you.” Your Lord has made the Mercy incumbent upon Himself. If any one of you does evil in ignorance, then repents after that, and mends ways; then surely, He is Forgiving, Merciful"

  6,56,"Say (O Muhammad): “I am forbidden that I worship those whom you call upon besides Allah.” Say: “I will not follow your desires, then I will go astray, and I will not be of the guided.”"

  6,58,"Say: “If I had that power which you are asking for impatiently (the punishment), the matter would have been settled at once between me and you, but Allah knows the best the wrongdoers"
