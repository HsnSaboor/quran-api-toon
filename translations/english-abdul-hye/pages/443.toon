quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,And a sign for them is that We carried their offspring in the laden ship (of Noah)
  36,42,And We have created for them similar (vessels) on which they ride
  36,43,"And if We will, We can drown them, and there will be no helper for them, nor will they be saved"
  36,44,except through the Mercy from Us and as an enjoyment for a while
  36,45,"And when it is said to them: “Beware of that which is before you (worldly punishments) and that which is behind you (punishments in the Hereafter) so that you may receive Mercy.”"
  36,46,"And whenever a sign of the Verses of their Lord comes to them, they turn away from it"
  36,47,"Whenever it is said to them:“Spend out of what Allah has provided you.” Those who disbelieve say to those who believe: “Should we feed those whom, if Allah wills, He (Himself) can feed? You are in plain error.”"
  36,48,"And they say: “When will this Promise (Resurrection) be fulfilled if you are truthful?”"
  36,49,"They are waiting for a single shout, which will seize them while they are disputing (among themselves)"
  36,50,"Then, they will neither be able to make a will, nor they will be able to return to their family"
  36,51,And the trumpet will be blown in and behold! They will come out quickly from the graves to their Lord
  36,52,"They will say: “Woe to us! Who has raised us up from our place of sleep?” (It will be said to them): “This is what the Gracious (Allah) had promised and the Messengers spoke the truth!”"
  36,53,"It will only be a single shout, so behold! They all will be brought up before Us"
  36,54,"This Day (of Resurrection), no soul will be wronged in anything and you will be rewarded for your deeds"
