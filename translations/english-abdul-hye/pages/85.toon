quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,38,"And (also) those who spend their wealth to be seen by people, and don’t believe in Allah and the Last Day, and those who take Satan as a companion; then what a bad companion (they have)"
  4,39,"And what loss they would have if they had believed in Allah and the Last Day, and spend out what Allah has given them for sustenance? Allah is All-Knower of them"
  4,40,"Surely! Allah does not do wrong (not even) weight of an atom. If there is a good (done), He doubles it, and gives (extra) with a great reward from Him"
  4,41,How (will it be) then when We bring from each community a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad) a witness against these people
  4,42,"On that Day (of Judgment) those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger (Muhammad) will wish if they were leveled (buried) with the earth, for they will not (be able to) hide any matter from Allah"
  4,43,"O you who believe! Don’t offer the prayer while you are intoxicated until you know (the meaning) of what you utter, nor when you are defiled (or in a state of sexual impurity) except when passing on way (traveling) until you wash yourselves. If you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you came from a toilet, or you had a sexual contact with women but did not find water, then do Tayammum with clean earth and rub with it your faces and your hands. Truly, Allah is Pardoning, Forgiving"
  4,44,"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the book? They purchased error (wrong way), and they wish that you (believers) lose the Right Way"
