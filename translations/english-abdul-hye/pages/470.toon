quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,26,"Pharaoh said: “Let me kill Moses, and let him call his Lord (to stop me)! Surely, I fear that he may change your religion or that he may cause mischief to appear in the land!”"
  40,27,"Moses said: “Surely, I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant who don’t believe in the Day of reckoning!”"
  40,28,"And a believer from Pharaoh’s family, who hid his faith, said: “Will you kill a man because he says: ‘My Lord is Allah,’ especially when Moses has come to you with clear signs from your Lord? If he is a liar, his sin will lie upon him; but if he is telling the truth, then some of that (calamity) which he threatens you will befall on you. Surely, Allah does not guide the one who is a polytheist, a liar"
  40,29,"O my people! You are the ruler today and you are uppermost in the land. But who will save us from the punishment of Allah, if it comes to us?” Pharaoh said: “I show you what I see correct and I guide you to the way of right policy!”"
  40,30,"And he (who believed) said: “O my people! Surely, I fear for you a fate like that Day (disaster) of the confederates"
  40,31,"like the fate of the people of Noah, Ad, Thamud, and those who came after them. Allah wants no injustice for (His) servants"
  40,32,And O my people! Surely! I fear for you the Day when there will be mutual calling (between the people of hell and Paradise)
  40,33,"a Day when you will turn your backs and you have no protector from Allah. Whomever Allah sends astray, there is no guide for him"
