  7,164,"And when a group among them said: “Why do you admonish a people whom Allah is about to destroy them or punish them with a severe punishment?” (The preachers) replied: “To offer an excuse to your Lord and that they may refrain from disobedience.”"
  7,165,"So when they forgot what they had been reminded with, We rescued those who forbade from evil, but We seized those who did wrong with severe punishment because of what they used to transgress"
  7,166,"But when they persistently did what they were forbidden from it, We told them: “You be detested monkeys.”"
  7,167,"And (remember) when your Lord declared that He would send upon them others who would afflict them with a grievous punishment till the Day of Resurrection. Surely, your Lord is swift in persecution and He is Forgiving, Merciful"
  7,168,"And We dispersed them in the land (as separate) groups among them in the earth: some of them are righteous and others among them are away from that. And We tested them with good blessings and evil calamities in order that they might turn (to Allah)"
  7,169,"Then after them evil successors succeeded who inherited the book, but they chose goods of this low life (evil pleasures of the world) saying (as excuse): “We shall be forgiven.” If similar offer (evil pleasures of the world) comes to them, they would again seize them.

Abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are righteous. Then don’t you understand"
  7,170,"And those who hold fast to the book (act on it) and establish the prayer, Allah will not let the reward of the righteous go waste"
