quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,109,"And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and all the matters go back (for decision) to Allah"
  3,110,"You are the best people raised for mankind. You command the good, forbid the evil, and you believe in Allah. And had people of the Scripture believed, it would have been better for them; some of them are believers, but most of them are transgressors"
  3,111,"They can never harm you except a little (annoyance); if they fight you, they will turn to you the backs, and they will not be helped"
  3,112,"Disgrace will be stamped upon them wherever they are found, except with a covenant (protection) from Allah, a covenant from people; and they have incurred wrath from Allah.

  3,114,"They believe in Allah and the Last Day, they command the good and forbid evil, and they hasten to do good deeds, and they are among the righteous"
  3,115,"And whatever good they do, they will never be denied (its rewards) of good; and Allah knows the pious well"
