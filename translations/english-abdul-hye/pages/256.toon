quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  14,6,"And (remember) when Moses said to his people: “Call to remind Allah’s Favor to you, when He delivered you from Pharaoh’s people who were afflicting you with horrible punishment, were slaughtering your sons and letting your women alive, and in it was a tremendous trial from your Lord.”"
  14,7,"And (remember) when your Lord proclaimed: “If you give thanks, I will give you more (of My Blessings), but if you are ungrateful, surely! My punishment is indeed severe.”"
  14,8,"And Moses said: “If you and all on earth together disbelieve, then surely! (know that) Allah is Rich (free from all needs), Praise-worthy.”"
  14,9,"Has not the news come to you, of those before you, the people of Noah, Ad, and Thamud? Those after them? No one knows them but Allah. Their Messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they put their hands in their mouths (biting with anger) and said: “Surely, we disbelieve in what you have been sent with and we are really in strongly doubt as to what you invite us to it.”"
  14,10,"Their Messengers said: “Can there be a doubt about Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He calls you (to Allah) so that He may forgive you of your sins and give you respite for a term appointed.” They said: “You are not but a human being like us! You wish to turn us away from what our forefathers used to worship. Then bring us a clear authority.”"
