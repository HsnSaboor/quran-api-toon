quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  33,1,"O Prophet (Muhammad)! Fear Allah; don’t obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Surely! Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise"
  33,2,"Follow that which is revealed to you from your Lord. Surely, Allah is well acquainted with what you do"
  33,3,"And put your trust in Allah, and Allah is sufficient as a trustee"
  33,4,"Allah has not put 2 hearts in one person’s body. Neither has He made your wives whom you declare (divorce) through Zihar to be like your mother’s backs, (Zihar is the saying of a husband to his wife: \"you are to me like the back of my mother\" i.e. you are unlawful for me to approach, deprive her rights and keep her like a captive and don’t let her marry anyone else) as your real mothers, nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons. That is your saying with your mouths. But Allah says the truth, and He guides to the Right Way"
  33,5,"Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allah. But if you don’t know their fathers, (call them) your brothers in the religion and your friends. There is no sin on you if you make a mistake in it, except what your hearts deliberately intend. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  33,6,"The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are their (believers’) mothers. Those who are blood relations, some of them are closer to each other in the Decree of Allah (regarding inheritance) than (the brotherhood of) the believers and the emigrants (from Makkah to Madinah), except that you do kindness to your brothers. This has been written in the book (of divine Decrees)"
