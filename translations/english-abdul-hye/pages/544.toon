quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  58,12,"O you who believe! When you wish to consult the Messenger (Muhammad) in private, spend something in charity before your private consultation. That will be better and purer for you. But if you don’t find (anything), then surely, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  58,13,"Are you afraid to spend in charity before your private consultation (with Muhammad)? If you cannot afford, Allah will forgive you; so establish prayer and give obligatory charity and obey Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad). Allah is Well-Aware of what you do"
  58,14,Have you (O Muhammad) not seen those (hypocrites) who take as friends those people who are under the Wrath of Allah? They are neither of you nor of them and they knowingly swear to a lie
  58,15,Allah has prepared for them severe punishment. Indeed evil is that which they do
  58,16,They have taken their oaths as shields (for their evil actions). Thus they hinder people from the Way of Allah. They shall have a humiliating punishment

  58,18,"On the Day when Allah will resurrect them together (for their account), then they will swear to Him as they now swear to you. They think that they are on something (to stand for help). Lo! Surely they are liars"
  58,19,"Satan has overtaken them and caused them to forget the remembrance of Allah. They are the party of Satan. Lo! Surely it is the party of Satan, they will be the losers"
  58,20,"Surely, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad); they will be among the lowest (most humiliated)"
  58,21,"Allah has decreed: “Surely! I and My Messengers will overcome (be victorious).” Surely, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty"
