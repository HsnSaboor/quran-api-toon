quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  7,12,"(Allah) said: “What prevented you (O Satan) that you did not prostrate, when I commanded you?” Satan said: “I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire, and You created him from clay.”"
  7,13,"(Allah) said: “(O Satan) get down from this (Paradise), it is not for you to show arrogance here. Get out; indeed you are of the disgraced ones.”"
  7,14,"(Satan) said: “Allow me respite till the Day (of Resurrection) when they will be raised up.”"
  7,15,"(Allah) said: “Surely, you are granted respite.”"
  7,16,"(Satan) said: “Because You have sent me astray, I will surely sit in ambush for them (human beings) on Your Right Way"
  7,17,"Then I will come to them from front of them and behind them, from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of them as grateful.”"
  7,18,"(Allah) said (to Satan): “Get out from this (Paradise) disgraced and expelled. Whoever of them (mankind) will follow you, surely I will fill hell with you all.”"
  7,19,"(Allah said): “O Adam! Reside with your wife in Paradise, and eat from where you wish, but don’t approach this tree or you both will be of the wrongdoers.”"
  7,20,"But Satan whispered suggestions to them both to expose to them what was concealed to them from their private parts; and he said: “Your Lord has forbidden you from this tree only to prevent you from becoming angels or become of the immortals.”"
  7,21,"And he (Satan) swore to them both (saying): “Surely, I am one of the sincere advisers to you both.”"
  7,22,"So he misled them both with deception. When they both tasted from the tree, both of their private parts (shame) were exposed to them and they began covering (shame) themselves with leaves of Paradise. Their Lord called out to them (saying): “Did I not forbid you from that tree and tell you: surely, Satan is open enemy to you?”"
