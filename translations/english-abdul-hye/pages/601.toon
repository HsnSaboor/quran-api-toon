quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By the time (through the ages)
  103,2,Surely! Mankind is in loss
  103,3,except those who believe and do righteous deeds; exhort one another to the truth and exhort one another to patience
  104,1,Woe to every slanderer and backbiter
  104,2,who gathers wealth and counts it
  104,3,One who thinks that his wealth will make him last forever
  104,4,"Nay! Surely, he will be thrown into the crushing fire"
  104,5,What will make you know what the crushing fire is
  104,6,The fire kindled by Allah
  104,7,The one who will leap up over the hearts
  104,8,"surely, it will close on them (from all sides)"
  104,9,in outstretched pillars (of fire)
  105,1,"Have you (O Muhammad) not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the elephant (The elephant army came under the command of Abraha, king of Yemen, who intended to destroy the Ka’bah at Makkah in the year of Muhammad’s year of birth)"
  105,2,Did He not make their plot go in astray
  105,3,And He sent against them birds in flocks
  105,4,which pelted them with stones of baked clay
  105,5,and He made them like the chewed-up stalks
