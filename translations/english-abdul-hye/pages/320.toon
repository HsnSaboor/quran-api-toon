  20,114,"Then high above is Allah, the True King! Don’t hasten (O Muhammad) with the Qur’an before its revelation is completed to you, and you say: “My Lord! Increase my knowledge.”"
  20,115,"And indeed We made a covenant with Adam before, but he forgot. And We found in him no firm will-power"
  20,116,"And (remember) when We said to the angels: “Prostrate yourselves to Adam.” They prostrated except Satan, who refused"
  20,117,"Then We said: “O Adam! Surely, this is an enemy to you and to your wife. So let him not get you both out from Paradise so that you will be distressed"
  20,118,"Surely, you have (a Promise from Us) that you will neither be hungry in it (Paradise) nor you will be naked"
  20,119,you will neither suffer from thirst in it nor you will suffer from the sun.”
  20,120,"Then Satan whispered to him saying: “O Adam! Shall I lead you to the tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away?”"
  20,121,"Then they both ate from that tree, so their private parts appeared to them, and they began to stick on themselves from leaves of the garden (for covering). Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord, so he went astray"
  20,122,"Then (after repentance) his Lord chose him, turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance"
  20,123,"(Allah) said: “Get down you both together from here (Paradise to earth); some of you are an enemy to some others. If guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My Guidance neither will go astray, nor will fall into distress"
  20,124,"but whoever will turn away from My Remembrance, then surely him will have a life of hardship, and I will raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection.”"
  20,125,"He will say: “O my Lord! Why have you raised me up blind while indeed I had clear sight (before)?”"
