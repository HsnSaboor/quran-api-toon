quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  24,37,"by such people whom neither trade nor sale diverts them from the remembrance of Allah, nor from establishing the prayer, nor from giving the obligatory charity. They fear the Day when the hearts and the eyes will be overturned"
  24,38,"so that Allah may reward them according to the best of what they have done, and add for them even more out of His Grace. And Allah provides without measure to whom He wills"
  24,39,"As for those who disbelieve, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water, until when he comes near it, finds it to be nothing, but finds Allah with him, Who pays (disbeliever’s) due (punishment). And Allah is Swift in taking account"

The one for whom Allah has not made light, there is no light for him"
  24,41,"Don’t you (O Muhammad) see that it is Allah Who is glorified by whoever is in the heavens and the earth, and the birds with wings outspread (in flight)? Each one knows its prayer and glorification, and Allah is All-Aware of what they do"
  24,42,"And to Allah belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and to Allah is the return (of all)"
  24,43,"Don’t you see that Allah drives the clouds, then joins them together, then makes them into a heap of layers, and you see the rain comes forth from between them? He sends down hail like mountains from the sky, and strikes with them whom He wills, and averts from them whom He wills. The flash of its lightning nearly takes away the sight"
