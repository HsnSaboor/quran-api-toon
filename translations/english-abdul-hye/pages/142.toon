quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,111,"Even if We had sent down the angels to them, the dead had spoken to them, and We had gathered before them every thing open (before their eyes), they would not have believed, unless that Allah willed, but most of them are ignorant"
  6,112,"And so We have made for every Prophet an enemy - devils of humans and jinns, inspiring some of them to others with adorned speech as a deception. If your Lord had willed, they would not have done it, so leave them alone with what they fabricate"
  6,113,"so that the hearts of those who don’t believe in the Hereafter may incline (to such deception), and they may be pleased with it; so that they may commit what they wish to commit (sins and evil deeds)"
  6,114,"(Say O Muhammad): “Shall I seek a judge other than Allah who has sent down to you the book (The Qur’an) in details?” Those whom We gave (previously) the Scripture; they know that it is revealed from your Lord in truth. So you should not be of those who doubts"
  6,115,"The Word of your Lord has been perfected in truth and justice. No one can change His Words. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower"
  6,116,"If you obey most of those on the earth, they will mislead you from the Way of Allah. They don’t follow but guess, and they don’t but lie"
  6,117,"Surely, your Lord! It is He Who knows best who strays from His Way, and He knows best the rightly guided ones"
  6,118,So eat of that meat on which the name of Allah has been pronounced (during slaughter) if you are believers in His revelations
