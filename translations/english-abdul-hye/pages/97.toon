quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"There is no good in most of their secret talks except one who commands in charity, or good deeds, or conciliation between people, and who does this, seeking the pleasure of Allah, We shall then give a great reward"
  4,115,"Whoever opposes the Messenger (Muhammad) after what has become clear, and follows the guidance other than the way of the believers, We shall keep him to where he has chosen; burn him in hell - what an evil destination"
  4,116,"Surely! Allah will never forgive the one who associates with Him. But other than that, He forgives whom He wills. Whoever associates others with Allah, has indeed misled misleading far away"
  4,117,"They (Pagan Arabs worship others than Allah) don’t invoke besides Him but female deities, and they don’t invoke but rebellious Satan"

  4,119,"I will mislead them, I will arouse in them false desires, I will order them, and they will cut off ears of the cattle. I will order them and they will change the creation of Allah.” Whoever takes Satan as a guardian besides Allah, certainly has suffered a clear suffering"
  4,120,"He (Satan) makes promises to them, arouses in them false desires, and Satan does not promise them but deception"
  4,121,"These people will have their abode is hell, and they will not find from it an escape"
