quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,59,"And nothing stops Us to send the signs but that the people of old denied them. And We sent the she-camel to Thamud as a clear sign, but they did her wrong. And We don’t send the signs except to warn"
  17,60,"And (remember) when We said to you (O Muhammad): “Surely! Your Lord has encompassed mankind.” And We have not make the vision (Al-Isra) which We showed you (O Muhammad on the night of Al-Isra) but a trial for mankind, and likewise the accursed tree (Zaqqoom) in the Qur’an. We warn them but it does not increase (fear in) them except great disbelief, oppression and disobedience"
  17,61,"And (remember) when We said to the angels: “Prostrate unto Adam.” They prostrated except Satan. He said: “Shall I prostrate to one whom You have created (from) clay?”"
  17,62,"(Satan) said: “Is this the one whom You have honored above me? If You give me respite (keep alive) to the Day of Resurrection, I will surely seize and mislead his (Adam’s) offspring (sending them astray) all but a few!”"
  17,63,"(Allah) said: “Go, and whoever of them follows you, then surely, hell will be the recompense of all of you, an ample recompense"
  17,64,"And befool whom you can of them with your voice, and make assaults on them with your cavalry and your infantry, and share with them in wealth and children, and promise them. But Satan promises them nothing but deception"
  17,65,"Surely! My servants, there is no authority for you over them. Your Lord is All-Sufficient as a Guardian.”"
  17,66,Your Lord is the one who drives your ships in the sea in order that you may seek His Bounty. Surely! He is Merciful towards you
