  10,79,"Pharaoh said: “Bring to me every skilled sorcerer.”"
  10,80,"When the sorcerers came, Moses said to them: “Cast down what you want to cast!”"
  10,81,"Then when they had cast down, Moses said: “What you have brought, it is sorcery; surely Allah will make it invalid. Surely, Allah does not set right the work of the evil-doers"
  10,82,"And Allah will establish and make apparent the truth by His Words, however sinners may hate it.”"
  10,83,"But none believed in Moses except the offspring of his people, because of the fear of Pharaoh and his chiefs, lest he should persecute them; and surely, Pharaoh was an arrogant tyrant on the earth, he was indeed one of the transgressors"
  10,84,"Moses said: “O my people! If you believe in Allah, then put your trust in Him if you are Muslims.”"

  10,87,"And We revealed to Moses and his brother (saying) that: “You provide residences for your people in Egypt, and make your residences as your Qiblah (for worship), and establish prayers perfectly, and give glad tidings to the believers.”"
  10,88,"And Moses said: “Our Lord! You have indeed bestowed on Pharaoh and his chiefs splendor and wealth in the life of this world. Our Lord! Is it because they may lead people astray from Your Way? Our Lord! Destroy their wealth, and harden their hearts, so that they will not believe until they see the painful punishment.”"
