quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,28,Inform them that the water is to be shared between them (and she-camel). Each (one’s right) to drink is being established (by turns)
  54,29,But they (people of Thamud) called one of their comrades who took (responsibility) and killed (she-camel)
  54,30,Then how terrible was My punishment and My warnings
  54,31,"Surely, We sent against them a single punishment (awful cry) and they became like the dry stubble (crushed twigs) of a fence-builder"
  54,32,"And indeed, We have made the Qur’an easy to understand and remember, and is there any who will remember (or take admonition)"
  54,33,The people of Lot denied the warnings
  54,34,"Surely, We sent against them a storm of stones (which destroyed them), except the family of Lot, whom We saved in the last Hour of the night"
  54,35,as a Favor from Us. Thus We do reward those who give thanks (by obeying Us)
  54,36,And indeed he (Lot) had warned them of Our grasp but they doubted the warnings
  54,37,"And indeed they even sought to lure him about his guest (by asking to commit sodomy with them). So We blinded their eyes and said: “Now you taste My punishment and My warnings.”"
  54,38,"And surely, a lasting punishment seized them early in the morning"
  54,39,"(as if to say): “Now you taste My punishment and My warnings.”"
  54,40,"And indeed, We have made the Qur’an easy to understand and remember, and is there any who will remember (or take admonition)"
  54,41,"And indeed, the warnings came to the people of Pharaoh (through Moses and Aaron)"
  54,42,"(They) denied Our all signs. So We seized them with a seizure of the All-Mighty, All-Capable"
  54,43,"Are your disbelievers (O Quraish!) better than these (nations of Noah, Lot, Saleh, and the people of Pharaoh who were destroyed)? Or have you granted immunity (against Our punishment) in the divine Scriptures"
  54,44,"Or do they say: “We are great in numbers, and we shall be victorious?”"
  54,45,"Their huge number will be put to flight, and they will show their backs"
  54,46,"Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time (for recompense), and the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter"
  54,47,"Surely, the criminals are in error (in this world) and will burn (in the hell in the Hereafter)"
  54,48,"The Day when they will be dragged into the fire with their faces downwards, (it will be said to them): “You taste the touch of hell!”"
  54,49,"Surely, We have created all things with divine ordainment"
