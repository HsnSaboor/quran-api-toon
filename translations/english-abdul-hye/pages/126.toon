quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,109,"On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers and will say: “What answer you were given?” They will say: “We have no knowledge, surely, only You (Allah) are All-Knower of hidden things.”"
  5,110,"(Remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): “O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My Favor to you and to your mother when I strengthened you with spirit of the holy (Gabriel), you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and when I taught you the book and the wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel; and when you made from clay like the figure of a bird by My permission, and you breathed into it, and it became a bird by My permission, you healed the born-blind, and the lepers by My permission, when you raised the dead by My permission, when I restrained children of Israel from you when you came to them with clear proofs; and those who disbelieved among them said: This is nothing but clear magic.”"
  5,111,"When I (Allah) revealed to the disciples (of Jesus) to believe in Me and My Messenger, they said: “We believe and bear witness that we are Muslims.”"

  5,113,"They said: “We wish that we eat of it, our hearts be satisfied, we know that you have indeed told us the truth, and we be witnesses on that.”"
