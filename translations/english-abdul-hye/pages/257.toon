quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  14,11,"Their Messengers said to them: “We are not but human beings like you, but Allah bestows His Grace on whom He wills of His servants. It is not for us that we bring you an authority (proof) except by the permission of Allah. And in Allah let the believers put their trust"
  14,12,"And what is the reason for us that we don’t put our trust in Allah while indeed He has guided us our ways? We shall certainly bear with patience what hurt you may cause us, and in Allah (alone) let those who trust, should put their trust.”"
  14,13,"And those who disbelieved said to their Messengers: “Surely, you return to our religion or we will drive you out of our land.” But their Lord revealed to them: “Surely, We shall destroy the wrongdoers"
  14,14,"And indeed, We shall make you reside in the land after them. This is for those who fear standing before Me and also fear My threat.”"
  14,15,"But they (the Messengers) sought help and victory (from Allah), and every stubborn, arrogant dictator (who refused to believe in Allah) was destroyed"
  14,16,Hell is in front of him (dictator) who will be made to drink boiling rotten water
  14,17,"who will sip it (unwillingly) but will find hard to swallow. Death will surround him from every side, yet will not die and in front of him will be a great punishment"
  14,18,"The parable of those who disbelieve in their Lord is that their deeds are like ashes, on which the wind blows furiously on a stormy day; they will not be able to get anything from what they have earned. That will be straying far away (from the Right Way)"
