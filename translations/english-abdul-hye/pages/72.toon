quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,166,"What befalls you on the day (the battle of Uhud) when 2 armies met, was by the permission of Allah in order that He might test the believers"
  3,167,"and that He might know those who were tainted with hypocrisy. It was said to them: “Come, fight in the way of Allah or at least defend (yourselves).” They said: “Had we known that fighting will take place, we would have certainly followed you.” On that day, they were nearer to disbelief than to faith. They said with their mouths what was not in their hearts. Allah has full knowledge of what they conceal"
  3,168,"Those who said about their killed brethren while they sat at home: “If they had listened to us, they would not have been killed.” Say: “Avert the death from your own selves, if you are truthful.”"
  3,169,"Think not of those who are killed in the way of Allah as dead. But they are alive with their Lord, they are well-provided"
  3,170,"They are pleased for what Allah has bestowed upon them out of His Bounty, rejoice for those who have not yet joined them but are left behind (not yet martyred) so that no fear shall come on them and they shall not grieve"
  3,171,"They rejoice at the Favor of Allah’s Bounty, and that Allah does not waste reward of the believers"
  3,172,Those who responded (the call) Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad) after their injury (in the battle of Uhud); there is great reward for such as those who do good and fear Allah
  3,173,"those believers to them the people (hypocrites) said: “Surely, the people (pagans) have gathered against you a great army, so fear them.” But it (only) increased their faith, and they said: “Allah alone is sufficient for us, and He is the excellent Guardian.”"
