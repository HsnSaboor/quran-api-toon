quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  43,11,"and Who sends down water (rain) from the sky in due measure. Then We revive a dead land from it, and even so you will be brought out (from the dead again)"
  43,12,and Who has created all the pairs and has appointed for you from ships and cattle on which you ride
  43,13,"in order that you may mount firmly on their backs, and then may remember the Favor of your Lord when you mount on them, and say: “Glory to Allah who has subjected this to us, and we could never have ability for it (by our efforts)"
  43,14,"and surely, to our Lord we all shall return.”"
  43,15,"Yet they assign to some of His servants a share with Him (as partners). Surely, mankind is clearly ungrateful"
  43,16,"Or has He taken daughters (pagan Arabs used to believe that angels were daughters of Allah) out of what He has created, and has He selected for you sons"
  43,17,"Yet, if the news of one (the birth of a girl) of them is informed which it sets forth as a parable to the Beneficent (Allah), its face becomes dark, gloomy, and is filled with grief"
  43,18,(Do they then like for Allah) a creature who is brought up in ornaments (women) and is unable to make itself clear in dispute
  43,19,And they regard the angels as females who themselves are servants of the beneficent (Allah). Did they witness their creation? Their witness will be recorded and they will be questioned
  43,20,"And they say: “If it had been the Will of the beneficent (Allah), we would not have worshipped them (false deities).” They don’t have any knowledge of that. They don’thing but lie"
  43,21,Or have We given them any book before this (the Qur’an) which they hold fast to it
  43,22,"Nay! They said: “We found our forefathers following on a certain way and religion, and we guide ourselves on their footsteps.”"
