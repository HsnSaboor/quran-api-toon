quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,13,"Or they say: “He (Muhammad) has forged it (the Qur’an).” Say: “Then you bring 10 forged chapters like it, and call whoever you can other than Allah, if you speak the truth"
  11,14,"Then if they don’t answer you, then know that it (the Qur’an) is sent down with the knowledge of Allah and that there is no one worthy of worship except He! Will you then be Muslims?”"
  11,15,Whoever desires the life of the world and its glitter; We shall pay in full to them (the wages of) their deeds therein and they will have no reduction therein
  11,16,They are those there will be nothing for them in the Hereafter but fire and whatever they did (deeds) are in vain. There is no effect of that which they used to do
  11,17,"Can they (be like those) who have clear proof (the Qur’an) from their Lord and to whom a witness (Muhammad) from Him recites it; and before them came the book of Moses, a guidance and a Mercy? They will believe in it, but those of the sects that reject it (the Qur’an); the fire will be their promised meeting place. So don’t be in doubt about it. Surely, it is the truth from your Lord, but most of the mankind does not believe"
  11,18,"Who does more wrong than the one who invents a lie against Allah? Such people will be brought before their Lord and the witnesses will say: “These are the ones who lied against their Lord!” No doubt! The curse of Allah is on the wrongdoers"
  11,19,"those who hinder others from the way of Allah and seek a crookedness therein, they are disbelievers in the Hereafter"
