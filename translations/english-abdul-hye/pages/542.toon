quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  58,1,"Indeed Allah has heard the statement of her (Khawlah, daughter of Tha’labah), who pleaded with you (O Muhammad) against her husband (Aus, son of As-Samit) and she complained to Allah. Allah has heard the conversation between each other. Surely, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Seer"
  58,2,"Those of you who divorce their wives by Zihar (by saying to them “you are like my mother’s back”) (should know that) they cannot be their mothers. Their mothers are only those who gave birth to them. Surely, they say an evil word and a lie. Surely, Allah is Pardoning, Forgiving"
  58,3,"And those who divorce their wives by Zihar, then wish to go back (free themselves) from what they said, the penalty is to free a captive before they touch each other. This is prescribed for you (so that you may not return to such an evil thing). Allah is All-Aware of what you do"
  58,4,"And he who does not find (money for freeing a captive), then must fast for 2 successive months before they both touch each other. For him who is unable to do so (fast), he shall feed 60 poor people. This is (enjoined) in order that you may believe in Allah and His Messenger. These are the limits of Allah. For disbelievers, there is a painful punishment"
  58,5,"Surely, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad); they will be disgraced as those who were disgraced before them (among the past nation). And indeed, We have sent down clear revelations. For the disbelievers, there is a disgracing punishment"
  58,6,On the Day (of judgment) Allah will resurrect them all together and inform them about what they have done. Allah has kept account (of all deeds) while they may have forgotten. Allah is Witness over all things
