quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,23,"No intercession with Him profits anyone except for the one whom He permits. Until when the fear will be removed from their hearts, they (angels) shall say: “What your Lord has said?” They say: “The Truth.” Allah is the High, the Great"
  34,24,"Say (O Muhammad to these polytheists): “Who gives you provision from the heavens and the earth?” Say: “Allah, and surely, (either) we or you are on guidance or in a plain error.”"
  34,25,"Say (O Muhammad to these polytheists): “You will not be asked about our sins, nor we will be asked about your deeds.”"
  34,26,"Say: “Our Lord will assemble us all together (on the Day of Resurrection), then He will judge between us with truth. And He is the Trust-worthy judge, All-Knower of everything.”"
  34,27,"Say (O Muhammad to these polytheists): “Show me those whom you have joined with Him as partners. Nay! But He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”"
  34,28,"And We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a giver of glad tidings and a Warner for all mankind, but most of people don’t know"
  34,29,"And they say: “When is this Promise (the Day of Resurrection will be fulfilled) if you are truthful?”"
  34,30,"Say (O Muhammad): “The appointment Day is fixed, which you can neither put back from it for an Hour nor put forward.”"
  34,31,"And those who disbelieve say: “We don’t believe in this Qur’an nor in that which came before it.” If you could see when the wrongdoers will be made to stand before their Lord, how they will refer the blaming word some of them to others! Those who were deemed weak will say to those who were arrogant: “Had it not been for you, we would certainly have been believers!”"
