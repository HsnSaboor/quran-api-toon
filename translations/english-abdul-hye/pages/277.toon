quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  16,88,"Those who disbelieved and hinder people from the way of Allah, We will add punishment over the punishment for them because they used to spread corruption"
  16,89,"And (remember) the Day when We shall raise up a witness in every nation against them from amongst themselves. And We shall bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against them. (For this reason) We have sent down to you the book (the Qur’an) as an explanation of everything, a guide, a Mercy, and glad tidings for the Muslims"
  16,90,"Surely, Allah enjoins justice, doing good (to others), giving help to kith and kin, and forbids lewdness, evil deeds, and oppression. He admonishes you so that you may take heed"
  16,91,"And fulfill the Covenant of Allah when you have taken a covenant, and don’t break your oaths after you have confirmed them; and indeed you have appointed Allah over you as guarantor. Surely! Allah knows what you do"
  16,92,And don’t be like that (woman) who had spun thread strongly and then undo it by weakening it; nor take your oaths as a means of deception among yourselves so that a nation may take undue advantage over another nation. Only Allah tests you by these (oaths). He will make clear to you on the Day of Resurrection what you used to differ about it
  16,93,"And if Allah willed, He could have made you all one nation, but He sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. Certainly you will be questioned for what you used to do"
