  3,195,"Their Lord answered to them: “I don’t let the good deed of any among you go to waste, whether male or female. Each of you is from the other (offspring). So those who emigrated, or were driven out from their homes, and those who were persecuted in My cause, and who fought, and were killed (in My cause); surely, I will remit from them their evil deeds and will certainly admit them to gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), a reward from Allah. Allah holds best of rewards.”"
