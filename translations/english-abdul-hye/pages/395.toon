quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,78,"He said: “This has been given to me only because of the knowledge that I possess.” Did he (Korah) not know that Allah had destroyed many generations before him, who were stronger in might and greater in collecting (money) than him? But the criminals will not be questioned of their sins (because Allah knows well)"
  28,79,"So (one day) he went out before his people in his pomp (worldly glitter). Those who were desirous of the worldly life, said: “Ah, would that we had the like of what Korah has been given! Surely! He is the owner of a great fortune.”"
  28,80,"But those who had been given the knowledge (of truth) said: “Woe to you! The reward of Allah (in the Hereafter) is better for those who believe and do righteous deeds; and none shall attain it except those who are patient.”"
  28,81,"Then We caused the earth to swallow him along with his residing place. He had no group to help him against Allah, nor was he of those who could save themselves"
  28,82,"And those who had desired his position (of wealth) the day before began to say: “You don’t know that Allah enlarges the provision to whoever He pleases of His servants. If Allah had not been gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us also! You don’t know that the disbelievers will never be successful"
  28,83,"As for the last home (of Paradise), We shall assign to those who neither want pride nor do mischief in the land. The good end is for the pious"
  28,84,"Whoever brings a good deed, shall have the better from it. Whoever brings an evil deed, then those who do evil deeds, will be punished only for what they did"
