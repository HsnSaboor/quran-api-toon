  30,7,"They only know the outside appearance of the life of the world, and they are heedless of the Hereafter"
  30,8,"Don’t they think in their own minds that Allah has created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them with truth and for an appointed term? Indeed many of mankind denies the meeting with their Lord (on the Day of Resurrection)"
  30,9,"Don’t they travel in the land and see how the end of those before them was? They were superior to them in strength, they tilled the earth and populated it in greater numbers than what these (pagans) have populated, and there came to them their Messengers with clear signs. Surely, Allah did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves"
  30,10,Then evil was the end of those who did evil because they denied the Verses of Allah and made a mockery of them

  30,13,No intercessor they will have from their partners (whom they made equal with Allah) and they (themselves) will reject their partners
  30,14,"And on the Day when the Hour (of Judgment) will be established, people will be separated that Day (believers will be separated from the disbelievers)"
  30,15,"Then as for those who believed and did righteous deeds, they shall be honored and made to enjoy luxurious life forever in a garden of delight (Paradise)"
