quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,44,And you (O Muhammad) were not present on the western side (of the mount) when We made the commandment clear to Moses and you were not among the witnesses
  28,45,"But We created many generations (after Moses) and long time has passed over them. You (O Muhammad) were not a resident among the people of Midian, reciting Our Verses to them. But it is We Who is sending (messengers)"
  28,46,"And you (O Muhammad) were not at the side of the Tur mount when We called (Moses); but (provided you with news) as a Mercy from your Lord so that you may warn the people to whom no Warner had come before you, in order that they may remember"
  28,47,"so that if a calamity seizes them (people of Makkah) for what their hands have sent (the deeds), they may not be able to say: “Our Lord! Why You did not send us a Messenger? Then we would have followed Your Verses and would have been among the believers.”"
  28,48,"Now that the truth (Muhammad with his message) has come to them from Us, they say: “Why he is not given the like of what was given to Moses? Did they not disbelieve in what was given to Moses before? They say: “2 kinds of magic (the Torah and the Qur’an) are helping each other!” They say: “Surely! We disbelieve in both.”"
  28,49,"Say (to them, O Muhammad): “Then bring a book from Allah which is better guide than these 2 (the Torah and the Qur’an), I will follow it, if you are truthful.”"
  28,50,"But if they don’t answer to you, then know that they only follow their own desires. Who is more astray than the one who follows own desires without guidance from Allah? Allah does not guide the wrongdoers"
