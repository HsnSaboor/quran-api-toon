quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"Those who disbelieve and hinder people from the Way of Allah, He will render their deeds vain"
  47,2,"But those who believe, do righteous deeds, and believe in what is sent down to Muhammad, for it is the truth from their Lord, He will remove their sins from them, and will make their condition good"
  47,3,"That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, while those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus Allah does set forth their examples for mankind"
  47,4,"So, when you meet (fight with) those who disbelieve, strike at their necks till you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly (and take them as captives). After the war lays down its burden, then either show generosity (free them without ransom), or ransom (to benefit Islam). But if Allah had willed, He could certainly have won over them. But (He adapted this way) in order to test some of you with others. Those who are killed in the Way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost"
  47,5,He will guide them and set their state right
  47,6,and admit them to Paradise which He has made known to them
  47,7,"O you who believe! If you help (the Cause of) Allah, He will help you, and make your foothold firm"
  47,8,"But those who disbelieve, there is destruction for them, and (Allah) will make their deeds vain"
  47,9,"That is because they hate that which Allah has sent down (this Qur’an), so He has made their deeds fruitless"
  47,10,Have they not traveled through the earth and seen how was the end of those before them? Allah destroyed them completely and its likeness (similar fate waits) for the disbelievers
  47,11,That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe and the disbelievers have no protector
