quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  39,6,"He has created you all from a single person (Adam); then made his wife (Eve) from him. He has sent down for you of cattle 8 in pairs. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation in 3 layers of darkness. Such is Allah, your Lord. The kingdom belongs to Him; there is no one worthy of worship but He. How can you then turn away"
  39,7,"If you disbelieve, then surely (know that), Allah does not need you. He does not like disbelief from His servants. If you are grateful (believer), He is pleased with you. No bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another. Then your return is to your Lord. So He will inform you what you did. Surely, He is the All-Knower of that which is in the hearts"
  39,8,"And when some trouble touches people, they cry to their Lord, turning to Him in repentance. But when He bestows a Favor upon them from Him, they forget what they had supplicated (cried) to Him before, and they set up rivals to Allah in order to mislead others from His Way. Say: “Take pleasure in your disbelief for a while. Surely, you will be one of the inmates of the fire!”"
  39,9,"Can the one who is obedient to Allah, prostrating or standing (in prayer) during the Hours of the night, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the Mercy of the Lord (be compared with a disbeliever)? Say: “Are those who know equal to those who don’t know?” It is only people of understanding who will remember"
  39,10,"Say (O Muhammad): “O My servants who believe, be afraid of your Lord and keep your duty (to Him). Good reward is for those who do good in this world, and Allah’s earth is spacious (if you cannot worship Allah at a place, then go to another)! Only those who are patient shall receive their rewards without reckoning.”"
