quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,1,"The praise is for Allah, Who has created the heavens and the earth, and made the darkness and the light; yet those who disbelieve in their Lord, they hold others as equal"
  6,2,"It is He, Who has created you from clay, then decreed a term (you to die) and a determined term (you to be resurrected) with Him, yet you doubt"
  6,3,"And it is the same Allah in the heavens and in the earth, He knows your secret and your open deeds, and He knows what you earn"
  6,4,"Yet never comes to them a sign from Verses of their Lord, but they are turning away from it"
  6,5,"Indeed, they have rejected the truth (the Qur’an and Muhammad) when it came to them. But soon news will come to them of that (the punishment) they used to mock at it"
  6,6,"Have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed before them? We had established them (more powerful) on the earth such as We have not established for you. And We sent rain on them abundantly, and made the rivers flow under them. Then We destroyed them for their sins, and We raised after them other generations"
  6,7,"And if We had sent down to you (O Muhammad) a book written on paper and they could have touched it with their hands, those who disbelieve still would have said: “This is not but obvious magic!”"
  6,8,"And they say: “Why has not an angel been sent down to him?” If We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been decided then, and no respite would have been granted to them"
