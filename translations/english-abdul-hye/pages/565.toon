quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  68,16,We shall brand the one over the nose
  68,17,"Surely, We shall try them as We tried the people of the garden when they swore to pick the fruits of the garden in the morning"
  68,18,"without saying: If Allah wills"
  68,19,Then something (fire) from your Lord passed by on the garden (at night and burnt it) while they were asleep
  68,20,"so the garden became black by the morning, like a pitch dark night (completely ruined)"
  68,21,Then they called out one to another as soon as the morning broke
  68,22,"saying: “Go to your tilth in the morning if you want to pick the fruits.”"
  68,23,So they departed and whispered in secret low tones (saying)
  68,24,“Let no poor person enter into the garden today.”
  68,25,"And then they went in the morning with strong intention, thinking that they have powers (to prevent the poor from taking any of the fruits)"
  68,26,"But when they saw the garden, they said: “Surely, we have gone astray"
  68,27,"(then they said): Nay! Indeed we have been deprived (of the fruits)!”"
  68,28,"The best among them said: “Did I not tell you: why do you not glorify Allah (If Allah wills)?”"
  68,29,"They said: “Glory to our Lord! Surely, we have been wrongdoers.”"
  68,30,So they started blaming one another
  68,31,"(Later) they said: “Woe to us! Surely, we had become transgressors"
  68,32,"We hope that our Lord will give us in exchange a better garden than this. Truly, we turn to our Lord.”"
  68,33,"Such is the punishment (in this life) and truly, the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they but knew"
  68,34,"Surely, the pious will be rewarded with gardens of delight (Paradise) by their Lord"
  68,35,Shall We then treat the Muslims like the criminals
  68,36,What is the matter with you? How do you judge
  68,37,Or do you have a book from which you learn
  68,38,that you shall have in it all that you choose
  68,39,Or do you have oaths from Us reaching to the Day of Resurrection that your will have whatever you judge
  68,40,Ask if anyone of them will Promise for that
  68,41,Or do they have ‘partners (other deities besides Allah)?’ Then let them bring their ‘partners’ if they are truthful
  68,42,"(Remember) the Day (of Judgment) when the events shall be unfolded and they shall be called to prostrate (to Allah), but they shall not be able to do so"
