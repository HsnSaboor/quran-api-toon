quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  76,26,prostrate yourself to Him at night and glorify Him during long night Hours
  76,27,Surely! These disbelievers love the present life of this world and leave behind them a heavy Day (that will come)
  76,28,"It is We Who created them and made their joints strong. But if We will, We can replace (them) like them with a complete replacement"
  76,29,"Surely! This (Verses of the Qur’an) is an admonition, so those who will, let them adapt the Way to their Lord"
  76,30,"but you cannot will, unless Allah wills. Surely, Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise"
  76,31,"He admits to His Mercy whom He wills, and for the wrongdoers He has prepared a painful punishment"
  77,1,By the emissary winds (sent forth) one after another
  77,2,by the raging hurricanes
  77,3,by (the winds) that scatter (the clouds) to distant places
  77,4,then separate them one from another
  77,5,by those (angels) who bring down the reminder (to the Messengers)
  77,6,either to (remove all) excuses or to (covey the) warning
  77,7,"Surely, what you are promised must be fulfilled"
  77,8,(It will be fulfilled) when the stars will lose their light
  77,9,when the heaven will cleft asunder
  77,10,when the mountains will blow away (into dust)
  77,11,when the Messengers will be gathered to their appointed time
  77,12,For what Day are these signs deferred
  77,13,For the Day of sorting out (judgment)
  77,14,"What will make you know, what is the Day of sorting out"
  77,15,Woe on that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)
  77,16,Did We not destroy the previous generations (for evil deeds)
  77,17,Then We shall make later generations to follow them
  77,18,Thus We will deal with the criminals
  77,19,Woe on that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)
