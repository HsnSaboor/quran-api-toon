quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the dawn
  89,2,by the 10 nights (first 10 days of the month of Dhul-Hijja)
  89,3,by the even and the odd (of all the creations of Allah)
  89,4,and by the night when it departs
  89,5,Are there not in them (above oaths) sufficient proofs for the people of understanding
  89,6,Have you (O Muhammad) not seen how your Lord dealt with Ad (people)
  89,7,(Tall residents of) Iram with lofty pillars
  89,8,the like of which were not created like them in the land
  89,9,"With Thamud (people), who cut out rocks in the valley (to make residences)"
  89,10,With Pharaoh who had the stakes
  89,11,They all transgressed beyond bounds in the lands
  89,12,and made much mischief in it
  89,13,So your Lord poured on them different kinds of punishment
  89,14,"Surely, your Lord is ever watchful (over them)"
  89,15,"As for people, when their Lord tries them and gives them honor and bounties, they say: “Our Lord has honored us.”"
  89,16,"But when He tries them through restricting their means of life, then they say: “Our Lord has humiliated us!”"
  89,17,Nay! But you did not treat the orphans with kindness and generosity
  89,18,nor did you encourage each other in feeding the poor
  89,19,You devour inheritance (of the weak) with greed
  89,20,and you love wealth with much love
  89,21,Nay! When the earth will be grounded to exceeding grinding (powder)
  89,22,your Lord will come with the angels standing in rows
  89,23,"hell will be brought near (in sight) that Day. On that Day people will remember (their deeds), but how the remembrance will avail them"
