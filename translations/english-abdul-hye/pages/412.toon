quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  31,12,"And indeed We bestowed upon Luqman the wisdom (saying): “Give thanks to Allah,” and those who give thanks, they only give thanks for their own self. And whoever is ungrateful (should know that) surely Allah is Rich, Praise-Worthy"
  31,13,"And (remember) when Luqman was advising his son, said to him: “O my son! Don’t join in worship others with Allah. Surely! Joining others in worship with Allah is a great wrong indeed.”"
  31,14,"And We have enjoined on people (to be dutiful) to their parents. Each mother carries her child in her womb while suffering in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and then weans the child in 2 years that: “You give thanks to Me and to your parents, to Me is the final destination"
  31,15,"If they both strive against you to make you join in worship others with Me of which you have no knowledge, then don’t obey them; but behave with them kindly in this world, and follow the way of those who turn to Me in repentance and in obedience. To Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you have done.”"
  31,16,"(Luqman said): “O my son! Indeed if it (anything) is equal to the weight of a grain of mustard seed, and though it is in a rock, or in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it out. Surely, Allah is Subtle (able to make fine distinction), Well-Aware (of all things)"
  31,17,"O my son! Establish the prayer, enjoin good, forbid evil, and bear with patience whatever befalls you. Surely! These are some of the important commandments"
  31,18,"And don’t turn your face away (with pride) from people, nor walk in pride on the earth. Surely, Allah does not like any arrogant boaster"
  31,19,"And be moderate (no pride) in your walking and lower your voice. Surely, the harshest of all voices is indeed the voice of the donkey.”"
