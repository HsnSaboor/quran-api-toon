  3,180,"Don’t think those who greedily withhold (charity) which Allah has granted them of His Bounty (wealth), it is good for them, but it is bad for them. They will be hung around their necks what they greedily withheld from their wealth on the Day of Resurrection. For Allah is the heritage of the heavens and the earth. Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do"
