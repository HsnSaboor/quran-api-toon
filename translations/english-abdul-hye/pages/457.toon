quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  38,62,"They will say (to each other): “What is the matter with us that we don’t see those people whom we used to count among the bad ones"
  38,63,"Did we take them as an object of mockery, or our eyes failed to perceive them?”"
  38,64,"Surely, that is the very truth: the people of the fire will have mutual dispute (common habit)"
  38,65,"Say (O Muhammad): “I am only a Warner and there is no one worthy of worship except Allah, the One, the Irresistible"
  38,66,"the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, the Mighty, the Forgiving.”"
  38,67,"Say: “That (the Qur’an) is a great news"
  38,68,from which you turn away!”
  38,69,"(Say): “I had no knowledge of the exalted chiefs (angels) when they disputed (about the creation of Adam)"
  38,70,This is inspired to me with that I am only a plain Warner.”
  38,71,"(Remember) when your Lord said to the angels: “Surely, I am going to create a man from clay"
  38,72,"so when I have fashioned him and breathed into him (his soul) from me, then you fall down to him and prostrate.”"
  38,73,"So the angels prostrated, all of them together"
  38,74,"except Satan, he was proud and was one of the disbelievers"
  38,75,"(Allah) said: “O Satan! What prevents you from prostrating to one whom I have created with My own hands? Are you too proud or are you of the high exalted?”"
  38,76,"(Satan) said: “I am better than he, You created me from fire, and You created him from clay.”"
  38,77,"(Allah) said: “Then get out from here, for surely, you are accursed"
  38,78,and surely! My curse shall be on you till the Day of recompense.”
  38,79,"(Satan) said: “My Lord! Then give me respite till the Day is resurrected.”"
  38,80,"(Allah) said: “Surely! You are of those allowed respite"
  38,81,till the Day of the time appointed.”
  38,82,"(Satan) said: “By Your might, I will surely mislead them all"
  38,83,except Your chosen (faithful) devotees amongst them.”
