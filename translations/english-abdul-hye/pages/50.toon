  3,4,"before as a guidance for mankind. And He sent down Al-Furqan (the criterion to judge between right and wrong (this Qur’an)). Surely, those who disbelieve in the Verses of Allah, for them there is a severe punishment; and Allah is All-Mighty, All-Able of retribution"

  3,7,"It is He who has sent down to you (Muhammad) the book (this Qur’an). In it are Verses absolutely clear, they are the basis of the book; and others are not entirely clear. As for those in whose hearts there is deviation (from the truth), they follow what is unclear thereof, seeking mischief, and seeking for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allah. And those who are firmly rooted in knowledge say: “We believe in it, all from our Lord.\" None will heed except the people of understanding"
