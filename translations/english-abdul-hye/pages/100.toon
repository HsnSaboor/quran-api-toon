quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,135,"O you who believe! You stand firm for justice as witnesses for Allah, though it is against yourselves, or parents, and relatives whether the party is rich or poor; Allah has more right than both of them. So you don’t follow your desires to do injustice. If you distort (facts) or you refrain, then (you should know that) Allah is Well-Aware of what you do"
  4,136,"O you who believe! Believe in Allah, and His Messenger (Muhammad), and the book (the Qur’an) which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He has sent down before. Whoever disbelieves in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed is mislead a misleading far away"
  4,137,"Surely, those who believe, then disbelieve, then believe again, and again disbelieve, then increase in their disbelief; Allah will neither forgive them, nor will guide them on the Right Way"
  4,138,Give tidings to the hypocrites that for them there is painful punishment
  4,139,"those who take the disbelievers as allies instead of believers. Do they seek honor for them? Surely, the honor is for Allah all together"
  4,140,"And indeed He has sent down to you in the Scripture (this Qur’an) that when you hear the Verses of Allah being rejected and being mocked at, then you don’t sit with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; otherwise indeed you are like them. Surely, Allah will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers in hell all together"
