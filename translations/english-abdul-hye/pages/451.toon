quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"But they denied him (Elias), so they will certainly be brought forth (to the punishment)"
  37,128,except the chosen (faithful) devotees of Allah
  37,129,We left for him (a good name) among later generations (to come)
  37,130,Peace be upon Elias
  37,131,"Surely, thus We reward the righteous people"
  37,132,"Surely, he was one of Our believing devotees"
  37,133,"Surely, Lot was one of the Messengers"
  37,134,When We saved him and all his family
  37,135,except an old woman (who was) among those who remained behind
  37,136,then We destroyed the rest (the towns of Sodom at the Dead Sea in Jordan)
  37,137,"Surely, you pass by them in the morning"
  37,138,and at night; will you not then reflect (think)
  37,139,"Surely, Jonah was one of the Messengers"
  37,140,When he ran to the laden ship
  37,141,"he (agreed to) cast lots, and he was among the losers"
  37,142,Then a (big) fish swallowed him while he had done an act worthy of blame
  37,143,Had it not been that he was of those who glorify (Allah)
  37,144,he would have indeed remained in its belly (the fish) till the Day of Resurrection
  37,145,Then We cast him out on the naked shore while he was sick
  37,146,and We caused a plant of gourd (squash) to grow over him
  37,147,"Then We had sent him to a nation of 100,000 people or even more"
  37,148,They believed; so We gave them enjoyment for a while
  37,149,"Now ask them (disbelievers, O Muhammad): (Does it make sense that) your Lord should have only daughters while they choose to have sons"
  37,150,Or did We create the angels as females while they were witnesses
  37,151,"Surely, they invent a lie when they say"
  37,152,"“Allah has begotten (children). Surely, they are liars!”"
  37,153,Has He chosen daughters (rather than) sons
