  23,90,"But nay, We have brought them the truth, and surely, they (disbelievers) are liars"
  23,91,"Allah did not beget any son, nor is there anyone worthy of worship along with Him. Behold, (if there had been many deities) each would have taken away what each had created, and some of them would have tried to overcome others! Glorified is Allah above all that they attribute to Him"
  23,92,(Allah is) All-Knower of the unseen and the seen! Exalted is He over all that they associate as partners to Him
  23,93,"Say (O Muhammad): “My Lord! If You would show me that with which they are being threatened"
  23,94,my Lord! Then don’t put me amongst the people who are the wrongdoers.”
  23,95,And indeed We are able to show you (O Muhammad) that with which We have threatened them
  23,96,Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with what they utter
  23,97,"And say: “My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings of the devils"

  23,100,"so that I may do good in that which I have left behind!” No! It is but a word that he speaks, and behind them is a barrier until the Day when they will be resurrected"
  23,101,"Then, when the trumpet is blown, there will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another"
  23,102,"Then those who are heavy in their scales (of good deeds), they are the successful"
  23,103,"Those who are light in their scales, they are those who lost their own selves, in hell they will abide"
  23,104,"The fire will burn their faces, and they will grin (smile broadly) in it with displaced lips (disfigured)"
