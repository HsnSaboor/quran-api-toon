quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  20,88,"Then he took out (of the fire) for them (statue of) a calf body and it had a low sound. Then said: ‘This is your one worthy of worship, and the deity of Moses, but (Moses) has forgotten (his deity).’”"
  20,89,"Did they not see that it could not return to them a word (for answer), nor it had power for them to harm nor help"
  20,90,"And indeed Aaron had said to them before: “O my people! Only you are being tried with it, and surely, your Lord is the Gracious, so you follow me and obey my order.”"
  20,91,"They said: “We will never stop worshipping it (the calf), until Moses returns to us.”"
  20,92,"He (Moses) said: “O Aaron! What stopped you when you saw them going astray"
  20,93,that you did not follow me? Have you then disobeyed my order?”
  20,94,"He (Aaron) said: “O son of my mother! You don’t seize me by my beard, or by my head! Surely, I feared lest you should say: ‘You have caused a division between children of Israel, and you did not respect my word!’”"
  20,95,"(Moses) said: “Then what is the matter with you, O Samiri?”"
  20,96,"(Samiri) said: “I saw what they did not see, so I seized a handful (of dust) from the footprint of the Messenger (angel) and then threw it (into the casting of the calf). This my inner soul suggested to me.”"
  20,97,"(Moses) said: “Then go away! Surely, (the punishment) for you in this life is that you will say: ‘Don’t touch me (you will live alone in exile away from mankind)’; and surely you have a promise (of future punishment) that will not fail. Look at your deity which you have been devoted to it. Certainly we will burn it, and then certainly we will scatter its particles in the sea.”"
  20,98,"(Then Moses told his people): “Your One worthy of worship is only Allah; there is no one worthy of worship but He. He comprehends every thing in knowledge.”"
