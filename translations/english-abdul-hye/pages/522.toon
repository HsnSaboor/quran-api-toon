quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"He (Abraham) said: “For what purpose you have come, O Messengers?”"
  51,32,"They said: “We have been sent to a criminal people (of prophet Lot, who were homosexuals)"
  51,33,to send down upon them stones of baked clay
  51,34,marked by your Lord for those who transgress Allah’s limits.”
  51,35,So We brought out all those who were believers in the town
  51,36,but We found none in it except one household of the Muslims (Lot and his 2 daughters)
  51,37,and We left in it a sign (the Dead Sea in Palestine) for those who fear the painful punishment
  51,38,"And (There is sign in the story) of Moses, when We sent him to Pharaoh with a clear authority"
  51,39,"but he (Pharaoh) turned away (from belief) with his hosts and said: “A sorcerer, or a madman.”"
  51,40,"So, We took him and his hosts, and dumped them into the sea. Indeed he deserved to be blamed"
  51,41,"(There is sign in the story) of Ad, when We sent against them the barren wind"
  51,42,which spared nothing that it reached and it blew on like something rotten (decayed)
  51,43,"And (there is sign in the story) of Thamud, when it was said to them: “Enjoy yourselves for a while (3 days),”"
  51,44,but they disobeyed the command of their Lord with arrogance; so the awful cry overtook them while they were looking
  51,45,So neither they were able to rise up nor could they help themselves
  51,46,"(Allah destroyed) the people of Noah before them. Surely, they were people who were rebellious, disobedient (to Allah)"
  51,47,"Allah has built the heaven with power. Surely, We are Able to extend the vastness of space in it"
  51,48,"And We have spread out the earth, how Excellent Spreader are We"
  51,49,"We have created everything in pairs, so that you may remember (Allah)"
  51,50,"(Say to mankind, O Muhammad):“Rush towards Allah, surely, I (Muhammad) am from Him a plain Warner to you"
  51,51,"And don’t set up any other one worthy of worship with Allah. Surely, I (Muhammad) am from Him a plain Warner to you.”"
