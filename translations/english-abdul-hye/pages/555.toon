quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"When it is said to them: “Come, so that the Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness from Allah for you,” they turn aside their heads and you see them turning away (their faces) while they are in pride"
  63,6,"It is equal to them whether you (Muhammad) ask forgiveness for them or don’t ask forgiveness for them. Allah will not forgive them. Surely, Allah does not guide the people who are disobedient"
  63,7,"They are the ones who say: “Don’t spend on those who are with the Messenger of Allah, until they desert him.” To Allah belongs the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites don’t comprehend"
  63,8,"They (hypocrites) say: “If we return to Madinah, indeed the more honorable (Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul, the chief hypocrite at Madinah) will expel from there the meaner (Allah’s Messenger).” But honor, power and glory belong to Allah, and to His Messenger (Muhammad), and to the believers, but the hypocrites don’t know"
  63,9,"O you who believe! Let neither your properties nor your children distract you from the remembrance of Allah. Those who will do so, then they are the real losers"
  63,10,"Spend (in charity) of that which We have provided you before death comes to one of you who says: “My Lord! If only You would give me respite for a little while (return to the worldly life), then I would give in charity, and be among the righteous.”"
  63,11,And Allah never grants respite to a soul when its appointed time (death) comes to an end. Allah is All-Aware of what you do
