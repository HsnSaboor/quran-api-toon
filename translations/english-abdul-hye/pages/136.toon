quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,69,"Those who fear Allah are not responsible from their (wrongdoers’) actions anything, but remind them so that they (wrongdoers) may fear Allah"
  6,70,"And leave alone those who take their religion as a play and amusement, and are deceived by the life of this world. But remind them with it (the Qur’an) lest their souls are caught for what they have earned. Neither will be for them besides Allah a protector nor an intercessor, and even if they offer ransom for every ransom, it will not be accepted from them. They are those who are caught for what they earned. For them will be a drink of boiling water and a painful punishment because they used to disbelieve"
  6,71,"Say (O Muhammad to the disbelievers): “Shall we invoke others besides Allah that can neither benefit us nor can harm us? Shall we turn on our heels after when Allah has guided us? Like those whom the Satan has misled in the earth confused, their companions call them to the guidance (saying): ‘Come to us.’” Say: “Surely, the Guidance of Allah is the only guidance, and we are commanded that we submit (become Muslims) to the Lord of the worlds"
  6,72,"to offer prayer, fear Allah, and it is He to Whom you shall be gathered.”"
  6,73,"It is He who has created the heavens and the earth in truth and on the Day (of Resurrection) He will say: “Be!” and it shall become. His word is the truth. The dominion will be His on the Day when the trumpet will be blown. He knows all the invisible and the visible. He is the Wise, aware of everything"
