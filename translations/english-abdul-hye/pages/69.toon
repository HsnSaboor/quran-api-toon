  3,149,"O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will drive you back on your heels, and you will turn back (from faith to disbelief) as losers"
  3,150,"But Allah is your Protector, and Allah is the Best of the helpers"
  3,151,"We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because they associated (others in worship) with Allah, whom He has not sent any authority. Their abode is the fire and evil is the abode of the wrongdoers"
  3,152,"Indeed Allah was truthful in His Promise to you when you were destroying them (your enemy in the battle of Uhud) with His permission, until when you showed weakness and fell into dispute about the order, and disobeyed (the prophet) after what He showed you (the booty) which you loved. There were some among you who desire this world and some of you who desire the Hereafter. Then He made you flee from them (your enemy) so that He may test you. Surely, He forgave you, and Allah is Gracious to the believers"
  3,153,"(Remember) when you were running away (flee to hills) without even looking a glace at anyone, and the Messenger (Muhammad) was calling you back in your rear. Allah gave you grief for grief (to teach lesson) so that you may neither grief over what you escaped, nor on (misfortune) which had befallen you. Allah is Well-Aware of what you do"
