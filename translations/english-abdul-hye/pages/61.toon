  3,84,"Say (O Muhammad): “We believe in Allah, what has been sent down to us, what was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendents, and what was given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets from their Lord. We don’t make distinction between any one of them and to Him we submit (in Islam).”"

  3,90,"Surely, those who disbelieve after their belief, then grow in disbelief, their repentance will never be accepted. They are those who are astray"
  3,91,"Surely, those who disbelieve, and die while they are disbelievers, will not be accepted from any one of them even if they offer earth of gold as ransom. For them (will be) a painful punishment and will have no helpers"
