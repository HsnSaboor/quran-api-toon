quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,15,"Indeed for the people of Sheba (a town in Yemen) there was a sign in their residing place: 2 gardens - one on the right and one on the left. (It was said to them): “Eat of the provision of your Lord and be grateful to Him, a fair land and a Forgiving Lord.”"
  34,16,"But they turned away (from Allah). So We sent against them a flood of Arim (released water from the dam), and We converted their 2 gardens into gardens producing bitter fruits, shrubs, and some few lote-trees"
  34,17,This is how We punished them because they were ungrateful (disbelievers). And We never punish except those who are ungrateful
  34,18,"And We placed between them and between the towns which We had blessed, towns easy to be seen, and We made easy stages of journey between them (saying): “Travel in them safely night and day.”"
  34,19,"But they said: “Our Lord! Make the stages longer between our journeys.” They wronged themselves, so We made them (in the land) as tales, and We dispersed them in a total scattering. Surely, there are signs for every patient, grateful person"
  34,20,And indeed Satan did prove its thought true about them and they all followed him except a group of believers
  34,21,And there was no authority for him (Satan) over them except that We might test him who believes in the Hereafter from him who is in doubt about it. Your Lord is watching over everything
  34,22,"Say (O Muhammad to those polytheists): “Call upon those (deities) whom you assert besides Allah, they don’t possess even the weight of an atom in the heavens or on the earth, nor they have any share in either, nor there is any supporter from among them for Him.”"
