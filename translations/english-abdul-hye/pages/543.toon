quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  58,7,"Are you not aware that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth? There is no secret counsel of 3, but He is their 4th (with His knowledge), nor of 5 but He is their 6th, nor of less than that or more, but He is with them wherever they may be. Then on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they did. Surely, Allah is All-Knower of everything"
  58,8,"Have you not seen those who were forbidden from secret counsels, and afterwards they returned to what they were forbidden from it? They conspired together for sin, wrong doing, and disobedience to the Messenger (Muhammad). Yet, when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting with which Allah does not greet you, and they say to themselves: “Why Allah does not punish us for what we say?” Hell will be sufficient for them, they will burn in it, and worst indeed is that destination"
  58,9,"O you who believe! When you hold secret counsel, don’t hold secret council for sin, wrong-doing, and disobedience towards the Messenger (Muhammad); but hold secret council for righteousness and piety; and fear Allah to whom you shall be gathered"
  58,10,Secret counsels (conspiracies) are only from Satan so that he may cause grief to those who believe. But he cannot harm them in anything except with the permission of Allah. In Allah let the believers put their trust
  58,11,"O you who believe! When you are asked to make room in the assemblies, (spread out) make room. Allah will make room (from His Mercy) for you (Hereafter). When you are told to rise up (His cause), then rise up. Allah will elevate those of you who believe and those who have been granted knowledge in degrees. Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do"
