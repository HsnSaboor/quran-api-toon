quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  46,6,"And when mankind shall be gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become enemies for them and will deny their worshipping"
  46,7,"And when Our clear revelations are recited to them, and the truth (this Qur’an) reaches them, the disbelievers say: “This is plain magic!”"
  46,8,"Or they say: “He (Muhammad) has fabricated it.” Say: “If I have fabricated it, then you have no power to support me in anything against (the Wrath of) Allah. He knows better of what you say among yourselves concerning it (this Qur’an)! He is sufficient as a witness between me and between you! And He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.”"
  46,9,"Say (O Muhammad): “I am not a new thing among the Messengers (of Allah) and I don’t know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow what is revealed to me, and I am not but a plain Warner.”"
  46,10,"Say: “Do you see, if this (Qur’an) is from Allah and you deny it, and a witness from the children of Israel (Abdullah bin Salam) has testified to its similarity (that this Qur’an is from Allah like the Torah), and he has believed (embraced Islam), while you are too proud (to believe). Surely! Allah does not guide the wrongdoers.”"
  46,11,"And those who disbelieve (strong and wealthy) say to those who believe (weak and poor): “Had it (the Qur’an) been a good thing, they (believers) would not have believed in it before us!” Since they did not accept its guidance (this Qur’an), they say: “This is an ancient lie!”"
  46,12,"And from before, this was the Scripture of Moses as a guide and a Mercy. This book (the Qur’an) confirms it. It is revealed in the Arabic language to warn those who do wrong, and as glad tidings to the righteous people"
  46,13,"Surely, those who say: “Our Lord is (only) Allah,” and thereafter stand firm, there shall be no fear on them, nor they shall grieve"
  46,14,"They shall be the residents of Paradise, abide in it forever, a reward for what they used to do"
