quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,10,"Those who disbelieve and deny Our Verses, they will be companions of hellfire"
  5,11,"O you who believe! Remember the Favor of Allah upon you when some people decided (made a plan) that they stretch (harm) you with their hands, but (Allah) held back their hands from you. So fear Allah. In Allah let the believers put their trust"
  5,12,"Surely Allah took a covenant from the children of Israel, and We appointed among them 12 leaders. And Allah said: “Certainly I am with you if you establish the prayer, you pay obligatory charity, you believe in My Messengers, you assist them, and you lend to Allah a good loan (spend in charity). Surely, I will wipe out from you your evil deeds, and will surely admit you to gardens under them the rivers flow (in Paradise). But whoever disbelieved after this among you, indeed he has gone astray from Right Way.”"
  5,13,"Then for their breach of their covenant, We cursed them, and made their hearts hard. They changed the words from their right context and they forgot a part of message what they were cautioned of it. You will not cease to discover treachery from them, except a few of them. But forgive them, and overlook (their misdeeds). Surely, Allah loves those who do good deeds"
