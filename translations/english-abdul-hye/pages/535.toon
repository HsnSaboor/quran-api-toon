quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,immortal youths will go round serving them
  56,18,"with cups, jugs, and glasses of flowing wine"
  56,19,"from where they will neither get any pain of the head, nor they will get any intoxication"
  56,20,(They will have) fruits of their own choice
  56,21,and the flesh of fowls that they may desire
  56,22,and Huris (chaste virgins) with wide lovely eyes
  56,23,like guarded pearls
  56,24,as a reward for what they used to do (good deeds)
  56,25,They will neither hear any vain talk therein nor any sinful speech
  56,26,but the saying of Salam! Salam! (greetings with peace)
  56,27,And those on the right hand who will be those on the right hand
  56,28,(They will be) among thornless lote-trees
  56,29,and among banana trees with fruits piled one above another
  56,30,and in long-extended shade
  56,31,and by water flowing constantly
  56,32,and fruit in plenty
  56,33,whose season is not limited and their supply will not be cut off
  56,34,and on high raised couches or thrones
  56,35,"Surely, We have created them (maidens) of special creation"
  56,36,and made them virgins
  56,37,"loving (their husbands only), equal in age"
  56,38,for those on the right hand
  56,39,A large number will be from the first generation (who embraced Islam)
  56,40,and a large number will be from the later generations
  56,41,And those on the left hand - will be those on the left hand
  56,42,(They will be) in fierce hot wind and boiling water
  56,43,and in the shadow of black smoke
  56,44,"(that shadow is) neither cool, nor good"
  56,45,"Surely, they were indulged in luxury before"
  56,46,and were persisting in great sin
  56,47,"and they used to say: “When we die and become dust and bones, shall we then indeed be resurrected"
  56,48,and also our forefathers?”
  56,49,"Say (O Muhammad): “Surely, those of old, and those of later times"
  56,50,all will surely be gathered together to an appointed meeting of well known Day
