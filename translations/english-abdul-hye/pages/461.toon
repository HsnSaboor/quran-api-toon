quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,Is the one whose heart Allah has opened to Islam and is in light from its Lord (same as one who disbelieves)? So woe to those whose hearts are hardened against remembrance of Allah! They are in plain error
  39,23,"Allah has sent down the best statement, a book (this Qur’an), its parts resemble each other, often repeated. The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver from it. Then their skins and their hearts soften to the remembrance of Allah. Such is the guidance of Allah. He guides whom He pleases and whomever He sends astray, there is no guide for him"
  39,24,"Is the one who will confront with the awful punishment on the Day of Resurrection (same as one who enters peacefully into Paradise)? It will be said to the wrongdoers: “Taste what you earned!”"
  39,25,"Those who also denied before them, the punishment came on them from where they did not perceive"
  39,26,"So Allah made them to taste the disgrace in the present life, but the punishment of the Hereafter is greater if they only knew"
  39,27,And indeed We have put forth every kind of example for mankind in this Qur’an in order that they may remember
  39,28,It is an Arabic Qur’an without any crookedness (flaw) in it in order that they may avoid all evil
  39,29,"Allah puts forth an example: a captive belongs to many partners disputing with one another (like one who believes in many false deities), and a captive belongs entirely to one master (like one believes in one Allah). Are these 2 equal in comparison? All the praise be to Allah! But most of them don’t know"
  39,30,"Surely, you (O Muhammad) will die and surely, they too will die"
  39,31,"Then surely on the Day of Resurrection, you will dispute (to settle) before your Lord"
