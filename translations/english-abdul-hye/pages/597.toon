  95,1,By the fig and by the olive
  95,2,by the mount of Sinai
  95,3,and by this city of security (Makkah)
  95,4,"Surely, We have created people in the best stature"
  95,5,then We will reduce it to the lowest of the low
  95,6,"except those who believe (in Islam) and do righteous deeds, then for them will be a reward without end (Paradise)"
  95,7,"So, what causes you (disbelievers) to deny about the Day of Judgment"
  95,8,Is not Allah the best of the judges
  96,1,"Read! In the name of your Lord, who has created (everything)"
  96,2,created human from a clot (thick blood)
  96,3,Read! Your Lord is the Generous
  96,4,who has taught (writing) by the pen
  96,5,taught human what it did not know
  96,6,"Nay! Surely, human does transgress"

  96,9,Have you seen him (Abu Jahl) who prevents
  96,10,a servant (Muhammad) from offering prays
  96,11,Have you seen if he (Muhammad) is on the guidance (of Allah)
  96,12,or enjoins piety
  96,13,Have you seen if he (Abu Jahl) denies (truth) and turn away
  96,14,Does he (Abu Jahl) not know that Allah sees (everything)
  96,15,"Nay! If he (Abu Jahl) does not stop, We will catch him by the forelock"

  96,17,So let him call his council (of help)
  96,18,We will call out the guards of hell (to deal with him)
  96,19,Nay! (O Muhammad)! Don’t obey him (Abu Jahl). Prostrate and draw near (to Allah)
