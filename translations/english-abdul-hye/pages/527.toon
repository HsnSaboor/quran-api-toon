quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,"Surely those who don’t believe in the Hereafter, name the angels with female names"
  53,28,But they have no knowledge of it. They follow but a guess; and surely guess does not substitute for the truth at all
  53,29,"Therefore, withdraw (O Muhammad) from those who turn away from Our reminder (this Qur’an) and they only desire the life of this world"
  53,30,"This is their highest point of knowledge. Surely, your Lord is He Who knows those best who go astray from His Way, and He knows those best who receive guidance"
  53,31,"And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, so that He may requite those who do evil with what they have done (punish them in hell), and reward those who do good with what is best (Paradise)"
  53,32,"Those who avoid major sins and shameful deeds except the small faults; surely, for them your Lord will have abundant forgiveness. He knew you well when He created you from the earth and when you were fetuses in your mother’s wombs. So don’t scribe piety to yourselves. He knows best who fears (Him)"
  53,33,"Have you (O Muhammad) seen the one who (Waleed bin Mugheerah, who wanted to accept Islam but someone Promised him to take the punishment on his behalf for certain amount of money, he) turned away (from Islam)"
  53,34,"He gave a little (amount of money), then he stopped (giving)"
  53,35,Does he has the knowledge of the unseen so that he sees (the reality)
  53,36,Or has he not been informed about what was in the pages (Scripture) of Moses
  53,37,and of Abraham who fulfilled (his covenant)
  53,38,“That no burdened person (with sins) shall bear the burden of another
  53,39,that a human can have nothing except what he strives for
  53,40,that one’s efforts will be seen (checked)
  53,41,that one will be fully recompensed and the best recompense
  53,42,that to your Lord is the end
  53,43,that it is He Who makes laugh and makes weep
  53,44,that it is He Who causes death and gives life
