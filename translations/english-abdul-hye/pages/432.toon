quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,32,"And those who were arrogant will say to those who were deemed weak: “Did we keep you back from guidance after when it had come to you? Nay, but you yourself were sinners.”"
  34,33,"Those who were deemed weak will say to those who were arrogant: “Nay, but it was you who plotted night and day, when you ordered us to disbelieve in Allah and set up rivals to Him!” They will conceal their own regret (for disobeying Allah in this world) when they will see the punishment. And We shall put iron collars round the necks of those who disbelieved. Are they rewarded exactly for what they did"
  34,34,"And whenever We have sent a Warner to a town, its wealthy people said: “Surely we don’t believe in (the message) what you are sent with.”"
  34,35,"And they say: “We have more wealth and children (our deities are happy), and we shall not be punished.”"
  34,36,"Say (O Muhammad): “Surely, my Lord enlarges and restricts the provision to whom He wills, but most people don’t know.”"
  34,37,"It is neither your wealth, nor your children that bring you nearer to Us. But those who believe, and do righteous deeds; for such, they will have double reward for what they did, and they will reside in the high residences (Paradise) in peace and security"
  34,38,"And those who strive against Our Verses to frustrate them, the punishment will be brought to them"
  34,39,"Say: “Truly, my Lord enlarges the provision for whom He wills of His servants, and also restricts it for some. Whatever you spend of anything (for Allah), He will replace it. And He is the best of providers.”"
