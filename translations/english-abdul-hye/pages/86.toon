quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,45,"Allah knows well your enemies. Sufficient is Allah as a Protector, and sufficient is Allah as a Helper"
  4,46,"Among those who are Jews (some of them) change words from their right places and they say: “We hear and we disobey,” and “Hear us and (let you O Muhammad) hear nothing.” And ‘Raina’ (an evil word used in Arabic in those days) with a twist of their tongues and a mockery of the religion (Islam). If they had only said: “We hear and we obey”, and “Hear us and look at us (to make us understand),” it would have been better for them, and more proper. But Allah has cursed them due to their disbelief, so they don’t believe except a few"
  4,47,"O you who have been given the Scripture! Believe in what We have revealed (to Muhammad) confirming what is (already) with you, before We wipe out your faces and turns them to their backs, or curse them as We cursed the people of Sabbath-breakers. The Commandment of Allah is executed"
  4,48,"Surely, Allah does not forgive that a partner is ascribed to Him, and He forgives other than that to whom He wills. Whoever associates anyone with Allah, indeed has devised a tremendous sin"
  4,49,"Have you not seen those who claim purity (though they believe in sharing partners with Allah) for themselves? Although it is Allah who purifies whom He pleases, and they will not be wronged the least even equal to the thread of a date-stone"
  4,50,"See how they invent a lie against Allah, and it is enough to be a clear sin"
  4,51,Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the book? They believe in baseless superstitions and false deities (forces of Satan) and they say to those who disbelieved that they are better guided than those who believed to the Right Way
