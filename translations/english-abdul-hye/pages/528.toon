quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,"that it is He Who created in pairs, the male and the female"
  53,46,from a drop of semen when it is emitted
  53,47,that it is upon Him to grant another life (Resurrection)
  53,48,that it is He Who gives much or little (of wealth and contentment)
  53,49,that it is He the Lord of Sirius (the star whom the pagan Arabs used to worship)
  53,50,and that it is He Who destroyed the former Ad (people)
  53,51,and Thamud (people). So He spared none
  53,52,"and the people of Noah previously, surely they were more unjust and more rebellious and transgressing"
  53,53,And He destroyed the overthrown cities (of Sodom and Gomorrah during prophet Lot)
  53,54,who were covered by (the punishment with stones) that covered them.”
  53,55,Then which of the graces of your Lord will you doubt
  53,56,This (Muhammad) is a Warner just like the old warners
  53,57,The Day of Resurrection is drawing near
  53,58,none besides Allah can avert it
  53,59,Do you then wonder at this recital (the Qur’an)
  53,60,and laugh at it and don’t weep
  53,61,You are wasting your precious life in pastime and amusements
  53,62,So you fall down in prostration to Allah and worship Him
  54,1,"The Hour (of doom) is drawing near, and the moon has split asunder (the people of Makkah requested Muhammad to show a miracle, so he showed them the splitting of the moon)"
  54,2,"Yet, when they (disbelievers) see a sign, they turn away and say: “This is continuous magic.”"
  54,3,"They deny (the Verses of this Qur’an) and follow their own lusts. Every matter will be settled (good deeds will take to Paradise, and evil deeds will take to hell)"
  54,4,And indeed there has come to them the news (in this Qur’an about previous nations) wherein there is (enough warning) to check (from evil)
  54,5,"perfect wisdom (as a warning), but (preaching of) warners don’t benefit them"
  54,6,So you (O Muhammad) withdraw from them. The Day when the caller will call them to a terrible thing
