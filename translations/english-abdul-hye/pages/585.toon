quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He (the prophet) frowned and turned away
  80,2,"when there came to him the blind man (Abdullah bin Umme Maktoom, who came to the prophet while the prophet was preaching to the chiefs of Makkah)"
  80,3,And how can you know? He might become pure (from sins)
  80,4,"or he might receive admonition, and the admonition might profit him"
  80,5,As for those who think themselves indifferent
  80,6,to whom you were attending
  80,7,"you will not be held responsible, if they would not purify themselves (your duty is to convey the message of Allah)"
  80,8,"Yet, to him who came to you running (with enthusiasm)"
  80,9,and with fear (of Allah)
  80,10,you were unmindful from him
  80,11,"Nay, (you should not do so), indeed this is an admonition"
  80,12,"so those who want, let them pay attention to it"
  80,13,It is written in honored records
  80,14,"exalted (in dignity), purified"
  80,15,in the hands of scribes (angels)
  80,16,(who are) honorable and obedient
  80,17,Be cursed (disbelieving) people! How ungrateful they are
  80,18,Out of what He has created them
  80,19,From semen drop He has created them and then set them in due proportion
  80,20,then makes their way (of life) easy for them
  80,21,then causes them to die and puts them in their graves
  80,22,"Then, He will surely resurrect them again when He wills"
  80,23,"Nay, but they (disbelievers) have not fulfilled what He has commanded them"
  80,24,Then let people look at their food
  80,25,We pour out water (rain) in abundance
  80,26,then split the earth (soil) in clefts
  80,27,And We cause to grow in it the grain
  80,28,and grapes and clover plants
  80,29,and olives and date-palms
  80,30,"and gardens, dense with many trees"
  80,31,and fruits and fodder
  80,32,as a provision and benefit for you and your cattle
  80,33,Then when there will come the deafening shout
  80,34,on that Day a person will flee from his brother
  80,35,and his mother and his father
  80,36,and his spouse and its children
  80,37,"On that Day, every person will have enough concern to become careless of others"
  80,38,Some faces on that Day will be bright (for true believers)
  80,39,"laughing, rejoicing at good news (of Paradise)"
  80,40,And other faces on that Day will be dusty
  80,41,darkness will cover them
  80,42,Such will be the (faces of the) disbelieving wicked
