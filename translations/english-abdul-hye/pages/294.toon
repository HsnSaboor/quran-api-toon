quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  18,5,"They don’t have knowledge about it, nor did their forefathers. Mighty is the word that comes out of their mouths. They say nothing but a lie"
  18,6,"Perhaps, you would kill yourself (O Muhammad) in grief over their footsteps, because they don’t believe in this narration (the Qur’an)"
  18,7,Surely! We have made the earth with all kinds of adornments in order that We may test them (mankind) and to see which of them are best in deeds
  18,8,And surely We shall reduce what is on it (the earth) to a bare dry soil
  18,9,Do you think that the people of the cave and the inscription (news or name writing of the people of the cave) were a wonder among Our Signs
  18,10,"(Remember) when the young men fled (for refuge from their disbelieving folk) to the cave, they said: “Our Lord! Bestow on us Mercy from You and facilitate for us in our affair to the Right Way!”"
  18,11,Therefore We covered on their ears (causing them into deep sleep) in the cave for a number of years
  18,12,then We raised them up (from sleep) so that We might test which of the 2 parties (believers and disbelievers) was best at calculating the time period for which they had stayed
  18,13,We narrate to you (O Muhammad) their story with truth. Surely they were young men who believed in their Lord and We increased them in guidance
  18,14,"And We made their hearts firm and strong when they stood up and said: “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, we shall never call upon any deity other than Him; for if we do, then we shall utter something improper (in disbelief)"
  18,15,These are our people who have taken for deities other than Him (Allah). Why do they not bring for them a clear authority? And who does more wrong than the one who invents a lie against Allah?”
