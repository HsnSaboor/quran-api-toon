quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,25,"And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds, for them there will be gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise). Whenever they will be provided with fruit from there, they will say: “This is what we were provided with before,\" and they will be given from there things having resemblance (of earth); and for them therein will be chaste spouses, and they will live therein forever"
  2,26,"Surely, Allah is not reluctant to set forth an example even of a mosquito or even something more (insignificant) than it. As for those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord; but as for those who disbelieve, they say: “What does Allah mean by this example?” By it He misleads many and guides many. He misleads only the disobedient ones"
  2,27,"those who break the Covenant of Allah after its approval, sever what Allah has ordered to be joined, and do mischief on earth. It is they, who are the losers"
  2,28,"How can you disbelieve in Allah? While you were lifeless and He gave you life. Then He will give you death, then again will bring you to life (on the Day of Resurrection), and then you will return to Him"
  2,29,"It is He, Who has created for you all that is on earth. Then He rose over towards the heaven and made them 7 heavens and He is the All- Knower of everything"
