quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  66,1,"O Prophet! Why do you make unlawful (for yourself) which Allah has made lawful to you in seeking the pleasure of your wives? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  66,2,"Allah has already ordained for you (Muslims) the absolution from your oaths. And Allah is your Master and He is the All-Knower, the All-Wise"
  66,3,"And (remember) when the prophet (Muhammad) disclosed a matter (secret) to one of his wives (Hafsa), she disclosed it (to Aisha). And Allah made it known to him; he informed part of it (to Aisha) and left a part. Then when he told her (Hafsa) of it, she said: “Who told you this?” He said: “The All-Knower, the All-Aware (Allah) has told me.”"
  66,4,"If you both (Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Allah (it will be better) as your hearts have indeed so inclined (to oppose what the prophet likes); but if you help one another against him (Muhammad), then surely (know that) Allah is his Protector, Gabriel, and the righteous (among) the believers, and furthermore, the angels too are his helpers"
  66,5,"It may well be that, if he divorces you all, his Lord will give him wives better than you in exchange: Muslims, believers, obedient (to Allah), turn to Allah in repentance, worshippers, (who are) fasting or emigrating (for Allah’s sake), previously married and virgins"
  66,6,"O you who believe! Save yourselves and your families against a fire (hell) whose fuel is people and stones, over which angels are appointed who are stern and severe, who don’t disobey the Commandments they receive from Allah, but do what they are commanded"
  66,7,"(It will be said in the Hereafter): “O you who disbelieve! Don’t make excuses this Day! You are being requited only for what you used to do.”"
