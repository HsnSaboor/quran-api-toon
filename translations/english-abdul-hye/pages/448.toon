quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"who used to say: ‘Are you among those who believe (in Resurrection after death)"
  37,53,"When we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed (be raised up) to receive reward or punishment (according to deeds)?”’"
  37,54,"It will be said (to him): “Will you look down (to see the friend)?”"
  37,55,So the person looked down and saw friend in the midst of the fire
  37,56,"The person said: “By Allah! You have nearly ruined me"
  37,57,"Had it not been for the Grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought forth (to hell)"
  37,58,"(The believer in the heaven will say): “Are we then not to die (any more)"
  37,59,after our first death and we shall not be punished?”
  37,60,"Truly, this is the supreme success"
  37,61,"For such an end, let everyone strive who wishes to strive"
  37,62,Is this (Paradise) a better entertainment or the tree of the Zaqqum (a horrible tree in hell)
  37,63,"Truly, We have made it a trail for the wrongdoers"
  37,64,"Surely, it is a tree that grows in the bottom of hellfire"
  37,65,the shoots of its fruit-stalks are like the heads of devils
  37,66,"so truly, they will eat from it and fill their bellies from it"
  37,67,"Then surely, on top of that, they will be given a mixture of boiling water (to drink)"
  37,68,"Then surely, their return is to the flaming fire of hell"
  37,69,"In fact, they found their fathers on the wrong way"
  37,70,so they are too haste to follow their footsteps
  37,71,and indeed most of the ancient people went astray before them
  37,72,and indeed We had sent warners (Messengers) among them
  37,73,Then see how was the end of those who were warned (all perished)
  37,74,except the chosen (faithful) devotees of Allah
  37,75,"And indeed Noah prayed to Us, and indeed We are the Best to answer (the prayer)"
  37,76,And We rescued him and his family from the great distress (drowning)
