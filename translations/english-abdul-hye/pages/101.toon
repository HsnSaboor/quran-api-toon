quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"Those (hypocrites) are watching closely to you. If there is a victory for you from Allah, they say: “Were we not with you?” But if there is a chance (of success) for disbelievers, they say: “Did we not have mastery over you and did we not protect you from the believers (Muslims)?” Allah will judge between you and them on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah will never make for the disbelievers over the believers a way (to triumph)"
  4,142,"Surely, the hypocrites (try to) deceive Allah, but it is He Who deceives them. And when they stand up to the prayer, they stand with laziness to be seen by the people, and they don’t remember Allah but little"
  4,143,"(they are) swaying between this and that, neither to these nor to those. Whom Allah sends astray, you can never find for them a way (to Islam)"
  4,144,O you who believe! You don’t take the disbelievers as allies instead of believers. Do you wish that you give Allah against yourselves a clear proof
  4,145,"Surely, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the fire; and you will not find for them any helper"
  4,146,"Except those who repent (from hypocrisy), mend their ways, hold fast to Allah, and purify their religion for Allah, they will be with the believers. And Allah will grant to the believers a great reward"
  4,147,"Why should Allah punish you if you have thanked (Him) and you have believed (in Him)? Allah is All-Appreciative (of good), All-Knower"
