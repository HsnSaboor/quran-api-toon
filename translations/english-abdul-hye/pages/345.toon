quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,43,no nation can precede their term nor can they delay it
  23,44,"then We sent Our Messengers in succession, whenever their Messenger came to a nation, they denied him, so We made some of them follow others (to destruction), and We made them as true stories (for mankind). So gone is the people who don’t believe"
  23,45,Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our Verses and clear authority
  23,46,"to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they behaved arrogantly and they were self-exalting people"
  23,47,"Then they said: “Shall we believe in 2 human beings like ourselves and whose people are our captives?”"
  23,48,So they denied them (Moses and Aaron) and became of those who were destroyed
  23,49,"And indeed We gave Moses the Scripture, so that they may be guided"
  23,50,"And We made the son of Mary (Jesus) and his mother as a sign, and We gave them refuge to a high ground, a place of rest, and flowing streams"
  23,51,O Messengers! Eat of lawful foods and do righteous deeds. Surely! I am Well-Acquainted with what you do
  23,52,"And surely! This religion is one religion, and I am your Lord, so fear Me"
  23,53,"But they have broken their religion among them into sects, each group rejoices in what is with them"
  23,54,So leave them in their error for a time
  23,55,Do they think what We give them with wealth and children
  23,56,We hasten to them with good things? But they don’t perceive
  23,57,Surely! Those who live in awe for fear of their Lord
  23,58,and those who believe in the Verses of their Lord
  23,59,and those who don’t join anyone in worship (as partners) with their Lord
