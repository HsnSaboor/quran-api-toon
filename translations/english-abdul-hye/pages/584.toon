quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,When his Lord called him in the sacred valley of Tuwa
  79,17,"and said: “Go to Pharaoh, surely he has transgressed all bounds"
  79,18,"and say to him: ‘Do you have the desire to purify yourself (from sins)"
  79,19,"I will guide you to your Lord, so that you may fear (Him).’”"
  79,20,Then he (Moses) showed him (Pharaoh) the great sign (miracles)
  79,21,but he (Pharaoh) denied and disobeyed
  79,22,Then he turned his back and strive (against Allah)
  79,23,gathered his people and cried aloud
  79,24,"saying: “I am your Lord, most high.”"
  79,25,So Allah seized him with punishment for the Hereafter and this life
  79,26,"Surely, in this, there is an admonition for those who fear (Allah)"
  79,27,Are you (O mankind) more difficult to create or the heaven that He constructed
  79,28,He raised its canopy and perfected it
  79,29,He covers its night with darkness and brings out light in its forenoon
  79,30,"And after that, He spreads out the earth"
  79,31,and brings out its water and its pasture from there
  79,32,fixed the mountains firmly
  79,33,made a provision and benefit for you and for your cattle
  79,34,But when the greatest catastrophe (the Day of recompense) will strike
  79,35,the Day when people will remember what they had striven for
  79,36,When hellfire shall be made apparent in full view for those who see
  79,37,"then, those who transgressed all bounds (evil deeds)"
  79,38,and preferred the worldly life
  79,39,"surely, will have their abode in hell"
  79,40,But those who feared standing before their Lord and restrained themselves from evil desires
  79,41,"then surely, will have their homes in Paradise"
  79,42,"They ask you (O Muhammad) about the Hour: “When will be its appointed time?”"
  79,43,But you have no knowledge to say anything about it
  79,44,Only your Lord (has knowledge of) the term of it
  79,45,You (O Muhammad) are only a Warner for those who fear it
  79,46,"On that Day, when they will see it, it will be as if they had not stayed (in this world) only an afternoon or one morning"
