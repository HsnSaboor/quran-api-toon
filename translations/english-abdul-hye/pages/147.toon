  6,145,"Say (O Muhammad): “I don’t find in what has been revealed to me anything prohibited to be eaten by one who intends to eat it, except that it be dead animal or blood poured out, or flesh of pork: for that is surely unclean or impious (unlawful meat slaughtered) by invoking name of other than Allah.

  6,146,"And to those who are Jews, We forbade every animal with claws (undivided hoof), and We prohibited them the fat of the cows and the sheep, except what is carried to their backs or intestines, or what is mixed with bone. Thus We punished them for their rebellion. Surely, We are Truthful"
