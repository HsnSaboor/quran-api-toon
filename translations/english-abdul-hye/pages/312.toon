  19,96,"Surely, those who believe and do righteous deeds, the Gracious (Allah) will bestow love for them"
  19,97,So We have only made this (the Qur’an) easy on your tongue (O Muhammad) so that you may give glad tidings to the pious with it and warn with it the most quarrelsome people
  19,98,And how many generations before them We have destroyed? Can you (O Muhammad) find anyone from them or hear even a whisper of them
  20,1,Ta-Ha
  20,2,We have not sent down the Qur’an to you (O Muhammad) to cause you distress
  20,3,but only as a reminder to those who fear (Allah)

  20,5,the Gracious (Allah) rose over the Throne (to suit Majesty)
  20,6,"to Him belongs all that is in the heavens, all that is on the earth, all that is between them, and all that is under the soil"
  20,7,"And if you (O Muhammad) speak (statement) aloud, then surely He knows the secrets and what is hidden"
