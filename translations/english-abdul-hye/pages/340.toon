quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,65,"Don’t you see that Allah has subjected to you (people) what is on the earth, and the ships that sail through the sea by His Command? He withholds the heaven lest it fall on the earth except by His permission. Surely, Allah is full of Kindness, Merciful for mankind"
  22,66,"It is He, Who has given you life, then will cause you to die, and then will again give you life (on the Day of Resurrection). Surely! People are ungrateful"
  22,67,"For every nation We have ordained religious ceremonies that they follow; so let them (the Pagans) not dispute with you in this matter, and invite them to your Lord. Surely! You (O Muhammad) indeed are on right guidance"
  22,68,"If they argue with you, then say: “Allah knows best of what you do.”"
  22,69,Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection about which you used to differ
  22,70,"Don’t you know that Allah knows what is in heaven and the earth? Surely, all are (recorded) in a book. Surely! That is easy for Allah"
  22,71,"And yet, they worship besides Allah what He has not sent down with any authority, they have no knowledge about them, and there is no helper for the wrongdoers"
  22,72,"And when Our clear Verses are recited to them, you will notice denial on the faces of those who disbelieve! They are nearly ready to attack with violence those who recite Our Verses to them. Say: “Shall I tell you something worse than that? It is the fire (of hell) which Allah has promised to those who disbelieve, and worst indeed will be that destination!”"
