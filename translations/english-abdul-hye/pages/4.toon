quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"Their example is like the one who kindled a fire; then when it lighted all around him, Allah took away their light (eyesight) and left them in darkness, so they could not see"
  2,18,"(They are) deaf, dumb, and blind, so they will not return (to Right Way)"
  2,19,"Or like a rainstorm from the sky with darkness, thunder, and lightning. They press their fingers in their ears from (the sound of) thunderclaps for fear of death. But Allah surrounds the disbelievers"
  2,20,"The lightning almost snatches away their sight; whenever it flashes for them, they walk in it; and when it darkens against them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Certainly, Allah has power over all things"
  2,21,"O mankind! Worship your Lord, Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become pious"
  2,22,"It is He Who has made for you the earth a resting place, the sky as a canopy, sends down rain from the sky, and brings out with it fruits as a provision for you. So don’t set up rivals to Allah (in worship) while you know"
  2,23,"And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down (the Qur’an) to Our servant (Muhammad), then produce a chapter like this, and call your witnesses besides Allah, if you are truthful"
  2,24,"But if you can not do it, and you are not able do it, then fear the hellfire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers"
