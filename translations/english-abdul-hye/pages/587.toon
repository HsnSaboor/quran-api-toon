  82,1,When the heaven will cleft asunder
  82,2,and when the stars will scatter
  82,3,and when the oceans are burst out
  82,4,and when the graves will be turned upside down (bring out their contents)
  82,5,every person will know what he has sent forward and what left behind
  82,6,"O people! What has made you careless about your Lord, the Generous"
  82,7,"who created you, fashioned you perfectly, gave you due proportion"
  82,8,and put you together in whatever form He willed
  82,9,Nay! But you deny the Day of Judgment
  82,10,"But surely, (angels have been appointed to watch) over you"
  82,11,(who are) honorable writers
  82,12,they know all of what you do
  82,13,"Surely, (on that Day) the righteous will be in delight (Paradise)"

  83,1,Woe to those who give less in measure and weight (defraud)
  83,2,"those who, when they receive by measure from people, demand full measure"
  83,3,"but when they give by measure or give by weight to others, they give less than due"
  83,4,Don’t they think that they will be resurrected
