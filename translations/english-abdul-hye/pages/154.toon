quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  7,31,"O children of Adam! Take your adornment (wear clean clothes) at every Masjid (for prayer). Eat and drink, but don’t waste by extravagance; indeed He does not like the wasters"
  7,32,"Say (O Muhammad): “Who has forbidden the adornment (to wear decent clothes) given by Allah, which He has produced for His servants, and good things of the sustenance (lawful food)?” Say: “These are for those who believe in the life of this world, but these shall be exclusively for them on Day of Resurrection.” Thus We explain the Verses for people who understand"
  7,33,"Say (O Muhammad): “Indeed my Lord has forbidden shameful deeds which were committed openly, of them which were committed secretly, sins and transgression without the right, associate others with Allah what He has not sent with any authority, and say about Allah of which you do no know"
  7,34,"For every nation there is a fixed term; when their term is reached, neither can they delay for a moment nor they can bring it earlier.”"
  7,35,"O children of Adam! If Messengers come to you from among you, recite to you My Verses, then those who fear (Allah) and mend themselves, there will not be any fear upon them, and they will not grieve"
  7,36,"but those who reject Our Verses, and treat them with arrogance, those are the inmates of the fire; they will abide in it forever"
  7,37,"Who is more unjust than the one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Verses? They are those whose share will reach them from the book (of decrees) until when Our Messengers (angels of death) come to them causing them to die, they (angels) will say: “Where are those whom you used to invoke other than Allah?” They will reply: “They have forsaken us.” They will testify against themselves that indeed they were disbelievers"
