quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  4,66,"And if We had enjoined upon them (saying): “You kill yourselves (the innocent ones kill the guilty ones) or leave from your homes,” they would not have done it except very few of them. If they had done what they were commanded of it, it would have been better for them, and would have added (to their faith) firmness"
  4,67,and then We would have given them a great reward from Ourselves
  4,68,and We would have guided them to the Right Way
  4,69,"And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad), they will be with those upon whom Allah has bestowed (Allah’s) blessings - the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous. How excellent these companions will be"
  4,70,"That is the Bounty from Allah, and Allah is sufficient as All-Knower"
  4,71,"O you who believe! You take your precautions, and advance in groups or advance all together"
  4,72,"Indeed among you is one who lags behind (from fighting in Allah’s cause). Then if a calamity befalls you, he says: “Indeed Allah has bestowed (Allah’s) blessings upon me that I was not present with them.”"
  4,73,"But if a Bounty from Allah befalls you, he would say as if there had not been affection between you and him: “(I wish) I had been with them; then I would have achieved a great success.”"
  4,74,Let those (believers) who fight in the way of Allah only be (those) who sell life of this world in exchange of the Hereafter. Whoever fights in the way of Allah and is killed or gets victory; We shall grant a great reward
