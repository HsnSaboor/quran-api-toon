  16,80,"And Allah has made for you in your homes an abode, and made for you out of the hides of the cattle (as tent for) homes which you find light during the day of your travel and during the day of your stay (in travel); and from their wool, fur, and hair, (Allah provides) furniture, articles of convenience (such as carpets, blankets), comfort for a while"
  16,81,"And Allah has made shades (from sun) for you out of that which He has created. He has made for you places of refuge in the mountains, has made for you garments to protect you from the heat, and coats of armor to protect you from your mutual violence. Thus He perfects His Grace to you so that you may submit (to Islam)"
