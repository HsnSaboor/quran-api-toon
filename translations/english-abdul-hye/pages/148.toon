quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,147,"If they deny you (Muhammad) say: “Your Lord is owner of vast Mercy, but His punishment can not be averted from the guilty people.”"
  6,148,"Those who made partners with Allah will say: “If Allah had willed, we would have made neither partner with Him, nor would our forefathers, nor we would have prohibited anything (against Him).” Likewise those who were before them rejected until they tasted Our punishment. Say: “Is there any knowledge (evidence) with you which you can provide to us? You follow nothing but guess and you are not but guessing.”"
  6,149,"Say: “Allah has conclusive argument, and had He willed, He would have guided you all.”"
  6,150,"Say: “Bring your witnesses, who can testify that Allah has prohibited this.” Even if they testify, you (O Muhammad) don’t testify with them. You don’t follow desires of those who have rejected Our Verses, those who don’t believe in the Hereafter, and they set up others as equals with their Lord"
  6,151,"Say (O Muhammad): “Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you that you don’t associate anything with Him, do good with parents, don’t kill your children (for fear) of poverty - We provide sustenance for you and for them; don’t draw near those shameful deeds that are committed openly or secretly, don’t kill a life which Allah has forbidden, except in a just cause. He has commanded you these so that you may understand"
