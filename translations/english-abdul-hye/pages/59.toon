quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,71,O people of the Scripture! Why do you mix truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know
  3,72,"A party of people of the Scripture says: “Believe in what is sent down on those who believe (Muslims) in early part of the day, and reject it at the end of the day, so that they (Muslims) may turn back (abandon truth)"
  3,73,"And you don’t believe anyone but the one who follows your religion.” Say (O Muhammad): “Surely! The true Guidance is the Guidance of Allah.” (These people of the book don’t believe) that someone (besides them) could be given revelation like what you have been given, or they will argue with you before your Lord. Say (O Muhammad): “Surely! All the Bounty is in the Hand of Allah; Allah gives it to whom He wills. And Allah is Generous, All-knower.”"
  3,74,He selects Mercy for whom He wills and Allah is the Owner of Great Bounty
  3,75,"Among the people of the Scripture (there are some) who, if you entrust them with a heap of wealth, will pay it back to you; and among them there are others who, if you entrust them with a single silver coin, will not pay it back to you unless you keep on demanding, because they say: “There is no blame on us (to betray and take the properties of) the unlettered people (who are not Jews or Christians).” But they tell a lie against Allah while they know it"
  3,76,"Yes, those who fulfill their promise and fear Allah much; surely Allah loves those who are pious"
  3,77,"Surely, those who sell the covenants of Allah and their oaths for a small price (gain); they shall have no share in the Hereafter. Neither Allah will speak to them, nor look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor He will purify them, and they shall have a painful punishment"
