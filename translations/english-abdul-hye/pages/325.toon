quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  21,36,"And when you (Muhammad) see those who disbelieve, they don’t take you except for mockery (saying): “Is this the one who talks against your deity?” They disbelieve at the mention of the Gracious (Allah)"
  21,37,"Man is a creature of haste (impatient). I will show you My Signs, so don’t ask Me to hasten"
  21,38,"And they ask: “When will this promise (be fulfilled) if you are truthful?”"
  21,39,"(They would not ask) if the disbelievers knew the time when they will neither be able to protect their faces from the fire nor their backs, and they will not be helped"
  21,40,"Nay, it (the fire) will come to them all of a sudden and will perplex them, so they will neither be able to avert it nor they will get any respite"
  21,41,"Indeed Messengers were mocked before you (O Muhammad), but those who mocked were surrounded by what they used to mock at"
  21,42,"Say: “Who can protect you in the night and the day from the (punishment of) the Gracious?” Nay, but they turn away from the remembrance of their Lord"
  21,43,"Or do they have (ones worthy of worship) who can guard them from Us? They have neither any power to help themselves, nor can they be protected from Us (punishment)"
  21,44,"Nay, We gave luxuries (of this life to) these people and their forefathers until the life grew long for them. Don’t they then see how We (gradually) reduce the land (their control) from its all sides? Is it then they who will overcome (be victorious)"
