quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,107,"And as for those who built a Masjid (Masjid-e-Zirar) by way of harming, disbelief, to disunite between the believers, and as an outpost for those who made war against Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad) before, they will indeed swear that they want nothing but good. Allah bears witness that they are certainly liars"
  9,108,"You should never stand (to offer prayer) in it. Surely, the Masjid whose foundation was laid from the first day on piety is more deserving that you stand (to pray) in it. In it are people who love to clean and to purify themselves. Allah loves those who make themselves clean and pure"
  9,109,"Who is a better one; the one who lays the foundation of a building on piety from Allah and His good pleasure, or the one who lays the foundation of a building on a cliff edge ready to crumble down, so that it will crumble to pieces with him into the fire of hell? And Allah does not guide the people who are the wrongdoers"
  9,110,"Their building which they built will not cease to be a cause of doubt in their hearts unless their hearts are cut to pieces. Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise"
  9,111,"Surely, Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties; for (the price) that theirs shall be the Paradise. They fight in Allah’s Way, so they kill others and are killed. It is a true promise which is binding on Him mentioned in the Torah, the Gospel, and the Qur’an. Who is truer to (fulfill) its covenant than Allah? Then rejoice in your bargain which you have made with it. That is the supreme success"
