quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,"Nay, (O people) you prefer the worldly life"
  87,17,although the Hereafter is better and everlasting
  87,18,Surely! This is in the former Scriptures
  87,19,the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Has the news of the overwhelming event (of Resurrection) reached you
  88,2,On that Day some faces will be humiliated (in the hellfire)
  88,3,"in hard labor, worn out"
  88,4,burn in the hot blazing fire
  88,5,given to drink from a boiling spring
  88,6,They will have no food except bitter thorny fruit
  88,7,that will neither nourish nor satisfy hunger
  88,8,Other faces on that Day will be joyful
  88,9,pleased with their endeavors (of good deeds)
  88,10,in a high garden (Paradise)
  88,11,They will hear no vain talk in it
  88,12,They will have a running spring in it
  88,13,They will be on thrones raised high in it
  88,14,with cups placed at hand
  88,15,and cushions set in rows
  88,16,and rich carpets spread out
  88,17,"Don’t they look at the camels, how they are created"
  88,18,"And the sky, how it is raised"
  88,19,"And the mountains, how they are fixed firmly"
  88,20,"And the earth, how it is spread out"
  88,21,"So remind them (O Muhammad), you are only a reminder"
  88,22,not a dictator over them
  88,23,Except those who turn away and disbelieve
  88,24,then Allah will punish them with the greatest punishment
  88,25,"Surely, to Us will be their return"
  88,26,"then surely, We will take their reckoning"
