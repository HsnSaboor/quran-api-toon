quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  20,99,Thus We relate to you (O Muhammad) from information of what happened before. Indeed We have given you a reminder (this Qur’an) from Us
  20,100,"Whoever turns away from it (this Qur’an), then surely will bear a burden (of sins) on the Day of Resurrection"
  20,101,They will abide in that (fire of hell) and evil will be that load for them on the Day of Resurrection
  20,102,"The Day, when the trumpet will be blown and We shall gather the sinners that Day (they will be) blue or blind eyed (by fear)"
  20,103,"They will whisper among themselves (saying): “You did not stay longer than 10 (days on earth).”"
  20,104,"We know very well what they will say, the best among them in knowledge and wisdom will say: “You did not stay except a day!”"
  20,105,"And they ask you about the mountains. You say: “My Lord will blast them as particles of dust"
  20,106,Then He will leave it as a smooth level
  20,107,you will neither see in it crookedness nor curve.”
  20,108,"On that Day the people will follow the caller (of Allah); there is no crookedness for the caller. (All voices) will be humbled for the Gracious (Allah), so you shall hear nothing but a whisper (of footsteps)"
  20,109,"On that Day no intercession will be available, except the one to whom the Gracious (Allah) will give permission and whose word is acceptable to Him"
  20,110,"He (Allah) knows what is before them, what is behind them, and they will never compass any knowledge (about Him)"
  20,111,"And faces shall be humbled before the ever-Living, the self-Sustaining (Allah). Indeed the one who carried a burden of wrong-doing will be disappointed"
  20,112,"And one who is a believer and does righteous deeds, then he will neither have fear of injustice, nor reduction (of reward)"
  20,113,"And thus We have sent down the Qur’an in Arabic, has explained in it the details of the warnings so that they may fear Allah, or may generate lesson from it"
