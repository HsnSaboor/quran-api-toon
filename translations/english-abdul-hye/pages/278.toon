quran[9]{c,v,t}:

  16,95,And don’t purchase a small gain (at the cost of) Allah’s Covenant. Surely! What is with Allah is better for you if you but knew it

  16,102,"Say (O Muhammad): “The Holy Spirit (angel Gabriel) has brought it (the Qur’an) down from your Lord with truth to strengthen those who believe, and as guidance, and glad tidings to the Muslims.”"
