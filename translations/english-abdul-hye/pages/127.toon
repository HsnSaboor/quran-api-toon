quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,114,"Jesus, son of Mary, said: “O Allah, our Lord! Send down upon us a table from the heaven which will be a festival for us - for first and the last of us and a sign from You; and provide us sustenance, and You are best of sustainers.”"
  5,115,"Allah said: “Surely I will send it down to you, but whoever disbelieves after that among you, then I will punish with a punishment such that I have not punished (like that) anyone of the worlds.”"
  5,116,"And (remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): “O Jesus, son of Mary! Did you say to people: ‘Take me and my mother as 2 who are worthy of worship besides Allah?”’ Jesus will say: “Glory is to You! It was not for me that I say what I had no right to say. Had I said it, then surely You would have known it. You know what is in my soul and I don’t know what is in Your; truly, You know all of the hidden things"
  5,117,"I did not say to them except what You commanded me of it that (say): ‘You worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. I was over them a witness till I remained among them, but when You recalled me, You were the watcher over them, and You are a witness over everything"
  5,118,"If You punish them, surely they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, surely You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”’"
  5,119,"Allah will say: “This is the Day the truthful will profit their truthfulness: for them are gardens with the rivers flowing under them (in Paradise) - they shall abide in it forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. That is the great success.”"
  5,120,"To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, what is in them, and He has power over everything"
