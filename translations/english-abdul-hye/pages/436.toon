  35,12,"And the 2 seas are not alike - one is fresh sweet and pleasant to drink; and the other is salty and bitter. Yet, from each of them you eat fresh meat (fish) and get ornaments to wear. You see the ships sailing through them, that you may seek His Bounty, and that you may give thanks"
  35,13,"He merges the night into the day and the day into the night. And He has subjected the sun and the moon (to serve you), each runs (its course) for an appointed term.

  35,14,"If you pray to them, they don’t hear your call, and even if they hear you, they can not answer you. On the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. None can inform you (O mankind) like the One Who is the All-Knower"
  35,15,"O mankind! It is you who stands in need of Allah, but Allah is Rich, Praise-Worthy"
  35,16,"If He wills, He can destroy you and replace with a new creation"

  35,18,"And no bearer of burdens shall bear another’s burden, and if one heavily laden calls another to carry it (load), nothing will be lifted from it even though he is a close relative.
