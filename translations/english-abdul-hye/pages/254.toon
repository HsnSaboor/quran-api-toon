quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  13,35,"The likeness of the Paradise which the pious have been promised (is): rivers flow beneath it, its provision is eternal, and so is its shade; this is the end (final destination) of those who are pious and the end (final destination) of the disbelievers is fire"
  13,36,"Those whom We have given the book, rejoice at what has been revealed to you (the Qur’an), but there are those among the clans who reject a part thereof. Say (O Muhammad): “I am commanded only to worship Allah (alone) and not to join partners with Him. To Him alone I call and to Him is my return.”"
  13,37,"And thus We have sent it (the Qur’an) down to be a judgment of authority in Arabic. Were you (O Muhammad) to follow their vain desires after the knowledge has come to you, then you will not have any protector or defender against Allah"
  13,38,"And indeed We have sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad), and have made for them wives and offspring. It was not for a Messenger to bring a sign except by Allah’s permission. For each and every matter there is a Decree (from Allah)"
  13,39,Allah wipes out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the mother (master copy) of the book
  13,40,"Whether We show you (O Muhammad) part of what We have promised them or cause you to die, your duty is only to convey (the message) and on Us is the reckoning"
  13,41,"Don’t they see that We are gradually reducing the land from its outlying borders? And when Allah judges, there is none to put back His judgment and He is Swift at reckoning"
  13,42,"And surely, those (disbelievers) who devised plots were before them, but Allah is planning all. He knows what every one earns. The disbelievers will know for whom will be the good end of the home (of Paradise)"
