quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,191,"And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. (Though killing is bad) creating mischief is worse than killing. Don’t fight them at the sacred Masjid (at Makkah), unless they (first) fight you there. But if they attack you, then kill them. Such is the punishment of the disbelievers"
  2,192,"But if they cease, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  2,193,"And fight them until no oppression exists and worship is for Allah (alone). But if they cease, (there should be) no hostility except against the wrongdoers"
  2,194,"The sacred month is for the prohibited month, and for the prohibited things, (that is) the law of equality (subject to retaliation). Whoever transgresses against you, you transgress likewise. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is with the pious"
  2,195,"And spend in the cause of Allah and don’t throw yourselves into destruction (by not spending for Allah), and do good. Surely, Allah loves the righteous"
  2,196,"And complete the Hajj (obligatory pilgrimage to Makkah) and Umrah (optional visit to Makkah) for Allah. But if you are prevented (from completing them), then send sacrifice whatever you can afford, and don’t shave your head until the offering reaches its appointed place. And whoever among you is sick or has an ailment in the scalp (needs shaving), then he must pay ransom either by fasting (for 3 days) or feeding the poor (6 people) or offering a sacrifice (one sheep). If you are safe (during peacetime) and whoever performs Umrah before the Hajj, then sacrifice whatever you can easily afford, but whoever cannot afford, then fast for 3 days during the pilgrimage and 7 days after return (to home), making 10 days in all. That is for those whose family is not present (non-resident) at the Sacred Masjid. Fear Allah and know that Allah is severe in punishment"
