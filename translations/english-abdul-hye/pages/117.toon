quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,51,"O you who believe! You don’t take the Jews and the Christians as allies, some of them are allies of others. Anyone of you takes them as allies, then he will be counted as one of them. Surely, Allah does not guide the wrongdoers"
  5,52,"And you see those in whose hearts there is a disease (of hypocrisy), they hurry to them, saying: “We fear that a misfortune may befall us.” Perhaps that Allah brings a victory or a decision from His will, then they will become regretful on what they have concealed in themselves"
  5,53,"Those who believe will say: “Are these the ones (hypocrites) who swore by Allah of their strongest oaths that they are with you (Muslims)?” Their deeds have gone to waste (because of hypocrisy), and they have become the losers"
  5,54,"O you who believe! Whoever among you turns back from religion (Islam), Allah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him; humble towards the believers, strict towards the disbelievers, strive in the Way of Allah, and will not fear blame of a critic. That is the Grace of Allah, He grants whom He wills. Allah is All-Sufficient in resources, All-Knower"
  5,55,"Your only friend is Allah, His Messenger, and those who believe - those who establish the prayer, give obligatory charity, and they are those who bow down"
  5,56,"Whoever takes as friends: Allah, His Messenger, and those who have believe, then the party of Allah will be victorious"
  5,57,"O you who believe! You don’t take as allies, those from among the people who were given the Scripture before you and the disbelievers, who have take your religion for mockery and fun. Fear Allah if you are true believers"
