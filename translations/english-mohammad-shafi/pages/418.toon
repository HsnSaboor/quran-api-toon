quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  33,1,"O Prophet! Fear Allah and obey not the disbelievers (suppressors of the Truth) and the hypocrites. Allah is indeed Knowledgeable, Wise"
  33,2,And follow what is revealed to you from your Lord. Allah is indeed ever Aware of what you (all people) do
  33,3,And have trust in Allah! And Allah is sufficient as dispenser of affairs
  33,4,"Allah has not made for any man two hearts within him. And He has not made your wives, whom you desert by Zihar (i.e. by uttering that your wives' backs are like your mothers' backs), your mothers. And He has not made your adopted sons your sons. These are just words uttered by your mouths. And Allah tells the truth and it is He Who shows the way"
  33,5,"Call them by names linking them to their fathers; this is the equitable thing to do by Allah's standards. And if you know not their fathers, then they are your brethren in faith and your wards. And there is no blame on you in that you make a mistake therein without any bad intention. And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful"
  33,6,"The Prophet is closer to the believers than they are to themselves. And his wives are their mothers. And the womb (blood) relations are closer one to another, in Allah's Writ, than to the other believers and the migrants, except for what good you do to your bosom friends. This is as recorded in the Book"
