quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,60,"Have you not seen those who assert that they believe in what has been revealed to you and in what was revealed before you? They would like to go to someone who has rebelled against Allah, for judgement, although they were commanded to deny him. And the Satan desires to lead them far astray"
  4,61,"And when it is said to them, \"Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Messenger\", you see the hypocrites turning away from you in aversion"
  4,62,"Then, how about it, when a calamity befalls them on account of what they did before, and they come to you swearing by Allah, \"We did not desire anything but goodwill and amity"
  4,63,"Allah knows what is there in their inner minds. So leave them alone, admonish them, and speak to them words that would touch their inner souls"
  4,64,"And We did not send any Messenger but to be obeyed by Allah's command. And if only they had — when they were unjust to themselves — come to you and asked forgiveness of Allah and the Messenger asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Accepting repentance, Merciful"
  4,65,"No! By your Lord, no! They believe not, until they make you the arbiter in disputes among them, and then find no reservations in their minds on your decisions and submit to them entirely"
