quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  33,44,"Their salutation on the day they meet Him will be, \"Peace!\" And He has prepared for them a noble reward"
  33,45,"O Prophet! We have indeed sent you as a witness, and to convey good news (to the people) and to warn (them)"
  33,46,"And as one who invites people to Allah with His permission, and as a lighted lamp"
  33,47,And give the believers the good news that they shall have a great favour from Allah
  33,48,"And obey not those who suppress the Truth and obey not the hypocrites, and tolerate the annoyance they cause you, and trust Allah. And Allah is sufficient as dispenser of affairs"
  33,49,"O you who believe! When you marry believing women and then divorce them before you touch them, you have in their case no waiting period which you should observe. However make a good provision for them and set them free in a fair manner"
  33,50,"O Prophet! We have made lawful to you your wives whom you have given their dowries, and those whom your right hand possesses out of those whom Allah has given you as prisoners of war, and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who migrated with you; and a believing woman, if she gives herself to the Prophet, if the Prophet desires to marry her. This is a special provision for you only, not for the (other) believers. We do know what We have ordained for them concerning their wives and concerning those whom their right hands possess. We give this clarification in order that no blame may lie on you. Andh Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful"
