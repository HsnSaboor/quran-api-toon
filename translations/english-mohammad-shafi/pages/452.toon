quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you? How poorly do you judge
  37,155,Would you not yet take heed
  37,156,"Or, do you have any clear authority"
  37,157,"Then produce your document, if what you say is true"
  37,158,And they assume a relationship between Him and the jinn. And the jinn do certainly know that they will be brought up for judgment
  37,159,Allah is far more glorious than how they describe Him
  37,160,Except for those who devotedly worship Allah alone
  37,161,So you indeed and what you worship
  37,162,Are incapable of tempting anyone against Him
  37,163,Save him who is destined to burn in the flaming Fire
  37,164,And there is none of us (Angels) but has an assigned place
  37,165,And we are indeed those ranged in ranks
  37,166,And we do indeed certainly glorify Him
  37,167,And they did indeed use to say
  37,168,If only we had a scripture from the ancestors
  37,169,We would have devotedly worshipped Allah alone
  37,170,"And so they now disbelieve in it (the Qur'aan), and so they will soon come to know"
  37,171,And Our word has certainly already gone forth to those of Our subjects sent as the Messengers
  37,172,That they indeed are surely those who shall be helped
  37,173,"And, indeed, Ours will be the triumphant army"
  37,174,So turn away from them for a while
  37,175,"And observe them, they too will observe"
  37,176,Would they want Our punishment hastened
  37,177,"It will be a bad day for those who wait for the punishment, as it would descend in their yard"
  37,178,And turn away from them for a while
  37,179,"And observe, they too will observe"
  37,180,"Your Lord, the Lord of Majesty, is far more glorified than how they describe Him"
  37,181,And peace on those sent as Messengers
  37,182,"And praise to Allah, the Lord of the worlds"
