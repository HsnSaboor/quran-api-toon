quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and turned away
  80,2,That the blind man came to him
  80,3,"And what do you know? He might reform [to become a righteous man]"
  80,4,"Or, he might deliberate and the deliberation might benefit him"
  80,5,Now he who is well-to-do
  80,6,To him you pay attention
  80,7,"And [even when] it is not your responsibility if he would not reform"
  80,8,And he who comes to you in earnest
  80,9,And fears (Allah)
  80,10,By him then are you distracted
  80,11,"No! [Your resentment at the blind man's intrusion is not right.] This [Qur'aan] is only an open source of divine Admonition to recite"
  80,12,So whoso wills may recite it and take heed from
  80,13,In records honourable
  80,14,Exalted and purified
  80,15,By hands of scribes
  80,16,Noble and virtuous
  80,17,"Man be damned, how ungrateful is he"
  80,18,Out of what thing did He create him
  80,19,HE created him out of fertilized ovum and then moulded him in due proportion
  80,20,And then made the path of life convenient for him
  80,21,And then He caused him to die and consigned him to dust
  80,22,"And then, whenever He wishes, He will raise him back to life"
  80,23,No! Man did certainly not carry out what Allah had asked him to do
  80,24,Let man just look at his food
  80,25,"[To enable man to get his food] We poured water [rain] in showers"
  80,26,"And We pierced the soil, so that it got soaked [with rain water]"
  80,27,Then We caused grain to grow therein
  80,28,And grapevines and vegetables
  80,29,And olive-trees and palm-trees
  80,30,And luxuriant orchards
  80,31,And fruits and fodder
  80,32,As provision for you and your cattle
  80,33,Then as the deafening blast occurs
  80,34,On the Day when every man would flee from his brother
  80,35,And his mother and his father
  80,36,And his spouse and his children
  80,37,On that Day everyone among them will be preoccupied with his own individual concerns
  80,38,Faces that Day would be beaming
  80,39,Cheerful and joyous
  80,40,Faces that Day would be gloomy
  80,41,Darkness covering them
  80,42,"Those would be the ones suppressing the Truth, the ones wicked"
