quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  40,67,"It is He Who created you from dust, then from a tiny seed of fertilized ovum, then from a clinging leech-like clot of blood. He then brings you out as a child, then facilitates you to attain to full strength and then to become old — though some among you die before — so that you reach an appointed term, and so that you understand (sentence continued to next Verse)"
  40,68,"(That) it is He Who gives life and causes death. When He ordains a thing, He just tells it, \"Be\" and it is"
  40,69,"Have you not seen those who dispute Allah's Verses/signs, how they are deviated"
  40,70,Those who deny the Bookand that wherewith We sent Our Messengers. But they will come to know the Truth
  40,71,"When they are dragged by chains, with iron collars around their necks"
  40,72,Through boiling waters. Then they are burned in the Fire
  40,73,"Then they are asked, \"Where are all those whom you worshipped"
  40,74,"(Worshipped) besides Allah?\" They reply, \"They have failed us; but what we used to pray to besides Allah before had no legitimacy to pray to at all!\" Thus does Allah send astray those that suppress the Truth"
  40,75,"(They are told,), \"You are in this sorry plight because you used to exult on earth without right, and because you used to be insolent"
  40,76,"Enter now the gates of Hell, to dwell therein. Evil then is the abode of the arrogant"
  40,77,"Do have patience then! Allah's promise is indeed true. And whether we let you see something of what We promise them, or We cause you to die, still to Us they will be brought back"
