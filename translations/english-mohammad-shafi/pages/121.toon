  5,78,"Cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, son of Mary, were those who suppressed the Truth from among the Children of Israel. That was because they disobeyed and were transgressors"
  5,79,They were not forbidding one another from the forbidden things they did. What they did was certainly bad
  5,80,You see many of them being close to those who suppress the Truth. What their sensual selves have sent ahead for them is certainly so bad that Allah is displeased with them. And in punishment shall they abide
  5,81,"And had they believed in Allah, in the prophet and in what is sent down to him, they would not have taken them for close friends. But most of them are transgressors/profligates"
  5,82,"You will certainly find the Jews and the polytheists to be the bitterest people in hostility towards those who believe. And you will certainly find the nearest in friendship to those who believe, to be those who say, \"We are Christians.\" That is because there are priests and monks among them who do not behave proudly"
