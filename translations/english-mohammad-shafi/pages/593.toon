quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the dawn
  89,2,And the ten nights
  89,3,And the even and the odd
  89,4,And by the night as it passes
  89,5,Is there in this an oath for one with understanding
  89,6,Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with AAad
  89,7,"[The anscient people] of Iram, [city of] lofty-pillared buildings"
  89,8,Like which no city had ever been created on the lands
  89,9,"And [another ancient people of] Thamood who hewed the rocks in the valley [to carve out buildings therefrom]"
  89,10,And Pharaoh of the many tent pegs (i.e. with means and power)
  89,11,Who committed transgression in the lands
  89,12,They often spread anarchy in them
  89,13,Then their Lord lashed them with whip of punishment
  89,14,"Indeed, your Lord is ever watchful"
  89,15,"Then as his Lord tests him by bestowing honour and bounties upon him, man says, \"My Lord has honoured me"
  89,16,"And as He tests him by restricting his provision, he says, \"My Lord has humiliated me"
  89,17,"No! On the contrary, you do not treat the orphan honourably"
  89,18,And urge not one another to feed the poor
  89,19,And devour the inheritance — devouring it all
  89,20,And love the worldly wealth — loving it immensely
  89,21,"[And] no, [the Lord does not restrict His provisions to man to humiliate him]! When the earth is pounded to make it level"
  89,22,And when your Lord reveals Himself with rows upon rows of angels
  89,23,"And Hell brought near, that Day will man remember [what the Qur'aan had told him]! Of what avail will that remembering be to him"
