  57,12,"The Day, you see the believers, men and women, their light streaming out before them and on their right, \"Glad tidings for you today! Gardens with rivers flowing through them. You shall dwell therein forever. That is the highest success"
  57,13,"The Day, the hypocrites, men and women, say to those that had believed, \"Wait for us, so we may have advantage of your light.\" They are told, \"Turn back and look for light elsewhere.\" A wall then rises between them with a gate, on the inside of which is grace and mercy, and against the outside, punishment"
  57,14,"The hypocrites call out to the believers, \"Were we not on your side?\" The believers reply, \"Yes, but you gave in to temptation, you wavered and doubted and you were deceived by your wishful thinking until Allah's will was done; and then the Deceiver [Satan] misled you about Allah"
  57,15,"So this Day no ransom can be accepted from you nor from those who suppressed the truth. Your home is the Fire; that is your companion, and it is a bad journey's end"
  57,16,"Has the time not come for those who believe that their minds should becaome humble in the remembrance of Allah and should submit to what is sent down [from Him] of the Truth, and that they should not become like those who were given the Book before them, whose minds with the passage of time became hardened and many of whom were depraved"
  57,17,"Know that Allah brings the earth back to life after its death. We have verily made Our Verses/signs clear to you, so that you may understand"
  57,18,"Indeed, the truthful men and the truthful women, who give a good loan to Allah, shall have it [the loan] doubled for them, and they shall have a rich reward"
