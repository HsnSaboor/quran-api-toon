quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  33,16,"Say, \"Fleeing will profit you not, if you flee from death, natural or violent. And even then, (when, with Allah's will, you are given respite from death for the time being,) you will not be allowed to enjoy life on this earth but a little"
  33,17,"Say, \"Who is it that can shield you from Allah, if He intends to harm you or He intends to show you mercy?\" And they will find none as a wali to them or to help them besides Allah"
  33,18,"Allah does know those among you who hinder others and those who say to their brethren, \"Come to us!\" And they hardly come to fight in a battle"
  33,19,"They grudge any help to you. But when fear grips them, you will see them look at you with eyes rolling, as if death has overtaken them. But when fear is gone, they lash you with sharp tongues grudging over wealth. These people are not believers, so Allah has rendered their deeds null and void. And that is easy for Allah"
  33,20,"They (hypocrites) think the confederates are not gone. And should the confederates come again, they would like to be in the deserts with the Bedouins asking for news about you. And were they to be with you, they would hardly fight"
  33,21,"Certainly you have in the Messenger of Allah an excellent example for anyone who turns to Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah much"
  33,22,"And when the believers saw the Confederates, they said, \"This is what Allah and His Messenger promised us, and Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. And it increased in them nothing but faith and submission"
