quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,And a sign to them is that We bore their race in the laden ship (Noah's Ark)
  36,42,"And We have created for them the like thereof, whereon they ride"
  36,43,"And if We so will, We may drown them, then there would be no one to respond to their cries for help, nor can they be rescued"
  36,44,(They cannot be rescued) except by mercy and provision from Us for a given time
  36,45,"And then it would be said to them, \"Take heed of what is ahead of you and what is behind you, so that mercy is shown to you"
  36,46,And there comes to them no Verse of the Verses of their Lord but they turn away from it
  36,47,"And when it is said to them, \"Spend out of what Allah has given you,\" those who disbelieve say to those who believe, \"Shall we feed him whom, if Allah wills, He could feed? You are not but clearly in error"
  36,48,"And they say, \"When will this promise (of the Last Day happening) come to pass, if what you say is true"
  36,49,"They await but a single deafening blast, which will overwhelm them while they squabble"
  36,50,"Then they will not be able to make a bequest, nor return to their families"
  36,51,"And when the trumpet is blown, to their Lord they will rush from their graves"
  36,52,"They will say, \"O woe to us! Who has raised us up from our graves? This is what the Gracious One had promised! And the Messengers did tell the truth"
  36,53,"It will but be a single dafening blast, after which they all shall be brought before Us"
  36,54,That Day then none shall be wronged even a bit; and you shall not be recompensed aught but for what you did
