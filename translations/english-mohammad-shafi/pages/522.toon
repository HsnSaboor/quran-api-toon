quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"Abraham said, \"What is your mission then, O Messengers"
  51,32,"They replied, \"We have indeed been sent towards a sinning people"
  51,33,To throw stones of clay upon them
  51,34,Targeted with your Lord upon those who go beyond all bounds
  51,35,We then evacuated all of the believers who lived therein
  51,36,"And We did not find therein any Muslims, apart from a single house"
  51,37,And We left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment
  51,38,"And in Moses [there is a sign] - when We sent him with a clear authority to Pharaoh"
  51,39,"And he [Pharaoh] turned in arrogance on the strength of his support, and he said (to his council of elders), \"He is a magician or a madman"
  51,40,"So then We seized him and his troops, and threw them into the sea. And he was to blame [for this fate]"
  51,41,"And in Aad [there is a sign] - when We sent upon them a devastating wind"
  51,42,"[The devastating wind] left nothing that it came upon without making it look like old and rotten bones"
  51,43,"And in Thamood [there is a sign] - when they were told, \"Enjoy yourselves for a while"
  51,44,They had behaved insolently towards the Command of their Lord! So then a thunderbolt struck them as they looked on
  51,45,They could not even stand up or help themselves
  51,46,And the people of Noah before them all — they were indeed a people immersed in transgression
  51,47,And the heaven - We made it powerful and We can certainly indeed expand it
  51,48,"And the earth - We prepared its crust, and how well have We prepared it"
  51,49,"And of everything We have created in pairs, so that you ponder over this and remember"
  51,50,"Flee, therefore, to Allah. I am indeed a plain warner to you from Him"
  51,51,And set up no other deity with Allah. I am indeed a plain warner to you from Him
