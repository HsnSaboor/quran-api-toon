quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,40,So that we might cheer the magicians if it is they who prevail
  26,41,"So when the magicians came, they said to Pharaoh, \"Are we not indeed entitled certainly to a reward if it is we who prevail"
  26,42,"Pharaoh said, \"Of course! And, indeed, in that case you shall be among those who are near to me"
  26,43,"Moses said to them: \"Cast down whatever you were to cast"
  26,44,"Then they did cast down their ropes and their staffs, and said, \"By Pharaoh's honour, behold, it is we certainly who shall prevail"
  26,45,And then Moses threw his staff. And lo! It swallowed up all their deceptions
  26,46,And the magicians fell down in prostration
  26,47,"They said: \"We believe in the Lord of the worlds"
  26,48,The Lord of Moses and Aaron
  26,49,"Pharaoh said, \"You believe him before I permit you? Indeed, he must be your master who has taught you magic! But you shall certainly come to know who the master is. I shall certainly cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and shall certainly crucify you, all together"
  26,50,"The magicians said, \"No matter! We shall indeed return to our Lord"
  26,51,We do indeed ardently desire that our Lord forgive us our faults now that we have been among the foremost to believe
  26,52,"And We conveyed to Moses Allah's instructions, \"Leave with My devotees (Children of Israel) by night. You will he pursued (by Pharaoh's army)"
  26,53,And then Pharaoh sent heralds to all cities/towns
  26,54,"These [Children of Israel] are but a small gang"
  26,55,And they have surely enraged us
  26,56,And we are indeed a vigilant multitude
  26,57,And so We made them (Pharaoh's people) come out of gardens and springs
  26,58,And We made them (Pharaoh's people) leave their treasures and places of honour
  26,59,"And [in course of time] We made the Children of Israel inheritors of such things"
  26,60,"Then they [Pharaoh's men] went in pursuit of them (Children of Israel) eastwards"
