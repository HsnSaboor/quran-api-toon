  16,44,"We had sent only men, to the earlier people, with clear signs/evidences and scriptures. And We have sent down to you the Reminder (the Qur'aan) that you may make clear to mankind what has been sent down for them, and that they may think about it"
  16,45,"Do they then who plan evil deeds feel confident that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them, or that punishment may not overtake them from whence they know not"
