quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,171,"And when We made the mountain shake over them like a shadow — and they thought that it was definitely going to fall down upon them — telling them, \"Hold firmly what We have given you, and take heed of what there is in it, so that you become pious"
  7,172,"And when your Lord brought forth, from Adam and his children, their offspring, and made them bear witness against their own souls, \"Am I not your Lord?\" they said, \"Yes! We bear witness.\" Lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, \"Indeed, we were unaware of this"
  7,173,"Or you should say, \"It was our fathers, before us, who worshiped others besides Allah, and we were only their offspring following them! Will You then destroy us for what those followers of falsehood did"
  7,174,"And thus do We explain the Verses, in details and so as to facilitate their return to the Right Path"
  7,175,"And recite to them the story of one to whom We gave Our Verses/signs, but he withdrew himself therefrom! The Satan then followed him, and he became one of those who deviate from the Right Path"
  7,176,"And if We had so willed, We would certainly have exalted him thereby; but he remained clinging to the earth and followed his base desires. His example then is that of the dog; if you assault him he lolls out his tongue, and if you leave him alone he lolls out his tongue! Similar is the example of those who reject Our Verses/signs. Relate the story then; perhaps they will reflect"
  7,177,"Evil is the example of people who reject Our Verses/signs, and are unjust to their own souls"
  7,178,"Whomsoever Allah guides, he is the one who follows the right way; and whomsoever He sends astray, these are the ones who are doomed"
