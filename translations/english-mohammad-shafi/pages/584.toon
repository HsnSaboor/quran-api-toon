quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,When his Lord called out to him by the sacred valley of Tuwa
  79,17,Go to Pharaoh! He has indeed exceeded all bounds
  79,18,"You then ask him, `Would you like to reform"
  79,19,"Would you allow me to guide you to your Lord, so that you fear Him"
  79,20,"Moses then showed him the great Sign [staff turning into snake and hand turning white]"
  79,21,"But he [Pharaoh] refused to acknowledge the divine Sign and obey Allah"
  79,22,He then turned his back hastily
  79,23,To summon and collect his people
  79,24,"He then proclaimed to them, \"I am your lord supreme"
  79,25,Allah then seized him for punishment both in the Hereafter and here
  79,26,There is indeed a lesson in this for those who fear Allah
  79,27,Are you more difficult to create or the heaven to construct
  79,28,HE raised its structure and then balanced it aright
  79,29,And made its night dark and its day bright
  79,30,And the earth thereafter — He spread it out
  79,31,He brought out from it its water and its pasture
  79,32,And He made the mountains firm
  79,33,"[He has provided] means of sustenance for you and your animals"
  79,34,So when the great event occurs
  79,35,That Day man would recount what he strove for
  79,36,And the Hell would be made manifest for all to see
  79,37,And then anyone who had transgressed divinely set bounds
  79,38,And had preferred the life of this world
  79,39,That one's abode shall indeed be in Hell
  79,40,And one who had been afraid of standing before his Lord and had restrained one's self from carnal desires
  79,41,That one's abode shall indeed be in Paradise
  79,42,"They ask you [Prophet] about the Hour (the time when the present world will end and the Hereafter begin), \"When is it coming"
  79,43,"What have you to do with the mentioning of it [the time of the occurrence of the Hour]"
  79,44,With your Lord rests the final and only Authority to know when the Hour would happen
  79,45,"You [Prophet] are but a warner for those who fear it [the Hour]"
  79,46,"The Day they see it [the Hereafter], they will feel as if they had stayed for only one evening or one morning thereof"
