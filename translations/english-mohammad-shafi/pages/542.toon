quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  58,1,"Allah has surely listened to what is said by the woman who disputeswith you (Muhammad) concerning her husband, and complains to Allah. And Allah listens to your dialogue. Allah does indeed hear, see everything"
  58,2,"Those of you who abstain from having conjugal relations with their wives by pronouncing them as their mothers (should know) they are not their mothers. None but those who gave them birth are their mothers. What they utter is most certainly wrong and a lie. And Allah is certainly indeed Lenient, Forgiving"
  58,3,"And those of you who abstain from having conjugal relations with their wives by pronouncing them as their mothers and afterward would go back on what they said — then freeing of a neck [slave] before they touch each other is what you are exhorted to do! And Allah is aware what you do"
  58,4,"Then he who finds not (a slave to free), let him fast for two successive months before they [husband and wife] touch each other. And for him who is unable to do so, the feeding of sixty needy persons [is the penance]. This, in order that you may believe in Allah and His Messenger. And this is the Law prescribed by Allah. And for those who suppress the Truth, there is a painful punishment"
  58,5,"Those indeed who work against Allah and His Messenger will be destroyed as those before them were. And We have surely sent down clear Verses/signs. And for those who suppress the Truth, a disgraceful punishment"
  58,6,On the Day when Allah will raise them all and give them an account of what they had done. Allah would have recorded it and they would have forgotten it. And Allah is Witness to all things
