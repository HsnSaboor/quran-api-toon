  34,36,"Say, \"My Lord does indeed amplify and straiten provisions for whomsoever He wills, but most of mankind knows this not"
  34,37,"And it is not your wealth, nor your children, that bring you close to Us; but (the piety of) one who believes and does good deeds. Such ones are entitled to double reward for what they do. And they are secure in their high positions"
  34,38,"And those who strive to work against Our Verses/signs, those will be brought for punishment"
