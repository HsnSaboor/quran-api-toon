quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,73,"O Prophet! Wage a struggle against the suppressors of the Truth and the hypocrites and be severe on them. And their abode is Hell, and it is the worst destination"
  9,74,"They swear by Allah that they did not utter, and certainly they did utter, the word signifying suppression of the Truth. And they suppressed the Truth after they had declared their faith in Islam. And they intended to do what they could not. And they avenged not except for this that Allah and His Messenger enriched them out of His grace.Now if they repent, it will be good for them. And if they turn back to their evil ways, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and in the Hereafter. And they shall have none to be close to or to help them on earth"
  9,75,"And there are those of them who sought a covenant with Allah, \"If He gives us out of His grace, we will certainly subscribe to the Welfare Fund, and we will certainly be of those who do good deeds"
  9,76,"But when He gave them out of His grace, they became miserly with it and they turned back and withdrew"
  9,77,So He made hypocrisy to follow them in their hearts till the Day when they shall meet Him because they broke their covenant with Allah and because they lied
  9,78,"Do they not know that Allah knows their hidden thoughts and their secret counsels, and that Allah is the great Knower of the unseen things"
  9,79,"As for those who criticise and scoff at the believers who obediently contribute to the Welfare Fund, and at the believers who find nothing to give but their earnings, Allah scoffs at such scoffers, and they shall have a painful punishment"
