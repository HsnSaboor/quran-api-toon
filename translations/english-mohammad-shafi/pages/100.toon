quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,135,"O you who beljeve! Be witnesses for Allah, standing up firmly on justice, even though it may be against your own selves, parents or relatives. Be they rich or be they poor, Allah is close to them both. So follow not vain desires, lest you deviate. And if you swerve or turn away, then, indeed, Allah is aware of what you do"
  4,136,"O you who believe! Believe in Allah, His Messenger, the Book He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Book He had previously sent down. He, who denies Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Hereafter, has gone far astray"
  4,137,"Indeed, those who believe and then suppress the Truth, and again believe and then suppress the Truth, and then go on suppressing the Truth! Allah will neither be disposed to forgive them nor to guide them to the Right Path"
  4,138,Let the hypocrites know that for them is a painful punishment
  4,139,"Do they, who take the suppressors of Truth, rather than the believers, as close friends, seek honour from those suppressors of Truth? But, then, all honour does indeed rest with Allah"
  4,140,"And it is certainly laid down for you in the Book that when you hear Allah's Verses being denied or ridiculed, you should not sit with those people until they enter another topic of talk; otherwise, you shall be like them. Indeed Allah shall gather the hypocrites and the deniers all together in Hell"
