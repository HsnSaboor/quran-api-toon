quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,"And, O my people! I ask you not for any material compensation for it; my reward is upon none but Allah. And I am not going to drive away those who believe. They shall certainly meet their Lord. And, on the other hand, I see you as an ignorant people"
  11,30,"And, O my people! Who is there to help me against Allah if I drive them away? Won't you reflect on this"
  11,31,"And I do not say to you that I have the treasures of Allah. And I do not know the unseen, and I do not say I am an angel, nor do I say that Allah will never grant any good things to those who are mean in your eyes. Allah knows well what is there in them. I would indeed be of the unjust, otherwise"
  11,32,"They said, \"O Noah! You did argue with us a great deal. Now bring us what you threaten us with, if what you say is the truth"
  11,33,"He said, \"Only Allah will bring it to you if He wills, and you won't be able to do anything to prevent it"
  11,34,"And if I intend to give you advice, my advice will not profit you if Allah intended that He should leave you go astray. He is your Lord, and to Him shall you be returned"
  11,35,"They do say, \"He has concocted it.\" Say, \"If I have concocted it, then it is my sin and I shall be punished for it. But the responsibility for the sin you commit shall not be on me.\"h"
  11,36,"And it was revealed to Noah, \"None of your people will believe except those who have already believed. So grieve not at what they do"
  11,37,"And construct the ark under Our supervision and guidance, and do not address Me for those who are unjust. They shall indeed be drowned"
