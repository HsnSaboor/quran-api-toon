quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  27,77,"And, indeed, it certainly is guidance and mercy for all the believers"
  27,78,"Indeed, your Lord will judge between them by His Decree. And He is the One Omnipotent, All-knowing"
  27,79,Put your trust then in Allah. You are indeed on the Truth manifest
  27,80,You cannot make the dead hear. And you cannot make the deaf to the call hear when they turn their backs and go away
  27,81,And you cannot guide the blind out of their liability. None can you make listen to you save those who believe in Our Verses/signs and then become Muslims (surrender to Allah's Will)
  27,82,"And when the word gets fulfilled about them, We shall bring out for them a creature from the earth, which will tell them that mankind had no real faith in Our Verses/signs. @ @ My undedrstanding of this Verse is that it applies to modern man's unabashed gobbling up of the theory of evolution. Protagonists of this theory assert that mankind evolved itself from lower forms of life through processes of natural selection and survival of the fittest. They reject the Qur'aanic assertion that a Super-intelligent, Omniscient and Omnipresent Being has consciously, deliberately or purposefully created mankind and everything else in the Universe. The thought of such a Creator is anathema for the atheists subscribing to the theory of evolution. This theory could well be the creature spoken of in this Verse, telling those who believe in it that they have no real faith in the Qur'aanic Verses/signs. In this context I invite my readers to go through my booklet Why Do I Believe In Islam"
  27,83,And on that Day We shall gather from within every community a host of those who considered Our Verses false. They will then be led in rows
  27,84,"And so when they shall come up before Allah, He will say, \"You considered My Verses false and you have had no thorough knowledge thereon!? What were you doing"
  27,85,"And the Word shall get fulfilled about them because of the wrong they had committed, and they will not speak"
  27,86,"Do they not see that it is We who had made the night for them to rest therein, and the day to make them see well? In this, indeed, there certainly are signs for people who believe"
  27,87,"And the Day the trumpet is sounded, everyone in the heavens and on earth will be seized with fear, except such as Allah wills. And everyone will come to Him humbly"
  27,88,"And you will see the mountains — which you consider firm — floating about like clouds. A creation of Allah, Who has ordered all things to perfection! He is indeed aware of all that you do"
