quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,And so no friend for him here today
  69,36,And no food except from discharged wastes
  69,37,Eat it not but the sinners
  69,38,But no! I swear by what you see
  69,39,And by what you do not see
  69,40,"This [the Qur'aan] certainly indeed is a noble Messenger's [Angel's] Word"
  69,41,And not that of a poet! Little do you believe
  69,42,Nor is it the word of a soothsayer! Little do you reflect
  69,43,It is a reveation from the Lord of the Universe
  69,44,"And had he [the Prophet] ascribed to Us some of his own sayings"
  69,45,We would surely have seized from him by the right hand
  69,46,And then severed from him the life vein
  69,47,And none of you could wit old Us from doing this to him
  69,48,"And, indeed, it [the Qur'aan] is a divine Counsel for those who fear Allah"
  69,49,And We do indeed know that some among you deny this
  69,50,"And, indeed, it [the Qur'aan] is certainly a cause of regret for those who suppress the Truth"
  69,51,"And certainly indeed it [the Qur'aan] is the absolute Truth"
  69,52,"Chant, then, the name of your Lord, the Almighty"
  70,1,A questioner questions punishment that is bound to befall
  70,2,Those who suppress the Truth. There is none to defend anyone
  70,3,"From Allah, Lord of the [many] ascents"
  70,4,"The time taken by the angels and the Spirit to ascend to Him is fifty thousand years [of man's reckoning]"
  70,5,"So, (O Prophet), be graciously patient [at the disbelievers' deliberate disbelief]"
  70,6,"They do indeed see it [punishment] long in coming"
  70,7,And We see it near
  70,8,"That Day, the sky will be like molten metal"
  70,9,And the mountains will be like wool
  70,10,And friend will not ask of friend
