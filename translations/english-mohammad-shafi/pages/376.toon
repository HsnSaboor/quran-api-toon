quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,Of what avail to them will all their past enjoyments be
  26,208,And never have We destroyed any community without being warned
  26,209,And reminded. And We wrong not
  26,210,And the devils had not brought it (the Message) down
  26,211,"And neither it is suitable to them, nor can they do it"
  26,212,They are indeed certainly debarred from hearing it
  26,213,"Hence invoke no god other than Allah, lest you be among those ponished"
  26,214,And warn your close relatives
  26,215,And lower wings of your tenderness over (be kind to) all of the believers who may follow you
  26,216,"If they then disobey you, say, \"I am indeed free of responsibility for what you do"
  26,217,"And put your trust in the Omnipotent, the Merciful"
  26,218,Who sees you standing
  26,219,And Who sees what goes on in your mind while you are among those who prostrate before Him
  26,220,"He is indeed the One Who hears, the One Who knows"
  26,221,Shall I tell you upon whom it is that the devils descend
  26,222,They descend upon all sinful turncoats
  26,223,They (the devils) pass on hearsays to them (sinful turncoats). And most of them (the devils) lie
  26,224,And the seducers follow the poets
  26,225,Do you not see that they (poets) roam about passionately in every valley
  26,226,And that they say what they do not do
  26,227,"Save those who believe, do righteous deeds, and remember Allah much. And they avenge themselves only after having been wronged and to the extent they are wronged.And those who do wrong will soon come to know how evil a turn they will turn to"
