quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,And create a good name for me among the later generations
  26,85,And place me among those who shall inherit the garden of bliss
  26,86,And forgive my father! He is indeed among those who have gone astray
  26,87,And put me not to shame on the Day of Resurrection
  26,88,"The Day on which neither wealth will be of any use, nor children"
  26,89,Except for a mind free of evil with which one comes before Allah
  26,90,And the Garden (Paradise) will be brought near for those who had spent their worldly lives within the parameters laid down by Allah
  26,91,And the Hell will be laid open before those who had allowed themselves to be seduced
  26,92,"And they will be asked: \"Where are those you worshipped"
  26,93,"Those, other than Allah, you worshipped? Can those be of any help to you or to themselves"
  26,94,"They will then be hurled into hell — they, as well as those who had seduced them"
  26,95,And the army of Iblees (the Satan) - all together
  26,96,"They will, blaming one another, say"
  26,97,"By Allah, we were indeed certainly in clear delusion"
  26,98,When we deemed you equal to the Lord of all the worlds
  26,99,And they who led us astray are none but the culprits
  26,100,And now we have none to intercede for us
  26,101,We have no anxious friend either
  26,102,"If only we had a return [to worldly life], so we could be among the believers"
  26,103,"There is indeed a sign in this, and most of them believe not"
  26,104,"And, indeed, your Lord — He alone — is the Omnipotent, the Merciful"
  26,105,The people of Noah did not believe the Messengers
  26,106,"When their brother Noah said to them, \"Are you not scared of wrongful living"
  26,107,I am indeed a trustworthy Messenger of Allah sent to you
  26,108,"Be, then, afraid of Allah, and obey me"
  26,109,"And no reward whatever do I ask of you for it: my reward rests with none but the Lord of the worlds"
  26,110,"Be afraid of Allah then, and obey me"
  26,111,"They said, \"Are we to believe you, when those who follow you are the most abject of people"
