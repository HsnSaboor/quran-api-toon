quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  89,24,"Man will say, \"Would that I had sent ahead for this life of mine"
  89,25,"Then, on that Day, Allah will punish him as none other can"
  89,26,And bind him as none other can
  89,27,O you contented soul
  89,28,"Return to your Lord pleased [with yourself], pleasing (to your Lord)"
  89,29,Enter then to be among My devotees
  89,30,And enter My Garden
  90,1,No! I do swear by this City
  90,2,— And you are a free citizen of this City —
  90,3,And by father and that which he begets
  90,4,We have certainly created man for hard work
  90,5,Does he think that no one has any control over him
  90,6,"He claims, \"I have squandered much wealth"
  90,7,Does he think no one is keeping a watch on him
  90,8,Have We not made two eyes for him
  90,9,And a tongue and two lips
  90,10,"And shown him the two ways [right and wrong]"
  90,11,But he ventures not up the steep road
  90,12,And what do you understand what the steep road is
  90,13,Freeing a slave
  90,14,Or feeding on a day of extreme hunger
  90,15,An orphan closely related
  90,16,Or miserable poor man
  90,17,"Then he becomes of those who believe and exhort one another to patience, and exhort one another to mercy"
  90,18,These are the people of the right hand
  90,19,"And those who suppress the Truth in Our Verses, those are the people of the left hand"
  90,20,On them is Fire closing in
