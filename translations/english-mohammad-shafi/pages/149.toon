quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,152,"And approach not the property of the orphan, but in the morally most appropriate manner, until he/she attains maturity. And give full measure and weight, with justice. We do not burden a person beyond one's capacity. And be just when you speak, even if it be to a near and dear one. And fulfill your obligation to Allah. This He has enjoined you with, that you may remember"
  6,153,"And this then is My Straight Path, so follow it. And follow not the paths that alienate you from His Path. This He has enjoined you with, that you may be pious"
  6,154,"Also, We gave Moses the complete Book for those who would do good deeds, with details on every thing, and as a guidance and a mercy, so that they should believe that they were scheduled to meet their Lord"
  6,155,And We have sent down this Book as a blessing. Follow it then and fear Allah so that mercy is shown to you
  6,156,"Lest you say, \"The Book was sent down only to two groups before us, and We were truly unaware of lessons therein"
  6,157,"Or lest you say, \"If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would certainly have been guided better than they.\" So now, surely, there has come to you a Clarification, Guidance and Mercy from your Lord.Who then is more unjust than he who rejects Allah's Verses/signs, and turns away therefrom? We will repay those who turn away from Our Verses/signs with an evil punishment because of their turning away"
