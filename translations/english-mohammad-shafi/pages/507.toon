quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,Those that suppress the Truth and cause hindrance in Allah's Path — He will let all their deeds go waste
  47,2,"And those who beieve and do righteous deeds and believe in what have been divinely sent down upon Muhammad — and that (what has been sent down) is the Truth from their Lord — He will efface their bad deeds, and He will set their condition right"
  47,3,"It is so because those who suppress the Truth pursue falsehood, and those who beieve pursue the Truth from their Lord. In this way does Allah give to mankind the similitudes of their lives"
  47,4,"Then when you confront in war those who suppress the Truth, smite their necks until you subdue them, and then take them securely into custody [as prisoners of war]. Thereafter [you may set them free,] either as an act of grace or against ransom, so that the burden of war is lifted. But thus it is — and had Allah so willed, He could indeed punish them Himself — so as to test you [all] by means of one another. And those that are killed in Allah's Path — He will never let their deeds go waste"
  47,5,"He will guide them, and set their condition right"
  47,6,"And He will admit them to the Garden [Paradise] as already described to them"
  47,7,"O you who believe! If you help Allah, He will help you, and He will consolidate your position"
  47,8,"And those that suppress the Truth — they are bound to face destruction, and Allah will let all their deeds go waste"
  47,9,That is so because they hate what Allah has sent down. And He then causes their deeds to come to naught
  47,10,"Have they not then travelled about on the earth and beheld what happened in the end to those who lived before their time? Allah brought about annihilation on them! And for those that suppress the truth, [He can bring about annihilations] like thereof"
  47,11,"That is because Allah is the Patron of all those who believe, whereas they who suppress the Truth have no Patron"
