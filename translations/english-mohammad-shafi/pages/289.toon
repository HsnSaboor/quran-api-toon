  17,68,Do you then feel secure that He will not crush you under a landslide or send upon you a violent storm? Then you may not find anyone to save you
  17,69,"Or, do you feel secure that He will not take you back into it (sea) another time, then send on you a stormy wind and thus drown you on account of your ungratefulness? Then you may not find anyone to help you against Us in the matter"
