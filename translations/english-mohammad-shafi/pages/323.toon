quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  21,11,"And many a town/village, whose inhabitants were cruel, did We shatter, and We raised up, thereafter, another people"
  21,12,No sooner did they perceive Our punishment coming than they began to flee therefrom
  21,13,"Flee not, and come back to the affluence you were accustomed to live in and to your homes for being questioned"
  21,14,"They said, \"O woe to us! We were wicked"
  21,15,And this cry of theirs continued till We made them like smouldering harvested field
  21,16,"And We did not create the heavens and the earth, and what is between them, for fun"
  21,17,"Had We wished to have some amusement, We would have derived it from within Ourselves, if at all.h"
  21,18,Nay! We cast the truth against the falsehood to demolish it (falsehood). And lo! Falsehood perishes. And woe to you for the (wrong) way you perceive things
  21,19,"And whoever is in the heavens and the earth is His. And those who are with Him are never too proud to worship Him, nor do they get weary"
  21,20,"They glorify Allah, night and day, without a break"
  21,21,Or have they taken gods whom they themselves have fashioned/designed out of the earth
  21,22,"Had there been in them any gods other than Allah, the two (the heavens and the earth) would certainly have been in a state of disorder. Glorified then is Allah, the Lord of the Throne, above all that they attribute to Him"
  21,23,He cannot be questioned concerning what He does but they (human beings) shall be
  21,24,"Or have they taken gods other than Him? Say, \"Produce your evidence! This is the precept (that there is no god besides Allah) for those with me and the precept for those before me.\" But most of them do not know the truth, and so they are intransigent"
