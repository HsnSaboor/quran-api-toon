  33,37,"And when you said to him whom Allah and you had shown favour to, \"Keep your wife to yourself and fear Allah!\" And you concealed in your heart what Allah would bring to light.

  33,43,He it is Who blesses you — and so do His angels — that He may bring you out of darkness into light. And He is ever Merciful to the believers
