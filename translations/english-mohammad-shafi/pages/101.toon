quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"These are they, who wait and watch to see how things shape for you. If there be a victory for you from Allah, they say: \"Were we not with you?\" And if the suppressors of Truth gain a share of success, they say, \"Did we not guard your interests and protect you from the believers.\" Then Allah will judge between you and them on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah has not provided a way for the suppressors of Truth to go (triumph) over the believers"
  4,142,"Indeed, the hypocrites strive to deceive Allah, and it is He, who deceives them! And when they stand up for prayer they stand with laziness. They do it only to show off to men and remember Allah but little"
  4,143,"Wavering in between — neither here nor there. And whomsoever Allah sends astray, you shall not find a way for him"
  4,144,"O you who believe! Do not take the suppressors of Truth, rather than the believers, for close friends. Do you wish that you yourselves should provide for Allah a manifest proof against you"
  4,145,"Indeed, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth of the Fire and you shall not find anyone to help them"
  4,146,"Except for those hypocites, who repent and make amends and hold on fast to Allah and keep their way of life purely for Allah. Then these are with the believers. And Allah will grant the believers a great reward"
  4,147,Why should Allah punish you if you are grateful and you do believe!? And Allah is aware as to who is grateful
