quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  39,57,"Or should anyone say, \"If only Allah had guided me, I should have been among the pious"
  39,58,"Or should anyone say on seeing the (gravity of the) punishment, \"O that I could have another chance, and then be among those who do good deeds"
  39,59,Yes (you had your chances)! My signs did come to you but you rejected them. And you behaved arrogantly and were among those who suppressed the Truth
  39,60,"And on the Day of Resurrection you shall see the faces, of those who had lied against Allah, blackened! Is not the (proper) abode, for arrogant people, in Hell"
  39,61,And Allah will save the Allah-fearing on account of their success in resisting the evil. No harm shall touch them nor shall they grieve
  39,62,Allah is the Creator of everything. And He is the Manager of affairs for everything
  39,63,He (Allah) has the keys of the heavens and the earth. And those who suppress Allahճ signs — they will be the doomed ones
  39,64,"Say, \"O you ignorant people! Do you tell me to worship anyone other than Allah"
  39,65,"And, most certainly, it was revealed to you and to all Prophets before you that if you worship anyone besides Allah, your deeds will certainly be worthless and you will certainly be among the doomed ones"
  39,66,So then worship Allah alone and be among those that are grateful
  39,67,"And they have not given Allah the Honour that is due to Him! On the Day of Resurrection the entire earth will be in His grasp, and the heavens shall be folded up in His Right Hand. Glorified and Exalted is He from all that they worship besides Him.a"
