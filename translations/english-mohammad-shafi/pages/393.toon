quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  28,60,And anything that is given to you is for the life of this world and its charm. And that which is with Allah is better and lasting. Why do you not understand
  28,61,"Is he whom We have given a good promise, which he will find fulfilled, like him whom We have given the comfort of the life of this world, then on the Day of Resurrection he will be of those brought to justice"
  28,62,"And on the day when He will summon them and ask, \"Where are My partners whom you imagined did exist"
  28,63,"Those concerning whom the Word shall have come true will say, \"Our Lord! These are they whom we led astray. We led them astray because we ourselves were astray. We declare our dissociation from them to You! They did not worship us"
  28,64,"And they will be told, \"Call those whom you worshipped besides Allah.\" And they will call them, but they will give no answer to them! And they will see the punishment before them. Ah, had they but been guided"
  28,65,"And on the Day when He will summon them and ask, \"What was your response to the Messengers"
  28,66,"Then, that Day, they will be blind to all that the Messengers had told them. Nor will they question one another about it"
  28,67,Then he who repents and believes and does right deeds — he may be among the successful ones
  28,68,And your Lord creates what He wills; and He chooses that which is good for them. Glorified is Allah and Exalted above all that they worship besides Him
  28,69,"And your Lord knows what they conceal in their minds, and what they reveal"
  28,70,"And He is Allah; there is none to worship other than Him. His is the praise in this, and in the other world. And His is the Command, and to Him you all will be brought back"
