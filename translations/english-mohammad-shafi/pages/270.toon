quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,27,"Then on the Resurrection Day He will disgrace them and ask, \"Where are they whom you worshipped besides Me, and for whose sake you caused discord?\" Those who are endowed with knowledge will say, \"Indeed, the disgrace and the evil, this day, shall be upon those who had suppressed the Truth"
  16,28,"Those that the angels caused to die while they indulged in deeds, which were ultimately injurious to their own selves. Then they would submit, \"We didn't do anything bad.\" Aye! Allah does indeed know what you did"
  16,29,"Enter then the gates of Hell, to be there forever! And the dwelling place of the arrogant people is certainly bad"
  16,30,"And those who fear Allah are asked, \"What is it that your Lord has sent down?\" They say, \"That which is good.\" There is goodness for those who do good deeds in this world. And certainly the abode of the Hereafter is better. And excellent certainly is the abode of those who fear Allah"
  16,31,"They shall enter gardens of perpetuity, having rivers flowing beneath them. They shall have, in them, what they please. Thus does Allah reward those who fear Him"
  16,32,"Those that the angels caused to die while they did good deeds, the angels saying to them, \"Peace upon you! Enter the garden as a reward for what you did"
  16,33,"They do not wait for anything but that the angels should come to them or that the Commandment of your Lord should come to pass. This is what those before them did. And Allah oppressed them not, but they oppressed themselves"
  16,34,So the bad things they did shall afflict them and the things they mocked at shall besiege them
