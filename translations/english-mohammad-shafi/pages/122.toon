quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"And when they listen to what has been sent down upon the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth they recognise. They say, \"Our Lord! We believe, so enlist us among those who give witness"
  5,84,And why should we not believe in Allah and in that which has come to us of the truth? And we earnestly desire that our Lord admits us to be with the righteous people
  5,85,"Allah then would reward them, on account of what they say, gardens, with rivers flowing underneath, to abide therein. And this is the reward of those who do good deeds"
  5,86,And those who suppress the Truth and treat Our Verses/signs as lies — they are the dwellers of the Fire
  5,87,"O you who believe! Forbid not the good, wholesome things which Allah has made lawful for you, and transgress not! Indeed, Allah loves not those who transgress"
  5,88,"And eat of the lawful and good, wholesome things that Allah has provided for you, and fear Allah, Whom you believe"
  5,89,"Allah does not call you to account for anything trivial in your oaths, but He calls you to account for the binding terms of your oaths. The expiation of it, then, is the feeding of ten poor persons with the average food you feed your families with, or their clothing, or the freeing of a neck. And for the one, who cannot afford, three days of fasting. This is the expiation of your oaths when you take them. And guard your oaths! Thus Allah does make clear to you His Verses, so that you may feel grateful"
