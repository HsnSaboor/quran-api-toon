  19,65,The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is in between them. So worship Him and be patient in worshipping Him. Do you know any one equal to Him
  19,66,"And says man, \"When I am dead and gone, shall I even then certainly be brought out alive"
  19,67,"Does not man remind himself that We had created him before, when he was nothing"
  19,68,"And, by your Lord, We will most certainly gather them and the satanic people together. Then shall We certainly cause them to be present around Hell on their knees"
  19,69,"Then We will most certainly pull out from every group one who had transgressed most against Allah, the Gracious"
  19,70,And We do certainly know best those who deserve most to be burned therein
  19,71,"And there is not one of you, but shall come to it. For your Lord this is a decree already issued"
  19,72,"And We will save (from Hell) those who fear Allah, and We will consign the wrongdoers therein on their knees"
  19,73,"And when Our clear Verses/signs are recited to them, those who disbelieve say to those who believe, \"Which of the two groups of us are better in position and well organised"
  19,74,And how many of the generations have We destroyed before them who were apparently well established
  19,75,"Say, \"The Gracious Allah will surely give a long lease to all those who have gone astray, until they see what they were warned about: the punishment or the Hour. Then they shall know who is worse in position and weaker in force"
  19,76,And Allah increases guidance of those who go by the Guidance. And lasting good deeds are better for reward with your Lord and yield better return
