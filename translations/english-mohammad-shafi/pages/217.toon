quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,71,"And recite to them the story of Noah when he said to his people, \"O my people! If my stay and my reminding (you) of the signs/Verses of Allah is hard on you — and on Allah yet do I rely — then combine your efforts and of those whom you worship besides Allah, then let not your effort remain dubious to you, then have it executed against me and give me no respite"
  10,72,"And if you turn away, I did not ask for any reward from you; my reward is only with Allah. And I am commanded that I should be of those who submit"
  10,73,"Then they rejected him, so We saved him, and those with him, in the Ark, and We made them vicegerents and drowned those who rejected Our Verses/signs. See then what happened in the end to those who were warned"
  10,74,"Then did We raise up after him Messengers to their people, and they came to them with clear evidences. But they could not believe in what they had rejected before. Thus it is that We set seals upon the hearts of those who exceed the limits"
  10,75,Then did We raise up after them Moses and Aaron and send them to Pharaoh and his nobles with Our signs. But they were too proud and they were a sinning people
  10,76,"So when the truth came to them from Us they said, \"This indeed is magic manifest"
  10,77,"Moses said, \"Do you say this of the truth when it comes to you? Is this magic? And the magicians prevail not"
  10,78,"They said, \"Have you come to us to turn us away from what we found our fathers upon, and is greatness bestowed just on you two on earth? And we are not going to believe in you"
