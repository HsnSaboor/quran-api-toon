  4,24,"And the married among the women other than those whom your right hands possess.h This is Allah's ordinance for you! And permitted for you are women other than those, provided that you seek marriage — and not extramarital sex — with them with your own means. On consummation of the marriages, then, give them their obligatory wedding gifts. And no blame on you in what you mutually agree upon, after fulfilling the obligation.Indeed, Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise"
  4,25,"And whoever amongst you has not been in a position to marry free believing women then let him marry those from among slave-girls who have become believers. And Allah does know your faith. You are of one another. Marry those of them then — with the permission of their masters, and giving them their wedding gifts properly — who are chaste and do not seek extramarital sex taking you as just boyfriends for the purpose. And if, after marriage, they commit fornication, their punishment is half that for free women. This is for the one amongst you who fears falling into sin otherwise. And it is better for you to be patient. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  4,26,"Allah wishes to recount to you the customs of people, who lived before you, and to guide you and forgive those of you who repent their transgressions. And Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise"
