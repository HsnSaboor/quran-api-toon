quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,88,"Those of the nobility among his people, who were arrogant, said, \"We will certainly drive you, and those who have believed with you, out, O Shu'aib, from our place, unless you return to our way of life.\" He said, \"Even when we dislike it"
  7,89,"We should be forging a lie against Allah if we return to your way of life after Allah has delivered us from it. And it befits us not that we should return to it, unless Allah, our Lord, so wishes. Our Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. In Allah do we trust. Our Lord! Decide justly between us and our people. And You are the Best of judges"
  7,90,"And those of the nobility among his people, who suppressed the Truth, said, \"If you follow Shu'aib, then surely you are doomed"
  7,91,"A violent shaking seized them then, and they lay lifeless in their abode"
  7,92,"Those who denied Shu'aib, they were as though they had never flourished therein; those who denied Shu'aib, they were the ones who were doomed"
  7,93,"He then turned away from them and said, \"O my people! I have indeed delivered to you the Messages of my Lord and I have given you good advice. How can I then grieve over people who suppressed the Truth"
  7,94,And We sent not a Prophet to a place but We seized its people with adversity and distress so that they became compliant
  7,95,"We then changed the bad condition to good until they grew in prosperity and said, \"Distress and ease did befall our fathers.\" Then, all of a sudden, We caught them unawares"
