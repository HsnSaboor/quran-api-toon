quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  36,71,"Do they not see that We have created — of things Our hands have wrought — cattle for them, so they become their masters"
  36,72,"And We have made the cattle subservient to them, so some of them they ride, and some they eat"
  36,73,"And for them therein there are other benefits, and they get milk therefrom to drink. Will they not then be grateful"
  36,74,And they take gods besides Allah hoping to be helped
  36,75,"They (gods other than Allah) are incapable of helping them, and yet they (the polytheists) consider them (the gods) a host at their beck and call"
  36,76,So let not what they say grieve you. We do indeed know what they conceal and what they proclaim
  36,77,"Does not man see that We have created him from a little thing of fertilized ovum? And, lo, he has become an open adversary"
  36,78,"And he (man) compares us to material things and forgets his own creation. He says, \"Who will bring the bones to life, when they are rotten"
  36,79,"Say, \"He will bring life back to them, Who had brought them into existence in the first place. And He knows the entire creation"
  36,80,"He Who makes fire for you out of the green tree, the fire with which then you kindle"
  36,81,"Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth capable of creating the like thereof? Yes, of course! And He is the Creator, fully aware of all things"
  36,82,"When He intends anything, His command to it is just to say, \"Be\", and it is"
  36,83,Glory then to Him in Whose hand is the sovereignty over all things! And to Him is your return
