quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"And when they are told, \"Come, Allah's Messenger will pray to Allah that you be forgiven\", they shake their heads! And you see them turning arrogantly away"
  63,6,It is all the same for them whether you pray that they be forgiven or you do not pray; Allah will not forgive them! Allah does indeed not give guidance to the transgressors
  63,7,"It is they who say, \"Do not spend anything on those who are with Allah's Messenger, until they break away from him.\" And Allah's are the treasures of the heavens and the earth. But the hypocrites do not understand this truth"
  63,8,"They say, \"If we do return to the City, the honourable ones will surely drive out therefrom the downtrodden!\" And all honour belongs to Allah, and to His Messenger, and to those who believe. But this, the hypocrites do not know"
  63,9,"O you who believe! Let not your wealth or your children distract you from remembrance of Allah. And if any do that — it is they, they who are the ones doomed"
  63,10,"And spend out of what We have provided for you, before the death approaches any of you, and that one then says, \"My Lord! If only You would give me a little more time, so that I could pay due Sadaqah and be among the righteous"
  63,11,But Allah does not give a human being more time when his term expires. And Allah is well aware of what you do
