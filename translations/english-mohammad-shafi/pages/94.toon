quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,"Not equal are those among the believers who sit back at home — disabled men excepted — and those who strive in Allah's Path with their wealth and with their persons. Allah has favoured those, who strive with their wealth and with their persons, with higher rank than those who sit back. And Allah has promised the good to both, but Allah has favoured those who strive, over those who sit back, with a great reward"
  4,96,"Ranks from Him and forgiveness and mercy. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  4,97,"While causing those persons to die who were unjust to their own souls, the angels did indeed ask them, \"Why were you so in there?\" They said, \"We were in a weak position on the earth.\" The angels asked, \"Was not Allah's earth spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?\" These people then would have their abode in Hell, and it is an evil destination"
  4,98,"Except the weak from among the men, women and children who neither have the means nor can they find a way"
  4,99,"Allah may then pardon such people. And Allah is Lenient, Forgiving"
  4,100,"And whoever emigrates in Allah's Path, he will find on the earth many places of refuge and abundance. And whoever leaves home as an emigrant unto Allah and His Messenger, and then death overtakes him, his reward falls due upon Allah. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  4,101,"And when you are on a journey on the earth, no sin upon you if you shorten the prayer out of fear that those who suppress the truth may cause you mischief. Indeed, the suppressors of truth are your open enemy"
