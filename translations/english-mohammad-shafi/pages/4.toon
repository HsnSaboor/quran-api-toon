  2,18,"Being deaf, dumb and blind, they return not"
  2,19,"Or, their situation is as in a rainstorm from the sky, that is accompanied by darknesses and thunder and lightning! They thrust their fingers in their ears to keep out the thunderbolts, fearing death. And Allah encompasses the suppressors of Truth"
  2,20,"The lightning almost snatches their sights away! Whenever it flashes for them, they move forward in its light, and, when darkness falls on them, they stop. And, had Allah so willed, He could indeed have taken away their hearing and their sights. Allah certainly has power over everything"
  2,21,"O mankind! Worship your Lord - Who created you and those before you, so that you may become God fearing"
  2,22,"The Lord Who made the earth a habitable placefor you, and the sky, a generator of means to provide sustenance ! And He sent down water from the sky. Then He brought out therewith — from the produce — sustenance for you. Do not then knowingly instal false rivals to Allah"
  2,23,"And if you are in doubt concerning what We have sent down unto Our Devotee, then come up with a Chapter like one thereof and call your witnesses — other than Allah — for your aid, if you are truthful"
