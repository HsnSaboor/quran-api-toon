  3,1,Alif-lam-meem
  3,2,"Allah — none worthy of worship but He, the Living, the Eternal"
  3,3,"He has bestowed upon you the Book with the Truth, confirming what came before it. And He had bestowed the Torah and the Gospel"
  3,4,"Earlier, as guidance for mankind. And He bestowed the Criterion. Indeed for those who reject Allah's Verses, there shall be stern punishment. And Allah is Omnipotent and has the power to give a fitting retribution"
  3,5,"Nothing indeed is hidden from Allah in the earth, nor in the heavens"
  3,6,"It is He Who designs you, in the wombs, as He pleases. There is none worthy of worship besides Him, the Omnipotent, the Wise"
  3,7,"It is He Who has sent down the Book upon you. Therein are Verses that are unambiguous and authoritative — these form the essence of the Book — and therein are other Verses, the interpretation of which is not clear to mankind. Those then with dishonesty in their minds, zealously pursue what is not clear thereof, seeking mischief and seeking its interpretation; but no one knows its interpretation but Allah. And persons, deeply versed in knowledge, say, \"We believe in it; it is all from our Lord.\" And none but those endowed with insight receive admonition.h"
  3,8,"They say, \"Our Lord, do not let our hearts deviate from the truth after you have guided us, and grant us mercy from You; You are the Grantor of bounties without measure"
  3,9,"Our Lord, You will surely gather all mankind before You on the Day about which there is no doubt; surely Allah does not break His promise"
