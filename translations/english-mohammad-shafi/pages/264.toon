quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  15,32,"Allah asked, \"O Iblees! What excuses have you that you are not with those who prostrated"
  15,33,"Iblees said, \"I am not the one to prostrate to a man whom You have created of clay, of moulded mud"
  15,34,"Allah said, \"Then get out of here! You are indeed damned"
  15,35,And indeed the curse is on you till the Judgment Day
  15,36,"He said, \"My Lord! Then give me respite till the time when they are raised"
  15,37,"Allah said, \"You are granted the respite"
  15,38,For the appointed period
  15,39,"He said, \"My Lord! As You have made me deviate from the right way, I will certainly keep them enthralled in the earth, and I will certainly cause them all to deviate"
  15,40,Except for those among them who worship you devotedly and exclusively
  15,41,"Allah said, \"This is the Path that leads straight to Me"
  15,42,"Indeed, you shall have no power over My subjects, except those who follow you in deviating from the right way"
  15,43,And indeed Hell is the place promised to them all
  15,44,It has seven gates assigned separately to separate sections of them
  15,45,And those who fear Allah shall indeed be in gardens and fountains
  15,46,They shall enter there in peace and security
  15,47,And We will clean their hearts of any rancour. They shall be on couches face to face as brethren
  15,48,"They shall not have to suffer any fatigue therein, nor shall they be ever ejected from it"
  15,49,"Inform my subjects that I am the Forgiver, the Merciful"
  15,50,And that My punishment is the painful one
  15,51,And tell them about Abraham's guests
