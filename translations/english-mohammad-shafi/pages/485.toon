quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  42,16,"And those that would quarrel about Allah after the response He has been accorded, all their contentions are null and void in the sight of their Lord. And upon them will fall [His] wrath, and for them is severe suffering in store"
  42,17,"It is Allah Who has sent down the Book with the truth and the balance [wherewith to conduct one's life on principles of justice]. And who knows, the Hour (the time when the present world will end and the Hereafter begin) may well be near"
  42,18,"Those who do not believe in it ask for hastening it. And those who believe, fear it and know it to be the truth. Beware! Those who entertain doubts about the Hour have certainly indeed gone far astray"
  42,19,"Allah is most kind to His subjects. He provides for them as much as He wills. And He is most strong, the Omnipotent"
  42,20,"One who is desirous of a harvest in the Hereafter, We shall grant an increase in that one's harvest there. And one who is desirous a harvest in this world, We give him something thereof, And he will have no share in the blessings of the Hereafter"
  42,21,"Do they have gods, other than Allah, which enjoin upon them a religious law that Allah has not prescribed!? Had it not been for divine decree on the final judgment, their matter would indeed have been decided [in this world itself]. And, indeed, painful punishment awaits the wicked people"
  42,22,"You will see the wicked people fearful of what they have earned, and the evil effects of what they had earned falling back upon them, themselves. And [you will see] those who had believed and had done righteous deeds living among the flowering meadows of the gardens of Paradise. They shall have what they want, with their Lord. That is the greatest favour [a human being can achieve]"
