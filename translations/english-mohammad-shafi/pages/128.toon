quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,1,"The praise is for Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and made the darknesses and the light. Yet, those who suppress the Truth sit in judgement over the attributes of their Lord"
  6,2,"He it is Who created you from clay, and then decreed a term. And it is a term denominated with Him. But, then, you are in doubt"
  6,3,"And it is Allah Who pervades the heavens and the earth. He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn"
  6,4,"And no sign/Verse has ever come to them, of the signs/Verses of their Lord, from which they have not turned aside"
  6,5,They did reject the truth when it came to them. And the details of what they mocked at will soon come to them
  6,6,"Do they not see how many a generation We destroyed before them? We have not established you as firmly as We had established them on the earth. And We made the sky pour rain on them in abundance, and We made the rivers flow beneath them. Then We destroyed them on account of their sins and raised up, after them, other generations"
  6,7,"And even if We had sent to you a book on paper so that they could touch it with their hands, those who suppress the Truth would certainly have said, \"This is nothing but pure magic"
  6,8,"And they say, \"Why has not an angel been sent down to him?\" And had We sent down an angel, the matter would have certainly been decided then and there, and they would have been given no respite"
