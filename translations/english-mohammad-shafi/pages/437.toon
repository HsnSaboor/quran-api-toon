  35,19,And the blind and the one who is able to see are not alike
  35,20,Nor are the darkness and the light alike
  35,21,Nor are the shade and the heat alike
  35,22,And the living and the dead are not alike. Allah does indeed make one hear whom He wills. And you cannot make those ones hear who are in the graves

  35,24,"We have indeed sent you with the Truth as a bearer of good news and a warner. And not a people, but a warner had been among them"

  35,30,"So that He may pay them back their rewards fully and give them more out of His grace. He is indeed Forgiving, Appreciative"
