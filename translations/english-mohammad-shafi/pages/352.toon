quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  24,21,"O you who believe! Follow not footsteps of the Satan. And whoever follows footsteps of the Satan, he does indeed then exhort doing things that are indecent and forbidden. And had it not been for Allah's favour upon you and His mercy, not one of you would have ever been pure! And Allah purifies whom He wills. And Allah hears all, knows all"
  24,22,"And let not those of you who are favoured with wealth and means swear against giving to the near of kin and to the poor and to those who have migrated in Allah's way. And they should forgive and forget. Do you not like that Allah forgive you? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  24,23,"Those who accuse chaste, unwary, believing women are indeed accursed in this world and in the Hereafter, and they shall have a grievously great punishment"
  24,24,Some Day their tongues and their hands and their feet shall bear witness against them as to what they did
  24,25,"On that Day, Allah will pay back to them justly and in full measure what they would deserve in accordance with their way of life on earth, and they shall know that Allah is the evident Truth"
  24,26,Bad women are for bad men and bad men are for bad women. Good women are for good men and good men are for good women. The latter are absolved of what evil people say about them. For them is ordained forgiveness and noble provision
  24,27,O you who believe! Do not enter houses other than yours until you have asked permission and greeted their inmates. It is good for you that way to remain mindful of good conduct
