quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  10,43,And there are those of them who appear to be looking at you. But can you give guidance to the blind even when they cannot see
  10,44,"Indeed, Allah does not wrong mankind in anything, but they wrong themselves"
  10,45,"And the day He will resurrect them and gather them all together, they will introduce one another as if they had halted but for a little while of daytime. Those who belied their meeting with Allah are indeed doomed, and they were not on right guidance"
  10,46,"And if We show you some of the things We promised to them, or if We cause you to die, yet to Us is their return, and Allah is witness to what they do"
  10,47,"And for every Ummaa Messenger. And when their Messenger came, they were judged equitably and they were not wronged"
  10,48,"And they ask, \"When will this prophecy come about, if what you say is true"
  10,49,"Say, \"I have no control over any harm, or any benefit, coming to me, except what Allah pleases. Every Ummah has its term. When their term comes, they shall not then remain here a moment more, nor can they go before their time"
  10,50,"Say, \"Have you ever considered that if His punishment overtakes you by night or by day, what then would there be for the sinners to ask for hastening of"
  10,51,And will you believe in it only when it comes to pass? What then!? And you did want it hastened
  10,52,"Then those who did wrong shall be told, \"Taste the everlasting punishment! Was it not but what you deserved"
  10,53,"And they ask you, \"Is that true?\" Say, \"Yes, by my Lord! It is indeed the truth. And you cannot elude it"
