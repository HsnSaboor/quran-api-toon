quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,Ageless youths serving them
  56,18,"[Serving] with vessels, jugs and a bowl of a pure original drink"
  56,19,They will not have a headache or will get drunk therewit
  56,20,"And [they will also be served] with [a variety of] fruits to choose from"
  56,21,And with meat of any fowl they desire
  56,22,"And [there will be] Houris with beautiful eyes"
  56,23,"[The eyes] like pearls hidden in their shells"
  56,24,All this theirs as a reward for what they did
  56,25,"No idle talk will they hear there, nor any sinful speech"
  56,26,All talk being of good and peace
  56,27,And those people on the Right — how will those people on the Right be
  56,28,"They shall be in the midst of trees [with fruit-bearing branches] bent down"
  56,29,And banana plants growing layers of fruit
  56,30,And extended shade
  56,31,And running water
  56,32,And fruits abundant
  56,33,Inexhaustive and unforbidden
  56,34,"And they shall be [comfortably seated on] raised couches"
  56,35,"We shall indeed have created them [female companions] into a new creation"
  56,36,And so shall have made them afres
  56,37,Loving and of same age group
  56,38,For the People on the Right
  56,39,"Many [of them will be] from the earlier peoples"
  56,40,And many from later times
  56,41,And those People on the Left — how will those People on the Left be
  56,42,In hot wind and boiling water
  56,43,And under the shadow of black smoke
  56,44,Neither cool nor soothing
  56,45,They had indeed been in luxury before
  56,46,And they had persisted in the Great Retraction
  56,47,"And they used to say, \"Once we are dead and are reduced to dust and bones, shall we then be raised to a new life"
  56,48,And our fore-fathers too
  56,49,"Tell them, \"Indeed all — the forefathers as also the later generations"
  56,50,They shall all be brought together on an appointed Day
