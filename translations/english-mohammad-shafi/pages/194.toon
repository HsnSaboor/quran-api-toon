quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,41,"Set out light and heavy, and strive hard in Allah's Path with your property and your persons! This is better for you, if you would know"
  9,42,"Had it been a near expedition and a short journey, they would certainly have followed you, but the long journey was too much for them. And they swear by Allah, \"If only we could, we would certainly have set out with you.\" They are killing their own souls, and Allah knows for certain that they are lying"
  9,43,May Allah pardon you (the Prophet)! Why did you exempt them before it became clear to you as to who were speaking the truth and you knew who the liars were
  9,44,Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day do not ask you to exempt them from exerting themselves in Allah's Path with their wealth and their persons. And Allah knows those who guard against evil
  9,45,"Only those, who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, ask you for exemption and their hearts are in doubt. And they waver in their doubts"
  9,46,"And if they had really intended to set out, they would certainly have prepared for it. But Allah did not like them proceeding, so He held them back. And they were told to sit back with those who sit back"
  9,47,"Had they been out in your midst, they would have added nothing but corruption in your ranks, and they would certainly have been active seeking dissension amongst you. And among you there are those who would listen to them. And Allah is aware of the wrong-doers"
