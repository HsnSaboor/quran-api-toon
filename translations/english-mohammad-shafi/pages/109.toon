quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,10,And those who suppress the Truth and deny our Verses/Signs — those shall be the dwellers of the Fire
  5,11,"O you who believe! Remember Allah's Favour upon you when people had planned to raise their hands against you, but He stayed their hands from you. And fear Allah! And in Allah let the believers put their trust"
  5,12,"And Allah did take a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We raised up among them twelve chieftains. And Allah said, \"I am indeed with you. If you establish prayer and give charity and believe in My Messengers and assist them and lend a good loan to Allah, I shall certainly condone your shortcomings, and shall certainly admit you to Gardens beneath which rivers flow. But whoever has suppressed the Truth from among you after that, he has surely lost the right way"
  5,13,"And then, because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them and made their hearts hard. They pervert the Word from its contextual sense and they have forgotten a part of what they were reminded of. And you will not cease to find treachery in them, except in a few of them. But then leave them alone and overlook. Allah does indeed love those who do good deeds"
