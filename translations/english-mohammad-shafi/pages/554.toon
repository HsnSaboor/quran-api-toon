quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  62,9,"O you who believe! When call to the prayer on Friday is sounded, hasten to [places of worship] for remembrance of Allah and leave the worldly business. That is good for you, if you but knew it"
  62,10,"Then as the prayer is ended, spread out on the earth to seek some of Allah's favours. And remember Allah much, so that you achieve success"
  62,11,"And when they see something of commercial or entertaining interest to them, they break away to go to it and leave you standing. Say, \"What is with Allah is far better than any entertainment or merchandise. And Allah is the Best Provider"
  63,1,"When the hypocrites come to you, they say, \"We bear witness that you certainly are a Messenger of Allah!\" And Allah knows that you certainly are His Messenger. And Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are certainly indeed false"
  63,2,They take cover of their oaths to turn others away from Allah's Path. It is indeed evil what they do
  63,3,"That is because they believe, and then suppress the Truth! Consequently, a seal has been set on their minds so that they can no longer understand"
  63,4,"And when you see them, their body language impresses you. And when they speak, you do listen to what they say. As if they were propped up puppets! They think that every cry is [directed] upon them. They are the real enemies, so beware of them! Allah's curse be on them! How very false are they"
