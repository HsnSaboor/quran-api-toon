quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,"None shall burn in it [the Fire] but the wicked person"
  92,16,"He who belies the Truth and turns away [from it]"
  92,17,"And, he will be distanced from it [Fire] who fears Allah"
  92,18,"He who spends his wealth [on others] to keep himself pure"
  92,19,— And he has none with him to be recompensed of favours received —
  92,20,"And he spends for nothing but to seek the pleasure of his Lord, the Most High"
  92,21,"And such persons, certainly, shall in time be well-pleased"
  93,1,By the morning brightness
  93,2,And by the night when it is still
  93,3,"Your Lord has not forsaken you [Prophet Muhammad], nor does He hate you"
  93,4,"And, surely, the latter part [of your life] will be better for you than the earlier"
  93,5,"And surely your Lord will give you [stability, security and authority], and then you will be happy"
  93,6,Did He not find you an orphan and give you shelter
  93,7,Did He not find you wandering and give you guidance
  93,8,Did He not find you poor and make you overcome poverty
  93,9,Oppress not the orphan then
  93,10,And scare not the beggar away
  93,11,And recount then the bounty of your Lord
  94,1,Have We not opened for you your head
  94,2,And lifted your burden off you
  94,3,"Which [burden] weighed upon your back"
  94,4,"And raised high the esteem, (in which) you (are held), for you"
  94,5,"With every difficulty then, indeed, there is a way out"
  94,6,"Indeed, with every difficulty there is a way out"
  94,7,"So then, when you get free (of your difficulty or from your worldly task), rise up"
  94,8,And turn to your Lord in complete devotion and submission
