  18,84,We did indeed give him authority on earth and means to pursue any thing he did
  18,85,So he followed a means
  18,86,"And when he reached a place as the sun declined in the west, he found it declining on a oligotrophic spring. And he found a people living near it. We said, \"O Zulqarnain! Cause them to suffer or treat them well"
  18,87,"He said, \"We will punish only the one who is wicked. He shall then be returned to his Lord, and He will punish him with a severe punishment"
  18,88,"And as for him who believes and does good deeds, he shall have good reward, and We will make Our command easy for him"

  18,96,"Bring me iron sheets.\" And when he had filled up the gap between the two mountain sides, he said, \"Blow!\" And when he had turned it red hot, he said, \"Bring me molten brass to pour over it"
  18,97,So they were not able to scale it nor could they breach it
