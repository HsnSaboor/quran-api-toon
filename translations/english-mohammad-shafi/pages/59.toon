quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,71,O People of the Book! Why do you clothe the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth knowingly
  3,72,"A section of the People of the Book say, \"Express belief in what is revealed to the believers early in the day, and express disbelief at the end of it; so that they may turn back"
  3,73,"And believe not that, except to one who follows your religion,\" — Say, \"Indeed, the (true) guidance is guidance of Allah.\"— \"anyone else could be given the like of what was given to you, or, could quarrel with you in the presence of your Lord.\" Say, \"All favour is indeed in the hand of Allah. HE grants it to whom He wills. And Allah is Pervasive, Knowledgeable"
  3,74,HE specifies for His Mercy whom He wills. And Allah has immense capacity to grant favours
  3,75,"And among the People of the Book is one who, if you entrust him with a treasure, will return it back to you. And among them is one who, if you entrust him with a single dinar, will not return it back to you unless you constantly keep on pressing him for it. That is the position because they say, \"We are not bound by any obligations to the illiterates.\" And theyh knowingly ascribe a lie to Allah"
  3,76,"Yes, indeed! Allah loves the pious people, such as one who keeps one's word and fears Allah"
  3,77,"Indeed, those who trade Covenants with Allah and their pledges for a petty price— those shall have nothing good for them in the Hereafter. Allah shall neither speak to them nor look at them on the Day of Resurrection. And He shall cleanse them not; and, for them, a painful punishment"
