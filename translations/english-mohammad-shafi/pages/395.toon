quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,78,"Korah said, \"I have been given it only becuse of my knowledge.\" Did he not know of the generations, before him, that Allah had already destroyed, who were mightier than him in strength and greater in manpower? The sinners are not questioned about their sins (before they are destroyed here in this world)"
  28,79,"And so he went out before his people in his pomp. Those who were desirous of the life of this world said, \"Ah! Would that we had the like of what Korah has been given. He does indeed possess an exceptionally great fortune"
  28,80,"But those who had been given knowledge said, \"Woe to you! Allah's reward is better for him who believes and does good deeds. And none but those who are patient shall get it"
  28,81,"Then We sank the earth with him and his house. Then he had no force to help him against Allah, nor was he of those who are helped"
  28,82,"And those who had coveted his (Korah's) place but yesterday exclaimed the morning after (Korah's sinking), \"Ah, well! Allah gives the provision for living in ample measure to whom He wills of His slaves and restricts it to whom He wills. Had Allah not been gracious to us, He would have sunk the earth with us. Ah, well! Those who suppress the Truth shall not attain salvation"
  28,83,We have prepared this Home of the Hereafter for those who desire not an exalted position — nor corruption — on the earth. And the good end is for those who are Allah-fearing and pious
  28,84,"He who comes with a good deed, he will have a reward better than what his deed deserved. And he who comes with an evil deed — those who do ill-deeds will be repaid with only what their deeds deserved"
