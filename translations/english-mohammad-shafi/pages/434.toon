quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,49,"Say, \"The Truth has come, and falsehood neither originates creation, nor reproduces it"
  34,50,"Say, \"If I err, I err only to my own detriment. And if I am right, it is because of what my Lord reveals to me. He does indeed listen, and He is indeed close"
  34,51,And if you could see them get terrified! But then there would be no escape; and they would be easily caught
  34,52,"And they would say, \"We do believe in it.\" And how could they attain salvation from a place out of bounds from the place (earth) where they could attain to it"
  34,53,And they did disbelieve in it before. And they threw stones at the unseen from a place too distant
  34,54,"And a barrier would be placed between them and that which they desire, as was done with those of their kind before. The sceptics would indeed be ever in doubt"
  35,1,"The praise is for Allah, Who originated the heavens and the earth, Who made the angels as messengers flying on wings, two, three, and four. He increases in creation what He wills. Allah is indeed Capable of doing anything"
  35,2,"Whatever of mercy Allah opens for mankind, there is none to wit old it. And what He wit olds none can send it thereafter. And He is Omnipotent, the Wise One"
  35,3,O Mankind! Recall Allah's favours upon you. Is there any creator besides Allah who provides for you from the heavens and the earth? There is none worthy of worship but He. How then are you fooled by falsehood
