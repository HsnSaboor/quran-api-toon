quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,"But no, you prefer this worldly life"
  87,17,Whereas the Hereafter is better and enduring
  87,18,"This fact, indeed, was [also stated] in the earlier Scriptures —"
  87,19,The Scriptures of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Have you heard about the Overwhelming Event
  88,2,Faces that Day will be down
  88,3,"Wrought-up, weary"
  88,4,Burning in Fire intensely hot
  88,5,Made to drink from a boiling hot spring
  88,6,No food for them but of thorns
  88,7,That neither nourishes nor satisfies hunger
  88,8,Faces that Day will be blissful
  88,9,Pleased with their efforts
  88,10,In lofty Garden
  88,11,Wherein no vain talk will you hear
  88,12,Therein a fountain flowing
  88,13,Therein thrones raised high
  88,14,And cups placed conveniently
  88,15,And cushions in rows
  88,16,And carpets spread out
  88,17,Do they not see how the cloud is created
  88,18,"And the sky, how it is raised high"
  88,19,"And the mountains, how they are rooted"
  88,20,"And the earth, how its surface is made"
  88,21,So recite the divine Verses to the people at large. Your only responsibility is to recite
  88,22,You have no control over them
  88,23,But he who turns back and suppresses the Truth
  88,24,Allah will give him the greatest punishment
  88,25,To Us indeed is their return
  88,26,Then it is for Us to call them to account
