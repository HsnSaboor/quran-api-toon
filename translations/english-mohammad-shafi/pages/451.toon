quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"But they rejected him (Elias), so they shall indeed certainly be presented (for punishment before the Lord)"
  37,128,Excpt for those who worship Allah alone devotedly
  37,129,"And We left on him [the salutation] among the later generations"
  37,130,Peace upon Elias
  37,131,We do indeed thus reward the good people
  37,132,He was indeed among Our believing subjects
  37,133,And Lot was certainly indeed one of those sent as Allah's Messengers
  37,134,"When We saved him and his family, all —"
  37,135,Except for an old woman who was left among those who remained behind
  37,136,"Then We destroyed the others [— other than those saved]"
  37,137,And you do indeed pass by them in the mornings
  37,138,And at night. Do you not then understand
  37,139,And Jonah was certainly indeed one of those sent as Allah's Messengers
  37,140,When he ran away to the laden ship
  37,141,And then he (Jonas) embarked the ship with others but was one of those thrown overboard (into the sea)
  37,142,And then the big fish swallowed him and he was himself to blame
  37,143,But had he not indeed been of those who glorify (Allah)
  37,144,He would have remained in its belly till the Day people are resurrected
  37,145,"Then We flung him on to the open shore, and he was sick"
  37,146,And We caused a gourd vine to grow up over him
  37,147,And We sent him to a constituency of a hundred thousand or more
  37,148,"And they believed, so We let them enjoy life for a while"
  37,149,"Now ask them (your people, O Muhammad) whether your Lord has daughters and they would like to have sons for themselves"
  37,150,"Did We create the angels as females, and did they witness their creation"
  37,151,Are they not just telling some of the lies they have themselves concocted
  37,152,"And (they say), \"Allah has children.\" And they certainly are liars"
  37,153,Has He preferred to have daughters over sons
