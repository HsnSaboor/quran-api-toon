  24,45,"And Allah has created every living creature from water.Then, of them, is that which walks on its belly, and, of them, is that which walks on two feet, and, of them, is that which walks on four. Allah creates what He pleases. Allah does indeed have power over all things"
  24,46,"We have certainly sent down Verses/signs making things clear, and Allah guides whom He pleases to the Right Path"

  24,49,"And if the truth lies on their side, they come to him obediently"

  24,53,"And they swear by Allah most solemnly that if you command them they would certainly come out (in Allah's path). Say, \"Swear not! Due compliance (is the thing required). Allah is indeed aware of what you do"
