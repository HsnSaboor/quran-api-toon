  7,164,"And when a section of them said, \"Why do you admonish a people whom Allah would destroy or give a severe punishment?\" They said, \"To be free of blame before your Lord! And, haply, they may fear Allah"
  7,165,"So when they forgot what they had been reminded of, We saved those who forbade evil and We severely punished those who did wrong, because they transgressed"
  7,166,"And when they revoltingly persisted in what they had been forbidden, We said to them, \"Be apes, despised and hated"
  7,167,"And when your Lord declared that He would certainly impose upon them, till the Day of Resurrection, those who would treat them badly, your Lord indeed is quick to requite and indeed He is Forgiving, Merciful!h"
  7,168,"And We broke them, on the earth, into groups; some of them are righteous and some of them are not. And We tried them with good things and bad, so that they might turn back to the Right Path"

  7,170,"And as for those who hold fast to the Book and establish proper prayer, We do not indeed cause the reward of the doers of good to go waste"
