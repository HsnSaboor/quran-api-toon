quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,"Those, indeed, who do not believe in the Hereafter give angels female names"
  53,28,"And they have no knowledge thereon [on creation of angels]. They but follow their conjecture and conjecture can avail nothing indeed against the Truth"
  53,29,So keep away from those who turn away from remembering Us and who seek nothing but the life of this world
  53,30,"That [life of this world] is all they know! Indeed it is your Lord Who knows those who have strayed away from His Path and it is He Who knows those who are guided"
  53,31,And To Allah belong all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth to requite the evil- doers for their deeds and to requite those who have done good deeds with a good reward
  53,32,"Those who avoid grave sins and shameful deeds, lesser offences notwithstanding — for those indeed your Lord abounds in forgiveness. He knows you since He raised you from the earth, and while you were unseen inside your mothersԠwombs. Consider yourselves not then as pure and highly born! He knows those that are pious"
  53,33,Have you seen the person that turns away (from Allah's Path)
  53,34,"And he/she gives a little, and then stops"
  53,35,"Does he have any knowledge of the Unseen, and is so aware of it"
  53,36,Is he not informed of what is there in the Scripture of Moses
  53,37,"And of Abraham, who was true to his word"
  53,38,That no bearer of a burden shall bear the burden of another
  53,39,And that man gets nothing but what he strives for
  53,40,"And that his striving shall be [critically] seen"
  53,41,And then he shall be fully compensated
  53,42,And that to your Lord is the End
  53,43,And that He it is Who makes people laugh and cry
  53,44,And that He it is Who causes death and gives life
