quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,26,"And Pharaoh said, \"Leave killing of Moses to me, and let him pray to his Lord. I do indeed fear that he will change your way of life or that he will cause anarchy to spread in the land"
  40,27,"And Moses said, \"I do indeed seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant person who believes not in the Day of Account-taking"
  40,28,"And a believing man of Pharaoh's family, who concealed his faith, said, \"Would you kill a man because he says, `My Lord is Allah,' and has brought you clear evidences from your Lord? If he is lying, he will himself suffer therefor; and if he is truthful, then something of what he warns you of will strike you. Allah does indeed guide not one who is a lying transgressor"
  40,29,"O my people! Today, you have the ruling authority, you having the upper land. But who would save us from the wrath of Allah should it come to us?\" Pharaoh said, \"I do but show you what I see, and I do but guide you to wise way"

  40,32,"And, O my people, I do indeed fear for you a Day of (general) Summons to all (dead) people [when they shall all rise alive and gather together for Allah to pronounce His judgment on everyone and everything]"
  40,33,"A Day when you will turn to flee, having none to defend you from Allah. And there is none to guide one whom Allah sends astray"
