quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,6,Allah's Promise! Allah never fails to keep His Promise. But most people know not
  30,7,"They know just what is apparent of the life of this world, and remain oblivious to the Hereafter"
  30,8,Have they never pondered over themselves!? Allah has not created the heavens and the earth and all that is therein without purpose and without fixing a time for their end! And most people do indeed disbelieve that they are destined to meet their Lord
  30,9,"Have they not travelled on the earth and seen what end those who lived before them met with? They were more powerful than these are, and they dug up the earth and built it up more than these are doing. And to them came their Messengers with clear signs. It was not Allah Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves"
  30,10,Then the end of those who did evil — in that they denied the Truth of Allah's Verses/signs and ridiculed them — is evil
  30,11,"Allah creates the creation from nothing. Then He recreates it. Then to Him, shall you all be returned"
  30,12,"And the Day the Hour is established, the criminals will stand despaired"
  30,13,And none among those they worshipped besides Allah could intercede for them. And they would disown those they worshipped besides Allah
  30,14,"And the Day the Hour is established, that Day they will be separated"
  30,15,"Then those who believed and did good deeds, they will rejoice in a Meadow of delight"
