quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  10,79,"And Pharaoh ordered, \"Bring to me every expert magician"
  10,80,"And when the magicians came, Moses said to them, \"Cast down what you have to cast"
  10,81,"So when they cast down their contraptions, Moses said to them, \"What you have brought is deception. Allah will indeed bring it to naught. Allah does indeed not promote the work of those who spread discord"
  10,82,"And Allah will show the truth to be the truth by His commands, even though the criminals may not like it"
  10,83,"So then none believed in Moses — except for the progeny of his own people — out of fear of Pharaoh and their nobles, lest he should persecute them. And indeed did Pharaoh have some power on the earth and indeed he was of those who committed excesses"
  10,84,"And Moses said, \"O my people! If you do believe in Allah and if you are of those who do submit to Him, then do trust Him"
  10,85,"So they said, \"On Allah do we trust. O our Lord! Subject us not to the persecution of the unjust people"
  10,86,"And do deliver us, by Your mercy, from the people who suppress the Truth"
  10,87,"And We told Moses and his brother, \"Prepare some houses in Egypt as spiritual centres for your people and establish prayer. And give good tidings to the believers"
  10,88,"And Moses said, \"Our Lord! You have indeed given Pharaoh and his nobles glamour and riches in the life this world. Our Lord! You have given them this so that they go astray from Your Path. Our Lord! Spread destruction over their riches and harden their hearts so that they believe not until they see the painful punishment"
