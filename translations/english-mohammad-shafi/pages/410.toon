quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"And if We send a wind and they see it (the green earth) turn yellow (giving man its yield), verily, they still continue ungratefully to disbelieve (in Allah's Mercy)"
  30,52,"And you cannot indeed make the dead hear, nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs and go away"
  30,53,"And, nor can you advise the blind out of their straying. You can make none to hear except those who believe in Our Verses/signs and then submit"
  30,54,"It is Allah who created you weak, then made you strong after being weak, and then made you weak and grey-haired after being strong. HE creates as He wills. And He is the One knowing all, capable to do anything"
  30,55,"On the Day the Hour dawns, the criminals will swear they stayed not (in the earth) but an hour. Thus were they deluded"
  30,56,"And those who have been endowed with knowledge and conviction will say, \"Indeed you did stay there, in accordance with Allah's Book, until the Resurrection Day. Now, this is the Resurrection Day, but which you remained unaware of"
  30,57,"That Day then the wicked people shall not get any benefit from their excuses/apologies, nor shall they be allowed to solicit favours"
  30,58,"And, verily, We have given, in this very Qur'aan, every kind of example for mankind. And even if you come to them with a miraculous sign, those who suppress the Truth would say, \"You advocate nothing but falsehood"
  30,59,Thus does Allah put a seal on the minds of those who wish not to learn
  30,60,Be patient then! Allah's Promise is indeed true. And let not those who lack conviction disturb your mind
