quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,102,"That One is Allah, your Lord! There is no god but He. HE is the Creator of all things, so worship Him! And He is the One Who looks after all things"
  6,103,"No vision can grasp Him, and He grasps all visions. And He is Aware of the minutest detail"
  6,104,"Evidences have certainly come to you from your Lord. Whoever then sees the evidences, it is for his own good; and whoever is blind to them, it is to his own detriment! And I am not a guardian over you"
  6,105,"And thus do We variously explain the Verses/signs so that they say, \"You have repeated [what you had already said before]\" and that We may make it clear to people who know"
  6,106,Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord! There is no god but He. And turn away from those who worship others besides Allah
  6,107,"Had Allah so willed, they would not have worshipped others besides Him. And We have not appointed you as a caretaker over them. And you are not there to look after all their affairs"
  6,108,"And do not abuse those whom they pray to, besides Allah, lest they should abuse Allah out of enmity and ignorance. To every people thush We have made their own deeds look fair. Then to their Lord shall be their return when He will inform them of what they used to do"
  6,109,"And they swear by Allah, with the strongest of their oaths, that if a sign comes to them they would certainly believe therein. Say, \"Signs are only with Allah.\" And what should make you perceive that, when it comes, they will not believe"
  6,110,"and that We will turn their hearts and their sights away, as they failed to believe in it, first thing after its occurrence, and that We will leave them to wander blindly in their transgression?h"
