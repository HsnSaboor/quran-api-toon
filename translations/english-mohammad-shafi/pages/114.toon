quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,37,"They will long to go out of the Fire, and they shall find no way out therefrom. And, for them, it is a lasting punishment"
  5,38,"And cut off the hand each of the man who steals and the woman who steals, as an exemplary punishment from Allah for what they have earned. And Allah is Omnipotent, Wise"
  5,39,"And he who repents after he has committed his crime and reforms himself, then, indeed, Allah will accept his repentance. And Allah is indeed Forgiving, Merciful"
  5,40,Don't you know that to Allah belongs the absolute sovereignty over the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He wills and forgives whom He wills. And Allah has power over all things
  5,41,"O Messenger! Let not those make you sad, who are quick in suppressing the Truth from among those who say, with their mouths, \"We believe\" and their hearts do not believe, and from among those who are Jews. They listen to falsehood. They listen to others who do not come to you. They transpose the word after it had been placed in its proper context, saying, \"If you are given this, take it, and if you are not given this, beware!\" And if Allah wills to put anyone to distress and hardship, you can do nothing for him against Allah. Allah does not want to purify the hearts of such people. Disgrace it is for them in this world, and a grave punishment for them in the Hereafter"
