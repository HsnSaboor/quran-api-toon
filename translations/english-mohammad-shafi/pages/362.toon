quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,21,"And those who do not expect a meeting with Us say, \"Why are angels not sent down to us or why do we not see our Lord?\" They are certainly too proud of themselves and have greatly exceeded all bounds"
  25,22,There will be no good tidings for the guilty on the day they see the angels. And they will cry out for an invincible partition between them and the angels
  25,23,And We shall proceed to turn all that they did into scattered dust
  25,24,The inhabitants of the Garden will have the best abode and the finest place of rest on that Day
  25,25,On a Day when the sky will split open with its clouds and the angels after angels are sent down
  25,26,Sovereignty on that Day shall return defacto and dejure to the Gracious One. And it will be a hard Day for those who suppress the Truth
  25,27,"On that Day, the transgressor will bite his hands and say, \"Would that I had walked the Messenger's path"
  25,28,Oh would that I had never chosen such-and-such as my friend
  25,29,He made me stray away from Your Message after it had reached me. And the Satan is betrayer of mankind
  25,30,"And the Messenger will say, \"O my Lord! My people did indeed treat this Qur'aan as a thing abandoned"
  25,31,And thus did We make to every prophet an inimical front from among the sinners; but your Lord is sufficient as Guide and Support
  25,32,"Those who suppress the Truth say, \"Why was the Qur'aan not sent down to him all at once?\" We did send it down thus so that We imbue your mind therewith. And We have arranged it in good order"
