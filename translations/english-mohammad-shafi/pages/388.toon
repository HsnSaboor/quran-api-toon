  28,22,"And when he turned toward Midian, he said, \"My Lord may guide me in the right direction"
  28,23,"And when he arrived at the watering place of Midian he found there a lot of men watering their animals. And he found two women, apart from the men, holding their flocks back. He asked, \"What is the matter with you two?\" The two said, \"We cannot water our flocks till the shepherds lead theirs' away from the water. And our father is a very old man"
  28,24,"So he (Moses) watered their flock for them. Then he turned for rest under the shade and said, \"My Lord! I am in dire need of whatever good You send down to me"
  28,25,"Then one of the two women came walking bashfully to him and said, \"My father is inviting you so that he may repay you for watering our animals for us.\" Then, when Moses came to the old man and recounted his story to him, the latter said, \"Fear not! You are now safe from the wicked people"

  28,27,"He said, \"I would like to give one of these two daughters of mine in marriage to you on condition that you work for me for eight years. And then you may voluntarily extend your service to ten years; for, I would not make it hard for you. You shall find me of the righteous, Allah willing"
  28,28,"Moses said, \"That is between you and me. Whichever of the two terms I fulfil, there shall be no compulsion on me to serve more. And Allah is Guarantor over what we say"
