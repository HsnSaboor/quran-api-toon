quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,"No indeed! [Mankind shall not be left unjudged.] The record of the the wicked persons is in Sijjeen"
  83,8,And what do you understand what Sijjeen is
  83,9,It is a written record
  83,10,Woe that Day to those who had denied the Truth
  83,11,Those who had denied the Day of Judgement
  83,12,None but those transgressing with criminal intent deny it
  83,13,"When Our Verses are recited to them, they say, \"Fables of the ancient peoples"
  83,14,"No! On the contrary, what they have been earning with their own deeds has made their minds dirty"
  83,15,No indeed! On that day they shall certainly be shut out from the presence of their Lord
  83,16,And then they shall indeed suffer the blazing Fire of Hell
  83,17,"And then they will be told, \"This is what you had been denying"
  83,18,But the record of the righteous peope is in Illiyyeen
  83,19,And what do you understand what Illiyyoon is
  83,20,It is a written record
  83,21,Those closest to Allah are witnesses thereto
  83,22,The righteous people will indeed be in bliss
  83,23,"[From their seats] on couches, they will look around them"
  83,24,In their faces you shall recognise the glow of bliss
  83,25,They will be given to drink of sealed nectar
  83,26,"Sealed with [fragrance of] musk. And for this let the aspirants aspire"
  83,27,"And it will be a blend with [the waters of] Tasneem"
  83,28,A fountain from which those who are closest to Allah will drink
  83,29,Indeed those who do sinful acts laugh at the believers
  83,30,"And they [mischievously] wink at one another as they pass by them"
  83,31,"And when they go back to people of their own kind, they go back cracking jokes about them (believers)"
  83,32,"And when they see them [their own people], they tell them, \"These people [believers] have indeed gone astray"
  83,33,"And they [non-believers] are not sent as guardians over them [believers]"
  83,34,"This Day [of Judgement] then the believers will laugh at those that had been suppressing the Truth"
