quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  39,32,"Who, then, can be more wicked than he who lied against Allah and denied the Truth when it came to him? Is not in Hell an abode for those who suppress the Truth"
  39,33,"And one who came with the Truth, and one who confirmed it as true — such are the ones who practice piety"
  39,34,"For them there shall be, with their Lord, whatever they desire. That is the reward for good people"
  39,35,"[The reward of the good people is] such that Allah remits their bad deeds and compensates them well for their good deeds"
  39,36,Is Allah not sufficient for His subject? They frighten you of others besides Him. And there is none to guide the one whom Allah lets go astray
  39,37,"And one whom Allah guides, none can lead that one astray. Is not Allah Omnipotent, with power to give a fitting retribution"
  39,38,"And if you ask them `Who created the heavens and the earth?' they will surely reply `Allah.' Tell them, `What do you think, then, of those whom you pray to instead of Allah? If Allah should will to harm me, will those remove the harm inflicted by Him? Or if Allah should will to be merciful to me, will they be able to wit old His Mercy from me?' Say, \"Allah is sufficient for me. In Him should put their trust — all those who do trust"
  39,39,"Tell them, \"O my people! Do what you do, as hard as you may, I too will do what I should. You shall soon know"
  39,40,"[You shall soon know] who suffers a disgracing punishment and whom the everlasting punishment is due upon"
