quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  8,70,"O Prophet! Say to those of the captives who are in your hands, \"If Allah knows there is anything good in your hearts, He will give you better than that which has been taken away from you and He will forgive you. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  8,71,"And if they intend to be unfaithful to you, they were indeed unfaithful towards Allah before, so He gave you power over them. And Allah is Aware, Wise"
  8,72,"Those indeed who believed and migrated and struggled hard in Allah's path with their property and their lives, and those who gave shelter and help — these are awliya of one another. And as for those who believed but did not migrate, you have no responsibility of being their wali until they migrate. And if they seek aid from you in matters of religion, aid is obligatory on you except against a people between whom and you there is a treaty. And Allah sees what you do"
  8,73,"And as for those who suppress the Truth, they are the awliya of one another. If you do it not, there will be disorder on earth and great discord"
  8,74,"And as for those who believed and migrated and struggled hard in Allah's path, and those who gave shelter and help, those are the true believers. They shall have forgiveness and honourable provision"
  8,75,"And as for those who believed afterwards and migrated and struggled hard along with you, they are of you. And blood relatives are nearer to one another in Allah's Record. Allah does indeed know all things"
