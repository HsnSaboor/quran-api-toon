quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  14,11,"Their Messengers said to them, \"We are but mortals like you, but Allah bestows His favours upon whom He wills of His worshippers. And we cannot bring you any evidence except by Allah's permission. And in Allah then the believers should have trust"
  14,12,"And what reason have we that we should have no trust in Allah, when, surely, He has guided us to our paths? And we shall certainly bear your persecution with patience. And those that trust do trust in Allah"
  14,13,"And those who suppressed the Truth told their Messengers, \"We shall drive you out of our land, or you shall come back into our lifestyle.\" Their Lord then revealed to them, \"We will destroy the wicked people"
  14,14,And We shall certainly settle you in the land after them. This is for him who fears standing in My presence and who fears My warnings
  14,15,And they sought victory and every obstinate tyrant was frustrated
  14,16,"Behind him [every obstinate tyrant] is Hell waiting to quench his thirst with fetid water"
  14,17,"He will sip at it and it will not be easy for him to swallow it. And death will come to him from every quarter, but he shall not die. And further severe punishment shall await just behind him"
  14,18,Deeds of those who suppress the Truth about their Lord are like ashes on which the wind blows hard on a stormy day. They shall have no power over any thing they earn. This is far too grievous a loss of way
