quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"To Him goes back the knowledge of the Hour (the time when the present world will end and the Hereafter begin). No fruit comes out of its spathe, no female conceives or gives birth, but with His knowledge. And that Day He will call them out, \"Where are those whom you worshipped besides Me?\" They will answer, \"We confess to You none of us has seen them"
  41,48,"And those they prayed to before, will desert them. And they will realise there is no place for them to escape to"
  41,49,Man never tires of praying for good. And if evil befalls him he gives up all hope
  41,50,"And if We let him have a taste of Our mercy after some distress had afflicted him, he says, \"It was my due. I do not think the Hour will ever happen. And even if I am sent back to my Lord, there will surely still be the best for me with Him.\" We shall tell those who suppress the Truth what they used to do, and make them suffer severe punishment"
  41,51,"And when We shower Our favours upon man he keeps himself arrogantly aloof. And when anything bad happens to him, he prays a great deal"
  41,52,"Say, \"Do you see if this is from Allah and you deny it, would there be anyone more astray than he who is in such extreme rebellion"
  41,53,"We will show Our signs to them in the wide world outside and within themselves, until it becomes clear to them that it (Qur'aan) is the truth. Is it not sufficient that your Lord is Witness over all things"
  41,54,Beware! They are indeed in doubt concerning their meeting their Lord. Beware! He does indeed encompass all things
