quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and its brightness
  91,2,"And by the moon as it reflects it [brightness of the Sun]"
  91,3,"And by the day, when it displays it [brightness of the Sun]"
  91,4,"And by the night, when it veils it [brightness of the Sun]"
  91,5,And by the sky and what it constitutes
  91,6,"And by the earth and what makes it spread [prolong] its existence"
  91,7,And by the soul and what shapes it
  91,8,Then inspired it with knowledge of what is wrong for it and what is right
  91,9,"Certainly, the one who keeps it [soul] pure is successful"
  91,10,"And, certainly, the one who corrupts it is ruined"
  91,11,The people of Thamood denied the Truth by committing transgression
  91,12,"When the most wicked man among them came forward [to disobey divine directive]"
  91,13,"Allah's Messenger had then warned them about Allah's she-camel and her [allotted time of] drink"
  91,14,"But they rejected him, and crippled her. For this sin of theirs, their Lord let loose His anger upon them, and razed their dwellings to the ground"
  91,15,And He has not to be afraid of its consequences
  92,1,By the night as it veils
  92,2,And by the day as it unveils
  92,3,And by the Power that created the male and the female
  92,4,"Indeed, your [mankind's] work is in divergent fields of activity"
  92,5,"And, he who gave [things in Allah's Path] and feared Him"
  92,6,And stood firmly by what was good and right
  92,7,For him shall We make things easy
  92,8,"And he who was miserly [in giving things in Allah's Path], and considered that he needed no divine help"
  92,9,And belied what was good and right
  92,10,For him shall We make things difficult
  92,11,And his wealth shall avail him not when he drops dead
  92,12,It is certainly indeed for Us to give the guidance
  92,13,"And, certainly indeed, the Dominion over both the Hereafter and the present world is Ours"
  92,14,I then warn you of the flaming Fire
