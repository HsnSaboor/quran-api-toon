quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"And those who beieve say \"Would that divine revelation [as desired by us] is sent down!\" But now that an unambiguous revelation about war has been sent down, you [Muhammad] can see those, in whose hearts is a disease, looking at you with the look of one who is about to faint for fear of death! Far better for them woud be [continued to next Verse]"
  47,21,"[Far better for them woud be] obedience and a word of gratitude! Now that the matter is settled — [by the revelation concerning war] — it would certainly be for their good to remain true to Alah"
  47,22,"If you turn away, would you, then, spread corruption on earth, and cut asunder your ties of kinship"
  47,23,Those are the ones whom Allah has cursed! So He made them deaf and blinded their sight
  47,24,"Why do they not, then, ponder over this Qur'aan? Or are there locks upon their minds to keep it [Qur'aan] out"
  47,25,"Indeed, those [hypocrites] who turn on their backs after guidance that has been clearly given to them — the Satan prods them on, and he aids and abets them"
  47,26,"Because, they [hypocrites] say to those [unbelievers] who abhor what Allah has revealed, \"We will obey you in some matters.\" And Allah is aware of their secrets"
  47,27,"What then woud be their condition when, while the angels cause them to die, they strike at their faces and at their backs"
  47,28,"Because, they pursue what angers Allah and shun what pleases Him. And so He has made their deeds worthless"
  47,29,"Or do those, in whose hearts is a disease, think that Allah would never bring their crookedness to light"
