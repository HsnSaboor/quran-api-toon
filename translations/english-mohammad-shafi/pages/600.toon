quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,And that which was in (human) minds recovered
  100,11,"Their Lord shall have been well-aware of them, that Day"
  101,1,The Sudden Calamity
  101,2,What is the Sudden Calamity
  101,3,And what do you know what the Sudden Calamity is
  101,4,It is a Day when mankind shall be like the scattered moths
  101,5,And the mountains like fluffed up wool
  101,6,"That person, then, who weighs heavy [with good deeds] on the scales"
  101,7,"[That person] shall have a pleasant life"
  101,8,"And that person, who weighs light [because of bad deeds] on the scales"
  101,9,The Abyss then shall be his home
  101,10,"And what do you understand what it [the Abyss] is"
  101,11,A Fire intensely hot
  102,1,"The craving for more [worldly wealth and power] keeps you engrossed"
  102,2,Until you embrace the graves
  102,3,Nay! You shall soon come to know
  102,4,Nay again! You shall soon come to know
  102,5,"Nay, if you but knew with certain knowledge"
  102,6,You shall surely see the Hell
  102,7,Then you shall surely see it with eye of certitude
  102,8,"And then, on that Day, you shall surely be questioned about the bounties you enjoyed"
