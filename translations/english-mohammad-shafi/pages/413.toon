quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  31,20,"See you not that Allah has made subservient to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and that He has given you His bounties (like air and water) in abundance outwardly and inwardly? And among men is such a one as argues about Allah without knowledge, without guidance, and without the leading light a divine Book"
  31,21,"And when they are asked to follow what Allah has revealed, they say, \"Nay, we follow what we found our fathers with.\" Would they follow them even though the devil calls them to the punishment of the burning Fire"
  31,22,"And he who submits himself to Allah and is good to others, he has taken a firm hold of a strong link. And with Allah is the end of all matters"
  31,23,"And let not disbelief of one who disbelieves grieve thee. To Us is their return, and then We shall inform them of what they did. Allah does indeed know what is inside their minds"
  31,24,"We let them enjoy a little, then We shall drive them to a severe punishment"
  31,25,"And if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will say, \"Allah.\" Say, \"Praise be to Allah!\" Nay, most of them know not"
  31,26,"To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Indeed, Allah is the One self- sufficient, praised"
  31,27,"And had all the trees in the earth been pens, and the sea, after being completely used (as ink), had seven more seas to replenish it, all these would still be insufficient to cover all of Allah's words. Allah is indeed Omnipotent, Wise"
  31,28,Creation or Resurrection of you all is not but like (creation and resurrection of) a single soul. Allah does indeed listen to and see (all His creatures)
