quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,And Our Command is just one! Like the twinkling of an eye
  54,51,And We did destroy the likes of you; but is there any to take heed
  54,52,And every thing they did is in the Records
  54,53,"And everything, small and big, is duly recorded"
  54,54,The pious indeed will be among gardens and rivers
  54,55,Seated in honour near the Most Powerful King
  55,1,The Gracious One
  55,2,HE has given the knowledge of the Qur'aan
  55,3,HE has created mankind
  55,4,He has taught mankind the art and skill of communicating with one another
  55,5,"[HE has created] the sun and the moon on accurately measured dimentions, properties and positions"
  55,6,And the star and the tree prostrate
  55,7,And the sky He has raised high and set up the balance
  55,8,So that you breach not that balance
  55,9,"And weigh things correctly, and cut not the measure short"
  55,10,And He has made the earth suitable for living beings
  55,11,"Therein is fruit, and the palm tree with its sheathed clusters of dates"
  55,12,"And the grain in its husk, and the plants giving out fragrance"
  55,13,"So, which of your Lordճ Means of Power will you deny"
  55,14,"He has created mankind of clay, as [mankind make] pottery [out of it]"
  55,15,"And He has created the invisible beings [jinns] out of radiation from fire"
  55,16,"So, which of your Lordճ Means of Power will you deny"
