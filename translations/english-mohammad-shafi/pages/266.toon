quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  15,71,"He said, \"Here are my daughters, if you have to do it"
  15,72,By your life! They were wandering blindly in their intoxication
  15,73,"Then, at sunrise, the terribly rumbling sound struck them"
  15,74,"We turned the place upside down, and rained stones of baked clay upon the people"
  15,75,In this indeed are signs for those with insight
  15,76,And indeed it is located on an established road
  15,77,Indeed there is a sign in this for the believers
  15,78,And the dwellers of the wood too were most wicked
  15,79,"So We avenged them, and they are both, indeed, on an open road"
  15,80,And the dwellers of the Rock did certainly reject the Messengers
  15,81,"And We gave them Our Verses/signs, but they turned away from them"
  15,82,And they were wont to hew houses in the mountains for security
  15,83,So the terribly rumbling sound seized them in the morning
  15,84,And what they earned availed them not
  15,85,"And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them, but by due authority. And the Hour is most surely going to come. So fogive things — those that are forgivable"
  15,86,Your Lord is indeed the Knowledgeable Creator of all things
  15,87,And certainly We have given you seven of the repeated Verses and the Glorious Qur'aan
  15,88,"Pine not for that which We have given some of them to enjoy, nor grieve for them. And be kind to the believers"
  15,89,"And say, \"I am indeed the plain warner"
  15,90,It is as though what We have sent down is on those who make divisions therein
