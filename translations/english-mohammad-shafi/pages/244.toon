quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  12,70,"So when he gave them their provisions, he placed a cup in his brother's bag. Then someone cried out, \"O people of the caravan! You are most surely thieves"
  12,71,"Joseph's brothers in the caravan came forward and asked, \"What is it that you find missing"
  12,72,"Joseph's men replied, \"We find the king's cup missing, and he, who comes up with it, shall get a camel-load of extra grains.\" And Joseph added, \"I am guarantor of this"
  12,73,"Joseph's brothers said, \"By Allah! You know for certain that we have not come to make mischief in the land, and we are not thieves"
  12,74,"The men asked, \"But what should be the punishment for this, if you happen to be lying"
  12,75,"The brothers said, \"The punishment for this is that the person in whose bag it is found shall himself suffer it. Thus we do punish the wrongdoers"
  12,76,"So he (Joseph) began the search with their (his step-brothers') packs before searching the pack of his brother, and then he brought it (the king's cup) out from his brother's pack. Thus did We plan a stratagem for the sake of Joseph. He could not legally take and keep his brother with him under the king's laws, unless Allah pleased.We raise the ranks of whomsoever We please. And over every person of knowledge, there is one having better knowledge"
  12,77,"They said, \"If he has stolen, a brother of his did indeed steal before.\" And Joseph kept his secret with himself and did not disclose it to them. He said, \"You have been in a wicked state of mind and Allah knows the truth about the clarification you have given"
  12,78,"They said, \"Sir! He has a very old father; so, retain one of us in his place. We do indeed see you as a good man"
