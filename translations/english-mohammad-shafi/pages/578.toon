  75,20,"Nay, you [mankind] would rather love the fleeting present"
  75,21,And neglect the Hereafter
  75,22,Faces that day will be bright
  75,23,Looking at their Lord expectantly
  75,24,And faces that day will be despondent
  75,25,Expecting a great disaster to befall them
  75,26,Behold! When in pangs of death
  75,27,"And question raised, \"Any magician [who could save him]"
  75,28,And he thought it was the time for parting
  75,29,"And the leg was put close to the [other] leg"
  75,30,To your Lord was the direction that day
  75,31,And neither did he stand by the truth nor did he pray
  75,32,"And, on the other hand, he denied the Truth and turned his face away"
  75,33,"And then he went back to his people boasting [telling them how `bravely' he denied the Truth]"
  75,34,"[The Truth is drawing] nearer and nearer to you [O dying man]"

  76,3,"We do indeed guide him, whether he be grateful or ungrateful"
