  74,18,He did indeed think and decide
  74,19,"May he be destroyed — how [very wrongfully] did he decide"
  74,20,"Again, be he destroyed — how [very wrongfully] did he decide"
  74,21,Then he looked
  74,22,And he frowned and he glowered with intense hatred
  74,23,Then he turned back and was proud
  74,24,"Then he said, \"This is nothing but traditional magic"
  74,25,— Nothing but word of the mortal man
  74,26,Soon will I make him suffer Hell
  74,27,And what do you know what Hell is
  74,28,"Neither does it let be, nor does it let go"
  74,29,It burns the human skin so as to blacken it
  74,30,"Nineteen [angels] to guard over it [Hell]"
  74,31,"And We have appointed none but angels as Guardians of the Fire. And We have not fixed their number [], but only as a trial for those who suppress the Truth, and as a means of certainty for the People of the Book and increase in Faith for the Believers, so that no doubts are left for the People of the Book and the Believers, and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the suppressors of the Truth may say, \"What intention does Allah have by this issue [of appointing only guards for hundreds of thousands of sinners put in Hell]?\" Thus does Allah send astray whom He wills and guide whom He wills. And none but He knows [the enormity of] your Lord's forces! And this [Qur'aan] is nothing but Admonition/Reminder for mankind.h"

  74,39,Except for the people on the Right.h

  74,42,What led you into Hell
  74,43,"They will say, \"We were not among those who prayed"
  74,44,And we were not among those who fed the poor
  74,45,But we used to indulge in vain talks in company of other people
  74,46,And we used to deny the Judgment Day
  74,47,Until there came to us the Certainty
