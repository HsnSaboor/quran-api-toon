quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star when it perishes
  53,2,"Neither is your comrade [Prophet Muhammad] astray, nor has he deviated"
  53,3,And he speaks not for attaining any personal desire
  53,4,It is nothing but revelation divinely revealed
  53,5,"Imparted to him by One [Angel] mighty in power"
  53,6,"[The Angel] capable of passing [quickly from one form to another]. And he rose"
  53,7,And he was on the high horizon
  53,8,"Then he drew near, and came down"
  53,9,To be within a distance of two bow-lengths
  53,10,"And He then revealed to His devotee [Muhammad] what He revealed"
  53,11,The mind lied not what it saw
  53,12,Would you then be engaged in an argument with him over what he saw
  53,13,"And he [Muhammad] did see him [Angel] descend another time"
  53,14,"Near Sidrat [a kind of tree] at the farthest frontier"
  53,15,"Near it [Sidrat] is the Garden Abode [Paradise]"
  53,16,When what covers the Sidr covered it
  53,17,"The sight swerved not, nor did it transgress"
  53,18,He did see some of the great signs of his Lord
  53,19,See you the Lat and the`Uzza
  53,20,"And Manat, the third, besides"
  53,21,Are the males for you and for Him the females
  53,22,This then is an unfair division
  53,23,"They are but names you have given them — you and your fathers! Allah has sent no authority for them. They follow but conjecture and what they themselves desire. And, surely, the guidance from their Lord has come to them"
  53,24,"Or, is it ordained that man does [always] have what he wishes"
  53,25,To Allah then belong the Hereafter and the present
  53,26,"And how many angels are there in the heavens whose intercession shall be of no avail, unless and until it be by Allah's permission and pleasure in regard to those whom He wishes"
