quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,118,"And He pardoned the threewho were left behind, whose cases were deferred until the earth, vast though it is, became straitened unto them and their own selves became straitened to them. And they knew it for certain that there was no refuge from Allah but unto Him. Then He pardoned them that they might repent. Indeed, Allah is the One Who forgives, the One Who is Merciful"
  9,119,O you who believe! Fear Allah and be on the side of the righteous ones
  9,120,"It did not behove the inhabitants of Medina, and those around them of the Bedouins, to lag behind Allah's Messenger, nor to prefer their own selves over his. Because, no thirst, fatigue or hunger in Allah's way afflicts them, nor do they tread a path that enrages the suppressors of the Truth, nor do they attain from the enemy an attainment, but a good work is credited to their account therefor. Allah does indeed not allow the reward of good people to go waste"
  9,121,"And they spend not a spending, small or big, and they traverse not a valley, but it is credited to their account for Allah to reward them with the best of what they have done"
  9,122,"And the believers cannot move out, all of them, at one time. Then why should not a group from among every section move out to get deeper understanding of the Religion, so that they may warn their people when they come back to them to be pious"
