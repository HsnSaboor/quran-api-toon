  106,1,For the welfare of the Qurays
  106,2,"Their welfare during winter and summer journeys [of their trading caravans]"
  106,3,So let them worship the Lord of this House
  106,4,Who provided them food against hunger and security against fear
  107,1,Have you seen the one who denies that there is a just divine system in place for mankind
  107,2,Such a one it is that pushes the orphan away
  107,3,And does not motivate others on feeding the poor
  107,4,"And, woe to those who pray —"
  107,5,"Those who are neglectful of, and/or inattentive in, their Prayers"
  107,6,Those who show off
  107,7,And refuse to give even trifling things to others
  108,1,We have indeed given you the amplitude
  108,2,So pray to your Lord and offer sacrifice for Him
  108,3,Your enemy is the one to be cut off
