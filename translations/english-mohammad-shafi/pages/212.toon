quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,26,There is good — and more besides — for those who do good. And no gloom and no ignominy shall cover their faces. Those shall be the inmates of the Garden. Therein they shall abide
  10,27,"And as for those who have earned evil, the punishment for an evil is the like thereof, and ignominy shall cover them — they shall have none to protect them from Allah — as if their faces were covered with slices of the dense darkness of night. Those shall be the inmates of the Fire. Therein they shall abide"
  10,28,"And on the day We gather them all together, We will say to those who worshipped others besides Allah, \"Be there where you are — you and your gods other than Allah!\" We shall then separate them, one from another. And their gods would say, \"It was not us that you worshipped"
  10,29,"And Allah is sufficient as a witness, between us and you, that we were quite unaware of your worship"
  10,30,"There, everyone will be tried for what it did before, and they shall be brought back to Allah, their true Patron. And what they concocted shall desert them"
  10,31,"Ask them, \"Who provides for you means of sustenance from the heavens and the earth? Or Who controls the hearing and the sights? And Who brings out the living from the dead, and the dead from the living? And Who plans the affairs prudently and executes them well?\" They will reply, \"Allah.\" Then ask, \"Won't you then fear Him"
  10,32,"This then is Allah, your true Lord! And what remains there after the truth but error? How could you then be turned away from this Absolute Truth"
  10,33,"Thus is your Lord's word, that they will not believe, proved true with regard to such as defiantly disobey Allah"
