quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"Say, \"Is there any one among those whom you worship besides Allah, who can pioneer the creation and then reproduce it?\" Say, \"Allah pioneers the creation and then He reproduces it. How then are you fooled by falsehood"
  10,35,"Say, \"Is there anyone, among those whom you worship besides Allah, who guides to the truth?\" Say, \"Allah it is Who guides to the truth. Is He then Who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed, or he who himself does not go aright unless he is guided? What's the matter with you? How wrongly do you make your decisions"
  10,36,And most of them do not follow anything but conjecture. Conjecture will avail nothing indeed against the Truth. Allah is indeed aware of what they do
  10,37,"And this Qur'aan is not such as could be forged by those besides Allah. But it is a confirmation of what came before it. And it is, no doubt, the book, explained in details, from the Lord of the worlds"
  10,38,"Or do they say that he (the Prophet) has forged it? Say, \"Then bring a chapter like this and invite whom you can, besides Allah, if you are truthful"
  10,39,"Nay, they reject all that is beyond their knowledge and comprehension, as false. So did those before them. And see what happened to those wicked people"
  10,40,"And among them is he who believes in it and among them is he who does not believe in it, and your Lord knows the troublemakers"
  10,41,"And if they belie you, say, \"I am responsible for what I do and you, for what you do. You are free of any responsibility for what I do and I am free of any responsibility for what you do"
  10,42,And there are those of them who appear to be listening to you. But can you make the deaf to listen even when they cannot understand
