  12,46,"Joseph! O truthful one! Explain to us the dream in which there were seven fat cows, but seven lean cows ate them up! Besides, there were seven ears of corn that were green and other ears that were withered and dry. Explain, so that I may go back to those people and let them know"
  12,47,"Joseph explained, \"You shall sow for seven years continuously, then leave what you reap in ears, except the little that you need for immediate consumption"
  12,48,"Then there shall come thereafter seven years of hardship which shall eat away all that you would have preserved for those years, except for a little thereof"
  12,49,Then there will come after that a year in which people shall have rain and in which they shall produce wine/oil
  12,50,"And the king said, \"Bring him (Joseph) to me.\" So when the messenger came to him, he said, \"Go back to your lord and ask him about the case of the women who cut their hands. My Lord does indeed know their guile"
  12,51,"The king called for the women and asked them, \"What have you to say on the affair when you sought to seduce Joseph?\" They said, \"Glory to Allah! We knew of no evil on his part.\" And the chieftain's wife said, \"Now that the truth has come out, it was I who tried to seduce him, and he is indeed the truthful one"
  12,52,This is to let him (Joseph) know that I have not betrayed him behind his back and that Allah guides not the scheme of the betrayers
