quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,"As they [believers] look around them [seated comfortably] upon their couches [and ruminate]"
  83,36,Are not the suppressors of Truth duly requited for what they used to do
  84,1,When the sky splits asunder
  84,2,"And responds to its Lord, and it is bound [to respond]"
  84,3,And when the earth is levelled
  84,4,"And it throws out its contents, and becomes void"
  84,5,"And responds to its Lord, and it is bound [to respond]"
  84,6,"O human! You do indeed have to put in hard labour to go to your Lord, and then you meet Him"
  84,7,And as for him whose book of deeds is placed in his right hand
  84,8,He will then face his accounting with ease
  84,9,And he will turn to his own people in joy
  84,10,And as for him whose book of deeds is given to him behind his back
  84,11,"He will pray for [his own death and] destruction"
  84,12,And he will burn in blazing Fire
  84,13,"He had indeed been living happily engrossed [on earth] among people of his own kind"
  84,14,"He had indeed thought he would never return [to life]"
  84,15,Yes indeed! His Lord had kept a watch over him
  84,16,"But no! [He shall not continue to remain dead.] I swear by the afterglow of sunset"
  84,17,"And by the night, and what it veils in its darkness"
  84,18,"And by the moon, at its full"
  84,19,"You [humans] do move from stage to stage"
  84,20,"Then how come they believe not [in a life to come]"
  84,21,"And when the Qur'aan is read out to them, they prostrate not"
  84,22,"On the contrary, they who suppress the truth dny it [this divine writ]"
  84,23,And Allah knows what they keep to themselves
  84,24,"So give them the prospect of grievous suffering [in the life to come]"
  84,25,But not to those who believe and do good deeds. For them is there a reward unending
