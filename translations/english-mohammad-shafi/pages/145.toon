quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,132,And all have ranks according to what they do. And your Lord is not unaware of what they do
  6,133,"And your Lord is the Self-sufficient One, Mercy being (one od His) Attributes. If He so wills, He may destroy you, and make whom He wills successors after you, just as He raised you up from the seed of another people"
  6,134,"Indeed, that which you are promised must come to pass, and you are in no position to prevent it"
  6,135,"Say, \"O my people! You do your best and I do what I do. You will duly come to know for which of us the final abode will be. Surely, the wicked persons shall not be successful"
  6,136,"And they assign to Allah a share out of what He has created of tilth and cattle! And they arbitrarily apportion, \"This is for Allah, and this for those whom we worship besides Allah.\" Then what is apportioned for those whom they worship besides Allah, does not reach Allah. And what is apportioned for Allah, reaches those others they worship! Evil is the way they judge"
  6,137,"And thus those, other than Allah, whom they worship have made killing of their children look fair to most of the polytheists, in order to lead them to their own destruction and cause confusion in their religion. And if Allah had willed, they would not have done it. So leave them and their fabrications alone"
