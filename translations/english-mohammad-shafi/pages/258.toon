quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  14,19,Do you not see that Allah created the heavens and the earth in Truth? If He wills He will take you off and bring a new creation

  14,21,"And they shall all present themselves before Allah. Then the weak shall say to those who were proud, \"We had indeed been your followers. Would you then withstand anything of Allah's punishment from us?\" They would say, \"If Allah had guided us, we too would have guided you. It is immaterial to us now whether we bewail or be patient. There is no place for us to escape to"
  14,22,"And the Satan shall say after the Judgment is pronounced, \"Allah did indeed give you the true promise. And I gave you promises, but failed to keep them. And I had no authority over you except to call you to me, and you obeyed me! So blame me not, but blame yourselves. I cannot be of any help to you now, nor can you be of any help to me. I do indeed deny that you had worshipped me, besides Allah, before.\" For the wicked people there shall indeed be a painful punishment"
  14,23,"And those who believe and do good deeds shall be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow. They shall stay eternally therein by their Lord's leave. Their greeting therein shall be, \"Peace"
