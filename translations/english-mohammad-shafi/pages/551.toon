quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  60,12,"O Prophet! Whenever believing women come to you to pledge to you that they would worship none but Allah, and would not steal, and would not commit adultery, and would not kill their children, and would not indulge in any falsehood devised between their hands and their feet [self-devised], and would not disobey you in doing what is right, then accept their pledge of allegiance, and pray to Allah to forgive them. Allah is indeed Forgiving, Merciful"
  60,13,O you who believe! Lean not in friendship towards people who have incurred Allah's wrath! They have no hopes at all in a life to come in the Hereafter just as the suppressors of the Truth from among those in the graves have no hopes of that life
  61,1,"Everything that is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah. And He is the One Omnipotent, Wise"
  61,2,O you who believe! Why do you say what you yourself do not do
  61,3,It is a greatly hateful behaviour in the sight of Allah that you say what you yourself do not do
  61,4,"Allah does indeed love them who fight for His cause, in battle array, as if they were a solid structure"
  61,5,"And when Moses said to his people, \"O my people! Why do you cause hurt to me, when you do know that I am Allah's Messenger to you?\" So when they deviated, Allah deviated their minds. And Allah guides not the wicked people"
