  41,12,"Then He decreed it to become seven heavens in two spans of time, and ingrained in every heaven its function. And We adorned the nearest heaven with lamps (stars), and set it up as a guard (to protect the earth and life thereon). This is how the One Omnipotent, All-knowing has decreed"
  41,13,"If even then they turn away, tell them, \"I forewarn you of a thunderbolt like the one that struck (the ancient people of) AAad and Thamood"
  41,14,"When the Messengers came to them or to those who lived before or after them asking them not to worship any one but Allah, they all said, \"If our Lord had so pleased He would certainly have sent the angels down. So we do indeed reject what you are sent with"
  41,15,"So as regards AAad, they unjustly turned arrogant on earth, and said, \"Are there any people stronger than us?\" Did they not see that Allah Who created them was far greater in power than they? Yet they arrogantly denied Our signs"
  41,16,Then We let loose on them a blowing wind for several calamitous days to make them taste a disgraceful punishment here in this world. And the punishment in the Hereafter will be far more disgraceful! And they will have none to help them
  41,17,"And as regards Thamood, We did give them guidance, but they loved blindness over guidance! Then the thunderbolt of a humiliating punishment seized them because of what they earned"

  41,20,"By the time they reach it (Fire), their ears and eyes and skins would have testified to what they had done"
