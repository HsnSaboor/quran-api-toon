quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  72,1,"Say (O Muhammad), \"It is revealed to me that a group of the Jinn listened, and said, `We have heard an amazing Recital [Qur'aan]"
  72,2,"It guides towards righteousness, so we believe in it. And we do not associate anyone else, in worship, with our Lord"
  72,3,And (we affirm) that He has neither wife nor son; exalted is the Majesty of our Lord
  72,4,And that the foolish among us speak atrociously about Allah
  72,5,And that we had thought mankind and jinn would not speak lies about Allah
  72,6,"And that individuals from mankind sought protection of individuals from the jinn, and so there was an increase in their evil disposition"
  72,7,"And that they [men] thought, even as you [jinn] think, that Allah would not raise anyone from the dead"
  72,8,"And that We did certainly touch [tried to reach out to] the heaven but found it replete with guards, strong and equipped with sharp, penetrating missiles of burning flame"
  72,9,"And that we did sit on seats therein to listen. But, now, he who listens finds a flame in wait for him"
  72,10,"And that we do not understand whether ill is intended for all those on the earth, or whether their Lord intends right guidance for them"
  72,11,And that some of us are righteous and some of us are not. We have been following different ways
  72,12,"And that we do think we cannot frustate Allah on the earth, nor can we escape from Him by fleeing"
  72,13,"And that when we heard the guidance, we believed in it. And he who believes in his Lord, he fears neither loss nor any prevalence of evil"
