quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,And He it is Who created the couple of the male and the female
  53,46,"From fertilized ovum as and when [divinely] decreed.h"
  53,47,"And that He has ordained tne second life [for mankind in the Hereafter] to be obligatory upon Himself"
  53,48,And that He is the One self-sufficient and self-preserving
  53,49,And that He is the Lord of Siriush
  53,50,And that He it is Who destroyed the ancient people of AAad
  53,51,"And Thamood [another ancient people], leaving no trace of them"
  53,52,And the people of Noah before them! They were all wicked people transgressing Allah- laden bounds
  53,53,"And He destroyed the overturned cities [of the people of Lot]"
  53,54,And He covered them with what He covered.h
  53,55,"So, which of your Lordճ means of power will you doubt"
  53,56,It is a warning among the warnings of yore
  53,57,"The approaching [Hour] has drawn near"
  53,58,None other than Allah can avert it
  53,59,"Do you, then, wonder at what has been told to you here"
  53,60,Will you laugh at it and not weep
  53,61,And you remain heedlessly engrossed in merriment
  53,62,"You should [rather] prostrate to Allah, and worship Him"
  54,1,The Hour (the time when the present world will end and the Hereafter begin) has drawn near and the moon is visited
  54,2,"And if they see a sign they turn away and say, \"Another delusion"
  54,3,And they speak lies and follow their own desires. And every matter does come to a settlement
  54,4,And surely there has come to them some of the news containing lessons
  54,5,In mature wisdom; but warnings avail not
  54,6,So turn away from them on the Day when the Summoner summons to a thing forbidding
