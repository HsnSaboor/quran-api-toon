quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun is folded up
  81,2,And when the stars lose their lustre
  81,3,And when the mountains are moved
  81,4,And when the ten-months pregnant camels are abandoned
  81,5,And when the wild beasts are gathered
  81,6,And when the seas overflow
  81,7,And when the souls are rejoined (with their bodies)
  81,8,And when the girl-child buried alive shall be asked
  81,9,For what sin was she killed
  81,10,"And when the scrolls [of human deeds] are laid open"
  81,11,And when the sky is stripped off
  81,12,And the Hell stoked
  81,13,And the Paradise brought near
  81,14,Every person comes to know what he has brought along
  81,15,"No! [The misgivings of the people that do not believe in these revelations are not correct, and] I swear by the stars"
  81,16,That retreat and hide

  81,18,And the morning as it breathes
  81,19,"This is indeed the word of a noble [Angel] Messenger"

  81,21,One to be obeyed besides being trustworthy
  81,22,"And your companion [Prophet Muhammad] is not mad"
  81,23,And he did certainly see the Angel Messenger on the clear horizon
  81,24,"And he [Prophet] does not grudge (conveying what has been revealed to him) of the Unseen"
  81,25,And it is not a word of accursed Satan
  81,26,Where then are you going
  81,27,This is nothing but Good Counsel for the worlds
  81,28,For any of you who wishes to follow the Straight Way
  81,29,"And you wish not unless Allah, the Lord of the Universe, so wishes"
