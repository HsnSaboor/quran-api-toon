Remember My Favour on you and on your mother, when I supported you with the holy Spirit, you spoke to the people in the cradle and as an adult, and when I taught you the Book and the wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel, and when you made out of clay a bird-like figure by My permission, then you breathed into it and it became a bird by My permission, and you healed the blind and the leprous by My permission, and when you brought out the dead by My permission, and when I restrained the children of Israel from you as you came to them with clear signs, but those who suppressed the Truth from among them said, 'This is nothing but pure magic"
