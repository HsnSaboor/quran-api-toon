quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,6,"O you who believe! When you get up for prayer, wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads and your feet up to the ankles. And if you are unclean, then cleanse yourselves. And if you are ill or on a journey, or any of you has come from the privy, or you have had sexual contacts with women, and you find no water, simulate washing then with clean earth, and wipe your faces and your hands therewith. Allah does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to keep you clean and to complete His Favour upon you, so that you may be grateful"
  5,7,"And remember Allah's Favour upon you and His Covenant with which He bound you, when you said, \"We hear and we obey.\" And fear Allah. Indeed, Allah knows the secrets of the minds"
  5,8,"O you who believe! Be firm as just witnesses for Allah. And let not enmity and hatred for people induce you to commit the crime of being unjust. Be just! It is conducive to piety. And fear Allah! Indeed, Allah is aware of what you do"
  5,9,Allah has promised forgiveness and a great reward for those who believe and do good deeds
