quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,80,"And Allah has facilitated for you rest, security and solace in your houses. And He has facilitated for you tents.of the skins of cattle which you find light to carry when you travel and when you stay out. And of the animal wool, fur and hair, He has given you assets and possessions for a time"
  16,81,"And Allah has made for you shelters from what He has created, and places of retreat in the mountains. And He has provided for garments for you to protect you from the heat and for armour to protect you in your armed conflicts. Thus does He complete His favour upon you in order that you submit to Him"
  16,82,"And if, even then, they turn away, the responsibility on you (Prophet Muhammad) is only to deliver Allah's Message clearly to the people"
  16,83,"They are aware of Allah's favour, yet they deny it! And most of them are those who suppress the Truth"

  16,85,"And when those who are wicked experience the punishment, its severity on them shall not be decreased, nor shall they be given any respite"
  16,86,"And when those who worship others besides Allah see those others, they shall say, \"Our Lord! These are our other gods whom we prayed to besides You.\" But they will retort, \"Certainly indeed you are liars"
  16,87,And they shall tender submission to Allah on that day. And what they used to concoct shall depart from them
