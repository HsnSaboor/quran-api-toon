quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,80,Whether you ask forgiveness for them or not — and even if you ask forgiveness seventy times for them — Allah will forgive them not! That is because they suppress the Reality of Allah and His Messenger. And Allah does not guide the people who rebel against Allah's commandments
  9,81,"Those that remained back were pleased with their sitting back against Allah's Messenger and they were averse to striving in Allah's Path with their wealth and their lives. And they said, \"Do not travel in the heat.\" Say, \"The Hell fire is the most severe in heat, if only they could understand"
  9,82,They shall laugh little then and weep more as a consequence of what they earned
  9,83,"Then if Allah brings you back to any section of them and they ask your permission to go out on an expedition, say, \"Never shall you go out with me and never shall you fight an enemy with me. You were indeed content to stay put the first time, stay put now too with those who stay behind"
  9,84,"And never offer prayer for any one of them who dies, and never stand by his grave. They did indeed suppress the Reality of Allah and His Messenger. And they shall die in a state of rebellion against Allah's commandments"
  9,85,And let not their wealth and their children impress you. Allah only wishes to punish them with these in this world and to cause their souls to depart while they indulge in suppression of the Truth
  9,86,"And when a Qur'aanic Chapter is revealed, exhorting people to believe in Allah and engage themselves in righteous struggle along with His Messenger, those with means plead with you and say, \"Grant us leave to be with those who stay back"
