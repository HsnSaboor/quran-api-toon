quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  18,35,"And he entered his garden; and he was unfair to himself. He said, \"I do not think that this will ever perish"
  18,36,And I do not think the Hour will ever occur. And even if I am returned to my Lord I will certainly find there a better place than this
  18,37,"His companion answered, \"Do you deny Him Who created you from dust, then from a tiny seed of fertilized ovum and then shaped you into a man"
  18,38,"But as for me, He, Allah, is my Lord, and I do not associate anyone with my Lord"
  18,39,And why did you not say when you entered your garden that it is as Allah has willed and that there is no power but with Allah? If you see me inferior to you in wealth and children
  18,40,"Then maybe my Lord will give me something better than your garden, and send a thunderbolt from heaven on your garden so that it shall become just a barren land"
  18,41,Or its waters should sink deep into the ground so that you are unable to find it
  18,42,"And the yield of his gardens was caught in a disastrous wave of destruction. And he started wringing his hands for his investments therein, which had turned upside down. And he said, \"Alas! I should not have associated anyone with my Lord"
  18,43,"And he had no manpower to help him besides Allah, nor could he help himself"
  18,44,There! Allah is the only True Wali. He is best in giving rewards and the best to go to in the end
  18,45,And tell them that the life of this world is like water which We send down from the sky. Spring forth therewith all kinds of vegetation on the earth. Then it (vegetation) becomes dry and brittle and the winds scatter it. And Allah has the ability to do all things
