quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By the time
  103,2,"Indeed, mankind is surely in loss"
  103,3,"But not those among them who believe and do good deeds, and exhort one another to Truth, and exhort one another to patience"
  104,1,"Woe to everyone who taunts, slanders, or backbites others"
  104,2,"Who hoards wealth and keeps on counting it [avariciously]"
  104,3,Thinking his wealth will last forever for him
  104,4,Nay! He will surely be thrown into the Crushing Disaster
  104,5,And what do you know what the Crushing Disaster is
  104,6,It is the Fire kindled by Allah
  104,7,That which would ride over human minds
  104,8,It would be closing in on them from everyside
  104,9,In extended columns
  105,1,Have you not seen what your Lord did to the companions of the elephant
  105,2,Did He not bring their plan to naught
  105,3,And send upon them swarms of birds
  105,4,Pelting them with stones of baked clay
  105,5,And then making them look like chewed husk?h
