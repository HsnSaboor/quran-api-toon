quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  57,19,Those who believe in Allah and His Messengers are the truthful ones and the witnesses in the sight of their Lord. They shall have their reward and their light. But those who suppress the Truth and reject Our signs — they shall be inmates of the Hell
  57,20,"Beware! The life of this world is only a game and a pastime, a show, and mutual boasting and out-rivaling each other in riches and children. It is like the growth of vegetation after the rain, which makes the skeptic wonder, but which then withers away, turns yellow and becomes worthless stubble. And in the Hereafter, severe punishment, forgiveness from Allah and His Pleasure! And the life of this world is nothing but means of deception"
  57,21,"Vie with one another for your Lord's forgiveness and for Paradise, vast as heaven and earth and readied for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers. Such is Allah's bounty. He bestows it upon whom He wills. And Allah is the Fountainhead of the greatest bounty"
  57,22,"No affliction affects the earth or your own selves unless recorded in a Book, before We clear it. That is indeed easy for Allah"
  57,23,"So, may you not despair over what has eluded you, nor exult over what He has given you. And Allah loves not any self-conceited boaster"
  57,24,"Those [self-conceited boasters] who are miserly themselves, and urge others to be miserly! He who turns his back [from what Allah has ordained] should remember that Allah alone is self-sufficient and worthy of all praise"
