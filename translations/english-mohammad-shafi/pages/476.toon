quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,78,"And We did send Messengers before you. We have told you about some of them, and We have not told you about the others. And it was not given to any Messenger that he should bring a (miraculous) sign save by Allah's leave. Then as Allah's decree comes, every matter is judged in accordance with the Truth, and the followers of falsehood will then be lost"
  40,79,It is Allah Who has made cattle for you to ride on some of them — and you eat some of them
  40,80,"And you have in them (cattle) benefits — and to satisfy by their means a need in your minds, you are carried upon them, as upon the ship"
  40,81,"And He continues to show you His signs. Which, then, of the signs of Allah do you deny"
  40,82,"Have they not travelled on earth to see what happened to those before them? Those were more in number than them, and stronger in power and influence on the earth. But what they earned availed them not"
  40,83,And when their Messengers brought them clear evidences (of divine Presence) they exulted in the knowledge they themselves had. And the thing they mocked at besieged them
  40,84,"Then, as they saw the severity of Our punishment, they said, \"We believe in Allah, the One and Only, and reject all those whom we had worshipped besides Him"
  40,85,But their believing after seeing the severity of our punishment will be of no avail to them. This has always been Allah's law for His subjects. And then the suppressors of Truth will be doomed
