quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,The intercession of the intercessors shall be of no avail to them then
  74,49,"Then what is the matter with them that they turn away from the divine Counsel [Qur'aan]"
  74,50,As if they were scared donkeys
  74,51,Fleeing from a fierce beast
  74,52,They would rather want scrolls (of revelation) rolled out to every one of them separately
  74,53,But no! They fear not the Hereafter
  74,54,"Nay, this [Qur'aan] indeed is the divine Counsel"
  74,55,"Let any, who will, take heed"
  74,56,"And none takes heed unless Allah so wills: He is the Embodiment of the virtue of piety, and the embodiment of the virtue of forgiveness"
  75,1,"Nay, [man's negative thinking on Resurrection is not right!] I do swear by the Day of Resurrection"
  75,2,"And, nay! I do swear by the self-reproaching soul [that man's negative thinking on Resuuection is not right]"
  75,3,Does man think that We shall not be able to collect his bones
  75,4,"Yes, We have the power to restore [even] his fingertips.h"
  75,5,"But, man desires to go on doing evil in what lies ahead of him [in worldly life]"
  75,6,"He asks, \"When will the Day of Resurrection be"
  75,7,So when the sight is dazzled
  75,8,And the moon disappears
  75,9,And the sun and the moon are joined
  75,10,"Man will ask that Day, \"Where is the exit"
  75,11,No! No escape
  75,12,With your Lord that day is the journey's end
  75,13,"Man will be informed that Day what he had sent ahead and what he had left behind [undone].h"
  75,14,Man would rather be a witness against himself
  75,15,Even though he may put up excuses
  75,16,"Move not [O Prophet] your tongue with it [revelation] to make haste with it"
  75,17,Its collection and recital does indeed rest on Us
  75,18,"So when We recite it, attentively follow its recitation"
  75,19,"Then, indeed, it is for Us to make its meaning clear"
