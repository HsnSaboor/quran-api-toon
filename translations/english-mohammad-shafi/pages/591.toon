quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the sky and the Taariq
  86,2,— And what do you understand what the Taariq is
  86,3,It is the shining star —
  86,4,Not a soul but has a protector over it
  86,5,Let man then see how he is created
  86,6,"He is created by means of fluid [blood] spurting"
  86,7,Out from between the spine and the ribs
  86,8,"It [blood] is certainly indeed capable of its return"
  86,9,The Day secrets are disclosed
  86,10,"For him [man] there will then be no power, and no helper"
  86,11,"By the sky, ever returning [revolving]"
  86,12,And by the earth with its surface cracking open again and again with new growth of plants and vegetation
  86,13,"It [Qur'aan] is indeed a decisive Word"
  86,14,And it is not for just sport and amusement
  86,15,"They [suppressors of Truth] are indeed hatching a plot"
  86,16,"And I [Allah] am devising a plot"
  86,17,So let those who suppress the Truth go their way; let them go for a little while
  87,1,"Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High"
  87,2,Who created and gave the things created good shape
  87,3,"And Who determined [the span of existence for the things created] and guided them"
  87,4,"And Who brought out the verdure [on the earth]"
  87,5,And then made it into dark rubble
  87,6,We shall make you recite and then you will not forget
  87,7,Except for what Allah wills. HE knows what is manifest and what is hidden
  87,8,And We shall make things easy for you
  87,9,"Should the divine Words of the Qur'aan benefit them, do recite these to them"
  87,10,He who fears (Allah) shall take heed therefrom
  87,11,And he who is wicked will shun it
  87,12,He who will burn in the Great Fire
  87,13,"Then he will neither die in it, nor live"
  87,14,"He will surely attain salvation who keeps himself pure [in worldly life]"
  87,15,And oft-remembers his Lordճ name and then prays to Him
