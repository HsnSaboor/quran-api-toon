quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Have you, then, seen him who suppresses the Truth in Our Verses/signs and says, \"I shall certainly be given wealth and children"
  19,78,"Has he gained knowledge of the unseen, or made a pact with the Gracious Allah"
  19,79,"By no means! We write down what he says, and We will extend the duration of the punishment for him"
  19,80,"And We will inherit from him what he talks of (his wealth and his children), and he shall come to Us alone"
  19,81,"And they have taken gods, besides Allah, as sources of power for them"
  19,82,"By no means! They shall soon deny their worshipping them, and they shall be adversaries to them"
  19,83,"Do you not see that We have sent the devils against those who suppress the Truth, inciting them on in their pernicious deeds"
  19,84,So be not hasty about them. Their days are numbered
  19,85,"The Day on which We shall gather before Allah, the Gracious, groups of pious people"
  19,86,And We will drive the criminals in herds towards Hell
  19,87,"They shall have no power of intercession, unless one has struck a deal with the Gracious One"
  19,88,"And they say, \"The Gracious One has a son"
  19,89,Certainly you have come up with an atrocious thing
  19,90,"The heavens almost were torn asunder thereat, the earth was disturbed, and the mountains collapsed devastatingly"
  19,91,At that they ascribed a son to the Gracious One
  19,92,And it is inconceivable that the Gracious One could have a son
  19,93,None in the heavens and the earth but will come to the Gracious One obediently as a slave
  19,94,Certainly He has counted them and He has given everyone a number
  19,95,"And all of them will come to Him, individually, on the Day of Resurrection"
