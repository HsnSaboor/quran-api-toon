quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Ask them what thing is the weightiest in testimony? Say, \"Allah! HE is witness between you and me. And this Qur'aan has been revealed to me so that I may, therewith, warn you and warn whomsoever it reaches. Do you really bear witness that there are other gods with Allah?\" Say, \"I do not bear witness.\" Say, \"HE is the One and Only Being worthy of worship, and, indeed, I am free of the belief in those whom you set up as partners to Allah"
  6,20,Those whom We have given the Book recognize him as they recognize their sons. Those who have lost their souls — they will not believe
  6,21,"And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie about Allah or rejects His Verses/signs? Indeed, the unjust will not be successful"
  6,22,"And, one day, We shall gather them all together, then ask those who associated others with Allah, \"Where are your associates you surmised"
  6,23,"They will then be left with no excuse but to say, \"By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheists"
  6,24,"See how they would lie against their own selves, and how that which they forged would desert them"
  6,25,"And of them there are some who come to hear you, and We have put veils over their minds and deafness in their ears, so they do not understand what you tell them. And even if they see every Sign, they will not believe in it. So much so, that when they come to you to argue with you, those, who suppress the Truth, say, \"These are nothing but tales of the ealier people"
  6,26,"And they prevent others from it and they keep themselves away from it, and they destroy not but their own selves and they perceive not"
  6,27,"And if you could but see the scene when they would be held over the fire! They would then say, \"Would that we were sent back! We would not then reject the Verses/signs of our Lord and we would be of the believers"
