  26,61,"Then as the two groups of people (Moses' and Pharaoh's) came in sight of each other, Moses' people exclaimed: \"We are indeed certainly overtaken"
  26,62,"Moses said, \"No! My Lord is with me. HE will guide me"
  26,63,"We then inspired Moses to strike the sea with his staff. The sea thereupon parted, and each part appeared like a vast mountain"
  26,64,And We drew the other party (Pharaoh's people) near thereto
  26,65,And We saved Moses and all who were with him
  26,66,And then We drowned the others
  26,67,Therein indeed was a sign. And yet most of them would not believe
  26,68,"And, indeed, your Lord is certainly the One Omnipotent, Merciful"
  26,69,And recite to them the story of Abraham
  26,70,"When he asked his father and his people, \"What is it this that you worship"
  26,71,"They said, \"We worship idols, and we bow down to them in devotion"
  26,72,"Abraham asked, \"Do these hear you when you invoke them"
  26,73,Or do they give you any benefit or any harm
  26,74,"Abraham's people said, \"But we found our forefathers doing the same"
  26,75,"Abraham asked, \"Have you, then, ever considered what it is that you have been worshipping"
  26,76,You and those ancient forebears of yours
  26,77,"And, indeed, these are enemies to me, but not the Lord of the worlds"
  26,78,The Lord Who created me and Who then has guided me
  26,79,And Who gives me food and drink
  26,80,"And, when I fall ill, Who cures me"
  26,81,And Who will cause me to die and then will bring me back to life
  26,82,"And Who, I hope, will forgive me my faults on the Day of Judgment"
  26,83,"My Lord! grant me wisdom, and put me with the righteous"
