quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,7,"How can there be a treaty for the polytheists with Allah and with His Messenger except for those with whom you made a treaty at the Sacred Place of Worship? Then, as long as they are true to you, be true to them. Allah does indeed love those who fear Him and do righteous deeds"
  9,8,"And how can there be a treaty when, if they prevail against you they would not heed ties of relationship with you, or those of a covenant. They please you with their mouths while their hearts are averse. And most of them are corrupt"
  9,9,They have traded Allah's Verses/signs for a small price and then they turn people away from His Path. What they do is certainly bad
  9,10,"They do not heed ties of relationship with a believer, or those of a covenant. And these are the hostile ones"
  9,11,"Then if they repent, establish proper prayer and give charity, they are your brethren in faith. And We make the Verses/signs clear for people that are knowledgeable"
  9,12,"And if they break their terms after their covenant and taunt your religion, then fight the leading lights of the suppression of Truth — the terms are nothing to them, indeed — so that they may desist"
  9,13,"Will you not fight a people, who broke their terms of agreement and tried hard for expulsion of the Messenger and attacked you first!? Are you afraid of them? But Allah it is Who has the right to be afraid of, if you do believe"
