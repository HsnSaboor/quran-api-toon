quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  89,24,"He will say, \"Oh, would that I had provided beforehand for my life"
  89,25,On that Day no one will punish as He punishes
  89,26,and none can bind with bonds like His
  89,27,"[But to the righteous, God will say], \"O soul at peace"
  89,28,"return to your Lord, well-pleased, well-pleasing"
  89,29,Join My servants
  89,30,Enter My Paradise
  90,1,I swear by this city
  90,2,and you are dwelling in this city
  90,3,and by parent and offspring
  90,4,that We have created man into a life of toil and trial
  90,5,Does he think then that no one has power over him
  90,6,"He says, \"I have spent enormous wealth"
  90,7,Does he then think that no one sees him
  90,8,Have We not given him two eyes
  90,9,"and a tongue, and a pair of lips"
  90,10,and shown him the two paths
  90,11,But he has not attempted the ascent
  90,12,What will explain to you what the ascent is
  90,13,It is the freeing of a slave
  90,14,or the feeding in times of famine
  90,15,of an orphaned relative
  90,16,or some needy person in distress
  90,17,and to be one of those who believe and urge one another to steadfastness and compassion
  90,18,Those who do so are the people of the right hand
  90,19,"and [as for] those who are bent on denying the truth of Our revelations, they are the people of the left hand"
  90,20,and the Fire will close in on them
