quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  36,13,Recount to them the example of the people to whose town Our messengers came
  36,14,"When We sent them two messengers, they rejected them both, so We strengthened them with a third. They said, \"Truly, we have been sent to you [by God] as messengers"
  36,15,"They replied, \"You are nothing but mortal men like us and the Merciful God has not revealed anything. You are surely lying"
  36,16,"They said, \"Our Lord knows that we have been sent to you"
  36,17,And our duty is only to convey the message to you clearly
  36,18,"but they answered, \"We see an evil omen in you. If you do not stop, we shall certainly stone you, and you will suffer a painful punishment at our hands"
  36,19,"They said, \"Your evil augury be with you! Is it because you are admonished about the truth? Surely, you are a people transgressing all bounds"
  36,20,"Then, from the furthest part of the city, a man came running. He said, \"My people, follow the messengers"
  36,21,Follow those who ask no recompense of you and are rightly guided
  36,22,"Why should I not worship Him who has brought me into being, and to whom you shall all be recalled"
  36,23,"Shall I take others besides Him as gods? If the Gracious God should intend me any harm, their intercession will be of no avail, nor can they deliver me"
  36,24,In that case I should indeed be in manifest error
  36,25,"Indeed, I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me"
  36,26,"We said to him, \"Enter paradise,\" and he exclaimed: \"Would that my people knew"
  36,27,how my Lord has forgiven me and placed me among the honoured ones
