quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,60,and those who give to others what has been bestowed upon them with their hearts trembling at the thought that they must return to their Lord
  23,61,it is they who vie with one another in doing good works and shall be the foremost in doing so
  23,62,We charge no soul with more than it can bear. We have a record which clearly shows the truth and they will not be wronged
  23,63,"But their hearts are heedless of this. Moreover, there are other deeds besides this which they do"
  23,64,"But then when We seize the affluent among them, they will cry out for help"
  23,65,"Do not cry out for help this day, for surely you shall not be helped by Us"
  23,66,"My revelations were recited to you, but you turned your backs"
  23,67,"in arrogance, as if you were abandoning a story-teller"
  23,68,Have they not pondered over the word of God? Has something come to them that did not come to their forefathers
  23,69,"Or do they not recognize their Messenger, and so deny him"
  23,70,"Do they say he is possessed? Rather he has brought them the truth, but most of them are averse to the truth"
  23,71,"If truth had followed their whims and desires, heavens and earth and all that lives in them would have been brought to ruin. Rather We have brought them their Reminder. Yet they keep avoiding their Reminder"
  23,72,"Or are you asking them for any reward? But the reward of your Lord is the best, for He is the Best of Providers"
  23,73,"and, most surely, you are calling them to a straight path"
  23,74,But those who do not believe in the Hereafter have indeed deviated from that path
