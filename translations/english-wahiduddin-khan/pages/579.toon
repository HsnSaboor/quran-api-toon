  76,8,"they give food, despite their love for it, to the poor and orphans and captives"
  76,9,"saying, \"We feed you for the sake of God alone, we seek neither recompense nor thanks from you"
  76,10,"Truly, we fear from our Lord a woefully grim Day"
  76,11,"Therefore, God will ward off from them the woes of that Day, and make them find brightness and joy"
  76,12,"and their reward for being patient will be a Garden and silk [clothing]"
  76,13,"Reclining upon couches, they will find therein neither the heat of the sun nor bitter, biting cold"
  76,14,"the shading branches of trees will come down low over them, and their clusters of fruit, will hang down where they are the easiest to reach"
  76,15,Vessels of silver and goblets of pure crystal will be passed round among them
  76,16,and gleaming silver goblets which have been filled to the exact measure
  76,17,and they will be given a cup to drink flavoured with ginger
  76,18,from a flowing spring called Salsabil
  76,19,They will be attended by youths who will not age -- when you see them you will think them to be like sprinkled pearls
