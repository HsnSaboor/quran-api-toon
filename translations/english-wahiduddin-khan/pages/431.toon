  34,23,"No intercession avails with Him, except on the part of one to whom He grants permission. When their hearts are relieved of fear, they will enquire from those to whom permission is granted, \"What has your Lord said?\" They will answer, \"The truth. He is the Most High, the Supreme One"
  34,24,"Ask them, \"Who provides sustenance for you from the heavens and the earth?\" Say, \"It is God\"; either you or we are rightly guided or in manifest error"
  34,25,"Say to them, \"You will not be called to account for our sins and we shall not be called to account for what you do"
  34,26,"Tell them, \"Our Lord will gather us together; then He will judge between us with truth and justice. He is the Just Decider, the All Knowing"
  34,27,"Say to them, \"Show me those whom you have joined with Him as partners. No indeed! For He alone is God, the Mighty One, the Wise One"
  34,28,"We have sent you as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner for the whole of mankind, but most people have no knowledge"
  34,29,"They ask, \"When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are truthful"
  34,30,"Say, \"A Day has already been appointed for you which you can neither delay nor advance by a single moment"
  34,31,"Those who deny the truth say, \"We shall believe neither in this scripture nor in [any] that [came] before it.\" Could you but see when the wrongdoers will be made to stand before their Lord, casting blame on one another! Those who had been weak will say to the arrogant ones, \"Had it not been for you, we should certainly have been believers"
