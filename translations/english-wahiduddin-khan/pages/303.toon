quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  18,84,"We established him in the land, and gave him the means to achieve all things"
  18,85,He travelled on a certain road
  18,86,"until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a spring of murky water and near it he found some people. We said, \"Dhu'l-Qarnayn! You can either punish them or else you can treat them with gentleness"
  18,87,"He said, \"We shall certainly punish him who does wrong; then he shall be brought back to his Lord who will punish him with a grievous punishment"
  18,88,but whoever believes and does good works shall have a good reward and We shall facilitate his matter by Our command
  18,89,Then he followed yet another path
  18,90,"until he came to the rising-place of the sun, where he found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shelter from it"
  18,91,Thus indeed it was. We had full knowledge of him
  18,92,Then he followed still another path
  18,93,"until he came between two mountains. He found beside them a people who could scarcely understand a word [of his language]"
  18,94,"They said, \"O Dhu'l-Qarnayn! Gog and Magog are causing corruption in the land, so may we pay you tribute on condition that you set a barrier between us and them"
  18,95,"He said, \"What My Lord has given me is better [than any tribute]. Help me with a force of labourers and I will erect a barrier between you and them"
  18,96,"bring me blocks of iron.\" Then, when he had filled the gap between the mountain sides [he said], \"Now blow on the fire with your bellows.\" When the iron blocks were red with heat, he said, \"Bring me molten brass to pour on them"
  18,97,"So they [Gog and Magog] were not able to scale it, nor were they able to bore through it"
