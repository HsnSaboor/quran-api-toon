quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,give me a good name among later generations
  26,85,and make me one of the inheritors of the Garden of Bliss
  26,86,and forgive my father; for he is one of the misguided
  26,87,and do not disgrace me on the Day when all people are resurrected
  26,88,the Day when wealth and sons will be of no avail
  26,89,and when he alone will be saved who comes to God with a sound heart
  26,90,When Paradise shall be brought near to the God-fearing
  26,91,and Hell shall be revealed to the misguided
  26,92,"they will be asked, \"Where are those whom you worshipped"
  26,93,besides God? Can they help you or even help themselves
  26,94,"Then they will be thrown headlong into Hell, both they and the misguided ones"
  26,95,"and Satan's legions, all together"
  26,96,"They will dispute between themselves therein, and will say"
  26,97,We were clearly misguided
  26,98,when we made you equal with the Lord of the Universe
  26,99,It was the evildoers who led us astray
  26,100,and we have no intercessors now
  26,101,and no sincere friend
  26,102,If we could only return to the world and be among the believers
  26,103,"There is certainly a sign in that, but most of them would not believe"
  26,104,"surely, your Lord is the Mighty One, the Merciful"
  26,105,The people of Noah also rejected the messengers
  26,106,"When their brother Noah said to them, \"Will you have no fear of God"
  26,107,I am a trustworthy messenger for you
  26,108,"fear God, and obey me"
  26,109,"I ask of you no recompense for it, for my only reward is with the Lord of the Universe"
  26,110,so fear God and obey me
  26,111,"They replied, \"Are we to believe in you when your followers are but the lowest of the low"
