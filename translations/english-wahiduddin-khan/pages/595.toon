quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and its rising brightness
  91,2,and by the moon as it follows it
  91,3,and by the day as it reveals its glory
  91,4,and by the night when it draws a veil over it
  91,5,by the sky and how He built it
  91,6,and by the earth and how He spread it
  91,7,by the soul and how He formed it
  91,8,then inspired it to understand what was right and wrong for it
  91,9,He who purifies it will indeed be successful
  91,10,and he who corrupts it is sure to fail
  91,11,The Thamud tribe rejected the truth because of their arrogance
  91,12,when the most wicked man among them rose up
  91,13,"Then the messenger of God said to them, \"This is God's she-camel. Let her drink"
  91,14,"But they gave him the lie, and hamstrung the she-camel. So their Lord destroyed them for their crime and razed their city to the ground"
  91,15,He did not fear the consequences
  92,1,"By the night as it veils [the earth] in darkness"
  92,2,and by the day as it appears radiantly
  92,3,and by the creation of the male and the female
  92,4,"O men, you truly strive towards the most diverse ends"
  92,5,"As for one who gives [to others] and fears [God]"
  92,6,and believes in the truth of what is right
  92,7,We will pave his way to ease
  92,8,But as for one who is miserly and unheeding
  92,9,and rejects what is right
  92,10,We shall pave his way to hardship
  92,11,"nor will his wealth profit him when he falls [into the pit]"
  92,12,"Surely, it is for Us to provide guidance"
  92,13,and to Us belongs the Hereafter as well as the present world
  92,14,I have warned you then about a raging Fire
