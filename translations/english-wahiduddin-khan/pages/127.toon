quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,114,"Jesus, son of Mary, said, \"O God, our Lord! Send down for us a table spread with food from heaven, so that it may be a feast for us, for the first of us and for the last of us: a sign from You. Give us our sustenance, for You are the best of sustainers"
  5,115,"God replied, \"I will certainly send it down to you, but whosoever of you deny the truth thereafter will be punished with a punishment such as I have never meted out to anyone else in the world"
  5,116,"When God says, \"Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to people, \"Take me and my mother as two deities besides God\"?\" He will answer, \"Glory be to You! How could I ever say that to which I have no right? If I had ever said so, You would surely have known it. You know what is in my mind, while I do not know anything that is within Yours. You alone are the knower of unseen things"
  5,117,"I told them only what You commanded me to, \"Worship God, my Lord and your Lord.\" I was a witness to what they did as long as I remained among them, and when You took my soul, You were the watcher over them. You are the witness of all things"
  5,118,"and if You punish them, they are surely Your servants; and if You forgive them, You are surely the Mighty and Wise"
  5,119,"God will say, \"This is the Day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness. They shall forever dwell in Gardens through which rivers flow. God is pleased with them and they with Him: that is the supreme triumph"
  5,120,"The kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in them belongs to God: He has power over all things"
