quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,152,"Stay well away from an orphan's property, except with the best intentions, before he comes of age. Give full measure and weight, according to justice, We never charge a soul with more than it can bear, when you speak, observe justice, even though it concerns a close relative; and fulfil the covenants of God. That is what He has enjoined upon you so that you may take heed"
  6,153,"[He has enjoined], \"This is My straight path; so follow it, and do not follow other ways: that will lead you away from His path.\" That is what He enjoins upon you, so that you may guard yourselves"
  6,154,"Then We gave Moses the Book, completing [Our favour] to the righteous, explaining everything clearly, as guidance and mercy, so that they might believe in meeting their Lord"
  6,155,"This is a Book which We have revealed as a blessing, follow it and fear your Lord, so that you may receive mercy"
  6,156,"and not say, \"The Book was only sent down to the two groups before us and we were indeed unaware of their teachings"
  6,157,"or you may say, \"If the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely have followed its guidance better than they did.\" There has now come to you clear evidence from your Lord, and guidance and mercy. Who, then, is more unjust than one who rejects the signs of God and turns away from them? We shall requite those who turn away from Our signs with a painful punishment, for their turning away"
