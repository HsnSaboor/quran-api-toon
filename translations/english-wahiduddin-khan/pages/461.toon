quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,Anyone whose heart God has opened up to Islam possesses a light from his Lord. But woe betide those whose hearts have been hardened against the rememberance of God! Such people are in obvious error
  39,23,"God has sent down the best Message: a Scripture that is consimilar and oft-repeated: that causes the skins of those in awe of their Lord to creep. Then their skins and their hearts soften at the mention of God: such is God's guidance. He bestows it upon whoever He will; but no one can guide those whom God leaves to stray"
  39,24,"What about the one who will have only his bare face to protect him from his terrible punishment on the Day of Resurrection? The evil-doers will be told, \"Taste what you have earned"
  39,25,"Those before them also denied the truth, and the punishment fell on them from where they did not expect"
  39,26,"God gave them a taste of humiliation in the life of this world, but the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew it"
  39,27,We have set forth to men all kinds of parables in this Quran so that they may take heed
  39,28,"a Quran in Arabic, free from any ambiguity -- so that people may be mindful"
  39,29,"God sets forth a parable: there are two men -- one belonging to many masters, all disagreeing with one another, and the other belonging entirely to one master: are those two equal in comparison? Praise be to God! But most of them have no knowledge"
  39,30,You will die and they too will die
  39,31,"and, then on the Day of Resurrection you shall place your dispute before your Sustainer"
