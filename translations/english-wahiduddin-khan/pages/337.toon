quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,39,"Permission to fight is granted to those who are attacked, because they have been wronged, God indeed has the power to help them"
  22,40,"they are those who have been driven out of their homes unjustly, only because they said, \"Our Lord is God.\" If God did not repel the aggression of some people by means of others, cloisters and churches and synagogues and mosques, wherein the name of God is much invoked, would surely be destroyed. God will surely help him who helps His cause -- God is indeed powerful and mighty"
  22,41,"[They are] those who, if We established them in the land, would say their prayers regularly and pay the zakat and enjoin good and forbid evil. The final outcome of all affairs rests with God"
  22,42,"If your opponents deny you, remember that, before them, the people of Noah and the tribes of 'Ad and Thamud denied their messengers likewise"
  22,43,So did the people of Abraham and the people of Lot
  22,44,"and the inhabitants of Midian also charged their prophets with falsehood. Moses was also rejected. I gave respite to those who denied the truth, but then I seized them. Consider then, how terrible My repudiation of them was"
  22,45,"How many a town We destroyed which was given to wrongdoing, so that its roofs fell down, and how many a well is deserted and how many a lofty castle is in ruins"
  22,46,Have these people not travelled through the land to make their hearts understand and let their ears hear; the truth is that it is not the eyes that are blind but the hearts that are in the bosoms that are blinded
