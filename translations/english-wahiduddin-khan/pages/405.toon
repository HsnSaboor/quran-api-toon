  30,7,"they only know the outward appearance of the life of this world, and they are neglectful of the Hereafter"

  30,9,"Have they not travelled through the land and seen what end their predecessors met? They were mightier than them: they cultivated the earth more and built more upon it than these have ever built. Their own messengers also came to them with clear signs: God did not wrong them; they wronged themselves"

  30,15,those who believed and did good deeds will rejoice in a Garden
