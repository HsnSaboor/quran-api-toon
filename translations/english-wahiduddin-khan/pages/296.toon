quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,21,"Thus We disclosed things to them so that they might know that God's promise was true and there was no doubt about the Hour [Judgement Day]. The people argued about them among themselves. They said, \"Build a monument over them. Their Lord knows best concerning them.\" Those who prevailed in their affair said, \"Let us surely build a place of worship over them"
  18,22,"Some will say, \"They were three, the fourth was their dog,\" and others will say, \"They were five, the sixth was their dog,\" guessing at random. And yet others say, \"They were seven, the eighth was their dog.\" Say, \"My Lord knows best their number.\" Only a few know anything about them. Therefore, do not enter into controversies over them, nor seek information about them from any of them"
  18,23,"never say of anything, \"I shall certainly do this tomorrow"
  18,24,"without [adding], \"if God so wills.\" Remember your Lord whenever you might forget and say, \"I trust my Lord will guide me to that which is even nearer to the right path than this"
  18,25,"[Some say], \"They stayed in their cave three hundred years,\" and to that some have added another nine years"
  18,26,"Say, \"God knows best how long they stayed in it.\" Only God has knowledge of the unseen in the heavens and on the earth. How well He sees and how well He hears! Man has no other guardian besides Him. He allows none to share His sovereignty"
  18,27,Proclaim what has been revealed to you from your Lord's Book. None can change His words. You shall find no refuge besides Him
