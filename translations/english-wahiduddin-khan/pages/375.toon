quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,184,Fear Him who created you and those who have gone before you
  26,185,"They replied, \"You are bewitched"
  26,186,You are only a human being like ourselves. Indeed we think you are a liar
  26,187,"So cause a fragment of the sky to fall on us, if you are truthful"
  26,188,"He said, \"My Lord has full knowledge of all your actions"
  26,189,"They rejected him, and then had to suffer the punishment of a day of overshadowing gloom. That was indeed the punishment of an awful day"
  26,190,"Surely, in this is indeed a sign; but most of them would not believe"
  26,191,"your Lord is the Mighty One, the Merciful"
  26,192,This surely is a revelation from the Lord of the Universe
  26,193,the Faithful Spirit has brought it down
  26,194,"into your heart, so that you may be a warner"
  26,195,in clear Arabic speech
  26,196,"Surely, it is foretold in the ancient scriptures"
  26,197,"Is it not evidence enough for them that the learned among the Children of Israel have recognized this [as true]"
  26,198,Had We revealed it to any one of the non-Arabs
  26,199,"and he had recited it to them, they would not have believed in it"
  26,200,We have thus caused denial of truth to enter into the hearts of the sinners
  26,201,they will not believe in it until they see the grievous punishment
  26,202,It will come upon them suddenly when they are not expecting it
  26,203,"Then they will exclaim, \"Could we have some respite"
  26,204,Do they want to hasten Our punishment
  26,205,Think! If We let them enjoy life for some years
  26,206,and then the promised punishment fell upon them
