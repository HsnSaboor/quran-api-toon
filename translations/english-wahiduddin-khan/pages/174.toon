  7,179,"We created many of the jinn and mankind for hell. They have hearts they do not understand with; they have eyes they do not see with; and they have ears they do not hear with. Such people are like cattle -- no, they are even more misguided. Such are the heedless"

Say, \"Knowledge about it rests only with God, though most people do not realize it"
