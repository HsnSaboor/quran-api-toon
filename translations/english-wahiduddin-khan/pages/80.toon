quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,15,"If any of your women commit fornication, call in four male witnesses from among yourselves against them; if they testify to their guilt, confine them to the house until death releases them or until God gives them another way out"
  4,16,"If two men commit a like abomination, punish them both. If they repent and mend their ways, leave them alone. God is forgiving and merciful"
  4,17,But God undertakes to accept repentance only from those who do evil out of ignorance and those who repent soon after. God turns towards such people with mercy; He is all knowing and all wise
  4,18,"Forgiveness is not for those who continue to do evil deeds until, when death comes upon one of them, he says: \"Now I repent!\" nor from those who die as deniers of the truth. We have prepared a painful punishment for them"
  4,19,"Believers, it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will, nor should you detain them wrongfully, so that you may take away a part of what you have given them, unless they are guilty of something clearly outrageous. Live with them in accordance with what is fair and kind; if you dislike them, it may be that you dislike something which God might make a source of abundant good"
