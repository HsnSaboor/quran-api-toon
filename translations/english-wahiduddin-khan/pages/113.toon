quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,32,"That was why We laid it down for the Children of Israel that whoever killed a human being, except as a punishment for murder or for spreading corruption in the land, shall be regarded as having killed all mankind, and that whoever saved a human life shall be regarded as having saved all mankind. Our messengers came to them with clear signs, but many of them continued to commit excesses in the land"
  5,33,"Those that make war against God and His Messenger and spread disorder in the land shall be put to death or crucified or have their hands and feet cut off on alternate sides, or be banished from the country. They shall be disgraced in this world, and then severely punished in the Hereafter"
  5,34,"except for those who repent before you gain power over them: for you must know that God is forgiving and merciful"
  5,35,"Believers, fear God and seek ways to come closer to Him and strive for His cause, so that you may prosper"
  5,36,"As for those who reject Faith, if they had everything on earth, and twice as much again and offered it to ransom themselves from the torment of the Day of Resurrection, it shall not be accepted from them -- they will have a painful punishment"
