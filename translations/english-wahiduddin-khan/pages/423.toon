quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,It is not fitting for a believing man or woman to exercise any choice in his or her own affairs once God and His Messenger have reached a decision upon them. Anyone who disobeys God and His Messenger is in manifest error
  33,37,"You said to the man who had been favoured by God and by you, \"Keep your wife to yourself and have fear of God.\" You sought to hide in your heart what God wished to reveal. You were afraid of people, whereas it would have been more proper to fear God. When Zayd divorced his wife, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there should be no restriction on believers marrying the spouses of their adopted sons when they have divorced them. The commandment of God must be fulfilled"
  33,38,No blame shall be attached to the Prophet for doing what is sanctioned for him by God. This was God's way with those who went before him -- and the command of God is a decree determined
  33,39,"Those who conveyed God's messages and fear Him only: God suffices as a reckoner"
  33,40,"Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but is God's Messenger and the seal of the Prophets. God has knowledge of all things"
  33,41,"Believers, remember God often"
  33,42,Glorify Him morning and evening
  33,43,"It is He who sends blessings to you, as do His angels, so that He may bring you out of the darkness into the light. He is most merciful to the believers"
