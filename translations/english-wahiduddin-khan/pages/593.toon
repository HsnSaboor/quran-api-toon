quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the Dawn
  89,2,by the Ten Nights
  89,3,by the even and the odd
  89,4,and by the passing night
  89,5,is there not in this strong evidence for a man of sense
  89,6,Have you not heard of how your Lord dealt with the tribe of 'Ad
  89,7,"the people of Iram, the city of many pillars"
  89,8,the like of which has never been created in the land
  89,9,"and with the Thamud, who cut out [huge] rocks in the valley"
  89,10,and with Pharaoh of the stakes
  89,11,All of them committed excesses in their lands
  89,12,and caused much corruption in them
  89,13,so your Lord unleashed on them the scourge of punishment
  89,14,"for, indeed, your Sustainer is ever on the watch"
  89,15,"As for man, when his Lord tests him, through honour and blessings, he says, \"My Lord has honoured me"
  89,16,"but when He tests him by straitening his means of livelihood, he says, \"My Lord has disgraced me"
  89,17,"No indeed, but you show no kindness to the orphan"
  89,18,nor do you urge one another to feed the poor
  89,19,and you greedily devour the inheritance of the weak
  89,20,and you have a love of wealth which can never be satisfied
  89,21,No indeed! When the earth is crushed and ground to dust
  89,22,"when your Lord comes down with the angels, rank upon rank"
  89,23,"and Hell is made to appear on that Day, then man will be mindful, but what will being mindful then avail him"
