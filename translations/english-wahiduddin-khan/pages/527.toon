quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,Those who do not believe in the life to come call the angels by female names
  53,28,They have no knowledge to base this on. They merely indulge in guess-work which can never replace the truth
  53,29,So ignore those who turn away from Our revelation and seek nothing but the life of this world
  53,30,That is the ultimate extent of their knowledge. Surely your Lord knows best those who stray from His path and He knows best those who follow His guidance
  53,31,"Everything in the heavens and on the earth belongs to God and so He will requite those who do evil in accordance with their deeds and will reward those left with that which is best, for those who do good"
  53,32,"As for those who refrain from committing grave sins and indecent acts, though they may commit minor offences, your Lord is unstinting in His forgiveness. He knows you when He brings you out of the earth, and when you were embryos in the wombs of your mothers; so do not make claims to be pure. He knows best who is truly righteous"
  53,33,"Have you [Prophet] considered the man who turned away"
  53,34,"who at first gave a little, then later held back"
  53,35,"Has he knowledge of the unseen, so that he sees"
  53,36,Has he not been made acquainted with what was written in the scriptures of Moses
  53,37,And with Abraham who kept his word
  53,38,that no soul shall bear the burden of another
  53,39,and that man shall have only that for which he strives
  53,40,"and that [the fruit of] his striving shall soon be seen"
  53,41,and in the end he will be repaid for it in full
  53,42,that all things in the end shall return to God
  53,43,that it is He who brings laughter and tears
  53,44,that it is He who causes death and gives life
