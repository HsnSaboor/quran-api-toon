quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,"O my people, I do not ask you for any money for this; my reward comes only from God. I will not drive away those who believe; they shall surely meet their Lord. Yet I see that you are a people who act out of ignorance"
  11,30,"My people, who would support me against God if I were to drive them off? Will you not take heed"
  11,31,"I do not say to you that I possess God's treasures, or that I have knowledge of the unseen, or that I am an angel. Nor do I say concerning those upon whom you look with contempt, that God will not bestow any good upon them -- God knows best what is in their hearts. If I did, I would certainly be one of the wrongdoers"
  11,32,"Noah,\" they replied, \"you have argued with us, and argued to excess. Now bring down upon us what you threaten us with, if you speak the truth"

  11,34,"My advice will not benefit you, no matter how sincerely I want to advise you, if God lets you go astray. He is your Lord and you will all return to Him"
