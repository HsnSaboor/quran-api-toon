quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,"Truly, you love immediate gain"
  75,21,and neglect the Hereafter
  75,22,Some faces will be radiant on that Day
  75,23,looking towards their Lord
  75,24,and some faces will on that Day be gloomy
  75,25,dreading some great affliction
  75,26,"But when [man's soul] reaches the throat"
  75,27,"and when it is asked: \"Could any magician save him now"
  75,28,and he knows that it is the time of parting
  75,29,"when his legs are brought together [when affliction is combined with affliction]"
  75,30,on that Day he will be driven towards your Lord
  75,31,He neither believed nor prayed
  75,32,but rejected the Truth and turned away
  75,33,"Then he went off to his people, swaggering"
  75,34,"Woe to you, [O man!], yes, woe to you"
  75,35,"Again, woe to you, [O man!], yes, woe to you"
  75,36,"Does man, then, think that he is to be left to himself, to go about at will"
  75,37,Was he not once a drop of ejaculated semen
  75,38,which then became a leech-like clot; then God shaped and fashioned him in due proportion
  75,39,"fashioning out of him the two sexes, the male and the female"
  75,40,Then is He not able to bring the dead back to life
  76,1,Was there not a period of time when man was nothing worth mentioning
  76,2,We created man from a drop of mingled fluid so that We might try him; We gave him hearing and sight
  76,3,"We showed him the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful"
  76,4,"[Now,] behold, for those who deny the truth, We have prepared chains, iron collars and a blazing fire, but"
  76,5,the righteous shall drink from a cup mixed with the coolness of kafur
