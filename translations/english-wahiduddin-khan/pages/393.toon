  28,61,"Can someone to whom We have made a gracious promise and who will see it fulfilled, be compared to someone We have allowed to enjoy a worldly life, awhile, and who will be brought up [before God] for his accounting on the Day of Resurrection"
  28,62,"On that Day He will call to them, and say, \"Where are those whom you claimed to be My partners"
  28,63,"And those on whom sentence has been passed, will say, \"Our Lord, these are the ones who led us astray. We led them astray as we ourselves were led astray. We now dissociate ourselves from them before You; it was not us that they worshipped"
  28,64,"Then they will be told, \"Call upon your partners.\" And they will call upon them, but will receive no answer. They shall witness the punishment. If only they had allowed themselves to be guided"
  28,65,"On that Day God will call out to them, saying, \"What answer did you give to Our messengers"

  28,70,"He is God: there is no god but Him. All Praise is due to Him in this world and the hereafter. His is the Judgement and to Him you shall be returned"
