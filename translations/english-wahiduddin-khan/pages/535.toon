quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,they will be waited on by ageless youths
  56,18,carrying goblets and ewers and cups filled with the purest wine
  56,19,"neither causing headaches, nor intoxication"
  56,20,along with fruits of their choice
  56,21,and the meat of any bird that they may desire
  56,22,"and fair maidens with large, lustrous eyes"
  56,23,like the pearls in their shells
  56,24,shall be their recompense for their deeds
  56,25,They will not hear therein any vain or sinful talk
  56,26,only the words of peace and tranquillity
  56,27,"Those on the Right, how fortunate are those on the Right"
  56,28,They shall recline on high amidst lote trees without thorns
  56,29,and clustered bananas
  56,30,and spreading shade
  56,31,and flowing water
  56,32,and fruits in abundance
  56,33,never-ending and unrestricted
  56,34,on raised couches
  56,35,We have created maidens perfectly
  56,36,and made them virgins
  56,37,"loving companions, matching in age"
  56,38,for those on the Right
  56,39,a large group of the earlier people
  56,40,and a large group of those of later times
  56,41,"Those on the Left: how unfortunate are those on the Left"
  56,42,They will find themselves in scorching wind and scalding water
  56,43,and under the shadow of black smoke
  56,44,neither cool nor refreshing
  56,45,They had been affluent before
  56,46,and they persisted obstinately in awful sin
  56,47,"and they used to say, \"What! After we have died and become dust and bones, shall we indeed be raised up again"
  56,48,And also our forefathers
  56,49,"Say, \"Indeed, the earlier ones and the later ones"
  56,50,will indeed be gathered together at a fixed time on an appointed Day
