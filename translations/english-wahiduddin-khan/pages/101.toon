quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"The hypocrites wait to see what happens to you and, if God grants you a victory, they say, \"Were we not on your side?\" And if those who deny the truth have a share of it [victory] they say to them, \"Did we not help you win, and protect you from the believers?\" God will judge between you [all] on Resurrection Day. And never will God allow those who deny the truth to harm the believers"
  4,142,"The hypocrites seek to outwit God -- but it is He who outwits them. And when they stand up for prayer, they do so reluctantly and to be seen by others, and they hardly remember God at all"
  4,143,"They vacillate between the two, belonging neither to one side nor the other. But for him whom God allows to go astray you can never find the way for him"
  4,144,"Do not take deniers of the truth [who are at war with you] for your allies in preference to believers. Would you give God a clear proof against yourselves"
  4,145,The hypocrites shall surely be in the lowest depth of the Fire; and you will find no helper for them
  4,146,"But those who repent and mend their ways, who hold fast to God and are sincere in their worship of God will be joined with the believers; and God will bestow a great reward upon the believers"
  4,147,"Why should God punish you, if you render thanks to Him and believe in Him? God is appreciative and aware"
