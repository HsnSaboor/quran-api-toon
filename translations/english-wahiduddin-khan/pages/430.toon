  34,15,"For the people of Sheba there was a sign in their homeland: two gardens, one on the right hand and the other on the left. We said to them: \"Eat what your Lord has provided for you, and be grateful. You have a good land and a Lord most forgiving"
  34,16,"Yet they turned away [from the truth]. So We let loose on them a flood from the dam and replaced their two gardens by two others bearing bitter fruits, tamarisks, and a few lote trees"
  34,17,We requited them in that way because of their ingratitude. We requite no one in that way but the ungrateful
  34,18,"We had placed between them and the towns that We had blessed, other towns situated close to each other, and We fixed the stages [of journey] between them, saying, \"Travel between them in safety by night and day"
  34,19,"but they said, \"Our Lord! Make the stages of our journeys longer.\" Thus they wronged themselves and We made them bygone tales and scattered them throughout the land. There are certainly signs in that for everyone who is steadfast and thankful"
  34,20,"Satan was correct in his assessment of them and they all followed him, except for a band of true believers"
  34,21,but he had no authority over them; We only desired to distinguish those who believed in the Hereafter from those who were in doubt concerning it. Your Lord is watchful over all things
  34,22,"Call upon those whom you set up beside God! They possess not an atom's weight either in the heavens or on the earth, nor have they any share in either, nor has He any helpers among them"
