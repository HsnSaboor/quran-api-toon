quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,1,Alif Lam Mim
  3,2,"God! There is no deity save Him, the Living, the Sustainer"
  3,3,"He has sent down the Book to you with truth, which fulfils [the predictions] in the Scriptures that preceded it: He sent down the Torah and the Gospel"
  3,4,"in the past as guidance for mankind; He has [also] sent down the Standard by which to discern the true from the false. Surely those who deny God's signs will suffer severe punishment. God is mighty and capable of retribution"
  3,5,Nothing on earth or in the heavens is hidden from God
  3,6,"it is He who shapes you in the womb as He will. There is no deity save Him, the Mighty, the Wise One"
  3,7,"It is He who has sent down the Book to you. Some of its verses are clear and precise in meaning, they are the basis of the Book, while others are allegorical. Those with deviation in their hearts pursue the allegorical, so as to create dissension by seeking to explain it: but no one knows its meaning except God. Those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say, \"We believe in it: it is all from our Lord.\" But only the wise take heed"
  3,8,"Our Lord, do not let our hearts deviate after You have guided us. Bestow upon us Your mercy. Surely You are a Munificent Giver"
  3,9,"Our Lord, You will surely gather all mankind on the Day of whose coming there is no doubt. God never fails to fulfill His promise"
