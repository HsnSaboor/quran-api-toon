quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,90,We have revealed to them the truth. But they are certainly liars
  23,91,"God has not taken to Himself a son, nor is there any other deity besides Him; otherwise, each god would have walked away with what he had created. They would surely have tried to overcome one another. Glory be to God, above all that they ascribe to Him"
  23,92,Knower of the unseen and the visible; He is exalted above all that which they associate with Him
  23,93,"Pray, \"Lord, if you would show me that [the punishment] of which they have been warned"
  23,94,"then do not place me, Lord, with the wrongdoers"
  23,95,We certainly have the power to show you what they have been warned about
  23,96,"Repel evil with what is best, We are well aware of the things they say"
  23,97,"and say, \"My Lord, I seek refuge with You from the prompting of the devils"
  23,98,"I seek refuge with You, Lord, lest they should come near me"
  23,99,"When death comes to any of them, he says, \"My Lord, send me back"
  23,100,"so that I may do good works in the world I have left behind.\" Never! It is indeed but a meaningless word that he utters. A barrier shall stand behind such people till the Day they are raised up again"
  23,101,"When the trumpet is blown, on that Day there will be no ties of relationship between them; neither will they ask about one another"
  23,102,then those whose scales weigh heavy with good works will be successful
  23,103,But those whose scales weigh light will have ruined their souls; in Hell will they abide
  23,104,The Fire will scorch their faces and they will abide therein with their faces distorted
