quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  22,47,They ask you to hasten the punishment; God will never go back on His promise. A Day with your Lord is like a thousand years in your reckoning
  22,48,To how many a town We gave respite while it was given to wrongdoing. Then I seized it. To Me all things shall return
  22,49,"Say, \"O people, I am sent only to give you clear warning"
  22,50,Those who believe and do good deeds shall be forgiven and shall receive an honourable provision
  22,51,"Whereas those who strive against Our signs, seeking to defeat their purpose, shall be the inmates of the Fire"
  22,52,"Whenever We sent any messenger or prophet before you, and he recited anything [of Our revelation], Satan tampered with it. But God abrogates Satan's interjections and then He firmly reaffirms His revelations. God is all knowing and all wise"
  22,53,"He makes Satan's suggestions a trial for those whose hearts are diseased or hardened, and, surely, the wrongdoers are far gone in error"
  22,54,"so that those who are given knowledge may realize that this is the truth from your Lord and thus believe in it, and so that in their hearts they may humbly submit to Him. God will surely guide the faithful to a straight path"
  22,55,"Those who deny the truth will continue in doubt until the [Last] Hour suddenly comes upon them or the scourge of the woeful Day descends upon them"
