quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,35,"Those who associate [others with God] say, \"If God had so willed we would not have worshipped anything besides Him, neither we nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything without His sanction.\" So did those who went before them. The duty of the messengers is only to convey the message clearly"
  16,36,"We raised among every people a messenger who enjoined, \"Worship God alone and shun the evil one.\" Then among them were some whom God guided and among them were others who became deserving of ruin. So travel across the earth and observe what was the end of those who rejected the messengers"
  16,37,"Though you [Prophet] may be eager to guide them, God does not guide those whom He lets go astray, [because of their refusal to give a positive response to the truth]. They will have no supporters"
  16,38,"They swear their strongest oaths by God that God will never raise the dead to life -- nonetheless, it is a promise truly binding on Him, even though most people do not realize it"
  16,39,this is so that He may make clear to them what they have differed about and so that those who are bent on denying the truth may realize that they were lying
  16,40,"When We will something to happen, all that We say is, \"Be!\" and it is"
  16,41,"As for those who, after persecution, migrated from their homes for the cause of God, We will provide them with a goodly abode in this life: but truly the reward of the Hereafter will be greater, if they only knew it"
  16,42,They are the ones who are steadfast and put their trust in their Lord
