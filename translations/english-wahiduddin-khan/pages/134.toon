quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,53,"In this way We try some of them by means of others, so that they may ask, \"Are these [lowly ones] whom God has singled out for His favours from among us? Does God not know best who are the grateful ones"
  6,54,"When those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say, \"Peace be upon you. Your Lord has taken it upon Himself to be merciful. So that if any one among you does evil in ignorance and repents thereafter and makes amends, then He is most forgiving and ever merciful"
  6,55,"Thus We make plain Our signs, so that the path of the evil-doers might be laid bare"
  6,56,"Say, \"I am forbidden to worship those you call upon besides God.\" Say, \"I do not follow your whims and desires. If I did, I would go astray and cease to be rightly guided"
  6,57,"Say, \"I stand by the clear evidence from my Lord, yet you deny it. What you seek to hasten is not within my power. Judgement is for God alone. He declares the truth. He is the best of judges"
  6,58,"Say, \"If what you seek to hasten were within my power, the matter would be settled between you and me. God best knows the evil-doers"
  6,59,"He holds the keys to the unseen; none knows them but He. He has knowledge of all that land and sea contain. No leaf falls without His knowledge, nor is there a single grain in the darkness of the earth, or anything, wet or dry, but is recorded in a clear Record"
