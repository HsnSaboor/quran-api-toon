quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,Then the people of Lot rejected the messengers
  26,161,"When their brother Lot said to them, \"Will you not fear God"
  26,162,I am a trustworthy messenger to you
  26,163,so fear God and obey me
  26,164,I ask of you no recompense for this; my reward is only with the Lord of the Universe
  26,165,"Do you, of all people, approach males"
  26,166,and leave your wives whom your Lord has created for you? You are a people who transgress all bounds
  26,167,"They said, \"If you do not desist, Lot, you will surely be banished"
  26,168,"He said, \"I am one of those who abhors your ways"
  26,169,"My Lord, save me and my family from their evil doings"
  26,170,We saved him and all of his family
  26,171,except for an old woman who stayed behind
  26,172,then We totally destroyed the rest
  26,173,"and We poured a rain [of destruction] down upon them -- and how evil was the rain which fell on those who were forewarned"
  26,174,"Surely in this there is a sign: but most of them would not believe"
  26,175,"your Lord is the Mighty One, the Merciful"
  26,176,The dwellers of the forest also rejected the messengers
  26,177,"Shu'ayb said to them, \"Will you not fear God"
  26,178,I am a trustworthy messenger to you
  26,179,"so fear God, and obey me"
  26,180,I ask of you no recompense for this; my reward is only with the Lord of the Universe
  26,181,"Give full measure, and cause no loss to others"
  26,182,Weigh with correct scales
  26,183,do not defraud people of what is rightfully theirs; and do not spread corruption in the land
