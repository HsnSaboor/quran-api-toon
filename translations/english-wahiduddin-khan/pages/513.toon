quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  48,16,"Say to the desert Arabs who stayed behind, \"You shall be called against a mighty people; then shall you fight, unless they submit. Then if you prove obedient, God will grant you a good reward, but if You turn back as you did before, He will inflict on you a painful punishment"
  48,17,"the blind, the lame, and the sick will not be blamed.\" God will admit anyone who obeys Him and His Messenger to Gardens through which rivers flow. But whoever turns back shall be severely punished by Him"
  48,18,"God was pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you [Prophet] under the tree: He knew what was in their hearts and so He sent tranquillity down to them and rewarded them with a victory near at hand"
  48,19,and with many future gains -- God is mighty and wise
  48,20,"God has promised you many future gains, and He has given you these in advance; and He has restrained the hands of men from harming you, so that it may be a sign for the believers, and so that He may guide you to a straight path"
  48,21,"And there are yet other [gains] which are still beyond your grasp, [but] which God has already encompassed [for you]: for God has power over all things"
  48,22,"If those who deny the truth were to fight you, they would certainly turn their backs; then they would find neither protector nor helper"
  48,23,such was the law of God in the past; and you shall find no change in the law of God
