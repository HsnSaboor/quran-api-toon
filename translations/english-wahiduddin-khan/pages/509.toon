quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"Those who believe ask why no chapter [about fighting] has been sent down. Yet when a decisive chapter that mentions fighting is sent down, you can see the sick of heart looking at you [Prophet] as if they were under the shadow of death. Therefore, woe to them"
  47,21,"Obedience and saying what is just would become them more; when the decision is taken, it would be better for them if they acted sincerely towards God"
  47,22,"Then if you turn away, you are likely to spread corruption on the earth and sever your ties of kinship"
  47,23,"Such are those whom God has rejected, making their ears deaf and their eyes blind"
  47,24,"Will they not, then, ponder over this Quran? Or are there locks upon their hearts"
  47,25,"Surely, those who turn their backs [on this message] after guidance has been shown to them, [do it because] Satan has embellished their fancies and God gives them respite"
  47,26,"because they say to those who abhor what God has revealed, \"We will obey you in some matters.\" God knows their secrets"
  47,27,"Then how will it be when the angels take their souls, beating them on their faces and their backs"
  47,28,"because they followed the way that made God wrathful, and hated to adopt the way of His pleasure? So He made their actions come to nothing"
  47,29,Do the sick at heart imagine that God will not bring to light their malice
