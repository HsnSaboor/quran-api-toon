quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"Yet if We send a wind and they see their harvest turn yellow, they will then begin to deny [Our favours]"
  30,52,"You [Prophet] cannot make the dead hear and you cannot make the deaf hear your call when they turn their backs and leave"
  30,53,"just as you cannot lead the blind [of heart] out of their error, you cannot make anyone hear your call save those who are willing to believe in Our revelations, and thus surrender themselves to Us and are submissive to Our will"
  30,54,"God is the One who has created you in a state of weakness; then He has granted you strength following [your] weakness; later on He has given you infirmity and grey hairs in place of strength. He creates whatever He wishes; He is the All Knowing and All Powerful"
  30,55,"On the Day the Last Hour arrives, the evil-doers will swear they have not even tarried for an hour, they have always been deluded"
  30,56,"but those endowed with knowledge and faith will say, \"Indeed, you did tarry, as God ordained, till the Day of Resurrection, and this is the Day of Resurrection: but you were not aware of it"
  30,57,"So on that Day their pleas shall be of no avail, nor will they be allowed to make amends"
  30,58,"Truly, We have set forth for men in this Quran every kind of parable and indeed, if you bring them a sign, those who are bent on denying the truth are sure to say, \"You are only making false claims"
  30,59,"In this way God seals the hearts of those who do not [want to] know [the truth]"
  30,60,"so have patience [O Muhammad]! God's promise is true; let not those who will not be convinced make you discouraged"
