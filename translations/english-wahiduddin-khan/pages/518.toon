quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  50,1,Qaf. By the glorious Quran
  50,2,"Indeed, they are astonished that a warner should have come to them from among themselves. So these deniers of the truth say, \"This is indeed a strange thing"
  50,3,to come back to life after we have died and become dust? That is most improbable
  50,4,"We know very well what the earth takes away from them: We hold a book which records all things"
  50,5,"But they denied the truth when it came to them, so they are in a state of confusion"
  50,6,"Have they not observed the sky above them and marked how We have built it and adorned it, leaving no flaws in it"
  50,7,We spread out the earth and set upon it solid mountains and We brought forth from it all kinds of delightful plants
  50,8,as a lesson and reminder for every human being who turns to God
  50,9,and We have sent down from the sky blessed water with which We have brought forth gardens and grain to be harvested
  50,10,and tall palm-trees with their thickly-clustered dates
  50,11,"as a provision for human beings; and by [all] this We bring dead land to life. Such shall be the Resurrection"
  50,12,"Before them, the people of Noah and the people of Rass denied this truth; and so did the people of Thamud"
  50,13,"And the tribe of 'Ad, and Pharaoh, and the brethren of Lot"
  50,14,"and the dwellers of the Wood, and the people of Tubba': every one denied their messengers, and so My warning came true"
  50,15,Were We then worn out by the first creation? Yet they are in doubt about a second creation
