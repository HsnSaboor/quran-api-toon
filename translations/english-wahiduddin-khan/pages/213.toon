quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"Ask then, \"Can any of your partner-gods originate creation, and then reproduce it?\" Say, \"It is God who originates creation and then restores it: how then are you so misled"
  10,35,"Say, \"Does any of your partner-gods guide one to the Truth?\" Say, \"It is God who guides to the truth. Then, is He who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed or one who cannot find the way himself unless he be guided? What is the matter with you? How ill you judge"
  10,36,Most of them follow nothing but mere conjecture. But conjecture is of no use against the Truth. God is well aware of what they do
  10,37,"This Quran is not such as could have been produced by anyone but God. It fulfills that [the predictions] which came before it and gives a fuller explanation of the [earlier] Revelations. There is no doubt about it: it is from the Lord of the Universe"
  10,38,"Do they say, \"He has fabricated it?\" Say, \"Bring me one chapter like it. Call on whom you may besides God to help you, if what you say be true"
  10,39,"Indeed, they are denying something which they cannot comprehend; the reality not yet having dawned on them. Likewise those before them rejected the truth. But see what was the end of the wrongdoers"

  10,42,"Some of them appear to be listening to you; but can you make the deaf hear, incapable as they are of understanding"
