quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,Successful indeed are the believers
  23,2,those who are humble in their prayer
  23,3,those who turn away from all that is frivolous
  23,4,those who pay the zakat
  23,5,those who safeguard their chastity
  23,6,"except with their wives, and what their right hands possess -- for then they are free from blame"
  23,7,but those who seek to go beyond that are transgressors
  23,8,those who are faithful to their trusts and promises
  23,9,and those who attend to their prayers
  23,10,these are the heirs of Paradise
  23,11,they shall abide in it forever
  23,12,We created man from an essence of clay
  23,13,then We placed him as a drop of fluid in a safe place
  23,14,"then We developed that drop into a clinging form, and We developed that form into a lump of flesh, and We developed that lump into bones, and clothed the bones with flesh. Then We brought him into being as a new creation, glory be to God, the best of creators"
  23,15,after this you shall surely die
  23,16,Then you will be raised up again on the Resurrection Day
  23,17,We have created seven paths above you; We have never been unmindful of Our creation
