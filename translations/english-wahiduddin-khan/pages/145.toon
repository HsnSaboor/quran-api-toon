quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,132,For all are degrees of rank according to their deeds; your Lord is not unaware of anything they do
  6,133,"Your Lord is the self-sufficient One, the merciful. If He wills, He can take you away and replace you by anyone He pleases, just as He raised you from the offspring of other people"
  6,134,That which you are promised shall surely come to pass and you cannot prevent it
  6,135,"Say, \"O my people! Go on acting in your way; indeed I am going to act in my way; soon you will know whose end will be best in the Hereafter.\" Surely, the wrongdoers shall not prosper"
  6,136,"They set aside for God a share in what He has produced, such as crops and livestock, and they say, \"This is for God,\" so they claim!, and \"this is for our associate-gods?\" Their associate-gods' share does not reach God, whereas God's share reaches their associate-gods. How ill they judge"
  6,137,"And in like manner, their associate gods have made killing their children seem fair to many pagans, so that they may ruin them and cause confusion in their religion. Had God pleased, they would not have done so; so leave them to their false inventions"
