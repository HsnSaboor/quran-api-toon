quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,78,"But he said, \"I have been given it only because of the knowledge I possess.\" Did he not know that God had destroyed before him people who were stronger than he and possessed even greater resources? The guilty are not required to offer explanations of their sins"
  28,79,"Then he went forth before his people in all his pomp. Those who were eager for the life of this world said, \"If only we had the like of Korah's fortune! He really is a very fortunate man"
  28,80,"but those who had been given knowledge said, \"Woe to you, God's reward is better for those who believe and do good deeds: and it is awarded only to those who are steadfast"
  28,81,"Then We caused the earth to swallow up him and his home: there was no one to help him against God, nor could he defend himself"
  28,82,"Those who had coveted his position the day before now began to say, \"Ah! It is indeed God alone who gives abundantly to whom He will and sparingly to whom He pleases. Had not God been gracious to us, He would have caused us to be swallowed up also.\" Alas indeed! Those who deny the truth will never prosper"
  28,83,"As for the abode of the Hereafter, We shall assign it to those who seek neither self-aggrandisement on the earth nor corruption. The righteous shall have a blessed end"
  28,84,He who does good shall be rewarded with something better. But he who does evil shall be requited according to his deeds
