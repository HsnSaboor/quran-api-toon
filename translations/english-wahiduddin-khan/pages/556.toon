quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  64,1,All that is in the heavens and on the earth extols the glory of God. To Him belongs the Kingdom and to Him all praise is due. He has power over all things
  64,2,"It was He who created you; and some of you are those who deny this truth, and some who believe [in it]. God sees everything you do"
  64,3,He created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. He formed you and gave you the best of forms. To Him you shall all return
  64,4,He knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth. He knows all that you conceal and all that you reveal. God is aware of what is in your hearts
  64,5,Have you not heard about those who denied the truth before you and tasted the evil consequences of their conduct? They will have a painful punishment
  64,6,"That was because their messengers came to them with clear signs, but they replied, \"Shall mortals be our guides?\" And so they rejected the truth and turned away. God has no need of such people; God is self-sufficient and worthy of all praise"
  64,7,"Those who deny the truth claim that they will never be raised up again. Say, \"By my Lord, most surely you will be raised up again and then you will be told of all that you have done; and that is easy enough for God"
  64,8,"Believe then in God and His Messenger, and in the light which We have sent down. God is fully aware of all that you do"
  64,9,"When He shall gather you all for the Day of Gathering, that will be the Day of loss and gain; and whoever believes in God and does good deeds shall be forgiven their sins and admitted to Gardens through which rivers flow, where they shall dwell forever. That is the supreme triumph"
