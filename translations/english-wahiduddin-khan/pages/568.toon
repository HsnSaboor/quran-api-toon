quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,so today he has no friend here
  69,36,and the only food he has is filth
  69,37,which no one will eat except the sinners
  69,38,"But nay, I swear by all that you can see"
  69,39,as well as all that you cannot see
  69,40,"most surely, this is the word brought by a noble messenger"
  69,41,it is not the word of a poet -- how little you believe
  69,42,Nor is it the word of a soothsayer -- how little you reflect
  69,43,It is a revelation sent down by the Sustainer of the Universe
  69,44,if he had invented any lies about Us
  69,45,We would indeed have seized him by his right hand
  69,46,and would indeed have cut his life-vein
  69,47,and none of you could have held Us off from him
  69,48,And surely it is an admonition to the God-fearing
  69,49,We know very well that there are some among you who reject Our signs
  69,50,it will be a source of bitter regret for those who deny the truth
  69,51,it is the indubitable truth
  69,52,"So glorify the name of your Lord, the Almighty"
  70,1,A doubter once demanded that punishment be immediately meted out
  70,2,to those who deny the truth. No power can hinder God
  70,3,from punishing them. He is the Lord of the Ascending Stairways
  70,4,by which the angels and the Spirit will ascend to Him in one Day which will last for fifty thousand years
  70,5,"Therefore, [O believers] behave with seemly patience"
  70,6,"They see it [the Day of Judgement] to be far off"
  70,7,but We see it near at hand
  70,8,On that Day the heavens shall become like molten brass
  70,9,and the mountains will become like tufts of wool
  70,10,and no friend will ask about his friend
