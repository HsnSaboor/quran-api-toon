quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  8,70,"Prophet, tell those you have taken captive: \"If God knows of any good in your hearts, He will give you something better than what has been taken from you, and He will forgive you: God is Forgiving and Merciful"
  8,71,"And if they would betray you, they betrayed God before, and He gave [you] power over them. God is aware and wise"
  8,72,"Those who have believed and migrated and struggled for God's cause with their possessions and persons, and those who have given refuge and help, are the friends and protectors of one another. But as for those who have come to believe without having migrated -- you are in no way responsible for their protection until they migrate. If they seek your help in the matter of religion, it is incumbent on you to help them, except against a people with whom you have a pact. God sees what you do"
  8,73,"Those who deny the truth support one another. If you fail to do likewise, there will be great disorder and corruption in the land"
  8,74,"Those who have believed and migrated and striven for the cause of God, as well as those who have given them refuge and support, are the true believers; they shall have forgiveness and an honourable provision"
  8,75,"And those who have believed later on, and emigrated and struggled for God's sake alongside you are also a part of you. But as to blood relations, they are nearer one to another in the Book of God. God has full knowledge of all things"
