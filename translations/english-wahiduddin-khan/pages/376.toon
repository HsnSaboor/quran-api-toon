quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,of what avail would their past enjoyment be to them
  26,208,Never have We destroyed a town without sending down messengers to warn it
  26,209,"as a reminder from Us: We are never unjust"
  26,210,It was not the devils who brought down the Quran
  26,211,"neither are they worthy of it, nor are they capable of it"
  26,212,indeed they are debarred from overhearing it
  26,213,"So do not call on any deity besides God, lest you incur His punishment"
  26,214,Warn your nearest kinsmen
  26,215,and extend kindness and affection to those of the believers who follow you
  26,216,"If they disobey you, say, \"I bear no responsibility for what you do"
  26,217,"Put your trust in the Mighty One, the Merciful"
  26,218,"who sees you when you stand up [for prayer]"
  26,219,and sees your movements among those who prostrate themselves
  26,220,"He is the All Hearing, the All Knowing"
  26,221,Shall I tell you upon whom the devils descend
  26,222,They descend on every lying sinner
  26,223,"who lends an ear to them, and most of them are liars"
  26,224,And as for the poets -- it is the misled who follow them
  26,225,Do you not see how they wander aimlessly in every valley
  26,226,preaching what they do not practice
  26,227,Not so the true believers who do good works and remember God with fervour and defend themselves only after they are wronged. The wrongdoers will soon know how evil a turn their affairs will take
