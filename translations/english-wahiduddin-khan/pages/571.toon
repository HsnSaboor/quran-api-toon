quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  71,11,He will send down abundant rain from the sky for you
  71,12,increase your wealth and sons; and grant you gardens and waterways
  71,13,What is the matter with you that you deny the greatness of God
  71,14,when He has created you through different stages of existence
  71,15,Do you not see how God has created the seven heavens one above another
  71,16,"and made the moon therein a light, and made the sun a lamp"
  71,17,how God has produced you from the earth and caused you to grow
  71,18,how He will then return you to it and bring you forth again
  71,19,how God has spread the earth out for you
  71,20,so that you may walk along its spacious paths
  71,21,"Noah supplicated, \"Lord, they have disobeyed me, and followed those whose wealth and children have only added to their ruin"
  71,22,and they have hatched a mighty plot
  71,23,"and they said [to their followers], \"Do not ever abandon your deities: abandon neither Wadd, nor Suwa', and neither Yaghuth, nor Yauq nor Nasr"
  71,24,They have led many astray; so lead the wrongdoers to further error
  71,25,They were drowned and sent to Hell for their misdeeds; they found no one to help them against God
  71,26,"Noah prayed, \"O my Lord! Do not leave on earth a single one of those who deny the truth"

  71,28,"Lord! Forgive me and my parents and every true believer who enters my house, forgive all the believing men and believing women; and bestow no increase upon the wrongdoers except in ruin"
