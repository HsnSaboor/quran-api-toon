quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When the sky is cleft asunder
  82,2,and when the stars are scattered
  82,3,when the seas overflow
  82,4,and when the graves are laid open
  82,5,"then everyone will know what he has sent ahead, and what he has left behind"
  82,6,O man! What is it that lures you away from your bountiful Sustainer
  82,7,"who created you, fashioned you and proportioned you"
  82,8,in whatever form He pleased
  82,9,Yet you deny the Last Judgement
  82,10,"Surely, there are guardians watching over you"
  82,11,noble recorders
  82,12,who know all that you do
  82,13,the virtuous will dwell in bliss
  82,14,whereas the wicked will be in Hell
  82,15,which they shall enter on the Day of Judgement
  82,16,and from which they will find no escape
  82,17,What will make you realize what the Day of Judgement will be
  82,18,"Again: what will make you realize what the Day of Judgement will be"
  82,19,"It will be a Day when no human being shall be of the least avail to any other human being, God [alone] will hold command on that Day"
  83,1,Woe to those who give short measure
  83,2,who demand of other people full measure for themselves
  83,3,"but when they give by measurement or weight to others, they give them less"
  83,4,Do such people not realize that they will be raised up
  83,5,on a fateful Day
  83,6,The Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the Universe
