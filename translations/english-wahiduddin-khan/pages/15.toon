  2,97,"Say, \"Anyone who is an enemy of Gabriel, who by God's leave has brought down to your heart [the Quran] fulfilling that [predictions about the last prophet in the earlier revelations] which precedes it, and is a guidance and good news for the faithful"
  2,98,"whoever is an enemy of God, His angels, or His messengers, or of Gabriel or Michael, will surely find that God too is the enemy of those who deny the truth"
  2,99,We have sent down clear signs to you and no one will reject them except the wicked
  2,100,"Why is it that, whenever they make a covenant, some of them cast it aside? Most of them do not believe"
  2,101,"Whenever a messenger from God has come to them, fulfilling that [predictions] which they already had, some of those to whom the Book was given have cast off the Book of God behind their backs as if they had no knowledge"
