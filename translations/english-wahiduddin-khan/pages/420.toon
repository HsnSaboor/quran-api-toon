  33,17,"Say, \"Who is there to shield you from God if He wishes to harm you? If God wishes to show you mercy, who can prevent Him.\" Besides God they shall find none to protect them, and none to bring them succour"
  33,18,"God knows exactly who among you hold the others back, who say to their brethren, \"Come over to our side,\" and they seldom take part in the fighting"
  33,19,"Begrudging you all help, but when danger comes, you can see them looking at you with rolling eyes as if in their death throes; but once their fear has passed, they come to you and do glib-talking in their greed for wealth.

  33,21,"You have indeed in the Prophet of God a good example for those of you who look to God and the Last Day, and remember God always"
  33,22,"When the believers saw the confederates, they said, \"This is what God and His Messenger have promised us. Surely the promise of God and His Messenger has come true.\" It served to increase them in faith and submission"
