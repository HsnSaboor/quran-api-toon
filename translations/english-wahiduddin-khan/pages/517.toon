  49,12,"Believers, avoid much suspicion. Indeed some suspicion is a sin. And do not spy on one another and do not backbite. Would any of you like to eat his dead brother's flesh? No, you would hate it. Fear God, God is ever forgiving and most merciful"
  49,13,"Mankind! We have created you from a male and female, and made you into peoples and tribes, so that you might come to know each other. The noblest of you in God's sight is the one who fears God most. God is all knowing and all-aware"
  49,14,"The Arabs of the desert say, \"We have believed.\" Say to them, \"You have not believed yet; say rather, \"We have submitted,\" for faith has not yet entered into your hearts. But if you will obey God and His Messenger, He will not detract anything from your good deeds. God is most forgiving and ever merciful"
  49,15,"The believers are only those who have faith in God and His Messenger and then doubt not, but strive, hard with their wealth and their persons for the cause of God. Such are the truthful ones"
  49,16,"Say, \"Do you presume to teach God your religion when God knows everything in the heavens and earth? God has knowledge of all things"
  49,17,"They think they have done you a favour by becoming Muslims! Say, \"Do not consider your Islam a favour to me. No indeed! It is God who bestowed a favour on you by guiding you to the true faith. [Admit this], if you are telling the truth"
  49,18,God knows the unseen things of the heavens and the earth. God sees all that you do
