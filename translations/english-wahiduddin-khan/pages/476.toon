quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,78,"Before your time We sent other messengers: of them there are some whose story We have related to you, and some whose story We have not related to you. It was not [possible] for any messenger to bring a sign except by the leave of God: but when the command of God was issued, the matter was decided in truth and justice. There and then, those who stood on falsehoods perished"
  40,79,"It is God who provides livestock for you, some for riding and some for your food"
  40,80,"you have other benefits in them too. You can reach any destination you wish on them: they carry you by land, as ships carry you on the sea"
  40,81,He shows you His signs; which then of the signs of God will you deny
  40,82,Have they not travelled in the land to see the fate of those who went before them? They were more numerous and mightier and left greater traces of their power on the earth; yet all that they accomplished was of no avail to them
  40,83,"When messengers came to them with clear signs, they revelled in whatever knowledge they had, and so they were engulfed by the very punishment they mocked"
  40,84,"but when they saw Our punishment, they said, \"We believe in God, the One God, and we reject the partners we used to associate with Him"
  40,85,"but believing after seeing Our punishment did not benefit them at all: this is the law of God to deal with His creatures, and thus the disbelievers were the losers"
