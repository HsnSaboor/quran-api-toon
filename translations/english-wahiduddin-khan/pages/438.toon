quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  35,31,The Book which We have revealed to you is the truth confirming previous scriptures. God knows and observes His servants
  35,32,"We have bestowed the Book on those of Our servants whom We have chosen. Some wrong their own souls, some keep half-way [between right and wrong]; some, by God's leave, excel others in good deeds. This is a great bounty of God"
  35,33,"they shall enter the Gardens of Eternity, where they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and wear silk garments"
  35,34,"They will say, \"Praise be to God who has taken away all sorrow from us. Our Lord is forgiving and appreciative"
  35,35,"Through His grace He has admitted us to the everlasting Abode, where neither toil nor weariness affects us"
  35,36,"Those who deny the truth shall remain in the fire of Hell. Death will not be decreed for them, so that they could escape by way of death, nor will its torment ever be eased for them. Thus do We requite every ungrateful person"
  35,37,"There they will cry out, \"Lord, take us out! We shall do good deeds, and behave differently from the way we used to.\" But He will answer, \"Did We not make your life long enough to take warning if you were going to? The warner did come to you. So now have a taste of the punishment.\" Wrongdoers will have no supporter"
  35,38,God knows the hidden reality of the heavens and the earth. He has full knowledge of what is in the hearts of men
