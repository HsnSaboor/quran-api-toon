quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  14,11,"Their messengers replied, \"We are indeed mortals like yourselves. But God bestows His grace on such of His servants as He chooses. We cannot give you miracles, except by God's leave. In God let true believers put their trust"
  14,12,"and why should we not put our trust in God when He has already guided us to our paths? We will, surely, bear with patience all the harm you do us. So in God let those who trust put their trust"
  14,13,"Those who deny the truth said to their messengers, \"We shall banish you from our land unless you return to our ways.\" But their Lord inspired the messengers, saying, \"We shall destroy the evil-doers"
  14,14,"and settle you on the land to succeed them. That is [in store] for anyone who is in awe of meeting Me, and who heeds My warnings"
  14,15,"When they sought Our Judgement, every stubborn oppressor was frustrated"
  14,16,"Beyond him is Hell, and he shall drink putrid water"
  14,17,"he will sip and will not find it easy to swallow it. Death will approach him from every quarter, yet he will not die. More intense suffering will lie ahead of him"
  14,18,"The works of those who deny their Lord are like ashes which the wind scatters on a stormy day: they shall gain nothing from what they do. To act thus is to stray far into error"
