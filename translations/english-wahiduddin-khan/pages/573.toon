quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,Some of us are obedient while others are wrongdoers; it is the obedient who have found the right path
  72,15,but those who are wrongdoers will become the fuel of Hell
  72,16,"If they had followed the right path, We would have provided them with abundant rain"
  72,17,so that We may test them by it -- whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord shall be sternly punished
  72,18,The mosques are for God's worship -- so do not invoke anyone else along with God
  72,19,"when God's servant stood up to pray to Him, they pressed close to him in great numbers, almost stifling him"
  72,20,"Say, \"I call only upon my Lord and do not associate anyone else with Him"
  72,21,"Say, \"It is not in my power to cause you either harm or good"
  72,22,"Say, \"Surely no one can protect me against God, nor can I find besides Him any place of refuge"
  72,23,"My duty is only to convey that which I receive from Him and His messages.\" For those who disobey God and His Messenger there is the fire of hell, wherein they will abide forever"
  72,24,"When they are confronted by what they have been promised, they will realize who is weaker in helpers and fewer in numbers"
  72,25,"Say, \"I do not know whether what you are promised is imminent, or whether my Lord has set for it a far-off day"
  72,26,He alone has knowledge of what is hidden. He reveals this to none
  72,27,except the messenger whom He has chosen. He sends down guardians who walk before them and behind them
  72,28,so that He may know that the messengers have delivered the messages of their Lord. He encompasses all that is with them and He keeps count of all things
