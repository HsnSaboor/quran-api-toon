quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the setting star
  53,2,your companion has neither strayed nor is he misguided
  53,3,nor does he speak out of his own desire
  53,4,"It [the Quran] is nothing but revelation sent down to him"
  53,5,"He was taught by [an angel] who is mighty in power"
  53,6,and endowed with wisdom; who in time manifested himself
  53,7,standing poised at the highest point on the horizon
  53,8,then came down close
  53,9,until he was two bow-lengths away or even closer
  53,10,and revealed to God's servant what he revealed
  53,11,"The heart [of the Prophet] did not misconstrue what he saw"
  53,12,Will you then dispute with him as to what he saw
  53,13,And certainly he saw him descend a second time
  53,14,by the lote tree beyond which none may pass
  53,15,"by the Garden of [Eternal] Repose"
  53,16,when the lote tree was covered in mystic splendour
  53,17,His sight did not waver nor was it unduly bold
  53,18,He saw some of the greatest signs of his Lord
  53,19,"Have you really considered al-Lat and al-\"Uzza"
  53,20,"and the third one, Manat"
  53,21,What! For you the males and for Him the females
  53,22,That indeed is an unfair division
  53,23,"these are nothing but names which you yourselves have devised, you and your forefathers. God has sent down no authority for them. They follow nothing but conjecture and what their own selves desire, even though guidance has already come to them from their Lord"
  53,24,Shall man have whatever he craves
  53,25,But it is to God that the Hereafter and this world belong
  53,26,"There may be countless angels in heaven, but their intercession will be of no avail until God has given permission to those whom he chooses and accepts"
