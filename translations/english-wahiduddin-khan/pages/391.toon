  28,47,"and may not say, if an affliction should befall them on account of their misdeeds: \"Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we might have followed Your message and become believers"
  28,48,"But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, \"Why has he not been given the like of what Moses was given?\" But did they not reject what Moses was given before?
