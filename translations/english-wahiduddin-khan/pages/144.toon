quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,125,"When God desires to guide someone, He opens his breast to Islam; and whoever He wills to let go astray, He causes his breast to be constricted as if he had to climb up to the skies. That is how God heaps ignominy upon those who refuse to believe"
  6,126,This is the straight path leading to your Lord. We have made the signs clear for thinking men
  6,127,They shall dwell in the Home of Peace with their Lord; He will be their Protector as a recompense for what they have been doing
  6,128,"On the day when He gathers them all together, He will say, \"Company of jinn, you took away many followers among mankind.\" And their adherents among mankind will say, \"Our Lord, we benefited from one another, but now we have reached the end of the term which You determined for us.\" He will say, \"The Fire shall be your home, and there you shall remain forever, except as God wills. Surely your Lord is wise and all knowing"
  6,129,And in like manner We shall keep the wrongdoers close to others as a punishment for their misdeeds
  6,130,"Company of jinn and mankind! Did messengers not come from among you to recite My revelations to you, and warn you of the meeting of this Day?\" They will say, \"We bear witness against ourselves.\" It was the life of this world that deceived them and so they will bear witness against themselves, that they rejected the truth"
  6,131,"Your Lord would not destroy a community for its wrongdoing, so long as its people were still unaware"
