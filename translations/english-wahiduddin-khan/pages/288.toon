quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,59,"Nothing has prevented Us from sending signs, except the fact that previous peoples denied them. We gave the people of Thamud the she-camel as a clear sign, yet they mistreated her. We give signs only by way of warning"
  17,60,"We told you that your Lord encompasses mankind. We granted the vision which We showed you, as well as the tree that is cursed in the Quran, only as a test for mankind. We warn them, but this only increases their insolence"
  17,61,"When We said to the angels, \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam,\" they all prostrated themselves except Iblis. He said, \"Am I to prostrate myself to someone You have created out of clay"
  17,62,"and [further] said, \"Do you see this being whom You have exalted above me? If You reprieve me until the Day of Resurrection, I will bring all but a few of his descendents under my sway"
  17,63,"God said, \"Go away! Hell will be your reward and the reward of any of them who follow you -- an ample recompense"
  17,64,"Go ahead and entice whomsoever of them you can, with your voice, and mount assaults against them with your cavalry and infantry and be their partner in wealth and offspring, and make promises to them, Satan promises nothing but delusion"
  17,65,but over My true servants you shall have no power. Your Lord will be their all-sufficient guardian
  17,66,"Your Lord is He who causes the ships to move onward for you across the sea, so that you may go in quest of His bounty: He is most merciful towards you"
