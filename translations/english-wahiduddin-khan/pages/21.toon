quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,135,"They say, \"Be Jews or Christians, and you shall be rightly guided.\" Say, \"By no means! We believe in the faith of Abraham, who was ever inclined [to God]; he was not one of those who set up partners with God"
  2,136,"Say, \"We believe in God and what was revealed to us; and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendants, and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the [other] prophets by their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them. It is to Him that we surrender ourselves"
  2,137,"If they believe as you have believed, then are they rightly guided; but if they turn back, then know that they are entrenched in hostility. God will surely suffice to defend you against them, for He is All Hearing, All Knowing"
  2,138,We take on God's own dye. Who has a better dye than God's? We worship Him alone
  2,139,"Say, \"Do you dispute with us about God, while He is our Lord and your Lord? We have our actions and you have your actions. We are devoted to Him alone"
  2,140,"Do you claim that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their descendants were all Jews or Christians?\" Say, \"Do you know better or does God? And who could be more unjust than one who conceals a testimony given to him by God? God is not unaware of what you do"
  2,141,Those were a people that have passed away; theirs is what they did and yours what you have done. You shall not be answerable for their deeds
