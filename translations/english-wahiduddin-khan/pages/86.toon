quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,45,"God is quite aware as to who your enemies are; God suffices as a patron, and God suffices as a supporter"
  4,46,"Some Jews take words out of their context and say, \"We have heard, but we disobey,\" or \"Hear without listening.\" And they say \"Look at us,\" twisting the phrase with their tongues so as to disparage religion. But if they had said, \"We hear and we obey,\" and \"Listen to us and look at us with favour,\" that would have been better and more proper for them. God has rejected them for their defiance so that they shall not believe, except a few of them"
  4,47,"O People of the Book, believe in what We have sent down, fulfilling [the predictions] that is with you, before We destroy [your sense of] direction, so as to confound or reject you, as We rejected those who broke the Sabbath: God's command is always carried out"
  4,48,"God will not forgive anyone for associating something with Him, while He will forgive whoever He wishes for anything besides that. Whoever ascribes partners to God is guilty of a monstrous sin"
  4,49,Have you not seen those who consider themselves pure? It is indeed God who purifies whoever He pleases and none shall be wronged by as much as a hair's breadth
  4,50,See how they attribute their own lying inventions to God. This is in itself a flagrant sin
  4,51,"Have you not seen those who were in possession of a portion of the Book? They believe in idols and devils. They say of those who deny the truth, \"They are more rightly guided than the believers"
