quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,88,"The arrogant leaders of his people said, \"Shu'ayb, we will expel you and your fellow believers from our town unless you return to our faith.\" He said, \"Even though we detest it"
  7,89,"We would be inventing lies against God if we returned to your faith after God has delivered us from it. It is not for us to return to it unless God our Lord so willed. Our Lord encompasses all things in His knowledge. We have put our trust in God. Our Lord, expose the truth [and judge] between us and our people, You are the best judge"
  7,90,"The leading men of his people who were bent on denying the truth, said, \"If you follow Shu'ayb, you will certainly be the losers"
  7,91,Thereupon an earthquake overtook them and morning found them lying flattened in their homes
  7,92,"those who had denied Shu'ayb became as though they had never lived there. Those who denied Shu'ayb, were themselves the losers"
  7,93,"So he turned away from them, saying, \"My people, I delivered my Lord's messages to you and gave you sincere advice, so why should I grieve for people who refused to believe"
  7,94,"Whenever We sent a prophet to a town, We afflicted its people with suffering and adversity, so that they might humble themselves [before God]"
  7,95,"and then We changed their hardship into ease until they grew affluent and said, \"Our fathers had also experienced adversity and prosperity,\" then We seized them suddenly, unawares"
