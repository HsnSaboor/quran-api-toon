quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  60,12,"O Prophet! When believing women come to you and pledge themselves not to associate in worship any other thing with God, not to steal or commit adultery or kill their children or indulge in slander, intentionally inventing falsehoods, and not to disobey you in that which is right, then accept their pledge of allegiance and pray to God to forgive them their sins, for God is forgiving and merciful"
  60,13,"Believers! Do not make friends with those who have incurred the wrath of God. Such men are indeed bereft of all hope of a life to come, just as those who deny the truth lying in their graves are bereft of all hopes"
  61,1,"Everything in the heavens and earth glorifies God -- He is the Almighty, the Wise"
  61,2,Believers! Why do you say one thing and do another
  61,3,It is most hateful to God that you do not practise what you preach
  61,4,"surely, God loves those who fight for His cause in ranks, as if they were a solid cemented structure"
  61,5,"Remember when Moses said to his people, \"O my people, why do you cause me grief when you know that I am God's Messenger to you?\" When they wavered, God let their hearts waver too. God does not guide transgressors"
