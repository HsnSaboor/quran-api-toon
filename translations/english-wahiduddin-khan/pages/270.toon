  16,27,"Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them, and say, \"Where are My partners for whose sake you opposed [My guidance]?\" Those given knowledge will say, \"This Day humiliation and affliction will surely befall those who have been denying the truth"
  16,28,"Those whose lives the angels take while they are wronging their own souls will offer submission saying, \"We were not doing anything evil!\" \"Indeed!\" the angels will reply, \"God is aware of what you have been doing"
  16,29,"so enter the gates of Hell. There you shall abide forever.\" Evil indeed is the abode of the arrogant"
  16,30,"When those who fear God are asked, \"What has your Lord sent down?\" Their reply is, \"Goodness!\" The reward of those who do good works in this world is good, but the abode of the Hereafter is even better. The home of the righteous is indeed excellent"
  16,31,"They will enter Gardens of Eternity, where rivers will flow at their feet. There they will have all that they wish for. Thus God rewards the righteous"
  16,32,"those whose lives the angels take in a state of purity, saying [to them], \"Peace be on you; enter the Garden, because of [the good] which you did [in the world]"
  16,33,"Are they waiting for the angels to come to them, or the fulfillment of your Lord's will? Those who went before them did the same. God did not wrong them; rather they wronged themselves"
  16,34,"The evil results of their deeds overtook them, and that which they used to mock at encompassed them"
