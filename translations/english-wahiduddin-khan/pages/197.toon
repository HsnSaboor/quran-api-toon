quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,62,"They swear by God in order to please you [believers]: but it would be more fitting for them to please God and His Messenger, if they are believers"
  9,63,Do they not know that whoever opposes God and His Messenger shall abide forever in the fire of Hell? That is the supreme humiliation
  9,64,"The hypocrites are afraid lest a chapter [of the Quran] be sent down about them, telling them what is in their hearts -- say, \"Go on mocking. God will surely bring to light what you are dreading"
  9,65,"If you ask them, they will say, \"We were only joking and playing with words.\" Say, \"Would you make a mockery of God and of His Revelations and of His Messenger"
  9,66,"Make no excuses; you rejected the faith after you accepted it.\" If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you, for they are guilty"
  9,67,"The hypocrites, both men and women, are all alike. They enjoin what is evil, forbid what is right and they are niggardly when it comes to spending for the cause of God. They have forgotten God, so He has forgotten them. The hypocrites are the disobedient ones"
  9,68,"God has promised the hypocrites, both men and women, and those who deny the truth, the Fire of Hell. They shall abide in it forever. That is a sufficient recompense for them. God has rejected them. They shall have everlasting punishment"
