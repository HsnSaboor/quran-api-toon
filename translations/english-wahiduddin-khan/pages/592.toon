quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,But you prefer the life of this world
  87,17,although the Hereafter is better and more lasting
  87,18,This indeed is what is taught in the former scriptures
  87,19,the scriptures of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Have you heard about the Overwhelming Event
  88,2,"On that Day, there shall be downcast faces"
  88,3,"labouring, weary"
  88,4,they shall enter a burning Fire
  88,5,and will be made to drink from a boiling spring
  88,6,they shall have no food but thorns
  88,7,which will neither nourish nor satisfy hunger
  88,8,Some faces on that Day will be radiant
  88,9,well pleased with the result of their striving
  88,10,in a sublime garden
  88,11,where they will hear no idle talk
  88,12,with a flowing spring
  88,13,raised couches
  88,14,and goblets set at hand
  88,15,cushions ranged
  88,16,and carpets spread out
  88,17,Do they never reflect on the camels and how they were created
  88,18,"and on the sky, how it is raised aloft"
  88,19,"and on the mountains, how they are firmly set up"
  88,20,"and on the earth, how it is spread out"
  88,21,"So, [O Prophet] exhort them: your task is only to exhort"
  88,22,you are not their keeper
  88,23,But whoever turns back and denies the truth
  88,24,will be punished by God with the greatest punishment
  88,25,"Certainly, it is to Us that they will return"
  88,26,"Then, surely, it is for Us to call them to account"
