quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,For the security of the Quraysh
  106,2,their security in their winter and summer journeys
  106,3,So let them worship the Lord of this House
  106,4,who provided them with food lest they go hungry and saved them from fear
  107,1,Have you seen one who denies the Day of Judgement
  107,2,Who turns away the orphan
  107,3,and who does not urge the feeding of the poor
  107,4,So woe to those who pray
  107,5,but whose hearts are not in their prayer
  107,6,Those who do things only to be seen by others
  107,7,Who are uncharitable even over very small things
  108,1,We have given you abundance
  108,2,Pray to your Lord and sacrifice to Him alone
  108,3,It is the one who hates you who has been cut off
