  77,20,Did We not create you from a humble fluid
  77,21,"then placed it in a secure repository [the womb]"
  77,22,for an appointed term
  77,23,Thus We have determined the stages of development and Our power to determine is excellent indeed
  77,24,Woe on that Day to those who reject the truth
  77,25,Have We not made the earth a receptacle
  77,26,for the living and the dead
  77,27,Have We not placed high mountains upon it and given you fresh water to drink
  77,28,Woe on that Day to those who reject the truth
  77,29,Proceed to that which you denied
  77,30,Proceed to a shadow rising in three columns
  77,31,"affording neither shade, nor protection from the flames"
  77,32,and throwing up sparks as huge as towers
  77,33,and as bright as a herd of yellow camels
  77,34,Woe on that Day to those who reject the truth
  77,35,On that Day they will be speechless
  77,36,nor shall they be permitted to offer excuses
  77,37,Woe on that Day to those who reject the truth

  77,46,"Eat [your fill] and enjoy your life for a little while, O you who are lost in sin"
