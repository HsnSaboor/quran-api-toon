quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,21,"Those who do not expect a meeting with Us say, \"Why are angels not sent down to us?\" Or \"Why do we not see our Lord?\" Surely, they are too proud of themselves and have greatly exceeded all bounds"
  25,22,"There will be no good tidings for the guilty on the day they see the angels; and they will cry out, \"Keep away, keep away"
  25,23,and We shall take all that they did and turn it into scattered dust
  25,24,The inhabitants of the Garden will have the best residence and the finest lodging on that Day
  25,25,On a Day when the sky will split open with its clouds and the angels are sent down rank upon rank
  25,26,"true sovereignty on that Day will belong to the Gracious One, and it will be a hard Day for those who deny the truth"
  25,27,"On that Day, the wrongdoer will bite his hands and say, \"Would that I had walked in the Messenger's path"
  25,28,"Oh, would that I had never chosen such a one for my companion"
  25,29,he made me forgetful of the warning after it had reached me. Satan is man's great betrayer
  25,30,"The Messenger will say, \"Lord, my people did indeed discard the Quran"
  25,31,thus did We assign to every prophet an enemy from among the sinners; your Lord is sufficient as a guide and a helper
  25,32,"Those who deny the truth say, \"Why was the Quran not sent down to him in a single revelation?\" We sent it in this manner, so that We might strengthen your heart. We gave it to you in gradual revelation"
