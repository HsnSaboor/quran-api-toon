quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,For he thought and he plotted
  74,19,and woe to him; how he plotted
  74,20,Let him be destroyed. How he calculated
  74,21,Then he looked round
  74,22,then he frowned and scowled
  74,23,and he turned his back and behaved arrogantly
  74,24,"and said, \"This is nothing but sorcery from the ancients"
  74,25,This is nothing but the word of a mortal
  74,26,Soon I will cast him into hell
  74,27,What could make you conceive what hell-fire is
  74,28,"It does not allow anyone to live, and neither does it leave anyone to die"
  74,29,it scorches the skin
  74,30,"there are nineteen [angels] in charge of it"
  74,31,"We have appointed only angels to be wardens of the Fire. We have specified their number only as a trial for those who are bent on denying the truth, so that those who were given the Book might gain in certainty, and those who believe might increase in faith -- and so that neither those who have been given the Scripture nor the believers might have any doubts, and that those sick at heart and those who deny the truth might ask, \"What does God mean by this parable?\" In this way, God lets go astray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills. And none knows the forces of your Lord but He. This is but a Reminder for man"
  74,32,"No, by the moon"
  74,33,By the night when it departs
  74,34,By the dawn when it lightens
  74,35,"Surely, it is one of the gravest things"
  74,36,it is a warning to man
  74,37,"alike to every one of you, who want to go forward or hang back"
  74,38,Every soul is held in pledge against its own deeds
  74,39,except those of the right hand
  74,40,who in their gardens will be enquiring
  74,41,about the sinners
  74,42,What has brought you into the Fire of Hell
  74,43,"and they shall reply, \"We were not among those who prayed"
  74,44,and we did not feed the poor
  74,45,we indulged in vain arguments along with those who indulged in them
  74,46,and we denied the Day of Judgement
  74,47,"until the Inevitable End [death] overtook us"
