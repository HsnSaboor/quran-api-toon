  37,26,"indeed, on that Day they will surrender themselves"
  37,27,"They will turn upon one another, and question one another"
  37,28,"They will say, \"You used to come at us from the right"
  37,29,"They will say, \"No! It was you who would not believe"
  37,30,we had no power over you; but you yourselves were a rebellious people
  37,31,"But now our Lord's word has come true against us: truly, we are bound to taste [the punishment]"
