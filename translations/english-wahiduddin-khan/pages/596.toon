quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,none shall enter it but the most wicked
  92,16,"who denied [the truth], and turned away"
  92,17,One who fears God shall be kept away from it
  92,18,one who gives his wealth to become purified
  92,19,"and owes no favour to anyone, which is to be repaid"
  92,20,acting only for the sake of his Lord the Most High
  92,21,and before long he will be well satisfied
  93,1,By the glorious morning light
  93,2,and by the night when it darkens
  93,3,"your Lord has not forsaken you, nor is He displeased with you"
  93,4,and the Hereafter will indeed be better for you than the present life
  93,5,soon you will be gratified with what your Lord will give you
  93,6,Did He not find you orphaned and shelter you
  93,7,"Did He not find you wandering, and give you guidance"
  93,8,"Did He not find you in want, and make you free from want"
  93,9,Therefore do not treat the orphan with harshness
  93,10,and do not chide the one who asks for help
  93,11,but proclaim the blessings of your Lord
  94,1,Have We not lifted up your heart
  94,2,and removed your burden
  94,3,"that weighed so heavily on your back, and"
  94,4,have We not given you high renown
  94,5,"So, surely with every hardship there is ease"
  94,6,"surely, with every hardship there is ease"
  94,7,"So, when you are free, strive hard"
  94,8,"and to your Lord turn [all] your attention"
