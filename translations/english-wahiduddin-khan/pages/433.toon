  34,40,"On the Day when He gathers them all together, He will ask the angels, \"Was it you that these people worshipped"
  34,41,"They will say, \"Glory be to You! You are our protector, not them. Indeed no! They worshipped the jinn; it was in them that most of them believed"
  34,42,"Today you possess no power to benefit or harm one another. We shall say to the wrongdoers, \"Suffer the punishment of the Fire that you persistently denied"

  34,48,"Say to them, \"My Lord hurls forth the Truth [at falsehood] and He is the knower of hidden things"
