quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"Those who live on usury shall rise up before God like men whom Satan has demented by his touch; for they say, \"Buying and selling is only a kind of usury.\" But God has made trade lawful and made usury unlawful. Therefore, he who desists because of the admonition that has come to him from his Lord may retain what he has received in the past; and it will be for God to judge him. Those who revert to it shall be the inmates of the Fire; they shall abide therein forever"
  2,276,God blights usury and blesses charitable deeds. God does not love the ungrateful wrongdoer
  2,277,"Those who believe, do good deeds, attend to their prayers and engage in almsgiving, shall be rewarded by their Lord and shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve"
  2,278,"Believers, have fear of God, and give up what is still due to you from usury, if you are true believers"
  2,279,"For, if you do not do so, then know that you are at war with God and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may retain your capital. Do not wrong [others] and you will not be wronged"
  2,280,"If the debtor is in straitened circumstances, then grant him respite till a time of ease. If you were to write it off as an act of charity, that would be better for you, if only you knew"
  2,281,Fear the Day when you shall be made to return to God; then every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned; and they shall not be wronged
