quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,71,People of the Book! Why do you mix truth with falsehood and knowingly conceal the truth
  3,72,"Some of the People of the Book say to one another, \"Believe in what is revealed to the faithful in the morning and deny it in the evening, so that they [the Muslims] may themselves abandon their faith [in confusion]"
  3,73,"Believe only in those who follow your own religion.\" Say to them, \"Surely, the true guidance is the guidance from God.\" [But you think it is impossible that] someone else may be granted [revelation] such as you were granted -- or else that they should contend against you before your Lord. Say, \"All grace is in the hands of God; He grants it to whom He wills: for God is boundless, and all knowing"
  3,74,He singles out for His mercy whoever He pleases. God is the Lord of exceeding bounty
  3,75,"Among the people of the Book there are some who, if you entrust them with a heap of gold, will return it to you. But there are others of them who, if you entrust them with a single dinar, will not return it to you, unless you keep demanding it from them. That is because they say, \"We are under no obligation towards the gentiles.\" They deliberately tell lies about God"
  3,76,Indeed God loves those who honour their covenants and fear Him. God loves the righteous
  3,77,"Those who sell out God's covenant and their oaths for a paltry price will have no share in the life to come on the Day of Resurrection. God will neither speak to them nor cast a look upon them on the Day of Judgement, nor will He purify them. For them there shall be a grievous punishment"
