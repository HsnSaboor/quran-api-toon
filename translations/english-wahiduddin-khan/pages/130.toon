quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Ask them, \"What carries the most weight as a witness?\" Tell them it is God. He is a witness between you and me. Say, \"This Quran has been revealed to me so that through it I may warn you and whoever it reaches. Do you really bear witness that there are other deities beside God?\" Say, \"I do not bear witness to this.\" Say, \"He is only one God, and I disown whatever you associate with Him"
  6,20,Those to whom We have given the Scriptures know this as they know their own sons. But those who have ruined their souls will not believe
  6,21,"Who does greater wrong than he who invents a lie against God and denies His signs? Assuredly, the wrongdoers will not succeed"
  6,22,"On the Day when We gather them all together, We will say to those who associated [others with Us], \"Where are those partners that you claimed"
  6,23,"Then they will have no excuse but to say, \"By God our Lord, we have never been polytheists"
  6,24,"See how they lie to themselves, and how those [the deities] they invented have deserted them"
  6,25,"Among them are some who listen to you, but We have placed veils over their hearts and deafness in their ears which prevent them from understanding what you say. Even if they saw all the signs, they would still not believe in them. When those who deny the truth come to dispute with you, they will say, \"This is nothing but ancient fables"
  6,26,"and they bar others from believing and themselves keep away. But they ruin no one but themselves, though they fail to realize this"
  6,27,"If you could only see when they are set before the Fire. They will say, \"If only we could be sent back. Then we would not deny the signs of our Lord and we would be of the believers"
