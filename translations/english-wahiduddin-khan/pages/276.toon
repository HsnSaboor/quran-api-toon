quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,80,"God has made your houses places of rest for you and made tents for you out of cattle hides, which are light for you to carry, both when you are travelling and when you are staying in one place. He provides for you from the wool and fur and hair of cattle, household goods and articles for use for a time"
  16,81,"God has granted you shade out of what He has created, places of shelter in the mountains, garments with which to protect yourselves from the heat and coats of mail to shield you in battle. Thus He completes His favour to you, so that you may submit wholly to Him"
  16,82,"But if they turn away, you are responsible only for conveying the message clearly"
  16,83,"They recognize the favour of God, yet they deny it; and most of them are ungrateful"
  16,84,"On the Day when We raise up a witness from every people, those who were bent on denying the truth will not be permitted to put forward excuses, or to make amends"
  16,85,"When the wrongdoers face their punishment, it shall not be lightened for them, nor shall they be granted any reprieve"
  16,86,"When those who associate partners with God see their associate gods, they will say, \"Our Lord, these are our associate gods whom we used to call upon instead of You.\" But they will throw back their words at them, [saying], \"Indeed you are liars"
  16,87,"and on that Day they will offer total submission to God: and all that they used to devise will fail them"
