  72,1,"Say, \"It has been revealed to me that a band of the jinn listened [to the Quran] and they said, \"We have heard a really wonderful recital"
  72,2,which guides to the right path; so we have believed in it and we will not associate anyone with our Lord
  72,3,"and exalted is the majesty of our Lord, He has taken neither a wife nor a son"
  72,4,"And [now we know] that the foolish among us have been saying outrageous things about God"
  72,5,We had supposed that men and jinn would never utter a lie against God
  72,6,"Some men used to seek refuge with the jinn in the past, but that only increased their insolence"
  72,7,"They thought, as you did, that God would never raise up anyone from the dead"
  72,8,"We sought to reach heaven, but found it filled with strong guards and flames"
  72,9,"we used to take up a position to listen, but whoever listens now finds a flaming fire lying in wait for him"
  72,10,we cannot tell if this bodes evil to those who dwell on earth or whether their Lord intends to guide them
  72,11,"Some of us are righteous, while others are not; we follow divergent paths"
  72,12,We have realized that we could never thwart God on earth and that we would never be able to thwart Him by flight
  72,13,"When we heard the call to guidance, we believed in it. He who believes in his Lord has no fear of loss or of injustice"
