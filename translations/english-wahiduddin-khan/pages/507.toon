quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"God will bring to naught all the good deeds of those who are bent on denying the truth and bar [others] from the path of God"
  47,2,"As for those who believe and do good deeds and believe in what has been revealed to Muhammad, and it is the truth from their Lord, God will remove their sins from them and set their condition right"
  47,3,"That is because the ones who deny the truth follow falsehood, while those who believe follow the Truth from their Lord. Thus God sets forth comparisons for mankind"
  47,4,"When you meet those who deny the truth in battle, strike them in the neck, and once they are defeated, make [them] prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as an act of grace, or let them ransom [themselves] until the war is finally over. Thus you shall do; and if God had pleased, He would certainly have exacted retribution from them, but His purpose is to test some of you by means of others. As for those who are killed in God's cause, He will never let their deeds be in vain"
  47,5,He will guide them and improve their condition
  47,6,He will admit them into the Garden He has already made known to them
  47,7,"Believers! If you succour God, He will succour you and make your footsteps firm"
  47,8,"But as for those who are bent on denying the truth, destruction will be their lot, and [God] will make their deeds come to nothing"
  47,9,It is because they are averse to what God has revealed that He has rendered their deeds futile
  47,10,"Have they not travelled the earth and seen how those before them met their end? God destroyed them utterly: a similar fate awaits those who deny the truth"
  47,11,"That is because God is the protector of the believers, and those who deny the truth have no protector at all"
