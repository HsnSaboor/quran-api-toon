quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,25,"Give the good news to those who believe and do good works, that they will have Gardens through which rivers flow: whenever they are given fruit to eat they will say, \"This is what we were provided with before,\" because they were given similar things. And there will be pure spouses for them, and they will abide there forever"
  2,26,"God does not disdain to give a parable about a gnat or a smaller creature. The faithful know that it is the truth from their Lord, but those who deny the truth ask, \"What could God mean by this parable?\" He lets many go astray through it, and guides many by it. But He makes only the disobedient go astray"
  2,27,"those who break God's covenant after they have pledged to keep it, and sever whatever God has ordered to be joined, and spread corruption in the land -- it is they who are the losers"
  2,28,"How can you disbelieve in God when you were dead [lifeless] and He gave you life? He will let you die once more, then bring you back to life again, whereupon you will be returned to Him"
  2,29,"It is He who created everything on the earth for you: then He turned towards heaven and fashioned it into the seven heavens. He has knowledge of all things"
