quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,102,"This is God, your Lord, there is no God but Him, the Creator of all things, so worship Him; He is the guardian of all things"
  6,103,"No vision can grasp Him, but He takes in over all vision; He is the Subtle and Aware One"
  6,104,"Clear insights have come to you from your Lord. Whoever, therefore, chooses to see, does so for his own good; and whoever chooses to remain blind, does so to his own loss. Say, \"I am not here as your keeper"
  6,105,"This is how We explain Our revelations in various ways -- so that they might come to the point of saying, \"You have read this out to us,\" and that We might make it clear [that this is the truth] to those who are eager to know"
  6,106,"Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord: there is no deity but Him; and ignore the polytheists"

  6,108,"Do not revile those [beings] whom they invoke instead of God, lest they, in their hostility, revile God out of ignorance. Thus to every people We have caused their actions to seem fair. To their Lord they shall all return, and He will declare to them all that they have done"
  6,109,"They swear a solemn oath by God that if there should come to them a sign, they will believe in it. Say, \"Signs are granted only by God.\" How can you tell that if a sign be given to them, they will indeed believe in it"
  6,110,"We will turn away their hearts and eyes from the Truth, since they refused to believe in it in the first instance. We will let them wander blindly in their insolence"
