quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  69,9,Pharoah and those before him and the inhabitants of the overthrown cities persistently committed grave sins
  69,10,"They defied their Lord's messenger, so He seized them with an ever-tightening grip"
  69,11,"But We bore you away in the Ark, when the waters rose high"
  69,12,so that We might make it a reminder for you and so that attentive ears might retain it
  69,13,When a single blast is blown on the trumpet
  69,14,and the earth and the mountains are lifted up and then crushed with a single blow
  69,15,on that Day the Great Event will come to pass
  69,16,"And the sky will be rent asunder, for on that Day it will be so frail"
  69,17,"The angels will appear by its sides and, on that Day, eight [angels] will bear your Lord's throne above them"
  69,18,On that Day you will be brought to judgement and none of your secrets will remain hidden
  69,19,"Then he who is given his record in his right hand will exclaim, \"Here is my record, read it"
  69,20,"Surely, I knew that I should meet my reckoning"
  69,21,so he will live in a state of Bliss
  69,22,in a lofty garden
  69,23,with clusters of fruit within easy reach
  69,24,"We shall say to him, \"Eat and drink joyfully as a reward for the good deeds you did in days gone by"
  69,25,"But he who is given his record in his left hand will say, \"If only I had never been given my Record"
  69,26,and knew nothing of my reckoning
  69,27,How I wish my death had ended all
  69,28,My wealth has been of no use to me
  69,29,I am bereft of power
  69,30,Seize him and fetter him
  69,31,and then let him enter Hell
  69,32,Then fasten him with a chain seventy cubits long
  69,33,for he did not believe in Almighty God
  69,34,nor did he feel any urge to feed the needy
