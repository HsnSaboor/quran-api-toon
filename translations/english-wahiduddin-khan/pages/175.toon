quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"Say, \"I myself have no power to benefit or do harm, save as God pleases. If I had knowledge of the unseen, I would have availed myself of an abundance of good, and no harm would have touched me. I am but a warner and a bearer of good tidings for those who will believe"
  7,189,"It was He who created you from a single soul, and from it made its mate so that he may find comfort in her. Once he has covered her, she conceives and goes about with a light burden. When it grows heavy, they both call to God, their Lord, \"If You bestow on us a healthy child, we will surely be grateful"
  7,190,"yet when He grants them a healthy child, they begin to ascribe to others a share in the gift they have received. But God is far above what they associate with Him"
  7,191,Do they associate with Him those who create nothing and are themselves created
  7,192,"They can give them no help, nor can they help themselves"
  7,193,"It makes no difference whether you call on them or remain silent. If you call them to the right path, they will not follow you"
  7,194,"Those whom you call on besides God are but creatures like yourselves. Call upon them, then, and let them respond to you, if what you say is true"
  7,195,"Have they feet to walk with? Have they hands to hold with? Have they eyes to see with? Have they ears to hear with? Say, \"Call upon those you associate with God as partners, then all of you contrive against me and give me no respite"
