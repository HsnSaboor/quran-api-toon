quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,137,this is nothing but a habit of the ancients
  26,138,and we shall not be punished
  26,139,So they rejected him; and We destroyed them. There is certainly a sign in that; but most of them would not believe
  26,140,"Surely your Lord is the Mighty One, the Merciful"
  26,141,The tribe of Thamud also rejected the messengers
  26,142,"When their brother Salih said to them, \"Will you not fear God"
  26,143,"Truly, I am a trustworthy messenger for you"
  26,144,so fear God and obey me
  26,145,For this I demand no recompense from you; my reward is only with the Lord of the Universe
  26,146,"Do you think that you will be left secure [forever]"
  26,147,in the midst of gardens and fountains
  26,148,"and cornfields, and palm-trees laden with fruit"
  26,149,hewing out houses in the mountains and taking pride in your skill
  26,150,So fear God and obey me
  26,151,do not obey the bidding of those who are given to excesses
  26,152,those who spread corruption in the land instead of putting things right
  26,153,"They replied, \"Surely you are bewitched"
  26,154,"You are only a human being like ourselves. Show us a sign, if you are telling the truth"
  26,155,"He said, \"Here is a she-camel. She shall have her turn of drinking, as you have yours, each on an appointed day"
  26,156,"so do her no harm, or the punishment of an awful day will befall you"
  26,157,"Yet they hamstrung her, and then they became regretful"
  26,158,"so the punishment came down upon them. Surely in that there is a sign, but most of them would not believe"
  26,159,"Your Lord is the Mighty One, the Merciful"
