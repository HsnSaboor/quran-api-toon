quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,106,"Ask God for forgiveness: He is most forgiving and merciful"
  4,107,And do not plead on behalf of those who are dishonest to themselves. Surely God does not love one who is treacherous and sinful
  4,108,"They feel ashamed before men but do not feel ashamed before God, despite His being present with them when they plot at night, uttering things of which He does not approve; and indeed God is fully aware of what they do"
  4,109,"You might argue on their behalf in the life of this world: but who will argue on their behalf with God on the Day of Resurrection and who will be their defender"
  4,110,Yet anyone who does evil or wrongs his own soul and then asks God for forgiveness will find God forgiving and merciful
  4,111,He who commits sin does so against his own soul. God is all knowing and wise
  4,112,"And anyone who commits an offence or a sin, then charges an innocent person with it, shall certainly bear the guilt of a calumny and a manifest sin"
  4,113,"If it were not for the grace of God and His mercy to you, some of them had resolved to lead you astray but they lead astray no one but themselves. Nor can they do you any harm. God has sent down to you the Book and Wisdom and has taught you what you did not know. God's favour to you has been great indeed"
