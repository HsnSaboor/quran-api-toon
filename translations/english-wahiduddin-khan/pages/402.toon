quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  29,46,"Believers, argue only in the best way with the People of the Book, [but contend not at all] with such of them as are unjust. Say, \"We believe in what has been revealed to us, and what has been revealed to you; our God and your God are one; and to Him we submit"
  29,47,"Likewise We have sent down the Book to you. Those to whom We gave the scripture believe in it, and so do some of your own people. Only those who deny the truth reject Our revelations"
  29,48,"You were not able to read any book before this, nor did you write one down with your hand. If you had done so, the followers of falsehood would have had cause to doubt it"
  29,49,But the Quran is a revelation that is clear to the hearts of those endowed with knowledge. Only the evil-doers refuse to acknowledge Our revelations
  29,50,"They say, \"Why has no sign been given to him by his Lord?\" Say, \"The signs are in the hands of God. I am but a plain warner"
  29,51,Is it not sufficient for them that We have sent you down the Book to be recited to them? In this surely there is a blessing and an admonition for a people who believe
  29,52,"Say, \"God is sufficient as a witness between you and me. He knows all that is in the heavens and the earth. Those who believe in falsehood and reject God will surely be the losers"
