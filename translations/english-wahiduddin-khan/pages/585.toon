quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and turned away
  80,2,when the blind man approached him
  80,3,for how can you know that he might seek to purify himself
  80,4,"or take heed and derive benefit from [Our] warning"
  80,5,As for him who was indifferent
  80,6,you eagerly attended to him
  80,7,though you are not to be blamed if he would not purify himself
  80,8,"but as for one who comes to you, eagerly"
  80,9,and in awe of God
  80,10,you pay him no heed
  80,11,"Indeed, this [Quran] is an admonition"
  80,12,"Let him who will, pay heed to it"
  80,13,It is set down on honoured pages
  80,14,exalted and purified
  80,15,by the hands of
  80,16,noble and virtuous scribes
  80,17,Woe to man! How ungrateful he is
  80,18,"Of what [stuff] has He created him"
  80,19,Out of a drop of sperm! He creates and proportions him
  80,20,He makes his path easy for him
  80,21,Then He causes him to die and be buried
  80,22,"Then when He pleases, He will bring him back to life"
  80,23,Yet man declines to do His bidding
  80,24,Let man reflect on the food he eats
  80,25,We let the rain pour down in torrents
  80,26,and then We cleaved the earth asunder
  80,27,We make the grain grow out of it
  80,28,and grape vines and vegetables
  80,29,and olive trees and date palms
  80,30,and burgeoning enclosed gardens
  80,31,and fruits and fodder
  80,32,as provision for you and for your cattle to enjoy
  80,33,But when the deafening blast is sounded
  80,34,on that Day a man shall flee from his own brother
  80,35,"his mother, his father"
  80,36,his wife and his sons
  80,37,on that Day every man among them will have enough concern of his own
  80,38,on that Day some faces will be beaming
  80,39,"laughing, and rejoicing"
  80,40,but some faces will be covered with dust
  80,41,and overcast with gloom
  80,42,those will be ones who denied the truth and were immersed in iniquity
