quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  76,26,"and during the night prostrate ourself before Him, and extol His glory for a long part of the night"
  76,27,"Those people [who are unmindful of God] aspire for immediate gains, and put behind them a Heavy Day"
  76,28,"It was We who created them and made their constitution strong, but if We wish we can replace them with others like them"
  76,29,"This is a reminder. Let whoever wishes, take the right path to his Lord"
  76,30,"But you cannot will it unless God wills [to show you that way] -- God is indeed all-knowing and wise"
  76,31,He admits whoever He will into His grace and has prepared a painful punishment for the evil doers
  77,1,By the winds sent forth in swift succession
  77,2,and then storming on with a tempest's force
  77,3,and the rain-spreading winds
  77,4,separating one from another
  77,5,by those who bring down the reminder
  77,6,to excuse some and warn others
  77,7,that which you have been promised shall be fulfilled
  77,8,When the stars lose their light
  77,9,and when the sky is rent asunder
  77,10,and when the mountains crumble into dust
  77,11,and when the messengers are brought together at the appointed time
  77,12,for what Day has this been appointed
  77,13,For the Day of Decision
  77,14,What will explain to you what the Day of Judgement is
  77,15,Woe on that Day to those who reject the truth
  77,16,Did We not destroy the earlier peoples
  77,17,We will now cause the later ones to follow them
  77,18,thus do We deal with the culprits
  77,19,Woe on that Day to those who reject the truth
