quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"There is no good in most of their secret talk, except in the case of those who enjoin charity and kindness, or reconciliation between people. If anyone does that, seeking the pleasure of God, We will give him an immense reward"
  4,115,"But if anyone opposes the Messenger after his guidance has become clear to him, and follows a path other than that of the faithful, We shall let him pursue his chosen path and shall cast him into Hell: an evil destination"
  4,116,"Surely, God will not forgive the ascribing of partners to Him. He forgives whoever He will for anything other than that. Whoever ascribes partners to God has strayed far indeed"
  4,117,"They [the polytheists] call upon female deities, and they invoke none but Satan, the rebellious one"
  4,118,"whom God has rejected. He said [to God], \"I will assuredly take a number of Your servants"
  4,119,"and shall lead them astray, and fill them with vain desires and order them to slit the ears of cattle. I shall order them to tamper with God's creation. Whoever chooses Satan as a patron instead of God is utterly ruined"
  4,120,"he holds out promises to them, and fills them with vain desires: but Satan's promises are nothing but delusion"
  4,121,"Hell shall be their home: they shall find no refuge from it"
