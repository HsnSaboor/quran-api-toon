quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  8,34,"Yet why should God not punish them when they debar people from the Sacred Mosque, although they are not its guardians? Its rightful guardians are those who fear God, though most of them do not realize it"
  8,35,"Their prayers at the Sacred House are nothing but whistling and clapping of hands. \"So taste the punishment because of your denial"
  8,36,"Those who are bent on denying the truth are spending their wealth in debarring others from the path of God. They will continue to spend it in this way till, in the end, this spending will become a source of intense regret for them, and then they will be overcome. And those who denied the truth will be gathered together in Hell"
  8,37,"So that God may separate the bad from the good, He will heap the wicked one upon another and then cast them into Hell. These will surely be the losers"
  8,38,"Tell those who are bent on denying the truth that if they desist, their past shall be forgiven, but if they persist in sin, they have an example in the fate of those who went before"
  8,39,"Fight them until there is no more [religious] persecution, and religion belongs wholly to God: if they desist, then surely God is watchful of what they do"
  8,40,"but if they turn away, know that God is your Protector; the Best of Protectors and the Best of Helpers"
