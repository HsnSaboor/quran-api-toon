quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,71,"and they imagined that no harm would come to them; and so they became blind and deaf [of heart]. God turned to them in mercy; yet again many of them became blind and deaf. God is fully aware of their actions"
  5,72,"Indeed, they are deniers of the truth who say, \"God is the Christ, the son of Mary.\" For the Christ himself said, \"Children of Israel, serve God, my Lord and your Lord.\" If anyone associates anything with God, God will forbid him the Garden and the Fire will be his home. The wrongdoers shall have no helpers"
  5,73,"They are deniers of the truth who say, \"God is one of three.\" There is only One God. If they do not desist from so saying, a painful punishment is bound to befall such of them as are bent on denying the truth"
  5,74,Why do they not turn to God and ask for His forgiveness? God is forgiving and merciful
  5,75,"Christ, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger. Many messengers passed away before him. His mother was a virtuous woman; and they both ate food [like other mortals]. See how We make the signs clear to them! See how they turn away"
  5,76,"Say, \"Do you worship something other than God, that has no power to do you harm or good? God alone is the All Hearing and All Knowing"
