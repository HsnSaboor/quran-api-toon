quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,16,"those who say, \"Lord, we believe in You, forgive us our sins and keep us from the punishment of the Fire"
  3,17,"those who are steadfast, truthful, obedient, and those who spend [for God's cause] and who pray before dawn for forgiveness"
  3,18,"God bears witness that there is no deity save Him, as do the angels and those who possess knowledge. He is the upholder of justice. There is no diety save Him, the Mighty, the Wise One"
  3,19,"The only true religion in God's sight is complete submission to God. And those who were given the Book disagreed only out of rivalry, after knowledge had been given to them -- he who denies God's signs should know that God is swift in His reckoning"
  3,20,"If they dispute with you, say, \"I have submitted my whole being to God and so have those who follow me.\" And ask those who have been given the Book, as well as the unlettered, \"Do you submit yourselves to God in the same way?\" If they submit themselves to Him, they are on the right path; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the message. God is observant of all His servants"
  3,21,"Those who deny God's signs and kill the prophets unjustly and kill those who enjoin justice, give them warning of a woeful punishment"
  3,22,their deeds will come to nothing in this world as well as in the hereafter; they will have no supporters
