quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,170,"But when they are told, \"Follow what God has sent down,\" they answer, \"We will follow the ways of our fathers,\" even though their fathers did not use their reason, and were devoid of all guidance"
  2,171,"Those who deny the truth are like animals which hear nothing in your call but the sound of a voice, without understanding its meaning. They are deaf, dumb and blind. They understand nothing"
  2,172,"Believers, eat the wholesome things which We have provided for you and give thanks to God, if it is Him you worship"
  2,173,"He has forbidden you only carrion, blood, and the flesh of swine; also any flesh that is consecrated other than in the name of God. But for one who is driven by necessity, neither craving nor transgressing, it is no sin. For God is forgiving and merciful"
  2,174,"Those who conceal any part of the Scriptures which God has revealed in order to gain some paltry end, simply fill their bellies with Fire. On the Day of Resurrection, God will neither speak to them nor purify them. They will have a painful punishment"
  2,175,Those are the ones who have taken error in exchange for guidance and punishment for forgiveness. How little do they seem to fear the Fire
  2,176,That is because God has sent down the Book with the truth. And those who pursue differences in the Scriptures go much too far in dissension
