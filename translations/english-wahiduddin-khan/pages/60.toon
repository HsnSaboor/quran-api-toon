quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,78,"There are some among them who distort the Book by the way they speak to make you think that what they say is from the Book, whereas it is not. They say it is from God whereas it is not. Thus they tell a lie about God and they know it"
  3,79,"No one to whom God has given the Scriptures and on whom He has bestowed wisdom and prophethood would say to men, \"Worship me instead of God.\" [He would say rather], \"Be devoted servants of God, for you have taught and studied the Scriptures"
  3,80,Nor would he enjoin you to take the angels and the prophets as your lords; how could he command you to be disbelievers after you have submitted to God
  3,81,"When God made a covenant with the prophets, He said, \"Here is the Book and the wisdom which I have given you. When there comes to you a messenger fulfilling that [predictions about him in their Scripture] which is with you, you must believe in him and help him. Do you then affirm this and accept the responsibility I have laid upon you in these terms?\" They said, \"We will affirm it.\" God said, \"Then bear witness, and I will bear witness with you"
  3,82,"Now whoever turns away after this, are surely transgressors"
  3,83,"Do they seek a religion other than the religion of God, when everything in the heavens and the earth has submitted to Him, willingly or unwillingly? To Him they shall all return"
