quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,And the hearts' contents shall be brought into the open
  100,11,"Surely, on that Day, they will know that their Lord had full knowledge of them all"
  101,1,The Clatterer
  101,2,What is the Clatterer
  101,3,Would that you knew what the Clatterer is
  101,4,"[It is] a Day when mankind shall be like scattered moths"
  101,5,and the mount-ains like tufts of carded wool
  101,6,"Then, the one whose good deeds weigh heavy on the scales"
  101,7,will have a most pleasing life
  101,8,But as for him whose deeds are light on the scales
  101,9,the Abyss shall be his home
  101,10,What will convey to you what this is like
  101,11,It is a blazing fire
  102,1,"Greed for more and more distracted you [from God]"
  102,2,till you reached the grave
  102,3,But you will soon come to know
  102,4,But you will soon come to know
  102,5,"Indeed, were you to know the truth with certainty"
  102,6,you would see the fire of Hell
  102,7,You would see it with the eye of certainty
  102,8,Then on that Day you shall be questioned about your worldly favours
