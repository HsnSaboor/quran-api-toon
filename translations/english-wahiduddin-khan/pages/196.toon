quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,55,"Do not let their wealth and children impress you. For God seeks to punish them through these things in the life of this world, so that their souls shall depart while they are still denying the truth"
  9,56,"They swear by God that they are believers like you; but they are not. They are afraid [to appear in their true colours]"
  9,57,"if they could find a place of refuge, or a cave or any hiding-place, they would run there with frantic haste"
  9,58,"Among them there are some who find fault with you concerning the distribution of alms. If a share is given to them, they are pleased, but if they receive nothing, they grow resentful"
  9,59,"If only they had been content with what God and His Messenger had given them and had said, \"God is sufficient for us. God will give us out of His bounty, and so will His Messenger. To God alone do we turn with hope"
  9,60,"Alms are only for: the poor and the destitute, for those who collect zakat, for conciliating people's hearts, for freeing slaves, for those in debt, for spending for God's cause, and for travellers in need. It is a legal obligation enjoined by God. God is all-knowing and wise"
  9,61,"Among them are those who vex the Prophet by saying, \"He listens to everyone.\" Say, \"His listening to everyone is good for you; he believes in God and puts his trust in the faithful, and is a mercy to those of you who believe. Those who annoy God's Messenger shall have a painful punishment"
