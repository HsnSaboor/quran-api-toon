quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  18,16,"Now that you have withdrawn from them and from all that they worship instead of God, take refuge in that cave; your Lord will extend His mercy to you and will make fitting provision for you in your situation"
  18,17,"The sun could be observed to incline away from their cave on the right, as it rose, and to turn away from them on the left, when it set, while they lay in the wide space inside the cave. This is one of the signs of God. He whom God guides is rightly guided; but for him whom He lets go astray, you will find no helper or guide"
  18,18,"You would have thought they were awake, though they lay asleep. We turned them over, to the right and the left, while their dog lay at the cave's entrance with legs outstretched. Had you looked down and seen them, you would have surely turned your back and fled in terror"
  18,19,"In the course of time, We raised them up again so that they might question one another. One of them asked, \"How long have you stayed [here]?\" They said, \"We have stayed a day, or part of a day.\" But others said, \"Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed here. Let one of you go then with these silver coins to the town, and let him find out what food is purest there, and bring you back a supply of it. Let him conduct himself with caution and not disclose your whereabouts to anyone"
  18,20,"for if they find you out, they will stone you to death, or force you back into their faith. In that case you would never prosper"
