quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  46,29,"Remember how We sent to you a band of jinn who wished to hear the Quran and as they listened to its recitation, they said to one another, \"Be silent and listen,\" and, then when it was finished, they went back to their people, to give them warning"
  46,30,"They said, \"O our people, we have heard a Book, which has been sent down after Moses, fulfilling the predictions existing in previous scriptures; it guides to the truth, and to the right path"
  46,31,"Our people, respond to the one who calls you to God. Believe in him! God will forgive you your sins and protect you from a painful punishment"
  46,32,"But he who does not respond to God's calls can never elude [Him] on earth, nor can he have any protector against Him. Such people have clearly gone far astray"
  46,33,"Have they not seen that God, who created the heavens and the earth and was not wearied by their creation, has the power to bring the dead back to life? Yes, indeed, He has power over all things"
  46,34,"On the Day when those who deny the truth will be brought before the Fire, they shall be asked, \"Is this not the truth?\" They will reply, \"Yes, by our Lord.\" He will say, \"Then taste the punishment, because of your denial of the truth"
  46,35,"Have patience, then, as had the steadfast Messengers before you; and be in no haste about them. On the Day when they see what they are threatened with, it will appear to them as though they had not tarried longer than an hour of a day. [Your responsibility is] to deliver the message: and none but the disobedient shall be destroyed"
