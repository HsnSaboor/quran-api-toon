quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  85,1,By the sky with its constellations
  85,2,and by the promised Day
  85,3,by the Witness and the witnessed
  85,4,destroyed were the people of the trench
  85,5,the makers of the fuel-stoked fire
  85,6,They sat by it
  85,7,to watch what they were doing to the believers
  85,8,"whom they hated for no other reason than that they believed in God, the Almighty, the Praiseworthy"
  85,9,to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. God is witness over all things
  85,10,"Those who persecute the believing men and believing women, and then do not repent, will surely suffer the punishment of Hell, and the torment of burning"
  85,11,But those who believe and do good deeds shall be rewarded with gardens watered by flowing rivers. That is the supreme triumph
  85,12,The grip of your Lord is indeed severe
  85,13,"it is He who begins and repeats [His creation]"
  85,14,and He is the Forgiving and Loving One
  85,15,The Lord of the Glorious Throne
  85,16,Executor of His own will
  85,17,Have you not heard the story of the hosts
  85,18,of Pharaoh and Thamud
  85,19,Yet those who deny the truth persist in denial
  85,20,God encompasses them from all sides
  85,21,It is indeed a glorious Quran
  85,22,written on a preserved Tablet
