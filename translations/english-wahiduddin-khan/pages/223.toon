quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,13,"If they say, \"He has invented it himself.\" Say, \"If you are truthful, produce ten invented chapters like it, and call on whom you can besides God, to help you"
  11,14,"But if they do not respond to you, then know that this [Quran] is sent down with God's knowledge and that there is no deity but Him. Will you then surrender yourselves to Him"
  11,15,Those who desire the life of this world and all its finery shall be repaid in full in this life for their deeds -- nothing shall be denied them
  11,16,"These are the people who, in the world to come, shall have nothing but Hellfire and all that they used to do shall be in vain"
  11,17,"Can they be compared to those who possess a clear proof from their Lord, followed up by a witness from Him, preceded by the Book of Moses, as a guide and a mercy? These people believe in it; whereas those groups that deny its truth are promised the Fire. Therefore, have no doubt about it. It is the truth from your Lord, but most people do not believe it"
  11,18,"Who does greater wrong than the one who fabricates a lie against God? Such people shall be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, \"These are the ones who lied about their Lord.\" Surely God's rejection is merited by such wrongdoers"
  11,19,"Such as those who turn others away from the path of God and seek to make it appear crooked: these are the ones who deny the Hereafter"
