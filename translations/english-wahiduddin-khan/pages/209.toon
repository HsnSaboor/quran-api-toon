quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,7,"Those who entertain no hope of meeting Us, being pleased and contented with the life of this world, and those who give no heed to Our signs"
  10,8,shall have their abode in the Fire in requital for their deeds
  10,9,Those who believe and do good deeds will be guided by their Lord because of their faith. Rivers shall flow at their feet in the Gardens of Bliss
  10,10,"In that [state of happiness] they will call out; \"Glory be to You, O God!\", while their greeting in it will be: \"Peace!\" And the close of their call will be, \"All praise is due to God, the Lord of the Universe"
  10,11,"Had God hastened the punishment of men as He hastens the good, the end of their term of life would already have been reached. We leave those who do not hope to meet Us groping along in their arrogance"
  10,12,"Whenever any trouble befalls a person, he prays to Us all the time, lying on his side, sitting or standing; but when We remove his trouble, he goes on his way as if he had never prayed to Us for the removal of his trouble. Thus it is that the doings of the transgressors are made to look fair to them"
  10,13,"And indeed, before your time We destroyed [whole] generations when they [persistently] did evil; their messengers came to them with clear signs, but they would not believe. Thus We requite the guilty"
  10,14,"Then We made you their successors in the land, so that We might observe how you would conduct yourselves"
