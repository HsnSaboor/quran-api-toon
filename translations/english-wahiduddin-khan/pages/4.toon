quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"They are like those who kindled a fire, and when it lighted up all around them, God took away their sight and left them in utter darkness, unable to see"
  2,18,"deaf, dumb, and blind: they will never return [to the right path]"
  2,19,"Or their case is like that of heavy rain pouring down from the clouds, accompanied by darkness, thunder and lightning; they thrust their fingers in their ears at the sound of thunderclaps for fear of death. God thus encompasses those who deny the truth"
  2,20,"The lightning almost takes away their sight: whenever it flashes upon them, they walk on, but as soon as darkness falls around them, they stand still. Indeed, if God pleased, He could take away their hearing and their sight: God has power over all things"
  2,21,"People, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, so that you may become righteous"
  2,22,"who made the earth a bed, and the sky a canopy; and it is He who sends down rain from above for the growth of every kind of food for your sustenance. And do not knowingly set up rivals to God"
  2,23,"If you are in doubt about the revelation We have sent down to Our servant, then produce a single chapter like it, and call upon your helpers besides God, if you are truthful"
  2,24,"But if you cannot do it, and you can never do it, then guard yourselves against the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for those who deny the truth"
