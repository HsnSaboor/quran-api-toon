quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  55,68,In both of them there will be fruit trees and date-palms and pomegranates
  55,69,Which of your Lord's wonders would you deny
  55,70,Therein will be maidens chaste and beautiful
  55,71,Which of your Lord's wonders would you deny
  55,72,"[There the blessed will live with their] pure companions sheltered in pavilions"
  55,73,Which of your Lord's wonders would you deny
  55,74,Whom neither a man or jinn had ever touched before them
  55,75,Which of your Lord's wonders would you deny
  55,76,"[They will live in such a paradise] reclining upon green cushions and the finest carpets"
  55,77,Which of your Lord's wonders would you deny
  55,78,"Blessed be your Lord's name, full of glory and majesty"
  56,1,When the inevitable event takes place
  56,2,and there can be no denying its happening
  56,3,some shall be abased and others exalted
  56,4,When the earth is shaken violently
  56,5,and the mountains are totally shattered and crumble to pieces
  56,6,and become like scattered dust particles
  56,7,"[on that Day] you shall be divided into three groups"
  56,8,Those on the Right -- how blessed are those on the Right
  56,9,Those on the Left -- how unlucky are those on the Left
  56,10,The third to the fore shall be the foremost
  56,11,They shall be the nearest to God
  56,12,They will dwell in the Gardens of Bliss
  56,13,a large group of the early believers
  56,14,and a lesser number from the later generations
  56,15,Seated on couches wrought in gold and encrusted with precious stones
  56,16,reclining on them facing each other
