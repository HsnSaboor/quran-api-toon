quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun is folded up
  81,2,and when the stars lose their light
  81,3,and when the mountains are moved
  81,4,when ten-month pregnant camels are left untended
  81,5,and when all beasts are gathered together
  81,6,and when the seas are set on fire
  81,7,when the souls are divided into different classes
  81,8,and when the female infant buried alive is asked
  81,9,for what sin she was killed
  81,10,when the records of men's deeds are laid open
  81,11,when the sky is unveiled
  81,12,and when Hell is set ablaze
  81,13,when Paradise is brought close
  81,14,"[then] each soul shall know what it has put forward"
  81,15,I swear by the receding stars
  81,16,the planets that run their course and set
  81,17,and the night that falls
  81,18,and the first breath of morning
  81,19,"Truly, this is the word brought by a noble messenger"
  81,20,endowed with power and held in honour by the Lord of the Throne
  81,21,who is obeyed there and is worthy of trust
  81,22,Your companion is not one possessed
  81,23,"he truly beheld him [the angel] on the clear horizon"
  81,24,He is not avid of the Unseen
  81,25,Nor is this the word of an outcast devil
  81,26,So where are you going
  81,27,This is merely a reminder to all mankind
  81,28,to every one of you who wishes to tread the straight path
  81,29,"But you cannot will it unless God, the Lord of the Universe, so wills it [to show you that way]"
