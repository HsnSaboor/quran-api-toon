  47,31,"Most certainly We will try you until We have discovered those among you who strive their hardest, and those who are steadfast, and will test your record"
  47,32,"Surely, they who are bent on denying the truth and on barring [others] from the path of God, and oppose the Messenger when they have been shown guidance, cannot harm God in any way. He will cause all their deeds to come to nothing"
  47,33,"Believers, obey God and obey the Messenger: do not let your deeds go to waste"
  47,34,"surely those who reject the truth and bar others from the path of God, then die as deniers of the truth, will not be granted forgiveness by God"

  47,37,"If He were to ask it [wealth] of you, and continued to press you, you would be niggardly, and this would show your ill-will"
  47,38,"Behold! You are those who are called upon to spend for God's cause, but among you are those who are niggardly, and whoever stints does so against his own self. Indeed, God is self-sufficient, but you stand in need [of Him], and if you turn back, He will bring in your place another people, who will not be like you"
