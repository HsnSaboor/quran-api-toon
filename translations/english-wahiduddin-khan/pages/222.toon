  11,7,"Enthroned above the waters, it was He who created the heavens and the earth in six Days [periods], in order to test which of you is best in conduct. If you say, \"You will [all] be raised up after death,\" those who deny the truth will say, \"This is just sheer sorcery"

  11,12,"You may [feel the inclination] to leave aside a part of what is revealed to you and you may be distressed because they say, \"Why has no treasure been sent down to him, why has no angel come with him?\" But you are only to give warning. God is the guardian of all things"
