quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  7,160,"We divided them up into twelve tribes, each a whole community, and We revealed Our will to Moses, when his people asked for water, saying, \"Strike the rock with your staff.\" Twelve springs gushed from it and each tribe knew its drinking place. We caused the clouds to draw their shadow over them and sent down for them manna and quails, saying, \"Eat the good things We have given you.\" They did not wrong Us; rather it was themselves they wronged"
  7,161,"When they were told, \"Settle down in the town and eat wherever you wish in it, and pray for forgiveness and enter the gate in humility: We shall forgive you your sins and shall bestow further favours upon those who do good"
  7,162,the transgressors among them substituted something else for the word they had been given. So We sent them a punishment from heaven for their wrongdoing
  7,163,"Ask them about the town which was by the sea and what befell its people when they broke the Sabbath. On their Sabbath the fish came to them near the surface, but on week-days they never came near them -- thus We tried them because of their disobedience"
