  36,71,"Do they not see that, among the things which Our hands have fashioned, We have created for them cattle of which they are the masters"
  36,72,"We have subjected these to them, so that some may be used for riding and some for food"
  36,73,some for milk to drink and some from which other benefits may be received? Will they not be grateful
  36,74,"They have set up other gods besides God, hoping to be helped by them"
  36,75,"but they are not able to help them: rather they will be brought before God as their allied host"
  36,76,Let not their words grieve you. We have knowledge of all that they conceal and all that they reveal
  36,77,"Does not man see that We created him from a drop. Yet there he is, flagrantly contentious"
  36,78,"producing arguments against Us, and forgetting his own creation. He asks, \"Who can give life back to bones after they have rotted away"
  36,79,"Say, \"He who brought them into being in the first instance will give them life again: He has knowledge of every type of creation"
  36,80,He who produces fire for you from green trees and from this you kindle fire
  36,81,"Is He who created the heavens and earth not able to create others like these people? Of course He is! He is indeed the Supreme Creator, the All Knowing"
  36,82,"when He decrees a thing, He need only say, \"Be!\" and it is"
  36,83,So glory be to Him who has control over all things. It is to Him that you will all be brought back
