quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,54,"If every wrongdoer possessed all that was on the earth, he would seek to ransom himself with it: when they see the punishment, they will repent in secret. But judgement will be passed upon them in all fairness, and they will not be wronged"
  10,55,"Assuredly, everything that is in the heavens and on the earth belongs to God. Assuredly, God's promise is true. Yet most of them do not realize it"
  10,56,"He gives life and brings about death, and to Him you shall all return"
  10,57,"O mankind! There has come to you an admonition from your Lord, a cure for what is in the hearts, and a guide and a blessing to true believers"
  10,58,"Say, \"In the grace and mercy of God let them rejoice, for these are better than the worldly riches which they hoard"
  10,59,"Say, \"Have you considered the provision God has sent down for you, and have you made some of it unlawful and some lawful?\" Say, \"Has God given you permission [to do this], or are you inventing falsehoods about God"
  10,60,"What will they think, those who invent falsehoods about God, on the Day of Resurrection? God is bountiful to men: yet most of them are not grateful"
  10,61,"In whatever activity you may be engaged, and whichever part of the Quran you recite, and whatever deed you do, We are witness to it when you are engaged in it. Not the smallest particle on the earth or in heaven is hidden from your Lord; and there is nothing smaller or bigger but is recorded in a clear Book"
