quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  73,1,O you who are wrapped up in your mantle
  73,2,stand up to pray for much of the night
  73,3,It may be half the night or a little less than that
  73,4,"or a little more, but recite the Quran slowly and distinctly"
  73,5,For We are about to send down to you a message of considerable gravity
  73,6,"Surely, getting up at night [for worship] is the most potent means of subduing the self and most suitable for the word [of prayer]"
  73,7,"You have by day prolonged occupations [with Dawah work]"
  73,8,"Remember the name of your Lord, and devote yourself to Him wholeheartedly"
  73,9,"He is the Lord of the east and the west, there is no deity but Him, so take Him as your Guardian"
  73,10,"Bear patiently with what they say, and ignore them politely"
  73,11,"Leave it to Me to deal with the deniers, who live a life of comfort, and bear with them a little longer"
  73,12,We have in store for them heavy fetters and a blazing Fire
  73,13,food that chokes and painful punishment
  73,14,on the Day the earth and mountains shall shake and the mountains crumble into shifting sand dunes
  73,15,"We have sent a messenger who is a witness over you, just as We sent a messenger to Pharoah before you"
  73,16,"But Pharoah rebelled against the messenger, so We seized him with a strong, crushing grip"
  73,17,If you persist in denying the truth how will you escape the Day that will turn the children's hair grey
  73,18,The Day when the heavens will be rent asunder and God's promise shall be fulfilled
  73,19,"This, surely, is an admonition. So let him who will, take the right path to his Lord"
