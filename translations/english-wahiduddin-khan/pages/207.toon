quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,123,Believers! Fight against those deniers of the truth who are near you. Deal firmly with them. Know that God is with those who fear Him
  9,124,"Whenever a chapter is sent down, there are some of them who say, \"Which of you has had his faith increased by it?\" But, as for those who believe, it increases their faith and they rejoice"
  9,125,"but as for those with sickness in their hearts, it adds defilement to their defilement and they die in a state of denial of truth"
  9,126,"Do they not see that they are tried every year once or twice? Yet they do not repent, nor would they be admonished"
  9,127,"Whenever a chapter is revealed, they glance at each other, asking, \"Is anyone watching?\" Then they turn away. God has turned their hearts away, because they are people who do not understand"
  9,128,"There has come to you a Messenger of your own. Your suffering distresses him: he is deeply concerned for your welfare and full of kindness and mercy towards the believers"
  9,129,"But if they turn away, say, \"God suffices me: there is no deity but He: in Him I have put my trust. He is the Lord of the Glorious Throne"
