  43,24,"Each messenger said, \"What if I should bring you better guidance than what you found your forefathers had?\" They replied, \"We reject any message you have been sent with"
  43,25,"So We wreaked Our vengeance on them: now see what was the end of those who rejected [the Truth]"

  43,29,"Yes, I gave the good things of this life to these [men] and their fathers, until the truth came to them, and a messenger expounding things clearly"

  43,32,"Is it they who apportion the mercy of your Lord?

  43,33,"If it were not that all mankind might have become one community [of disbelievers], We could have given all those who deny the Lord of Mercy, houses with roofs of silver, silver staircases to ascend"
