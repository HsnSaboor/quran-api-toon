quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,109,"The Day when God assembles the messengers and asks them, \"What was the response you received [from the people]?\" they will reply, \"We have no knowledge of it. You alone know what is hidden"
  5,110,"Then God will say, \"Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favour to you and to your mother: how I strengthened you with the holy spirit, so that you could speak to people in childhood and in maturity; and how I taught you the Book, and wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel; how by My leave you fashioned from clay the shape of a bird and blew upon it, so that, by My leave, it became a bird, and healed the blind and the leper by My permission, and when you brought forth the dead by My permission; and how I prevented the Children of Israel from harming you when you came to them with clear signs, when those of them who denied the truth said, \"This is sheer magic"
  5,111,"[Remember the time], when I inspired the disciples to believe in Me and in My messenger, they replied, \"We believe, bear witness that we have submitted"
  5,112,"When the disciples said, \"O Jesus, son of Mary! Can your Lord send down to us from heaven a table spread with food?\" He replied, \"Have fear of God, if you are true believers"
  5,113,"They said, \"We want to eat from it, so that we may satisfy our hearts and know that you have told us the truth, and that we should be witnesses of it"
