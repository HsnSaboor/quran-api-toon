quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,His Lord called out to him by the sacred valley of Tuwa
  79,17,"[saying], \"Go to Pharaoh, he has exceeded all bounds"
  79,18,"and say, 'Will you reform yourself"
  79,19,"Do you want me to guide you to your Lord, so that you should fear Him"
  79,20,Moses showed him the great sign
  79,21,"but he denied it and refused [the faith]"
  79,22,Then he quickly turned his back
  79,23,And he summoned all his people
  79,24,"and proclaimed, \"I am your supreme Lord"
  79,25,but God seized him and meted out to him the chastisement of both the next world and the present
  79,26,surely there is in this a lesson for the God-fearing
  79,27,"[O Men!] Are you more difficult to create than the heaven which He has built"
  79,28,by raising its vault high and fashioning it flawlessly
  79,29,and making its night dark and bringing forth its morning light
  79,30,and the earth which He spread out
  79,31,after that bringing forth from it its water and its pasture land
  79,32,and making the mountains firm
  79,33,"[all this] as a means of sustenance for you and your animals"
  79,34,When the great over-whelming event arrives
  79,35,on the Day that man remembers what he strove for
  79,36,and Hell is there for all to see
  79,37,anyone who has acted arrogantly
  79,38,and prefers the life of this world
  79,39,will find himself in Hell
  79,40,but one who fears to stand before his Lord and restrained himself from base desires
  79,41,shall dwell in Paradise
  79,42,"They will ask you [Prophet] about the Hour, saying, \"When it will come to pass"
  79,43,what have you to do with the mentioning of it
  79,44,Your Lord alone knows when it will come
  79,45,you are but a warner for those who fear it
  79,46,"On the Day when they see it, they will feel as if they had tarried in this world for only one evening or one morning"
