quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,98,"Why was there no other people, save the people of Jonah, who should have believed so that their belief would have benefited them. Once they believed, We lifted the torment of shame from them during their worldly life and let them enjoy Our provision for a while"
  10,99,"Had your Lord pleased, all the people on earth would have believed in Him, without exception. So will you compel people to become believers"

  10,101,"Say, \"Look at whatever [exists] in heavens and on earth.\" But signs and warnings do not benefit the unbelievers"
  10,102,"What can they be waiting for but the punishment that came to those before them? Say, \"So wait; I am one of those waiting with you"
  10,103,Then We shall save Our messengers and those who believe. Thus We have made it incumbent upon Ourself to save the believers
  10,104,"Say, \"O people, if you are in doubt concerning my religion, then [know that] I do not worship those whom you worship instead of God, but rather I worship God who will cause you to die, for I am commanded to be one of the believers"
  10,105,"And set your face towards the [true] faith in all uprightness, and do not be one of those who ascribe partners to God"
  10,106,"and do not invoke besides God what can neither help nor harm you. If you do, you will be one of the wrongdoers"
