quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,"as they sit on couches, gazing around"
  83,36,"Have those who deny the truth [not] been paid back for their deeds"
  84,1,When the sky bursts open
  84,2,and obeys its Lord as it must
  84,3,when the earth flattens out
  84,4,and casts out all that is within it and becomes empty
  84,5,and obeys its Lord as it must
  84,6,"O man, having striven hard towards your Lord, you shall meet Him"
  84,7,he who is given his record in his right hand
  84,8,shall have an easy reckoning
  84,9,"and he shall return to his people, joyfully"
  84,10,but as for him whose record shall be given to him from behind his back
  84,11,he will pray for utter destruction
  84,12,and he will enter the blazing flame
  84,13,He used to be happy with his own people
  84,14,"for he never thought that he would have to return [to God]"
  84,15,But he will indeed! His Lord was ever watching him
  84,16,I swear by the glow of sunset
  84,17,by the night and what it covers
  84,18,and the moon when it grows full
  84,19,you will progress from stage to stage
  84,20,What is wrong with them that they do not believe
  84,21,"When the Quran is read to them, why do they not fall to their knees"
  84,22,"Indeed, those who are bent on denying the truth reject it"
  84,23,God is quite aware of what they are storing in their hearts
  84,24,"Therefore, give them the news of a painful punishment"
  84,25,But for those who believe and do good works; for them there shall be a never-ending reward
