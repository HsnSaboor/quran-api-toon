quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,So no intercession will avail them
  74,49,Then what is wrong with them that they turn away from admonition
  74,50,like frightened donkeys
  74,51,fleeing from a lion
  74,52,"Indeed, everyone of them desires to have sheets of revelations unfolded before them"
  74,53,No! They do not fear the Hereafter
  74,54,but this is truly a reminder
  74,55,Let him who will take heed
  74,56,"they will only take heed if God so wills: He is the Lord who is worthy to be feared: the Lord of forgiveness"
  75,1,By the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,and by the self-reproaching soul
  75,3,"Does man think that We cannot [resurrect him and] bring his bones together again"
  75,4,"Indeed, We have the power to restore his very finger tips"
  75,5,Yet man wants to deny what is ahead of him
  75,6,"he asks, \"When is this Day of Resurrection to be"
  75,7,"But [on that Day], when mortal sight is confounded"
  75,8,and the moon is eclipsed
  75,9,when the sun and the moon are brought together
  75,10,"on that Day man will ask, \"Where can I escape"
  75,11,But there is nowhere to take refuge
  75,12,"on that Day, to your Lord alone is the recourse"
  75,13,"On that Day, man will be told of all that he has sent before and what he has left behind"
  75,14,"Indeed, man shall be a witness against himself"
  75,15,in spite of all the excuses he may offer
  75,16,"[Prophet], do not move your tongue too fast in your attempt to learn this revelation"
  75,17,We Ourself shall see to its collection and recital
  75,18,"When We have recited it, follow its words attentively"
  75,19,"and then, it will be for Us to make its meaning clear"
