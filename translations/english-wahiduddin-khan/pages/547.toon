quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  59,10,"Those who came [into the faith] after them say, \"Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in the faith and leave no malice in our hearts towards those who believe. Lord, You are indeed compassionate and merciful"
  59,11,"Have you not seen those who act hypocritically? They say to their disbelieving companions from among the People of the Book, \"If you are driven out we shall surely go out with you, and we shall never listen to anyone against you, and if war is waged against you, we shall help you.\" God bears witness that they are indeed liars"
  59,12,"If they are driven out, they will not go with them, nor, if they are attacked, will they help them. Indeed, if they go to their help, they will turn their backs in flight, and then they will not be helped"
  59,13,"They are more in dread of you than of God, because they are people devoid of understanding"
  59,14,"They will never fight against you in a body except from within fortified strongholds or from behind walls. There is much hostility between them. You think they are united, but their hearts are divided, because they are a people devoid of reason"
  59,15,"Like those who went just before them, they have tasted the evil consequences of their doings. And they shall have a painful punishment"
  59,16,"They are like Satan, who says to man, \"Deny the truth!\" but when man denied the truth, said, \"I disown you; I fear God, the Lord of the Universe"
