quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,What are they asking each other about
  78,2,"About the awesome tidings [of resurrection]"
  78,3,concerning which they are in disagreement
  78,4,But they will soon come to know
  78,5,"Surely, they will soon find out the truth"
  78,6,Have We not spread the earth like a bed
  78,7,and raised the mountains like supporting poles
  78,8,We created you in pairs
  78,9,and gave you repose in sleep
  78,10,and the night as a cover
  78,11,and made the day for earning a livelihood
  78,12,We have built above you seven mighty heavens
  78,13,and We have set therein a glowing lamp
  78,14,From the rain clouds We send waters pouring down in abundance
  78,15,so that We may bring forth thereby grain and a variety of plants
  78,16,and gardens dense with foliage
  78,17,"Surely, the Day of Judgement has an appointed time"
  78,18,"On that Day when the trumpet shall be sounded, you shall come in droves"
  78,19,"and the heaven shall be opened, and become gates"
  78,20,"and the mountains shall be made to vanish, as if they had been a mirage"
  78,21,"Surely, Hell lies in wait"
  78,22,a home for the transgressors
  78,23,where they shall remain for ages
  78,24,and where they will taste neither coolness nor any drink
  78,25,save boiling water and a stinking fluid
  78,26,a fitting requital
  78,27,for they never expected to be called to account
  78,28,and they rejected outright Our signs
  78,29,but We have recorded everything in a Book
  78,30,"[So We shall say], \"Taste, then, [the fruit of your evil doings,] for now We shall bestow on you nothing but more and more suffering"
