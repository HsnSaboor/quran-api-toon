quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you? How do you form your judgement
  37,155,Will you not then reflect
  37,156,Or have you clear evidence
  37,157,"Then produce your scriptures, if you are telling the truth"
  37,158,"They claim that He has kinship with the jinn, yet the jinn themselves know that they will be produced before Him [for judgement]"
  37,159,God is far above what they attribute to Him
  37,160,but not so the true servants of God
  37,161,neither you nor what you worship
  37,162,can lure away from God any
  37,163,except those who will burn in Hell
  37,164,"[The angels say], \"Every single one of us has his place assigned"
  37,165,we are those who stand ranged in ranks
  37,166,We glorify God
  37,167,They say
  37,168,If we had had with us a Book like that of the people of old
  37,169,we would surely have been God's chosen servants
  37,170,"but they have rejected it, [the Quran] and they shall soon learn"
  37,171,"And surely Our word has gone forth respecting Our servants, the messengers"
  37,172,that it is certainly they who will be helped
  37,173,and that it is Our host that would certainly triumph
  37,174,So turn away from them for a while
  37,175,"Watch them: they will soon see"
  37,176,Do they really wish to hasten Our punishment
  37,177,"When it descends on their courtyards, how terrible that morning will be for those who were warned"
  37,178,So turn away from them for a while
  37,179,"And watch, for they will soon see"
  37,180,"Glory be to your Lord: the Lord of Glory is far above what they attribute to Him"
  37,181,Peace be upon the Messengers
  37,182,"and praise be to God, the Lord of all the Worlds"
