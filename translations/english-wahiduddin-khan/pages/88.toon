quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,60,"Have you not seen those who profess to believe in what has been revealed to you and [to other prophets] before you? They seek the judgement of evil people, although they were commanded not to obey them. And Satan wants to lead them far astray"
  4,61,"When they are told, \"Come to what God has sent down and to the Messenger,\" you see the hypocrites turn away from you"
  4,62,"How will it be when an affliction befalls them because of what they themselves have done? They will come to you, swearing by God, saying that they were seeking nothing but goodwill and conciliation"
  4,63,"But God knows all that is in their hearts; so ignore what they say, admonish them and speak to them in such terms as will address their minds"
  4,64,"All the messengers We sent were meant to be obeyed by God's leave. If they had come to you and sought forgiveness from God whenever they wronged themselves, and the Messenger had prayed for forgiveness for them, they would have found that God is ever-forgiving and merciful"
  4,65,"By your Lord, they will not be true believers until they seek your arbitration in their disputes and find within themselves no doubt about what you decide and accept it wholeheartedly"
