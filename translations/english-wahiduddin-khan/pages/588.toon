quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,Indeed! The record of the wicked is in the Sijjin
  83,8,and what could make you understand what the Sijjin is
  83,9,it is a written record
  83,10,"Woe, on that Day, to those who reject"
  83,11,those who deny the Day of Judgement
  83,12,No one denies it except for the evil aggressor
  83,13,"When Our revelations are conveyed to him, he says, \"Fables of the ancients"
  83,14,No! Their own deeds have cast a veil over their hearts
  83,15,Indeed! On that Day a barrier will be set between them and their Lord
  83,16,then they shall enter the Fire of Hell
  83,17,"and they will be told, \"This is what you were wont to belie"
  83,18,"But, the record of the righteous is [preserved] in the 'Illiyyin"
  83,19,and what will make you understand what the 'Illiyyin is
  83,20,a written record
  83,21,which those angels closest to God will bear witness to
  83,22,The virtuous will surely be in bliss
  83,23,seated on couches and gazing around in wonder
  83,24,You will find in their faces the brightness of bliss
  83,25,"They will be given a drink of pure wine, sealed"
  83,26,its seal will be of musk -- for this let the aspirants aspire
  83,27,a wine tempered with the waters of Tasnim
  83,28,a spring at which those drawn close to God will drink
  83,29,The wicked used to laugh at the believers
  83,30,"when they passed by them, they would wink at one another"
  83,31,"and when they returned to their own people, they would speak of them jestingly"
  83,32,"and when they saw them, they said [scornfully], \"These men have surely gone astray"
  83,33,though they were not sent to be their keepers
  83,34,"so today those who believe shall [be able to] laugh at those who denied the truth"
