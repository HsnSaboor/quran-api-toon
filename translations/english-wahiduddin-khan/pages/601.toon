quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,I swear by the passage of time
  103,2,that man is surely in a state of loss
  103,3,"except for those who believe and do good deeds and exhort one another to hold fast to the Truth, and who exhort one another to stead-fastness"
  104,1,Woe to every fault-finding back-biter
  104,2,"who amasses wealth, counting it over"
  104,3,thinking that his wealth will make him live forever
  104,4,By no means! He shall surely be cast into the crushing torment
  104,5,Would that you understood what that crushing torment is like
  104,6,It is a Fire kindled by God
  104,7,Reaching right into the hearts of men
  104,8,it closes in on them from every side
  104,9,in towering columns
  105,1,Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the people of the elephant
  105,2,Did He not foil their strategy
  105,3,and send against them flocks of birds
  105,4,which pelted them with clay stones
  105,5,Thus He made them like stubble cropped by cattle
