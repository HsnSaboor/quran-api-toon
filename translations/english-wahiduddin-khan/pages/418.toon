quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  33,1,"O Prophet, have fear of God and do not yield to those who deny the truth and the hypocrites. God is all-knowing and all-wise"
  33,2,Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord. God is aware of all that you do
  33,3,Put your trust in God; God is sufficient as a Guardian
  33,4,"God has not placed two hearts in any man's body, nor has He made your wives -- from whom you keep away by saying, \"Be as my mother's back\" -- your [real] mothers, neither He has made your adopted sons as your own sons. These are merely words which you utter with your mouths: but God speaks the truth and gives guidance to the right path"
  33,5,"Call them after their own fathers; that is closer to justice in the sight of God. If you do not know their fathers, regard them as your brothers in faith and your proteges. You will not be blamed if you make a mistake, you will be held accountable only for what in your hearts you have done intentionally. God is forgiving and merciful"
  33,6,"The Prophet has a higher claim on the believers than [they have on] their own selves, and his wives are their mothers. Blood relatives are closer to one another in God's Book than are believers and the Emigrants except that you want to show your friends a kindness. That is decreed in the Book"
