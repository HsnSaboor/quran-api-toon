quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,that this is indeed a noble Quran
  56,78,in a well-guarded preserved Book
  56,79,which none can touch except the purified
  56,80,It is a revelation sent down from the Lord of the worlds
  56,81,How can you regard this discourse with disdain
  56,82,Do you make its denial your means of livelihood
  56,83,"Why, then, when the soul of the dying man reaches the throat"
  56,84,"and you are [at that moment] looking on [helplessly]"
  56,85,"and We are nearer to him than you, although you cannot see Us"
  56,86,"why, then, if you are not subject to Our command"
  56,87,do you not cause the soul to return to him if you are truthful in your claim
  56,88,"But if he [the dying person] is one of those brought near to God"
  56,89,then for him there shall be comfort and plenty and a Garden of Bliss
  56,90,and if he is of those who are on the Right
  56,91,"he will be greeted with, \"Peace be to you,\" by those on the Right"
  56,92,"But if he is one of those who rejected [the truth] and went astray"
  56,93,he will be welcomed with boiling water
  56,94,He will burn in Hell
  56,95,This is indeed the indubitable truth
  56,96,"So glorify the name of your Lord, the Supreme"
  57,1,"Everything in the heavens and earth glorifies God -- He is the Mighty, the Wise One"
  57,2,He has sovereign control over the heavens and the earth. He gives life and brings death. He has power over all things
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last, the Outward and the Inward. He has knowledge of all things"
