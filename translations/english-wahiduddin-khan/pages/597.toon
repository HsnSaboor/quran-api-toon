quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the Fig and the Olive
  95,2,and by Mount Sinai
  95,3,and by this secure land
  95,4,We have indeed created man in the best of mould
  95,5,then We cast him down as the lowest of the low
  95,6,except for those who believe and do good deeds -- theirs shall be an unending reward
  95,7,"What then after this, can make you deny the Last Judgement"
  95,8,Is not God the greatest of the judges
  96,1,"Read! In the name of your Lord, who created"
  96,2,"created man from a clot [of blood]"
  96,3,Read! Your Lord is the Most Bountiful One
  96,4,who taught by the pen
  96,5,taught man what he did not know
  96,6,Yet man behaves arrogantly
  96,7,because he thinks himself self-sufficient
  96,8,"truly, all will return to your Lord"
  96,9,Have you seen one who prevents
  96,10,a worshipper from praying
  96,11,Do you think he is rightly guided
  96,12,or enjoins true piety
  96,13,Do you see how he has denied the truth and turned away from it
  96,14,Does he not know that God observes all things
  96,15,"Let him beware! If he does not desist, We will drag him by the forelock"
  96,16,"his lying, sinful forelock"
  96,17,Then let him call his associates
  96,18,We shall summon the guards of Hell
  96,19,"No indeed! Do not obey him, but prostrate yourself and come closer to God"
