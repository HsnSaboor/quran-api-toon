quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,32,"The haughty ones will then reply to the weak ones, \"Did we keep you away from the guidance when it came to you? Indeed not. You yourselves were the guilty ones"
  34,33,"Those deemed weak will say to those deemed great, \"No, it was your scheming night and day when you commanded us to reject God and assign equals to Him.\" But they will show their remorse when they see the punishment. We will put iron collars round the necks of those who had been bent on denying the truth. They will be requited only in proportion to their misdeeds"
  34,34,"For it has been thus whenever We sent a warner to any community. Its affluent ones said, \"We reject what you have been sent with"
  34,35,"They say, \"We have more wealth and children; and we are surely not going to be punished"
  34,36,"Say to them, \"My Lord increases the provision for whoever He pleases and decreases it for whoever He pleases; but most people do not know it"
  34,37,"It is not your wealth or your children that will confer on you nearness to Us. It is those who believe and act righteously who will be doubly rewarded for their good deeds, and will dwell in peace in the high pavilions [of paradise]"
  34,38,"while those who strive to thwart Our messages, seeking to defeat their purpose, shall be summoned to punishment"
  34,39,"Say to them, \"It is my Lord who increases the provision for such of His servants as He pleases, and decreases it for such of them as He pleases. Whatever you spend, He will recompense you for it. He is the best of providers"
