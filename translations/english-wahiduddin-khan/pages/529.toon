quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  54,7,"with downcast eyes they shall come out of their graves, as if they were locusts milling about"
  54,8,"hastening towards the Crier. Those who deny the truth will cry, \"This is such a hard day"
  54,9,"The people of Noah denied [the truth] before them. They belied Our messenger saying, \"He is mad!\" He was rebuffed"
  54,10,"so he cried out to his Lord, saying, \"I am overcome, so help me"
  54,11,So We opened the gates of the sky with water pouring down in torrents
  54,12,"and We caused the earth to burst with gushing springs: so that the waters met for a purpose which had been decreed"
  54,13,"We bore him on an [ark] which, made of planks and nails"
  54,14,"floated on under Our eyes: a vindication of him who had been rejected"
  54,15,"We have left this as a sign: but will anyone take heed"
  54,16,How terrible then was My punishment and My warning
  54,17,We have made it easy to learn lessons from the Quran. Is there anyone who would receive admonition
  54,18,The people of 'Ad too rejected the truth. How terrible was My punishment and My warning
  54,19,We sent a raging wind against them on a day of continuous calamity
  54,20,It swept people away as if they were trunks of uprooted palm trees
  54,21,"How [dreadful] was My punishment and My warning"
  54,22,"We have made it easy to learn lessons from the Quran: is there anyone who would receive admonition"
  54,23,The tribe of Thamud also rejected Our warnings
  54,24,"they said, \"Are we to follow a man from amongst ourselves? We would surely then fall into error and madness"
  54,25,"Has the [Divine] message been revealed to him alone of all of us? No, he is a boastful liar"
  54,26,"[We said to him] \"Tomorrow they shall know who is the boastful liar"
  54,27,"for We are [going to] send the she-camel as a trial for them, so watch them and be patient"
