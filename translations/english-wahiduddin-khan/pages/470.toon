quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,26,"Pharaoh said, \"Let me kill Moses, let him call upon his Lord, I fear that he may cause you to change your religion, or that he may cause disorder in the land"
  40,27,"Moses replied, \"I seek refuge with my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant person who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning"
  40,28,"A believer, a man from among the people of Pharaoh, who had concealed his faith, said, \"Would you slay a man merely because he says, \"My Lord is God.\" He has brought you clear signs from your Lord, and if he is lying, the sin of his will be on his own head; but if he is truthful, a part of that of which he warns you will surely befall you. Certainly, God does not guide one who is a transgressor and a liar"
  40,29,"My people! Yours is the kingdom today, you have dominion in the land; but who will help us against the scourge of God if it befalls us?\" But Pharaoh said, \"I point out to you only that which I consider right; and I guide you to the right path"
  40,30,"The believer said, \"My people! I fear for you a fate like that of the people of old"
  40,31,"like the fate of the people of Noah, 'Ad, Thamud, and those who came after them -- God never wills injustice on His creatures"
  40,32,"My people, I fear for you the Day you will cry out to one another"
  40,33,"the Day when you will [wish to] turn your backs and flee, having none to defend you against God: for he whom God lets go astray can never find any guide"
