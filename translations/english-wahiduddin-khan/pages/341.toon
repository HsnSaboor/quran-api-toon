quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  22,73,"People, here is an illustration. So listen carefully. Surely, those whom you invoke other than God cannot create even a fly, even if they were all to combine together to do it, and if a fly should snatch anything away from them, they cannot recover it from it. Both are indeed weak, the seeker and the sought"
  22,74,No just estimate have they made of God. Surely God is powerful and mighty
  22,75,God selects messengers from both angels and from mankind; God is all hearing and all seeing
  22,76,He knows what lies ahead of them and what is behind them. All things shall return to God
  22,77,"You who are true believers, kneel and prostrate yourselves, worship your Lord and do good works, so that you may succeed"
  22,78,"Strive for the cause of God as it behoves you to strive for it. He has chosen you and laid on you no burden in the matter of your religion, the faith of Abraham your forefather. In this, as in former scriptures He has given you the name of Muslims, so that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and so that you may be witnesses over mankind. Therefore, say your prayers regularly and pay the zakat and hold fast to God. He is your master. An excellent master and an excellent helper"
