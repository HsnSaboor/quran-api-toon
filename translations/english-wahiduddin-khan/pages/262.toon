  15,1,"Alif Lam Ra. These are the verses of a clear Book, the Quran"
  15,2,A time will surely come when those who are bent on denying the truth will wish that they had surrendered themselves to God
  15,3,"so leave them to eat and enjoy themselves and let them be beguiled by vain hopes; for soon they will realise [the truth]"
  15,4,We have never destroyed a township without a definite decree having been issued
  15,5,"no people can forestall their doom, nor can they delay it"
  15,6,"They say, \"You to whom the Reminder [the Quran] has been sent down, you are surely possessed"
  15,7,"Why do you not bring down the angels upon us, if you are truthful"
  15,8,But We send down the angels only to bring justice and then they will not be reprieved
  15,9,"It is We who have sent down the Reminder and We will, most surely, safeguard it"
  15,10,We sent messengers before you to the previous peoples
  15,11,but there was never a messenger who came to them but they mocked him
  15,12,"thus We cause this [habit of mocking] to enter into the hearts of the sinful"
  15,13,"They will not believe in it, though they have before them the example of former peoples"
  15,14,"and even if We opened to them a door from heaven, and they began ascending through it"
  15,15,"they would still say, \"Our eyes have been dazzled. We are bewitched"
