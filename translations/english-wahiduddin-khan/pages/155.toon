quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,38,"God will say, \"Enter the Fire and join the bands of jinn and men that have gone before you.\" Every time a host enters [the fire], it will curse its fellow-host, then, when they are all gathered there, the last of them will say of the first, \"Our Lord, it was they who led us astray: give them double punishment in the Fire,\" -- God will say, \"Every one of you will have double punishment, though you do not know it"
  7,39,"then the preceding one will say to the succeeding one: you are no better than us: so taste the punishment you have earned"
  7,40,The gates of Heaven shall not be opened for those who rejected Our signs and arrogantly spurned them; nor shall they enter Paradise until a camel shall pass through the eye of a needle. That is how We repay the evil-doers
  7,41,"Hell shall be their bed, and over them will be coverings of fire, thus shall We reward the wrongdoers"
  7,42,"But those who believed and did good deeds, and We do not burden any soul with more than it can bear, such are the heirs of the Garden and there they will remain forever"
  7,43,"And We shall remove whatever rancour may be in their hearts. At their feet shall flow rivers. And they shall say, \"All praise belongs to God who has guided us to this. Had God not guided us, we would never have found the way. The messengers of our Lord brought the Truth.\" A voice will call out to them, \"This is the Garden which you have inherited by your labours"
