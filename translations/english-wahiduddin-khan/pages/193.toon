  9,37,"The postponing of [sacred months] is but one more instance of [their] refusal to acknowledge the truth -- by which those who are bent on denying the truth are led astray.

Their evil deed seems fair to them: God does not guide those who deny the truth"
  9,38,"Believers, what is the matter with you that when you are asked to go forth in the cause of God, you cling slothfully to the land? Do you prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, compared to that of the Hereafter"
  9,39,"If you do not go forth, He will punish you sternly and replace you by other people. You will not harm Him in the least. God has power over all things"

God is powerful and wise"
