quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  58,22,"You will find no believers in God and the Last Day consorting with those who oppose God and His Messenger, even though they be their fathers, their sons, their brothers or their close relatives. He has engraved faith on their very hearts and has strengthened them with a spirit of His own. He will usher them into Gardens through which rivers flow where they shall dwell forever. God is well-pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him. They are God's party. God's party shall surely enter into a state of bliss"
  59,1,"Everything in the heavens and on the earth glorifies God. He is the Almighty, the All Wise"
  59,2,"It was He who turned those People of the Book who denied the truth out of their homes in the first banishment. You never thought they would go, and they thought their strongholds would protect them against God. But God came upon them from where they least expected and cast such terror into their hearts that their houses were pulled down by their own hands as well as by the hands of the believers. Learn a lesson, then, you who are endowed with insight"
  59,3,"If God had not prescribed exile for them, He would surely have punished them in this world. But they shall have the torment of Fire in the Hereafter"
