quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,6,"Believers, when you rise to pray, wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows and wipe your heads and [wash] your feet up to the ankles. If you are in a state of impurity, take a full bath. But if you are sick or on a journey or when you have just relieved yourselves, or you have consorted with your spouses, you can find no water, take some clean sand and rub your faces and hands with it. God does not wish to place any burden on you; He only wishes to purify you and perfect His favour to you, in order that you may be grateful"
  5,7,"Remember God's favour to you, and the covenant, which He made with you when you said, \"We hear and we obey.\" Fear God. God has full knowledge of the innermost thoughts of men"
  5,8,"Believers, be steadfast in the cause of God and bear witness with justice. Do not let your enmity for others turn you away from justice. Deal justly; that is nearer to being God-fearing. Fear God. God is aware of all that you do"
  5,9,God has promised those who believe and do good deeds forgiveness and a great reward
