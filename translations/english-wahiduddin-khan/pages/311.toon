  19,78,"Has he looked to the unseen, or has he made a pledge to the Merciful One"
  19,79,Indeed not. We shall record what he says and shall prolong the punishment for him
  19,80,"We shall inherit all that he boasts of, and he will come to Us all alone"
  19,81,"They have taken other deities besides God, so that they may be a source of strength for them"
  19,82,But they shall reject their worship and turn against them
  19,83,Do you not see that We have appointed devils to incite those who deny the truth to disobedience
  19,84,So take no hasty action against them; their days are numbered
  19,85,"The Day will surely come when We shall gather the God-fearing like [honoured] guests before the Compassionate God"

  19,90,"the heavens might well-nigh burst thereat, and the earth break asunder, and the mountains fall down in pieces"
  19,91,because they ascribe a son to the Gracious One
  19,92,It does not become the majesty of the Compassionate God to take to Himself a son
  19,93,there is none in the heavens or on the earth but shall return to the Merciful in utter submission
  19,94,He has counted them and numbered them precisely
  19,95,each one of them shall come to Him one by one on the Day of Judgement
