quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,80,"He who obeys the Messenger obeys God. As for those who turn away, know that We have not sent you to be their keeper"
  4,81,"They say: \"We obey you,\" but as soon as they leave you, a group of them plan together by night against what you say. God records whatever they scheme. So ignore them, and put your trust in God. God is sufficient as a trustee"
  4,82,"Do they not ponder on the Quran? If it had been from anyone other than God, they would have found much inconsistency in it"
  4,83,"When they hear any news, whether of peace or of something fearful, they spread it about; whereas if they referred it to the Messenger and to the men in charge, those of them who would have investigated it and could have arrived at the truth of the matter. But for God's grace and mercy, all but a few of you would have followed Satan"
  4,84,"So fight for the cause of God. You are responsible only for yourself. Urge on the believers. God may fend off the power [violence] of those who deny the truth, for He is stronger in might and stronger in inflicting punishment"
  4,85,"Whoever rallies to a good cause shall have a share in its blessing; and whoever rallies to an evil cause shall be answerable for his part in it: for, indeed, God watches over everything"
  4,86,"When you are greeted by anyone, respond with a better greeting or at least return it; God takes account of all things"
