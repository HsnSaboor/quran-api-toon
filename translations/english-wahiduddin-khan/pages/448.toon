quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"who used to ask, 'Do you really believe that"
  37,53,"after we die and become dust and bones, we shall be brought to judgement"
  37,54,"Then he will say, \"Shall we look for him"
  37,55,Then he will look and see him in the midst of the Fire
  37,56,"He will say, \"By God! You almost brought me to ruin"
  37,57,"If it had not been for the blessing of my Lord, I would also have been taken to Hell"
  37,58,"Then he will say [to his blessed companions], \"Are we not going to die"
  37,59,except for our first death? Are we not going to be punished
  37,60,"Truly, this is a great victory"
  37,61,It is for the like of this that all should strive
  37,62,Is that better by way of hospitality or the Zaqqum tree
  37,63,which We have made as a test for the wrongdoers
  37,64,For it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hellfire
  37,65,and its fruits are like devils' heads
  37,66,They will eat from it and fill their bellies with it
  37,67,then in addition to it they shall have a draught of boiling water to drink
  37,68,then surely they shall return to Hell
  37,69,They found their fathers had gone astray
  37,70,so they are rushing to follow in their footsteps
  37,71,And assuredly many of the ancients went astray before them
  37,72,though We had sent warners among them
  37,73,See how those who were warned met their end
  37,74,Not so the chosen servants of God
  37,75,"Noah cried to Us, and how excellent was Our response"
  37,76,We saved him and his people from great distress
