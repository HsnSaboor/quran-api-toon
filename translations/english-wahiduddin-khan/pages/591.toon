quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the heavens and that which comes in the night
  86,2,and what could make you know what it is that comes in the night
  86,3,It is the shining star
  86,4,"[for] no human being has been left unguarded"
  86,5,Let man reflect on what he was created from
  86,6,He was created from spurting fluid
  86,7,issuing from between the backbone and the breastbone
  86,8,He certainly has the power to bring him back to life
  86,9,On the Day when secrets are disclosed
  86,10,"[man] will have no power, and no helper"
  86,11,"By the heavens, ever-revolving"
  86,12,by the earth cracking open with new growth
  86,13,It is surely a decisive utterance
  86,14,and is not to be taken lightly
  86,15,They are planning a scheme
  86,16,and so am I
  86,17,"so bear with those who deny the truth, and let them be for a little while"
  87,1,"Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High"
  87,2,who created all things and gave them due proportions
  87,3,"who determines the nature [of all that exists], and guided it accordingly"
  87,4,who brings forth green pasture
  87,5,then turns it into black stubble
  87,6,"[O Prophet!] We shall make you recite the Quran so that you will not forget any of it"
  87,7,except whatever God wills; He knows both what is manifest and what is hidden
  87,8,We shall facilitate for you the Easy Way
  87,9,"Remind, if the reminder can be of benefit"
  87,10,"He who fears [God] will heed the reminder"
  87,11,but it will be ignored by the most unfortunate
  87,12,who will enter the Great Fire
  87,13,where he will neither die nor live
  87,14,He who purifies himself
  87,15,"who remembers the name of his Lord and prays, shall indeed be successful"
