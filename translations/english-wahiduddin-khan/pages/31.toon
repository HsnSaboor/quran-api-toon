quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,197,"The pilgrimage is in the appointed months. Whoever intends to perform it during them must abstain from indecent speech, from all wicked conduct, and from quarrelling while on the pilgrimage. Whatever good you may do, God is aware of it. Make provision for yourselves -- but surely, the best of all provision is God-consciousness. Always be mindful of Me, you that are endowed with understanding"
  2,198,"You will be committing no sin if [during the pilgrimage] you seek to obtain any bounty from your Lord. When you return from Arafat, remember God at the sacred place, and remember Him as He has guided you. Before this you were surely astray"
  2,199,Then press on from where the pilgrims stream forth and ask God's forgiveness. God is ever forgiving and most merciful
  2,200,"When you have performed the acts of worship prescribed for you, celebrate the praises of God as you celebrated the praises of your fathers, or even more fervently than that. There are some who say, \"Our Lord, give us abundance in this world.\" These shall have no share in the world to come"
  2,201,"But there are others who pray, \"Our Lord, grant us good in this world as well as good in the world to come, and protect us from the torment of the Fire"
  2,202,They shall have a good share from what they have earned. God is swift in His reckoning
