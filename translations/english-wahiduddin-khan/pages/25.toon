quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,164,"In the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the alternation of night and day; in the ships that sail the ocean bearing cargoes beneficial to man; in the water which God sends down from the sky and with which He revives the earth after its death, scattering over it all kinds of animals; in the courses of the winds, and in the clouds pressed into service between earth and sky, there are indeed signs for people who use their reason"
  2,165,"Yet there are some who set up equals with God and adore them with the adoration due to God, but those who believe love God most. If only the wrongdoers could see, as they will see when they face the punishment, that all power belongs to God, and that God is severe in punishment"
  2,166,"When they face their punishment, those who have been followed will disown their followers, and all their ties shall be cut asunder"
  2,167,"those who followed will say, \"If we could only return to the world, we would disown them as they have disowned us.\" God will thus show them their actions as a cause of bitter regret and remorse. They shall never emerge from the Fire"
  2,168,"O mankind, eat whatever is lawful and wholesome on the earth; and do not follow in the footsteps of Satan; for he is indeed your avowed enemy"
  2,169,He bids you only to do evil and to commit deeds of abomination and to attribute to God something of which you have no knowledge
