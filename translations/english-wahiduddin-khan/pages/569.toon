quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,though they shall be within sight of each other. The guilty one will gladly ransom himself from the torment of that Day by sacrificing his own children
  70,12,"his wife, his brother"
  70,13,and his kinsfolk who gave him shelter
  70,14,"and all the people of the earth, if that could deliver him"
  70,15,But no! There is a raging blaze
  70,16,stripping away his skin
  70,17,"and it will claim all those who turned their backs [on the true faith] and turned away [from the truth]"
  70,18,and amassed wealth and hoarded it
  70,19,"Indeed, man is born impatient"
  70,20,when misfortune touches him he starts lamenting
  70,21,"and whenever good fortune comes to him, he grows niggardly"
  70,22,But not so the worshippers
  70,23,who are steadfast in prayer
  70,24,those who give a due share of their wealth
  70,25,"to those who ask [for help] and to the destitute"
  70,26,and those who believe in the Day of Judgement
  70,27,and are fearful of the punishment of their Lord
  70,28,for none may ever feel secure from the punishment of their Lord
  70,29,those who preserve their chastity
  70,30,"except from their spouses and those whom they rightfully possess [through wedlock], for which they incur no blame"
  70,31,but those who go beyond that limit are transgressors
  70,32,and those who are faithful to their trusts and to their pledges
  70,33,and those who stand by their testimony
  70,34,and are steadfast in their prayers
  70,35,They will be honoured in the Gardens of Bliss
  70,36,"But what is the matter with those who deny the truth, that they come hastening towards you"
  70,37,"from the right and from the left, in crowds"
  70,38,Does every one of them aspire to be admitted into a Garden of Delight
  70,39,Certainly not! They know quite well out of what We created them
