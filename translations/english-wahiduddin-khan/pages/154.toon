  7,32,"Say, \"Who has forbidden the adornment of God, which He has brought forth for His servants and good things, clean and pure, which God has provided for His servants?\" Say, \"They are [lawful] for the believers in the present life but they shall be exclusively for them on the Day of Resurrection.\" Thus We explain Our signs for a people who understand"
  7,33,"Say,\"My Lord has forbidden indecency, both open and hidden, sin and wrongful oppression and that, without His sanction, you associate things with Him, and that you say things about Him without knowledge"

  7,36,"But those who deny and scorn Our revelations shall be the inmates of Hell, where they shall remain forever"
  7,37,"Who does a greater wrong than he who invents lies against God or rejects His revelations? Such people will have what has been decreed for them. And when Our messengers come to them to take away their souls, they shall ask them, \"Where are those you used to call upon besides God?\" They will answer, \"They have deserted us;\" and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers"
