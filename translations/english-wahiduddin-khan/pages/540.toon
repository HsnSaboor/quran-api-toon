quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  57,19,Those who believe in God and His messengers are the truthful ones and the witnesses in the sight of their Lord. They shall have their reward and their light. But those who are bent on denying the truth and reject Our signs shall be destined for Hell
  57,20,"Never forget that the life of this world is only a game and a passing delight, a show, and mutual boasting and trying to outrival each other in riches and children. It is like the growth of vegetation after the rain, which delights the planter, but which then withers away, turns yellow and becomes worthless stubble. In the life to come there will be a terrible punishment, or God's forgiveness and approval: the life of this world is nothing but means of deception"
  57,21,"Vie with one another for your Lord's forgiveness and for a Paradise as vast as heaven and earth, which has been made ready for those who believe in God and His messengers. Such is God's grace. He bestows it upon whoever He pleases. There is no limit to God's bounty"
  57,22,"No misfortune can affect the earth or your own selves without its first having been recorded in a book, before We bring it into being. That is easy for God to do"
  57,23,"so that you may not grieve for what has escaped you, nor be exultant over what you have gained. God loves neither the conceited nor the boastful"
  57,24,"nor those who, being miserly themselves, urge others to be miserly. He who turns his back should remember that God alone is self-sufficient and worthy of all praise"
