quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  38,62,"Then they will say to one another: \"But why do we not see those whom we deemed wicked"
  38,63,and whom we use to ridicule? Or has our eyesight failed to notice them
  38,64,"Surely, this is the very truth: the people in the hellfire will argue just like that"
  38,65,"O Prophet, tell them: \"My mission is only as a Warner; there is no divinity except Allah, the One, the Irresistible"
  38,66,"the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, the Almighty, the Forgiver"
  38,67,"Say: \"This is a supreme message"
  38,68,yet you pay no heed to it
  38,69,"Also say: \"I have no knowledge of that time when the exalted chiefs disputed among themselves"
  38,70,I am informed about all this through a revelation because I am assigned the mission of a plain Warner
  38,71,"Behold when your Lord said to the angels: \"I am about to create a man from clay"
  38,72,"then when I have fashioned him and breathed of My spirit into him, kneel down and prostrate yourselves before him"
  38,73,Accordingly all the angels prostrated themselves
  38,74,except Iblees; he acted arrogantly and became one of the disbelievers
  38,75,"Allah said: \"O Iblees! What prevented you from prostrating yourself to the one whom I have created with My own hands? Are you too arrogant, or do you think that you are one of the exalted ones"
  38,76,"Iblees said: \"I am better than him: You created me from fire and created him from clay"
  38,77,"Allah said: \"Get out of here: for you are accursed"
  38,78,and My curse shall be on you till the Day of Judgment
  38,79,"Iblees said: \"O Lord! Then give me respite till the Day of Resurrection"
  38,80,"Allah said: \"Well, you are given respite"
  38,81,till the Day of Appointed Time
  38,82,"Iblees said: \"I swear by Your Honor, I will mislead them all"
  38,83,except your chosen sincere devotees among them
