quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,When His Lord called him in the sacred valley of Tuwa
  79,17,"and said: \"Go to Pharaoh for he has indeed transgressed all bounds"
  79,18,"and tell him, `Have you the desire to purify yourself"
  79,19,"If so, I shall guide you towards your Lord, so that you may fear Him"
  79,20,Then Moses showed Pharaoh the mighty sign
  79,21,but he denied and disobeyed
  79,22,Then he quickly turned back
  79,23,assembled his people and made a proclamation
  79,24,"I am your lord, the most high"
  79,25,"Consequently, Allah seized him for punishment, both in the Hereafter and in this life"
  79,26,Surely in this there is a lesson for the Godfearing
  79,27,"O mankind, is your creation harder than the heaven that He built"
  79,28,He raised its canopy and fashioned it to perfection
  79,29,He gave darkness to the night and brightness to the day
  79,30,After that He spread out the earth
  79,31,then from it He brought forth its water and its pasture
  79,32,set its mountains
  79,33,and made them beneficial for you and your cattle
  79,34,When the great disaster will strike
  79,35,the Day when man will call to mind all that he had striven for
  79,36,When hell shall be placed in full view of all
  79,37,then he who had rebelled
  79,38,and preferred the life of this world
  79,39,shall have his abode in hell
  79,40,But he who had feared standing before his Lord and curbed his evil desires
  79,41,shall have his home in paradise
  79,42,"They ask you about the hour: \"When will it come"
  79,43,But it is not for you to know or tell its timing
  79,44,Only your Lord knows when it will come
  79,45,You are but a Warner to him who fears it
  79,46,"On that Day when they shall see it, they shall feel as if they had stayed in this world only one evening or one morning"
