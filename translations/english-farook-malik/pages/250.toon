quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  13,6,"They ask you to hasten on the evil rather than the good, although there have been instances of exemplary punishments before them. In fact your Lord is the Lord of Forgiveness to the people, notwithstanding their wrongdoing; and it is also the fact that your Lord is stern in retribution"
  13,7,"The unbelievers say: \"Why is not a sign sent down to him (Muhammad) from his Lord?\" You are nothing but a Warner and every nation was assigned a guide"
  13,8,Allah knows what every female bears in her womb. He is fully aware of what decrease or increase (miscarriage or a long wait) takes place in the womb. Everything has a due measure with Him
  13,9,"He has perfect knowledge of both the visible and the invisible. He is the Great, the Most High"
  13,10,"It is the same to Him whether any of you speak in secret or aloud, whether anyone hides under the darkness of night or walks about in broad daylight"
  13,11,"Each person has been assigned guardian angels before him and behind him, who watch him by the command of Allah. The fact is that Allah never changes the condition of a people until they intend to change it themselves. If Allah wants to afflict a people with misfortune, none can ward it off, nor they can find any protector besides Him"
  13,12,"He is the One Who shows you lightning, which causes fear and hope, and brings up heavy clouds"
  13,13,The thunder declares His glory with His praises and so do the angels with awe. He sends thunderbolts and smites with them whomever He wants. Yet these unbelievers dispute concerning Allah; He is mighty in strength
