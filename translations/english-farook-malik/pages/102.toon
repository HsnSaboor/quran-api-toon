  4,150,"Those who deny Allah and his Messenger and those who intend to draw a line between Allah and His Messengers saying: \"We believe in some, and reject the rest\" - desiring to take a middle way between belief and unbelief"
  4,151,these are the real unbelievers and We have prepared for such unbelievers a humiliating punishment

  4,153,"The People of the Book ask you to bring down for them a book from Heaven. From Moses they demanded an even harder miracle than that. They asked him: \"Make us see Allah with our own eyes.\" As a result of their wickedness, the thunderbolt overtook them. Then they took the calf for worship after receiving clear revelations. After all that, We still pardoned them and gave to Moses clear authority"
  4,154,We lifted the mount of Tur over them and took the covenant from them that they will obey Our commandments. On another occasion We commanded them to enter the gates prostrating in humility. Yet on another occasion We commanded them not to transgress in the matter of the Sabbath and took a solemn commitment from them
