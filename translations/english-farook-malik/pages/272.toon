quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  16,43,"The Messengers We sent before you, O Muhammad, and to whom We revealed Our Message, were also human beings. You (O people of Mecca), may ask those who have the Reminder (The people of the Book), if you don’t know this fact yourself"
  16,44,"We sent those Messengers with clear signs and scriptures; and now We have sent down the reminder to you (O Muhammad), so that you may explain clearly to mankind as to what was sent to them so that they may think about it"
  16,45,Do those who plot evil deeds feel secure that Allah will not cave in the earth beneath them or that the scourge will not come to them from directions that they did not suspect
  16,46,Or that He may not seize them in the course of their journey leaving no way for their escape
  16,47,"Or that He may seize them after alerting them about the danger? Yet your Lord is Beneficent, Merciful"
  16,48,"Do they not see how every object that Allah has created casts its shadow right and left, prostrating itself to Allah in all humility"
  16,49,"To Allah prostrate all the creatures of the heavens and the earth, including the angels; and they are not arrogant"
  16,50,"they fear their Lord Who is above them, and they do whatever they are commanded to do"
  16,51,"Allah has commanded: \"You shall not worship two gods: there exists only One God, I am the One Whom you should fear"
  16,52,To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth and His Deen (laws or ways of life) is followed in the universe - would you then fear any one other than Allah
  16,53,"Whatever blessings you enjoy are from Allah, and when touched by distress, He is the One to Whom you cry for help"
  16,54,Yet no sooner does He relieve you from the distress than some of you begin to associate others with Him
