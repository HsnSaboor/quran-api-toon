quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,as they recline on couches and gaze at them
  83,36,Have not the unbelievers been fully rewarded for what they used to do
  84,1,When heaven will split asunder
  84,2,obeying her Lord’s command as she ought to
  84,3,When the earth will spread out
  84,4,and cast out all that is within her and becomes empty
  84,5,obeying her Lord’s command as she ought to
  84,6,"O mankind! Surely you must strive towards your Lord, a hard striving, then you shall meet Him"
  84,7,Then he who will be given his Book of deeds in his right hand
  84,8,shall have a quick and easy reckoning
  84,9,and shall return to his people rejoicing
  84,10,But he who will be given his book of deeds from behind his back
  84,11,shall soon be calling for death
  84,12,and shall be made to enter a blazing fire
  84,13,for he used to live happily with his kinfolks
  84,14,and thought that he would never return to Allah for accountability
  84,15,"Yet, surely his Lord was ever watching"
  84,16,I swear by the glow of sunset
  84,17,by the night and all that it gathers together
  84,18,"by the moon, when she grows full"
  84,19,that you shall gradually pass from one stage to another
  84,20,What is the matter with the people that they do not believe
  84,21,"and when the Qur’an is recited to them, they do not prostrate"
  84,22,Nay! The unbelievers will deny
  84,23,and Allah knows what they are hiding in their hearts
  84,24,"Therefore, proclaim to them a painful punishment"
  84,25,except those who embrace the true faith and do good deeds; for them there will be a never ending reward
