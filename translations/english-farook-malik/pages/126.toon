quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,109,"On the Day of Resurrection when Allah gathers the Messengers and asks: \"What response were you given from your addressees?\" They will say: \"We have no knowledge, only You have all the knowledge of the unseen"
  5,110,"Then Allah will ask: \"O Jesus son of Mary! Recall my favor upon you and to your mother, how I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit, so you could speak to the people in cradle and in old age, how I taught you the Book, Wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel. How you were able to make the figure of a bird out of a clay, by My permission, how you breathed into it and changed it into a real bird, by My permission. How you could heal the born-blind and the lepers by My permission. How you could bring the dead body back to life by My permission. How I protected you from the violence of the Children of Israel when you came to them with clear signs and the unbelievers among them said: \"This is nothing but a clear sorcery"
  5,111,"Remember, when I inspired the disciples to have faith in Me and My Messenger and they said: ‘We believe and bear witness that we have become Muslims"
  5,112,"How when the disciples asked: \"O Jesus, son of Mary! Can your Lord send down to us from heaven a table spread with food?\" And you said: \"Have fear of Allah if you are true believers"
  5,113,"They said: \"We only wish to eat thereof to satisfy our hearts and to know that you have indeed told us the truth, and that we bear witness to it"
