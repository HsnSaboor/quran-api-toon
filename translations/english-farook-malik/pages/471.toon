quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  40,34,"Do you remember that a long time before this, Joseph came to you with clear signs, but you ever remained in doubt concerning to what he brought; and when he died you said: 'After him, Allah will never send another Messenger.' Thus Allah confounds the ones who are the doubting transgressors"
  40,35,who dispute the revelations of Allah having no authority vouchsafed to them. Such an attitude is disgusting in the sight of Allah and of the believers. Thus Allah seals up the heart of every arrogant transgressor
  40,36,"After hearing this, Pharoah said: \"O Haman! Build me a high tower that I may attain the means of access"
  40,37,"an access to the heavens, so that I may see the God of Moses, I am convinced that he is lying.\" Thus Pharoah was seduced by his foul deeds and he turned away from the Right Way. The schemes of Pharoah led him to nothing but destruction"
  40,38,"The man who was a true believer, said: \"O my people! Follow me, I shall guide you to the Right Way"
  40,39,"O my people! The life of this world is only temporary enjoyment, while the abode of hereafter is everlasting"
  40,40,"The one who does evil shall be recompensed to the extent of the evil done; and the one who is a believer and does good deeds, whether man or woman, shall enter the paradise and therein receive sustenance without measure"
