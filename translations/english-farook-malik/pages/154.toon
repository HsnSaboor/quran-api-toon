quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  7,31,"O Children of Adam! Put on your adornment (proper and decent dress) when you attend your Masjid at the time of every prayer. Eat and drink, but do not be extravagant; surely He does not love the extravagant"
  7,32,"O Muhammad, ask them: \"Who has forbidden you to wear decent clothes or to eat the good food which Allah has provided for His devotees?\" Say: \"All these things are for the enjoyment of the believers in the life of this world though shared by others; but these shall be exclusively theirs on the Day of Resurrection. Thus do We make Our revelations clear for those who understand"
  7,33,"Say: \"My Lord has forbidden all indecencies whether open or secret, sin and rebellion against justice, committing shirk with Allah for which He has granted no sanction, and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge"
  7,34,"For every nation there is a fixed term, when their term expires, it can neither be delayed for a moment nor can it be made to come early"
  7,35,"O children of Adam! Whenever there come to you Messengers from among you and recite to you My revelations, those who will become righteous and mend their ways will have nothing to fear or to regret"
  7,36,"but those who deny Our revelations and treat them with arrogance, shall be the inmates of hellfire to live therein forever"
  7,37,"Who can be more unjust than the one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His revelations? Such people will have their destined portion from the Book (what was written for them to receive during their life on earth); until when Our messengers (angels of death) arrive to take away their souls, they will ask: \"Where are those gods whom you used to invoke besides Allah?\" They will reply: \"They have forsaken us\" and they will bear witness against themselves (admit) that they were indeed kuffar (unbelievers)"
