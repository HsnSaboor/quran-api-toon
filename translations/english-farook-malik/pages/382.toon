quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  27,56,"But his people gave no answer except that they said: \"Drive out the family of Lot from your city: they pose to be very pious"
  27,57,"So, We delivered him and his family except his wife - about whom We had decreed that she shall be of those who will remain behind"
  27,58,"and We rained down on them a shower of brimstones, and evil was the rain which fell on those who were forewarned"
  27,59,"Say: \"Praise be to Allah and peace be on His servants whom He has chosen to deliver His message. Ask them: \" Who is better? Allah or the deities they associate with Him"
  27,60,"Is not He (Allah), Who has created the heavens and the earth, sends down rain from the sky and with it brings forth the beautiful gardens not better than the false gods that they worship? It is not in your ability to cause the growth of trees for those gardens. Is there another god besides Allah who could do that? No doubt they are a people who have swerved from justice in ascribing equals to Him"
  27,61,"Just think who has made the earth a place for your residence, caused in it the rivers to flow, set mountains upon it and placed a barrier between the two seas? Is there another god besides Allah? Nay, most of them have no knowledge"
  27,62,"Just think who answers the oppressed person when he cries out to Him and relieves his affliction, and makes you, O mankind, inheritors of the earth? Is there another god besides Allah? How little do you reflect"
  27,63,"Just think who guides you in darkness on the land and the sea, and who sends the winds as heralds of good news of His mercy? Is there another god besides Allah? Exalted be Allah above what they associate with Him"
