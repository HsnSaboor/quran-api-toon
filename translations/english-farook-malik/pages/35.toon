quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,220,"this world and the hereafter. They ask you about orphans. Tell them: \"It is best to deal with them justly; you may become copartners with them, after all they are your brethren; Allah knows who means harm and also who means their welfare. If Allah had wanted He could be hard on you in this matter, surely Allah is Mighty, Wise"
  2,221,"Do not marry pagan women until they become believers; a believing slave woman is better than a free pagan woman even though she may be more attractive to you. Likewise, do not marry pagan men until they become believers: a believing slave is better than a free pagan even though he may be more pleasing to you. These pagans invite you to the hellfire while Allah invites you towards paradise and forgiveness by His grace. He makes His revelations clear to mankind so that they may take heed"
  2,222,"They ask you about menstruation. Tell them: \"This is a discomfort; therefore, keep away from women (do not have sexual intercourse) during their menstrual periods and do not approach them until they are clean again. When they have cleansed themselves then you may approach them in the manner Allah has enjoined for you. Surely Allah loves those who turn to Him in repentance and keep themselves clean"
  2,223,"Your wives are your tilth; so go to your tilth when you like. Take care of your future and refrain from the displeasure of Allah. Bear in mind that you shall meet Him in the Hereafter, and give good news to the believers"
  2,224,"Do not use Allah's name in your oaths as an excuse to prevent you from dealing justly, guarding against evil and making peace between people; Allah hears and knows everything"
