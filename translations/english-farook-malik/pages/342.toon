quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,Indeed successful are those believers
  23,2,who are humble in their Salah (prayers)
  23,3,who avoid vain talk
  23,4,who are punctual in the payment of Zakah (charity)
  23,5,who guard their private parts
  23,6,"except with their spouses or those who are legally in their possession, for in that case they shall not be blamed"
  23,7,however those who seek to go beyond that in lust are the ones who shall be the transgressors
  23,8,who are true to their trust and covenants
  23,9,and who are diligent about their Salah (prayers)
  23,10,These are the heirs
  23,11,who will inherit paradise; and live therein forever
  23,12,Indeed We have created man from an essence of clay
  23,13,then placed him as a drop of semen in a firm resting place
  23,14,"then changed the semen into a leechlike mass, then leechlike mass into a fetus lump, then fetus lump into bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, and then We brought him forth as quite a different creature from the embryo - so blessed is Allah, the best of all creators"
  23,15,Then after living for a while you shall all die
  23,16,then most surely you shall be raised to life again on the Day of Resurrection
  23,17,We have made seven avenues (heavens) above you; and We are never unmindful of Our creation
