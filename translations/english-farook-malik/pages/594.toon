quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  89,24,"He will say: \"Alas! Would that I had sent forth some good deeds for this life of mine"
  89,25,None can punish as Allah will punish on that Day
  89,26,and none can bind as He will bind
  89,27,"To the righteous soul it will be said: \"O fully satisfied soul"
  89,28,"Return to your Lord, well pleased with Him and well-pleasing to Him"
  89,29,Join My servants
  89,30,and enter My paradise
  90,1,I swear by this city
  90,2,(where to assassinate) you (O Muhammad) have been made lawful in this city
  90,3,And I swear by your father (Adam) and the children he begot (mankind)
  90,4,certainly We have created man to be in stress
  90,5,Does he think that none has power over him
  90,6,"He may boast: \"I have squandered wealth in abundance"
  90,7,Does he think that no one observes him
  90,8,Have We not given him two eyes to observe
  90,9,One tongue and two lips to control it
  90,10,Then shown him the two high ways (good leading towards paradise and evil leading towards hell)
  90,11,Yet he does not attempt to tackle the Aqabah (steep path)
  90,12,And what will explain to you what the Aqabah is
  90,13,It is the freeing of a neck (slave) from bondage
  90,14,or the giving of food in a day of famine
  90,15,to an orphan relative
  90,16,or to a needy in distress
  90,17,"besides this, he should be of those who believe, enjoin fortitude, encourage kindness and compassion"
  90,18,Such are the people of the right hand (going towards paradise)
  90,19,"But those who disbelieve Our revelations, they are the people of the left hand (going towards hell)"
  90,20,having fire all around them
