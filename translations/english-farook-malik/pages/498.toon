  44,42,Surely the Zaqqum tree
  44,43,shall be the food of the sinners
  44,44,it will be like the dregs of oil. Which shall boil in the belly
  44,45,like the boiling of scalding water
  44,46,"A voice will be heard: \"Seize him and drag him into the depth of the hell"
  44,47,then pour scalding water over his head
  44,48,"then the voice will say: \"Taste it; you were such a powerful noble"

  44,55,"There, in full peace, they shall call for every kind of fruit"
  44,56,"and after having prior death in the world, they shall taste death no more; and He (Allah) will protect them from the torment of hell"
