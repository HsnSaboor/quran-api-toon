quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,128,"If a woman fears cruelty or desertion from her husband, there is no blame if both of them agree to reconcile by means of a compromise, after all compromise is better. Human souls are prone to narrow- mindedness, but if you show generosity and fear Allah in your dealings, surely Allah is well aware of your actions"
  4,129,"It is not possible for you to do justice between your wives even if you wish to do so; therefore, in order to comply with Divine Law, do not lean towards one wife to the extent that you leave the other hanging in air. If you work out a friendly understanding and fear Allah, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  4,130,"If the spouses do separate, Allah will make each one independent of the other out of His own limitless resources, Allah is Amplegiving, Wise"
  4,131,"To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth. We directed the People of the Book before you and now direct you also, to fear Allah in your dealings with one another. But if you disobey ( you will do so at your own risk) for Allah owns all that is in the Heavens and in the Earth and Allah is Self-sufficient, Praiseworthy"
  4,132,Yes! To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth and Allah is sufficient as a Protector
  4,133,"If He wanted He could destroy you all, O mankind, and bring others. Allah has the power to do so"
  4,134,"Anyone who desires the reward of this world should know that Allah possesses the rewards of both, this world and the hereafter. Allah hears all and sees all"
