quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  27,14,"They were convinced in their hearts about the truth of those miracles, yet they denied those signs in their wickedness and pride. So you see, what was the end of those transgressors"
  27,15,"We bestowed knowledge on Davidand Solomon. They both said: \"Praise be to Allah Who has exalted us above many of His believing servants"
  27,16,"Solomon succeeded David. He said: \"O people! We have been taught the language of birds and given all sort of things. This is indeed a great blessing from Allah"
  27,17,"Solomon gathered an army comprised of Jinns, men and birds; they all were kept under strict discipline"
  27,18,"Once in an expedition he was marching with his army when they came across a valley of ants, one of the ants said: \"O ants, get into your habitations lest Solomon and his army crush you under their feet without even noticing it"
  27,19,"So Solomon smiled, laughing at its statement, and said: \"O Lord! Inspire me to render thanks for Your favors, which You have bestowed on me and on my parents, to do such good deeds that will please You; and admit me, by Your mercy, among Your righteous servants"
  27,20,"He took a roll call of the birds and said: \"I do not see the hoopoe, where is he? How could he be absent"
  27,21,"I will certainly punish him severely or even slay him, if he does not offer me a reasonable excuse for his absence"
  27,22,"The hoopoe, who did not take long in coming, said: I have just found out that which you do not know. I have brought you reliable information about the people of Sheba"
