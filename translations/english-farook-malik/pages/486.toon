quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  42,23,"Such a blessing is the good news which Allah gives to His servants who believe and do good deeds. O Prophet, say to them: \"I do not ask you any recompense except your love for being my close relatives.\" He that does a good deed shall be repaid many times over. Surely Allah is oft-Forgiving, most-Appreciative"
  42,24,"Do they say: \"He has forged a falsehood against Allah?\" But if Allah so willed, He could have sealed your heart. In fact Allah blots out falsehood and vindicates the truth by His words. Surely He knows everything that is hidden in your breast"
  42,25,"It is He Who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons their sins, and He knows whatever you do"
  42,26,"He answers the prayers of those who believe and do good deeds and gives them even more out of His bounty. As for the unbelievers, they shall have severe punishment"
  42,27,"Had Allah bestowed abundance upon His servants, they would have transgressed beyond bounds in the earth; that’s why He sends down in due measure as He pleases; He is well aware and observant of His servants"
  42,28,"It is He Who sends down rain even after they have lost all hope, and spreads His Mercy. He Alone is the Praiseworthy Guardian"
  42,29,"Among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the living creatures that He has spread in both of them: and He is capable of gathering them all together whenever He wants"
  42,30,Whatever affliction befalls you is the result of what your own hands have done even though for many of your misdeeds He grants forgiveness
  42,31,You cannot frustrate anything in earth and there is no protector or helper for you besides Allah
