quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  25,3,"Yet the unbelievers have taken besides Him other gods which can create nothing but are themselves created, which can neither harm nor help even themselves, and which have no power over life or death, or raising the dead to life"
  25,4,"Those who deny the Truth say: \"This Al-Furqan (The Qur'an) is but a forgery which he (Muhammad) himself has devised and some other people have helped him.\" Unjust is what they do and falsehood is what they utter"
  25,5,"And they say: \"These are the stories of the ancients which he has copied down from what is read to him day and night"
  25,6,"Tell them: \"This (The Qur'an) is revealed by Him Who knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth; surely He is Ever- Forgiving, Merciful"
  25,7,"And they say: \"What sort of Messenger is he who eats food and walks through the streets? Why has no angel been sent down with him to threaten the disbelievers"
  25,8,"Why has he not been given a treasure or at least a garden from which he could eat?\" And these wicked people further say: \"You are only following a man who is bewitched"
  25,9,See what sort of examples they apply to you! Because they are lost and cannot find the way to refute the truth of Tawhid and life after death

  25,11,"But in fact they deny the Hour - and for the one who denies the coming of the Hour, We have prepared a blazing fire"
