quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Surely your Lord knows that you stand in prayers nearly two- thirds of the night, and sometimes one-half or one-third of it, so do others among your companions. Allah has the measures of the night and the day. He knows that you will not be able to keep it up, so He has turned to you in Mercy, therefore, read from the Qur’an as much as you easily can. He knows that there may be some sick people among you, and some others who travel through the land to seek Allah’s bounty; and yet some others fighting for the cause of Allah. Therefore, read as much of the Qur’an as you easily can. Establish the Salah (five time daily prayers) and pay the Zakah (poor due), and give to Allah a goodly loan. Whatever good you will send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, which will be much better and greater in reward. Seek Allah’s forgiveness, surely Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  74,1,O Muddaththir (the one enveloped - one of the nicknames of Prophet Muhammad)
  74,2,Stand up and warn
  74,3,Proclaim the greatness of your Lord
  74,4,purify your clothes
  74,5,keep yourself away from uncleanliness
  74,6,do not favor others to expect a gain
  74,7,and be patient for the sake of your Lord
  74,8,When the Trumpet will be sounded
  74,9,that Day will be a very difficult Day
  74,10,not easy for the disbelievers
  74,11,"Leave Me and the one (Walid bin Mughirah, a staunch opponent of the Prophet) whom I created, alone"
  74,12,I gave him abundant resources
  74,13,thriving sons
  74,14,and made his life smooth and comfortable
  74,15,Yet he hopes that I shall give him more
  74,16,By no means! Because he has stubbornly denied Our revelations
  74,17,Soon I shall make him suffer mounting calamities
