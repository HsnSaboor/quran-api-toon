quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"When it is said to them: \"Come, the Messenger of Allah will pray for your forgiveness,\" they shake their heads and you see them turning away with arrogance"
  63,6,"It is the same, whether you pray for their forgiveness or not, Allah is not going to forgive them. Surely Allah does not guide the transgressors"
  63,7,"They are the same people who say: \"Do not give anything to those who follow the Messenger of Allah until they have deserted him.\" To Allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the hypocrites cannot understand"
  63,8,"They say: \"When we return to Medina, the honorable ones will soon drive out the mean ones.\" But the honor belongs to Allah, to His Messenger and to the believers; but the hypocrites do not know"
  63,9,"O believers! Let neither your riches nor your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. Those who will do so, it is they who shall be the real losers"
  63,10,"Spend, in charity and in the Cause of Allah, out of the sustenance which We have bestowed on you before that time when death will come to anyone of you, and he shall say: \"O my Lord! If only you would reprieve me for a little while then I would give out everything in charity, and be among the righteous"
  63,11,But Allah reprieves no soul when its term comes to an end. Allah is well aware of all your actions
