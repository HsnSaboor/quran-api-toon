quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,15,"If any of your women are guilty of fornication, ask for four reliable witnesses from among yourselves against them; and if they testify and their guilt is proved, confine them to their houses until they die or Allah opens some other way out for them"
  4,16,"And the two, whether married or unmarried, who are guilty of this offense, punish them both. If they repent and mend their ways, leave them alone. Surely Allah is the Acceptor of Repentance, Merciful"
  4,17,"Repentance with Allah (right to be forgiven by Allah) is only for those who do something evil in ignorance and repent as soon as they realize it; Allah will pardon them. Allah is the Knowledgeable, Wise"
  4,18,"There is no repentance for those who persist in their evil deeds until death approaches anyone of them and he says: \"surely now I repent.\" Similarly, there is no repentance for those who die while they were still unbelievers; for them We have prepared a painful punishment"
  4,19,"O believers! It is not lawful for you consider women as a part of your inheritance and retain them against their will in order that you may force them to give up a part of the dowry you have given them, unless they are guilty of proven fornication. Treat them with kindness even if you dislike them; it is quite possible that you dislike something in which Allah has placed much good"
