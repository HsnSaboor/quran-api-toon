quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  7,12,"Allah said: \"What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?\" He replied: \"I am better than he; you created me from fire and him from clay"
  7,13,"Allah said: \"Get down from here. You have no right to brag here of your superiority. Get out, henceforth you are of the petty ones"
  7,14,"Satan requested: \"Give me respite till the Day of Resurrection"
  7,15,"Allah said: \"The respite you requested is hereby granted"
  7,16,"Satan declared: \"Since You let me deviate, now I will lie in ambush for mankind on Your Right Way"
  7,17,"I Will come upon them from the front, from the rear, from the right, and from the left, and You will not find most of them to be grateful"
  7,18,"Allah said: \"Get out from here, you despicable outcast; I will certainly fill hell with you and all of them who follow you"
  7,19,"Allah said: \"O Adam! Dwell with your wife in paradise and eat any fruit you please; but never approach this tree or you shall both become wrongdoers"
  7,20,"But Satan tempted them so that he might reveal to them the private parts of their bodies which they had never seen before. He told them: \"Your Lord has forbidden you to approach this tree only to prevent you from becoming angels or immortals"
  7,21,"And he swore to them both: \"I am your sincere adviser"
  7,22,"Thus he cunningly seduced them, and when they ate from the tree, their shame became visible to them and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden. Then their Lord called out to them: \"Did I not forbid you to approach that tree, and did not I warn you that Satan was your open enemy"
