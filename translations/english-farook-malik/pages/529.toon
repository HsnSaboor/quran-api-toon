  54,11,So We opened the gates of heaven with pouring rain
  54,12,"and caused the earth to burst with gushing springs, and the waters met to fulfill the decreed end"
  54,13,We carried him in an Ark built with planks and nails
  54,14,"which drifted on under Our care: a reward for him (Noah) who was denied by the unbelievers"
