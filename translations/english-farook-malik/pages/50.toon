quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,1,Alif L'am M'im
  3,2,"Allah! There is no god but Him; the Living, the Eternal"
  3,3,"He has revealed to you this Book with the Truth, confirming the scripture which preceded it, as He revealed the Torah and Gospel"
  3,4,"before this, as a guidance for mankind and also revealed this Al-Furqan (criterion for judgment between right and wrong). Surely those who reject Allah’s revelations will be sternly punished; Allah is Mighty, capable of retribution"
  3,5,For sure nothing in the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allah
  3,6,"It is He Who shapes your bodies in the wombs of your mothers as He pleases. There is no god but Him; the Mighty, the Wise"
  3,7,"He is the One Who has revealed to you the Book. Some of its verses are decisive they are the foundation of the Book - while others are allegorical. Those whose hearts are infected with disbelief follow the allegorical part to mislead others and to give it their own interpretation, seeking for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allah. Those who are well grounded in knowledge say: \"We believe in it; it is all from our Lord.\" None will take heed except the people of understanding"
  3,8,"They say: \"Our Lord, do not let our hearts deviate from the truth after you have guided us, and grant us Your own mercy; You are the Grantor of bounties without measure"
  3,9,"Our Lord, You will surely gather all mankind before You on the Day about which there is no doubt; surely Allah does not break His promise"
