quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,103,And when they both submitted to Allah and Abraham laid down his son prostrate upon his forehead for sacrifice
  37,104,"We called out to him: \"O Abraham stop"
  37,105,"You have fulfilled your vision.\" Thus do We reward the righteous"
  37,106,That was indeed a manifest test
  37,107,We ransomed his son for a great sacrifice
  37,108,and We left his good name among the later generations
  37,109,SaLotation to Abraham
  37,110,Thus We reward the righteous
  37,111,Surely he was one of Our believing devotees
  37,112,We gave him the good news of Isaac - a prophet - one of the righteous
  37,113,We blessed him and Isaac both. Among their progeny there are some who are righteous and some who are clearly doing wrong to their own souls
  37,114,We bestowed Our favor on Moses and Haroon
  37,115,We delivered them with all their people from the mighty distress
  37,116,We helped them so they became victorious
  37,117,We gave them the Glorious Book (Torah)
  37,118,and guided them both to the Right Way
  37,119,We left their good names among the later generations
  37,120,SaLotation to Moses and Haroon
  37,121,Thus do We reward the righteous
  37,122,Surely they were two of Our believing devotees
  37,123,Ilyas (Elias) was surely one of Our Messengers
  37,124,"Behold, he said to his people: \"Have you no fear of Allah"
  37,125,Would you invoke Bal (their invented god) and forsake the best of the Creators
  37,126,Allah - Who is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers
