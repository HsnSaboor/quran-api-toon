  70,14,"and all that is in the earth, in ransom to save himself"
  70,15,By no means! It will be the fire of hell
  70,16,eager to pluck out his skull
  70,17,it will be calling all those who try to escape and turn their back
  70,18,who collected wealth and withheld it
  70,19,"Indeed, man has been created impatient"
  70,20,"when evil befalls him, he becomes despondent"
