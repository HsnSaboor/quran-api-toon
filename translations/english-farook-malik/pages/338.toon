quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  22,47,"These people ask you to hasten the threatened punishment. Well, Allah will never go back on His promise. In fact a day of your Lord (time period in which Allah's decision is executed) is equal to a thousand years of your calculation"
  22,48,"There have been many townships teeming with wrong doings, to whom at first I gave respite and at the end I smote them. Towards Me is the destination of all"
  22,49,"O Muhammad, tell them: \"O mankind! I am merely a plain Warner to you"
  22,50,Those who accept the true faith and do good deeds shall be forgiven and provided honorable sustenance
  22,51,"but those who strive against Our revelations, shall be the inmates of flaming fire"
  22,52,"Never have We sent a Messenger or a prophet before you, O Muhammad, with whose wishes Satan did not tamper; but Allah abrogates the interjections of Satan and confirms His own revelations, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"

  22,54,"so that those who are endowed with knowledge may realize that this (Qur’an) is the Truth from your Lord and thus believe in it and humble their hearts towards Him, and surely Allah will guide the believers to the Straight Way"
  22,55,"As for the unbelievers, they will never cease to doubt the revelation, until the Hour of Doom overtakes them suddenly or there comes on them the punishment of the Day of Disaster"
