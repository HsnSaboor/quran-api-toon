quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,44,"O Muhammad, you were not present on the western side of the mountain when We gave Moses the Law, nor did you witness that event"
  28,45,"We raised many generations and a long time has passed over them; you were not living among the people of Madyan, reciting to them Our revelations; but it is We Who are sending to you the news of that time"
  28,46,"Nor were you at the side of the mountain of Tur when We called out to Moses, but it is your Lord’s mercy that you are being given this information so that you may forewarn a nation to whom no Warner had come before you. Maybe they will take heed"
  28,47,"so that they may not be able to say, when a disaster befalls them on account of their misdeeds: \"Our Lord, had You sent us a Messenger, we should have followed Your revelations and become the believers"
  28,48,"Now that the Truth has come to them from Us, they are saying: \"Why is he (Muhammad) not given the like of what was given to Moses?\" Have they not rejected that which was given to Moses before? They claim: \"These (Torah and Qur’an) are the two works of sorcery complementing each other!\" And they say: \"We believe in neither"
  28,49,"Ask them: \"Bring a Book from Allah which is a better guide than these two, I will follow it, if what you say be true"
  28,50,"So if they do not meet this demand, you should know that they only follow their own desires. And who is more misguided than the one who follows his own desires rather than the guidance from Allah? In fact, Allah does not guide such wrongdoing people"
