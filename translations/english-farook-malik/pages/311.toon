quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Have you noticed the words of that person who rejects Our Revelations yet boasts: \"I shall always be given wealth and children"
  19,78,Has he gained knowledge of the Unseen or has he been awarded a contract by the Compassionate (Allah)
  19,79,By no means! We write down what he says and We will make his punishment long and terrible
  19,80,"We will inherit all that he boasts of, and he will come back to Us all alone leaving all these things behind"
  19,81,"They have taken other deities for worship besides Allah, so that they should be a source of strength to them"
  19,82,By no means! Those very deities will renounce their worship and turn against them
  19,83,Don’t you see that We have sent down to the unbelievers Satans who incite them against the Truth
  19,84,"Therefore be not in haste against them, their days are numbered"
  19,85,The Day will surely come when We will gather the righteous like honored guests before the Compassionate (Allah)
  19,86,and drive the criminals to Hell like thirsty cattle are driven to water
  19,87,None shall have the power to intercede except the one who may receive the sanction of the Compassionate (Allah)
  19,88,"Those who say: \"The Compassionate (God) has begotten a son"
  19,89,certainly preach such a monstrous falsehood
  19,90,"that the very Heavens might crack, the earth might cleave asunder and the mountains might crumble to pieces"
  19,91,at their ascribing a son to the Compassionate (God)
  19,92,It is not befitting to the Compassionate (God) that He should beget a son
  19,93,There is none in the heavens and in the earth but must come to the Compassionate (Allah) in full submission
  19,94,He has a comprehensive knowledge and has kept strict count of all His creatures
  19,95,and every one of them will come to Him individually on the Day of Resurrection
