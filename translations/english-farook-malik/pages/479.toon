quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  41,21,"And they will ask their skins: \"Why did you testify against us?\" Their skins will reply: \"Allah Who gives the faculty of speech to everything, has made us speak. He is the One Who created you to begin with, and now to Him you are being brought back"
  41,22,"During your life on earth you use to hide yourselves while committing crimes, you never thought that your own ears, your own eyes and your own skins would ever testify against you. Rather you thought that even Allah had no knowledge of many things that you do"
  41,23,"This thought of yours, which you entertained concerning your Lord, has brought you to destruction and now you have become of those who are utterly lost"
  41,24,"Then, whether they have patience or not, the fire will still be their home, and even if they beg for pardon, it shall not be granted to them"
  41,25,"We have assigned intimate companions, of like nature, for them Who make their past and present seem fair to them; and the same word (sentence of punishment) proved true against them, which overtook generations of jinn and men who have gone before them, that they shall surely be in loss"
  41,26,"The disbelievers say: \"Do not listen to this Qur’an and make noise when it is recited so that you may gain the upper hand"
  41,27,We will certainly punish the disbelievers and requite them for the worst of their misdeeds
  41,28,"hell that is, the reward for such enemies of Allah, which will be their eternal home: a reward for their denying Our revelations"
  41,29,"Wherein, the disbelievers will say: \"Our Lord! Show us those among jinns and mankind who misled us: we shall trample them under our feet so that they become utterly disgraced"
