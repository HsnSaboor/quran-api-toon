quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  22,73,"O mankind! Here is an example for your understanding, so listen to it carefully. Those deities whom you call besides Allah, cannot create a single fly, even if they all combined their forces, rather, if a fly snatches away anything from them they cannot even get it back; how feebleminded are the suppliants and how powerless are those whom they supplicate"
  22,74,"They do not render to Allah the homage due to Him; in fact, Allah is the One Who is All-Powerful, All-Mighty"
  22,75,"Allah chooses His messengers from among the angels and from among the human beings, for surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing"
  22,76,"He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and to Allah shall all matters return for decision"
  22,77,"O believers! Bow down, prostrate yourselves, worship your Lord and do good deeds so that you may attain salvation"
  22,78,"Strive in the Way of Allah as you ought to strive with sincerity and discipline; He has chosen you and has not laid upon you any hardship in the observance of your faith - the faith of your father Abraham. He named you Muslims before in prior scriptures and in this (The Qur’an), so that His Messenger may testify against you and you yourselves may testify against rest of the mankind. Therefore, establish Salah, pay Zakah and hold fast to Allah, Who is your Protector - so what an excellent Protector and what a splendid Supporter"
