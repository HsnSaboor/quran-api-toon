quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,82,"When Our Judgement came to pass, We turned the cities upside down and rained down on them brimstones of baked clay, layer upon layer"
  11,83,specially marked by your Lord. Such scourge is not far off from the wrongdoers
  11,84,"To the people of Median We sent their brother Shu’aib. He said: \"O my people! Worship Allah, you have no god but Him. Do not give short measure and weight. Although I see you in prosperity today, I fear for you the scourge of a Day that will encircle you"
  11,85,O my people! Give full measure and weight in all fairness. Do not defraud people of their goods and do not spread mischief in the land
  11,86,"What remains with Allah is better for you if you are true believers, and I am not set up as a guardian over you"
  11,87,"They said: \"Oh Shu’aib! Does your Salah (prayer) command you that we give up all those deities whom our forefathers worshipped or that we have no right of doing what we like with our own goods? For sure, you are the only gracious and righteous man left in the land"
  11,88,"He said: \"O my people! You see, if I have a clear sign from my Lord and He has given me good sustenance from Himself how can I, then, be a party to your evil and unlawful practices? I do not want to oppose you in what I am forbidding you. I desire nothing but to reform so far as I can manage. My success in this task depends entirely on the help of Allah; in Him do I trust and to Him do I turn for everything"
