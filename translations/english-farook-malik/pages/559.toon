quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  65,6,"Let those women, during their waiting period (‘Iddat), live where you yourselves live according to your means. You shall not harass them so as to make life intolerable for them. If they are pregnant, maintain them until their delivery: and if, after that, they suckle your offspring, compensate them and settle the matter of compensation with mutual consultation and in all fairness. But if you cannot bear with each other then let another woman suckle the baby for you"
  65,7,"Let the rich man give according to his means, and the poor man give according to what Allah has given him. Allah does not charge a man with more than He has given him; soon Allah may bring ease after hardship"
  65,8,How many townships have rebelled against the commandments of their Lord and His Messengers! Stern was Our reckoning with them and exemplary was Our punishment
  65,9,"So they tasted the fruit of their misdeeds, and the fruit of their misdeeds was perdition"
  65,10,"Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment. Therefore, fear Allah! O men of understanding and faith. Allah has indeed sent down to you an admonition"
  65,11,"a Messenger reciting to you the revelations of Allah containing clear guidance, so that he may lead the believers who do good deeds from the darkness to the light. He that believes in Allah and does good deeds, shall be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever; and Allah has prepared an excellent provision for them"
  65,12,"It is Allah Who has created seven heavens, and earths as many. His commandment descends through them, so that you may know that Allah has power over all things, and that Allah encompasses all things in His knowledge"
