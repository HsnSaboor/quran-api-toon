quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,90,"O believers! Intoxicants and gambling (games of chance), dedication to stones (paying tribute to idols) and division by arrows (lottery) are the filthy works of Satan. Get away from them, so that you may prosper"
  5,91,Satan desires to stir up enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah and from Salah (prayers). Will you not abstain
  5,92,"Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and abstain from these things. If you do not, then you should know that Our Messenger’s duty is only to pass on My message clearly"
  5,93,"There is no blame on those who believe and do good deeds for what they ate in the past, provided they abstain from those things which have been made unlawful, then remain steadfast in their belief and do righteous deeds, then abstain themselves from whatever they are forbidden and believe in Divine Law, and then fear Allah and do good deeds. For Allah loves those who do good deeds"
  5,94,"O believers! Allah will put you to trial by making game (that which is to be hunted) well within the reach of your hands and your spears in order to see who fears Him, though unseen. There shall, therefore, be a painful punishment for those who transgress after this warning"
  5,95,"O believers! Do not kill game while you are in Ihram (pilgrim garb). If anyone kills game intentionally, he will have to pay a penalty through an offering brought to the Ka’bah of a domestic animal equivalent to the one which was killed as determined by two just men among you; or as an expiation, either feed a few indigent or fast their equivalent days, so that he may taste the evil consequences of what he did. Allah has forgiven what happened in the past; but if anyone repeats it now, Allah will inflict retribution on him. Allah is Mighty, Capable of Retribution"
