quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,Today he neither has a true friend here
  69,36,nor any food except the pus from the washing of wounds
  69,37,which none but the wrongdoers eat
  69,38,Nay! I swear by all that you can see
  69,39,and all that you cannot see
  69,40,that this is the word of a noble Messenger
  69,41,It is not the word of a poet - little is it that you believe
  69,42,nor is it the word of a soothsayer - little admonition is that you take
  69,43,This is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
  69,44,Had he (Muhammad) invented false statements concerning Us
  69,45,We would certainly have seized him by his right hand
  69,46,then cut off his main artery
  69,47,and none of you could prevent it
  69,48,Surely this Qur’an is a reminder to the Godfearing
  69,49,We know that there are some among you who deny it
  69,50,and for such disbelievers it is indeed a cause of despair
  69,51,Yet surely it is the absolute truth
  69,52,"So glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High"
  70,1,A questioner asked you about the punishment which is bound to happen
  70,2,It is for the disbelievers and there is none to avert it
  70,3,"It will come from Allah, the Owner of the Ways of Ascent"
  70,4,The angels and the Spirit ascend to Him in a Day the measure of which is fifty thousand years
  70,5,"Therefore, endure with graceful patience"
  70,6,They see it (Day of Judgment) to be far-off
  70,7,but We see it quite near
  70,8,"On that Day, the sky shall become like molten brass"
  70,9,and the mountains like tufts of wool
  70,10,even a close friend will not ask of his friend
