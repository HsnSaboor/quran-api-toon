quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,46,"Then in the footsteps of those Prophets, We sent Jesus the son of Mary confirming whatever remained intact from the Torah in his time, and gave him the Gospel wherein was guidance and light, corroborating what was revealed in the Torah; a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah"
  5,47,"Therefore, let the people who follow the Gospel judge by the Law which Allah has revealed therein; those who do not judge by the Law which Allah has revealed, they are the transgressors"
  5,48,"To you, O Muhammad, We have revealed this Book with the truth. It confirms whatever has remained intact in the scriptures which came before it and also to safeguard it. Therefore, judge between people according to Allah’s revelations and do not yield to their vain desires, diverging from the truth which has come to you. We have ordained a law and a Way of life for each of you. If Allah wanted He could have made all of you a single nation. But He willed otherwise in order to test you in what He has given you; therefore try to excel one another in good deeds. Ultimately you all shall return to Allah; then He will show you the truth of those matters in which you dispute"
  5,49,"So, O Muhammad, pronounce Judgment among them according to the law which Allah has revealed and do not follow their vain desires, and beware of them lest they tempt you away from a part of that which Allah has revealed to you. If they reject your Judgment, then know that it is Allah’s wish to scourge them for some of their sins. In fact most of the people are transgressors"
  5,50,By rejecting the Divine Law do they wish to be judged by the laws of ignorance? Who is a better Judge than Allah for those who believe in Him
