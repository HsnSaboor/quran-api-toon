quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,158,"Are they waiting for the angels or your Lord to come down to them or are they waiting to be given a certain sign of your Lord! On the Day when that certain sign of your Lord appears, the belief will not profit that soul which did not believe before, or who, while professing to believe did not do good deeds. Say to them: \"Wait if you will; we too are waiting"
  6,159,"Surely those who divide the religion into sects and identify themselves as a sect, O Muhammad, you have nothing to do with them. Their case will be called to account by Allah Himself, He will inform them as to what they did"
  6,160,"Whoever does one good deed, he will be given credit for ten similar good deeds, and whoever does one bad deed will be punished for only one, and no one will be treated unjustly"
  6,161,"O Muhammad, tell them: \"As for me, surely my Lord has guided me to the Right Way, the ever true Deen, the faith of Abraham the upright and he was not of the pagans"
  6,162,"Also declare: \"Surely my Salah, my devotion, my life, and my death are all for Allah the Lord of the Worlds"
  6,163,He has no peer; thus am I commanded and I am the first of the Muslims
  6,164,"Say: \"Should I seek another Lord besides Allah when He is the Lord of everything?\" Every soul will reap the fruits of its own deeds; no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another. Ultimately you will return to your Lord, and He will resolve for you your disputes"
  6,165,"He is the One Who has made you the inheritors of the earth and raised some of you in ranks over others so that He may test you in what He has given you. Surely your Lord is swift in retribution; yet He is also very Forgiving, Merciful"
