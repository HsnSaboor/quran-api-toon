  18,84,Indeed We established his power in the land and We gave him all kinds of ways and means
  18,85,So one time he followed a certain expedition towards the West and he marched on
  18,86,"till he reached the end of the land and the start of an ocean, where the Sun was setting, he noted that it was setting in a mucky spring and found by it a people. We said: \"O Zul-Qarnain! You have the option to either punish them or to show them kindness"
  18,87,"He said: \"Anyone Who will do wrong shall be punished; then will he return to his Lord and be sternly punished by Him"
  18,88,"As for him who believes and does good deeds, he will have a good reward and will be assigned an easy task by our command"
  18,89,Then he set out on another expedition towards the East and marched on
  18,90,"till he came to the rising of the Sun, he noted it rising on a people for whom We had not provided any shelter from it (they were so backward that they did not even know how to make houses or tents for their living)"
  18,91,"He left them as they were: We had full knowledge what priority was before him"
  18,92,Then he set out on another expedition and marched on
  18,93,till he reached between two mountains where he found a people who could hardly understand his language
  18,94,"They requested: \"O Zul-Qarnain! People of Gog and Magog ravage this land; should we pay you tribute in order for you to build a wall-barrier between us and them"
  18,95,"Zul-Qarnain said: \"That which my Lord has granted me is more than enough, just help me with worker-force and I will erect a fortified barrier between you and them"
  18,96,"Bring me panels of iron.\" Finally when he had dammed up the space between the two mountains, he said: \"Ply your bellows.\" They did so until the iron wall became red hot, then he said: \"Bring me some molten brass to pour over it"
  18,97,This became such a barrier that Gog and Magog could not scale it or to dig through it
