quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,29,"After completing the term of his agreement, when Moses was travelling with his family, he saw a fire in the direction of Mount Tur. He said to his family: \"Stay here, I saw a fire and I hope to bring some information from there or a lighted torch with which you may warm yourselves"
  28,30,"But when he reached there, a voice called out to him from the right side of the valley of the blessed spot from a tree , saying: \"O Moses, surely I am Allah the Lord of the Worlds"
  28,31,"Then Allah commanded, \"Throw down your staff.\" When Moses saw that the staff was writhing like a snake, he turned his back and fled, and did not even look behind. Allah said, \"O Moses, come back and do not fear; you are quite safe"
  28,32,"Now put your hand into your pocket: it will come out shining white without any harm to you -whenever you feel afraid, draw your hand towards yourself to ward off fear - these are two credentials from your Lord towards Pharoah and his chiefs, surely they are wicked people"
  28,33,"Moses submitted: \"Lord! I have killed one of them: I fear that they will put me to death"
  28,34,"My brother Haroon (Aaron), he is more eloquent in speech than I: send him with me as a helper to confirm my words; I fear that they will treat me as a liar"
  28,35,"Allah replied: \"We will certainly strengthen your arm with your brother and give both of you such authority that they shall not be able to harm you. Now proceed with Our signs. You, and those who follow you, will surely triumph"
