  35,8,"Can that person be guided whose evil deeds are so fair seeming to him that he considers them good? The fact is that Allah leaves to stray whom He wills and guides whom He pleases. Therefore, O Prophet, let not your soul expire in sorrow on their account. Allah is aware of all their actions"
  35,9,"It is Allah Who sends forth winds to raise up the clouds, then drives them to a dead land and therewith revive the earth after its death. Similar will be the resurrection of the dead"
  35,10,"If anyone is seeking honor, let him know that all honor belongs to Allah Alone. Good words ascend to Him and good deeds are exalted by Him. As for those who plan evil deeds, they shall have severe punishment and their plots will be brought to nothing"
