quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,and there shall wait on them the eternal youths
  56,18,"with goblets, shining beakers and cups of pure wine"
  56,19,which will neither pain their heads nor take away their senses
  56,20,They shall have fruits of their own choice
  56,21,and flesh of fowls that they may desire
  56,22,and dark eyed Huris (damsels)
  56,23,as lovely as well guarded pearls
  56,24,as a reward for their good deeds that they had done
  56,25,There they shall not hear any vain talk nor sinful words
  56,26,"but only the greetings of \"Peace be upon you! Peace be upon you"
  56,27,Those of the right hand - happy shall be those on the right hand
  56,28,They shall be among the thornless lote trees
  56,29,clusters of bananas
  56,30,extended thick shades
  56,31,constantly flowing water
  56,32,abundant fruits
  56,33,of unforbidden never ending supply
  56,34,and will be reclining on high raised couches
  56,35,We shall create their wives of special creation
  56,36,and make them virgins
  56,37,"beloved by nature, equal in age"
  56,38,for those of the right hand
  56,39,Many of them will be from the former
  56,40,and many from the later generations
  56,41,As for those of the left hand - how unfortunate will be the people of the left hand
  56,42,They will be in the midst of scorching winds and in boiling water
  56,43,in the shade of a pitch-black smoke
  56,44,neither cool nor refreshing
  56,45,For they lived in comfort before meeting this fate
  56,46,They persisted in heinous sins
  56,47,"and used to say: \"When we are dead and turned to dust and bones, shall we then be raised to life again"
  56,48,"And our forefathers, too"
  56,49,"Tell them: \"Surely those of old and those of present age"
  56,50,shall certainly be brought together on an appointed time of a known Day
