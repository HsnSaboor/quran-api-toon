quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  36,13,Narrate to them the example of the people of a certain town to whom the Messengers came
  36,14,"At first We sent to them two Messengers, but when they rejected both, We strengthened them with a third and they all said: \"Surely we have been sent to you as Messengers"
  36,15,"But the people replied: \"You are but humans like us. The Compassionate (Allah) has revealed nothing; you are surely lying"
  36,16,"They said: \"Our Lord knows that we have indeed been sent as Messengers towards you"
  36,17,and our only duty is to convey His message plainly
  36,18,"The people replied: \"We regard you as an evil omen for us. Desist, or we will either stone you or you will receive from us a painful punishment"
  36,19,"They said: \"Your evil omens lie within yourselves. Do you say this because you are being admonished? Indeed you are a nation of transgressors"
  36,20,"In the meantime a man came running from the remote part of the City and said: \"O my people! Follow these Messengers"
  36,21,Follow the ones who ask no reward of you and are rightly guided
  36,22,It would not be justifiable on my part if I do not worship Him Who has created me and to Whom you shall be brought back
  36,23,"Should I take other gods besides Him? If the Compassionate (Allah) should intend to harm me, their intercession will avail me nothing, nor will they be able to save me"
  36,24,"If I do so, I would indeed be in manifest error"
  36,25,"Surely I believe in your Lord, so listen to me"
  36,26,"Consequently they killed that man and it was said to him: \"Enter paradise.\" He exclaimed: \"Would that my people knew that what I know"
  36,27,How my Lord has granted me forgiveness and included me among the honored ones
