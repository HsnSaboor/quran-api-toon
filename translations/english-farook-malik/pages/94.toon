quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,"Those believers who stay at home - having no physical disability - are not equal to those who make Jihad (struggle) in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their persons. Allah has granted a higher rank to those who make Jihad with their wealth and their persons than to those who stay at home. Though Allah has promised a good reward for all, Allah has prepared a much richer reward for those who make Jihad for Him than for those who stay at home"
  4,96,"they have special higher ranks, forgiveness and mercy. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  4,97,"When the angels of death cause those people to die who have wronged their souls, they ask: \"What was your condition?\" They reply: \"We were oppressed in the earth.\" The angels say: \"Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to emigrate and go somewhere else?\" Hell will be their abode and it is a very evil refuge"
  4,98,"However, those helpless men, women and children who have neither the means to migrate nor strength to escape"
  4,99,"Allah may pardon them. Allah is the Pardoning, Forgiving"
  4,100,"He who emigrates in the path of Allah shall find numerous places of refuge in the Earth and abundant resources. He who leaves his home to migrate for Allah and His Messenger and dies on the way, his reward becomes due and sure with Allah. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  4,101,"When you travel in the earth, there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, especially when you fear that the unbelievers may attack you, since the unbelievers are your open enemies"
