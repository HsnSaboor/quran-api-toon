quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,150,"When Moses came back to his people, he was extremely angry and sorrowful, and he said: \"What an evil thing you have done in my place in my absence! Have you tried to hasten the retribution of your Lord?\" He put down the Holy Tablets and seized his brother by the hair of his head and dragged him closer. Haroon (Aaron) cried: \"O son of my mother! The people overpowered me and almost killed me; do not make my enemies happy over me and do not count me among the wrongdoers"
  7,151,"At this Moses said: \"O Lord! Forgive me and my brother! And admit us to Your mercy, for You are the Most Merciful of all"
  7,152,Those who worshipped the calf have indeed incurred the wrath of their Lord and disgrace in this life; thus do We recompense those who invent falsehoods
  7,153,"As for those who do evil deeds, then repent and become true believers thereafter, your Lord is most surely the Forgiving, Merciful"
  7,154,When Moses’s anger calmed down he took up the Holy Tablets in whose writing there was guidance and mercy for those that fear their Lord
  7,155,"Moses chose seventy men from his nation to accompany him to Our place of meeting. On their way when they were seized by a violent earthquake, he prayed: \"O my Lord! Had it been Your will, You could have destroyed them long ago, and myself too. Would You destroy us for the offense committed by some fools among us? That trial was ordained by You, to confound whom You willed and to guide whom You pleased. You are our Guardian, therefore, forgive us and have mercy on us; for You are the best of all forgivers"
