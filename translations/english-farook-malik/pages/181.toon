quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  8,34,"But now there is no reason why Allah should not punish them when they are blocking others from the Masjid-al-Haram (Ka'bah), whereas they are not its lawful guardians. In fact, its only guardians are those who fear Allah, even though most of them do not understand"
  8,35,"Their prayer at the House of Allah is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands: whose only answer can be, \"Taste the punishment because of your denying the truth"
  8,36,"Surely the unbelievers spend their wealth in blocking the way of Allah and so will they continue to spend; but in the end these very efforts will become the cause of their regrets; at length they will be defeated, and in the hereafter these unbelievers will be gathered together and driven to hell"
  8,37,"in order that Allah may separate the filthy from the pure. He will heap the filthy one upon another, altogether, and then cast them into hell. They are the ones who will be the losers"
  8,38,"O Prophet, tell the unbelievers that if they desist from unbelief, their past shall be forgiven; but if they persist in sin, let them reflect upon the fate of their forefathers"
  8,39,"O believers, fight them until there is no more mischief and the Deen of Allah (way of life prescribed by Allah) is established completely; but if they do stop from mischief, then surely Allah is observant of all their actions"
  8,40,"If they give no heed, then you should know that Allah is your protector. He is the best to protect and the best to help"
