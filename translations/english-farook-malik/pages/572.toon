  72,1,"O Prophet say: \"It has been revealed to me that a band of jinns listened to the Qur’an, then returned to their folk and said: ‘We have heard a wonderful Qur’an"
  72,2,which guides to the Right Way. We have believed in it and henceforth shall worship none besides Our Lord
  72,3,"Surely our Lord's Majesty is exalted: He has neither taken a wife nor a son"
  72,4,Some who are foolish among us have been uttering atrocious lies about Allah
  72,5,and we had presumed that no man or jinn could tell a lie concerning Allah
  72,6,"Indeed, some individuals among mankind used to seek protection with some individuals among the jinns, so they caused such jinns to become more arrogant"
  72,7,"as a result, they presumed as you presumed that Allah would not appoint anyone as a Messenger"
  72,8,"We searched the heaven, and found it filled with stern guards and shooting stars"

  72,10,We did not know whether an evil was intended for the dwellers of the earth or whether their Lord intended to guide them
  72,11,There are some among us who are righteous and some to the contrary; we have sects following different ways
  72,12,We know that we can neither frustrate Allah in the earth nor frustrate Him by flight
  72,13,"As for us, when we listened to the guidance, we believed in it; so he that believes in his Lord shall have neither the fear of loss nor of injustice"
