  17,50,"Tell them: \"(Yes, most certainly you shall be brought back to life), even if you be stones or iron"
  17,51,"or even something harder than this that you may think of.\" Then they will ask: \"Who will restore us?\" Say: \"The One Who created you the first time.\" Then they will shake their heads at you and ask: \"Well, when will this be?\" Say, \"It may be quite soon"
  17,52,"It will be on the Day when He will call you and you will raise up in response to it, with His praise, and you will think that you remained in the state of death but a little while"
  17,53,Tell My servants that they should speak only what is the best. Surely Satan stirs up trouble among them. The fact is that Satan is an open enemy to mankind
  17,54,"Your Lord is fully aware of your circumstances. He may be merciful to you if He wants, or He may punish you if He pleases. O Prophet, We have not sent you to be their guardian"
  17,55,Your Lord is fully aware of all that is in the heavens and in the earth. We have exalted some prophets above the others and gave Zaboor (the Psalms) to David
  17,56,"Say: \"Pray if you will to those whom you assert besides Him; they have neither the power to relieve you from any distress nor to change it"
  17,57,"Those to whom they pray, themselves seek the means of access to their Lord - trying as to who can be more near - they hope for His Mercy and fear His punishment, for the punishment of your Lord is terrible indeed"
  17,58,There is not a town but We shall destroy it before the Day of Resurrection or punish it with a severe punishment; this fact has been recorded in the Eternal Record
