quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"Ask them: \"Can any of your shoraka' (the deities you worship besides Allah) create anything and then repeat its process?\" If they do not answer, then tell them: \"Well, Allah creates and then repeats the process. Then how is that you are so misled"
  10,35,"Again ask them: \"Is there any of your shoraka' who can guide you to the truth?\" If they do not answer, then tell them: \"Well, Allah can guide you to the truth. Then who is more worthy to be followed: He that can guide to the truth, or he that cannot and is himself in need of guidance? What is the matter with you? What kind of judgement do you make"
  10,36,The fact is that most of them follow nothing but mere conjecture and conjecture is in no way a substitute for the truth. Surely Allah is well aware of all that they do

  10,38,"Do they say: \"He (the Prophet) has forged it?\" Tell them: \"If what you say be true; then produce one Surah like this, you may even call to your aid anyone you want other than Allah"
  10,39,"Nay! They do not believe that which they cannot grasp, for they have not yet seen its prophecy fulfilled. The same way those who passed before them disbelieved. But see what was the end of the wrongdoers"
  10,40,"Of these people there are some who will believe in it and some will not: and your Lord best knows the troublemakers"
  10,41,"If they do not believe you, say: \"I am responsible for my actions and you are for yours! You are not accountable for my actions, nor I am responsible for what you do"
