quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  57,12,"On the Day of Judgment you shall see the true believing men and the believing women, with their light shining before them and on their right hands, and it will be said to them: \"Rejoice today, you shall enter the gardens beneath which rivers flow, in which you shall live forever, and that is the highest achievement"
  57,13,"On that Day the hypocrite men and hypocrite women will say to the true believers: \"Wait for us, that we may borrow some of your light.\" But they will be told: \"Go away! Seek your light elsewhere.\" So a wall with a gate shall be set up between them. Inside there shall be mercy, and outside all along there shall be punishment of hell"
  57,14,"They will call out to the believers, saying: \"Were we not on your side?\" \"Yes,\" they will reply, \"but you led yourselves into temptation, you wavered, you doubted, and were deceived by your vain desires until Allah’s command came, while the arch-deceiver (Satan) deceived you concerning Allah till the last moment"
  57,15,"They will be told, \"Today no ransom shall be accepted from you, or from the unbelievers. Your abode is the fire: which you have justly earned, and it is an evil refuge"
  57,16,"Has not the time arrived for the believers to submit with fervent hearts to Allah’s warning and to the truth He has revealed, so that they may not become like those who were given the Book before this, even though their term was prolonged for them but their hearts became hardened? Today most among them are transgressors"
  57,17,"You should know that Allah restores the earth to life after its death. We have spelled out Our revelations for you, so that you may understand"
  57,18,"Surely the charitable men and the charitable women, and those who give a goodly loan to Allah, shall be repaid manyfold, and also be given a liberal reward besides it"
