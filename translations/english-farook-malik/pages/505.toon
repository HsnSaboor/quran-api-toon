quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  46,21,"Tell them the story of ‘Ad’s brethren, the Prophet Hud, when he warned his people, the residents of Ahqaf - in fact Warners came to them before him and after him saying: \"Worship none but Allah. Surely I fear for you the torment of a mighty Day"
  46,22,"They replied: \"Have you come to turn us away from our gods? Bring us the torment that you threaten us with, if you are telling the truth"
  46,23,"The Prophet Hud said: \"The Knowledge of when it is going to come is only with Allah. I am only conveying the Message with which I have been sent, however, I can see that you are ignorant people"
  46,24,"Then when they saw the torment in the shape of a cloud coming towards their valleys, they said: \"This cloud will bring us rain.\" - \"Nay! It is what you were asking for, a fierce wind bringing you a woeful torment"
  46,25,"It is going to destroy everything by the command of its Lord. Consequently by the morning, there was nothing to be seen except the ruins of their dwellings. Thus did We reward those guilty people"
  46,26,"We had established them much better than We have established you, O Qureysh of Mecca, and endowed them with the faculties of hearing, seeing, and intellect.

  46,27,We have destroyed the towns which once flourished around you - and We repeatedly sent them Our revelations so that they may turn to the Right Way
  46,28,"Then Why did not those whom they worshipped besides Allah help them who they regarded as a means of attaining nearness to Him? But those deities utterly forsook them, because those were nothing but their lies and their false inventions"
