quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"Abraham asked: \"O Divine Messengers, what is your errand"
  51,32,"They replied: \"We have been sent to a guilty nation (people of Lot, who were homosexuals)"
  51,33,to shower upon them brimstone
  51,34,marked by your Lord for the transgressors
  51,35,Then We saved all those who were believers in the town
  51,36,We found none but one household of true Muslims
  51,37,We left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment
  51,38,"There is also a sign for you in the story of Moses: when We sent him to Pharaoh with clear authority"
  51,39,"but he turned his back along with his chiefs, saying: \"He (Moses) is a sorcerer or a madman"
  51,40,"Consequently, We seized him and his warriors, and cast them into the sea. Indeed he deserved much blame"
  51,41,"There is also a sign in the story of 'Ad: when We let loose on them a blighting wind"
  51,42,which made rotten everything that it blew on
  51,43,"Likewise the story of Thamud, when it was said to them: \"Enjoy yourselves for a while"
  51,44,but they disobeyed the commandment of their Lord; consequently they were overtaken by the thunderbolt even while they were looking on
  51,45,So neither they could stand up on their feet nor could they defend themselves
  51,46,And We destroyed the people of Noah before them because they too were transgressors
  51,47,"We have built the heavens with Our hands, for We have the power to do so"
  51,48,We have spread out the earth; how excellent a spreader We are
  51,49,"We have created everything in pairs, so that you may learn a lesson from it"
  51,50,"O Prophet, say to mankind: \"Rush towards Allah, surely I am assigned by Him as a plain Warner to you all"
  51,51,"Do not set up another god besides Allah, surely I am assigned by Him as a plain Warner to you all"
