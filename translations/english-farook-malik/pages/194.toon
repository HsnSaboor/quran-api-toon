quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,41,March forth whether you are equipped lightly or heavily and make Jihad in the way of Allah with your wealth and your persons. That is best for you if you understand
  9,42,"As for the hypocrites, if the gain would have been immediate and the journey short, they would have certainly accompanied you, but the long journey (in Tabuk expedition) was too hard for them. To justify their not accompanying you, they would even swear by Allah, \"If we were able, we would certainly have marched with you.\" By doing so, they are destroying their own souls, for Allah knows that they are liars"
  9,43,Allah forgives you! But why did you (O Muhammad) give them leave to stay behind? (You yourself should have not given them leave) so that it would have become clear which of them spoke the truth and which of them invented false excuses
  9,44,Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day will never ask you for exemption from fighting with their wealth and their persons. Allah is aware of those who are righteous
  9,45,"Only those people ask for exemption who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day and whose hearts are filled with doubt, and are wavering because of their doubts"
  9,46,"If they had intended to march forth, they would certainly have made some preparation for it; but Allah did not like their going forth; so He made them lag behind and they were told \"stay behind with those who stay behind"
  9,47,"Had they gone with you they would have added nothing but mischief, and they would have made efforts to create disorder among your ranks, and there would have been some among you who would have listened to them. Allah knows the wrongdoers"
