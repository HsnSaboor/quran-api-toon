quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  34,8,"Has he forged a lie against Allah or is he mad?\" Nay! In fact those who do not believe in the Hereafter are doomed, for they are in gross error"
  34,9,"Do they not see the sky and the earth that surrounds them from front and from behind? If We want, We can cave in the earth to swallow them up or let the fragments of the sky fall upon them. Surely there is a sign in this for every devotee that turns to Allah in repentance"
  34,10,"We bestowed Our blessings on David and commanded: \"O mountains! Join him in singing My rhymes,\" and a similar command was given to the birds. We made iron soft for him"
  34,11,"saying: \"make coats of armor measuring out the links in mail and O people of David, do good deeds; surely I am watching over all of your actions"
  34,12,"And We made the winds subservient to Solomon, which made a month’s journey in the morning and a month’s journey in the evening; and We made a fountain of molten copper to flow for him; and subdued Jinns for him who worked in front of him by the leave of his Lord; and if any of them turned aside from Our command, We made Him taste the punishment of the blazing fire"
  34,13,"They worked for him as he desired: making arches, images, basins as large as reservoirs and built-in cooking cauldrons. We said: \"O Family of David! Work gratefully.\" Only a few of My devotees are truly grateful"
  34,14,"When We decreed Solomon’s death he was leaning on his staff. The Jinns did not know that he was dead until the termite ate away his staff and he fell down. Thus it became clear to the Jinns that if they had known the unseen, they would not have continued in the humiliating punishment of their task"
