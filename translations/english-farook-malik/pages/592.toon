quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,But O men! You prefer the life of this world
  87,17,while the Hereafter is better and everlasting
  87,18,Surely the same was said in the earlier scriptures
  87,19,the scriptures of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Has the news of the over shadowing event of resurrection reached you
  88,2,On that Day some faces shall be downcast
  88,3,"in hard labor, worn out"
  88,4,scorching in the blazing fire
  88,5,given to drink from a boiling fountain
  88,6,They shall have no food except bitter thorny fruit
  88,7,which will neither provide nourishment nor satisfy hunger
  88,8,While some faces on that Day shall be radiant
  88,9,well pleased with their endeavors
  88,10,in a lofty garden
  88,11,Therein they shall hear no loose talk
  88,12,Therein they shall have running springs
  88,13,Therein they shall be reclining on raised soft couches
  88,14,with goblets placed before them
  88,15,silky cushions ranged in order
  88,16,and fine carpets richly spread
  88,17,"Do they not look at the camels, how they were created"
  88,18,"The heaven, how it was raised high"
  88,19,"The mountains, how they were firmly set"
  88,20,"And the earth, how it is spread out"
  88,21,"So keep on giving admonition, for you are an admonisher"
  88,22,not a taskmaster over them
  88,23,As for those who turn their backs and disbelieve
  88,24,Allah will punish them with the mighty punishment
  88,25,Surely to Us is their return
  88,26,then surely it is for Us to take their account
