quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,89,"Allah replied: \"Your prayer shall be answered! So remain steadfast and do not follow the path of those who have no knowledge"
  10,90,"We led the Children of Israel across the sea. Pharoah and his hosts pursued them with wickedness and oppression, until when drowning, he cried out: \"I believe that there is no god but Him in Whom the Children of Israel believe and I have become one of the Muslims"
  10,91,"In response it was said to him: \"Now you believe! But a little while before you were disobedient and one of the mischief-makers"
  10,92,"We shall save your body this day, so that you may become a sign for the succeeding generations; indeed many among mankind are heedless of Our signs"
  10,93,We settled the Children of Israel in a respectable dwelling place and provided them with the good things of life. They did not cause dissension until after knowledge had come to them. Surely your Lord will judge between them in those matters in which they caused dissension on the Day of Resurrection
  10,94,"If you are in doubt regarding what We have revealed to you, ask those who have been reading the Book before you. In fact, the truth has indeed come to you from your Lord: therefore, do not be of those who doubt"

  10,96,"In fact, those against whom the Word of your Lord has proved true will not believe"
  10,97,"even if every sign should come to them, until they themselves see the painful punishment"
