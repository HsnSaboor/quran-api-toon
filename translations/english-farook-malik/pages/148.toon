quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,147,"Now if they disbelieve you, say: \"Your Lord is the owner of boundless Mercy; but His scourge cannot be averted from criminal people"
  6,148,"In response to this the pagans will promptly say: \"If Allah wanted, neither we nor our forefathers would have been pagans, or we could have made anything unlawful.\" That is how their ancestors rejected the truth in the past until they tasted of Our punishment. If they say so, then ask them: \"Do you have any evidence that you can put before us? The fact of the matter is, you believe in nothing but conjecture and follow nothing but falsehood"
  6,149,"Say: \"In contrast to your position, Allah’s argument is conclusive; if it had been His will He could indeed have guided you all"
  6,150,"Say: \"Bring your witnesses to prove that Allah did forbid so and so.\" Even if they so testify, do not testify with them, nor yield to the wishes of those who deny Our revelations, disbelieve in the hereafter, and set up others as equals with their Lord"
  6,151,"O Muhammad, say: \"Come, I will recite what your Lord has forbidden to you: not to commit shirk with Him, to be kind to your parents, not to kill your children making the excuse of inability to support them - We provide sustenance for you and for them not to commit shameful deeds whether open or secret, not to kill any soul forbidden by Allah except for the requirements of justice. These are the things which He enjoined you so that you may learn wisdom"
