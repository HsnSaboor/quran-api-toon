quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,The privilege of protection enjoyed by the Qureysh
  106,2,"safe passage of their trading caravans in the winter and the summer (due to their being the caretakers of the House of Allah, and they know this fact)"
  106,3,So they should worship the Lord of this House
  106,4,Who provided them food in the days of famine and made them secure against fear
  107,1,Have you seen the one who denies the Day of Judgment
  107,2,He it is who drives away the orphan with harshness
  107,3,and does not encourage the feeding of the poor
  107,4,So woe to those who offer Salah (prayers)
  107,5,but are neglectful of their Salah (offer Prayers but disregard the very purpose of establishing Salah - to have the fear of Allah and be mindful to the needs of other people)
  107,6,those who make a show of piety
  107,7,and refuse to share the necessities of life
  108,1,"O Muhammad, surely We have granted you the Kauthar (countless blessings, plenty)"
  108,2,"Therefore, offer Salah (prayer) to your Lord and sacrifice"
  108,3,Surely your enemy is the one who will be cut off from the root
