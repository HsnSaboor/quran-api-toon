quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By the time through the ages
  103,2,Surely mankind is in loss
  103,3,except those who believe and do good deeds; exhort one another to the truth and exhort one another to patience
  104,1,Woe to every slanderer and defamer
  104,2,who amasses wealth and keeps on counting it
  104,3,He thinks that his wealth will insure his status forever
  104,4,By no means! He shall be thrown into Hotamah
  104,5,What will make you understand what Hotamah is
  104,6,It is the fire kindled to a blaze by Allah Himself
  104,7,The one which will rise right to the hearts
  104,8,closing in upon them from every side
  104,9,in outstretched columns
  105,1,"Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the Army of the Elephant (reference is made to Abraha, a Christian king of Yaman, who attacked Mecca with the army of elephants in the year of the Prophet Muhammad’s birth)"
  105,2,Did He not make their treacherous plan a flop
  105,3,And send against them flocks of birds
  105,4,which pelted them with stones of baked clay
  105,5,thus rendered them like the chewed- up chaff
