quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  58,7,"Are you not aware that Allah knows all that is in the heavens and in the earth? It cannot be that three persons converse in secret and He is not the fourth of them; or five persons converse in secret and He is not the sixth of them; whether fewer or more, wherever they may be, He is with them. Then on the Day of Resurrection He will inform them of what they have done, surely Allah has knowledge of all things"
  58,8,"Have you not seen those who, though forbidden to hold secret counsels, persistently do what was forbidden? They hold secret counsels among themselves for sin, hostility and disobedience to the Messenger. Yet when they come to you, they greet you in words which Allah does not greet you with, and say to themselves: \"Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?\" Hell is enough for them, they shall burn in its flames, what an evil destination"
  58,9,"O believers! When you confer together in private, do not talk about sin and hostility and disobedience to the Messenger; but to counsel about virtue and piety, and fear Allah, before whom you shall be brought together"
  58,10,"Conspiring in secret is the work of Satan, who means to vex the believers; but he cannot harm them at all except as Allah permits; so in Allah let the believers put their trust"
  58,11,"O believers! When you are asked to make room in your meetings, make room, Allah will make room for you in the Hereafter. And if you are told to rise up, then rise up: Allah will raise to higher ranks those of you who have faith and knowledge. Allah is aware of all your actions"
