quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,181,"Allah hath heard the taunt of those who say: \"Truly, Allah is indigent and we are rich!\"- We shall certainly record their word and (their act) of slaying the prophets in defiance of right, and We shall say: \"Taste ye the penalty of the Scorching Fire"
  3,182,"This is because of the (unrighteous deeds) which your hands sent on before ye: For Allah never do injustice to His servants"
  3,183,"They (also) said: \"Allah took our promise not to believe in a messenger unless he showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire (from heaven).\" Say: \"There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: why then did ye slay them, if ye speak the truth"
  3,184,"Then if they reject thee, so were rejected messengers before thee, who came with Clear Signs, The Scriptures, and the Book of Enlightenment"
  3,185,"Every soul shall have the taste of death: And only on the Day of Judgment shall you be paid your full recompense. Only he who is saved far from the Fire and admitted to the Garden will have succeeded: For the life of this world is but goods and chattels of deception"
  3,186,"Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves; and ye shall certainly hear much that will grieve you, from those who received the Book before you and from those who worship partners besides Allah. But if ye persevere patiently, and guard against evil,-then that will be of great resolution"
