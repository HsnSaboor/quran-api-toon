quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  14,11,"Their Messengers said to them: \"It is true that we are human like yourselves, but Allah bestows His grace of appointing a Messenger on such of His servants as He pleases. It is not in our power to bring you any sign except by Allah’s permission, and in Allah let the believers put their trust"
  14,12,"What reason do we have not to put our trust in Allah, when He has already guided us to the ways of our lives? We shall certainly endure your persecution patiently, and those who want to put their trust, should put their trust in Allah"
  14,13,"Finally the unbelievers said to their Messengers: \"Return to our religion or we will expel you from our land.\" But their Lord revealed His will to them: \"We shall destroy the wrongdoers"
  14,14,and give you the land to dwell in after they are gone! This is the reward for the ones who dread My eminence and fear My threats
  14,15,"The Messengers called for judgement, (and when the judgement was passed) every tyrant opposer of the Truth was disappointed"
  14,16,Hell is next for him wherein he will be given festering water to drink
  14,17,"he will sip, but never will be able to swallow. Death will surround him from all sides, yet he will not die; beyond that there will be horrible punishment"
  14,18,"The parable of the deeds of those who deny their Lord is that their deeds are like ashes which the wind scatters on a stormy day; they will gain nothing from their deeds, and this is to stray far away from the goal of getting back to Paradise"
