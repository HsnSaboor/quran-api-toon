quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,60,"Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been revealed to you and other prophets before you? Yet they desire that the judgment (in their disputes) be made by Taghut (forces of Satan) though they were commanded to reject them, and Satan’s wish is to lead them far astray into deep error"
  4,61,"When it is said to them: \"Come to be judged by the Messenger in accordance with what Allah has revealed, \" you see that the hypocrites show their utmost hesitation in coming to you"
  4,62,But see how they behave when they get into trouble as a consequence of their own doings? They come to you swearing by Allah that they desired nothing but to promote good and bring about a reconciliation
  4,63,"Allah knows what really is in their hearts; therefore, neglect their attitude, admonish them, and speak to them effectual words which may go deep into their hearts"
  4,64,"We did not send any Messenger but to be obeyed by Allah’s leave. If they would have come to you when they had wronged themselves to seek Allah’s forgiveness and if the Messenger had also asked Allah’s forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Forgiving, Merciful"
  4,65,"Nay! O Muhammad - by your Lord - they will never be true believers until they accept you as a judge in their disputes, then they do not find any resentment in their hearts against your verdicts and accept them with complete submission"
