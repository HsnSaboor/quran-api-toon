quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"Those who disbelieve and obstruct Allah's Way, He will render their deeds fruitless"
  47,2,As for those who believe and do good deeds and believe in what is revealed to Muhammad - the truth from their Lord - He will remove from them their evils and improve their condition
  47,3,"This is because the unbelievers follow falsehood, while the believers follow the truth from their Lord. Thus, Allah cites their similitudes for mankind"
  47,4,"Therefore, when you meet the unbelievers in the battlefield smite their necks and, when you have thoroughly subdued them, then take prisoners of war and bind them firmly. After the war lays down her burdens, then you have the choice whether you show them favor or accept ransom. Thus are you commanded. If Allah wanted, He Himself could have punished them; but He adopted this way so that He may test some of you by means of others. As for those who are slain in the cause of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost"
  47,5,"Soon He will guide them, improve their condition"
  47,6,and admit them to the paradise which He has announced for them
  47,7,"O believers! If you help the cause of Allah, He will help you and establish your feet firmly"
  47,8,"As for the unbelievers, they shall be consigned to perdition, and He will bring their deeds to nothing"
  47,9,"That is because they hate the revelations of Allah; therefore, He rendered their deeds fruitless"
  47,10,Have they not traveled through the land and seen what was the end of those who have gone before them? Allah destroyed them utterly and a similar fate awaits these unbelievers
  47,11,This is because Allah is the Protector of the believers while the unbelievers have no protector
