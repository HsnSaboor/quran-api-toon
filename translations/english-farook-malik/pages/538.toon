quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  57,4,"It is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods, then firmly established Himself on the throne of authority.

  57,5,"To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all affairs go back to Allah for decision"

  57,7,"Believe in Allah and His Messenger and spend in charity out of what you have been made the inheritors of, for those of you who believe and spend in charity shall be richly rewarded"
  57,8,"What is the matter with you that you do not believe in Allah, whereas the Messenger is inviting you to believe in your Lord, Who has indeed taken your covenant, if you are true men of faith"
  57,9,"He it is Who sends clear revelations to His servant, so that he may lead you from the depths of darkness into the light. Surely Allah is Most Kind and Most Merciful to you"
  57,10,"What is the matter with you that you do not spend in the Way of Allah, whereas to Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth?

Yet Allah has promised you all a good reward, and Allah is aware of all your actions"
  57,11,"Who is the one that will give to Allah a goodly loan, so that He may increase it manyfold to his credit and give him a liberal reward besides it"
