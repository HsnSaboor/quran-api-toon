quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  85,1,By the heaven and its constellations
  85,2,By the promised Day of Judgment
  85,3,By the witnesses and that which is being witnessed
  85,4,Doomed be the makers of the ditch
  85,5,who lit the fuel-fed fire
  85,6,and sat around it
  85,7,to watch what they were doing to the believers
  85,8,"They tortured them for no other reason than that they believed in Allah, the All-Mighty, the Praise Worthy"
  85,9,"the One to Whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and earth, and Allah is Witness to all things"
  85,10,"Those who persecute the believing men and believing women and do not repent, shall receive the punishment of hell, wherein they shall have the punishment of conflagration"
  85,11,"As for those who believe and do good deeds, they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow; which will be the greatest success"
  85,12,"Surely, the seizure of your Lord is very severe"
  85,13,"Surely, He it is Who originates the creation of everything, and He it is Who will repeat it on the Day of Resurrection"
  85,14,"He is the Forgiving, the Loving"
  85,15,"the Owner of the Throne, the Glorious"
  85,16,and the executor of His own will
  85,17,Have you not heard the story of the warriors
  85,18,of Pharaoh and of Thamud
  85,19,Yet the unbelievers persist in denying the truth
  85,20,although Allah has encircled them from all around
  85,21,Surely this is a Glorious Qur’an
  85,22,inscribed on an Imperishable Tablet
