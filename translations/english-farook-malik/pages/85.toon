quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,38,"Similarly, Allah does not like those who spend their wealth to show off to the people, believing neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. In fact the one who chooses Satan as his companion has chosen a very evil companion"
  4,39,What harm would they have suffered if they had believed in Allah and the Last Day and spent in charity out of what Allah had given them? Allah Knows them all
  4,40,Rest assured that Allah does not wrong anyone even by an atom’s weight. If someone does a good deed He increases it many fold and also gives an extra great reward on His own
  4,41,"Just imagine how they will feel when We shall bring a witness from every nation and call upon you , O Muhammad, to testify against them"
  4,42,On that Day (the Day of Judgment) those who rejected faith and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they were levelled with earth; for they will not be able to hide a single word from Allah
  4,43,"O believers! Do not offer your Salah when you are drunk until you know what you are saying; nor after seminal emission, except when you are travelling, unless you wash your whole body. If you are sick, or on a journey, or one of you has used the toilet, or has had contact with women (sexual relation with wives) and can find no water, then make Tayammum: take some clean earth and rub your faces and hands with it. Allah is Lenient, Forgiving"
  4,44,Have you not considered the case of those to whom a portion of the Book was given? They purchased error for themselves and wish to see you lose the Right Way
