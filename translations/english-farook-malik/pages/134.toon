quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,53,"That’s how We have made some of them (poor and slaves who accepted Islam) a means for testing the others (the chiefs of Qureysh), so that they should say: \"Are these the people whom Allah favors among us (the poor, indigent and low class)?\" Well, does Allah not know best those who are grateful"
  6,54,"When those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say: \"Peace be upon you. Your Lord has decreed mercy upon Himself. If anyone among you commits evil because of ignorance and thereafter repents and mends his ways; you will find Allah Forgiving, Merciful"
  6,55,"Thus, We spell out Our revelations, so that the way of the culprits may become evident"
  6,56,"O Muhammad, tell them: \"I am forbidden to worship those whom you call upon besides Allah.\" Say: \"I am not going to follow your wishes: if I do, I would be lost and cease to be from the rightly guided"
  6,57,"Say: \"I am on a clear proof from my Lord which you have denied, but the scourge of Allah, which you are in such a rush to see, is not in my power. No one has the authority of passing Judgment except Allah: He declares the truth and He is the best of Judges"
  6,58,"Say: \"If what you rush to see was in my power, the matter between you and me would have been settled long ago; but Allah knows best how to deal with wrongdoers"
  6,59,"He Alone has the keys of the unseen treasures, of which no one knows except Him. He knows whatever is in the land and in the sea; there is not a single leaf that falls without His knowledge, there is neither a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry which has not been recorded in a Clear Book"
