quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,and that what is in their breasts will be made known
  100,11,surely their Lord on that Day shall have full knowledge about them
  101,1,The Qariah
  101,2,What is the Qariah
  101,3,And what will explain to you what the Qariah is
  101,4,It is that Day when men shall be like scattered moths
  101,5,and the mountains like colorful carded wool
  101,6,"On that Day, he whose scale of good deeds is heavy"
  101,7,shall live a pleasant luxurious life
  101,8,But he whose scale of good deeds is light
  101,9,shall abode in Haviah
  101,10,"and what will explain to you, what it (Haviah) is"
  101,11,It is a blazing fire
  102,1,"O mankind, you have been distracted by the rivalry of piling up worldly gains against one another"
  102,2,You will never be satisfied until you get into the grave
  102,3,"Nevertheless, soon you shall come to know"
  102,4,"Again, nevertheless, soon you shall come to know"
  102,5,Nay! Would that you knew through the real knowledge provided to you in this Qur’an and care about your life in the Hereafter
  102,6,Because on the Day of Judgment when you shall see the hell
  102,7,and see it with the certainty of your own eyes
  102,8,"you shall believe it, but that belief is going to do you no good because - on that Day, you shall be questioned about the blessings (faculties and resources that you were given in the worldly life - as to how you used them)"
