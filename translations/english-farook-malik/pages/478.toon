  41,14,"When their Messengers came to them from before and from behind, saying: \"Worship none but Allah.\" They replied: \"If our Lord wanted to send us a message, He would certainly have sent down angels, so we categorically deny the message with which you are sent"
  41,15,"As for ‘Ad, they WORSHIP/DECIPHERMENT conducted themselves with arrogance in the land without any justification and said: \"Who is stronger than us in might?\" Could they not see that Allah Who created them, was mightier than them? Yet they continued to reject Our revelations"
  41,16,"So, over a few ill-omened days, We let loose on them a furious hurricane to make them taste a shameful scourge in this life, but more shameful still will be the punishment of the hereafter, and they shall have none to help them"
  41,17,"As for Thamud, We offer them Our guidance, but they preferred to remain blind rather than to receive guidance towards the Right Way; so the thunderbolt of humiliating scourge seized them for their misdeeds"
