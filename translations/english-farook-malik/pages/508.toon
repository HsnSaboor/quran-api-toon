quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  47,12,"Surely Allah will admit those who believe and do good deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow. While those who are unbelievers, they are to enjoy only this life and eat as cattle eat; but in the hereafter, the fire shall be their abode"
  47,13,"How many cities which were mightier than your city which has driven you out, have We destroyed for their disbelief, and there was none to save them"
  47,14,Can he who follows the clear guidance from his Lord be compared to him who is led by his own desires and whose foul deeds seem fair to him
  47,15,"Here is the parable of the paradise which the righteous have been promised: it has rivers the water of which will never be stagnant, rivers of milk whose taste never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of honey pure and clear. In it they will have all kinds of fruits, as well as forgiveness from their Lord. Can such people be compared to those who shall dwell in hell forever, and they will be given scalding water which will cut their intestines into pieces"
  47,16,"Some of them indeed listen to you but no sooner do they leave your presence than they ask those endowed with knowledge: \"What was it that he said just now?\" Such are the men upon whose hearts Allah has set a seal, and who follow their own desires"
  47,17,"As for those who follow the Right Way, Allah will increase their guidance and bestow on them their righteousness"
  47,18,"Are they waiting for the Hour of Doom to overtake them all of a sudden? Do they not know that its signs have already come and when it will actually overtake them, what chance will they have to benefit by this admonition"
  47,19,"Therefore, you should know that there is no god but Allah; implore Him to forgive your sins and to forgive the believing men and believing women; for Allah knows your activities and your resting places"
