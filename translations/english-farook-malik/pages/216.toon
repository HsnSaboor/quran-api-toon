quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,62,Be aware! The friend of Allah has nothing to fear or to regret
  10,63,Those who believe and (constantly) guard against evil
  10,64,for them there is good news in this life and in the hereafter - Allah’s Words do not change - this is indeed the mighty achievement
  10,65,"O Prophet, let not their remarks grieve you: surely all honor belongs to Allah: He hears all and knows all"
  10,66,Be aware! Indeed whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth belongs to Allah. Those who invoke other deities besides Allah follow nothing but conjectures and preach nothing but falsehood
  10,67,"He is the One Who has made the night for you to rest therein and the day so that you can see. Indeed, there are signs in this for those who listen to His message"
  10,68,"They (Jews and Christians) say: \"Allah has begotten a son!\" Glory be to Him! He is self-sufficient! His is all that is in the Heavens and in the Earth! Have you any proof for what you say? Would you ascribe to Allah something about which you have no knowledge"
  10,69,"O Prophet, tell them: \"Those who ascribe false things to Allah will never prosper"
  10,70,"Well, they may have a little enjoyment in this world, but eventually they have to return to Us and then We will make them taste the severest punishment for their unbelief"
