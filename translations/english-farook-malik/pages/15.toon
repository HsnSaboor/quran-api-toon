quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,94,"Say O Muhammad: \"If the Home of the Hereafter is exclusively for you and not for the rest of mankind, then wish for death if you are true in your claim"
  2,95,"But they will never wish for death, because they are fully aware of the consequences of what they have sent before them for the Hereafter. And Allah knows the mentality of the wrongdoers"
  2,96,"You will find them the greediest of men for life, even greedier than the pagans; each one of them wishes to be given a life of a thousand years; but the grant of such a life will not save them from the punishment, for Allah is watching whatever they do"
  2,97,"Say O Muhammad: \"Whoever is the enemy of Jibra'el (Gabriel) should know that he revealed this Qur'an to your heart by Allah’s command, which confirms previous scriptures, and is a guidance and good news for the believers"
  2,98,"Let them know that whoever is an enemy to Allah, His angels, His Messengers, Jibra'el (Gabriel) and Mika‘el (Michael); Allah is an enemy to such unbelievers"
  2,99,"We have sent down to you clear revelations: no one can deny them except the transgressors"
  2,100,Has it not been the case that every time they made a covenant a group of them threw it aside? But the fact is that most of them are faithless
  2,101,"Whenever there came to them a Messenger from Allah confirming their own Holy Book, a group from those to whom the Holy book were given cast off the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they knew nothing about it"
