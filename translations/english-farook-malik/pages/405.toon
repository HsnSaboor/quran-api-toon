quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,6,This is the promise of Allah and Allah never breaks His promise; but most people do not know
  30,7,"They only know the outward show of this world’s life, but they are heedless about the life to come"
  30,8,Have they not considered in their own minds that Allah created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them for a just reason and for a specified time? But the truth is that many among mankind do not believe in the meeting with their Lord (the Day of Resurrection)
  30,9,"Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them? They were superior in strength than these; they tilled the soil and built on it more than these have ever built. There came to them their Messengers with clear signs (but they rejected them to the detriment of their own destruction): it was not Allah Who wronged them, but they wronged their own souls"
  30,10,"Evil was the outcome for those who committed evil, rejected the revelations of Allah and kept ridiculing them"
  30,11,"It is Allah Who originates creation; then repeats it, and then to Him you shall be brought back"
  30,12,"On the Day when the Hour of Judgement will be established, the criminals shall be in despair"
  30,13,"None of their shoraka' (gods which they had set up besides Allah), will be there to intercede for them and they themselves will disown their shoraka"
  30,14,"On that Day when the Hour of Judgement will be established, mankind will be sorted out"
  30,15,Those who have embraced the faith and have done good deeds shall be made happy in a garden of paradise
