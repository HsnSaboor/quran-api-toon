quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,60,"who give to charity whatever they can give, and their hearts are full of fear by the very idea that they shall have to return to their Lord"
  23,61,it is they who rush in doing good deeds and try to be the first in attaining them
  23,62,"We charge no soul with more than it can bear; We have a Book of record which shall clearly tell the truth, and they shall not be treated unjustly"
  23,63,But their hearts are blind to all this; and their deeds are also different from the believers. They will continue doing their misdeeds
  23,64,until when We seize those of them who live in comfort with punishment; lo! Then they start crying for help in supplication
  23,65,"We shall say: \"Do not cry for help this Day, for surely from Us you shall receive no help"
  23,66,"My revelations were recited to you, but you used to turn back on your heels"
  23,67,"in arrogance, talking nonsense about The Qur’an like one telling fables by night"
  23,68,Do they not ponder over the Word of Allah or has anything new come to them which did not come to their forefathers
  23,69,"Or is it because they do not recognize their Messenger, who is a member of their own community, that they deny him"
  23,70,Or are they really convinced that he is a madman? Nay! In fact he has brought them the Truth and most of them dislike the Truth
  23,71,"Had the Truth followed their appetites, the heavens, the earth and everything therein would have been disrupted. Nay! We have given them their reminder, but they are heedless to their reminder"
  23,72,"Or is it that you are asking them for some recompense? But the recompense of your Lord is the best, for He is the best provider of sustenance"
  23,73,"As a matter of fact, you (O Muhammad) are calling them to the Straight Way"
  23,74,and surely those who do not believe in the hereafter will ever stray from the Straight Way
