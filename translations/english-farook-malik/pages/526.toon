quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star when it sets
  53,2,"your companion (Muhammad) is neither astray, nor misguided"
  53,3,nor does he speak out of his own desire
  53,4,This Qur’an is but an inspired revelation
  53,5,He is being taught by one who is mighty powerful (angel Gabriel)
  53,6,the one free from defects who became stable in the view
  53,7,He stood poised at the uppermost horizon
  53,8,"then he drew near, coming closer"
  53,9,within the length of two bows or even closer
  53,10,and revealed to Allah's servant (Muhammad) that what he was supposed to reveal
  53,11,His (Muhammad’s) own heart did not deny that which he saw
  53,12,"How can you, O unbelievers then, question what he saw"
  53,13,And he (Muhammad) saw him once again
  53,14,"near Sidra-tul-Muntaha (the Lote-tree at the farthest end of the seven heavens, beyond which none can pass)"
  53,15,Near it is Janna-tul-M’awa (the rest-house of paradise)
  53,16,When that Lote-tree was covered with what covered it
  53,17,his eyes did not turn aside nor did they exceed the limit
  53,18,and he did indeed see some of his Lord’s greatest signs
  53,19,Have you ever seen LAt and Uzza
  53,20,"and another, the third Manat (names of Arabian idols, claimed by the pagans of Mecca to be the daughters of Allah)"
  53,21,"Are you to have sons, and He the daughters"
  53,22,This indeed is an unfair division
  53,23,"These (LAt, Uzza and ManAt) are nothing but names which you and your forefathers have invented, for Allah has vested no authority in them. The unbelievers follow nothing but mere conjecture and the whims of their own souls, even though right guidance has already come to them from their Lord"
  53,24,Or should man have whatever he wishes
  53,25,Nay! To Allah belongs the hereafter and this present life
  53,26,How many are the angels in the heavens; yet their intercession can avail none unless Allah gives them permission in favor of whom He wants and is pleased with
