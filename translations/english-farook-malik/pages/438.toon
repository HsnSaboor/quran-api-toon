quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  35,31,"O Prophet, what We have revealed to you of the Book is the Truth, which confirms the previous scriptures. Surely, with respect to His servants, Allah is well Aware and fully Observant"
  35,32,"We have given the Book as an inheritance to those of Our servants (Muslims) whom We have chosen, among them there are some who wrong their own souls, some follow a middle course and some, by Allah’s leave, excel in good deeds; which is the supreme virtue"
  35,33,"They shall enter the gardens of Eden, where they shall be decked with bracelets of gold and pearls; and their dress therein will be of silk"
  35,34,"They will say: \"Praise be to Allah Who has removed all sorrow from us; Our Lord is indeed Forgiving and appreciative of His devotees"
  35,35,"Who has admitted us to this Eternal Home out of His bounty, wherein we neither experience any toil nor sense of any weariness"
  35,36,"As for the disbelievers, there shall be the fire of hell, no term shall be determined for them so that they could die nor shall its punishment be ever lightened for them. Thus shall We reward every disbeliever"
  35,37,"Therein they shall cry for help: \"Our Lord! Get us out, from now on we shall do good deeds and shall not repeat the ones we used to do\". The response will be: \"Did we not give you lives long enough so that he who would, could take a warning? Besides, someone did come to warn you. Now taste the fruit of your deeds, here there is no helper for the wrongdoers"
  35,38,"Surely Allah knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth, He even knows the secrets of the breasts (hidden thoughts of people)"
