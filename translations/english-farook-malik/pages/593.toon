quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the morning
  89,2,and the ten nights (first ten days of Dhul-Hijja)
  89,3,the even and the odd
  89,4,and the night when it departs
  89,5,Is there not in these an oath (enough evidence) for those who use their common sense
  89,6,Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with ‘Ad
  89,7,"The residents of Iram, the city of lofty pillars"
  89,8,the like of which had never been built in other cities
  89,9,And with the people of Thamud who hewed out their dwellings in the rocks of the valley
  89,10,And with Pharaoh the owner of stakes
  89,11,They all transgressed beyond bounds in their cities
  89,12,and committed great mischief therein
  89,13,"Therefore, your Lord let loose on them His scourge of torment"
  89,14,Surely your Lord is ever watchful
  89,15,"As for man, when his Lord tries him through giving him honor and blessings, he says: \"My Lord is bountiful to me"
  89,16,"But when He tries him through restricting his subsistence, he says: \"My Lord has humiliated me"
  89,17,Nay! But you did not show kindness to the orphan
  89,18,nor did you encourage each other in feeding the poor
  89,19,Greedily you lay your hands on the inheritance of the weak
  89,20,and you love wealth with all your hearts
  89,21,"Nay! You should know, when the earth will be pounded to powder"
  89,22,"your Lord will come, with angels standing in ranks"
  89,23,"hell shall be brought in sight. On that Day man will remember his deeds, but how is that remembrance going to profit him"
