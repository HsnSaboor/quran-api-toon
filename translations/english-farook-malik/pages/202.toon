quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  9,94,"They will apologize to you with all sorts of excuses when you return to them. Say: \"Present no excuses: we shall not believe you: Allah has already revealed to us the whole truth about you. Now Allah and His Messenger will keep a watch over your conduct: in the end you will return to Him Who knows what is hidden and what is open, and He will tell you all that you have been doing"
  9,95,"They will swear to you by Allah when you return to them so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone: they are filth. Hell shall be their abode, a punishment for their misdeeds"
  9,96,"They will swear to you in order to please you, but even if you be pleased with them (accept their excuses), Allah will never be pleased with these transgressors"
  9,97,"The Arabs of the desert are the worst in disbelief and hypocrisy, and are least inclined to acknowledge the limits that Allah has revealed to his Messenger. Allah is All- Knowledgeable, All-Wise"
  9,98,Some of the desert Arabs look upon whatever they spend in the way of Allah as a penalty and wait for some misfortune to befall you. May misfortune befall them! Allah hears all and knows all
  9,99,"But some of the desert Arabs believe in Allah and the Last Day, and look on what they spend in the way of Allah as a means of bringing them close to Allah and to the prayers of the Messenger. Indeed, closer they shall be brought: soon Allah will admit them to His mercy. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
