quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,60,"He is the One Who takes your souls at night (makes you go to sleep) and knows what you do during the day, then next day raises you up again to complete your allotted span of life. To Him you shall all return, then He will notify you of all that you have done"
  6,61,"He is the Irresistible (reigns supreme) over his servants and sends guardian angels over you. At length, when death approaches anyone of you, Our angels take his soul and they are not negligent in performing their duty"
  6,62,"Then those souls are brought back to Allah, their real Master. Beware! He is the Judge and He is the swiftest in settling accounts"
  6,63,"Ask them: \"Who delivers you from calamities in the darkness of the land and of the sea, when you call upon Him in open humility and silent terror: If You deliver us from this affliction, we shall become truly grateful"
  6,64,"Say: \"Allah delivers you from these and all other calamities, yet you commit shirk (worship false gods)"
  6,65,"Say: \"He has the power to send calamities on you from above and from below or to split you into discordant factions to make you taste the violence of one another. See how We present Our revelations over and over again so that they may understand the reality"
  6,66,"But your people are rejecting this (The Qur'an), although it is the very truth.\" Tell them: \"I am not appointed as your caretaker"
  6,67,"For every prophecy there is an appointed time, and soon you will come to know"
  6,68,"When you see those who are engaged in arguments about Our revelations, turn away from them until they change their topic of discussion. If Satan ever makes you forget this commandment, then as soon as you realize, withdraw from the company of wrongdoers"
