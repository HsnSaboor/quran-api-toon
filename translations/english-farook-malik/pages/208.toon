quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,1,Alif L'am Ra. These are the verses of the Book of Wisdom
  10,2,"Does it seem strange to the people that We revealed Our will to a man from among themselves, saying: \"Warn mankind and give the good news to the Believers that they are on sound footing with their Lord?\" The disbelievers say: \"This man is indeed an obvious magician"
  10,3,"The fact is that your Lord is the same Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and is firmly established on the Throne of authority, and is directing the affairs of the universe. None can intercede for you, except the one who receives His permission. This is Allah your Lord, so worship Him: will you not receive admonition"
  10,4,"To Him you shall all return. Allah’s promise is true. He is the One Who originates the process of Creation and repeats it (will bring it back to life) so that He may justly reward those who believed in Him and did righteous deeds. As for those who disbelieved, they shall have boiling fluids to drink and shall undergo a painful punishment because they rejected the truth"
  10,5,"He is the One Who gave the sun its brightness and the moon its light, established her phases that you may learn to compute the years and other such counts (days, weeks, months). Allah created them only to manifest the truth. He has spelled out His revelations for people who want to understand"
  10,6,"Indeed in the alternation of the night and the day and what Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are signs for those who are Godfearing"
