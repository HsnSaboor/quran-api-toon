quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,in which none shall burn except the wretched
  92,16,who deny the truth and give no heed
  92,17,But the pious shall be kept away from it
  92,18,the one who spends in charity for self-purification
  92,19,not seeking any favor from anyone for which a reward is expected in return
  92,20,"except seeking the good pleasure of his Lord, the Most High"
  92,21,Such persons shall soon be well-pleased with Allah
  93,1,By the morning day light
  93,2,and by the night when it covers with darkness
  93,3,"your Lord has neither forsaken you, O Muhammad, nor is He displeased"
  93,4,Certainly the later period shall be better for you than the earlier
  93,5,Soon your Lord shall grant you something with which you will be well-pleased
  93,6,Did He not find you an orphan and give you shelter
  93,7,Did He not find you lost and gave you guidance
  93,8,Did He not find you poor and made you self-sufficient
  93,9,"Therefore, do not treat the orphan with harshness"
  93,10,and do not chide away the beggar
  93,11,and rehearse the bounty of your Lord
  94,1,O Prophet! Have We not expanded your breast for you
  94,2,and relieved you from the burden
  94,3,which weighed down your back
  94,4,and exalted your fame
  94,5,Surely with every difficulty there is relief
  94,6,Surely with every difficulty there is relief
  94,7,"Therefore, when you are free from your daily task, devote your time to the labor of worship"
  94,8,and turn all your attention towards your Lord
