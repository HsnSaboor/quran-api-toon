quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,184,Fear Him Who has created you and the generations before you
  26,185,"They replied: \"You are surely one of those who are bewitched"
  26,186,You are no more than a human being like us and we think that you are lying
  26,187,Let a fragment fall out of the sky on us if you are telling the Truth
  26,188,"Shu’aib said: \"My Lord has full knowledge of all your actions"
  26,189,"So they disbelieved him, and the torment of the day of darkness (dark clouds carrying Allah's scourge) seized them, and indeed it was the torment of an extremely dreadful day"
  26,190,"Surely in this story there is a great lesson, but most of these people do not learn a lesson and become believers"
  26,191,The fact is that your Lord is the Mighty as well as the Merciful
  26,192,Surely this Qur’an is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds
  26,193,The trustworthy Spirit (Angel Gabriel) brought it down
  26,194,upon your heart so that you may become one of those who are appointed by Allah to warn the people
  26,195,in a plain Arabic language
  26,196,This fact was foretold in the scriptures of the former people
  26,197,Is it not sufficient proof for the people that the learned men of the children of Israel knew about it
  26,198,Even so that if We had revealed it to a non-Arab
  26,199,"and he had recited it to them in fluent Arabic, they would still not have believed in it"
  26,200,We have thus caused unbelief in the hearts of the guilty
  26,201,They are not going to believe in it until they see the painful scourge
  26,202,"which, in their heedlessness, will come to them suddenly"
  26,203,"Then they will ask: \"Can we be given some respite"
  26,204,Do they wish to hurry on Our scourge
  26,205,Just think! If We let them enjoy this life for many years
  26,206,and then the scourge with which they are threatened falls upon them
