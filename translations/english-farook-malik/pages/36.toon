quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,225,"Allah will not hold you accountable for what is inadvertent in your oaths, but He will hold you accountable for what you intended in your hearts; Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing"
  2,226,"Those who renounce conjugal relationship with their wives on oath have a limitation of four months. If they reconcile and restore their relationship, surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  2,227,"But if they decide to divorce them, they may do so, surely Allah hears and knows everything"
  2,228,"Divorced women must keep themselves waiting for three menstrual periods, it is not lawful for them to hide what Allah has created in their wombs, if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. In such cases their husbands have a right to take them back in that period if they desire reconciliation. Women have rights similar to those exercised against them in an equitable manner, although men have a status (degree of responsibility) above them. Allah is Mighty, Wise"
  2,229,"The pronouncement of revocable divorce is only allowed twice: then she should be allowed to stay with honor or let go with kindness after the third pronouncement. It is not lawful for husbands to take anything back which they have given them except when both parties fear that they may not be able to follow the limits set by Allah; then if you fear that they both will not be able to keep the limits of Allah, there is no blame if, by mutual agreement the wife compensates the husband to obtain divorce. These are the limits set by Allah; do not transgress them, and those who transgress the limits of Allah are the wrongdoers"
  2,230,"So if a husband divorces his wife three times, it is not lawful for him to remarry her until after she has married another man and gotten the divorced. In that case there is no blame on either of them if they reunite in marriage, provided they think that they can keep the limits of Allah. Such are the limits of Allah which He makes clear to the people of understanding"
