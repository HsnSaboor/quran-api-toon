  34,33,"Those despised weaklings will say to the arrogant: \"No! It was you who plotted day and night, bidding us to disbelieve in Allah and to set up equals with Him,\" - They will feel ashamed once they see the punishment, and We shall put yokes on the necks of those disbelievers; can there be any other reward except for what they did"
  34,34,"Whenever We have sent a Warner to a town, its wealthy residents have said: \"We surely disbelieve in what you are sent with"

  34,36,"O Prophet tell them: \"Surely my Lord gives abundantly to whom He wills and sparingly to whom He pleases, but most people do not understand this"

  34,39,"O Prophet tell them: \"Surely my Lord gives abundantly to whom He pleases and sparingly to whom He wills. Whatever you spend in charity, He will pay you back. He is the best of those who provide sustenance"
