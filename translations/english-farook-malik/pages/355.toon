quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  24,37,"by such people whom neither business nor business profit can divert from the remembrance of Allah, nor from establishing Salah and nor from paying Zakah, for they fear the Day of Judgement when hearts will be overturned and eyes will be petrified"
  24,38,"who hope that Allah will reward them according to the best of their deeds and add for them even more out of His grace: for Allah gives without measure to whom He pleases"
  24,39,"As for the unbelievers, their deeds will disappear like a mirage in a sandy desert, which the thirsty traveller thinks to be water, but when he comes near, he finds it to be nothing, instead he finds Allah to settle his account - Allah is swift in settling accounts"
  24,40,"Or another parable of unbelievers' efforts is that of a person trying to swim in a bottomless ocean overwhelmed with billows, one over the other, overcast with dark clouds - layers of utter darkness one above another - so much so that if he stretches out his hand, he can hardly see it. The one to whom Allah does not give light, will have no light"
  24,41,"Do you not see that Allah is the One Who is praised by all those who are in the heavens and in the earth? The very birds praise Him as they wing their flight. Each one knows its prayers and how to praise Him, and Allah has full knowledge of all their actions"
  24,42,To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and towards Allah lies the final goal
  24,43,"Do you not see that Allah makes the clouds move gently, then joins them together, then piles them up in masses, then you see the rain coming from inside them? He also sends down hail from the clouds that look like mountains in the sky, afflicting therewith whom He wills and turning it away from whom He pleases; the flash of His lightning almost takes away sight"
