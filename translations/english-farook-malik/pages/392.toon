quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  28,51,We have conveyed Our Word to them over and over again in order that they may take heed
  28,52,"Those to whom the scriptures were given before this (Jews and Christians), they do recognize the Truth and believe in this (Qur’an)"
  28,53,"When it is recited to them they say: \"We believe in it, surely this is the Truth from our Lord: indeed we were Muslims even before this"
  28,54,"They are the ones who will be given their reward twice, because they have endured with fortitude, repelling evil with good and giving in charity out of what We have given them"
  28,55,"When they hear vain talk, they withdraw from it saying: \"Our deeds are for us and yours for you; peace be on to you: we do not desire the way of the ignorant"
  28,56,"O Prophet, you cannot give guidance to whom you wish, it is Allah Who gives guidance to whom He pleases, and He is quite aware of those who are guided"
  28,57,"Those who do not wish to be guided say: \"If we go along with you and accept this guidance, we shall be driven out from our land.\" But have We not given them a secure sanctuary to which are brought the fruits of all kinds as a provision from Us? But most of them have no knowledge"
  28,58,"How many towns have We destroyed who once flourished in their economy? Just see those dwellings of theirs, only a few of which have been inhabited after them; at last We Alone became their inheritors"
  28,59,"Your Lord would never destroy the towns until He had sent in their metropolis a Messenger, proclaiming to them Our revelations; and We would not destroy towns except when their dwellers had become wrongdoers"
