quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  58,1,"Allah has indeed heard the words of the woman (Khawlah daughter of Tha‘labah, who had been divorced by calling her: ‘‘You are to me like my mother\" which was an acceptable practice for divorce among pagan Arabs), who pleaded with you against her husband and made her complaint to Allah, and Allah has heard what you said to each other. Allah hears all and sees all"
  58,2,"Those of you who divorce their wives by ZihAr (calling them to be like their mothers) should know that they are not their mothers. Their mothers are only those who gave birth to them. Surely the words they utter are absurd and false. Allah could punish them for this but He forgave them, surely Allah is All-Pardoning, All-Forgiving"
  58,3,"Those who divorce their wives by ZihAr, then wish to retract the words they uttered, shall have to free a slave before they touch each other. This is enjoined as a penalty for doing so. Allah is well-aware of all your actions"
  58,4,"He that has no slave, shall fast two consecutive months before they touch each other. He that cannot fast, shall feed sixty poor people. This is enjoined so that you may have faith in Allah and His Messenger. These are the limits set by Allah, and the violators shall have a painful punishment"
  58,5,"Those who resist Allah and His Messenger, shall be humiliated as were those before them. We have sent down clear revelations; the disbelievers shall have a humiliating punishment"
  58,6,"On the Day of Judgment Allah will raise them all back to life, then inform them about what they have done. Allah has kept full record of their deeds even though they may have forgotten, for Allah is a witness over all things"
