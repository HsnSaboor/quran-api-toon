quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,6,"O believers! When you rise up for Salah (prayer), wash your faces and your hands as far as the elbows, wipe your heads with wet hands and wash your feet to the ankles. If you had an emission of semen, then take a full bath. However, if you are sick or on a journey or you have used the toilet or you had intercourse with your women (your wives) and you do not find any water then resort to Tayammum - find clean soil and rub your faces and hands with it. Allah does not wish to burden you; He only wishes to purify you and to perfect His favor upon you, so that you may be thankful"
  5,7,"Remember Allah’s favor to you and the covenant which He ratified with you when you said: \"We hear and we obey.\" Have fear of Allah; surely Allah knows the secrets of your hearts"
  5,8,"O believers! Be steadfast for the sake of Allah and bear true witness and let not the enmity of a people incite you to do injustice; do justice; that is nearer to piety. Fear Allah, surely Allah is fully aware of all your actions"
  5,9,Allah has promised those who believe and do good deeds that for them there is forgiveness and mighty reward
