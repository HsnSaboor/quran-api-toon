quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,75,"If We show them mercy and relieve them of their affliction, they would obstinately persist in their rebellion, blindly wandering to and fro"
  23,76,"for even now, when We have inflicted punishment on them, they have neither submitted to their Lord nor humbled themselves towards Him"
  23,77,"Until when We open upon them a gate of severe punishment, you will see that they are plunged in utter despair"
  23,78,"It is Allah Who has given you ears, eyes and hearts - yet seldom you show gratitude"
  23,79,it is He Who has placed you in the earth and before Him you shall all be assembled on the Day of Judgement
  23,80,"It is He Who gives life and cause you to die, and in His control is the alternation of the night and the day: then why don’t you understand"
  23,81,On the contrary they just say what their forefathers said before them
  23,82,"who said: \"What! After death when our bodies become dust and bones, could we really be raised to life again"
  23,83,We have heard many such threats and so did our forefathers before us. These are nothing but legends of primitive people
  23,84,"Say: \"To whom belongs the earth and everything therein? Tell me if you know"
  23,85,"They will promptly reply: \"to Allah!\" Ask them: \"Then why you do not use your common sense and believe in Him"
  23,86,"Say: \"Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Glorious Throne"
  23,87,"Right away they will say: \"Allah.\" Ask them: \"Then why you do not fear Him"
  23,88,"Say: \"In whose hands is the sovereignty of all things, protecting all, while against Him there is no protection? Tell me if you know"
  23,89,"Quickly they will reply: \"Allah.\" Ask them: \"Then how can you be so bewitched"
