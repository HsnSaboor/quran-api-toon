quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,"O my people! I do not ask you any wealth for this work, for none but Allah can reward me. I am not going to drive away those who believe; for they will surely meet their Lord. But I can see that you are acting out of ignorance"
  11,30,"And O my people! Who will save me from Allah, if I drive them away? Don’t you understand this simple thing"
  11,31,"I do not say that I possess the Treasures of Allah, nor do I say that I have knowledge of the unseen, nor do I claim to be an angel; nor do I say of those who are mean in your eyes, that Allah will not grant them any good - Allah knows best what is in their hearts -for if I utter any thing like this, then I will indeed become a wrongdoer"
  11,32,"They said: \"O Noah! You have argued with us and argued too much, now bring upon us the scourge with which you threaten us, if what you say is true"

  11,34,"My counsel will not profit you, much as I desire to give you good counsel, if Allah wants to leave you astray; He is your Lord, and to Him you shall return"
  11,35,"Do the unbelievers say \"He (Muhammad) himself has forged all this?\" Say to them: \"If I have indeed forged it, then its sin is on me! And I am clear of the sins which you are committing for not believing it"
  11,36,"And it was revealed to Noah: \"None of your people will believe now, other than those who have already believed. So do not grieve at their evil deeds"
