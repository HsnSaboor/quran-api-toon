quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,38,"Allah will say: \"Enter the fire and join the nations of Jinns and men who have gone before you.\" As each nation will enter hell, it will curse its preceding sister till all are gathered there, the last of them will say about the first one: \"Our Lord! These have led us astray; therefore, give them double punishment of the fire.\" He will answer: \"There will be double for all, although you may not know because of being predecessor or successor in sin and aggression"
  7,39,"Then the first will say to the last: \"If we were to blame, you too, were no better than us; now taste the punishment of your misdeeds"
  7,40,"Surely, the gates of the Heaven will not be opened for those who deny Our revelations and treat them with arrogance; their admission into paradise will be as impossible as the passing of a camel through the eye of a needle. That is how We shall reward the criminals"
  7,41,Hell shall be their bed and flames shall be their covering. That is how We shall reward the wrongdoers
  7,42,"As for those who believe and do good deeds - We never burden a soul with more than it can bear - they are worthy of Paradise, wherein they will live forever"
  7,43,"We shall remove whatever ill-feeling they may have in their hearts against one another. Rivers will be flowing beneath them; and they will say: \"Praise be to Allah Who guided us this way, we would have never found the Right Way if Allah had not guided us. The Messengers of our Lord have surely preached us the truth.\" At that time they will hear the announcement: \"This is paradise, which you have inherited because of your good deeds"
