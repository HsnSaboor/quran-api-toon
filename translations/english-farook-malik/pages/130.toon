quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Ask them: \" Whose testimony is the most reliable? \" When they say Allah, then tell them: \"Let Allah be Witness between me and you (that I am the Messenger of Allah) and this Qur’an has been revealed to me by Him so that I may warn you thereby and all those whom it may reach. Can you really testify that there are other gods besides Allah?\" Tell them: \"As far as I am concerned I will never testify to this!\" Say: \"Indeed He is the One and the Only God and I am absolutely disgusted with the shirk you commit"
  6,20,"Those to whom We have given the Book know this fact as they know their own sons. In fact those who have lost their souls, will not believe"
  6,21,Who can be more wicked than a person who forges a lie against Allah or denies His revelations? Surely the wrongdoers shall never get salvation
  6,22,"On the Day of Judgment when We shall gather them all together, We shall ask the pagans: \"Where are those deities whom you ascribed to be My partners"
  6,23,"They will have no argument but to say: \"By Allah, our Lord, we were not at all pagan"
  6,24,"See how they will lie against their own souls, and how the deities of their own inventions will leave them in the lurch"
  6,25,"Of them there are some who pretend that they listen to you; but their prejudices have dulled their faculties and We have cast veils over their hearts and deafness in their ears so they are unable to understand. Even if they see every one of Our Signs, they will not believe. So much so, that when they come to you, they argue with you. The unbelievers say: \"These are nothing but tales of the old times"
  6,26,They themselves have turned away from the truth and also forbid other people to believe in it. With such a behavior they harm none but their own souls but they do not perceive it
  6,27,"If you could witness the scene, when they will be made to stand before the hellfire, they will say: \"We wish we could return to earthly life again; then we would not deny the revelations of our Lord, and we would join the believers"
