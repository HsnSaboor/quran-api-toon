quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,11,"Those who concocted the slander are from a clique among you. Do not regard this incident as only an evil, for it also contains a good lesson for you. Whoever took any part in this sin, has earned his share accordingly, and the one who took on himself the leading part, shall have a terrible punishment"
  24,12,"Why did not the believing men and believing women, when they heard of this slander, think well of their own people, and say: \"This is clearly a false accusation"
  24,13,"Why did they not produce four witnesses? If they cannot produce the required witnesses, they are the liars in the sight of Allah"
  24,14,"Were it not for the grace and mercy of Allah towards you in this world and the Hereafter, you would have been severely punished for your involvement in this scandal"
  24,15,when you passed on with your tongues and uttered with your mouths that about which you had no knowledge. You took it lightly while it was a very serious offence in the sight of Allah
  24,16,"Why did you not, when you heard about it, say: \"It is not befitting for us to talk about it, God forbid! This is a monstrous slander"
  24,17,"Allah admonishes you never to repeat a mistake like this, if you are true believers"
  24,18,"Allah has made His revelations clear to you, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  24,19,Those who love to broadcast such slanders among the believers will have a painful punishment in this life and in the Hereafter. Allah knows and you do not know
  24,20,"Were it not for the grace and mercy of Allah towards you, this scandal would have produced very bad results for you. Allah is indeed very Kind, most Merciful"
