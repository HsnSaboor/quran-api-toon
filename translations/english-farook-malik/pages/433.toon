quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,40,"One Day He will gather them all together and ask the angels: \"Was it you that these people used to worship"
  34,41,"They will respond: \"Glory be to You! Our tie is with You - as a protector - not with them; but they used to worship the Jinns and it was them in whom most of these people believed"
  34,42,"On that Day you will be helpless to profit or harm one another. To the wrongdoers We shall say: \"Taste the punishment of the fire which you persistently denied"
  34,43,"Today when Our clear revelations are recited to them, they say: \"This man only wants to turn you away from those gods to whom your forefathers have been worshipping.\" Others say: \"This Qur’an is nothing but an invented falsehood.\" While yet others, who deny the truth when it comes to them, say: \"This is nothing but plain magic"
  34,44,"In fact, neither had We given them books to study, nor had We sent to them any Warner before you"
  34,45,"Those who have gone before them also denied - these Arabs have not received one tenth of what We had granted them - yet when they denied My Messengers, see how terrible was My scourge"
  34,46,"O Prophet say: \"I would ask you one thing. For Allah’s sake! Think individually or consult one another and ponder whether your companion Muhammad is really mad? You yourself will come to the conclusion that he is nothing but a Warner to you to forewarn you of a severe punishment"
  34,47,"Tell them: \"I do not ask you for any recompense, even though what I preach is all in your interest. My reward is only due from Allah and He is a witness over everything"
  34,48,"Say: \"In fact my Lord reveals to me the truth, and He is the Knower of all hidden realities"
