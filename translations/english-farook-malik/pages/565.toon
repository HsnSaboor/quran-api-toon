quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  68,16,Soon We shall brand him on the snout
  68,17,Surely We shall try them as We tried the owners of the garden when they swore that they would pluck its fruit the next morning
  68,18,without adding any reservation ( such as God willing)
  68,19,So a calamity from your Lord came down upon it while they slept
  68,20,and by the morning it lay as if it had been already harvested
  68,21,At daybreak they called out to one another
  68,22,"saying: \"Go out early to your crop, if you want to pick its fruit"
  68,23,"So they went, whispering to one another"
  68,24,Let no needy person enter upon you in the garden today
  68,25,"Thus they went out, fixed in their stingy resolve (not to give any fruit to the poor people, as if they had the full control over harvesting the fruit)"
  68,26,"But when they saw the garden, they cried: \"Surely we must have lost our way"
  68,27,"Nay, we have become destitute"
  68,28,"The most upright among them said: \"Did I not tell you to glorify Allah? Why did you not glorify Him"
  68,29,"Then they said: \"Glory be to our Lord! Surely we were unjust"
  68,30,and they started blaming one another
  68,31,"Finally they said: \"Woe to us! Surely we had become rebellious"
  68,32,"It may be that our Lord will give us in exchange a better garden than this: surely to our Lord do we make our humble petition"
  68,33,"Such is the punishment in this life; but the punishment in the Hereafter is even greater, if they but knew it"
  68,34,Surely the righteous will be rewarded with gardens of delight by their Lord
  68,35,What do the disbelievers think? Shall We treat the Muslims as We treat the guilty
  68,36,What is the matter with you? What kind of Judgment do you make
  68,37,Or do you have a Book in which you read
  68,38,that you shall be given whatever you choose
  68,39,Or do you have a sworn covenant - a covenant binding on Us till the Day of Resurrection - that you shall have whatever you demand
  68,40,Ask if any of them will vouch for that
  68,41,"Or do they have other gods who could help them against Allah? If so, let them produce their other gods if they are truthful"
  68,42,"On the Day of Judgment, when the dreadful events shall be unfolded, and they shall be asked to prostrate themselves, they shall not be able to do so"
