quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"The believers were asking: \"Why is not a Surah revealed allowing us to fight?\" But when a decisive Surah carrying the order of allowing them to fight is revealed, you saw those in whose hearts was a disease looking at you like the one under the shadow of death. Woe to them"
  47,21,"On their tongues is the promise of obedience and good talk, so if they would have proved their promise with Allah when the final command was given, it would have been better for them"
  47,22,"Now what can be expected of you if you are put in authority, other than to do evil in the land and violate the ties of blood"
  47,23,Such are those whom Allah has cursed and made them deaf and blinded their sight
  47,24,Will they not ponder upon the Qur’an? Are there locks upon their hearts
  47,25,Those who turn back to unbelief after the guidance has become clear are seduced by Satan who gives them false hopes
  47,26,"That is why they said to those who showed an aversion to what Allah has revealed: \"We shall obey you in some matters,\" and Allah knows their secret talks"
  47,27,"Then what will they do when the angels carry off their souls, smiting their faces and their backs"
  47,28,"That will happen because they followed the way that called for the wrath of Allah and hated to adopt the way of His pleasure, therefore He made all their deeds void"
  47,29,Do those in whose hearts is a disease think that Allah will not reveal their malice
