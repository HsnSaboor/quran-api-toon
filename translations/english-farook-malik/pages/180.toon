quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,26,"Call to mind how He gave you shelter when you were a few in number and were oppressed in the land, ever fearing lest the enemy would kidnap you. He made you strong with His help and provided you a safe asylum and gave you pure things for sustenance so that you may give thanks"
  8,27,"O believers! Do not betray the trust of Allah and His Messenger, nor violate your trusts knowingly"
  8,28,"You should know that your wealth and your children are, in fact, a test for you, and that Allah is He with Whom is your mighty reward"
  8,29,"O believers! If you fear Allah He will grant you a criterion (to judge between right and wrong), do away with your sins and forgive you. Allah is the Lord of Mighty Grace"
  8,30,"Remember, how the unbelievers plotted against you. They sought to take you captive or kill you or exile you. They planned - and Allah also planned - Allah is the best planner of all"
  8,31,"Whenever Our revelations are recited to them they say: \"Well, we have heard this. If we wanted we could fabricate the like. These are nothing but the tales of the ancients"
  8,32,"Also remember how they said: \"O Allah! If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky or inflict some dreadful scourge to punish us"
  8,33,But Allah would not punish them while you were present in their midst. Nor does Allah punish people while they are asking His forgiveness
