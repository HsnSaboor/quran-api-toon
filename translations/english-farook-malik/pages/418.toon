quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  33,1,"O Prophet! Fear Allah and do not obey the unbelievers and the hypocrites: certainly Allah is aware and wise"
  33,2,"Follow that which is revealed to you from your Lord: for Allah is aware of what you do"
  33,3,"Put your trust in Allah: for Allah is your all-sufficient protector"
  33,4,"Allah has not put two hearts in a person’s body: nor does He regard your wives whom you divorce through Zihar (divorcing a wife saying: from now on you are as my mother, depriving her conjugal rights yet keeping her like a slave nor letting her marry anyone else) as your mothers: nor does He regard your adopted sons as your sons. These are mere words which you utter with your mouths; but Allah declares the Truth and guides you to the Right Way"
  33,5,"Name your adopted sons after their fathers; that is more just in the sight of Allah, and if you don’t know who their fathers are, then call them as your brothers in faith and your friends. There is no blame on you for an unintentional mistake, but you will be held responsible for what you do with the intention of your hearts; Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  33,6,"The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves and his wives are as their mothers. Blood relatives have a greater claim on one another than the other believers and the Muhajirin (early Muslims who migrated from Mecca to Medina) according to the Book of Allah: although you are permitted to some good (through leaving bequests) for your friends . This has been written in the Book of Allah"
