quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,41,"And O my people! How is it that I call you to salvation, while you call me to the fire"
  40,42,"You bid me to deny Allah and worship other gods I know nothing of; while I bid you to worship the All-Mighty, the All- Forgiving"
  40,43,"No doubt you call me towards those who can be invoked neither in this world nor in the hereafter. In fact, we all have to return back to Allah and the transgressors are the ones who shall go to hell"
  40,44,"So bear in mind what I have told you, I am entrusting my affairs to Allah, surely Allah is ever watchful over His servants"
  40,45,"So Allah saved that believer from all those evil plots that the people devised against him, and the people of Pharoah were overtaken by a horrible scourge"
  40,46,"It is the fire of hell before which they are presented morning and evening, and on the Day when the time of their Judgment will come, it will be commanded: \"Make the people of Pharoah (Pharaoh) to enter the severest punishment"
  40,47,"Then imagine that time when these people will start arguing with each other in the fire, and the weak followers will say to the arrogant leaders: \"We were your followers: can you now save us from some of these flames"
  40,48,"The arrogant leaders will reply: \"We are all in it together! Allah has already judged between His servants"
  40,49,"Also imagine when the dwellers of fire will ask the Keepers of hell: \"Pray to your Lord for relieving our punishment at least for one day"
