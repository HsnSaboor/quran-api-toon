quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  7,160,"We divided them into twelve tribes, as nations; and when his thirsty people asked him for water, We revealed to Moses: \"Strike the rock with your staff.\" Thereupon twelve springs gushed out from the rock, each tribe was specified its drinking place. We caused the clouds to cast shadow over them and sent down to them manna and salva for their food, saying: \"Eat of the pure things We have provided for you,\" but they rebelled and by doing so they did not harm Us but they did injustice to their own souls"
  7,161,"When it was said to them: \"Reside in this town and eat therein whatever you please and say ‘Hittatun’ (forgive us) and enter the gate in a posture of humility; We will forgive you your sins and increase all the more the reward for such righteous people"
  7,162,"But the wicked among them changed that word which was said to them, as a result We sent down a scourge upon them from heaven for their wrong doings"
  7,163,"Ask them, about the town which was situated on the sea shore, what happened when they transgressed in the matter of Sabbath. On the day of their Sabbath the fish appeared before them on the surface of the water but on the days other than their Sabbath they never came near them; thus did We tempt them because they transgressed"
