quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the fig and by the olive
  95,2,by the mount of Sinai
  95,3,and by this city of peace (Mecca)
  95,4,We have indeed created man in the best stature
  95,5,then We abase him to the lowest of the low
  95,6,except those who believe and do good deeds - for they shall have a never ending reward
  95,7,"So, what causes them to disbelieve you concerning the Day of Judgment"
  95,8,Is not Allah the best of all judges
  96,1,Recite! (or read!) In the name of your Lord Who created
  96,2,created man from clots of blood
  96,3,Recite! Your Lord is the Most Gracious
  96,4,Who taught by the pen
  96,5,taught man what he knew not
  96,6,"Nay! Indeed, man transgresses all bounds"
  96,7,in thinking himself to be self-sufficient
  96,8,although surely towards your Lord is his return
  96,9,Have you seen the one (Abu Jahl) who forbids
  96,10,Our servant from offering Salah (prayer)
  96,11,"Have you considered, if He was on the right guidance"
  96,12,"or was enjoining true piety, why he would forbid someone from prayer"
  96,13,"Have you considered, if he denies the truth and turns away, what will happen"
  96,14,Does he not know that Allah is observing all things
  96,15,"Nay! Let him know that if he does not stop, We will drag him by the forelock"
  96,16,"a lying, sinful forelock"
  96,17,So let him call his supporters for help
  96,18,We too shall call the guards of hell to deal with him
  96,19,Nay! Do not obey him! Prostrate yourself and bring yourself closer to your Lord
