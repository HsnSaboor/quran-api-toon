quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,71,"Quote to them the story of Noah when he said to his people: \"O my people! If it offends you that I should live among you and preach to you the revelations of Allah, then you should know that I have put my trust in Allah. Go ahead and muster all your shoraka' (deities you worship) and come up with your united decision. Plan it well so that you may not have any doubt about its being foolproof. Then execute it against me and give me no respite"
  10,72,"If you have turned away from my message, I did not lose any thing, for I did not ask any reward from you for my services: my reward is only with Allah, I have been commanded to become a Muslim"
  10,73,"But they disbelieved him. As a result, We saved him and those of them who were with him in the Ark and We made them successors in the Earth and drowned those who rejected Our revelations. You see what was the end of those who were warned but did not believe"
  10,74,"Then after him We sent Messengers to their descendants. They came to them with clear signs but they would not believe what they had rejected before. Thus, do We set seals upon the hearts of those who (intentionally) exceed the limits"
  10,75,"Then later on We sent Moses and Haroon (Aaron) to Pharoah (Pharaoh) and his chiefs with Our signs. But they showed arrogance, for they were a guilty nation"
  10,76,"When the truth did come to them from Us they said: \"This is indeed sheer magic"
  10,77,"Moses replied: \"Is this what you say of the Truth when it has come to you? Is this a magic? Magicians do not prosper"
  10,78,"They said: \"Have you come to turn us away from the faith of our forefathers in order that you two (Moses and Haroon) may become the leaders in the land? We will never believe in you"
