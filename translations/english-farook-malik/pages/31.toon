quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,197,"Hajj is in the well known months. One who undertakes to perform it must abstain from husband-wife relationship, obscene language, and wrangling during Hajj. Whatever good you do, Allah knows it. Take necessary provisions with you for the journey, and piety is the best provision of all. Fear Me, O People endowed with understanding"
  2,198,"There is no blame on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord during this journey. When you return from Arafat, (stop at Muzdalifah and) praise Allah near Mash‘ar-al-Har’am. Praise Him as He has guided you, for before this you were from the people who had lost the Right Way"
  2,199,"Then return from where the others return and ask Allah’s forgiveness; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  2,200,"When you have fulfilled your sacred duties, praise Allah as you used to praise your forefathers or with deeper reverence. There are some who say: \"Our Lord! Give us abundance in this world.\" Such people will not have any share in the hereafter"
  2,201,"But there are others who say: \"Our Lord! Give us the good life, both in this world and in the Hereafter and save us from the torment of the fire"
  2,202,"Such people shall have their due share in both worlds according to what they have earned, Allah is swift in settling all accounts"
