quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  10,79,"Pharoah said: \"Bring me every skillful magician"
  10,80,"When the magicians came, Moses said to them: \"Throw what you wish to throw"
  10,81,"So when they had thrown, Moses said: \"The magic that you have brought, Allah will surely prove it wrong: for Allah does not promote the work of mischief makers"
  10,82,"By His Words Allah vindicates the truth, much as the criminals may dislike it"
  10,83,"None but a few youth from his own people believed in Moses, because of the fear of Pharoah (Pharaoh) and his chiefs, lest they should persecute them; and certainly Pharoah was mighty in the land and the one who did not hesitate to transgress any limit"
  10,84,"Moses said: \"O my people! If you sincerely believe in Allah, then put your trust in Him, if you are really Muslims"
  10,85,"They replied: \"In Allah do we put our trust. Our Lord! Do not let us suffer at the hands of unjust people"

  10,87,"We revealed Our will to Moses and his brother, saying: \"Take your people to dwell in Egypt, and make your houses as your Qiblah (places of worship) and establish Salah and give good news to the believers"
  10,88,"Moses prayed: \"Our Lord! You have indeed bestowed on Pharoah and his chiefs splendor and wealth in this worldly life. Our Lord, have you done this so that they may mislead people from Your way? Our Lord, destroy their wealth and harden their hearts, so that they may not believe until they see the painful punishment"
