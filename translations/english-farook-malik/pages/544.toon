quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  58,12,"O believers! When you want to consult the Messenger in private, offer something in charity before your consultation, that is best and purest for you. But if you lack the means, know that Allah is Oft- Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  58,13,"Do you hesitate to give out in charity before your private consultation with him? If you cannot afford it - Allah will forgive you - so establish Salah and pay Zakah, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah is well aware of all your actions"
  58,14,Have you not seen the ones who have befriended those people who are under the wrath of Allah? They are neither on your side nor yet on theirs and they knowingly swear to falsehood
  58,15,Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment; evil indeed is what they are doing
  58,16,"They use their oaths as shields, and debar others from the Way of Allah. They shall have a humiliating punishment"
  58,17,Neither their riches nor their sons shall avail them anything against Allah. They shall be the inmates of hell and live there forever
  58,18,"On the Day when Allah will raise them all to life, they will swear to Him as they now swear to you, thinking that their oaths will help them. By no means! Surely they are the liars"
  58,19,"Satan has gained possession of them, and caused them to forget Allah’s warning. They are the party of Satan. Beware! Surely it is the party of Satan that shall be the loser"
  58,20,Those who resist Allah and His Messenger will be among the most humiliated
  58,21,"Allah has decreed: \"It is I and My Messengers who will most certainly prevail.\" Surely Allah is All- Powerful, All-Mighty"
