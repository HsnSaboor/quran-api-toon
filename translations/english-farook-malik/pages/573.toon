quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,Surely there are some among us who are Muslims and some who are deviators from the truth. Those who have adopted Islam have found the way to salvation
  72,15,and those who have deviated from the truth will become the fuel for hell
  72,16,"O Prophet, say: \"If they (the Meccans) had steadfastly followed the Right Way, We would have certainly vouchsafed them abundant water"
  72,17,"and thereby put them to test. He that gives no heed to the warnings of his Lord, shall be made to undergo severe punishment"
  72,18,"Mosques are built for Allah’s worship; therefore, invoke not anyone along with Allah"
  72,19,"Yet, when Allah’s servant Muhammad stood up to invoke Him, they (unbelievers) were ready to attack him"
  72,20,"O Prophet, say: \"I pray only to my Lord and worship none besides Him"
  72,21,"Say: \"I have no control to cause harm or bring you to the Right Way"
  72,22,"Say: \"If I were to disobey Him, no one can protect me from Allah, nor can I find any refuge besides Him"
  72,23,"My mission is only to deliver what I receive from Allah and make His messages known. As for those who disobey Allah and His Messenger, they shall be put in the fire of hell to live therein forever"
  72,24,"When they shall see the punishment that they are being threatened with, then they shall find out whose helpers are weak and whose supporters are fewer in number"
  72,25,"Say: \"I do not know whether the punishment that you are threatened with is near or whether my Lord has set for it a distant term"
  72,26,He Alone knows the unseen. He does not reveal His secrets to anyone
  72,27,"except to the Messenger whom He may choose for that purpose, and then He appoints guards, who march before him and behind him"
  72,28,so that He may know that they have indeed delivered the messages of their Lord. He also encompasses all their surroundings and keeps a count of each and everything
