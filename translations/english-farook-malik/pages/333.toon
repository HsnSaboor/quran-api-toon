quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  22,6,"This is because Allah is the Reality: it is He Who gives life to the dead and it is He Who has power over everything"
  22,7,and this is a proof that the Hour of Doom is sure to come there is no doubt about it; and that Allah will raise up those who are in the graves
  22,8,"Yet there are others among people who wrangle about Allah, though they neither have knowledge nor guidance, nor an enlightening Book"
  22,9,"twisting things around in order to lead others astray from the Path of Allah - for such persons there is disgrace in this life, and on the Day of Judgment we shall make them taste the punishment of burning fire"
  22,10,"saying: \"This is what you prepared and sent forth with your own hands.\" Rest assured that Allah is not unjust to His worshippers"
  22,11,"There are some people who worship Allah standing on the verge of faith (half faith and half disbelief). When such a person is blessed with good fortune he is content; but if he encounters a trial he turns back headlong; thus losing both this world and the Hereafter, which is a clear-cut loss"
  22,12,"Then instead of Allah, he starts calling those deities who can neither harm nor help him; now that is going too far off in deviation from the Right Way"
  22,13,He is calling upon those who are more likely to harm than help; what an evil master and what an evil friend he chooses for help
  22,14,"As for those who believe and do good deeds, Allah will admit them to gardens beneath which the rivers flow. Surely Allah does what He wants"
  22,15,"If anyone thinks that Allah will not help His Messenger in this world and in the Hereafter, let him stretch out a rope to the sky if he can and cut a hole to peep through and see for himself whether his device can avert that which irritates him"
