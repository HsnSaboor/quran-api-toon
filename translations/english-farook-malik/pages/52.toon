quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,16,"The righteous people are those who pray: \"Our Lord! We sincerely believe in You: please forgive our sins and save us from the agony of the hellfire"
  3,17,"who are steadfast, sincere, obedient, and charitable, and who pray for forgiveness in the morning time"
  3,18,"Allah Himself has testified to the fact that there is no god but Him and so do the angels and those who are well grounded in knowledge standing firm on justice. There is no Ilah (God) except Him, the Mighty, the Wise"
  3,19,"Surely the only Deen (true religion and the Right Way of life) in the sight of Allah is Al-Islam. Those to whom the Book was given did not adopt ways different than this except out of envy among themselves, and after true knowledge had come to them. They should know that Allah is swift in calling to account those who deny His revelations"
  3,20,"So if they argue with you (O Muhammad), tell them: \"I have submitted myself entirely to Allah and so have those who follow me.\" Then ask those who are given the Book and those who are illiterate: \"Will you also submit yourselves to Allah?\" If they become Muslims they shall be rightly guided but if they turn back, you need not worry, because your sole responsibility is to convey the Message. Allah is watching all His servants very closely"
  3,21,"Give a warning to those who deny Allah’s revelations, who slay the Prophets without any justification, and who kill those from among the people who enjoin justice, that there is a painful punishment for them"
  3,22,"They are the ones whose deeds will become void in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers"
