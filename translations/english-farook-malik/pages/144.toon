quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,125,"Whomever Allah wills to guide, He opens his chest to Islam and whomever He intends to confound, He makes his chest narrow and squeezes so tight that, at the very idea of Islam, he feels as if his soul is going to climb up towards the sky. That is how Allah places a blight on those who do not believe"
  6,126,whereas in fact this way (Al-Islam) is the Right Way of your Lord and We have spelled out Our revelations very clearly for the people who use their common sense
  6,127,For them there will be a home of peace with their Lord. He will be their protector because of their good deeds
  6,128,"On the Day when He will assemble them all together, (Allah will address the Jinns): \"O assembly of Jinns! You seduced mankind in great number.\" And their votaries from among mankind will say: \"Our Lord, we have both enjoyed each other's fellowship but alas! Now we have reached the end of our term which You had decreed for us.\" Then Allah will say: \"Now hellfire is your dwelling-place; you will live therein forever unless Allah ordains otherwise.\" Surely your Lord is Wise, Knowledgeable"
  6,129,"That is how, in the hereafter, We will make wrongdoers the comrades of one another on account of what they earned during their life on Earth with evil friendship"
  6,130,"At that time Allah will also ask: \"O Assembly of Jinns and mankind! Did not there come to you the Messengers from amongst you who proclaimed to you My revelations and warned you about the meeting of this Day?\" They will reply: \"Yes they did, We bear witness against our own souls.\" Today this worldly life has deceived them but on that Day they will testify against themselves that they were indeed kuffar (unbelievers)"
  6,131,Your Lord would not destroy towns without just cause while their residents were ignorant of the Reality
