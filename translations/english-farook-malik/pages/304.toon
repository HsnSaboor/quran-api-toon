quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  18,98,"He said: \"This is a blessing from my Lord. But you should know that when the promise of my Lord shall come to pass, He will level it to the ground, for the promise of my Lord is ever true"
  18,99,On that Day We shall let the people loose to surge like waves on one another. The trumpet will be blown and We shall assemble the mankind all together
  18,100,We shall spread Hell out on display before the unbelievers
  18,101,who had turned a blind eye to My admonition and a deaf ear to My warning
  18,102,"Do the unbelievers think that they can take my servants as protectors, to save themselves from Hell, instead of Me? Certainly We have prepared Hell for the entertainment of such unbelievers"
  18,103,"O Muhammad tell them: \"Should we tell you the worst kind of losers relating to their deeds"
  18,104,"Those whose all efforts in this worldly life had gone astray from the Right Way, but all along they were under the delusion that they were doing good deeds"
  18,105,"they are the ones who are disregarding the revelations of their Lord and the fact that they will meet Him for accountability of their deeds in the Hereafter, so their deeds will become null and will not carry any weight on the Day of Judgment"
  18,106,Thus the reward of such people will be Hell; because they had no faith and because they took My revelations and My Messengers as a joke
  18,107,"However, those who believe and do good deeds, they will be entertained with the Gardens of Paradise"
  18,108,to live therein for ever and they will never desire to go anywhere else
  18,109,"O Muhammad tell them: \"If the ocean were ink with which to write the words of my Lord, the ocean would surely be consumed before the words of my Lord are finished, even if We brought similar quantity of ink to replenish it"
  18,110,"O Muhammad, tell them: \"I am but a human being like you; the revelation is sent to me to declare that your God is One God; therefore, whoever hopes to meet his Lord, let him do good deeds and join no other deity in the worship of his Lord"
