quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,116,"Those who reject Faith,- neither their possessions nor their (numerous) progeny will avail them aught against Allah. They will be companions of the Fire,- dwelling therein (for ever)"
  3,117,"What they spend in the life of this (material) world may be likened to a wind which brings a nipping frost: It strikes and destroys the harvest of men who have wronged their own souls: it is not Allah that hath wronged them, but they wrong themselves"
  3,118,"O ye who believe! Take not into your intimacy those outside your ranks: They will not fail to corrupt you. They only desire for you to suffer: Rank hatred has already appeared from their mouths: What their hearts conceal is far worse. We have made plain to you the Signs, if ye have wisdom"
  3,119,"Ah! ye are those who love them, but they love you not,- though ye believe in the whole of the Book. When they meet you, they say, \"We believe\": But when they are alone, they bite off the very tips of their fingers at you in their rage. Say: \"Perish in your rage; Allah knoweth well all the secrets of the heart"
  3,120,"If aught that is good befalls you, it grieves them; but if some misfortune overtakes you, they rejoice at it. But if ye are patient and do right, not the least harm will their cunning do to you; for Allah Compasseth round about all that they do"
  3,121,"(Remember that morning) thou didst leave thy household (early) to post the faithful at their stations for battle: And Allah heareth and knoweth all things"
