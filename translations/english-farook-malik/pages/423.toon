quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,It is not fitting for a believing man or a believing woman to have an option in their affairs when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger; and whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has indeed strayed into a clearly wrong path
  33,37,"O Prophet, remember when you said to the one (Zaid, Prophet's adopted son) whom Allah as well as you had favored: \"Keep your wife in wedlock and fear Allah.\" You sought to hide in your heart what Allah intended to reveal; you were afraid of the people whereas it would have been more appropriate to fear Allah. So when Zaid divorced his wife, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there remains no hindrance for the believers to wed the wives of their adopted sons if they divorced them. And Allah’s Command had to be carried out"
  33,38,There can be no blame attached to the Prophet for doing what is sanctioned for him by Allah. Such has been the way of Allah with those who have gone before; and the decrees of Allah are preordained
  33,39,"Those who are charged with the mission of conveying the message of Allah are to fear Him, they are supposed to fear none but Allah; for Allah is sufficient to settle their account"
  33,40,Muhammad is not the father of any of your men (he is not going to leave any male heirs). He is the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets. Allah has the knowledge of all things
  33,41,O believers! Remember Allah as a frequent remembrance
  33,42,and glorify Him morning and evening
  33,43,"It is He Who sends His blessings on you (believers) and so do His angels, that He may bring you out of darkness into light, for He is Merciful to the believers"
