quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  12,31,"When she heard about these remarks, she invited them and prepared for them a banquet, and gave each of them a knife. When they were engaged in cutting fruit, she asked Joseph to come out before them. When they saw him, they were so amazed that they cut their hands and exclaimed spontaneously: \"Good Lord! He is no human being; he is but a noble angel"
  12,32,"She said: \"Well, this is he about whom you blamed me. No doubt I seduced him, but he escaped. If he doesn’t do what I say, he will certainly be thrown into prison and be disgraced"
  12,33,"Joseph said: \"O my Lord! I would rather go to prison than that to which they invite me; and unless You ward off their cunning snare from me, I may, in my youthful folly, feel inclined towards them and become one of the ignorant"
  12,34,Thereupon his Lord granted his prayer and warded off their cunning snare from him; surely He hears all and knows all
  12,35,"Still, even after all the evidence they had seen (of his innocence and the guilt of their women), they thought it proper to send him to prison for a while"
  12,36,"MidEastWeb for Coexistence http:www.mideastweb.org 111 Two young men also entered the prison along with him. One day one of them said: \"I saw in a dream that I was pressing wine.\" The other said: \"I saw in a dream that I was carrying bread on my head, of which birds were eating.\" Tell us the interpretation of these dreams, for we see that you are a man of virtue"
  12,37,"Joseph replied: \"I will, with Allah’s permission, tell you the interpretation of these dreams before you are served the food you eat, this is part of the knowledge which my Lord has taught me. In fact, I have forsaken the faith of those people who do not believe in Allah and even deny the hereafter"
