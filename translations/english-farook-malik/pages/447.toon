quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,25,What is the matter with you today that you do not help each other
  37,26,Nay! On that Day they shall all be submissive
  37,27,Some of them will step forward to question one another
  37,28,"The followers will say to their leaders: \"It was you who used to come at us from the right hand and forced us towards the wrong way"
  37,29,"They will reply: \"Nay! But it was you who had no faith"
  37,30,"We had no power over you, the fact is that you were an inordinate people"
  37,31,"true is the verdict which Our Lord has passed upon us, we shall indeed taste the punishment of our sins"

  37,48,"And beside them there will be bashful, dark big beautiful-eyed virgins"
  37,49,as if they were delicate eggs closely guarded
