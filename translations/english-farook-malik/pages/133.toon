quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,45,Thus We cut off the roots of the wrongdoers. All praises are due to Allah the Lord of the worlds
  6,46,"Ask them: \"Just think, if Allah takes away your hearing and your sight and seals up your hearts, is there any deity other than Allah who could restore them to you?\" See how We present Our revelations over and over again and yet they turn away"
  6,47,"Say: \"Just think if the punishment of Allah comes to you whether suddenly or openly, would any be destroyed other than the wrongdoers"
  6,48,"We have sent the Messengers only to give good news and to warn: so those who believe and mend their ways shall have nothing to fear or to regret"
  6,49,But those who deny Our Revelations shall be punished for their transgression
  6,50,"Say: \"I do not claim that I possess the treasures of Allah, or that I know the unseen nor do I claim that I am an angel. What I say is that I follow only that which is revealed to me.\" Ask them: \"Are the blind and the seeing alike? Why don’t you think"
  6,51,"O Muhammad, admonish with this (The Qur'an), those who have the fear of being assembled before their Lord in such a condition that there will be no one to protect them or intercede on their behalf other than Him. It may be that, by this admonition, they may become righteous"
  6,52,"Do not drive away those (poor people like Bilal, Ammar and Suhaib) who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking only to gain His favor. You are in no way accountable for their deeds nor they are in any way accountable for yours. So if you drive them away, you shall be counted among the wrongdoers"
