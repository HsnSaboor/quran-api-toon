quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,that this is indeed a Glorious Qur’an
  56,78,inscribed in a well-guarded Book
  56,79,which none can touch except the purified (angels)
  56,80,a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
  56,81,Would you scorn a scripture such as this
  56,82,and make it’s denying a means of your livelihood
  56,83,Why is it not then that when you see a dying person’s soul come up to his throat
  56,84,while you are helplessly watching
  56,85,"and at that time We are nearer to him than you, although you cannot see Us"
  56,86,Then why do you not - if you claim you are not subject to reckoning
  56,87,"restore to the dying person his soul? Answer this, if what you say be true"
  56,88,Then if the dying person is one of those near to Us
  56,89,"for him there is comfort and bounty, and a garden of bliss"
  56,90,And if he be one of the right hand
  56,91,"he is greeted with salutation: \"Peace be upon you,\" from those of the right hand"
  56,92,And if he is one of the mistaken rejecters
  56,93,he is welcomed with scalding water
  56,94,and burning in hellfire
  56,95,Surely this is an absolute truth
  56,96,"Therefore, glorify the name of your Lord, Who is the Greatest"
  57,1,"All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah, and He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise"
  57,2,To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; it is He Who gives life and causes death; and He has power over all things
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last, the Evident and the Immanent, and He has the knowledge of all things"
