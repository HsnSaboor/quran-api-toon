quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  7,179,"Certainly, We have destined many Jinns and human beings for hell; those are the ones who have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, they have ears with which they do not hear. They are like animals - or even worse than them , because they are those who are heedless"
  7,180,"Allah has the most excellent names (over ninety-nine attributes); call on Him by them ; and shun those people who use profanity in His Names, such people shall be requited for their misdeeds"

Tell them: \"The knowledge about it rests only with Allah though most people do not understand"
