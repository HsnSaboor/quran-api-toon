quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"When they (monks and priests) listen to that which is revealed to the Messenger, you can see their eyes filled with tears, because they recognize the truth. They say: \"Our Lord! We believe, therefore, write us down among the witnesses of truth"
  5,84,Why should not we believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us? Why should we not hope that our Lord will admit us to the company of the righteous
  5,85,And for their prayer Allah has rewarded them with gardens beneath which rivers flow to live therein forever. Such is the recompense of the righteous (who do good to others)
  5,86,"As for those who reject and deny Our revelations, they shall become the inmates of hellfire"
  5,87,O believers! Do not make unlawful those wholesome things which Allah has made lawful for you. Do not transgress; Allah does not love the transgressors
  5,88,"Eat of the lawful and wholesome things which Allah has provided for you. Fear Allah, in Whom you believe"
  5,89,"Allah will not call you to account for what is inadvertent in your oaths. But He will hold you accountable for that which you solemnly swear. The penalty for a broken oath is to feed ten indigent persons with such food as you normally provide to your own family, or to clothe ten needy people, or to free one slave. The one who cannot afford any of these must fast three days. This is the expiation for breaking your oaths. Therefore, be mindful of your oaths. Thus Allah makes clear to you His revelations that you may be thankful"
