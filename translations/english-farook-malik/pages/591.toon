quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the heaven and by the morning star (visitant by night)
  86,2,and what will explain to you what the visitant by night is
  86,3,It is the star of piercing brightness
  86,4,"(Just as Allah Almighty is taking care of each star in the galaxies, similarly) over each soul there is an appointed guardian angel"
  86,5,Let man consider from what he is created
  86,6,He is created from an emitted fluid
  86,7,that is produced from between the loins and the ribs
  86,8,"Surely He, the Creator, has the power to bring him back to life"
  86,9,on the Day when the hidden secrets will be brought to scrutiny
  86,10,then he will have neither power of his own nor any helper to save him from the punishment of Allah
  86,11,By the sky which sends down rain
  86,12,and by the earth which is ever bursting with new growth
  86,13,surely this Qur’an is a decisive word
  86,14,and it is no joke
  86,15,These unbelievers of Mecca are plotting a scheme
  86,16,"and I, too, am plotting a scheme"
  86,17,"Therefore, leave the unbelievers alone. Leave them alone for a while"
  87,1,"Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High"
  87,2,Who has created all things and perfected them
  87,3,Who has set their destinies and guided them
  87,4,Who brings forth green pasture
  87,5,then reduces it to black rubbish
  87,6,Soon We shall make you recite Our revelations so you shall forget none of them
  87,7,except what Allah wills. Surely He knows what is open and what is hidden
  87,8,We shall make it easy for you to follow the easy way
  87,9,"Therefore remind, surely reminder does benefit"
  87,10,He who fears Allah will heed the reminder
  87,11,and he who is unfortunate will avoid it
  87,12,"The one who will avoid, shall burn in the gigantic fire"
  87,13,where he shall neither die nor live
  87,14,The one who will take admonition and purify himself shall be successful
  87,15,who remembers the name of his Lord and prays
