quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"who used to ask: ‘Are you really of those who affirm (the message of Islam)"
  37,53,"When we are dead and turned to dust and bones, shall we ever be brought to judgement?’"
  37,54,"It will be said: \"Would you like to see him"
  37,55,He will look down and see his friend in the midst of hellfire
  37,56,"Then he will say: \"By Allah! You had almost ruined me"
  37,57,"Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I should certainly have been among those who are brought there"
  37,58,Is it not so that we shall not die
  37,59,after our first death and that we shall not be chastised
  37,60,Most surely it is a mighty achievement
  37,61,"For such an end, let every one strive who wishes to strive"
  37,62,Is this a better entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum
  37,63,Surely We have made this tree a trial for the wrongdoers
  37,64,Surely it is a tree that grows in the bottom of the hellfire
  37,65,bearing fruits as if they were heads of Satans
  37,66,on it they shall feed and with it they shall fill their bellies
  37,67,"Then on top of that, they will be given a concoction made from boiling water"
  37,68,Then to hellfire they shall be returned
  37,69,"In fact, they found their fathers on the wrong path"
  37,70,and they are eagerly following their footsteps
  37,71,Most of the ancients went astray before them
  37,72,though We had sent Warners to them
  37,73,"See what was the end of those who had been forewarned: they all perished"
  37,74,except the sincere devotees of Allah
  37,75,Noah prayed to Us; see how excellent was Our response to his prayer
  37,76,We delivered him and his people from the mighty distress
