quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  13,35,"As for the paradise which the righteous have been promised, it is like this: rivers flow beneath it; eternal are its fruits, and eternal are its shades; such is the reward of the righteous. But the reward of unbelievers is the fire"
  13,36,"O Prophet, some of those to whom We have given the Book rejoice at what is revealed to you, while there are some factions who deny a part of it. Tell them: “I am commanded to worship Allah and to associate none with Him. To Him I invite you and to Him I shall return"
  13,37,"With these instructions, We have revealed this commandment in the Arabic language. Now, if you follow their vain desires after real knowledge has come to you, there will be none to save you or protect you against the wrath of Allah"
  13,38,We have sent forth other Rasools before you and given them wives and children and it was never in the power of a Rasool to show any miracle without the sanction of Allah. For each period there was a Book
  13,39,Allah abrogates and confirms what He pleases - with Him is the Master Copy of the Book
  13,40,"O Muhammad! Whether We let you see, within your lifetime, a part of what We threaten them with or cause you to die before We smite them, your mission is only to deliver the Message and it is for Us to take accountability"
  13,41,"Do they not see that We are gradually reducing the land in their control through curtailing its borders? When Allah commands, there is none to reverse His command and He is swift in taking accountability"
  13,42,Those unbelievers who have passed before them also devised plots; but Allah is the Master of all planning. He knows the actions of every soul. Soon the unbelievers will come to know who will get the home of paradise in the hereafter
