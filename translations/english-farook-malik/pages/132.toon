quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,36,"Surely those who listen accept the Truth. As for the dead (those with closed minds), Allah will bring them back to life, on the Day of Judgment, to be produced in His court"
  6,37,"They ask: \"Why has a sign not been sent down to him from his Lord?\" Tell them: \"Allah is surely able to send down a Sign; but most of them do not understand the wisdom behind it"
  6,38,"If you really want to see the signs of Allah, just look at any animal that walks upon the earth and any bird that flies in the air; they too are the communities like you. We have not left out anything from the Book in determining the courses of their lives. They all shall be gathered before their Lord"
  6,39,"Those who deny Our Revelations are deaf and dumb, living in many layers of darkness. Allah confounds whom He will, and guides to the Right Way whom He pleases"
  6,40,"Ask them to think carefully and answer: \"When you face a disaster or the last Hour approaches you, do you call for help anyone other than Allah? Answer me if you are truthful"
  6,41,"No, on Him Alone you will call, and forget those whom you have set up as His partners; then if He pleases, He relieves you from the affliction about which you have prayed to Him"
  6,42,We did send Messengers before you to other nations and afflicted them with suffering and adversities so that they might learn humility
  6,43,Why did they not humble themselves when the sufferings overtook them? On the contrary their hearts became hardened and Satan made their sinful acts seem fair to them
  6,44,"When they neglected the warning they had received, then, instead of punishment, We opened the gates of every kind of prosperity for them; but just as they were rejoicing in what they were given, We suddenly seized them; lo! They were plunged into despair"
