quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,44,Allah alternates the night and the day; there is indeed a lesson in it for those who possess insight
  24,45,"Allah has created from water every living creature: of them there are some that creep upon their bellies, some that walk on two legs, and yet some that walk on four; Allah creates what He pleases; surely Allah has power over everything"
  24,46,"We have indeed sent down revelations demonstrating the Truth, and Allah guides to the Straight Way whom He pleases"
  24,47,"They say: \"We believe in Allah and the Messenger and we obey,\" but no sooner do they utter these words than some of them turn their backs; these are no believers"
  24,48,"When such people are called to Allah and His Messenger that He may judge between them, behold! A party of them declines to come"
  24,49,"However, if they have the truth on their side, they come to him voluntarily"
  24,50,"Is there a disease in their hearts? Either they are skeptical, or else they fear that Allah and His Messenger will deny them justice. Nay! In fact they are the ones who are the wrongdoers"
  24,51,"The response of the true believers, when they are called to Allah and His Messenger that he may judge between them, is only to say: \"We hear and we obey.\" Such are the ones who will attain felicity"
  24,52,"Only those who obey Allah and His Messenger, have fear of Allah and do good deeds, are the ones who will be the winners"
  24,53,"They solemnly swear by Allah that if you command them, they will go forth leaving their homes. O Muhammad tell them: \"Do not swear; your obedience not your oaths will count; surely Allah is fully aware of what you do"
