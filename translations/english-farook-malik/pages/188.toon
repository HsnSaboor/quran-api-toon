quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,7,"How can there be a treaty with the pagans on the part of Allah and His Messenger except for those with whom you ratified a treaty at the Masjid-al-Haram? So long as they honor it, you also honor: for Allah loves the righteous"
  9,8,"How can you trust them? If they prevail against you, they respect neither treaty nor ties of relationship. They just flatter you with their tongues, but their hearts reject you, and most of them are transgressors"
  9,9,They have sold the revelations of Allah for paltry worldly gain and they have hindered others from His way; indeed evil are the deeds that they have done
  9,10,They neither honor the ties of relationship nor observe the obligations of treaties with the believers; it is they who are the transgressors
  9,11,"However, if they repent, establish Salah and pay Zakah, then they shall be your brethren in Deen (faith and way of life based on Divine guidance): thus do We spell out Our revelations for people of understanding"
  9,12,"But if they violate their treaty once they have sworn it and insult your Deen, then fight with the ringleaders of the unbelief - for their oaths are nothing to them - so that they may be stopped"
  9,13,"Will you not fight against those people who have broken their oaths, conspired to expel the Messenger and were the first to attack you? Do you fear them? Nay, it is Allah Who is more deserving of your fear, if you are true believers"
