  3,102,"O ye who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except in a state of Islám"
  3,103,"And hold fast, all together, by the Rope which Allah (stretches out for you), and be not divided among yourselves; and remember with gratitude Allah's favor on you; for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in love, so that by His Grace, ye became brethren; and ye were on the brink of the pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus doth Allah make His Signs clear to you that ye may be guided"
  3,104,"Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones to attain felicity"

  3,107,"But those whose faces will be (lit with) white,- they will be in (the light of) Allah's mercy: therein to dwell (for ever)"
  3,108,"These are the Signs of Allah. We rehearse them to thee in Truth: And Allah means no injustice to any of His creatures"
