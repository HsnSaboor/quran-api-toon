quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,111,"Even if We had sent to them the angels, made the dead speak to them, and presented all the different things of the world before them as proof, they would have not believed, unless Allah wanted otherwise (and forcing someone to believe is not what He wants): Yet most of them act out of ignorance"
  6,112,"Like this Messenger, We had granted each Messenger his opponents - Satans from among the human beings and Jinns - some of them inspire the others with seductive discourses of deception. If your Lord wanted, they would not have done so. Therefore, neglect them as well as what they invent"
  6,113,"so that the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter may be inclined to what they say, and be pleased with it; and so that they can earn what they wish to earn"
  6,114,"Say: Should I seek a judge other than Allah, when He is the One Who has revealed this Book (The Qur'an) with full details? Those whom We gave the Book, before you, know very well that it is revealed to you from your Lord with the Truth; therefore, you should not be of those who have doubts"
  6,115,"The Words of your Lord have been completed with credibility and justice; there is no way to change His Words. He is the Hearer, the Knower"
  6,116,"If you obey (other than the Messenger, then you should know that) most of the people on earth will lead you away from the Way of Allah, for they follow nothing but guesswork and preach nothing but falsehood"
  6,117,"In fact, your Lord knows best those people who have strayed from His Way and He knows best those who are on the Right Way"
  6,118,So eat of that meat on which Allah’s name has been pronounced if you truly believe in His revelations
