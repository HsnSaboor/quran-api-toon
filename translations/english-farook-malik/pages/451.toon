quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"But they denied him, so they will certainly be called to account"
  37,128,with the exception of sincere devotees of Allah
  37,129,We left his good name among the later generations
  37,130,SaLotation to Ilyas
  37,131,Thus do We reward the righteous
  37,132,He was surely one of Our believing devotees
  37,133,Lot was one of Our Messengers
  37,134,"Behold, We delivered him and his whole family"
  37,135,except an old woman who was among those who remained behind
  37,136,and We destroyed the others
  37,137,Surely you pass by their ruins by day
  37,138,and by night. Will you not use your common sense
  37,139,Jonah was surely one of Our Messengers
  37,140,When he ran to the laden ship
  37,141,"took part in casting of lots, and was condemned"
  37,142,A whale swallowed him for he had become blameworthy
  37,143,Had he not repented and became of those who glorify Allah
  37,144,he would certainly have remained inside its belly till the Day of Resurrection
  37,145,Then We cast him upon a desolate shore in a state of serious illness
  37,146,and caused a gourd plant to grow over him
  37,147,Then We sent him to a nation of one hundred thousand people or more
  37,148,"They believed in him, so We permitted them to enjoy their life for a while"
  37,149,"Just ask the unbelievers: Does it make any sense that their Lord should have daughters while they choose to have sons"
  37,150,Or is it that We created the angels as females and they were present at their creation
  37,151,Surely they invent a lie when they say
  37,152,Allah has children. They are utter liars
  37,153,Would He choose daughters rather than sons
