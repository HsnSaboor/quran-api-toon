quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  11,46,"Allah replied: \"O Noah! In fact he is not of your family; for he is not of righteous conduct. So do not ask Me anything of which you have no knowledge! I admonish you, lest you become one of the ignorant"
  11,47,"Noah said: \"My Lord! I seek refuge in You for asking You that of which I have no knowledge; and unless You forgive me and have mercy on me, I shall surely be lost"
  11,48,"It was said: \"O Noah! Disembark (from the ark) with Our peace and blessings on you and on the peoples who are with you. As for other people, We shall grant them the provisions of life for some time, and if they do not behave righteously, then they shall have a painful punishment from Us"
  11,49,"O Muhammad, these are some of the facts from the unseen history which We have now revealed to you: neither you nor your people knew about it before. So have patience; surely the end is for the righteous"
  11,50,"To the people of ‘Ad We sent their brother Hud. He said: \"O my people! Worship Allah, you have no god but Him; otherwise you are just making things up"
  11,51,O my people! I do not ask you any reward for my services; for none can reward me except my Creator. Will you not then use your common sense
  11,52,And O my people! Seek forgiveness of your Lord and turn to Him in repentance. He will send you from the sky abundant rain and He will add strength to your strength. So do not turn away like criminals
  11,53,"They said: \"O Hud! You have given us no clear proof. We are neither going to desert our gods just on your word, nor we are going to believe in you"
