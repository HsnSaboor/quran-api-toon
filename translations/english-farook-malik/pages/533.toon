  55,41,Because the sinners will be recognized by their faces and they shall be seized by their forelocks and their feet
  55,42,"Then, O jinn and men, which of your Lord’s favors will both of you deny"
  55,43,"It will be said to them: \"This is the hell which the culprits denied"
  55,44,They shall wander to and fro between fire and hot boiling water

  55,46,For those who fear the time when they will have to stand before their Lord there are two gardens
  55,47,"Then, O jinn and men, which of your Lord’s favors will both of you deny"
  55,48,Having shady trees with lush green branches
  55,49,"Then, O jinn and men, which of your Lord’s favors will both of you deny"
  55,50,Each of them will be watered by two flowing springs
  55,51,"Then, O jinn and men, which of your Lord’s favors will both of you deny"
  55,52,In both of them there will be two pairs of every fruit
  55,53,"Then, O jinn and men, which of your Lord’s favors will both of you deny"
  55,54,They will recline on couches upholstered with rich brocade while the fruit of the gardens will be within their easy reach
  55,55,"Then, O jinn and men, which of your Lord’s favors will both of you deny"

  55,64,Densely shaded with dark green trees
  55,65,"Then, O jinn and men, which of your Lord’s favors will both of you deny"
  55,66,In both of them there will be two gushing springs
  55,67,"Then, O jinn and men, which of your Lord’s favors will both of you deny"
