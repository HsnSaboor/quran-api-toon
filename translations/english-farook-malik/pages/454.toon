quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,17,"O Prophet, have patience at what they say, and remember Our servant David, the man of strength, who was frequent in turning to Allah for guidance"
  38,18,We made the mountains join him in Our praises at evening and the sunrise
  38,19,"And the birds, too, with all their flocks, join in singing with him"
  38,20,We strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and sound judgment in speech and decision
  38,21,Have you heard the story of the two litigants who made an entry into his private chamber through climbing over the wall
  38,22,"When they entered in upon David and he became terrified. They said: \"Have no fear, we are two litigants, one of whom has wronged the other. Judge rightly between us and do not be unjust, and guide us to the Right Way"
  38,23,"This man is my brother; he has ninety nine ewes while I have only one ewe. Yet he says: 'Turn her over to me' and he has the means to prevail against me in what he says"
  38,24,"David said: \"He has certainly wronged you in seeking to add your ewe to his flock: in fact many partners are unjust to one another; except those who believe and do good deeds, and they are few indeed.\" While he said this, David realized that We had tested him ( David had shown desire to one of his officers to divorce his wife so that he could marry her even though he already had 99 wives). So he sought forgiveness of his Lord and fell down on his knees and turned to Allah in repentance"
  38,25,So We forgave his error. He will enjoy a place of nearness with Us and an excellent abode
  38,26,"We said: \"O David! We have made you a vicegerent in the earth, so rule among the people with justice and do not follow your own desires lest they mislead you from the Way of Allah. As for those who go astray from the Way of Allah, they shall surely have a severe punishment because of forgetting the Day of Reckoning"
