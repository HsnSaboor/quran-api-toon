quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  49,12,"O believers! Avoid immoderate suspicion, for in some cases suspicion is a sin. Do not spy on one another, nor backbite one another (to say something about another behind ones back that if one hears it, dislikes it). Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Surely you would abhor it. Fear Allah; for Allah is the Accepter of repentance, Merciful"
  49,13,"O mankind! We created you from a single pair of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes that you might get to know one another. Surely the noblest of you in the sight of Allah is he who is the most righteous. Allah is All-Knowledgeable, All-Aware"
  49,14,"The beduin Arabs say: \"We have believed.\" Tell them: \"You have not believed; rather say 'We have become Muslims;' for faith has not yet found its way into your hearts. If you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not deny you the reward of your deeds; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  49,15,"The true believers are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, then never doubt; and make Jihad (exert their efforts) with their wealth and their persons in the cause of Allah. Such are the ones who are truthful in their claim to be the believers"
  49,16,"O Prophet say to those who claim to have believed: \"Do you apprise Allah of your religion? Whereas, Allah knows all that is in the heavens and the earth and He has full knowledge of everything"
  49,17,"They think they have conferred upon you a favor by embracing Islam. Tell them: \"You have conferred upon me no favor by accepting Islam. It was Allah Who has conferred a favor upon you in guiding you to the true faith; admit this, if you are men of truth"
  49,18,Surely Allah knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is watching all your actions
