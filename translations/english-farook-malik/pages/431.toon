quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,23,"No intercession before Allah can avail anyone except for the one for whom He permits. Until when terror will be removed from their hearts, they shall ask the intercessors: \"What has your Lord ordained?\" They will answer: \"The Truth,\" He is the Most High, the Great"
  34,24,"O Prophet, ask them: \"Who provides your sustenance from the heavens and the earth?\" If they do not answer, then say: \"It is Allah! Certainly one of us; either we or you are rightly guided or in manifest error"
  34,25,"Further, tell them: \"You shall not be questioned about our errors nor shall we be questioned about your actions"
  34,26,"Say: \"Our Lord will bring us all together, then He will rightly judge between us. He is the Judge Who knows everything"
  34,27,"Say: \"Show me those whom you have made associate gods with Him. Nay! By no means can you do it. Allah Alone is the Almighty, the Wise"
  34,28,"O Prophet, We have sent you to the entire mankind, to give them good news and forewarn them, but most men do not know"
  34,29,"They ask you: \"When will this promise of resurrection be fulfilled, if you are telling the truth"
  34,30,"Tell them: \"For you the appointment of a day is fixed, which you can neither postpone for a moment nor bring it early"
  34,31,"The disbelievers say: \"We shall never believe in this Qur’an, nor in the scriptures which came before it.\" If you could only see when these wrongdoers will be made to stand before their Lord, tossing accusing words on one another! Those who had been despised as weaklings will say to the arrogant: \"If it were not for you, we would certainly have been believers"
