quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  29,64,"The life of this world is nothing but a pastime and play! It is the life of the hereafter that is the true life, if they but knew it"
  29,65,"If they embark on a ship, and the ship gets into trouble, they call upon Allah, being sincerely obedient to Him; but when He brings them safely to land, they start committing shirk (giving credit for their safe arrival to others)"
  29,66,so that they may become ungrateful for the blessing that We have bestowed on them and enjoy the life of this world! They will soon come to know the result of this behavior
  29,67,"Do they not see that We have made for them a secure sanctuary in the Ka'bah, while the people are being snatched away from all around them? Do they still believe in falsehood and deny the blessings of Allah"
  29,68,And who is more wicked than the one who forges a lie against Allah or rejects the Truth when it reaches him? Is not the hell a fitting abode for such disbelievers
  29,69,"As for those who strive in Our cause, We will surely guide them to Our ways; rest assured that Allah is with the righteous"
  30,1,Alif Lam M'im
  30,2,"The Romans have been defeated (by the Persians, in Syria - A.D. 615; the Prophet Muhammad’s sympathies were with the Romans who were Christians, while the pagan Arabs were on the side of the Persians who were idol worshippers)"
  30,3,"in the neighboring land, but after this defeat, they will soon be victorious"
  30,4,within a few years. The command lies with Allah in the past instance as well as in the future. On that day the believers will rejoice
  30,5,"for the victory of the Romans as well as their own victory against the pagans with the help of Allah. He helps whom He pleases and He is the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful"
