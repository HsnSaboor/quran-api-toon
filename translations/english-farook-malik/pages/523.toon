quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  51,52,"It has been the case that whenever a Messenger came to the peoples before them, they said about him: \"He is a sorcerer or a madman"
  51,53,"Have they transmitted this statement from one generation to the next? Nay, but they are all a rebellious people"
  51,54,"So, O Prophet, ignore them; you are not at fault"
  51,55,"But keep on admonishing them, for admonition is beneficial to the true believers"
  51,56,We have not created jinns and mankind except to worship Me
  51,57,"I require no sustenance from them, nor do I ask that they should feed Me"
  51,58,"Surely it is Allah Who is the giver of all sustenance, the Lord of Power, the Invincible"
  51,59,"Surely those who are wrongdoers, shall have their portion of torment similar to the portion of their predecessors; so let them not challenge Me to hurry it on"
  51,60,"Woe then to the unbelievers, on that Day with which they are being threatened"
  52,1,By the mount Tur (where Moses was given the Torah)
  52,2,and by the Book written
  52,3,on a fine unfolded scroll
  52,4,and by the inhabited House
  52,5,and the elevated canopy (sky)
  52,6,and the surging ocean
  52,7,the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass
  52,8,There shall be none to avert it
  52,9,"On that Day, heaven will shake violently"
  52,10,and the mountain will travel around
  52,11,"On that Day, woe be to the deniers of truth"
  52,12,who are engaged in their useless sports
  52,13,On that Day they shall be driven to the fire of hell with violence
  52,14,"and it will be said to them: \"This is the fire which you denied"
