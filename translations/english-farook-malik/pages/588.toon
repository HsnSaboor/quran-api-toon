quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,Indeed not! The record of the wicked is in Sijjeen (prison register)
  83,8,"what will explain to you, what the Sijjeen is"
  83,9,This is a written book of hell
  83,10,Woe on that Day to the disbelievers
  83,11,who deny the Day of Judgment
  83,12,None denies it except the sinful transgressor
  83,13,"Who, when Our revelations are recited to him, says: \"These are the tales of the ancient peoples"
  83,14,Of course not! In fact their misdeeds have caused a covering on their hearts
  83,15,"Indeed on that Day, they shall be debarred from the vision of their Lord"
  83,16,Then they shall be made to enter the hell
  83,17,"and told: \"This is what you used to deny"
  83,18,"But, surely the record of the righteous is in `Illiyeen (register of exalted ones)"
  83,19,"and what will explain to you, what the `Illiyeen is"
  83,20,This is a written book
  83,21,attested by those who are nearest to Allah (angels)
  83,22,Surely the righteous will be in bliss
  83,23,"reclining on soft couches, looking all around"
  83,24,and you will recognize in their faces the brightness of bliss
  83,25,Their thirst will be quenched with the choicest sealed wine
  83,26,"and the seal will be of musk. Those who wish to excel above others, let them endeavor to excel in this"
  83,27,That wine shall have a mixture of Tasnim
  83,28,"a spring, at which those nearest to Allah will drink"
  83,29,"During their life on earth, the culprits used to mock at the believers"
  83,30,and wink at one another as they passed them by
  83,31,When they returned to their own people they returned jesting
  83,32,"And when they saw the believers, they used to say: \"These are the people who have surely gone astray"
  83,33,although they had not been sent as guardians over them
  83,34,"On that Day, the believers shall be laughing at the unbelievers"
