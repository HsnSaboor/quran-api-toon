quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,62,They swear to you by Allah in order to please you. But it is more fitting that they should please Allah and His Messenger if they are true believers
  9,63,Don’t they know that anyone who opposes Allah and His Messenger shall live forever in the fire of hell? That surely is the worst humiliation
  9,64,"The hypocrites are afraid lest a Surah should be sent down about them revealing to the Muslims what is in their hearts. Say: \"Mock if you will, Allah will surely bring to light all that you fear"
  9,65,"If you ask them, \"what were you talking about?\" They will promptly say: \"We were only jesting and having fun.\" Say: \"What, then! Were you mocking at Allah, His revelations and His Messenger"
  9,66,"Make no excuses now: you have rejected faith after your belief; even if We may pardon some of you who were not serious in participating, We will punish others amongst you, because they are criminals"
  9,67,"The hypocrite men and the hypocrite women, they are all alike. They enjoin what is evil, forbid what is just, and withhold their hands from doing good. They have forgotten Allah; so He has forgotten them. In fact the hypocrites are transgressors"
  9,68,"Allah has promised the hypocrite men, the hypocrite women, and the unbelievers the fire of hell to live therein forever, a sufficient recompense. Allah has cursed them and they shall have a lasting punishment"
