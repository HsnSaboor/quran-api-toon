quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,26,"Finally Pharoah said: \"Let me kill Moses; and let him invoke his Lord! I fear that he may change your religion or that he may cause mischief to appear in the land"
  40,27,"Moses said: \"I have indeed taken refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning"
  40,28,"At this, a believer from among the relatives of Pharoah, who had kept his faith hidden, said: \"Will you kill a man merely because he says: `My Lord is Allah, especially when he has brought you clear signs from your Lord? If he is lying, may his lie be on his head; but if he is speaking the truth, then some of the dreadful things he is threatening you with may very well fall on you. Surely Allah does not guide the one who is a lying transgressor"
  40,29,"O my people! You are the rulers and are dominant in the land today: but who will help us against the scourge of Allah, should it befall us?\" Pharoah said: \"I am pointing out to you only what I see and I am guiding you only towards the right way"
  40,30,"Then the person who was a true believer said: \"O my people! In fact I fear for you the day of disaster like of what befell prior people"
  40,31,"such as the people of Noah, `Ad and Thamud and those who came after them, and Allah does not intend to wrong His servants"
  40,32,And O my People! I fear for you the Day of wailing
  40,33,"when you will turn your backs and flee, when there will be none to protect you from Allah. The one to whom Allah lets go astray, shall have none to guide him"
