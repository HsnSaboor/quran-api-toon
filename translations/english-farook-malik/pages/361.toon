quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  25,12,"When it shall come into their sight, from a long distance, they will hear its raging and roaring"
  25,13,"And when, chained together, they are flung into some narrow space, they will fervently plead for death"
  25,14,"But they will be told: \"Do not plead for one death today, but plead for many deaths"
  25,15,"Ask them: \"Which is better, this hell or the eternal paradise which the righteous are being promised, which will be the reward of their good deeds and also their final destination"
  25,16,"wherein they will live forever and get everything that they wish for: and this is the promise worth praying for, which your Lord is going to fulfill"
  25,17,"On that Day, He will gather all these people together along with the deities whom they worshipped besides Allah, and ask: \"Were it you who misled these servants of Mine, or did they choose to go astray themselves"
  25,18,"Those deities will answer: \"Glory be to You! It was not befitting for us that we could take any guardian besides You, but You let them and their forefathers enjoy the comforts of worldly life until they forgot the Reminder, and thereby became worthless people"
  25,19,"Thus your gods will deny all that you profess today. Then you shall neither be able to avert your punishment nor shall you get any help from anywhere; and everyone among you who is guilty of wrongdoing, We shall make him taste the mighty punishment"
  25,20,"We have sent no Messenger before you, who did not eat or walk through the streets. In fact, We test you by means of one another. Now, will you show patience, for your Lord is Ever Observant"
