quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  40,67,"It is He Who has created you from dust, then from a sperm, then from a leechlike mass, then He delivers you from the womb of your mother as a child, then He makes you grow to reach the age of full strength, then He makes you grow to reach an old age - though some of you die earlier - so that you may complete your appointed term and grow in wisdom"
  40,68,"It is He Who gives you life and causes you to die. It is He Who when He decides to do something, needs only to say: \"Be,\" and it is"
  40,69,Do you not see how those who argue about the revelations of Allah turn away from the Right Way
  40,70,Those who have denied the Book and the Message which We have sent through Our Rasools shall soon come to know the truth when they will be cast into the fire of hell
  40,71,"when, with yokes and chains around their necks, they shall be dragged"
  40,72,through scalding fluid and burned in the fire of hell
  40,73,"Then they shall be asked: \"Where are those gods whom you invoked in worship"
  40,74,"besides Allah?\" They will answer: \"They have forsaken us, now we have come to know that those to whom we used to invoke, were in fact nothing.\" Thus Allah confounds the disbelievers"
  40,75,"It will be said: \"You have met this fate because during your life on earth, you took delight in things other than the truth and you led a wanton life"
  40,76,Now enter the gates of hell to live therein forever. What an evil abode will be for the arrogant
  40,77,"So be patient, O Prophet, Allah's promise is true. Whether We let you witness the evil consequences with which they are being threatened, or We recall you before We smite them, in any case, they shall all return to Us"
