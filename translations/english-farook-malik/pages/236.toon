  12,5,"He replied: \"My dear little son! Do not say any thing about this dream to your brothers, lest they plot an evil scheme against you; for Satan is an open enemy to human beings"
  12,6,"It will happen, as you have seen in your dream, that you will be chosen by your Lord for His work. He will teach you how to interpret visions, and will perfect His favor upon you and the children of Jacob, as He perfected it upon your forefathers Abraham and Isaac before you. Surely your Lord is Knowledgeable, Wise"
