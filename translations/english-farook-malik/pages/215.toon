quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,54,"If every person that has done injustice possessed all that the earth contains, he would be willing to offer it all in ransom to redeem himself if he could. They will regret in their hearts when they see the punishment of Hell. The decision between them will be made with justice and no wrong will be done to them"
  10,55,"Be aware! All that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah. Be aware! The promise of Allah is true, yet most of them do not know"
  10,56,"He is the One Who gives life and causes death, and to Him you shall all return"
  10,57,"O mankind! There has come to you an instruction from your Lord, a cure for whatever (disease) is in your hearts, a guidance and a blessing for the true believers"
  10,58,"Say: \"It is the grace and mercy of Allah (that He has sent this Qur’an), so let the people rejoice over it, for it is better than (the worldly riches) they are collecting"
  10,59,"O Prophet, ask them: \"Have you ever considered that out of the sustenance which Allah has given you, you yourselves have made some things Halal (lawful) and others Haram (unlawful)? Ask them: \"Did Allah permit you to do so, or do you ascribe a false thing to Allah"
  10,60,"What treatment do they think those people will get, who ascribe false things to Allah, on the Day of Resurrection? Indeed Allah is full of grace to mankind, but most of them are not grateful"
  10,61,"No matter what affairs you may be engaged in, what portion from the Qur’an you may be reciting and whatever deeds you may be doing, We are a Witnesses thereof when you are deeply occupied with it: for there is not even an iota of anything in the earth or in the heaven that is hidden from your Lord, neither anything smaller than that nor larger, but is recorded in a Glorious Book"
