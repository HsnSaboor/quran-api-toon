quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,97,"Those whom Allah guides are rightly guided; and those whom He lets go astray, shall find no protector besides Him. On the Day of Judgment We shall gather them all, prone on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf. Hell shall be their abode: whenever its flames die down, We will rekindle for them the fierceness of the fire"
  17,98,"Thus shall they be rewarded: because they rejected Our revelations and said: \"When we are reduced to bones and decayed particles, shall we really be raised to life in a new creation"
  17,99,"Can they not see that Allah Who has created the heavens and the earth has power to create the people like them? He has set a deadline for their lives, there is no doubt about it: yet the wrongdoers refuse to do anything except deny"
  17,100,"Say to them: \"Even if you had all the treasures of my Lord’s blessings at your disposal, you would still hold them back for fear of spending. Man is ever so stingy"
  17,101,"To Moses We gave nine clear signs. Ask the Children of Israel how, when he came to them and Pharoah told him: \"O Moses! I think that you are bewitched"
  17,102,"Moses replied: \"You know it very well that no one except the Lord of the heavens and the earth has sent down these signs as eye-openers, and O Pharoah (Pharaoh), surely I think that you are doomed"
  17,103,"So Pharoah resolved to remove Moses and the Israelites from the face of the earth, but We drowned him and all who were with him"
  17,104,"Thereafter We said to the Children of Israel: \"Settle down in the land and when the promise of the hereafter comes to be fulfilled, We shall assemble you all together"
