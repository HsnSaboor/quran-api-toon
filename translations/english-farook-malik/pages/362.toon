quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,21,"Those who do not expect to meet Us on the Day of Judgement say: \"Why are not the angels sent down to us or why do we not see our Lord?\" Certainly they are too proud of themselves, and have revolted in a great revolt"
  25,22,"On the Day when they see the angels, it will not be a Day of rejoicing for the criminal; rather they will cry: \"May there be a stone barrier between us and the angels of punishment"
  25,23,"Then We shall turn to the deeds which they did, based on their wrong opinions, and render them vain like blown dust"
  25,24,"In contrast, the heirs of paradise shall have the best residence and finest lodging on that Day"
  25,25,On that Day when the heavens shall burst asunder with clouds and the angels will be sent down ranks after ranks
  25,26,"the real Kingdom on that Day will belong only to the Compassionate (Allah), a hard Day shall it be for the unbelievers"
  25,27,"On that Day the wrongdoer will bite his hands saying: \"Oh! Would that I had only taken the pathway alongside the Messenger"
  25,28,Oh! Would that I had never chosen so-and-so for my companion
  25,29,"He was the one who led me astray from the admonition even after it had reached me.\" Satan is ever treacherous to man"
  25,30,"The Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Surely my people took this Qur’an for foolish nonsense"
  25,31,"That is how We made for every Messenger an enemy among the criminals, but your Lord is sufficient for you (O Muhammad) as a Guide and Helper"
  25,32,"The unbelievers ask: \"Why is not the Qur’an revealed to him all in a single revelation?\" This method of slow, well arranged, piecemeal revelations is adopted to strengthen your heart"
