quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,15,"For the people of Saba (Sheba, presently a town in Yeman) there was indeed a sign in their dwelling place: two gardens - one to the right and one to the left. It was said to them: \"Eat of what your Lord has given you and render thanks to Him. Pleasant is your land and forgiving is your Lord"
  34,16,"But they gave no heed. So We let loose upon them the waters of the dam (called Ma'arib) and We converted their two gardens into the gardens producing bitter fruit, tamarisks and a few lote bushes"
  34,17,Thus did We requite them for their disbelief; and never do We punish any but the ungrateful
  34,18,"Between them and the towns which We had blessed (Syria and Palestine), We placed other towns in prominent positions so that they could journey to and fro in measured stages. We said: \"Travel through them by day and night in complete security"
  34,19,"But they prayed: \"Our Lord! Make our journeys longer.\" Thereby they wronged their souls and We made them merely a tale that is told and dispersed them in scattered fragments. Surely there is a sign in this for every patient, grateful person"
  34,20,"In their case, Iblees' (Satan’s) suspicions proved true, as they all followed him except a small group of the believers"
  34,21,even though he had no authority over them. It all happened because We wanted to see who among them believed in the hereafter and who is in doubt concerning it. Your Lord is watching over all things
  34,22,"O Prophet, say to the pagans: \"Call on those deities whom you pray besides Allah they do not have power over an atom’s weight of anything in the heavens or earth, nor have they any share in either, nor is any of them a helper to Allah"
