quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,of what avail will their past enjoyments be to them
  26,208,Never have We destroyed a population to whom We did not send Warners
  26,209,"they were forewarned, and We have never been unjust"
  26,210,This Qur’an is not brought down by the Satans
  26,211,it is neither in their interest nor in their power to produce such a masterpiece
  26,212,They are kept too far off to even hear it
  26,213,"So do not call on other gods besides Allah, lest you become one of those who incur His punishment"
  26,214,Admonish your close relatives
  26,215,and lower your wing of kindness to those of the believers who follow you
  26,216,"but if they disobey, tell them: \"I am not accountable for what you do"
  26,217,"Put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,218,Who observes you when you get up
  26,219,and when you walk among those who prostrate themselves in worship
  26,220,He is the One Who hears all and knows all
  26,221,"Shall I tell you, O people, on whom the Satans descend"
  26,222,They descend on every slandering sinner
  26,223,those who listen to hearsay - and most of them are liars
  26,224,and those poets who are followed by those who go astray
  26,225,"Do you not see, how aimlessly they wander in every valley"
  26,226,preaching what they do not practice themselves
  26,227,"However, an exception is made for those (poets) who believe, do good deeds, engage much in the remembrance of Allah and defend themselves when wronged, showing no vindictiveness. The unjust oppressors will soon find out what vicissitudes their affairs will take"
