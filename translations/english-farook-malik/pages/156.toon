  7,44,"The residents of paradise will call out to the inmates of the hellfire: \"We have indeed found out the promises of our Lord to be true.

  7,45,"who hindered other people from the Way of Allah and sought to make it crooked, and who did not believe in the hereafter"
  7,46,"Between the two, there shall be a veil, and on the A‘raf (heights) there will be people who will recognize them by their features. They will call out to the residents of Paradise: \"Peace be upon you!\" They will not have yet entered it, though they will have the hope"
  7,47,"When their eyes shall turn towards the inmates of the hellfire they will say: \"Our Lord! Do not cast us among these wrongdoers"
