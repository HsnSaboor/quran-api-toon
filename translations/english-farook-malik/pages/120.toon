quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,71,"They thought no affliction would follow; so they acted blind and deaf. Yet Allah, in extreme mercy, accepted their repentance, but again many acted blind and deaf towards the message of Allah. Allah is observant of their actions"
  5,72,"Certainly they have disbelieved who say: \"Allah is Christ the son of Mary.\" While Christ himself said: \"O children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.\" Whoever commits shirk (joins partners with Allah), Allah will deny him the paradise, and the hellfire will be his home. There will be no helper for the wrongdoers"
  5,73,"Certainly they are unbelievers who say: \"Allah is one of three in a Trinity.\" There is no god except One Allah. If they do not stop saying what they say, a painful punishment will befall the disbelievers among them"
  5,74,"Will they not then turn to Allah and seek His forgiveness? Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  5,75,"Christ, the son of Mary, was no more than a Messenger; many Messengers had already passed away before him. His mother was a truthful woman; they both ate earthly food like other human beings. See how the Revelations are made clear to them to know the reality; yet see how they ignore the truth"
  5,76,"Ask them: \"Would you worship besides Allah someone who can neither harm nor benefit you? While Allah is He who hears all and knows all"
