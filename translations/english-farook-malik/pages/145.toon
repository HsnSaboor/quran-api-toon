quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,132,"All will be awarded ranks according to their deeds, and your Lord is not unaware of what they do"
  6,133,"Your Lord is Self-Sufficient, Lord of Mercy. If He wants, He can destroy you all and replace you with others as He pleases, just as He raised you from the offspring of other people"
  6,134,"Surely what you are being threatened with, must come to pass and you can do nothing about it"
  6,135,"O Muhammad, tell them: \"O my people! If you don’t listen to me, do whatever you want and I’ll do whatever I deem right; you will soon find out who is to gain the reward of the hereafter; rest assured that the wrongdoers will not get salvation"
  6,136,"They set aside a share of their produce and of their cattle for Allah, saying: \"This is for Allah\" - so they pretend - \"and this for our shoraka' (their assigned partners of Allah).\" Their shoraka's share does not reach Allah, but the share of Allah is wholly given to shoraka'. What an evil decision they make"
  6,137,"Their shoraka' have induced many pagans to kill their own children in order to ruin them and confuse them in their religion. If Allah wanted, they would not have done so. Therefore, leave them alone with their false inventions"
