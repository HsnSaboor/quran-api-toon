quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,"On that Day, no intercession of any intercessors shall profit them"
  74,49,Then what is the matter with them that they turn away from this admonition
  74,50,Like frightened donkeys
  74,51,fleeing from a lion
  74,52,"Nay, each of them wants a scripture of his own to be unrolled before them"
  74,53,But no! The fact is that they do not fear the Hereafter
  74,54,But no! Surely this Qur’an is an admonition
  74,55,Let him who wills take heed
  74,56,But none takes heed except by the will of Allah. He Alone is worthy to be feared and He Alone is worthy to forgive those who fear Him
  75,1,I swear by the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,and I swear by the self reproaching soul
  75,3,Does man think that We shall not be able to put his bones together
  75,4,"Why not? We are able to put together, in perfect order, the very tips of his fingers"
  75,5,But man wishes to keep on doing evil in the future as well
  75,6,"He questions: \"When will this Day of Resurrection be"
  75,7,"Well, it will come when the sight shall be dazed"
  75,8,the moon will be eclipsed
  75,9,and the sun and the moon will be brought together
  75,10,"on that Day man will ask: \"Is there any way to escape"
  75,11,Nay! There will be no refuge
  75,12,"On that Day, the refuge will only be towards your Lord"
  75,13,"On that Day man shall be told about all his deeds, from the first to the last"
  75,14,"Indeed, man shall bear witness against himself"
  75,15,even though he shall plead with excuses
  75,16,"O Prophet, do not move your tongue too fast to memorize this revelation"
  75,17,"It is Our responsibility to collect it in your memory, and make you recite it"
  75,18,"and when it is recited, to make you follow it"
  75,19,and then it is Our responsibility to explain it
