quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  43,11,The One Who sends down rain from the sky in due measure and thereby resurrects a dead land - that’s how you shall be brought forth (raised to life again)
  43,12,The One Who has created all living things in pairs and made for you the ships and cattle on which you ride
  43,13,"so that you may firmly sit on their backs, then as you mount, recall the goodness of your Lord and say: \"Glory be to Him Who has subjected these to Our use, otherwise We could not have brought them under our control"
  43,14,and to our Lord we shall all return
  43,15,"Yet in spite of recognizing all this, they have made some of His servants to be a part of Him! Surely mankind is clearly ungrateful"
  43,16,Would Allah choose daughters (pagan Arabs believed that angels were the daughters of Allah) for Himself out of what He Himself creates and gives you sons
  43,17,"Yet when a new born-girl - the gender that they ascribe to the Compassionate - is announced to one of them, his face darkens and he is filled with grief"
  43,18,"Do they ascribe to Allah, the female gender who is brought up among trinkets and is unable to make herself clear in disputation"
  43,19,"They regard the angels, who are themselves servants of the Compassionate, as female divinities. Did they witness their creation? They should know that their testimony shall be noted down and they shall be called to account for it"
  43,20,"They say: \"Had it been the will of the Compassionate, We should never have worshipped them.\" They have no knowledge about that; they are merely guessing"
  43,21,Or have We given them a Book before this to which they hold authority for their angel-worshipping
  43,22,"The only argument they have is to say: \"We found our forefathers practicing this faith and we are walking in their footsteps"
