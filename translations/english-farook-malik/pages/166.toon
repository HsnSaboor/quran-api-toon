quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  7,131,"But whenever they had good times they said \"It is our due,\" and whenever evil befell them, they ascribed that bad luck to Moses and those with him. Behold! In fact their misfortune was in the hands of Allah; yet most of them do not know"
  7,132,"They said to Moses: \"No matter what sign you may bring us to put your magic spell, we are not going to believe you"
  7,133,"So We plagued them with storms, locusts, lice, frogs and blood: clear cut signs, yet they persisted in their arrogance, for they were a criminal nation"
  7,134,"Every time the plague befell them, they said: \"O Moses! Pray for us to your Lord as He has made the promise with you, if you help remove the plague from us, we shall truly believe in you and send the Children of Israel with you"
  7,135,"But every time We removed the plague from them and the appointed time for the release of the Children of Israel came, lo! They broke their promise"
  7,136,"Therefore, We inflicted retribution on them and drowned them in the sea, for they denied Our signs and became heedless of them"
  7,137,"Thus We made that nation which was oppressed, the inheritors of the eastern and western lands which We had blessed. That’s how the fair promise of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because they had endured with patience; and We levelled to the ground the great works and fine buildings which Pharoah and his nation had erected with such pride"
