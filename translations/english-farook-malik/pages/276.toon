quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,80,"Allah has made your homes the place for your rest, and animal skins for tents like houses so that you may find them light when you travel and easy to pitch when you stop; while from their wool, fur, and hair He provides you household items and articles of convenience for your prescribed term of life"
  16,81,"Allah has provided you shades from the sun out of what He has created. He has granted you resorts in the mountains, has granted you garments to protect yourselves from heat; and coats of armor to protect you during your wars. Thus He completes his favors to you, so that you may become Muslims"
  16,82,"If they still give no heed to you O Muhammad, you need not worry, for your duty is only to convey the message clearly"
  16,83,"They recognize the favors of Allah, yet they deny them; most of them are ungrateful disbelievers"
  16,84,Do they realize what will happen on that Day when We shall call a witness from every nation? Then the unbelievers will neither be allowed to put forward any excuse nor will they receive any favor
  16,85,"When the wrongdoers face the punishment, it will neither be lightened for them nor will they be granted a delay"
  16,86,"When the pagans see their deities whom they associated with Allah, they will say: \"Our Lord! Here are our ‘associate gods’ whom we used to invoke besides You.\" At this their deities will toss their statement back at them saying: \"You are liars"
  16,87,"They shall tender their submission to Allah that Day: and the gods of their own inventions will leave them in the lurch"
