quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,13,"Do they say: \"He has made up the Qur’an himself.\" Say to them: \"Make up ten Surahs like this and call to your aid whomsoever you can, including your gods whom you worship besides Allah, if what you say is true"
  11,14,"But if those gods fail to answer you, then you should know that (they are false gods and that) this (Book) is revealed with the knowledge of Allah, and that there is no god but Him! Will you then become Muslims"
  11,15,"Those who desire the life of this world and its splendors, they are given full reward of their deeds therein and shall not be diminished"
  11,16,They are the ones who will have nothing in the hereafter except Hellfire. There they shall come to know that their deeds were fruitless and their actions were worthless
  11,17,"Can they be like those who have clear revelations from their Lord and to whom a witness from Himself recites it, and they have the Book of Moses before them - a guidance and a blessing? Can such people deny the revelation of Al- Qur’an? No of course not, rather such people will believe in this, but those factions who do not believe shall have their promised place in the Hellfire. So, O Prophet, do not be in any doubt about it; it is the Truth from your Lord, even though most people do not believe so"
  11,18,"Who can be more wrong than the one who forges a lie against Allah? Such people will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say: \"These are the ones who lied against their Lord.\" Beware! The Curse of Allah is on those wrongdoers"
  11,19,"who hinder others from the path of Allah and seek to make it crooked, and who deny the hereafter"
