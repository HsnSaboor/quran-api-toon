quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  36,71,"Do they not see that among the other things which Our hands have fashioned, We have created cattle which are under their domination"
  36,72,"We have subjected these animals to them, that they may ride on some and eat the flesh of others"
  36,73,in them there are other advantages and drinks (milk) for them. Should they not then be grateful
  36,74,Yet they have taken other gods besides Allah hoping to get their help
  36,75,But they do not have the ability to help them yet their worshippers stand like warriors ready to defend them
  36,76,Let not their words grieve you (O Muhammad). Surely We have knowledge of all that they conceal and all that they reveal
  36,77,Does not man see that We have created him from a sperm? Yet he stands up as an open adversary
  36,78,"He starts making comparisons for Us and forgets his own creation. He says: \"Who will give life to bones that have been decomposed"
  36,79,"Tell them: \"He Who has created them for the first time, will give them life again, He is well-versed in every kind of creation"
  36,80,It is He Who produces for you the spark from the green tree to kindle therewith your own fires
  36,81,"Does He Who has created the heavens and the earth have no power to create the like thereof?\" Of course He does! He is the skilful Creator"
  36,82,"Whenever He intends a thing, He needs only to say: \"Be,\" and it is"
  36,83,Glory be to Him in Whose hands is the Kingdom of all things; and to Whom you shall all be brought back
