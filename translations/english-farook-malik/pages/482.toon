quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"He Alone has the knowledge of the Hour of Doom. No fruit comes out of its sheath, nor does a female conceive, nor she gives birth but with His knowledge. On the Day of Judgment when Allah will ask the unbelievers: \"Where are those partners that you associated with Me?\" They will answer: \"We confess that none of us can vouch for them"
  41,48,Those deities whom they used to invoke will vanish from them and they shall realize that there is no escape
  41,49,"Man is never tired of praying for good, but when any evil befalls him, he loses hope and is in despair"
  41,50,"And if, after affliction, We vouchsafe him a favor from Ourself, he is sure to say: \"I deserve this, I do not think that the Hour will ever come; and even if I am brought back to my Lord, I would still get good treatment from Him.\" The fact, however, is that We shall tell the disbelievers the truth of all that they had done and We shall make them taste a severe punishment"
  41,51,"When We bestow favors on man, he turns away and drifts off to another side; and when an evil befalls him, he comes with lengthy supplications"
  41,52,"O Prophet, ask them: \"Have you ever considered: if this Qur’an is really from Allah and you deny it, who can be more astray than you who have gone too far in defying Him"
  41,53,"Soon shall We show them Our signs in the universe and in their own souls, until it becomes clear to them that this Qur’an is indeed the truth. Is it not enough that your Lord is a witness over everything"
  41,54,Still they are in doubt about meeting their Lord! Yet it is He Who encompasses everything
