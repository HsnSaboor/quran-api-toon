quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  15,16,It is We who have decked the heavens with constellations and made them fair- seeming for the beholders
  15,17,and We have guarded them from every accursed Satan
  15,18,"Any Satan that steals a hearing, there follows him a fiery comet"
  15,19,We have spread out the earth and set mountains upon it; and caused to grow every suitable thing therein
  15,20,and We provided therein means of sustenance for you and many other creatures to whom you do not provide
  15,21,There is nothing which is not in Our inexhaustible treasure and sent down in appropriate measure
  15,22,We send the fertilizing winds and send down water from the sky for you to drink; it is not you who hold the storage of this wealth
  15,23,"Certainly it is We who give life and cause to die, and We are the inheritors of all"
  15,24,Certainly We have full knowledge of those who have gone before you and certainly We know those who will come later
  15,25,"Surely your Lord will gather them together; surely He is Wise, Knowledgeable"
  15,26,"We created man from sounding clay, black mud moulded into shape"
  15,27,while before him We had created Jinn from smokeless fire
  15,28,"Remember when your Lord said to the angels: \"I am about to create a man from sounding clay, black mud moulded into shape"
  15,29,"when I complete his moulding and breath into him of My spirit, kneel down and prostrate before him"
  15,30,Accordingly the angels prostrated altogether
  15,31,except Iblees (The Satan); he refused to join those who prostrated
