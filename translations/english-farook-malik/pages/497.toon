quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  44,19,"Do not hold yourselves above Allah, surely I have brought to you a clear authority"
  44,20,I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord against you injuring me
  44,21,"If you do not believe me, then leave me alone"
  44,22,"But they became aggressive, so Moses prayed to his Lord: \"These are indeed a criminal people"
  44,23,"The reply came: \"Set forth with My servants (Israelites) at night, surely you shall be pursued"
  44,24,"When you have crossed the red sea along with your people miraculously, then leave the sea divided; for they are a host who are destined to be drowned"
  44,25,How many gardens and springs they left behind
  44,26,And agriculture and grand palaces
  44,27,And means of luxury and comfort which they used to enjoy
  44,28,Thus was their end! And We let other people inherit what was once theirs
  44,29,Neither Heaven nor earth sheds tears for them; nor were they given a respite
  44,30,We did deliver the Children of Israel from a humiliating chastisement
  44,31,inflicted by Pharoah who was the most arrogant among such inordinate transgressors
  44,32,"and We chose them, in spite of knowing their weaknesses above the nations of the world"
  44,33,We showed them signs in which there was a clear trial
  44,34,As to these (people of Qureysh) who say
  44,35,There is nothing beyond our first death and we shall not be raised again
  44,36,Are these people better than the people of Tubba and those who were before them? We destroyed them all only because they had become criminals
  44,37,It was not for a sport that We created the heavens the earth and all that lies between them
  44,38,"We have created them to reveal the truth, but most of them do not understand"
  44,39,Surely the Day of sorting out is the time appointed for the resurrection of them all
