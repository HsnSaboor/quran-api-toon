quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,surely he pondered and devised a plot
  74,19,"May he perish, how he plotted"
  74,20,"Again, may he perish, how he plotted"
  74,21,He looked around
  74,22,frowned and scowled
  74,23,then he turned his back in scornful pride
  74,24,"and said: \"This is nothing but a magic from the old"
  74,25,this is nothing but the word of a human being
  74,26,Soon I shall cast him into Saqar
  74,27,"What will make you understand, what Saqar is"
  74,28,It is burning fire which leaves nothing and spares none
  74,29,It shrivels human flesh
  74,30,It is guarded by nineteen guards
  74,31,"We have appointed none but angels as wardens of the fire; and We have made their number a trial for the unbelievers, so that the People of the Book may be convinced and the faith of the true believers may be increased, and that no doubts will be left for the People of the Book and the believers, and that those in whose hearts there is a disease and the disbelievers may say: \"What could Allah mean by this parable?\" Thus, Allah leaves to stray whom He wills and guides whom He pleases. No one knows the forces of your Lord except Himself, and this (Qur'an) is nothing but a reminder to mankind"
  74,32,Nay! By the moon
  74,33,by the departing night
  74,34,and by the coming of dawn
  74,35,surely this hellfire is one of mighty scourge
  74,36,a warning to mankind
  74,37,to any of you who chooses to go forward or to lag behind
  74,38,Every soul is held in pledge for its deeds
  74,39,except the people of the right hand
  74,40,who shall be in paradise. They will ask
  74,41,from the culprits
  74,42,What brought you into hell
  74,43,"They will answer: \"We did not use to offer the Salah (prayers)"
  74,44,we did not use to feed the poor
  74,45,we used to join those who wasted their time in vain talk
  74,46,and we used to deny the Day of Judgment
  74,47,until death overtook us
