quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  64,1,"All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah. To Him belongs the kingdom and to Him is due all praise, He has power over all things"
  64,2,It is He Who has created you; yet some of you are unbelievers and some are believers. Allah is observant of all your actions
  64,3,"He created the heavens and the earth to manifest the truth. He shaped you and shaped you well, and to Him you shall all return"
  64,4,"He knows all that is in the heavens and the earth. He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and Allah knows what is in your breast"
  64,5,"Have you not heard of those who disbelieved before you? So they tasted the evil result of their deeds, and in the Hereafter there shall be a painful punishment for them"
  64,6,"That is because, when their Messengers came to them with clear revelations, they said: \"Are human beings going to guide us?\" So they disbelieved and paid no heed. Allah has no need of such people. Allah is free of all needs, worthy of all praise"
  64,7,"The unbelievers claim that they shall not be raised to life again. Tell them: \"Indeed, by my Lord, you shall surely be raised to life again! Then you shall be told of all that you have done, and that is easy for Allah"
  64,8,"Therefore, believe in Allah and His Messenger, and in the Light which We have revealed. Allah is well aware of all your actions"
  64,9,"The Day when He will gather you all will be the Day of Assembly, which shall be the Day of mutual loss and gain among the people. Those who believe in Allah and do good deeds, He will remove from them their sins and admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever, and that will be the supreme achievement"
