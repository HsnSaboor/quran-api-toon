quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,87,"They preferred to be with those who remain behind, as a result, a seal was set upon their hearts so that they do not understand"
  9,88,"But the Messenger and those who believe with him, make Jihad with their wealth and their persons. They are the ones who will have all the goodness, and they are the ones who will be successful"
  9,89,"Allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever: that is the greatest achievement"
  9,90,"Some from among the desert Arabs also came with their excuses, begging exemption to stay behind; thus, those who lied to Allah and His Messenger sat inactive. Soon a painful punishment shall seize those of them who disbelieved"
  9,91,"There is no blame on the disabled, the sick, and those lacking the means, to stay behind so long as they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger. There is no way (blame) against those righteous people. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  9,92,"Likewise, there is no blame on those who came to you and requested the conveyance to the battlefront and you said: \"I am unable to provide you the conveyance,\" and they returned with their eyes streaming with tears; they were filled with sorrow that they had no resources of going forth to the battlefield at their own expense"
  9,93,The way (blame) is only against those who begged exemption although they are rich. They preferred to be with those who remained behind. Allah has set a seal upon their hearts; so they do not know what they missed
