quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  28,85,"O Prophet, rest assured that He Who charged you with The Qur'an will bring you to the best destination. Say: \"My Lord best knows him who has brought guidance and him who is in manifest error"
  28,86,"You (O Muhammad) never expected that the Book would be revealed to you. Only through your Lord's mercy has it been revealed to you: therefore do not be a helper in any way to the unbelievers"
  28,87,Let no one turn you away from the revelations of Allah now that they have been revealed to you. Invite people to your Lord and be not of the pagans (who join other deities with Allah)
  28,88,Invoke no other god besides Allah. There is no god but Him. Everything is perishable except Him. To him belongs the judgement and to him will you all be returned
  29,1,Alif Lam M'im
  29,2,"Do the people think that they will be left alone on saying \"We believe,\" and that they will not be tested"
  29,3,We did test those who have gone before them. Allah has to see (for the purpose of reward and punishment) who are the truthful and who are the liars
  29,4,Or do the evildoers think that they will escape from Our reach? How bad is their judgment
  29,5,He that hopes to meet Allah must know that Allah’s appointed time is sure to come and He hears all and knows all
  29,6,"He that strives, does that for his own soul; for Allah is certainly transcendent and beyond any need of the worlds"
