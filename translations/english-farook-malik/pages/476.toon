quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,78,"O Prophet, We have sent many Rasools before you; of them there are some whose stories We have relayed to you and others whose stories We have not relayed to you. It was not possible for any of those Rasools to bring a sign except by the leave of Allah. Then when the command of Allah came, the matter was decided with justice, and it was the wrongdoers who suffered the loss"
  40,79,"It is Allah Who has provided you with cattle, that you may use some for riding and some for food"
  40,80,and there are also other advantages in them for you; they take you where you wish to go carrying you on their backs as ships carry you by the sea
  40,81,"Thus, He shows you His signs; then, which signs of Allah you will deny"
  40,82,Those who have denied the Book WORSHIP/DECIPHERMENT have gone before them? They were more in number and superior in strength than these and they have left behind great traces of their power in the land; yet all that they did was of no avail to them
  40,83,"When their Messengers came to them with clear revelations, they proudly boasted about their own knowledge; but the very forewarned scourge at which they mocked, hemmed them in"
  40,84,"When they saw Our scourge, they cried out: \"We believe in Allah, the One and Only, and we reject all those gods whom we used to associate with Him"
  40,85,"But after seeing Our scourge, their professing the faith (Islam) was of no use to them; such was the practice of Allah in dealing with His servants in the past, and thus the disbelievers were lost"
