quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,1,"All praise be to Allah, the One Who has created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light; yet the unbelievers set up equal partners with their Lord"
  6,2,"He is the One Who has created you from clay, then decreed a fixed term of life and set a deadline for you Himself; yet you go on doubting"
  6,3,"He is the same One Allah in both the heavens and the earth. He knows what you conceal, what you reveal and what you do"
  6,4,"Yet the reaction of the people has been that whenever a revelation came to them from their Lord, they neglected it"
  6,5,"Now that the truth has come to them, they have denied it. Soon they will come to know the reality which they are ridiculing"
  6,6,"Have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed before them? We had made those nations more powerful in the land than yourselves. We sent down for them abundant rain from the sky and made the rivers to flow beneath their feet: yet for their sins We destroyed them all and raised up other generations in their places"
  6,7,"O Prophet, if We had sent to you a Book written on paper and they could have touched it with their own hands, the unbelievers would still have said: \"This is nothing but plain sorcery"
  6,8,"They ask: \"Why has no angel been sent down to us?\" Well, if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been settled at once and no respite would have been granted after that"
