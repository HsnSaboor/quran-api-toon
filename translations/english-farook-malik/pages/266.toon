quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  15,71,"He said: \"Here are my daughters, if you must act"
  15,72,"By your life, O Prophet Muhammad, they were madly blundering in their intoxication of lust"
  15,73,So the mighty blast overtook them at sunrise
  15,74,Thus We turned the town upside down and rained down on them brimstones of baked clay
  15,75,Surely there are major lessons in this for those who investigate
  15,76,and this smitten town still lies right on the permanent highway on which the unbelievers travel during their business trips
  15,77,Indeed there is a sign in this for the true believers
  15,78,The people of Al- Aikah (the nation of Prophet Shu’aib) were also wrongdoers
  15,79,So We inflicted retribution on them. The ruined towns of these two nations are lying on an open road
  15,80,The people of Hijr also denied their Messenger
  15,81,"We gave them Our signs, but they ignored them"
  15,82,They hewed their homes in the mountains for safety
  15,83,"But the mighty blast seized them one morning, and all their labor of building their homes through carving the rocks did not avail them"
  15,84,"We have not created the Heavens and the Earth, and all that lies between them but to manifest the Truth"
  15,85,"The Hour of Doom is sure to come, so overlook their misbehavior in a gracious manner"
  15,86,Surely your Lord is the All-Knowing Creator
  15,87,We have given you the Seven Verses that are worthy of recitation over and over again (Surah Al-Fatiha) and the Glorious Qur'an
  15,88,"Do not look at the worldly wealth which We have given to different people among them, nor grieve at their condition. Leave them alone, attend to the believers in kindness"
  15,89,"and tell the unbelievers: \"Surely I am only a plain Warner"
  15,90,This warning is like the warning which We sent down to the schismatics
