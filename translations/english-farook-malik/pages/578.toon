quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,"Nay, the fact is that you people love this fleeting life"
  75,21,and are heedless to the Hereafter
  75,22,"On that Day, some faces shall be bright"
  75,23,looking towards their Lord
  75,24,And on that Day some faces shall be gloomy
  75,25,thinking that some backbreaking calamity is about to be inflicted on them
  75,26,"Nay, when a man’s soul is about to leave and reaches to the throat"
  75,27,"and those around him cry: \"Is there any enchanter to help"
  75,28,Then man will conclude that it was the time of departure from this world
  75,29,while one leg will twist around the other leg (agony will heap on agony)
  75,30,that will be the Day of driving towards your Lord
  75,31,"But in this life he neither believed, nor offered Salah (prayed)"
  75,32,but on the contrary he denied the truth and turned away
  75,33,Then he went to his kinfolk elated with pride
  75,34,"Woe to you, O man! Woe to you"
  75,35,"Again woe to you, O man! Woe to you"
  75,36,Does man think that he will be left without any purpose
  75,37,Was he not once a drop of emitted semen
  75,38,"Then he became a leechlike mass, then Allah created him and fashioned him in due proportion"
  75,39,"and made him either of the two sexes, male and female"
  75,40,Has He not then the power to bring the dead to life
  76,1,Has there not passed over man a period of time when he was nothing- -not even mentioned
  76,2,"Indeed, We have created man from the sperm drop, so that We may test him. Therefore, We gave him the faculties of hearing and sight"
  76,3,"Then We guided him to the Way: either to be grateful or to be a disbeliever"
  76,4,"For the disbelievers, We have prepared chains, fetters and a blazing fire"
  76,5,The righteous shall be in paradise drinking from a cup of wine mixed with Kafoor (camphorwater)
