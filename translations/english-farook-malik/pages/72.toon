quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,166,"What ye suffered on the day the two armies met, was with the leave of Allah, in order that He might test the believers"
  3,167,"And the Hypocrites also. These were told: \"Come, fight in the way of Allah, or (at least) drive (the foe from your city).\" They said: \"Had we known there would be a fight, we should certainly have followed you.\" They were that day nearer to Unbelief than to Faith, saying with their lips what was not in their hearts. But Allah hath full knowledge of all they conceal"
  3,168,"(They are) the ones that say, (of their brethren slain), while they themselves sit (at ease): \"If only they had listened to us they would not have been slain.\" Say: \"Avert death from your own selves, if ye speak the truth"
  3,169,"Think not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord"
  3,170,"They rejoice in the bounty provided by Allah. And with regard to those left behind, who have not yet joined them (in their bliss), the (martyrs) glory in the fact that on them is no fear, nor have they (cause to) grieve"
  3,171,"They glory in the Grace and the bounty from Allah, and in the fact that Allah suffereth not the reward of the Faithful to be lost (in the least)"
  3,172,"Of those who answered the call of Allah and the Messenger, even after being wounded, those who do right and refrain from wrong have a great reward"
  3,173,"Those to whom men said: \"A great army is gathering against you, so fear them!\". But it (only) increased their Faith: They said: \"For us Allah sufficeth, and He is the best Guardian"
