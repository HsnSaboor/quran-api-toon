quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  48,10,"Surely those who swore allegiance to you O Prophet, indeed swore allegiance to Allah Himself. The Hand of Allah was above their hands. Now, the one who will break his pledge, will break it at his own peril, and the one who will keep his pledge that he has made with Allah, shall soon be given a great reward by Him"
  48,11,"The beduin Arabs who stayed behind will soon say to you: \"Our goods and families kept us occupied, so please ask forgiveness for us.\" They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Tell them: \"Who can intervene on your behalf with Allah if it be His will to do you harm or He pleases to do you good? Allah is well aware of your actions"
  48,12,Rather you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families; this fancy seemed pleasing to your hearts. You conceived evil thoughts and thus incurred damnation
  48,13,"He who does not believe in Allah and His Messenger, We have prepared a blazing fire for such unbelievers"
  48,14,"To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth: He forgives whom He pleases and He punishes whom He wills. Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  48,15,"When you set forth to take the spoils of war, those who stayed behind will say: \"Let us come with you.\" They wish to change Allah’s decree. Tell them plainly: \"You shall not come with us. Allah has already said this before.\" Then they will say: \"Nay! But you are jealous of us.\" Whereas there is no question of jealousy, but little do they understand such things"
