  46,15,"We have enjoined upon man to treat his parents with kindness. With much trouble his mother bore him, and with much pain did she give him birth. His bearing and his weaning took thirty months. When he reaches the age of full strength and becomes forty years old, he says: \"My Lord! Grant me the grace that I may thank you for the favors which You have bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may do good deeds that will please You, and grant me good children. Surely I turn to You in repentance and surely I am of those who are Muslims"
  46,16,"Such are the people from whom We shall accept the best of their deeds and overlook their misdeeds. They shall be among the residents of paradise: true is the promise that has been made to them in this life"
  46,17,"But he who rebukes his parents and says: \"Uff (as if to say, do not bother me)!

Be a good believer. Surely the promise of Allah is true.\" But he replies: \"This is nothing but tales of the ancients"
  46,18,Such are the people against whom the verdict of torment has proved true and they will be among the prior people of the jinns and the men that have passed away before them. Indeed they will be the losers

  46,20,"On that Day when the disbelievers will be brought before the fire, they will be told: \"You squandered away your good things in your earthly life and you enjoyed them for a while. Today you shall be recompensed with a punishment of humiliation because you behaved with arrogance for which you had no right during your life on earth and because of the transgressions you committed"
