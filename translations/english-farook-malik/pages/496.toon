quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  44,1,Ha M'im
  44,2,We swear by the Glorious Book
  44,3,that We revealed this Qur’an in a blessed night (Layla-tul Qadr); for We wanted to forewarn mankind
  44,4,In that night every matter is decided wisely
  44,5,by a command from Ourself. Surely We send it (The Qur'an) down
  44,6,"as a blessing from your Lord; it is He Who is All-Hearing, All- Knowing"
  44,7,"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, mark this, if you are true believers"
  44,8,There is no god but Him. He gives life and death. He is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers
  44,9,Yet they play about in doubt
  44,10,Well! Wait for the Day when the sky will pour down visible smoke
  44,11,Enveloping all mankind; this will be a painful punishment
  44,12,"Then the mankind will say: \"Our Lord! Remove from us this punishment, surely we have become real believers"
  44,13,"But how can the acceptance of Our Message at that time be beneficial to them? A Messenger (Muhammad), who makes the things clear, has already come to them"
  44,14,"yet they deny him, saying: \"He is a madman, taught by others"
  44,15,"We shall remove the affliction (famine from which they were suffering) for a while, but you will revert to the same old ways"
  44,16,One day We shall seize you with a mighty onslaught to exact Our retribution
  44,17,"Before them We had put the people of Pharoah (Pharaoh) to the same test, when an honorable Messenger came to them"
  44,18,"saying: \"Hand over to me the servants of Allah. I am to you a Messenger worthy of all trust"
