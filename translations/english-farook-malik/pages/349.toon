quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  23,105,"We shall say to them: \"Were My revelations not recited to you, and did you not deny them"
  23,106,"They will say: \"O our Lord! Our misfortune overwhelmed us and we became erring folk"
  23,107,"Our Lord! Get us out of here; if we ever return to sin, then we shall indeed be wrongdoers"
  23,108,"In answer to this Allah will say: \"Stay here in shame and do not plead with Me"
  23,109,"For you are the same people, who used to make fun of some of My worshippers who prayed: ‘Our Lord, We believe in You; please forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are the Best of those who show mercy!’"
  23,110,"But you ridiculed them so much, that you even forgot My very existence, and went on laughing at them"
  23,111,"Today I have rewarded them for their fortitude, and they are the ones who have achieved bliss"
  23,112,"They will be asked: \"How many years did you live on earth"
  23,113,"They will reply: \"We lived there a day or part of a day; You may ask those who kept the count"
  23,114,"It will be said: \"Well, now you know that your stay was just a little while - what a pity, you did not believe it then"
  23,115,Did you think that We had created you without any purpose and that you would never return to Us for accountability
  23,116,"Therefore, exalted be Allah, the Real King; there is no god but Him, the Lord of the Honorable Throne"
  23,117,Whoever invokes another god besides Allah - about whose divinity he has no proof -he will have to give an account to his Lord. Surely such unbelievers will never attain salvation
  23,118,"Say: \"O Lord, forgive, have Mercy, You are the Best of those who show mercy"
