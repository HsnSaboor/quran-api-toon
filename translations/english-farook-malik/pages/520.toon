quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,"How many generations, far stronger in power, have We destroyed before them! They searched the entire land: but could they find any refuge"
  50,37,"Surely in this there is a lesson for every person who has a heart, and can hear and witness"
  50,38,"We created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them in six periods, and no fatigue touched Us"
  50,39,"Therefore, O Prophet, bear with them in patience whatever they say, and keep on glorifying your Lord before sunrise and before sunset"
  50,40,And glorify Him during a part of the night and after the prostration (prayers)
  50,41,And listen! The Day when the Caller will call out from a place quite near
  50,42,the Day when the people will hear the mighty blast in reality; that will be the Day of coming forth (the dead will rise from their graves)
  50,43,Surely it is We Who give life and death; and to Us shall all return
  50,44,on that Day when the earth shall split asunder and the people shall be rushing out of it; that gathering them together shall be quite easy for Us
  50,45,We know very well what these unbelievers say. You (O Muhammad) are not there to compel them to believe. So admonish with this Qur’an every such person who fears My warning
  51,1,By the dust scattering winds
  51,2,then by the heavy laden clouds
  51,3,then by their swift gliding
  51,4,then by those who distribute the big affair (rain)
  51,5,"surely, that which you are being promised is true"
  51,6,"and surely, the Day of Judgment shall come to pass"
