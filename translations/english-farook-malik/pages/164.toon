quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  7,105,"It is not befitting for me to say anything about Allah except the Truth. I have come to you from your Lord with clear signs of appointment, therefore, send the children of Israel with me"
  7,106,"Pharoah asked: \"If you have come with a sign then produce it, if what you say is true"
  7,107,So Moses threw down his staff and all of a sudden it became a real serpent
  7,108,Then he drew out his hand from his pocket and it became shining white to all the beholders
  7,109,"The chiefs of Pharoah’s nation said: \"He indeed is a skilled sorcerer"
  7,110,"who intends to drive you out from your land.\" Pharoah asked: \"So what do you propose"
  7,111,"They said: \"Put him and his brother off for a while; and send the collectors to all the cities"
  7,112,and summon every skillful sorcerer to you
  7,113,"The sorcerers came to Pharoah and said: \"We must certainly have some suitable reward if we prevail"
  7,114,"Yes, he answered. \"Not only reward but more: you shall certainly become my favored friends"
  7,115,"Then they asked Moses: \"Will you cast, or should we be the first ones to cast"
  7,116,"Moses said: \"You cast.\" So when they cast, they bewitched the eyes of the people and terrified them by a display of a mighty sorcery"
  7,117,We inspired Moses to cast his staff. No sooner did he cast his staff than it became a serpent and began to swallow up the creation of their sorcery
  7,118,Thus the truth prevailed and all that they did collapsed
  7,119,Pharoah and his people were defeated and put to humiliation
  7,120,"and the sorcerers, since they were professionals and knew that it was not sorcery, fell down in prostration"
