quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When the heaven will cleft asunder
  82,2,when the stars will scatter
  82,3,when the oceans will be torn apart
  82,4,and when the graves will be laid open
  82,5,then each soul shall know what it has sent forth and what it left behind
  82,6,O man! What has lured you away from your gracious Lord
  82,7,"Who created you, fashioned you, proportioned you"
  82,8,and molded you in whatever form He pleased
  82,9,Nay! In fact you deny the Day of Judgment
  82,10,You should know that guardian angels have indeed been appointed over you
  82,11,who are noble writers
  82,12,they know all that you do
  82,13,On that Day the righteous will surely be in bliss
  82,14,while the wicked will indeed go to hell
  82,15,they shall enter it on the Day of Judgment
  82,16,and they shall not be able to escape from it
  82,17,What will explain to you what the Day of Judgment is
  82,18,"Again, what will explain to you what the Day of Judgment is"
  82,19,"It will be the Day when no one shall have the power to do anything for another: for, on that Day, Allah shall keep the entire command to Himself"
  83,1,Woe to those who defraud
  83,2,"who when, they take by measure from men, take the full measure"
  83,3,"but when they give by measure or by weight to others, they give less than due"
  83,4,Do they not think that they will be raised to life again
  83,5,on a Mighty Day
  83,6,a Day when all mankind will stand before the Lord of the worlds
