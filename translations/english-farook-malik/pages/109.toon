quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,10,"As for those who reject faith and deny Our revelations, they will be the companions of hellfire"
  5,11,O believers! Also remember Allah’s favor which He recently bestowed upon you when He restrained the hands of those who sought to harm you (Jewish plan to kill the Prophet and eminent companions through an invitation to a dinner which Allah informed him not to attend). Have fear of Allah; and in Allah let the believers put their trust
  5,12,"Allah did in fact make a covenant with the Children of Israel and appointed twelve chieftains from among them and said: \"I am with you; if you establish Salah (prayers) pay Zakah, believe in My Messengers, support them and give a generous loan to Allah (spend in charity), I will certainly forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow. However, if any one of you, after this, violates this covenant, he will indeed go astray from the Right Way"
  5,13,"Even after that, they broke their covenant; as a result, We laid on them Our curse and hardened their hearts. They tampered with words out of their context and neglected much of what they were enjoined. You will always find most of them deceitful except for a few of them. Yet forgive them and overlook their misdeeds. Allah loves those who are kind to others"
