quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  57,19,"Those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, they are the truthful and the true witnesses in the sight of their Lord; they shall have their reward and their light. But those who disbelieve and reject Our revelations; they shall be the inmates of hellfire"
  57,20,"You should know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, a show and boasting among yourselves, a quest for greater riches and more children. Its similitude is that of vegetation that flourish after rain: the growth of which delights the tillers, then it withers and you see it turn yellow, soon it becomes dry and crumbles away. In the hereafter there will be either severe punishment or forgiveness from Allah and His good pleasure. The life of this world is nothing but an illusion"
  57,21,"Therefore, earnestly strive for the forgiveness of your Lord and for the paradise which is as vast as the heaven and the earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers. Such is the grace of Allah, which He bestows on whom He pleases, and Allah is the Owner of mighty grace"
  57,22,"No affliction can happen on earth nor to your souls, which is not recorded in a Book, before We bring it into existence; surely that is easy for Allah"
  57,23,"This is done so that you may not grieve for the things that you miss, or be overjoyed at what you gain; for Allah does not love any vainglorious boaster"
  57,24,"nor those who, being stingy themselves, enjoin others to be stingy also. He that gives no heed should know that Allah is free of all needs, worthy of all praises"
