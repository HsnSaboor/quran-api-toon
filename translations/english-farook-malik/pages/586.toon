quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun will cease to shine
  81,2,when the stars will loose their luster
  81,3,when the mountains will be blown away
  81,4,when the ten-month pregnant she-camels will be left unattended
  81,5,when the wild beasts will be brought together
  81,6,when the oceans will be set ablaze
  81,7,when the souls will be reunited with the bodies
  81,8,when the infant girls buried alive (here reference is made to the Pre-Islamic Arab custom of burying new born girls alive) will be questioned
  81,9,for what sin she was killed
  81,10,when the record will be laid open
  81,11,when the heaven will be stripped bare
  81,12,when hell will be set to blaze
  81,13,and when the paradise will be brought near
  81,14,then each soul shall know what it has bought with it
  81,15,But no! I swear by the retreating stars
  81,16,that run their course and hide
  81,17,by the night as it dissipates
  81,18,by the morning when it breaths again
  81,19,surely this word (The Qur’an) is brought by a noble Messenger (Gabriel)
  81,20,"possessor of mighty power, having very high rank with the Owner of the Throne (Allah)"
  81,21,"who is obeyed in heaven, and is trustworthy"
  81,22,O people of Mecca! Your companion has not gone mad
  81,23,he (Muhammad) indeed saw him (Gabriel) in the clear horizon
  81,24,and he is not stingy to withhold the knowledge of the unseen
  81,25,This (Qur’an) is not the word of an accursed Satan
  81,26,Where then are you going
  81,27,This is but a Message to all the people of the world
  81,28,to each one who wishes to follow the Right Way
  81,29,"Yet your wishes are of no avail unless Allah, the Lord of the worlds, pleases so"
