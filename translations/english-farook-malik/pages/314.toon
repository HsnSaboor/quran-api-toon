quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  20,38,when We revealed Our will to your mother saying
  20,39,Put your child into the chest and throw the chest into the river. The river will cast him on to the bank and he will be picked up by one who is an enemy to Me and an enemy to him.' I made you an object of love and so arranged things that you may be brought up under My supervision
  20,40,"Recall when your sister went to them and said: 'May I tell you of the one who can take care of this child?’ Thus did We return you back to your mother to comfort her eyes and that she might not grieve. Again when you killed a man, We saved you from great distress and We tested you through various trials. You stayed a number of years with the people of Median. Now you have come here per Our pre-ordainment, O Moses"
  20,41,I have molded you for My service
  20,42,You and your brother should go with My Signs and do not neglect to mention Me
  20,43,"Go both of you to Pharoah, for he has indeed transgressed all bounds"
  20,44,Speak to him in gentle words; perhaps he may take heed of the reminder or fear Our punishment
  20,45,"Moses and Haroon said: \"Our Lord! We fear that he may behave towards us unjustly or may cross all bounds"
  20,46,"Allah said: \"Do not be afraid, I shall be with you both. I hear everything and see everything"
  20,47,So go to him and say 'Surely we both are Messengers of your Lord. Let the Children of Israel go with us and oppress them no more. We have brought you a Sign from your Lord; may peace be upon him who follows the guidance
  20,48,Indeed it has been revealed to us that the scourge will fall on those who deny this fact and turn away’
  20,49,"When Moses and Haroon went to Pharoah and delivered this message , he said: \"Well, who is your Lord O Moses"
  20,50,"Moses replied: \"Our Lord is He Who has given a distinctive form to all creatures and then rightly guided them"
  20,51,"Pharoah asked: \"What do you say about the condition of previous generations"
