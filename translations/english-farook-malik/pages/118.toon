quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,58,When you call for Salah (prayers) they make it as an object of mockery and pastime; this is because they are a people devoid of understanding
  5,59,"Tell them: \"O people of the Book! What makes you against us other than that we believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed before? The fact is that most of you are rebellious transgressors"
  5,60,"Ask them: \"Should I tell you of those who will have even worse than this in retribution from Allah? They are those whom Allah has cursed; who have incurred His wrath; some of whom were turned into apes and pigs; who worshipped Taghut (forces of Satan); these are worse in rank and far more astray from the Right Way"
  5,61,"When they come to you they say: \"We believe\". But in fact, unbelievers they came and unbelievers they depart. Allah knows fully well what they hide in their hearts"
  5,62,"You will see many of them try to beat each other in sin and rancor, and they consume what is unlawful. Evil indeed is what they do"
  5,63,Why don’t their Rabbis and the Jurists of laws forbid them from uttering sinful words and eating unlawful things? Evil indeed are their deeds
  5,64,"The Jews say: Allah’s hand is tied up! - Nay! Their own hands will be tied up and they will be cursed for what they utter. Both of His hands are free; However, He spends as He pleases. The fact is that the revelations that have come to you from Allah will surely make many of them increase in their wickedness and unbelief. We have stirred among them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindle the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it. Now they are striving to spread mischief in the land. Allah does not love those who do mischief"
