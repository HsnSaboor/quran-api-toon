quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,About what are they asking
  78,2,About the mighty event
  78,3,the theme of their disputes
  78,4,Very soon they shall come to know
  78,5,"We repeat, very soon they shall come to know"
  78,6,Is it not true that We have spread the earth like a bed
  78,7,and the mountains as pegs
  78,8,created you in pairs
  78,9,provided you rest in sleep
  78,10,made the night a mantle
  78,11,made the day to work for earning your livelihood
  78,12,built above you seven firmaments
  78,13,placed therein a shining lamp
  78,14,sent down abundant water from the clouds
  78,15,"bringing forth grain, vegetation"
  78,16,and gardens of luxurious growth
  78,17,The Day of decision is already fixed
  78,18,"On that Day, the Trumpet shall be sounded and you shall come forth in multitude"
  78,19,The sky shall be opened as if there were doors
  78,20,The mountains shall vanish as if they were a mirage
  78,21,"For sure, the hell shall lie in ambush"
  78,22,to become a home for the transgressors
  78,23,There they shall live for ages
  78,24,in it they shall taste neither refreshment nor drink
  78,25,except scalding water and decaying filth
  78,26,a fitting recompense for their deeds
  78,27,For they never expected to be accountable
  78,28,and wittingly rejected Our revelations
  78,29,But We had recorded everything in a Book
  78,30,"It will be said: \"Taste the fruits of your deeds! You shall have nothing but increase in punishment"
