  22,25,"As for those who are unbelievers and debar others from the Way of Allah and from the Masjid-al-Haram, to which We have assigned all mankind with equal rights whether they are natives or foreigners, and whoever intends to deviate from righteousness to wrongdoing in its vicinity, We will make him taste a painful punishment"
  22,26,"Remember! We identified the site of the Sacred House to Abraham, saying, \"Worship none besides Me, sanctify My House for those worshippers who make Tawaf (walking counterclockwise around it as a part of the Hajj rituals), and stand in prayer, bow, and prostrate themselves"
  22,27,"and make a proclamation of Hajj (Pilgrimage) to mankind: they will come to you on foot and on lean camels from every distant quarter"
  22,28,"so that they may witness the benefits which are made available here for them, and pronounce the name of Allah over the cattle which We have provided as food for them, on the appointed days, then eat meat themselves and feed the indigent and needy"
  22,29,"Then they should accomplish their needful acts of shaving or cutting their hair and taking a bath, fulfill their vows and go for Tawaf-e-Ziyarah to the Ancient House"
  22,30,"This was the object for which the Ka’bah was built, and whoever honors the sacred rites of Allah, it is good for him in the sight of his Lord. The meat of cattle is lawful to you, except what has already been mentioned to you; therefore, shun the abomination of idols and shun all false statements"
