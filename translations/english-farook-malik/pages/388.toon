quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,22,"As he made his way towards Madyan, he said: \"Soon my Lord shall guide me to the Right Way"
  28,23,"When he arrived at the well of Madyan, he saw a multitude of men watering their flocks, and besides them two women who were keeping their flocks back. He asked: \"What is the problem?\" They replied: \"We cannot water our flocks until the shepherds take away their flocks from the water, because we are weak and our father is a very old man"
  28,24,"So he watered their flocks for them and went back to the shade and prayed: \"O Lord! Surely I am in desperate need of whatever good that You may send down to me"
  28,25,"Soon after that, one of the two women came to him walking bashfully and said: \"My father is calling you. He wishes to reward you for watering our flocks for us.\" When Moses came to him and narrated his story, the old man said: \"Have no fear. You have escaped from those wicked people"
  28,26,"One of the daughters said: \"Father, hire this man. The best that one can hire is a man who is strong and trustworthy"
  28,27,"The old man said to Moses: \"I am willing to give you one of my daughters in marriage if you stay in my service for eight years; but you may complete ten if you wish. I do not want to put you in trouble; Allah willing, you will find me one of the righteous"
  28,28,"Moses replied: \"So be it an agreement between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I complete, let there be no compulsion on me. Allah is the witness to what we have agreed upon"
