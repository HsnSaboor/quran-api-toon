quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,31,"Dedicate yourselves to Allah and do not commit shirk with Him: for anyone who commits shirk, it is as though he had fallen from the sky; then his body is either snatched away by birds or carried away by the wind to some far-off place"
  22,32,"so it is, and he who respects the Symbols of Allah, surely shows the piety of his heart"
  22,33,"You may benefit (by using their milk) from the cattle dedicated for sacrifice, until the time of their slaughter, then their place of sacrifice is near the Ancient House"
  22,34,"For every nation We prescribed a way of sacrifice so that they may pronounce the name of Allah over the cattle which He has given them for food, your God is one God; so submit yourselves to Him as a Muslim, and give good news to the humble"
  22,35,"whose hearts tremble at the mention of Allah; who endure adversity with patience, who establish Salah and spend in charity out of what we have given them"
  22,36,"We have included the sacrificial camels among the Symbols of Allah, for there is much good for you in them. Therefore, pronounce the name of Allah over them while standing, and when they fall down on their sides after slaughter, then eat of their meat, feed the contented (poor who do not ask) and the beggars (poor who ask). Thus We have subjected these animals to you so that you may be grateful"
  22,37,"It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah; it is your piety that reaches Him. Thus, He has subjected these animals to you so that you may glorify Allah for giving you guidance, and O Prophet, give good news to those who do good to others"
  22,38,"Surely Allah wards off evil from those who are true believers: for certainly Allah does not love anyone who is treacherous, ungrateful"
