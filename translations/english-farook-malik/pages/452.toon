quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you? How do you judge
  37,155,Will you not take heed
  37,156,Or do you have any proof of what you are saying
  37,157,Show us your scriptures if you are truthful
  37,158,They assert blood- relationship between Him and the jinns; and the jinns know quite well that they will be called to account
  37,159,Glory be to Allah! He is free from what they ascribe to Him
  37,160,except His sincere devotees who do not attribute such things to Him
  37,161,Therefore neither you nor those whom you worship
  37,162,can deceive anyone about Allah
  37,163,except him who is destined for hell
  37,164,"The angels in fact say: \"We each have our appointed place"
  37,165,We range ourselves in ranks for His service
  37,166,and we are surely those who declare His glory
  37,167,"Before this, the same disbelievers used to say"
  37,168,If we had received a reminder which the earlier people had received
  37,169,We certainly would have been sincere devotees of Allah
  37,170,"But now that the Qur’an has come, they reject it: but soon they will find out the consequences of this attitude"
  37,171,We have already promised Our servants whom We sent as Messengers
  37,172,that they would certainly be helped
  37,173,and that Our forces will surely be victorious
  37,174,So give no heed to them for a while
  37,175,you will see their downfall as they shall see your victory
  37,176,Do they wish to hurry on Our punishment
  37,177,"But dreadful will be that morning, when it will descend in the courtyards of those who have been forewarned"
  37,178,So pay no heed to them for a while
  37,179,You will surely see their downfall as they shall see your victory
  37,180,"Glory be to your Lord, the Lord of Honor, He is free from what they ascribe to Him"
  37,181,Peace be on the Messengers
  37,182,"and praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds"
