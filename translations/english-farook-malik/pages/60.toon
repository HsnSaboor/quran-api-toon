quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,78,"There are some among them who twist their tongues pretending a quote from their Holy Book; so that you may think that what they read is a part of the Book, whereas, in fact it is not a part of the Book. They also assert, \"It is from Allah\" whereas, in fact it is not from Allah. Thus they deliberately ascribe a lie to Allah"
  3,79,"It is not possible for a man whom Allah has given the Book, the Wisdom and the Prophethood, that he would say to the people: \"Worship me instead of Allah.\" On the contrary he would say: \"Be devoted worshippers of your Lord in accordance with the Holy Book you have been teaching and reading"
  3,80,He would never ask you to take angels and prophets as your lords. Would he ask you to become kafir (unbeliever) after you have become Muslim (believer)
  3,81,"Allah took a covenant with the Prophets, saying: \"Now that you have been given the Book and Wisdom; there will come to you a Messenger who will confirm that which is with you, you will have to believe in him and help him in his mission.\" Then He said \"Do you affirm this covenant and agree to take this heavy responsibility?\" The Prophets replied, \"Yes, we do affirm.\" Allah said, \"Very well, bear witness to this and I too bear witness with you"
  3,82,"Now if anyone turns back after this, he will become the transgressor"
  3,83,"Are they looking for a religion other than the Deen (religion and Way of Life) of Allah knowing well that everything in the heavens and in the earth, willingly or unwillingly, has submitted to Him? And to Him they shall all return"
