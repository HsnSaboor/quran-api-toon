quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,23,"Have you not seen the behavior of those (Jews) who have been given a portion of the Book? When they are invited to settle their disputes according to the Book of Allah, some of them turn back and decline"
  3,24,"This is because they say: \"The fire of Hell shall not touch us; even if it does, it will be for a few days.\" In their religion they are deceived by their own self-invented beliefs"
  3,25,"What will they do when We will gather them together on the Day which is sure to come, when every soul will be given what it has earned and there shall be no injustice"
  3,26,"Say: \"O Allah! Master of all the Kingship, You give the kingdom to whom You please and take away the kingdom from whomsoever You please; You give honor to whom You please and disgrace whom You please; all the good is in Your hand; surely You have power over everything"
  3,27,You cause the night to pass into the day and You cause the day to pass into the night; You draw the living from the dead and You draw the dead from the living; and You provide sustenance for anyone You wish without measure
  3,28,"Let not the believers make unbelievers their protectors rather than the believers; anyone who does so will have nothing to hope for from Allah - except if you do so as a precaution to guard yourselves against their tyranny. Anyhow, Allah warns you to fear Him: because with Allah is your final refuge"
  3,29,"Say: \"Whether you conceal what is in your heart or reveal it, it is known to Allah"
