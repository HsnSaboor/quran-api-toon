  25,56,But O Muhammad! We have sent you only to proclaim good news and to give warning
  25,57,"Say: \"I ask of you no recompense for this work except that he who wants, may take the Right Way to his Lord"
  25,58,"Put your trust in the Ever-Living (Allah) Who never dies: celebrate His praise, for He Alone is sufficient to be aware of the sins of His servants"
  25,59,"The One Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days, and is firmly established on the Throne of authority; the Compassionate (Allah): as to His Glory, ask the one who knows"
  25,60,"When it is said to them, \"Prostrate yourselves before the Most Compassionate,\" they ask: \"Who is that Most Compassionate? Are we to prostrate just because you order us to?\" It merely increases their disdain"
  25,61,Blessed is the One Who has decked the sky with constellations and placed in it a lamp and a shining moon
  25,62,"He is the One Who has caused the night and the day to succeed each other, for him who desires to learn a lesson or desires to render thanks"
  25,63,"True servants of the Compassionate (Allah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and when the ignorant people address them, they say: \"Peace"
  25,64,who pass the night prostrating before their Lord and standing in prayers
  25,65,"who say: \"Our Lord! Ward off the punishment of hell from us, for its punishment is atrocious"
  25,66,certainly it is an evil abode and an evil resting place
  25,67,"who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor stingy, but keep the balance between those two extremes"
