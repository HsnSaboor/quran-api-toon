quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  42,45,"You will see them brought before awed and humiliated, looking at it with stealthy glances.

Surely the wrongdoers shall suffer everlasting punishment"
  42,46,They shall have no protectors who could help them besides Allah. The one whom Allah lets go astray has no way of escape
  42,47,"Answer the call of your Lord before that Day arrives which cannot be averted against the will of Allah. There shall be no refuge for you on that Day, nor shall you be able to deny your sins"

  42,49,To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates whatever He pleases. He gives daughters to whom He pleases and gives sons to whom He pleases
  42,50,"To some He gives both sons and daughters, and makes barren whom He will; surely He is All-knowledgeable, All-Powerful"
  42,51,"It is not vouchsafed to any human being that Allah should speak to him face to face, He speaks either through inspiration, or from behind a veil, or through sending a messenger (angel Gabriel) authorized by Him to reveal His will; surely He is most High, most Wise"
