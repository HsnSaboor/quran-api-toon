quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  56,51,"Then, \"O the mistaken rejecters"
  56,52,you shall eat of the Zaqqum tree
  56,53,and fill your bellies with it
  56,54,and drink on top of it scalding water
  56,55,yet you shall drink it like a thirsty camel
  56,56,Such will be their entertainment on the Day of Reckoning
  56,57,"We have created you: will you not then testify about Our power of creation"
  56,58,Have you ever considered the semen you discharge
  56,59,"Is it you who create the child from it, or are We the Creator"
  56,60,It is We Who have ordained death among you and We are not helpless
  56,61,in replacing you by others like yourselves or transforming you into beings that you do not know
  56,62,"You already know well your first creation, why then do you not take heed"
  56,63,Have you ever considered the seed that you sow in the ground
  56,64,Is it you who cause it to grow or are We the grower
  56,65,"If it be Our Will, We could crumble your harvest into chaff, and you would then be left in lamenting"
  56,66,We are indeed left laden with debts
  56,67,indeed we have been deprived from the fruits of our labor
  56,68,Have you ever considered the water which you drink
  56,69,Is it you who send it down from the clouds or are We the sender
  56,70,"If it be Our Will, We could turn it salty. Why then do you not give thanks"
  56,71,Have you ever considered the fire that you kindle
  56,72,Is it you who grow the tree which feeds the fire or are We the grower
  56,73,"We have made it a reminder for man as to what would be the life without it, and a provision of life for the travellers of desert"
  56,74,"So glorify the name of your Lord, Who is the Greatest"
  56,75,I swear by the setting of the stars
  56,76,and it is indeed a mighty oath if you but knew it
