quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He (the Prophet) frowned and turned away
  80,2,"when there came to him the blind man (Ibn Umme Maktum, who came to the Prophet and interrupted his conversation with the chiefs of Mecca)"
  80,3,How could you tell? He might have sought to purify himself
  80,4,or become reminded and might have benefited from Our reminder
  80,5,As for him who is indifferent
  80,6,to whom you were attending
  80,7,you will not be held responsible if he would not purify himself
  80,8,Yet to him who came to you with zeal on his own
  80,9,and with fear of Allah in his heart
  80,10,you gave no heed
  80,11,"It should not be so! Indeed, this is but an admonition"
  80,12,"let him who wants, accept it"
  80,13,"It is written in scrolls, which are honored"
  80,14,"exalted, purified"
  80,15,and which remain in the hands of scribes
  80,16,who are noble and virtuous
  80,17,Woe to man! What a disbeliever he is
  80,18,Out of what Allah has created him
  80,19,Out of a semen-drop! Allah created him and then fashioned him in due proportion
  80,20,then makes his way of life smooth for him
  80,21,then causes him to die and stows him in a grave
  80,22,Then He will surely bring him back to life when He pleases
  80,23,By no means has he fulfilled the duty that Allah had assigned him
  80,24,Let man reflect on the food he eats
  80,25,How We pour down rainwater in abundance
  80,26,and cleave the soil asunder
  80,27,How We bring forth grain
  80,28,grapes and nutritious vegetation
  80,29,olives and dates
  80,30,lush gardens
  80,31,fruits and fodder
  80,32,as a means of sustenance for you and your cattle
  80,33,Finally when there come the deafening blast
  80,34,on that Day each man shall flee from his own brother
  80,35,his mother and his father
  80,36,his wife and his children
  80,37,"For each one of them, on that Day, shall have enough concern of his own to make him indifferent to the others"
  80,38,Some faces on that Day shall be shining
  80,39,smiling and joyful
  80,40,And some faces on that Day shall be dusty
  80,41,and veiled with darkness
  80,42,These shall be the faces of the disbelieving wicked
