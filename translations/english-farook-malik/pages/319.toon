quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  20,99,"Thus do We relate to you, O Muhammad, some information of the past events; and indeed We have sent you this Reminder (The Qur’an) from Our Own Self"
  20,100,"Those who reject it, shall bear a heavy burden on the Day of Resurrection"
  20,101,"For ever shall they bear it, and it will be indeed a very evil burden to bear on the Day of Resurrection"
  20,102,"The Day, when the Trumpet will be blown and We shall assemble all the sinners, their eyes will turn blue with terror"
  20,103,"They shall murmur among themselves: \"You hardly lived ten days on earth"
  20,104,"We know fully well what they will say; the most careful estimator among them will say: \"No, you stayed no longer than a day"
  20,105,"They ask you as to what will happen to the mountains. Tell them: \"My Lord will crush and scatter them like a fine dust"
  20,106,He will turn the earth into a plain leveled ground
  20,107,wherein you will not see neither any curve nor crease
  20,108,"On that Day the people will follow the call of the Caller, no one will dare show any crookedness; their voices hushed before the Beneficent (Allah), and you shall hear nothing but the sound of the marching feet"
  20,109,"On that Day, no intercession will avail except the one to whom the Beneficent (Allah) shall grant permission and would like to give him a hearing"
  20,110,He knows what is before them and what is behind them while they do not encompass any knowledge about Him
  20,111,"Their faces shall be humbled before the Ever-Living, the Ever-existent (Allah). The one who is carrying the burden of iniquity will be doomed"
  20,112,but the one who is a believer and does good deeds shall fear no tyranny or injustice
  20,113,Thus have we sent down this Qur’an in Arabic and clearly proclaimed in it some of the warnings so that they may take heed or that it may serve as a reminder to them
