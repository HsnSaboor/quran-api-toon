quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  13,19,"How can the one who knows that which has been revealed to you from your Rabb is the Truth, be like the one who is blind to this fact? Only those who use their common sense benefit from this reminder"
  13,20,They are the ones who fulfill their covenant with Allah and do not break their pledge
  13,21,"and they are the ones who join together what Allah has commanded to be joined, who fear their Rabb and are afraid of a terrible reckoning"
  13,22,"also thery are the ones who are patient, seek the pleasure of their Rabb, establish Salah, spend secretly and openly out of the sustenance which We have provided for them, and repel evil with good - they are the ones for whom there is the home of the hereafter"
  13,23,"the Paradise of perpetual bliss: they will enter into it along with their righteous forefathers, their spouses and their descendants. The angels will come to welcome them from every side"
  13,24,"saying: \"Peace be upon you for all that you steadfastly endured in the world. Now! How excellent will be the home of the hereafter"
  13,25,"As for those who break their covenant with Allah after confirming it and cut asunder what Allah has commanded to be joined and create mischief in the land, they are the ones on whom there shall be a curse and they are the ones who will have a terrible home"
  13,26,Allah grants abundantly His provisions to whom He will and sparingly to whom He pleases. The unbelievers rejoice in the life of this world; but brief indeed is the comfort of this worldly life as compared to the life of the hereafter
  13,27,"The unbelievers say: “Why has no sign been sent down to him (Muhammad) from his Rabb?” Say: “In fact Allah lets him go astray who wants, and guides to Himself those who turn to Him"
  13,28,such are the ones who have believed and whose hearts find satisfaction in the remembrance of Allah. Beware! It is the remembrance of Allah which provides tranquility to the hearts
