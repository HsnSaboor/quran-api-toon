quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  76,26,prostrate before Him at night and glorify Him during the long hours of night
  76,27,These unbelievers love the transitory life of this world and neglect the heavy Day that is coming ahead
  76,28,It is We Who created them and made their joints strong; but if We please We can replace them with others like them through a change
  76,29,"This is indeed an admonition, so let him who will, adopt The Way to his Lord"
  76,30,"but you cannot will, except by the will of Allah. Surely Allah is All-Knowledgeable, All-Wise"
  76,31,"He admits to His mercy whom He wills, and for the wrongdoers He has prepared a painful punishment"
  77,1,"By the emissary winds, which are sent forth one after another"
  77,2,By the raging hurricanes
  77,3,By the winds that lift up and scatter the clouds to their distant places
  77,4,then separate them one from another
  77,5,By those who bring down the reminder
  77,6,either to remove the excuse or to convey the warning
  77,7,"Surely, that which you are being promised, shall be fulfilled"
  77,8,It is going to be fulfilled when the stars will lose their light
  77,9,heaven will cleft asunder
  77,10,the mountains will crumble into dust
  77,11,and when the Messengers will be brought together at the appointed time
  77,12,For what Day has all this been deferred
  77,13,For the Day of Judgment
  77,14,"And what will explain to you, what the Day of Judgment is"
  77,15,Woe on that Day to the disbelievers
  77,16,Did We not destroy the former generations for their evil deeds
  77,17,And We shall do the same to later generations who will follow them
  77,18,Thus do We deal with the guilty
  77,19,Woe on that Day to the disbelievers
