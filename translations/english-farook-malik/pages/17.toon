quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,106,We do not abrogate any of Our verses of the Qur'an or cause it to be forgotten except that We substitute it with something better or similar; don't you know that Allah has full power over everything
  2,107,"Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and that besides Allah, you have no protector or helper"
  2,108,"Do you intend to ask questions from your Messenger (Muhammad) as Moses was questioned before? But whoever barters belief for unbelief, has indeed lost the direction of the Right Way"
  2,109,"Many among the people of the Book (Jews and Christians) wish they could somehow turn you back to unbelief, due to their selfish envy, after the truth has become quite clear to them. Forgive them and bear with them until Allah brings about His decision; rest assured that Allah has power over everything"
  2,110,"Establish Salah and pay Zakah, and whatever good you send ahead of you to the Hereafter for yourselves, you shall find it with Allah; surely Allah is watching all your actions"
  2,111,"They say: \"None shall enter paradise except the one who is a Jew or a Christian.\" These are their vain desires. Say O Muhammad: \"Let us have your proof if you are right in your claim"
  2,112,Yea! Whoever submits himself entirely to Allah and is good to others will be rewarded by his Lord; and will have nothing to fear or to regret
