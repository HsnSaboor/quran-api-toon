quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,Another sign for them is how We carried their race through the flood in the laden ark
  36,42,and similar vessels We have made for them on which they ride
  36,43,"If We want, We can drown them, and they will have no helper to save them, nor can they be rescued"
  36,44,except through Our mercy and unless We prolong their lives for a while
  36,45,"When it is said to them: \"Have fear of that which is before you and that which is behind you, so that you may receive mercy,\" they pay no heed"
  36,46,"Whenever any sign from the revelations of their Lord comes to them, they turn away from it"
  36,47,"Whenever they are asked: \"Spend out of what Allah has given you.\" The disbelievers say to the believers: \"Should we feed those whom Allah can feed Himself if He so chooses? You are quite obviously in error"
  36,48,"Further, they say: \"When will this promise of resurrection come to pass, if what you say is true"
  36,49,"In fact what they are waiting for is a single blast, which will seize them while they are yet disputing among themselves in their worldly affairs"
  36,50,"Then, neither they will be able to make a will, nor be able to return to their families"
  36,51,"Then a trumpet shall be blown and, behold, they will rise up from their graves and hasten to their Lord"
  36,52,"They will say: \"Oh, Woe to us! Who has raised us up from our graves? They will be told: \"This is what the Compassionate (Allah) had promised and true was the word of the Messengers"
  36,53,"It will be no more than a single blast, and then they will all be gathered before Us"
  36,54,On that Day no soul will suffer the least injustice and you shall be rewarded according to your deeds
