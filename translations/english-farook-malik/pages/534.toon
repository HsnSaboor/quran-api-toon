quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  55,68,"Each planted with fruit trees, dates and pomegranates"
  55,69,"Then, O jinn and men, which of your Lord’s favors will both of you deny"
  55,70,"In each of them, there will be chaste and beautiful virgins"
  55,71,"Then, O jinn and men, which of your Lord’s favors will both of you deny"
  55,72,Huris (beautiful damsels) sheltered in their tents
  55,73,"Then, O jinn and men, which of your Lord’s favors will both of you deny"
  55,74,Whom neither man nor Jinn has ever touched before
  55,75,"Then, O jinn and men, which of your Lord’s favors will both of you deny"
  55,76,Reclining on green cushions and beautiful fine carpets
  55,77,"Then, O jinn and men, which of your Lord’s favors will both of you deny"
  55,78,"Blessed be the name of your Lord, His Majesty and His Honor"
  56,1,When the inevitable event will come to pass
  56,2,no one will be able to deny its coming to pass
  56,3,then some shall be abased and some exalted
  56,4,The earth shall be shaken with severe shaking
  56,5,and the mountains shall be made to crumble with awful crumbling
  56,6,and become like scattered dust
  56,7,Then you shall be divided into three groups
  56,8,those on the right hand - how blessed shall be the people of the right hand
  56,9,those on the left hand - how damned shall be the people of the left hand
  56,10,and foremost shall be the foremost
  56,11,They will be nearest to Allah
  56,12,in the gardens of bliss
  56,13,Most of them will be from the former
  56,14,and a few from the later generations
  56,15,They shall have the jewelled couches
  56,16,reclining on them facing each other
