quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  62,1,"AL-JUMU’AH - FRIDAY In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the merciful All that is in the heavens and earth declares the glory of Allah, the King, the Holy, the Mighty, the Wise"
  62,2,"It is He Who has raised among the unlettered people a Messenger of their own, who recites to them His revelations, purifies them, and teaches them the Book and Wisdom, though prior to this they were in gross error"
  62,3,"he is also sent for others of them who have not yet joined them (become Muslims). He is the Mighty, the Wise"
  62,4,"That is the grace of Allah, which He bestows on whom pleases. Allah is the Lord of mighty grace"
  62,5,"The example of those who were charged with the Torah, but failed to carry out their obligations, is that of a donkey who is carrying books and does not know what is in those books. Bad is the example of those who deny the revelations of Allah. Allah does not guide the wrongdoers"
  62,6,"O you, the Jews! If you claim that you are the favorites of Allah to the exclusion of other people, then wish for death if what you say is true"
  62,7,"But, because of what their hands have sent before them for the hereafter, they will never wish for death. Allah knows these wrongdoers very well"
  62,8,"Tell them: \"The death from which you are running away, will surely overtake you: then you will be sent back to Him Who knows the unseen and the seen; and He will tell you all that you have been doing"
