quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  39,32,Who could be more wicked than the one who invents a lie against Allah and rejects the truth when it comes to him? Is there not an abode in hell for such unbelievers
  39,33,And the one who comes with the truth and the one who confirms it surely are the Godfearing
  39,34,They shall have from their Lord all that they wish for. Thus shall the righteous be rewarded
  39,35,Allah will do away from their account their worst deeds and reward them according to their best deeds
  39,36,"Is Allah not all- sufficient for His servants? Yet they try to frighten you with others besides Him! For such whom Allah confounds, there can be no guide"
  39,37,"But the one to whom Allah guides, none can lead him astray. Is not Allah All-Mighty, the Lord of retribution"
  39,38,"If you ask them: \"Who created the heavens and the earth?\" They will surely say: \"Allah.\" Ask them: \"Do you think then, that if Allah intends to harm me, can they (your goddesses) - to whom you invoke besides Allah - save me from His harm or if He wants to bestow on me His blessings, can they withhold His blessings?\" Tell them: \"Allah is all-sufficient for me. On Him do the reliant rely"
  39,39,"Say: \"O my people! If you do not believe me, then do whatever you want in your positions and so shall I. Soon you will find out"
  39,40,as to whom shall come the disgraceful scourge and who shall get the everlasting punishment
