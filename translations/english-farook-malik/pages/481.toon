quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,39,"And among His other signs is the earth that you see barren; but when We send down rain upon it, it stirs to life and its yield increases. Surely He Who gives it life, will raise the dead to life. Surely He has power over all things"
  41,40,Those who pervert Our revelations are not hidden from Us. Just consider who is better? The one who is cast into the fire or the one who emerges safe on the Day of Resurrection? Do as you like; surely He is watching all your actions
  41,41,Those who reject this reminder when it comes to them should know that in fact it is a mighty Book
  41,42,No falsehood can approach it from before or from behind. It is a revelation from the One Who is Wise and Praiseworthy
  41,43,"Nothing is said to you (O Muhammad) that was not said to the Messengers before you: that surely your Lord is the Lord of forgiveness, and at the same time the Lord of painful retribution"
  41,44,"Had We revealed this Qur’an in a foreign language, they (same people) would have said: \"Why have not its verses been made clear? Why in a foreign language, while the audience are Arabs?\" Say O Prophet: \"To the believers, it is a guide and a healing; and the ones who do not believe, it is merely their deafness and their blindness; because they act as if they are being called from a far-off place"
  41,45,"Before this Qur’an, We had given the Book to Moses and it was similarly disputed. If your Lord had not already given a word, the Judgment would have been passed between the disputants; grave though their suspicions were about it"
  41,46,"He who does good deeds, does it for his own soul; and he who commits evil does so at his own peril: Your Lord is never unjust to His servants"
