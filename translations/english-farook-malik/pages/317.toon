  20,77,"We sent Our revelation to Moses, saying: \"Set forth with my servants at night and strike a dry path for them through the sea without fear of being overtaken by Pharoah and without any fear while passing through the sea"
  20,78,Pharoah followed them with his armies but the waters completely overwhelmed them and covered them up
  20,79,Thus Pharoah misled his people instead of guiding them aright
  20,80,"O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, We fixed a time to grant you The Torah on the right side of Mount Tur and We sent down to you Manna (sweet dish) and Salva (quail meat)"
  20,81,"saying: \"Eat of the good things We have provided for your sustenance and do not transgress, lest you should incur My wrath, and whoever incurs My wrath, is surely bound to perish"
  20,82,"but the one who repents, becomes a believer, does good deeds and follows the Right Way shall be forgiven"
  20,83,"When Moses came to mount Tur, Allah said: \"But, why have you come with such a haste ahead of your people, O Moses"
  20,84,"He replied: \"They are close behind me, I hastened to You O Lord so that You may be pleased"
  20,85,"Allah said: \"Well, listen! We tested your people after you and the Samiri (Samaritan) has led them astray"
  20,86,"So Moses returned to his people in a state of anger and sorrow. He said: \"O my people! Did your Lord not make a gracious promise to you? Did my absence seem too long to you? Or was it to incur the wrath of your Lord that you broke your promise with me"
  20,87,"They replied: \"We broke the promise through no fault of ours. We were made to carry the burden of the peoples' ornaments and throw them into the fire, thus Samiri suggested, who threw in something"
