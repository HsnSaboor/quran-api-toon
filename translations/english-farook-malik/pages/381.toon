quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  27,45,"To the people of Thamud, We sent their brother Saleh, saying: \"Worship Allah,\" but they divided themselves into two discordant factions"
  27,46,"Saleh said: \"O my people! Why do you wish to hasten towards evil rather than good? Why do you not ask forgiveness of Allah so that you may be shown mercy"
  27,47,"They said: \"We consider you and your companions a sign of bad luck.\" He said: \"Your luck is with Allah; in fact, you are a people under trial"
  27,48,There were nine ringleaders in the city who created mischief in the land and reformed nothing
  27,49,"They said to one another: \"Let us pledge on oath by Allah that we shall make a secret night attack on him and his family, then we shall tell his guardian that we were not even present at the time his family was killed, and that we are telling the truth"
  27,50,"Thus they plotted a plan, and We too plotted a plan which they did not perceive"
  27,51,"Just see what was the outcome of their plot! We annihilated them completely, together with all their people"
  27,52,There lies their houses in desolate ruins as a result of their wrongdoings. Verily in this story there is a lesson for those people who use their common sense
  27,53,Yet We delivered the true believers who were righteous
  27,54,"Also mention to them of Lot, when he said to his people: \"Do you commit indecency though you see its iniquity"
  27,55,Do you approach men for your sexual desires instead of women? The fact is that you are a people steeped in ignorance
