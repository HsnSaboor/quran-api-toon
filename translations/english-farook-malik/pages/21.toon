quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,135,"Jews and Christians say: \"Be Jews or Christians, you shall then be rightly guided.\" O Muhammad, say: \"By no means! We follow the faith of Abraham, the upright one; and he was not one of the pagans"
  2,136,"Say: \"We believe in Allah and that which is revealed to us; and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and their descendants, and that which was given to Moses, Jesus and other Prophets from their Lord. We do not discriminate any of them, and to Allah we have surrendered ourselves (in Islam)"
  2,137,"So, if they accept Islam like you, they shall be rightly guided; if they reject it, they will surely fall into dissension (divide into differing factions); Allah will be your sufficient defender against them, and He hears and knows everything"
  2,138,Baptism is from Allah; and who is better than Allah in baptizing? Him do we worship
  2,139,"Say, O Muhammad: \"Would you dispute with us concerning Allah, who is our Lord and your Lord as well? We shall be accountable to Him for our deeds and you for yours; to Him Alone we are devoted"
  2,140,"Do you claim that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and their descendants were all Jews or Christians? Are you more knowledgeable than Allah?\" Who is more wicked than the one who hides the testimony received from Allah? Allah is not unaware of what you do"
  2,141,"That was a nation who has already passed away. They are responsible for what they did and you are for what you do, you shall not be questioned about their deeds"
