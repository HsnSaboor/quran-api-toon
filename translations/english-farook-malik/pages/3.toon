quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  2,6,"In fact, as for those who reject Faith; it is the same, whether you warn them or you don't, they will not believe"
  2,7,"Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing, their eyes are covered, and there is a grievous punishment for them"
  2,8,"There are some people who say: \"We believe in Allah and the Last Day\" yet they are not true believers"
  2,9,"They try to deceive Allah and the believers. However, they deceive none except themselves yet they do not realize it"
  2,10,"There is a disease of deception in their heart; and Allah lets their disease increase, and they shall have painful punishment for the lies they have told"
  2,11,"When it is said to them: \"Do not make mischief on earth,\" they say: \"We make peace"
  2,12,Beware! They are the ones who make mischief but they do not realize it
  2,13,"When they are told: \"Believe as the others believe\" they ask: \"Should we believe like fools?\" Be aware! They themselves are the fools, if only they could understand"
  2,14,"When they meet the believers they say: \"We are believers,\" but when they are alone with their Satans, they say: \"We are really with you, we were only mocking the believers"
  2,15,Allah will throw back their mockery on them and leave them alone in their trespasses; so they wander to and fro like the blind
  2,16,"These are the people who barter guidance for error: but their bargain is profitless and they are not going to be guided"
