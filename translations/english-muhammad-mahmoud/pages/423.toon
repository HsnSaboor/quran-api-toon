quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,"And in no way should a male believer or a female believer, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a Command, have the choice in their Command. Whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, then he has readily erred away into evident error"
  33,37,"And as you (This is addressed to the prophet) have said to him on whom Allah has (graciously) favored and you have (much) favored, \"Retain your spouse to yourself, and be pious to Allah, \" and you were concealing within yourself what Allah would display, and being apprehensive of mankind; and Allah truly has better right for you to be apprehensive of Him. So, as soon as Zayd had accomplished what he would of her, (i.e., accomplished his purpose, and divorced her. The reference is to Zaynab) We espoused her to you so that there should not be any restriction for the believers concerning the spouses of their adopted sons, when they have accomplished what they would of them; and the Command of Allah has been performed"
  33,38,In no way is there any restriction on the Prophet concerning what Allah has ordained for him. (This is) the Enactment of Allah with the ones who passed away earlier- and the Command of Allah has (always) been a perfectly determined determination
  33,39,Who constantly proclaim the Messages of Allah and are apprehensive of Him and are not apprehensive of any one except Allah; and Allah suffices as Ever-Reckoner
  33,40,"In no way is Muhammad the father of any of your men, but (he is) the Messenger of Allah, and the Seal (Or: Terminator; Last) of the Prophets; and Allah has been Ever-Knowing of everything"
  33,41,"O you who have believed, remember Allah with much remembrance"
  33,42,And extol Him before sunrise and before sunset
  33,43,"He is (The One) Who (responds) to your prayers, and His Angels (respond) (By Allah's command) to bring you out of the darkness (es) into the light; and He has been Ever-Merciful to the believers"
