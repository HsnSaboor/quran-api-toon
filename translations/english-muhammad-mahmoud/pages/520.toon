quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,"And how many a generation We caused to perish before them (who) were more valiant in assault than they, so that they overran the lands; (yet) had they any evasion (from Us)"
  50,37,"Surely in that there is indeed a Reminding to him who has a heart, or is eager (Literally: cast \"his\" hearing) on hearing, and is a constantly present witness (to the Truth)"
  50,38,"And indeed We already created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days, and in no way has any fatigue touched Us"
  50,39,So (endure) patiently what they say and extol with the praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting
  50,40,"And in the night then extol (Him) and at the ends (Literally: at the rear) of prostrations"
  50,41,And listen for the Day when the Caller will call out from a near place
  50,42,The Day (when) they hear the Shout with the Truth; that is the Day of going out (of the graves)
  50,43,"Surely We, Ever We, give life and make to die, and to Us is the Destiny"
  50,44,The Day (when) the earth is cloven from above them as they (go forth) swiftly; that is a mustering easy for Us
  50,45,We know best whatever they say; and in no way are you a potentate over them. So remind by the Qur'an him who fears (My) threat
  51,1,And (by) the winnowers with (swift) winnowing
  51,2,"Then (by) the bearers of heavy burdens, (Or: obstruction)"
  51,3,Then (by) the runners with ease
  51,4,Then (by) the dividers by the Command
  51,5,Surely what you are promised is indeed sincere
  51,6,And surely the Doom is indeed befalling
