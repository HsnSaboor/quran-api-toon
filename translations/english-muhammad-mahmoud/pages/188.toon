quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,7,"How should the associators (Those who associate others with Allah) have a covenant in the Meeting with Allah and in the sight of His Messenger? Excepting the ones (with) whom you covenanted at the Inviolable Mosque; so, as long as they go straight with you, so go straight with them; surely Allah loves the pious"
  9,8,"How? (i.e., How can they keep their covenant?) And in case they get the better of you, they will respect towards you neither consanguinity nor treaty; they satisfy you with their mouths, (but) their hearts refuse; and most of them are immoral"
  9,9,"They have traded the signs of Allah for a little price, so they have barred from His way; surely odious is whatever they were doing"
  9,10,"They respect (Literally: watch) neither consanguinity nor treaty towards a believer; and those are the ones (who are) transgressors"
  9,11,"So, in case they repent, and keep up the prayer, and bring the Zakat, (Pay the obligatory poor-dues.) then they are your brethren in the religion; and We expound the signs for a people who know"
  9,12,"And in case they breach their oaths after their covenant, and discredit your religion, then fight the leaders of disbelief; surely they have no (binding) oaths, that possibly they would refrain"
  9,13,"Will you not fight a people who breached their oaths and designed to drive out the Messenger, and it was they who began the first time against you? Are you apprehensive of them? Then Allah truly has more right (on you) to be apprehensive of Him in case you are believers"
