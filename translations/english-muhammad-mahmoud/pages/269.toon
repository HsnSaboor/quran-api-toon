quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  16,15,"And He has cast in the earth anchorages (i.e., mountains) so that it should not reel with you, and rivers and ways that possibly you would be guided"
  16,16,And way marks; and by the star they are guided
  16,17,"So, is He Who creates as he who does not create? Will you then not be mindful"
  16,18,"And in case you number the favor (s) of Allah, you will not enumerate them; surely Allah is indeed Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
  16,19,And Allah knows whatever you keep secret and whatever you make public
  16,20,And the ones they invoke apart from Allah do not create a thing and themselves are created
  16,21,"Dead, not alive, (i.e. other than being alive) and in no way are they aware whence they will be made to rise again"
  16,22,"Your God is One God. So, the ones who do not believe in the Hereafter, their hearts (are) denying and they are waxing proud"
  16,23,(There is) no question that Allah knows whatever they keep secret and whatever they make public; surely He does not love the ones waxing proud
  16,24,"And when it is said to them, \"What has your Lord sent down?\" they say, \"Myths of the earliest (people)"
  16,25,That they may carry their encumbrances complete on the Day of the Resurrection and (some) of the encumbrances of the ones that they lead into error without (any) knowledge. Verily odious is that with which they encumber themselves
  16,26,"The ones that were before them did already scheme; then Allah came upon their structure from the foundations, so the roof collapsed upon them from above them, and the torment came upon them from where they were not aware"
