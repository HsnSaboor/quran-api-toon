quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,Surely it is indeed an honorable Qur'an
  56,78,In a nestled Book
  56,79,Which none shall touch except the purified
  56,80,A successive sending down from The Lord of the worlds
  56,81,"Is it, then, that you (i.e., the disbelievers) are dissimulating with this Discourse"
  56,82,And making your provision (for livelihood) that you cry lies
  56,83,"Then had it been that, when (the self) (i.e., the self of the dying person) reaches the gullet (of the dying)"
  56,84,And you at that while of time (sit) looking on
  56,85,"And We are nearer to him than you, but you do not behold"
  56,86,"Then had you been (sure) that, in case you are other than being doomed"
  56,87,"Make it return, if (ever) you are sincere"
  56,88,"So, as for him who in case he is of those brought near (to Us)"
  56,89,"Then (there will be) relief, and soothing comfort, and a Garden of Bliss"
  56,90,And as for him who in case he is of the companions of the Right
  56,91,"Then (it will be said), \"Peace be upon you; (you are) one of the companions of the Right"
  56,92,And as for him who in case he is of the beliers (and) the erring
  56,93,Then (there will be) hospitality of scalding (water)
  56,94,And the roasting in Hell-Fire
  56,95,Surely this is indeed the very Truth of Certitude
  56,96,So extol with the Name of your Ever- Magnificent Lord
  57,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and the earth extols to Allah; and He is The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Wise"
  57,2,"To Him (belongs) the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He gives life, and He makes to die, and He is Ever-Determiner over everything"
  57,3,"He is The First and The Last, and The Outward and The Inward; (Or: The Topmost and The Innermost) and He is Ever-Knowing of everything"
