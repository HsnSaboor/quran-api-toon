quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,102,"That is Allah, your Lord, there is no god except He, the Creator of everything. So worship Him; and He is an Ever-Trusted Trustee over everything"
  6,103,"Beholdings (i.e., eyesights) cannot perceive Him, and He perceives be holdings and He is The Ever-Kind, The Ever-Cognizant"
  6,104,"Demonstrations have already come to you from your Lord; so whoever beholds, it is for his own good, (Literally: foe his \"own\" self) and whoever is blind, it is to his own harm, (Literally: upon his \"own\" self) and in no way am I (i.e. the prophet) a constant preserver over you"
  6,105,"And thus We propound the signs, and that they may say, \"You have studied, \" and that We may make it evident to a people who know"
  6,106,"Closely follow what has been revealed to you (i.e. the prophet) from your Lord; there is no god except He, and veer away from the associators (i.e., those who associate others with Allah)"
  6,107,"And if Allah had so decided, in no way would they have associated (anything with Him); and in no way have We made you a constant preserver over them; and in no way are you as a constant trustee over them"
  6,108,"And do not abuse the ones whom they invoke apart from Allah, (or) then they would abuse Allah aggressively without knowledge. Thus We have adorned (i.e., made attractive) to every nation their deed (s); thereafter to their Lord will be their return; so He will fully inform them of whatever they were doing"
  6,109,"And they have sworn by Allah the most earnest oaths, that, indeed, in case a sign comes to them, indeed they will definitely believe in it. Say, \"Surely the signs are only within the Providence of Allah; and what will make you (i.e., the believers) aware that, when it comes, they will not believe"
  6,110,"And We will turn about their heart-sights (Or: perception) and their beholdings, (i.e., eyesights) just as they did not believe in it the first time; and We will leave them out in their in ordinance blundering"
