quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  2,49,"And (remember) as We safely delivered you from the House of Firaawn (Pharaoh) (who were) marking you out for odious torment, constantly slaying your sons, and sparing alive your women; and in that (Literally: these \"atrocious acts\") was a tremendous trial from your Lord"
  2,50,And (remember) as We separated the sea for you. So We delivered you and drowned the house of Firaawn (pharaoh) (while) you were looking (at them)
  2,51,And (remember) as We appointed with Musa (Moses) forty nights; thereafter you took to yourselves the Calf even after him and you were unjust
  2,52,"Thereafter We were clement towards you even after that, that possibly you would thank (Us)"
  2,53,"And (remember) as We brought Musa (Moses) the Book and the all-distinctive Furqan, (Literally: the Criterion for right and wrong) that possibly you would be guided"
  2,54,"And (remember) as Musa (Moses) said to his people, \"O my people, surely you have done injustice to yourselves by taking the Calf to yourselves. So repent to your Initiator (and) so kill yourselves. (i.e., the unburdening of their sins; forgiveness) That (Literally: these \"killings\") is most charitable for you in the Providence of your Initiator; so He relented towards you. Surely He, Ever He, is The Superbly Relenting, The Ever-Merciful"
  2,55,"And (remember) as you said, \"O Musa (Moses) we will never believe you until we see Allah openly.\" So the (stunning) thunderbolt took you (while) you were looking on"
  2,56,"Thereafter We made you to rise again even after your death, that possibly you would thank (Us)"
  2,57,"And We overshadowed you with mists and We sent down manna and quails upon you. \"Eat of whatever good things We have provided you.\" And in no way did they do injustice to Us, but they were doing injustice to themselves"
