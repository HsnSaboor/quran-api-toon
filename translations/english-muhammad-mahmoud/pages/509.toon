quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"And the ones who have believed say, \"Had a s?rah been successively sent down!\" Then, when a clear s?rah is sent down, and therein fighting is mentioned, you see the ones in whose hearts is sickness looking at you with the look of one enveloped by the swooning of death; yet worthier of them would be"
  47,21,"Obedience and beneficent saying. Then, when the Command is resolved, then if they were sincere to Allah, indeed it would be more charitable (i.e., better) for them"
  47,22,"Then, in case you turn away, might it be that you corrupt in the earth and sever your bonds of kin"
  47,23,"Those are they whom Allah has cursed; so He made them deaf and blinded their be holdings (i.e., eyesight \"s)"
  47,24,Will they then not contemplate the Qur'an? Or are there locks upon (their) hearts
  47,25,"Surely the ones who have turned back in their traces even after the guidance has become evident to them, Ash-Shaytan (The ever-vicious) has incited them and Allah) has reprieved them"
  47,26,"That is for that they said to the ones who hate what Allah has been successively sending down, \"We will soon obey you in some of the Command.\" And Allah knows their secret (talk)"
  47,27,"So how will it be when the Angels take them up, striking their faces and their hind parts"
  47,28,That is for that they have closely followed what causes wrath from Allah and hated His all-blessed Satisfaction; so He frustrated their deeds
  47,29,Or (even) did the ones in whose hearts is sickness reckon that Allah would never bring out their malice
