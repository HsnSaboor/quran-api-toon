quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,103,"And indeed We already know that they say, \"Surely only a mortal is teaching him.\" The tongue (i.e., the language) of him about whom they blaspheme is foreign, and this is an evident Arabic tongue"
  16,104,"Surely the ones who do not believe in the signs of Allah, Allah will not guide them, and they will have a painful torment"
  16,105,"Surely they who do not believe in the signs of Allah only fabricate lies, and those are they (who are) the liars"
  16,106,"Whoever has disbelieved in Allah even after his belief excepting him who has been compelled and his heart is (still) composed with belief-but whoever has his breast expanded in disbelief, then upon them is anger from Allah and they will have a tremendous torment"
  16,107,"That (is) for that they have shown more love for the present life (Literally: the lowly life, i.e., the life of this world) than for the Hereafter and (for) that Allah does not guide the disbelieving people"
  16,108,"Those are they upon whose hearts Allah has stamped (i.e., impressed or set seal) and on their hearing and their be holdings; and those are the ones who are heedless"
  16,109,No question that in the Hereafter they are (the ones who are) the losers
  16,110,"Thereafter surely your Lord ?to the ones who emigrated even after they had been persecuted, (Literally: were tempted) thereafter strove and endured patiently, surely your Lord, even after that, is indeed Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
