quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,"No indeed, (but) you prefer the present life, (Literally: the lowly life, i.e., the life of this world)"
  87,17,"And the Hereafter is more charitable (i.e., better) and more enduring"
  87,18,Surely this is in the earliest Scrolls
  87,19,The Scrolls of Ibrahim and Musa (Abraham and Moses respectively)
  88,1,Has the discourse of the Enveloper come up to you
  88,2,Faces upon that day will be submissive
  88,3,"Laboring, toiling"
  88,4,Roasting at a Fire burning hot
  88,5,"Watered from a duly (Or: hot) (boiling) spring"
  88,6,"No food will be brought for them except from daric, (Or: cactus thorn)"
  88,7,Not to plum pen and of no avail against hunger
  88,8,(Other) faces upon that day will be blissful
  88,9,With their endeavor satisfied
  88,10,In an exalted Garden
  88,11,Therein they do not hear any idle (word)
  88,12,Therein is a running spring
  88,13,Therein are upraised settees
  88,14,And goblets set forth
  88,15,And cushions ranged
  88,16,And carpets outspread
  88,17,"Will they then not look at the camels, how they have been created"
  88,18,"And at the heaven, how it has been raised up"
  88,19,"And at the mountains, how they have been set up"
  88,20,"And at the earth, how it has been encrusted? (i.e., provided with a surface or crust)"
  88,21,So remind them! Surely you are only a constant Reminder
  88,22,You are not in any way a dominator over them
  88,23,Except for him who has turned away and disbelieved
  88,24,Then Allah will torment him with the greatest torment
  88,25,"Surely, to Us is their coming back"
  88,26,Thereafter surely upon Us is their reckoning
