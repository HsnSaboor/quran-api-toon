quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  31,12,"And indeed We already brought Luqman (the) wisdom, saying, \"Give thanks to Allah. And whoever gives thanks (to Allah), then surely he gives thanks only for himself; (i.e., for his own benefit) and whoever disbelieves, then surely Allah is Ever-Affluent, Ever-Praiseworthy"
  31,13,"And as Luqman said to his son (while) he was admonishing him, \"O my son, do not associate (others) with Allah. Surely associating (others with Allah) is indeed a monstrous injustice"
  31,14,"And We have enjoined upon man concerning his parents- his mother conceived him in feebleness upon feebleness, and his weaning was in two seasons. Give thanks to Me and to your parents; to Me is the Destiny"
  31,15,"And in case they (both) strive with you that you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, then do not obey them, and keep them company in the present (life) (Literally: the lowly \"life\", i.e., the life of this world) with beneficence. And closely follow the way of him who (turns) penitent to Me. Thereafter to Me will be your return; then I will (fully) inform you of whatever you were doing"
  31,16,"O my son, surely in case it be the weight of one grain of mustard-seed, and it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, Allah will come up with it; (i.e., bring it) surely Allah is Ever-Kind, Ever-Cognizant"
  31,17,"O my son, keep up the prayer, and command beneficence, and forbid malfeasance, and (endure) patiently whatever may afflict you. Surely that is (an indication of true) resolve concerning His Commands"
  31,18,"And do not turn your cheek away haughtily from mankind, and do not walk in the earth merrily. Surely Allah does not love everyone (who is) always conceited, (and) constantly boastful"
  31,19,"And be moderate in your walk, and tone down your voice; surely the most repugnant of voices is indeed that of the asses"
