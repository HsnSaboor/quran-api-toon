quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  4,66,"And if We had prescribed for them (saying), \"Kill yourselves, \" or \"Go out of your residences, \" in no way would they have performed (it) except a few of them. And if they had performed what they were admonished, it would have been more charitable for them and more strict in confirming them"
  4,67,"And indeed, We would have brought them from very close to Us a magnificent reward"
  4,68,And indeed We would have guided them to a straight Path
  4,69,"And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger, then those are with the ones whom Allah has favored of the Prophets, and the ones constantly sincere and the martyr-witnesses, and the righteous; and the fairest escorts those are"
  4,70,That is the Grace from Allah; and Allah suffices as (The One) Ever-Knowing
  4,71,"O you who have believed, take your wary (precautions); so march out in detachments, or march out altogether"
  4,72,"And surely among you there is indeed the one who definitely tarries behind. Then in case an affliction afflicts you, he would say, \" Allah has readily favored me, as I was not a martyr-witness with them"

  4,74,"So, let the ones fight in the way of Allah, (the ones) who barter the present life (Literally: the lowly life, i.e., the life of this world) (seeking) the Hereafter. And whoever fights in the way of Allah (and) is killed or overcomes, then We will eventually bring him a magnificent reward"
