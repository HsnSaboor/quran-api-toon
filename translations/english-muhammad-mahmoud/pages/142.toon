quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,111,"And if We Ourselves had been sending down the Angels to them, and the dead had spoken to them, and We had mustered against them everything, face to face, (Or: in array) in no way indeed would they have been to believe except (when) Allah decides; but most of them are ignorant"
  6,112,"And thus We have made to every Prophet an enemy: Shayatin All-vicious (ones), i.e., devils) of humankind and jinn, revealing fanciful (Literally: decorated) speech to each other, (all) as delusion. And if your Lord had (so) decided, in no way would they have performed it. So leave them out to whatever they fabricate"
  6,113,"And (this is so) that the heart-sights of (the ones) who do not believe in the Hereafter may be readily attentive, and that they may be satisfied with it, and that they may score whatever they are scoring"
  6,114,"(say, ) \"Then, shall I inequitably seek other than Allah for arbiter, and He is (The One) Who has sent down to you the Book (clearly) expounded?\" And the ones to whom We brought the Book know that it is being sent down from your Lord with the Truth, so do not definitely be of the constant wranglers"
  6,115,"And perfected is the Word of your Lord in sincerity and justice; nothing whatever can exchange His Words; and He is the Ever-Hearer, The Ever-Knowing"
  6,116,"And in case you obey most of whoever are on earth, (Literally: in the earth) they will make you err away from the way of Allah; decidedly they closely follow nothing except surmise, and decidedly they do (nothing) except conjecture"
  6,117,"Surely your Lord is He Who knows best who errs away from His way, and He knows best the rightly-guided"
  6,118,"So eat of that over which The Name of Allah has been mentioned, in case you are believers in His signs"
