quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  51,52,"Thus in no way did (any) Messenger come up to the ones even before them except that they said, \"A sorcerer or a madman"
  51,53,"Have they enjoined (this saying) one to another? No indeed, (but) they are an inordinate people"

  52,10,And the mountains travel with (awful) traveling
  52,11,Then woe upon that day to the beliers
  52,12,"They are the ones who play at their wading, (i.e., become absorbed)"
  52,13,The Day when they are repulsed to the fire of Hell with (contemptuous) repulsing
  52,14,This is the Fire that you used to cry lies to
