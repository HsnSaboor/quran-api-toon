quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  46,6,"And when mankind are mustered, they will be enemies to them and will be disbelievers of having been worshiped (by the associators. (i.e., those who associate others with Allah)"
  46,7,"And when Our ayat (Verses, signs) are recited to them, supremely evident signs, the disbelievers say to the Truth as soon as it has come to them, \"This is evident sorcery"
  46,8,"Or even they say, \"He has fabricated it.\" Say, \"In case I have fabricated it, then you do not possess for me anything from Allah. He knows best what you confide among yourselves He suffices as an Ever-Present Witness between me and you, and He is The Ever-Forgiving, The Ever-Merciful"
  46,9,"Say, \"In no way am I an innovation among the Messengers, and in no way can I realize what will be performed upon me or upon you. Decidedly I closely follow (nothing) except what is revealed to me; and in no way am I (anything) except an evident, constant warner"
  46,10,"Say, \"Have you seen that in case it is from the Providence of Allah and you have disbelieved in it, and a witness from among the Seeds (Or: sons) of Israel) testifies to its like and has believed, and you wax proud-surely Allah does not guide the unjust people"
  46,11,"And the ones who have disbelieved have said to the ones who have believed, \"If it had been of any charity, (i.e. benefit) in no way would they have outstripped us to it.\" (i.e., received it before us) And as they have not been guided by it, then they will soon say, \"This is an old falsehood"
  46,12,"And before it was the Book of Musa, (Moses) a leader (Or: a record, a register) and a mercy; and this is a Book sincerely (verifying), in the Arabic tongue, to warn the ones who do injustice, and good tidings to the fair-doers"
  46,13,"Surely the ones who have said, \"Our Lord is Allah, \" thereafter have gone straight, then no fear will be on them, nor will they grieve"
  46,14,"Those are the companions (i.e., inhabitants) of the Garden, eternally (abiding) therein as a recompense for whatever they were doing"
