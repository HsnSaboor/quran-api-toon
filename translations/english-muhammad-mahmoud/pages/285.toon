quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,28,"And in case ever you definitely veer away from them, seeking mercy from your Lord that you hope for, then speak to them a reasonable saying"
  17,29,"And do not set up your hand shackled to your neck, (i.e., Do not be niggardly) nor outspread it widespread altogether, (Literally: outspread it all outspreading, i.e., do not be a spendthrift) for then you will sit blamed and regretfully rejected"
  17,30,Surely your Lord outspreads the provision to whomever He decides and estimates (it); surely He has been Ever-Cognizant of (and) Ever-Beholding His bondmen
  17,31,And do not kill your children in apprehension of want; We provide for them and for you (too); surely the killing of them has been a great sinning
  17,32,And do not come near to adultery; surely it has been an obscenity and odious as a way
  17,33,"And do not kill the self that Allah has prohibited, except by truthful (right) (Literally: with the truth). And whoever is killed unjustly, We have (already) appointed to his patron authority. So let him not exceed (Literally: be extravagant) in killing; surely he will be vindicated"
  17,34,And do not draw near the wealth of the orphan except in the fairest (manner) until he reaches full age; and fulfil the covenant. Surely the covenant will be questioned of
  17,35,"And fill up the measure when you measure, and weigh with the straight equitableness; that is more charitable and fairest in interpretation (Or: determination, outcome)"
  17,36,"And do not pursue what you have no knowledge of; surely hearing and beholding and heart-sight, (Or: perception) all of those will be questioned of"
  17,37,"And do not walk in the earth merrily; surely you will never pierce the earth, and you will never reach the mountains in height"
  17,38,"All of that, the odiousness of it is hateful in the Meeting of your Lord"
