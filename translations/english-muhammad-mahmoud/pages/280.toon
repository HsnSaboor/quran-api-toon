quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,111,"The Day that every self will come up disputing for it self, and every self will be paid in full for what it has done, and they will not be done any injustice"
  16,112,"And Allah has struck a similitude: a town that was secure (and) well composed, its provision coming up to it opulently from every place, then it disbelieved (i.e., they were unthankful) in the amenities of Allah; so Allah made it taste the garment of hunger and fear for the things they were working out (i.e., doing)"
  16,113,"And indeed a Messenger from among them already came to them, then they cried him lies; so the torment took them (away) and they were unjust"
  16,114,"So eat of what Allah has provided you, lawfully good, and thank (Him) for the favor of Allah, in case it be Him only that you do worship"
  16,115,"Surely He has prohibited for you only carrion, (i.e., deal meat) and blood, and the flesh of swine, and what has been acclaimed to other than Allah. Yet whoever is constrained, without being inequitable or aggressive, then surely Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
  16,116,"And do not say, as to what your tongues describe lying, (i.e., falsely, livingly) \"This is lawful and this is prohibited, \" so you may fabricate lies against Allah; surely the ones who fabricate lies against Allah will not prosper"
  16,117,A little enjoyment and they will have a painful torment
  16,118,"And for the ones who Judaized, (i.e., adopt Judaism) We have prohibited for them what we narrated to you earlier and in no way did We do them an injustice, but to themselves they were doing injustice"
