quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  4,20,"And in case you are willing to exchange a spouse in place of (another) spouse, and you have brought one of them a hundredweight, (Literally: a Kantar) then do not take anything of it. Will you take it by way of all-malicious (calumny) and evident vice"
  4,21,"And how should you take it, and each of you has already gone privily with the other, (Literally: some of you have been privily with (some) and they have taken from you a solemn compact"
  4,22,"And do not marry women that your fathers married, except what has already gone by; surely that is an obscenity and detestation, and an odious way"
  4,23,"Prohibited to you are your mothers and your daughters, and your sisters, and your paternal aunts, and your maternal aunts, and (your) brother's daughters, and (your) sister's daughters, and your mothers who have given suck to you, and your suckling sisters, and your women's mothers, and your step-daughters who are in your laps (i.e. under your guardianship) being born of your women whom you have been into-yet, in case you have not been into them, (Literally: entered with) it is no fault in you-and the lawful (spouses) of your sons who are of your loins, and that you should take to you two sisters together, except what has already gone by. Surely Allah has been Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
