quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,"And that He created the two pairs, the male and the female"
  53,46,From a sperm drop when it is ejaculated
  53,47,And that upon Him (rests) the other engendering
  53,48,"And that He, Ever He, enriches and gives property"
  53,49,"And that He, Ever He, is The Lord of Sirius; (Ash-Shicra, a star that was worshiped before Islam)"
  53,50,And that He caused to perish the earliest Aad
  53,51,And Thamud; so He did not spare (any of them)
  53,52,And the people of Nuh (Noah) earlier; surely they were the ones who were more unjust and more inordinate
  53,53,"And the City of Falsehood, He (also) made it sweep down"
  53,54,So that (there) He constantly enveloped it whatever He constantly enveloped
  53,55,Then whichever of your Lord's boons do you wrangle about
  53,56,"This is a Warner, of the earliest Warnings"
  53,57,TheImminent is imminent
  53,58,"Apart from Allah, none can lift it off"
  53,59,Do you then wonder at this discourse
  53,60,"And do you laugh, and do you not weep"
  53,61,(While) you amuse yourselves
  53,62,So prostrate yourselves to Allah and worship (Him).A prostration is to be performed here
  54,1,"The Hour (The Arabic noun is feminine) has drawn near, and the moon (The Arabic noun is masculine) is cloven"
  54,2,"And in case they see a sign, they veer away and say, \"A continuous sorcery"
  54,3,And they have cried lies and closely followed their prejudices; and every Command is settled
  54,4,And indeed there have already come to them such tidings wherein there is a scaring
  54,5,A consummate Wisdom; yet in no way do warnings avail
  54,6,So turn away from them. On the Day when the Caller will call to a highly maleficent thing
