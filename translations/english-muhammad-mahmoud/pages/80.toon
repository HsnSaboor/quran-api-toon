  4,15,"And (as for) the ones of your women who come up with the obscenity, (i.e., illegal sexual intercourse; abomination) so, call four of you to witness against them.

  4,18,"And relenting is not for the ones who do odious deeds until, when death is present to one of them, he says, \"Surely now I repent, \" neither (for) the ones who die (while) they are steadfast disbelievers; for those We have readied a painful torment"
  4,19,"O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will; (Literally: through compulsion) neither pose problems for them that you may go away with some (part) of what you have brought them except when they come up with a (demonstrably) evident obscenity.
