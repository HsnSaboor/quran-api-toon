quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  57,4,"He is The One Who created the heavens and the earth in six days; thereafter He leveled Himself upon the Throne (How He did this is beyond human understanding). He knows whatever penetrates into the earth and whatever goes out of it, and whatever comes down from the heaven and whatever ascends (with difficulty) in it, and He is with you wherever you are; and Allah is Ever-Beholding whatever you do"
  57,5,"To Him (belongs) the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and to Allah (all) Commands are returned"
  57,6,"He inserts the night into the daytime, and He inserts the daytime into the night; and He is Ever-Knowing of the inmost (thoughts within) the breasts (Literally: what the breasts own)"
  57,7,Believe in Allah and His Messenger; and expend of that to which He has made you successors. So the ones of you who have believed and expended will have a great reward
  57,8,"And how is it with you as you do not believe in Allah? And the Messenger is calling you to believe in your Lord, and He has already taken compact with you, in case you are believers"
  57,9,"He is (The One) Who keeps sending down upon His Bondman signs, supremely evident (signs), that He may bring you out of the darkness (es) into the light; and surely Allah is indeed to you Ever-Compassionate, Ever-Merciful"
  57,10,"And how is it with you (Literally: what is it with you) that you do not expend in the way of Allah, and to Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth? Not equal is he among you who spent even before the Conquest and fought; those are more magnificent in degree than they who spent even after (that) and fought; and to each Allah has promised the fairest reward; and Allah is Ever-Cognizant of whatever you do"
  57,11,"Who is he that will lend to Allah a fair loan, so He will double it for him, and he will have an honorable reward"
