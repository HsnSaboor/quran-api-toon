quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  17,67,"And when adversity touches you in the sea, the ones whom you invoke err away (from you) except Him (only); then as soon as He safely delivers you to land, you veer away. And man has been constantly disbelieving (i.e., ever-thankless)"
  17,68,"Do you then (feel) secure that He will not cause a side of the land to cave you in, or send against you a squall of gravel? Thereafter you will find no constant trustee for you"
  17,69,"Or even do you (feel) secure that He will not bring you back into it on another occasion, so send against you a rumbling wind (and) so drown you for that you have disbelieved? Thereafter you will find no attending followers for you against Us"
  17,70,"And indeed We have already honored the Seeds (Or: sons) of Adam and carried them on land and sea, (Literally: in the land the sea) and provided them of the good (things), and graced them over many of whom We created with marked graciousness"
  17,71,"On the Day (when) We will call all folks with theirImam; (Their leader; or: their record, their register) so whoever is brought his book with his right (hand), then those will read their book and they will not be done any injustice, even (to) a single date-plaiting (i.e., not even to a small degree)"
  17,72,"And whoever is blind in this (life), then he will be blind in the Hereafter and will be (even) further erring away from the way"
  17,73,"And decidedly they were indeed almost about to tempt you (The Prophet) from (that) which We have revealed to you, that you might fabricate against Us another, and lo, they would have indeed taken you to themselves a (close) fellow"
  17,74,"And if we had not made you stand firm, indeed you were already almost about to (seek) support from them a (very) little"
  17,75,Then indeed We would have let you taste the double of life and the double of dying; thereafter you would have found none to be a ready vindicator against Us
