quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  65,6,"Make them dwell (in some part of the housing) where you are dwelling, according to your means, and do not try to hurt them, so as to straiten (their circumstances). And in case they are with burden, (i.e., pregnant) then expend upon them until they bring forth their burden. So in case they suckle for you, then bring them their rewards, and deliberate among yourselves beneficently; and in case you (both) encounter) difficulties, then another (woman shall suckle for him)"
  65,7,"Let him who is owner of affluence expend out of his affluence; and he whose provision has been exactly estimated for him, then let him expend of what Allah has brought him. Allah does not charge any self except with what He has brought it. Allah will soon make, after difficulty, easiness"
  65,8,"And (similarly) (many) a town there has been that rebelled against the Command of its Lord and His Messengers, so We reckoned with it a strict reckoning, and tormented it a highly maleficent torment"
  65,9,So it tasted the pernicious result of the Command (of Allah) to it; and the end of the Command (to it) was loss
  65,10,"Allah has prepared for them a strict torment. So be pious to Allah, O (you) endowed with intellects, (you) who have believed. Allah has already sent down to you a Remembrance"
  65,11,"A Messenger reciting to you the demonstrably evident ayat (Verses, signs) of Allah, that He may bring the ones who have believed and done deeds of righteousness out of the darkness (es) into the Light. And whoever believes in Allah and does righteousness, He will cause him to enter Gardens from beneath which rivers run, eternally (abiding) therein forever. Allah has already most fairly made for him (his) provision"
  65,12,"Allah is He Who created seven heavens, and of the earth their like. Between them the Command keeps coming down, that you may know that Allah is Ever-Determiner over everything and that Allah has already encompassed everything in knowledge"
