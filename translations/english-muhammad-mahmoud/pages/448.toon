quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"He (always) said, Are you surely of the ones who indeed count it sincerely (verified)"
  37,53,"When we die and are dust and bones, will we surely be doomed (Or: judged) indeed"
  37,54,"He says, \"Are you (all) viewing (him)"
  37,55,"So he views (him), and then sees him in the (deepest) level of the Hell-Fire"
  37,56,"He says, \"By Allah, (The Arabic is ta-llahi; which a stronger oath than the more usual wa-llahi) decidedly you were almost about to topple me down indeed"
  37,57,"And had it not been for the favor of my Lord, indeed I would have been among the ones presented forward"
  37,58,Then in no way will we be dead
  37,59,"Except for our first death, and in no way will we be tormented"
  37,60,Surely this is indeed that which is magnificent triumph
  37,61,For the like of this let the doers do (good deeds)
  37,62,"Is this a more charitable (i.e., better) hospitality, or even the Tree of Az-Zaqqum"
  37,63,"Surely We have made it as a temptation (Or: trial) for the unjust"
  37,64,"Surely it is a tree that comes out (Literally: goes out) in the root of Hell-Fire"
  37,65,"Its spathes are as the heads of Shayatun. (Ever-vicious (ones), i.e., devils"
  37,66,"Then surely they will indeed be eating of it, and so of it they will be filling their bellies"
  37,67,Thereafter on top of it surely they will have indeed an admixture of scalding (water)
  37,68,Thereafter surely their return indeed is to Hell-Fire
  37,69,Surely they came upon their fathers erring
  37,70,So they are made to hurry in their tracks
  37,71,And indeed before them already erred away most of the earliest (people)
  37,72,And indeed We already sent among them warners
  37,73,So look into how was the end of the warned people
  37,74,Except for the most faithful bondmen of Allah
  37,75,"And indeed, Nuh (Noah) already called out to Us; (i.e., Allah, through the Angels) so how excellent indeed were The Answerers"
  37,76,And We safely delivered him and his family from the tremendous agony
