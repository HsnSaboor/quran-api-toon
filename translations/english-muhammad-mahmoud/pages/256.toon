quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  14,6,"And as Musa said to his people, \"Remember the favor of Allah upon you as He delivered you from the house of Firaawn, (Pharaoh) (who were) marking you out for odious torment, constantly slaying your sons and (sparing) alive your women; and in these (acts) was a tremendous trial from your Lord"
  14,7,"And as your Lord has notified (you), \"Indeed in case you thank (Him), indeed I will definitely increase you and indeed in case you disbelieve, surely My torment is indeed strict"
  14,8,"And Musa (Moses) said, \"In case you disbelieve, you and whoever is in the earth altogether, then surely Allah is indeed Ever-Affluent, (Literally: Ever-Rich) Ever-Praiseworthy"
  14,9,"Has there not come up to you the tidings of the ones who were even before you, the people of Nuh (Literally: Renderer; i.e., creator) and c?d and Thamud and of the ones even after them? None knows them except Allah. Their Messengers came to them with the Supreme evidences; yet they turned back their hands in their mouths (i.e., put their hands in their mouths \"biting them in anger\") and said, \"Surely we disbelieve in what you have been sent with, and surely we are indeed in doubt concerning that to which you call us, causing suspicion"
  14,10,"Their Messengers said, \"Is there any doubt regarding Allah, The Originator (Literally: Renderer; i.e., creator) of the heavens and the earth? He calls you that He may forgive you (some) of your guilty deeds and to defer you to a stated term.\" They said, \"Decidedly you are nothing except mortals like us; you would (like) to bar us from what our fathers were worshiping; then come up to us with an evident all-binding authority"
