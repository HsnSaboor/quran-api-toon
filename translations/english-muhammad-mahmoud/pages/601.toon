quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,"And (by) the afternoon! (Or: time)"
  103,2,Surely man is indeed in (sheer) loss
  103,3,"Except the ones who have believed, and done deeds of righteousness, and enjoin each other to the Truth, and enjoin each other to patience"
  104,1,"Woe to every persistent slanderer, persistent defamer"
  104,2,Who has gathered wealth and counted it over
  104,3,He reckons that his wealth has made him eternal
  104,4,Not at all! Indeed he will definitely be flung off into the Crusher
  104,5,And what makes you realize what the Crusher is
  104,6,(It is) the Fire of Allah kindled
  104,7,Which views the heart-sights
  104,8,"Surely it is vaulted over (i.e., with no outlet) upon them"
  104,9,In pillars widely extended
  105,1,"Have you not seen how your Lord performed with the companions (i.e., owners) of the elephant"
  105,2,Did He not make their plotting go into great error
  105,3,And He sent upon them baleful birds (in flocks)
  105,4,Throwing against them stones of baked clay
  105,5,So He made them like green blades eaten (up)
