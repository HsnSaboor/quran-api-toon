quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,27,"Thereafter Allah even after that relents towards whomever He decides; and Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
  9,28,"O you who have believed, surely the associators (Those who associate others with Allah) are only an impurity; so they should not come near the Inviolable Mosque after this season (Literally: after this duration = (this year) of theirs. And if you fear want, then Allah will eventually enrich you of His Grace, in case He (so) decides; surely Allah is Ever-Knowing, Ever-Wise"
  9,29,"Fight the ones who do not believe in Allah nor in the Last Day, and do not prohibit whatever Allah and His Messenger have prohibited, and do not practice (Literally: to have as a religion) the religion of Truth-from among the ones to whom the Book was brought-until they give the tax out of hand (i.e., by a ready money payment, or in token of submission) and have been belittled"
  9,30,"And the Jews have said, \"cUzayr (i.e. Ezra) is the son of Allah. \"And the Nasara (i.e. the Christians) have said, Al-Masih (The Messiah) is the son of Allah.\" That is their saying with their mouths, conforming with the saying of the disbelievers earlier. Allah fights them! However are they diverged (into) falsehood"
  9,31,"They have taken to themselves as lords, apart from Allah, their doctors and their monks and Al-Masih, (The Messiah) the son of Maryam; (Mary) and in no way were they commanded to worship (anyone) except One God; there is no god except He; All extolment be to Him, (He is) above whatever they associate (with Him)"
