quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"Said he, \"So, what is your concern, you Emissaries"
  51,32,"They said, \"Surely we have been sent to a criminal people"
  51,33,To send upon them stones of clay
  51,34,Marked in the Reckoning of your Lord for the extravagant
  51,35,Then We brought out whoever of the believers who were in it
  51,36,"Yet, in no way did We find therein other than one house of Muslims; (i.e., those who surrender themselves to Allah)"
  51,37,And We have left in it a sign to the ones who fear the painful torment
  51,38,"And (also there is a sign) in Musa (Moses) as We sent him to Firaawn (pharaoh) with an evident, all- binding authority"
  51,39,"Yet he turned away, with his (court) supporters, and said, \"A sorcerer or a madman"
  51,40,"So We took him (away) and his hosts; then We flung them off in the main, (and) he was blameworthy"
  51,41,And (also there is a sign) in c?d as We sent against them the sterile wind
  51,42,In no way did it come upon anything except that it left it out (and) made it as a rotten (stuff)
  51,43,"And (also there is a sign) in Thamud as it was said to them, \"Take your enjoyment for a while"
  51,44,Yet they rebelled against the Command of their Lord; so that stunning (thunderbolt) took them (away) (while) they were looking on
  51,45,"So in no way were they able to be upright, and in no way were they vindicators"
  51,46,"And the people of Nuh (Noah) earlier, surely they were an immoral people"
  51,47,"And the heaven (is also a sign). We have built it with (Our) Hands (i.e., Capability) and surely We are indeed extending (it) wide"
  51,48,"And the earth, We have laid it out (as) a bedding, so how excellent are the Smoothers! (i.e., Those who make the earth as a cradle)"
  51,49,"And of everything We created pairs, that possibly you would be mindful"
  51,50,"So flee to Allah! Surely I am an evident, constant warner from Him to you"
  51,51,"And do not set up with Allah another god; surely I am an evident, constant warner from Him to you"
