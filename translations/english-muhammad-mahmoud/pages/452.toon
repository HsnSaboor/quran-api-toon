quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,"How is it with you, how do you judge"
  37,155,Will you then not be mindful
  37,156,Or even do you have an evident all- binding authority
  37,157,"Then come up with your Book, in case you are sincere"
  37,158,And they have made up a consanguity between Him and the jinn; and indeed the jinn already know that surely they will indeed be presented forward
  37,159,All Extolment be to Allah above what they describe
  37,160,Except (for) the most faithful bondmen of Allah
  37,161,Yet surely you and whatever you worship
  37,162,In no way will you tempt any against Him
  37,163,Except (for) him who will roast in Hell-Fire
  37,164,"And in no way is there one of us, (i.e., the angels) except that he has a known station"
  37,165,"And surely we, indeed we, are the ones ranged in ranks"
  37,166,"And surely we, indeed we, are the extollers (of Allah)"
  37,167,"And decidedly they (i.e., the disbelievers) indeed used to say"
  37,168,"If only we had in our presence a Remembrance (i.e., Scriptures) from the earliest (people)"
  37,169,Indeed we would be the most faithful bondmen of Allah
  37,170,Yet they disbelieved in it; then eventually they will know
  37,171,"And indeed Our Word has already gone before to Our bondmen, the Emissaries"
  37,172,"Surely they, indeed they, will be vindicated"
  37,173,"And surely Our hosts, indeed they, will be the overcomers"
  37,174,So turn away from them for a while
  37,175,And behold them; then they will eventually behold
  37,176,Do they then seek to hasten Our torment
  37,177,"So when it comes down in their courtyard, then how odious will be the morning of them that are constantly warned"
  37,178,And turn away from them for a while
  37,179,And behold; then they will eventually behold
  37,180,"All Extolment be to your Lord, The Lord of Might, above whatever they describe"
  37,181,And peace be upon the Emissaries
  37,182,"And praise be to Allah, The Lord of the worlds"
