quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,"(As) they are made to behold them (i.e., each other). The criminal would like that he might ransom himself of the torment upon that Day (even) by his seeds"
  70,12,And his female companion and his brother
  70,13,And the nearest of his kin who gave him abode
  70,14,"And whoever is in the earth all together, so that thereafter it might deliver him"
  70,15,Not at all! Surely it is a fierce Blaze
  70,16,Constantly plucking forth the scalps
  70,17,Calling him who withdrew and turned away
  70,18,And (who) gathered (riches); (so he) prudently kept them
  70,19,Surely man was created most fretful
  70,20,"When evil touches him, (he is) most impatient"
  70,21,"And when charity touches him, (he is) a constant preventer of it"
  70,22,Except the ones who are (constantly) praying
  70,23,They are the ones who are permanently preserving their prayers
  70,24,And (they) are the ones in whose riches is a truthful (duty) known
  70,25,For the beggar and the dispossessed
  70,26,And the ones who sincerely (believe) in the Day of Doom
  70,27,And they are the ones who are timorous of the torment of their Lord
  70,28,"Surely the torment of their Lord (leaves) none secure (Literally: other than to be secure)"
  70,29,And they are the ones who preserve their private parts
  70,30,"Except with their spouses or what their right hands possess; then surely they are not blameworthy (Literally: other than being blameworthy)"
  70,31,"Yet, whoever inequitably seeks (anything) beyond that, then those are the ones who are the aggressors"
  70,32,"And they (The thought continues from verse 29) are the ones who pay heed (i.e., rightly observe) to their deposits and their covenant"
  70,33,And they are the ones who keep up their testimonies
  70,34,And they are the ones who (strictly) preserve their prayer
  70,35,"Those will be in Gardens, high-honored"
  70,36,"So, for what (reason) are the ones who have disbelieved (hurrying with heads) protruding, facing you"
  70,37,On the right and on the left in sundry batches
  70,38,Does every person of them long to be made to enter a Garden of Bliss
  70,39,Not at all! Surely We created them of what they know
