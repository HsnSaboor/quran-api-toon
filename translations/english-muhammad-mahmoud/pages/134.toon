  6,53,"And thus We have tempted some of them by (others) (Literally: by some \"others\") that they may say, \"Are these (the ones) Allah has been bounteous to among us?\" Is not Allah the Best Knower of the thankful"
  6,54,"And when the ones who believe in Our signs come to you, then say, \"Peace be upon you. Your Lord has prescribed for Himself (the) mercy, that whoever of you does an odious deed in ignorance, thereafter repents even after that and acts righteously, then (say) that He is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
  6,55,"And thus We expound the signs, and that the way of the criminals may become evident"
  6,56,"Say, \"Surely I am forbidden to worship the ones you invoke apart from Allah.\" Say, \"I do not ever follow your prejudices, (then) lo, I have already erred, and in no way would I be of the rightly- guided"
  6,57,"Say, \"Surely I am on a supreme evidence from my Lord and you have cried lies to it. In no way do I have whatever you seek to hasten; decidedly the judgment is with none except Allah. He narrates the Truth, and He is The Most Charitable of verdict givers"
  6,58,"Say, \"If whatever you seek to hasten were in my presence, the Command between me and you would indeed be decreed, and Allah is the Best Knower of the unjust"

And in no way does a leaf fall down, except that He knows it, and not a grain in the darkness (es) of the earth, not a thing wet or dry, except that it is in an evident Book"
