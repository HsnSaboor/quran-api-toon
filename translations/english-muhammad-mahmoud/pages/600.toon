quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,And whatever is in the breasts is sought out
  100,11,Surely upon that Day their Lord is indeed of them Ever-Cognizant
  101,1,The Smiter
  101,2,What is the Smiter
  101,3,And what makes you realize what the Smiter is
  101,4,The Day (whereon) mankind will be like disseminated moths
  101,5,And the mountains will be like carded wool tufts
  101,6,"Then, as for him whose scales weigh heavy, (i.e., with good deeds)"
  101,7,So he will be in a satisfied livelihood
  101,8,"And, as for him whose scales weigh light, (i.e., with deeds)"
  101,9,"Then his home is the bottom of Hell (Literally: his mother is tumbling into Hell)"
  101,10,And what makes you realize what it is
  101,11,(It is) a Fire burning hot
  102,1,(Gross) multiplying diverts you
  102,2,Till you visit the cemeteries

  102,4,"Again (Literally: Thereafter) not at all! (But) eventually you will know"
  102,5,Not at all! (But) if you know with the knowledge of certitude
  102,6,Indeed you will definitely see Hell-Fire
  102,7,"(Again), (Literally: Thereafter) indeed you will definitely see it with the eye of certitude"
  102,8,Thereafter indeed you will definitely be questioned upon that Day concerning (the worldly) bliss
