quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,80,"And Allah has made for you of your homes a dwelling, and made for you from the skins of (the) cattle homes (that) you find light on the day of your sojourning and on the day of your stationary abode, and of their wool (Literally: wools) and of their furs and of their hairs furnishings and an enjoyment for a while"
  16,81,"And Allah has made for you of what He created shades, and He has made for you of the mountains nestled (refuges), and He has made for you apparels to protect you from the heat and apparels to protect you from your (own) violence. Thus He perfects His favor upon you, that possibly you would be Muslims (Literally: surrender \"to Him)"
  16,82,"So, in case they turn away, then surely you have only (to deliver) the evident proclamation"
  16,83,They recognize the favor of Allah; thereafter they deny it; and most of them are the disbelievers
  16,84,And the Day We make to rise again from every nation a witness; thereafter the ones who disbelieved will not be permitted nor will they be allowed to make amends
  16,85,"And when the ones who did injustice see the torment, then it will not be lightened for them, and they will not be respited"
  16,86,"And when the ones who associated (others with Him) see their associates, they will say, \"Our Lord, these are our associates whom we used to invoke apart from You.\" They will then cast at them the saying, \"Surely you are liars indeed"
  16,87,"And they will cast forth to Allah submissiveness upon that Day and whatever they used to fabricate will err away (Or: stray away) from them"
