quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,71,"Say, \"Have you seen (that) in case Allah should make the night unceasing over you till the Day of the Resurrection, what god other than Allah will come up to you with (i.e., bring) illumination? Will you not then hear"
  28,72,"Say, \"Have you seen (that) in case Allah should make the daytime unceasing over you till the Day of the Resurrection, what god other than Allah shall come up to you with (i.e., bring) night to rest in? Will you not then behold"
  28,73,"And of His mercy He has made the night and the daytime for you to rest in, and to seek after His Grace, and that possibly you would thank (Him)"
  28,74,"And on the Day when He will call out to them, so He will say, \"Where are My associates whom you were asserting"
  28,75,"And We will draw out from every nation a constant witness, so We will say, \"Offer your proof!\" Then will they know that to Allah belongs the Truth, and (there) will be lost from (Literally: err from them) them whatever they were fabricating"
  28,76,"Surely Qarun (Korah) was of the people of Musa, (Moses) yet he was inequitable to them. And We brought him hoardings such that the (very) keys of them would indeed overburden a band (of men) endowed with power. As his people said to him, \"Do not exult; surely Allah does not love the exultant"
  28,77,"And seek, in whatever Allah has brought you, the Last Home, and do not forget your assignment of the present (life); (Literally: the lowly \"life\", i.e., the life of this world) and be fair (to others) as Allah has been fair to you. And do not inequitably seek to work corruption in the land; surely Allah does not love the corruptors"
