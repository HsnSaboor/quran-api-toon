quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  72,1,"Say, \"It has been revealed to me that a batch of the jinn listened; then they said, Surely we have heard a wondrous Qur'an"
  72,2,"Guiding to right-mindedness; so we believe in it, and we will never associate with our Lord anyone"
  72,3,And (we believe) that He-Supremely Exalted be our Lord's Dignity- in no way has He taken to Him either a female companion or a child
  72,4,And that the foolish (ones) among us used to speak against Allah unjudiciously
  72,5,And that we surmised that humankind and the jinn would never speak against Allah a lie
  72,6,And that (certain) men of the humankind used to take refuge with (certain) men of the jinn; so they increased them in oppression
  72,7,"And that they surmised, as you (The pronoun is plural) also surmised, that Allah would never make anyone to rise again"
  72,8,"And that we contacted the heaven, yet we found it filled with very strict guards and flaming (meteors)"
  72,9,And that we used to sit (there) on seats for (over)hearing; yet whoever listens now finds a flaming (meteor) (closely) observing him
  72,10,"And that we do not realize whether evil is willed for whoever are in the earth, or whether their Lord wills for them rectitude"
  72,11,"And that among us are the righteous, and among us are lesser than that; (i.e., besides that) we have been of discrete roads"
  72,12,"And that we surmised that we can never defy Allah in the earth, and we can never defy Him by escaping"
  72,13,"And that as soon as we heard the guidance, we believed in it; so whoever believes in his Lord, then he fears neither depreciation nor oppression"
