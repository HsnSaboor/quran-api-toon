quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  76,26,"And (part) of the night; so prostrate yourself to Him, and extol Him through the long night"
  76,27,Surely these (people) love the hasty (world) and leave behind them a heavy Day
  76,28,"We, Ever We, created them, and We have upheld their frames; and when We (so) decide, We will exchange their likes, an (easy) exchange"
  76,29,"Surely this is a Reminder; so whoever decides, (may) take (to himself) a way to his Lord"
  76,30,"And in no way can you (Literally: mankind) decide unless Allah (so) decides; surely Allah has been Ever-Knowing, Ever-Wise"
  76,31,He causes whomever He decides to enter into His mercy; and for the unjust (ones) He has prepared a painful torment
  77,1,And (by) the emissaries in a (continual) series with benevolence
  77,2,Then (by) tempests (storming) tempestuously
  77,3,And (by) the spreaders spreading
  77,4,Then (by) the ones who separate with a (distinct) separation
  77,5,Then (by) the ones casting a Remembrance
  77,6,Excusing or warning
  77,7,Surely that which you are promised is indeed befalling
  77,8,So when the stars will be obliterated
  77,9,And when the heaven will be riven
  77,10,And when the mountains will be crushed
  77,11,And when the Messengers' (time) is fixed
  77,12,To whichever Day is (this) term appointed
  77,13,To the Day of Verdict
  77,14,And what makes you realize what the Day of Verdict is
  77,15,Upon that Day woe to the beliers
  77,16,Did We not cause the earliest people to perish
  77,17,Thereafter We make the later generations follow them up
  77,18,Thus We perform against the criminals
  77,19,Upon that Day woe to the beliers
