quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,171,"And (remember) as We agitated the mountain above them as if it were an overshadowing (awning) and they expected it was going to fall down on them: \"Take powerfully what We have brought you, and remember what is in it, that possibly you would be pious"
  7,172,"And (remember) as your Lord took from the Seeds (Or. sons) of Adam, from their backs, their offspring, and made them bear witness concerning themselves, \"Am I not your Lord?\" They said, \"Yes indeed, we bear witness.\" (So) that you should not say on the Day of the Resurrection, \"Surely we were heedless of this"
