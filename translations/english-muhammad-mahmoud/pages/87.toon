quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,52,"Those are they whom Allah has cursed; and whomever Allah has cursed, then you will not find for him a ready vindicator"
  4,53,"Or even do they have an assignment in the Kingdom? Then, lo, they do not bring mankind even a groove in a datestone"
  4,54,"Or even do they envy mankind (i.e. Muhammad and the believers) for whatever Allah has brought them of His Grace? Then We have brought the house of Ibrahim (Abraham) the Book and (the) Wisdom, and We have brought them a magnificent Kingdom"
  4,55,"Then of them there were (some) who believed therein, and there were (some) who barred from it; and Hell suffices for a Blaze"
  4,56,"Surely the ones who have disbelieved in Our signs, We will eventually roast them at a Fire; whenever their skins are maturated, (Literally: ripened) We give them in exchange other skins that they may taste the torment. Surely Allah has been Ever-Mighty, Ever-Wise"
  4,57,"And (the ones) who have believed and done deeds of righteousness, We will soon cause them to enter Gardens from beneath which Rivers run, eternally (abiding) therein forever; they have therein purified spouses and We cause them therein plenteous shade (literally: a very shady shade)"
  4,58,"Surely Allah commands you to pay deposits back to their qualified family (i.e. the owners) and, when you judge among mankind, that you judge with justice. How favorable is that to which Allah surely admonishes you; surely Allah has been Ever-Hearing, Ever-Beholding"
  4,59,"O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and the ones endowed with the command (i.e. those in authority) among you. So in case you contend together about anything, then refer it to Allah and the Messenger, in case you believe in Allah and the Last Day; that is most charitable (i.e. most beneficial) and fairest in interpretation"
