quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,In no way will avail them whatever they had been given to enjoy
  26,208,And in no way did We cause (any) town to perish except that it had warners
  26,209,"For a Reminding, and in no way have We been unjust"
  26,210,"And in no way have Ash-Shayatin (The ever-Vicious (ones), i.e., the devils) been coming down with it"
  26,211,"And in no way does it behoove them, And in no way are they able to do (that)"
  26,212,Surely they are indeed kept apart from hearing
  26,213,"So do not invoke another god with Allah, then you should be of the tormented"
  26,214,"And warn your kinsmen, the nearest kin"
  26,215,And lower your wing to the ones who closely follow you of the believers
  26,216,"Yet, in case they disobey you, then say, \"Surely I am quit of whatever you do"
  26,217,"And put your trust in The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Merciful"
  26,218,Who sees you while you rise (in prayer)
  26,219,And (Ever) your turning about among the prostrate
  26,220,"Surely He, Ever He, is The Ever-Hearing, The Ever-Knowing"
  26,221,Shall I (fully) inform you on whom Ash-Shayatin keep coming down
  26,222,They keep coming down on every most vicious (and) constant falsifier
  26,223,"They are eager on hearing, and most of them are liars"
  26,224,"And the poets, the misguided closely follow them"
  26,225,Have you not seen that they wander in every valley
  26,226,And that they say what they do not perform
  26,227,"Excepting the ones who have believed, and done deeds of righteousness, and remember Allah much, and vindicate themselves ever after being unjustly treated. And soon the ones who did injustice will know by whatever overturning they will be overturned"
