quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,26,"To the ones who are fair-doers is the fairest reward and an increase; (i.e., a surplus) (and) neither gloom (Literally: grudging circumstances) nor humiliation will oppress their faces; those are the companions (i.e., inhabitants) of the Garden; they are therein eternally (abiding)"
  10,27,"And for the ones who have earned odious deeds, the recompense of a bad deed will be the like of it, and humiliation shall oppress them. In no way will they have a safeguard from Allah, as if their faces are enveloped with strips of darkest night. Those are the companions (i.e., inhabitants) of the Fire; they are therein eternally (abiding)"
  10,28,"And the Day We will muster them altogether, thereafter we say to the ones who associated (other gods with Allah), \"To your place, you and your associates!\" Then We will distinguish between them, and the associates will say, (i.e., to the associators) \"In no way did you worship us"
  10,29,So Allah suffices as Ever-Witnessing between us and you; decidedly we were indeed heedless of your worship
  10,30,"Thereover every self will try (i.e., see the consequences of) whatever it (did) in bygone days and they will be turned back to Allah, the Supreme Patronizer, The True, and there will err (Or: stray; i.e., their fabricated gods will leave them) away from them whatever they were fabricating"
  10,31,"Say, \"Who provides you from the heaven and the earth, or even who possesses hearing and beholdings, (i.e., eyesights) and who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living, and who conducts the Command?\" Then will they soon say, \" Allah.\" So say, \"Then will you not be pious"
  10,32,"That then is Allah, your Lord, The True; so what is there, after the Truth, except error? Then wherever are you turned about"
  10,33,Thus the Word of your Lord has come true against the ones who were immoral that they do not believe
