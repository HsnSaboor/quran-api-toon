quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  3,122,"(Remember) as two sections of you were about to be disheartened, and Allah is their Ever- Patronizing Patron; and on Allah let the believers then put their trust"
  3,123,"And indeed Allah readily granted you victory at Badr, and you were humble; so be pious to Allah, that possibly you would thank (Him)"
  3,124,"As you said to the believers, \"Is it never sufficient for you that your Lord should supply you with three thousand of the Angels sent down (upon you)"
  3,125,"Yes indeed, in case you are patient and pious, and (the enemy) comes up (against) you instantly, (Literally: this instant of theirs) your Lord will supply you with five thousand of the Angels, markedly swooping"
  3,126,"And in no way has Allah made (this supply) except as good tidings to you and that thereby your hearts may be composed; and in no way does victory (come) except from the Providence of Allah, The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Wise"
  3,127,"That He may cut off a fringe of the ones who have disbelieved or suppress them, so they would turn over disappointed"
  3,128,"You have nothing to do concerning the Command, (i.e. My Command) whether He relents towards them or torments them, as surely they are unjust"
  3,129,"And to Allah (belongs) whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. He forgives whomever He decides and torments whomever He decides; and Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
  3,130,"O you who have believed, do not eat riba, (i.e., usury; interest and other unlawful gains) doubled (and) redoubled, and be pious to Allah that possibly you would prosper"
  3,131,And protect yourselves from the Fire that is prepared for the disbelievers
  3,132,And obey Allah and the Messenger that possibly you would be granted mercy
