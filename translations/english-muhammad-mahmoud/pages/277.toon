quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  16,88,"The ones who have disbelieved and barred from the way of Allah, We will increase for them torment above the torment, for that they were corrupting (in the earth)"
  16,89,"And the Day We will make to rise again in every nation a witness against them from among themselves, and We will cause you (The prophet) to come as a witness against these. And We have been sending down on you the Book as an evident (exposition) of everything, and as a guidance, and a mercy, and as good tidings to Muslims (i.e., those who surrender to Allah)"
  16,90,"Surely Allah commands to justice and fairness and bringing (charity) to a near kinsman, and He forbids obscenity and maleficence and iniquity. He admonishes you that possibly you would be mindful"
  16,91,"And fulfil the covenant of Allah when you have covenanted, and do not break the oaths after they have been affirmed. And you have already made Allah Sponsor over you; surely Allah knows whatever (things) you perform"
  16,92,"And do not be as she who breaks her yarn, even after it is strongly spun, (Literally: powerfully spun) into strands, by taking to yourselves your oaths fraudulently among yourselves, one nation being more numerous than another nation. Surely, Allah only tries you thereby; and indeed He will definitely make evident to you upon the Day of the Resurrection that wherein you used to differ"
  16,93,"And if Allah had (so) decided, indeed He would have made you one nation; but He leads into error whomever He decides to, and He guides whomever He decides to; and indeed you will definitely be questioned about whatever you were doing"
