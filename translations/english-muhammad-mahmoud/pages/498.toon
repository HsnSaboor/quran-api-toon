  44,42,"Except him on whom Allah has mercy; surely He, Ever He, is The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Merciful"
  44,43,Surely the Tree of Az-Zaqqum
  44,44,Is the food of the constantly vicious
  44,45,"Like molten metal, it boils in the bellies"
  44,46,As the boiling of scalding water
  44,47,"Take him, then thrust him into the (deepest) level of Hell-Fire"
  44,48,Thereafter pour above his head of the torment of scalding (water)
  44,49,"Taste! Surely you, (only) you are (i.e., you used to think that you were mighty) the constantly mighty, the constantly honorable"

  44,51,Surely the pious will be in a station constantly secure
  44,52,In Gardens and Springs
  44,53,"Wearing (garments) of serenest and brocade, facing one another"
  44,54,Thus (it will be); and We will espouse them to wide-eyed h?r (Fair females in paradise)
  44,55,"Therein (they will be) calling for every (kind) of fruit, secure"
  44,56,"They will not taste therein of death, except the first death, and He will protect them from the torment of Hell-Fire"
