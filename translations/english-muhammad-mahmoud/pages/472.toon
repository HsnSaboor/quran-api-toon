  40,42,"You call me to disbelieve in Allah and to associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, and I call you to The Ever-Mighty, The Superb Forgiver"
  40,43,"(There is) no question that what you call me to has no call (heard) in the present (life) (Literally: lowly life, i.e., the life of this world) or in the Hereafter, and that our turning back is to Allah, and that the extravagant are the ones who are the companions (i.e., inhabitants) of the Fire"
  40,44,"Then you will soon remember what I say to you; and I confide my Command (Or: my affair) to Allah. Surely Allah is Ever-Beholding (His) bondmen"
  40,45,"So Allah protected him against the odious (things) of their scheming, and an odious torment redounded on the house of Firaawn: (Pharaoh)"
  40,46,"The Fire. They will be set before it in the early morning and at nightfall, and on the Day when the Hour (comes) up, \"Make the house of Firaawn (Pharaoh) to enter into the strictest torment"

  40,49,"And the ones who are in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell, \"Invoke your Lord to lighten for us one day of the torment"
