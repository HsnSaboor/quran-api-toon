quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,Not at all! Surely the Book of the constantly impious is indeed in Sijjin
  83,8,And what makes you realize what Sijjin is
  83,9,(It is) a Book imprinted
  83,10,Woe upon that Day to the beliers
  83,11,Who cry lies to the Day of Doom
  83,12,And in no way does anyone cry lies to it except every constantly vicious transgressor
  83,13,"When Our ayat (Verses, signs) are recited to him, he says, \"Myths of the earliest (people)"
  83,14,"Not at all! No indeed, (but) whatever they were earning has overlaid on their hearts"
  83,15,Not at all! Surely upon that Day they will indeed be curtained from their Lord
  83,16,Thereafter surely they will indeed be roasting in Hell-Fire
  83,17,"Thereafter it will be said (to them), \"This is what you cried lies to"
  83,18,"Not at all! Surely the Book of the constantly-benign is indeed in cIlliyyin (i.e., the most exalted places)"
  83,19,And what makes you realize what cIlliyyin is
  83,20,(It is) a Book imprinted
  83,21,"The near-stationed (i.e., the Angels stationed near to Allah) witness it"
  83,22,Surely the constantly-benign will indeed be in Bliss
  83,23,On couches looking (about)
  83,24,You recognize in their faces the bloom of Bliss
  83,25,They will be given to drink of sealed nectar
  83,26,Whose sealing is musk; for this then let the competitors compete
  83,27,And whose blend is of Tasnim
  83,28,"A spring at which drink the near-stationed (i.e., the Angles stationed near Allah)"
  83,29,Surely the ones who are (guilty of) crimes used to laugh at the ones who believed
  83,30,And when they passed by them (they used) to wink one to another
  83,31,"And when they turned over (to their families), they turned over jesting"
  83,32,"And when they saw them, they said, \"Surely these (people) are indeed erring"
  83,33,And in no way were they sent preservers over them
  83,34,So Today the ones who believed are laughing at the steadfast disbelievers
