quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  24,28,"Then in case you do not find anyone therein, do not enter it until you are permitted (to do so). And in case it is said to you, \"Return, \" then return. It is more cleansing for you, and Allah is Ever-Knowing of whatever you do"
  24,29,"It is no fault in you that you enter undwelt (Literally: other than being dwelt) houses wherein are belongings for you; and Allah knows whatever you display and whatever you keep back"
  24,30,"Say to the (male) believers, that they cast down their be holdings, (i.e., \"modestly\" cast down their eyes) and preserve their private parts; that is more cleansing for them. Surely Allah is Ever-Cognizant of whatever they work out"
  24,31,"And say to the female believers to cast down their be holdings, and preserve their private parts, and not display their adornment except such as is outward, and let them fix (Literally: strike) closely their veils over their bosoms, and not display their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbands' fathers, or their sons, or their husbands' sons, or their brothers, or their brothers's sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or what their right hands possess, or (male) followers, men without desire (Literally: without being endowed with \"sexual\" desire) or young children who have not yet attained knowledge of women's privacies, and they should not strike their legs (i.e., stamp their feet) so that whatever adornment they hide may be known. And repent to Allah altogether, (O) you believers, that possibly you would prosper"
