quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,11,"Surely the ones who came with the falsehood are a band of you; do not reckon it evil for you; no indeed, it is charitable for you. Every person of them will have whatever vice he earned (charged) to him; and whoever of them took upon himself the greater part of it, he will have a tremendous torment"
  24,12,"If the men believers and the women believers had thought good (thoughts) of themselves as you heard it and they would have said, \"This is an evident falsehood"
  24,13,"If they had come up with four witnesses against it- yet as they did not come up with the witnesses, then those, in the Reckoning of Allah, are they (who are) the liars"
  24,14,"And had it not been for the Grace of Allah upon you and His mercy in the present (life) (Literally: the lowly \"life\", i.e., the life of this world) and the Hereafter, indeed a tremendous torment would have touched you for what you press on (i.e., for what you press on talking about falsehood)"
  24,15,"As you received it on your tongues and were saying with your mouths that of which you had no knowledge and reckoned it was a simple thing, and in the Reckoning of Allah it is a tremendous thing"
  24,16,"And if you had (but) said, as you heard it, \"In no way is it for us to talk about this. All Extolment be to You! This is a tremendous calumny"
  24,17,Allah admonishes you that you not go back to the like thereof at all in case you are believers
  24,18,"And Allah makes evident to you the signs, and Allah is Ever-Knowing, Ever-Wise"
  24,19,"Surely the ones who love that (the) obscenity should be widespread among the ones who have believed, (they) will have a painful torment in the present (life) (Literally: the lowly \"life\", i.e., the life of this world) and the Hereafter; and Allah knows, and you do not know"
  24,20,"And had it not been for the Grace of Allah upon you and His mercy, and that Allah is Ever-Compassionate, Ever-Merciful (you had been the losers)"
