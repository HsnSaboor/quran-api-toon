quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  48,16,"Say to the Arabs (of the desert) who were left behind, \"You will soon be called against a people endowed with strict violence to fight them, or they surrender. So, in case you obey, Allah will bring you a fair reward, and in case you turn away, as you did turn away earlier, He will torment you with a painful torment"
  48,17,"There is no objection (Literally: restring) on the blind, nor is there objection (Literally: restring) on the lame, nor is there objection on the sick (if they do not go out to fight). And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will cause him to enter Gardens from beneath which rivers run; and whoever turns away, He will torment him with a painful torment"
  48,18,"Indeed Allah has already been satisfied with the believers as they were swearing allegiance to you beneath the tree. So He knew what was in their hearts, then He sent down serenity upon them, and requited them with a near conquest"
  48,19,"And much booty (The Arabic words are plural) for them to take; and Allah has been Ever-Mighty, Ever-Wise"
  48,20,"Allah has promised you much booty (The Arabic words are plural) to take; so He has (quickly) hastened it to you, and has restrained the hands of mankind from you, and that it may be a sign to the believers, and to guide you on a straight Path"
  48,21,"And other (booty) which you were not able to (take), Allah has encompassed it already; and Allah has been Ever-Determiner over everything"
  48,22,"And if the ones who have disbelieved fought you, indeed they would have turned their backs; thereafter they will find neither a patron nor a ready vindicator"
  48,23,"The enactment of Allah, which has already passed away earlier, and you will never find any exchange (s) to the enactment of Allah"
