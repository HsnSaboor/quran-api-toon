quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,77,And do they not know that Allah knows whatever they keep secret and whatever they make public
  2,78,"And among them are illiterates (who) do not know the Book except (only) fancies, and decidedly they do (nothing) except surmise"
  2,79,"So woe to (the ones) who write the Book with their hands; thereafter they say, \"This is from (the Providence of) Allah, that they may trade it for a little price; So, woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they have earned"
  2,80,"And they have said, \"The Fire will never touch us except a (few) numbered days.\" Say, \"Have you taken to yourselves in the Providence of Allah a Covenant? So Allah will never fail in His Covenant, or do you say against Allah that which you do not know"
  2,81,"Yes indeed, whoever has earned an odious deed and his offense(s) have encompassed him, then those are therein the companions ( (i.e. inhabitants) of the Fire; they are therein eternally (abiding)"
  2,82,"And the ones who have believed and done deeds of righteousness, those are the companions of the Garden; they are therein eternally (abiding)"
  2,83,"And (remember) as We took Compact with the Seeds (or: sons)of Israel) (that), \"You shall not worship any (god) except Allah, and (show) fairest companionship to parents, and near kinsmen, and to orphans, and to the indigent; and speak fair to mankind, and keep up the prayer, and bring the Zakat. (i.e., pay the obligatory poor-dues)\" (But) thereafter you turned away excepting for a few of you, and you are (still) veering away"
