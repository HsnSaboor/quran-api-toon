quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Did We not create you of a contemptible water
  77,21,Then We made it in an established reposing
  77,22,Till a known (term) determined
  77,23,So We determined; so Excellent the Determiners are We
  77,24,Upon that Day woe to the beliers
  77,25,Have We not made the earth a receptacle
  77,26,For the living and the dead
  77,27,"And We made therein lofty anchorages, (i.e., mountains) and We made you to drink water grateful (to taste)"
  77,28,Upon that Day woe to the beliers
  77,29,Go off to what you used to cry as lies
  77,30,"Go off to a three-pronged (Literally: comprising three prongs) shade"
  77,31,With no plenteous shade and of no avail against the flames
  77,32,"Surely it throws up sparks like palace (s) (Or: dry faggots)"
  77,33,"As if they were yellow (heaps) of cables (Or: golden herds)"
  77,34,Upon that Day woe to the beliers
  77,35,This is the Day they will not pronounce (a word)
  77,36,"Nor be permitted to, then excuse themselves"
  77,37,Upon that Day woe to the beliers
  77,38,"This is the Day of Verdict: We have gathered you and the earliest (people)"
  77,39,"So, if (ever) you have any plotting, then plot against Me"
  77,40,Upon that Day woe to the beliers
  77,41,Surely the pious will be in shades and springs
  77,42,And such fruits as they crave
  77,43,"Eat and drink, rejoicing with wholesome appetite, for whatever you were doing"
  77,44,Thus surely We recompense the fair-doers
  77,45,Upon that Day woe to the beliers
  77,46,"Eat and enjoy (your life) a little: surely you are criminals"
  77,47,Upon that Day woe to the beliers
  77,48,"And when it is said to them, \"Bow down!\" They do not bow down"
  77,49,Upon that Day woe to the beliers
  77,50,"So, in whichever discourse after (this) do they believe"
