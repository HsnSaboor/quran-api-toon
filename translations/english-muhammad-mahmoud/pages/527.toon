quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,Surely the ones who do not believe in the Hereafter do indeed name the Angels with female naming
  53,28,"And in no way do they have any knowledge thereof. Decidedly they closely follow (nothing) except surmise, and surely surmise does not avail anything against the Truth"
  53,29,"So veer away from him who turns back from Our Remembrance and is not willing (to seek anything) except the present life (Literally: the lowly life, i.e., the life of this world)"
  53,30,"That is their attainment of knowledge. Surely your Lord is He Who knows best the ones who have erred away from His way, and He knows best the ones who are guided"
  53,31,And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth that He may recompense the ones who have done odious (deeds) for what they have done and recompense the ones who have done fair (deeds) with the fairest reward
  53,32,"The ones who avoid the great (kinds) of vice and obscenities, except lesser offences; surely your Lord is Ever-Embracing in (His) forgiveness. He knows you best, as He brought you into being from the earth, and as you were embryos in your mothers' bellies; so do not (consider) yourselves cleansed; (only) He knows best him who is pious"
  53,33,Have you (The Prophet) then seen him who turns away
  53,34,And gives little and (then) parsimoniously
  53,35,"Does he have in his presence the knowledge of the Unseen, so he sees"
  53,36,Or even has he not been fully informed of what is in the Scrolls of Musa (Moses)
  53,37,"And Ibrahim, (Abraham) who constantly fulfilled the Message"
  53,38,That no encumbered self will be encumbered with the encumbrance of another
  53,39,And that man will have nothing except that for which he has endeavored (to achieve)
  53,40,And that his endeavor will eventually be seen
  53,41,(And) thereafter he will be recompensed for it with the fullest recompense
  53,42,"And that to your Lord is the final (End); (Or: judgment; recompense)"
  53,43,"And that He, Ever He, makes to laugh, and He makes to weep"
  53,44,"And that He Ever He, makes to die, and He makes to live"
