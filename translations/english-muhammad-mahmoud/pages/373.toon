quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,137,Decidedly this is nothing except the character of the earliest (people)
  26,138,And in no way will we be tormented
  26,139,"So they cried him lies, then We caused them to perish. Surely in that is indeed a sign; and in no way were most of them believers"
  26,140,"And surely your Lord, He is indeed The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Merciful"
  26,141,Thamud cried lies to the Emissaries
  26,142,"As their brother Salih said to them, \"Will you not be pious"
  26,143,Surely I am for you a trustworthy Messenger
  26,144,"So be pious to Allah, and obey me"
  26,145,And in no way do I ask of you any reward for (this); decidedly my reward (falls) upon no one except The Lord of the worlds
  26,146,Will you be left secure in what you have here now
  26,147,In gardens and springs
  26,148,"And plantations, and palm trees with spathes slender (and) digestible? (Or: heavy spthes)"
  26,149,And you (skillfully) hew houses out of the mountains
  26,150,"So be pious to Allah, and obey me"
  26,151,And do not obey the command of the extravagant
  26,152,"Who corrupt in the earth, and do not act righteously"
  26,153,"They said, \"Surely you are only one of the utterly bewitched"
  26,154,"In no way are you (anything) except a mortal, like us. Then come up with a sign, in case you are one of the sincere"
  26,155,"He said, \"This is a she-camel. To her is a (time of) drinking and to you (another time of) drinking, on a known day"
  26,156,And do not touch her with an odious (treatment) so that there takes you (away) the torment of a Tremendous Day
  26,157,"Yet they hamstrung her, (and) so they became remorseful"
  26,158,"Then the torment took them (away). Surely in that is indeed a sign, and in no way were most of them believers"
  26,159,"And surely your Lord, He is indeed The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Merciful"
