quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  15,1,"Alif, Lam, Mim, Ra (These are the names of letters of the Arabic alphabet, and only Allah knows their meaning here). Those are the ayat (Verses, signs) of the Book and an Evident Qur'an"
  15,2,(Probably) the ones who have disbelieved would often rather like that if they were Muslims
  15,3,"Leave them out to eat and enjoy (life), and let (false) aspiration divert them; then eventually they will know"
  15,4,And in no way did We cause any town to perish except that it had a known (prescribed) Book
  15,5,"In no way can any nation outstrip its term, and in no way will they (be able) to postpone it"
  15,6,"And they said, \"O you upon whom the Remembrance is being sent down, surely you are indeed a madman"
  15,7,"Would you ever come up with the Angels to us, in case you are of the sincere"
  15,8,"In no way do We send down the Angels except with the Truth; and lo, in no way would they (The disbelievers) be respited"
  15,9,"Surely We, Ever We, have been sending down the Remembrance, and surely We are indeed Preservers of it"
  15,10,And indeed We sent (Messengers) even before you among the sects of the earliest (people)
  15,11,And in no way did a Messenger come up to them except that they used to mock at him
  15,12,Thus We insert it (Disbelief) into the hearts of the criminals
  15,13,They do not believe in it; (The Message) and the enactment (The reward for good and evil) (for) the earliest (people) has already passed away
  15,14,And (even) if We opened upon them a gate of the heaven (and) so they linger on winding up through it
  15,15,"They would indeed say, \"Surely it is only that our be holdings (i.e., eyesights) are stupefied; no indeed, we are a people bewitched"
