  20,100,"Whoever veers away from it, then surely upon the Day of the Resurrection he will carry an encumbrance"
  20,101,Eternally (abiding) therein; and (how) odious for them upon the Day of the Resurrection is it as a burden
  20,102,"The Day the Trumpet will be blown, and We will muster the criminals upon that day blue (with terror)"
  20,103,"(Speaking) among themselves in a hushed voice, \"Decidedly you lingered (nothing) except ten (days)"
  20,104,"We know best what they say, as the most exemplary of them in (their) mode (of life) say, \"Decidedly you have lingered (nothing) except a day"
  20,105,"And they ask you about the mountains. Then say, \"My Lord will crush them into powder (Literally: crush them \"an utter\" crushing)"
  20,106,So He will leave them behind as a desolate spacious plain
  20,107,Wherein you will see no crookedness nor any curving
  20,108,"Upon that Day, they will closely follow the caller in whom is no crookedness; and voices will submit to The All-Merciful so that you hear nothing except a (faint) muttering"
  20,109,"Upon that Day (the) intercession will not profit, except for him whom The All-Merciful has given permission, and with whose speech He is satisfied"
  20,110,"He knows whatever is before (Literally: between their hands) them, and whatever is behind them, and they do not encompass Him in knowledge"
  20,111,"And faces will be subservient to The Ever Living, The Superb Upright Sustainer, (Or: The Most Upright) and he who bears (a burden of) injustice is already disappointed"
  20,112,"And whoever does deeds of righteousness and he is a believer, then he will fear neither injustice nor forfeiture"
  20,113,"And thus We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur'an, and We have propounded in it (something) of threats, that possibly they would be pious or it would effect in them remembrance"
