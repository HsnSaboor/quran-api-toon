quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"So, have you seen (him) who has disbelieved in Our signs and said, \"Indeed I will definitely be brought wealth and children"
  19,78,Has he viewed the Unseen or taken to himself a covenant from the Providence of The All-Merciful
  19,79,"Not at all! We will soon write down whatever he says, and We will grant him an extension (Literally: extend him an extension) of torment"
  19,80,"And We will inherit from him whatever he says, and he will come up to Us a single (person)"
  19,81,"And they have taken to themselves (other) gods apart from Allah, that they would be for them a might (i.e. that gods would make mighty)"
  19,82,Not at all! They will soon disbelieve in their worship of them and will be opponents against them
  19,83,"Have you not seen that We sent Ash-Shayatin (The ever-vicious ones, i.e., the devils) against the disbelievers, alluring them by (every manner of) allurement"
  19,84,So do not hasten against them; surely We are only numbering for them a number (of days)
  19,85,On the Day We will muster the pious to The All-Merciful as a (welcome) deputation
  19,86,"And drive the criminals into Hell, (a thirsty) herd"
  19,87,"They do not possess (any means of) intercession, except the ones who have taken to him from the Providence of the All-Merciful a covenant"
  19,88,"And they have said, \"The All-Merciful has taken to Him a child"
  19,89,Indeed you have already come with a hideous thing
  19,90,"The heavens are almost about to be rent asunder thereof, and the earth cloven and the mountains to collapse, razed (completely)"
  19,91,For that they have attributed to The All-Merciful a child
  19,92,And in no way does it behoove The All-Merciful to take to Him a child
  19,93,"Decidedly none is there (Literally: all that are there) in the heavens and the earth except that he comes up to The All-Merciful as a slave"
  19,94,"Indeed He has already enumerated them, and He has numbered them with (exact) numbering"
  19,95,"And all of them will be coming up to Him upon the Day of the Resurrection, every one singly"
