quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  30,42,"Say, \"Travel in the earth, then look into how was the end of the ones who were earlier; most of them were associators.\" (Those who associate others with Allah)"
  30,43,So set your face upright to the most upright religion even before there comes up from Allah a Day without turning (back); upon that Day they will be sundered apart
  30,44,"Whoever disbelieves, then his disbelief will be (charged) against him; and whoever does righteousness, then for themselves they are gaining access (to the Garden)"
  30,45,That He may recompense the ones who have believed and done righteous deeds of His Grace; surely He does not love the disbelievers
  30,46,"And of His signs is that He sends the winds, (constantly bearing) good tidings and that He may let you taste of His mercy, and that the ships may run by His Command, and that you may seek (your share of) His Grace; and that possibly you would thank (Him)"
  30,47,And indeed We sent even before you Messengers to their people; then they came to them with the supreme evidence. So We took vengeance upon (those) who (committed) crimes; and it is truly (binding) on Us to (give) victory to the believers
  30,48,"Allah is He Who sends the winds. So they stir up clouds, then He outspreads them in the heaven how He decides and makes them into lumps. Then you see rain-drops coming (Literally: going out) out of the midst of them. So when He makes it alight on whomever of His bondmen He decides; only then they are glad at the tidings"
  30,49,"And decidedly before that, before it was sent down on them, they had been indeed dumbfounded"
  30,50,"So look into the tracks of the mercy of Allah, how He gives life to the earth after its death; surely He (Literally: That) is indeed the Life-Giver of the dead, and He is Ever-Determiner over everything"
