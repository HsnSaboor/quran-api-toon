quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,(There) go round them eternalized young men
  56,18,"With goblets, and beakers, and a cup from a profuse spring"
  56,19,"Wherefrom their (heads) will not ache, nor will they feel exhausted"
  56,20,And (such) fruits as they will freely choose
  56,21,And such flesh of birds as they crave for
  56,22,And wide-eyed huris
  56,23,As the likeness of nestled pearls
  56,24,(This is) a recompense for whatever they were doing
  56,25,"Therein they will not hear any idle talk, nor any cause for vice"
  56,26,"Except the blissful saying, \"Peace! Peace"
  56,27,And the companions of the Right; what (will become) of the companions of the Right
  56,28,They will be among thornless lote-trees
  56,29,"And Talh, (It may mean banana or acacia, which are compacted) tiered (one on another)"
  56,30,And extended shade
  56,31,And outpoured water
  56,32,And many (kinds) of fruit
  56,33,"Neither out of season, (Literally: cut off) nor out of reach- (i.e., unending fruits, that are not forbidden)"
  56,34,And raised beddings
  56,35,Surely We have brought them (The huris) into being a (perfect) bringing up
  56,36,So We have made them virgins
  56,37,"Chastely amorous, like of age"
  56,38,For the companions of the Right
  56,39,A throng of the earliest (people)
  56,40,And a throng of the later (people)
  56,41,"And the companions of the Left, what (will become) of the companions of the Left"
  56,42,"(They will be) in pestilential wind, and scalding water"
  56,43,And the shade of a Smoking Blaze
  56,44,"Neither cool, nor refreshing (Literally: honorable)"
  56,45,Surely they were before that (living) in ease and luxury
  56,46,And they used to persist in the monstrous vileness
  56,47,"And they used to say, \"When we die and are dust and bones, will we surely be made to rise again"
  56,48,And (also) our earliest fathers
  56,49,"Say, (This is addressed to the Prophet) \"Surely the earliest people and the later"
  56,50,Will indeed be gathered to the fixed time of a known Day
