quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,"For the (customary) accord (Or: joining together) of Quraysh"
  106,2,Their (customary) accord for the winter and summer caravan
  106,3,So let them worship The Lord of this House
  106,4,Who has fed them against hunger and secured them from fear
  107,1,Have you seen him who cries lies to the Doom
  107,2,That is the one who repulses the orphan
  107,3,And does not urge the (offering) of food to the indigent
  107,4,So woe to the ones who pray
  107,5,Who are they that are unmindful of their prayer
  107,6,Who are they that show off
  107,7,And (refuse and) prevent (small) kindnesses
  108,1,Surely We have given you the Abundance
  108,2,So pray to your Lord and slaughter (the sacrifice)
  108,3,"Surely your antagonist is he who is without offspring (Literally: curtailed)"
