quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  27,64,"Is not He (Most Charitable) Who begins creation, (and) thereafter He brings it back again, and Who provides you from the heaven and the earth? Is there a god with Allah? Say, \"Offer your proof, in case you are sincere"
  27,65,"Say, \"None knows the Unseen in the heavens and the earth except Allah.\" And in no way are they aware whence they will be made to rise again"
  27,66,"No indeed, (but) their knowledge has been overtaken (i.e., their knowledge is insignificant) as to the Hereafter; no indeed, they are in doubt of it; no indeed, they are willfully blind to it"
  27,67,"And the ones who have disbelieved have said, \"When we are dust, and our fathers, surely will we indeed be brought out (of the graves)"
  27,68,"Indeed, we have already been promised this, we and our fathers earlier. Decidedly this is (nothing) except myths of the earliest (people)"
  27,69,"Say, \"Travel in the earth, then look into how was the end of the criminals"
  27,70,And do not grieve for them nor be straitened for what they scheme
  27,71,"And they say, \"When will this promise (come to pass), in case you are sincere"
  27,72,"Say, \"It may be that coming immediately after you is some (part) of that which you seek to hasten"
  27,73,And surely your Lord is indeed The Owner of Grace to mankind; but most of them do not thank (Him)
  27,74,And surely your Lord knows indeed whatever their breasts carefully secrete and whatever they make public
  27,75,And in no way is there an unseen thing in the heaven or the earth except that it is in an evident Book
  27,76,"Surely this Qur'an an narrates to the Seeds (Or: sons) of Israel most of that concerning which they differ"
