quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  7,131,"Then when the fair (reward) came to them, they said, \"This belongs to us, \" and in case an odious (thing) afflicted them, they would augur ill by Musa (Moses) and the ones with him. Verily their bird (of augury) is surely only in the Meeting with Allah, but most of them did not know"
  7,132,"And they said, \"No matter what sign you come up with to us to bewitch us, then in no way are we believers with you"
  7,133,"So We sent upon them the deluge, and the locusts, and the lice, and the frogs, and the blood, expounded signs; yet they waxed proud and were a criminal people"
  7,134,"And as soon as the chastisement befell them, they said, \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us by what He covenanted in your presence. Indeed in case you lift off from us the chastisement, indeed we will definitely believe you, and indeed we will definitely send with you the Seeds (Or: sons) of .\"Israel"
  7,135,"Then as soon as We lifted off from them the chastisement to a term that they should reach, only then did they breach (their covenant)"
  7,136,"So We took vengeance on them, then We drowned them in the main for that they cried lies to Our signs, and they were heedless of them"
  7,137,"And We caused the people that were deemed weak to inherit the eastern parts of the earth and the western parts, which We had blessed, and the Fairest Word of your Lord was perfectly (fulfilled) upon the Seeds of for whatever they (endured) patiently; and We destroyed whatever Firaawn (pharaoh) used to work, (i.e., make) and his people, and what they used to trellis. (Literally: to trellis. Understood here to mean build as thrones, palaces and towers)"
