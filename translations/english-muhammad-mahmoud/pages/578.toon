quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,"Not at all! No indeed, (but) you (i.e., mankind) love the hasty (world)"
  75,21,And leave behind the Hereafter
  75,22,Faces upon that Day will be blooming
  75,23,Looking towards their Lord
  75,24,And faces upon that Day shall be scowling
  75,25,Expecting that a (back-breaking) calamity is going to be performed upon them
  75,26,Not at all! When it reaches the clavicles
  75,27,"And it is said, \"Who is an enchanter"
  75,28,And he expects that it is the parting
  75,29,And shank is entwined with shank
  75,30,To your Lord upon that Day will be the driving
  75,31,So he neither sincerely (believed) nor prayed
  75,32,"But he cried lies, and turned away"
  75,33,Thereafter he went to his family striding haughtily
  75,34,"(It is) more appropriate to you, then more appropriate! (i.e., punishment)"
  75,35,"Thereafter (it is) more appropriate for you, then more appropriate"
  75,36,Does man reckon that he will be left in vain
  75,37,Was he not a spermdrop ejaculated
  75,38,"Thereafter he was a clot (i.e., a leach-like clot). So He created, then He molded"
  75,39,"So He made him of two spouses, the male and the female"
  75,40,"Is He (Literally: That) not (always) Determiner over giving life to the dead"
  76,1,Has there come upon man a while of (an) era when he was not a thing to be remembered
  76,2,"Surely We created man from a sperm-drop, a mingling, trying him; so We made him constantly hearing, constantly beholding"
  76,3,"Surely We have guided him upon the way, whether he be thankful or most disbelieving"
  76,4,Surely We have readied for the disbelievers chains and shackles and a Blaze
  76,5,Surely the benign will drink of a cup whose blend is camphor
