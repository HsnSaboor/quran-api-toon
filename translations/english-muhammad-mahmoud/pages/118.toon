quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,58,"And when you call out to prayer, they take it to themselves in mockery and as a plaything; that is they are a people who do not consider"
  5,59,"Say, (i.e. the prophet) \"O you Population of the Book, (Or: Family of the Book; i.e., the Jews and Christians) do you take vengeance on us (for anything) except that we have believed in Allah, and what has been sent down to us, and what was sent down earlier, and that most of you are immoral"
  5,60,"Say (i.e. the prophet) \"Shall I (fully) inform you of a requiting in the Meeting with Allah eviler than that? Whomever Allah has cursed and with whom He is angry and made (some) of them apes and swine, and worshipers of the Taghut, (i.e. idols, and anything worshiped besides Allah) those are in eviler place and have erred further away from the level way"
  5,61,"And when they come to you, (i.e. the believers. The pronoun is plural) they say, \"We believe.\" And they have already entered with disbelief, and they have already gone out with it; and Allah knows best whatever they used to keep back"
  5,62,"And you (i.e., The prophet. The pronoun is singular) see many of them vie swiftly in vice and hostility and in their eating (up) of illicit gains; miserable indeed is whatever they used to do"
  5,63,If (only) the rabbis and the doctors (of the Law) had been forbidding them speaking vice and the eating (up) of illicit gains! Miserable indeed is whatever they used to work out
  5,64,"And the Jews have said, \"The Hand of Allah is shackled.\" Shackled are their hands, and they are cursed for what they have said. No indeed (but) both His Hands are out spread, He expends how He decides. And indeed what has been sent down to you from your Lord will definitely increase many of them in all-in ordinance and disbelief; and We have cast among them enmity and abhorrence till the Day of the Resurrection. Whenever they kindle fire for war, Allah will extinguish it. And they endeavor (diligently) in the earth doing corruption; and Allah does not like the corruptors"
