quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,Of what do they ask one another (questions)
  78,2,"Of the tremendous tidings, (The Arabic word is singular)"
  78,3,Concerning which they (continue) differing among themselves
  78,4,Not at all! They will soon know
  78,5,"Thereafter, not at all! They will soon know"
  78,6,"Have We not made the earth as a cradling, (Or: level lands)"
  78,7,And the mountains as bulwarks
  78,8,And We created you in pairs
  78,9,And We have made your sleep for repose
  78,10,And We have made the night for a garment
  78,11,And We have made the daytime for (earning) a livelihood
  78,12,And We have built above you seven strong (heavens)
  78,13,And We have made a glowing luminary
  78,14,"And We have sent down from the clouds (i.e., rain clouds) pressing forth water cascading"
  78,15,That We may bring out thereby grain and growth
  78,16,And gardens entwined
  78,17,Surely the Day of Verdict has been (set) as a fixed time
  78,18,The Day when the Trumpet will be blown; then you will come up in troops
  78,19,"And the heaven is opened, (and) so has become gates"
  78,20,"And the mountains are made to travel, (and) so have become a mirage"
  78,21,"Surely Hell has been observing, (i.e., in expectation of the criminals)"
  78,22,For the inordinate (as) a resorting
  78,23,Lingering therein for epochs
  78,24,They will not taste therein either coolness or any drink
  78,25,Except scalding water and (overflowing) pus
  78,26,An agreeable recompense
  78,27,Surely they did not hope for a reckoning
  78,28,And they cried lies to Our signs with constant cries (of lies)
  78,29,And everything We have enumerated in a Book
  78,30,So taste! We will never increase you in anything except in torment
