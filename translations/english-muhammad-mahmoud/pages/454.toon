quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,17,"(Endure) patiently what they say; and remember Our bondman Dawud (David) (a man) possessing prowess (Literally: hands). Surely he was a constant resorter (to Allah)"
  38,18,Surely to him We subjected the mountains with him to extol at nightfall and sunshine
  38,19,"And the birds, mustered all to him a constant resorter"
  38,20,"And We upheld his kingdom and brought him (the) Wisdom and decisive speech (Literally: the verdict, the address)"
  38,21,And has the tiding of the adversaries come up to you? As they scaled the chamber
  38,22,"As they entered upon Dawud; then he was alarmed of them. They said, \"Do not fear (anything); two adversaries we are. One of us has been inequitable to the other, (Literally: some of us against some \"others\") so judge between us with the truth, and do not act unjudiciously, and guide us to the level path"
  38,23,"Surely this my brother has ninety-nine ewes, and I have one ewe. So he said to me, ‘Let me be her sponsor’ and he got the better of me in speech.\" (Literally: was mightier in the address)"
  38,24,"He (Dawud) said, \"Indeed he has already done an injustice to you in asking for your ewe (in addition) to his ewes; and surely many intermixes are indeed inequitable one against the other, (Literally: some of them are unfair to some \"others\") except the ones who have believed and done deeds of righteousness, and how few they are!\" And Dawud surmised that We had only tempted (Or: tried) him; so he asked forgiveness of his Lord, and he collapsed bowing down and turned penitent. A prostration is to be performed here"
  38,25,"So We forgave him that, and surely he has in Our Providence proximity indeed and a fair resorting"
  38,26,"O Dawud, surely We have made you a succeeding (Literally: Caliph) (Messenger) in the earth, so judge among mankind with the truth, and do not ever follow prejudice that it may make you err from the way of Allah. Surely the ones who err from the way of Allah will have a strict torment for that they have forgotten the Day of Reckoning"
