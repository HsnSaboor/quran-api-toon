  42,16,"And the ones who argue concerning Allah, (i.e., about surrendering \" Islam\" to Allah) even after He has been responded to, their argument is rebutted in the Reckoning of their Lord, and anger will be upon them, and for them is a strict torment"
  42,17,"Allah is (He) Who has sent down the Book with the Truth, and (also) the Balance; and what makes you realize that possibly the Hour is near"
  42,18,"The ones who do not believe therein seek to hasten it; and the ones who have believed (feel) timorous about it, and they know that it is the Truth. Verily, the ones who wrangle about the Hour are surely in far error indeed"
  42,19,"Allah is Ever-Kind to His bondmen; He provides whomever He decides; and He is The Ever-Powerful, The Ever-Mighty"
  42,20,"Whoever is willing (to gain) the tillage of Hereafter, We will give him increase in his tillage; and whoever is willing to (gain) the tillage of the present (life), (Literally: the lowly \"life\", i.e., the life of this world) We will bring him of it, and in no way will he have in the Hereafter any assignment"
  42,21,"Or even do they have associates (with Allah) who have legislated for them as the religion that which Allah has not given permission? And had it not been for the Word of Verdict, indeed it would have been decreed between them, and surely the unjust will have a painful torment"
  42,22,"You see the unjust feeling timorous about what they have earned, and it is befalling them. And the ones who have believed and done deeds of righteousness are in the Meadows of the Gardens; whatever they decide on they will have in the Providence of their Lord. It is that which is the great Grace"
