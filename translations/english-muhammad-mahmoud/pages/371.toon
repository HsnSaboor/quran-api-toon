quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,And make for me a tongue of sincerity (Truthfulness) in the later (generations)
  26,85,And make me among the heirs of the Garden of Bliss
  26,86,And forgive my father; surely he is one of the erring
  26,87,And do not disgrace me the Day when they are made to rise (again)
  26,88,The Day when neither money nor sons will profit (anyone)
  26,89,Except for him who comes up to Allah with a sound heart
  26,90,And the Garden will be drawn forward for the pious
  26,91,And Hell Fire will be brought forth for the misguided
  26,92,"And it will be said to them, \"Where is that which you used to worship"
  26,93,Apart from Allah? Do they vindicate you or vindicate themselves
  26,94,"Then they will be pitched (headlong) into it, they and the misguided"
  26,95,"And the hosts ofIblis, all together"
  26,96,"They will say, (as) they stood therein, adversaries with each other"
  26,97,"By Allah, decidedly we were indeed in evident error"
  26,98,As we made you equal with The Lord of the worlds
  26,99,And in no way did anybody lead us into error except the criminals
  26,100,So (now) in no way do we have any intercessors
  26,101,Nor any intimate friend
  26,102,"So, if we had (a chance) to recur, (i.e., to live again) then we should be among the believers"
  26,103,Surely in that is indeed a sign; and in no way were most of them believers
  26,104,"And surely your Lord, He is indeed The Ever-Mighty, The Ever-Merciful"
  26,105,The people of Nuh (Noah) cried lies to the Emissaries
  26,106,"As their brother Nuh said to them, \"Will you not be pious"
  26,107,Surely I am for you a trustworthy Messenger
  26,108,"So be pious to Allah, and obey me"
  26,109,And in no way do I ask of you any reward for (this); decidedly my reward (falls) upon no one except The Lord of the worlds
  26,110,"So be pious to Allah, and obey me"
  26,111,"They said, \"should we believe you, and the most decrepit closely follow you"
