quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  18,5,"In no way do they have any knowledge of it, (they) nor their fathers. An odious (Literally: great) word it is, coming out (Literally: going out) of their mouths; decidedly they say nothing except a lie"
  18,6,"Yet, it may be that you will consume yourself of sorrow over their tracks (i.e., their tracks or footprints when they turn away) in case they do not believe in this discourse"
  18,7,Surely We have made whatever is on the earth for an adornment for it that We may try whichever of them is fairest in deeds
  18,8,And We will indeed make whatever is on it arid dry soil
  18,9,"Or even do you reckon that the Companions of the Cave and Ar-Raqim (It is the name of a leaden plate, on which were written the names of the seven sleepers) were among Our signs a wonder"
  18,10,"As the young men (Literally: the pages) took (their) abode in the cave, (and) so they said, \"Our Lord, bring us mercy from very close to You, and dispose for us rectitude in our Command.\" (i.e., in Your Command to us; our: in our affair)"
  18,11,Then We struck upon their ears for a (great) number of years in the cave
  18,12,Thereafter We made them to rise again that We might know whichever of the two parties would best enumerate the span they had lingered
  18,13,"We, Ever We, narrate to you their tidings with the truth. Surely they were young men who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance"
  18,14,"And We braced (Literally: tied upon their hearts) their hearts as they rose up and said, \"Our Lord is The Lord of the heavens and the earth; we will never invoke any god, apart from Him, for indeed, we had already spoken unjudiciously"
  18,15,"These our people have taken to themselves (other) gods apart from Him. Had they come up with a most evident all-binding authority concerning their belief in them? So, who is more unjust than he who fabricates against Allah a lie"
