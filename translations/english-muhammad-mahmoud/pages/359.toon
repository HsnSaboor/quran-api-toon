quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  24,62,"Surely they only are the believers who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and who, when they are with him upon a common Command, do not go away until they ask his permission. Surely the ones who ask your permission are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission for some affair of their own, then give permission to whom you decide of them, and ask for them the forgiveness of Allah; surely Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
  24,63,"Do not make the calling of the Messenger among yourselves like your calling of one another (Literally: some of you to some others). Allah already knows the ones of you who sneak away seeking shelter (i.e., to disobey him). So let the ones who fail (to obey) His Command beware that temptation may afflict them or painful torment may afflict them"
  24,64,"Verily, to Allah surely belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. He already knows what (state) you are in (Literally: upon). And the Day they will be returned to Him, then He will fully inform them of whatever they did; and Allah is Ever-Knowing of everything"
  25,1,Supremely Blessed is He Who has sent down the all-distinctive Criterion upon His bondman that he may be a warner to the worlds
  25,2,"To Whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and He has not taken to Him a child, and He has no associate in the Kingdom; and He created everything, so He has determined it an (exact) determination"
