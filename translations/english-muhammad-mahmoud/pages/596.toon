quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,Whereat none except the most wretched will be roasted
  92,16,(He) who cried lies and turned away
  92,17,And which the most pious will soon be made to avoid
  92,18,(He) who brings (forth) his wealth to cleanse himself
  92,19,And in no way has anyone in his presence any favor to be recompensed
  92,20,"Except for seeking the Face of his Lord, The Most Exalted"
  92,21,And indeed he will eventually be satisfied
  93,1,And (by) the forenoon
  93,2,And (by) the night when it (comes) with its dark stillness
  93,3,"In no way has your Lord disregarded you, and in no way has He disfavored you"
  93,4,"And indeed the Hereafter will be more charitable (i.e., better) for you than the First (i.e., the present life)"
  93,5,And indeed your Lord will eventually give you so that you will be satisfied
  93,6,"Did He not find you an orphan, so He gave (you) an abode"
  93,7,"And He found you erring, so He guided (you)"
  93,8,"And He found you in want, so He enriched (you)"
  93,9,"Then, as for the orphan, then do not subdue (him)"
  93,10,"And as for the beggar, then do not scold (him)"
  93,11,"And as for your Lord's favor, then discourse about it! (i.e., proclaim it)"
  94,1,Have We not expanded your breast for you
  94,2,And laid aside from you your encumbrance
  94,3,Which weighed down your back
  94,4,And did We not raise for you your remembrance
  94,5,So surely with difficulty comes ease
  94,6,Surely with difficulty comes ease
  94,7,"So when you are at leisure, (i.e., not o) then labor"
  94,8,"And to your Lord then be desirous (i.e., of His Grace)"
