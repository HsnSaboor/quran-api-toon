quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  2,154,"And do not say of whomever are killed in the way of Allah, \" (They are) dead.\" No indeed, they are alive but you are not aware"
  2,155,"And indeed We will definitely try you with something of fear and hunger, and diminution of riches, and selves, and products; and give glad tidings to the patient"
  2,156,"Who, when an affliction afflicts them, say, \"Surely we belong to Allah, and surely to Him we are returning"
  2,157,"Upon those are the prayers from their Lord, and mercy; and those are they (who) are the right-guided"
  2,158,"Surely, As-safa and Al-Marwah (i.e. two hills near the Kacbah) are among the way marks of Allah. So whoever makes the Pilgrimage (i.e. Hajj) to the Home, or makes the Visitation, (cUmrah, sometimes called the minor pilgrimage) then there is no fault in him to circumambulate them; and whoever volunteers any (optional) charity, then surely Allah is Thankful, Ever-Knowing"
  2,159,"Surely (the ones) who keep back whatever supreme evidences and guidance We have sent down even after We have made them evident to mankind in the Book, Allah curses those (people), and the cursers (also) curse them"
  2,160,"Except (the ones) who repent and act righteously and ascertain the evidence; then, to those I relent, and I am The Superbly Relenting, The Ever-Merciful"
  2,161,"Surely (the ones) who have disbelieved and die (while) they are steadfast disbelievers, upon those is the curse of Allah and the Angels and mankind all together"
  2,162,"Eternally (abiding) therein, the torment will not be lightened for them, and they will not be respited"
  2,163,"And your God is One God; there is no god except He, The All-Merciful, The Ever-Merciful"
