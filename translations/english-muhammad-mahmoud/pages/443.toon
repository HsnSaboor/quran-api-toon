quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,And a sign for them is that We carried their offspring in the laden ship (s)
  36,42,And We created for them the like of it whereon they ride
  36,43,"And in case We (so) decide, We drown them; then they will have no screaming, nor are they rescued"
  36,44,Except as a mercy from Us and enjoyment for a while
  36,45,"And when it is said to them, \"Be pious as regards what is before you (Literally: between your hands) and what is behind you, that possibly you would be granted mercy"
  36,46,"And in no way does any sign of the signs of their Lord come up to them, except that they were veering away from it"
  36,47,"And when it is said to them, \"Expend of what Allah has provided you, \" the ones who have disbelieved have said to the ones who have believed, \"Shall we feed the ones whom, if Allah decides, He will feed? Decidedly you are in nothing except evident error"
  36,48,"And they say, \"When will this promise be, in case you are sincere"
  36,49,In no way are they awaiting anything except one Shout to take them (away) as they are in constant adversaries
  36,50,"Then they will not be able to make any testament, nor will they return to their families"
  36,51,"And the Trumpet is blown; then, only then, are they pressing down from the graves to their Lord"
  36,52,"They will say, \"oh woe to us! Who has made us rise again from our sleeping- place?\" (Literally: tying-place) \"This is what The All-Merciful promised, and the Emissaries (have spoken) sincerely"
  36,53,"Decidedly it was only one Shout; then, only then, will they together be closely presented to Us"
  36,54,"So today no self will be unjustly (treated) in anything, and you will not be recompensed, except (for) whatever you were doing"
