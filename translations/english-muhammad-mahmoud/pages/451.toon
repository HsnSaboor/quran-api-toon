quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,Yet they cried him lies; then surely they will indeed be presented forward
  37,128,Except for the most faithful bondmen of Allah
  37,129,And We have left for him (honor) in the later generations
  37,130,"Peace be upon Ilyasin!\" (Elias)"
  37,131,Surely thus We recompense the fair-doers
  37,132,Surely he is one of Our believing bondmen
  37,133,And surely Lut (Lot) is indeed one of the Emissaries
  37,134,As We safely delivered him and his family all together
  37,135,Except an old woman among the laggards
  37,136,Thereafter We destroyed the others
  37,137,And surely you pass by them in the (early) morning
  37,138,And by night; Will you not then consider
  37,139,And surely Yunus (Jonah) is indeed one of the Emissaries
  37,140,As he deserted to the laden ship (s)
  37,141,Then he cast lots. Yet he was of the rebutted
  37,142,"So the whale gobbled him, and he was blameworthy"
  37,143,So had he not been of the extollers (of Allah)
  37,144,He would indeed have lingered in its belly until the Day they will be made to rise again
  37,145,Then We flung him off upon the naked (shore) and he was ailing
  37,146,And We caused to grow over him a tree of gourds
  37,147,"And We sent him to a hundred thousand, or more. (Literally: they may have increased)"
  37,148,Then they believed; so We gave them enjoyment for a while
  37,149,"So, ask them for a pronouncement, \"Has your Lord daughters, and they have sons"
  37,150,"Or even did We create the Angels females, and they were witnesses"
  37,151,"Verily, surely it is of their falsehood, indeed, (that) they say"
  37,152,"Allah has begotten!\" And surely they are liars indeed"
  37,153,Has he elected daughters above sons
