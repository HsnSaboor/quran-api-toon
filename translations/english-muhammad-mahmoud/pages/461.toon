quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,"Is he then whose breast Allah has expanded to Islam, so he (walks) in a Light from his Lord (like the disbelievers)? Then woe to the ones whose hearts are hardened against the Remembrance of Allah! Those are in evident error"
  39,23,"Allah has sent down fairest discourse as a Book, of similar signs (and) oft-repeated, (literally: doubly fair) whereat shiver the skins of the ones who are apprehensive of their Lord; thereafter their skins and their hearts soften to the Remembrance of Allah. That is the guidance of Allah whereby He guides whomever He decides; and whomever Allah leads into error, then in no way will he have any guide"
  39,24,"So, is he who protects (i.e., confronts with his face) (himself) with his face against the odious torment on the Day of the Resurrection (the same as the pious)? And it is said to the unjust, \"Taste (now) whatever you were earning"
  39,25,The ones before them cried lies; then the torment came up to them from where they were not aware
  39,26,"So Allah made them taste disgrace in the present life, (i.e., confronts with his face) and indeed the torment of the Hereafter is greater, if only they do know"
  39,27,"And indeed We have struck for mankind in this Qur'an every (manner) of similitude, that possibly they would remind themselves"
  39,28,"An Arabic Quran, without comprising any crookedness, that possibly they would be pious"
  39,29,"Allah has struck a smilitude: a man in whom associates are at variance with each other, and a man wholly submissive to (one) man. Are the two equal (in likeness)? Praise be to Allah; no indeed, (but) most of them do not know"
  39,30,"Surely you will be dead: and surely they (also) will be dead"
  39,31,Thereafter on the Day of the Resurrection in the Meeting with your Lord you will take adversary (stands) against each other
