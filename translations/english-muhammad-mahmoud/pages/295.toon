quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  18,16,"And as you have kept apart from them and what they worship excepting Allah, so take (your) abode in the cave, (then) your Lord will spread for you of His mercy and will dispose for you a convenient (place) of your Command.\" (i.e., the command of Allah to you; or: your affair)"
  18,17,"And you might have seen the sun when it rose, declining from their cave towards the right; and when it set, it went past them towards the left while they were in a broad fissure of (the cave). That was one of the signs of Allah. Whomever Allah guides, then he is right-guided, and whomever He leads away into error, then you will never find for him a right-minded patron"
  18,18,"And you would have reckoned that they were awake (as) they were lying down, and We turned them about towards the right and towards the left, and their dog stretching out his two fore-legs (Literally: his two arms) on the threshold. If you had viewed them, indeed you would have turned away from them in flight and indeed been filled with horror of them"
  18,19,"And thus We made them rise again that they might ask one another (Literally: among themselves). A speaker from among them said, \"How long have you lingered?\" They said, \"We have lingered a day, or part (Literally: some \"part\" of a day) of a day.\" (Others) said, \"Your Lord knows best how long you have lingered. So send one of you forth with this money to the city, then let him look for whichever of them has the purest (Literally: most cleansed) food, so let him come up to you with a provision thereof, and let him be courteous, and definitely let no man be aware of your (presence)"
  18,20,"Surely in case they get the better of you, they will stone you or bring you back to their creed, and (then) you will never prosper at all"
