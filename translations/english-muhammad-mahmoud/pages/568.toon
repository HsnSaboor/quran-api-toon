quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,So today he has not here now (any) intimate (friend)
  69,36,Neither any food except of foul refuse
  69,37,(That) none except the sinners eat
  69,38,"Yet no, I swear by whatever you behold"
  69,39,And whatever you do not behold
  69,40,Surely it is indeed the saying of an honorable Messenger
  69,41,And in no way is it the saying of a poet- little do you believe
  69,42,Nor the saying of a soothsayer- little are you mindful of
  69,43,A successive sending down from The Lord of the worlds
  69,44,"And if he had talked up against Us any (Literally: some) (false) sayings"
  69,45,Indeed We would have taken (him) by the right hand
  69,46,Thereafter indeed We would have cut (off) (his) aorta
  69,47,Then in no way would anyone of you (be) debarring (Us) from him
  69,48,And surely it is indeed a Reminder to the pious
  69,49,And surely We indeed know that (some) among you are beliers
  69,50,And surely it is indeed a (source of) regret to the disbelievers
  69,51,And surely it is indeed the Truth of certitude
  69,52,"So extol with the Name of your Lord, The Ever-Magnificent"
  70,1,A questioner asked of a befalling torment
  70,2,"For the disbelievers, for which there is no repelling"
  70,3,"From Allah, The Owner of the Stairways"
  70,4,To Him the Angels and the Spirit ascend with difficulty to Him in a Day whereof the determined (length) is fifty thousand years
  70,5,So (endure) patiently with a becoming patience
  70,6,Surely they see it far off
  70,7,And We see it near
  70,8,On the Day when the heaven will be as molten metal
  70,9,And the mountains will be as wool-tufts
  70,10,And no intimate (friend) will ask (another) intimate friend
