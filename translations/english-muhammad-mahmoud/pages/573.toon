  72,14,"And that among us are the Muslims, and among us are the inequitable. So whoever have surrendered (to Allah), then those are they who earnestly sought rectitude"
  72,15,"And as for the inequitable, then they are firewood for Hell"
  72,16,"And that if they had gone straight on the right mode (of life), indeed We would have made them to drink copious water"
  72,17,"That We may tempt them therein; and whoever veers away from the Remembrance of his Lord, He will insert him into a mounting torment"
  72,18,"And that the mosques belong to Allah; so do not invoke, along with Allah, anyone"
  72,19,"And that as soon as the bondman of Allah rose up invoking Him, they almost densely packed upon him"
  72,20,"Say, \"Surely I invoke only my Lord, and I do not associate with Him anyone"
  72,21,"Say, \"Surely I possess (no power) over you, either for harm or for rectitude"
  72,22,"Say, \"Surely never can anyone give me neighborly (protection) from Allah, and never can I find, apart from Him, any shielding"

  72,26,"(He is) The Knower of the Unseen, so He does not disclose His Unseen to anyone"
  72,27,"Excepting to such a Messenger as He is Divinely Satisfied with. Then surely He dispatches (Literally: between his two hands) before (Literally: inserts) him and behind him observers"
  72,28,"That He may know they have already proclaimed the Messages of their Lord. And He has encompassed (all) that is closely (kept) with them, and He has enumerated everything in numbers"
