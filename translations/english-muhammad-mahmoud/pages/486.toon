quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  42,23,"That (is) what Allah gives as good tidings to His bondmen who have believed and done deeds of righteousness. Say, \"I do not ask of you a reward for it, except amity for kinship.\" And whoever scores (Literally: commits) a fair deed, We will give him increase of fairness (i.e., goodness) therein. Surely Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Thankful"
  42,24,"Or even do they say, \"He has fabricated against Allah a lie?\" Yet in case Allah (so) decides, He will seal your heart; and Allah erases untruth and truthfully (upholds) the Truth by His Words. Surely He is Ever-Knowing of the (inmost thoughts) within the breasts (Literally: what the breasts own)"
  42,25,"And He is (The One) Who accepts repentance for His bondmen, and shows clemency towards odious deeds, and knows whatever you perform"
  42,26,"And He responds (to) the ones who have believed and done deeds of righteousness, and He gives them increase of His Grace. And the disbelievers will have a strict torment"
  42,27,"And if Allah were to outspread the provision for His bondmen, they would indeed be inequitable in the earth; but He sends down in a determined (estimate) whatever He decides; surely He is Ever-Cognizant, Ever-Beholding His bondmen"
  42,28,"And He is The (One) Who keeps sending down the succoring (rain) even after they have become despondent, and He spreads His mercy; and He is The Ever-Patronizing, The Ever-Praiseworthy"
  42,29,"And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and of whatever kinds of beast He has disseminated in them, and He is The Ever-Determiner of gathering them when He decides"
  42,30,"And whatever affliction afflicts you, then it is for what your hands have earned; and He is Clement towards much"
  42,31,"And in no way can you even be defiant in the earth; and, apart from Allah, in no way do you have any constant patron or any ready vindicator"
