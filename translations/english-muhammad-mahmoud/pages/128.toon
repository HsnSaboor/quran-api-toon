quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,1,"Praise be to Allah Who created the heavens and the earth, and made darkness (es) and light, thereafter the ones who have disbelieved unjustly set up equals (Or: rivals) to their Lord"
  6,2,"He is (The One) Who created you of clay, thereafter He decreed a term, and a term is stated in His Sight; thereafter you wrangle about that"
  6,3,And He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth. He knows your secret and your speaking aloud and He knows whatever you are earning
  6,4,And in no way is there even a sign of the signs of their Lord that comes up to them except that they are veering away from it
  6,5,So they already cried lies to the Truth as soon as it came to them. Then the tidings of whatever they used to mock will eventually come up to them
  6,6,"Have they not seen how many a generation We caused to perish even before them, (whom) We had established in the earth, in whatever We have not established you, and We sent the heaven upon them plentifully, and made the rivers to run from beneath them? Then We caused them to perish for their guilty (deeds), and We brought into being even after them another generation"
  6,7,"And if We had been sending down upon you a Book on paper, so they touched it with their hands, the ones who have disbelieved would indeed have said, \"Decidedly this is nothing except evident sorcery"
  6,8,"And they said, \"If only an Angel had been sent down on him!\" And (yet), if We had sent down an Angel, the Command would indeed have been decreed; thereafter they would not be respited"
