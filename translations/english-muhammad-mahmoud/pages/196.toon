quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,55,"So let not their riches nor their children make you admire them; surely Allah only wills thereby to torment them in the present life, (Literally: the lowly life, i.e., the life of this world) and that their selves should expire (while) they are disbelievers"
  9,56,"And they swear by Allah that surely they are indeed of you, and in no way are they of you; but they are a people who are terrified"
  9,57,"If they could find a shelter, or (some) cavernous places, or any place of entry, they would indeed turn about and bolt away (to it)"
  9,58,"And of them is he who defames you concerning donations; so in case they are given thereof, they are satisfied; and in case they are not given thereof, only then are they wrathful"
  9,59,"And if they were satisfied with what Allah and His Messenger brought them, and said, \"Enough (Reckoner) for us is Allah ; Allah will soon bring us of His Grace, and (so will) His Messenger; surely we (turn) to Allah, being desirous.\" (i.e. of His Grace)"
  9,60,"Surely donations are only for the poor, and the indigent, and the ones collecting them, (Literally: working (doing) upon them) and the ones whose hearts are brought together, (i.e. newly converted enemies, so as to reconcile their hearts) and the ransoming of necks, (i.e. captives and slaves) and the ones penalized (for debt), and in the way of Allah, and the wayfarer; an ordinance from Allah, and Allah is Ever-Knowing, Ever-Wise"
  9,61,"And of them are the ones who hurt the Prophet and say, \"He is an ear!\" (i.e., He listens to everything, welfare) Say \"An ear (i.e., giving ear, listening) of charity (Or: benefit; the choicest thing, welfare) for you. He believes in Allah, and believes (i.e. trusts, reassures) the believers, and (is) a mercy for the ones of you who have believed; and the ones who hurt the Messenger of Allah, for them is a painful torment"
