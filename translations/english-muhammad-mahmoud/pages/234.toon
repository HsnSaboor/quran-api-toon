quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,109,"So do not (engage) in wrangling about what these (disbelievers) worship; in no way do they worship (anything) except as their fathers worshiped earlier; and surely We will indeed pay them in full their assignment undiminished (i.e., without being diminished)"
  11,110,"And indeed We already brought Musa (Moses) the Book; then they were made to differ regarding it. And had it not been for a Word that has gone before from your Lord, it (i.e., my judgment) would indeed have been decreed between them; and surely about it (the Quran) they are indeed in doubt causing suspicion"
  11,111,"And surely for each one (of them) finally (Or: assuredly) your Lord will indeed pay them definitely in full for their deeds; surely He is Ever-Cognizant of whatever they do"
  11,112,"So go straight, as you have been commanded, (you) and whoever repents with you, and do not be inordinate; surely He is Ever-Beholding whatever you do"
  11,113,"And do not (seek) support (you believers) for the ones who have done injustice, (for) then the Fire (would) touch you; and in no way do you have any patrons apart from Allah, (and) thereafter you will not be vindicated (i.e., if you seek support for the ones who have done injustice)"
  11,114,And keep up the prayer at the two extremities of the daytime and in the early reaches of the night. Surely the fair deeds will put away the odious deeds. That is a Reminding to the mindful
  11,115,"And (endure) patiently, (for) then surely Allah does not leave to waste the reward of the fair-doers"
  11,116,"So, if only there been of the generations even before you, (remaining nations) endowed with (i.e., of understanding) forbidding corruption in the land-only a few of them whom We delivered. And the ones who did injustice closely followed whatever luxury they were made to live in; and they were criminals"
  11,117,And in no way would your Lord indeed cause towns to perish with injustice (while) their population are righteous-doers
