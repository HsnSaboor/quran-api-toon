quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,174,"So they turned over (Or: turned around) with favor from Allah and (His) Grace; no odious (disadvantage) did touch them; and they followed closely the all-blessed Satisfaction of Allah; and Allah is The of Owner of magnificent Grace"
  3,175,"Surely that is only Ash-Shaytan (The all-vicious; i.e., the devil) frightening his patronized ones, so do not fear them and fear Me in case you are believers"
  3,176,"And let them that vie swiftly in disbelief not grieve you surely they will never harm Allah anything; Allah wills that He will set them no portion in the Hereafter, and they will have a tremendous torment"
  3,177,"Surely the ones who have traded disbelief (at the price) of belief will never harm Allah anything, and they will have a painful torment"
  3,178,"And definitely let not the ones who have disbelieved reckon that We reprieve them only (because) it is charitable for themselves; surely We only reprieve them that they might increase in vice, and they will have a degrading torment"
  3,179,"In no way indeed will Allah leave out the believers in whatever (state) you are till He discriminates the wicked from good, and in no way indeed will Allah (allow you) to view the Unseen; but Allah selects out of His Messengers whom He decides. So believe in Allah and His Messengers, and in case you believe and are pious, then there will be for you a magnificent reward"
  3,180,"And definitely let not the ones who are miserly with what Allah has brought them of His Grace reckon that it is charitable for them. No indeed, it is an evil (thing) for them. They will have wrapped (about their necks) whatever they were miserly with, on the Day of the Resurrection, and to Allah is the inheritance of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Ever-Cognizant of whatever you do"
