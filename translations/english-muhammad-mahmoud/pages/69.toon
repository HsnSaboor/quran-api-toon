quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  3,149,"O you who have believed, in case you obey the ones who have disbelieved, they will turn you back on your heels; so you turn over, losers"
  3,150,"No indeed, (but) Allah is your Supreme Patronizer, and He is The Most Charitable of vindicators"
  3,151,"We will soon cast in (to) the hearts of the ones who have disbelieved horror for whatever they associated with Allah for which He has not sent down an all-binding authority; and their abode will be the Fire, and miserable is the lodging of the unjust"
  3,152,"And indeed Allah has already sincerely (made good) His promise (Literally: was truly sincere in His promise) to you as you overwhelmed them by His permission until you were disheartened and contended together about the Command (i.e. the Command of Allah) and disobeyed (i.e. disobeyed the Messenger) even after He had shown you what you love (The reference is to the Battle of 'Uhud when the archers deserted their posts to share in the spoils). Some of you (there were) who would have the present (life) (Literally: the lowly (life), i.e., life of this world) and some of you (there were) who would have the Hereafter. Thereafter He has made you turn about away from them, that he may try you. And He has already been clement towards you; and Allah is The Owner of Grace upon the believers"
  3,153,"As you were mounting and did not twist about for anyone, and the Messenger was calling you in your rear, so He requited you with suffering for suffering that you might not grieve for whatever eluded you nor for what afflicted you; and Allah is Ever-Cognizant of whatever you do"
