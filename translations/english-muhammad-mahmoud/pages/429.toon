quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  34,8,"Has he fabricated against Allah a lie, or is there in him a madness? No indeed, (but) the ones who do not believe in the Hereafter are in the torment and in the farthest error"
  34,9,"So, have they not regarded whatever is before them (Literally: between their hands) and whatever is behind them of the heaven and the earth? In case We (so) decide, We would make the earth to cave in with them, or We would let fall down on them lumps from the heaven. Surely in that is indeed a sign to every penitent bondman"
  34,10,"And indeed We already brought Dawud (David) Grace from Us: \"O you mountains, reiterate Allah's praises) with him, and you birds!\" And We softened for him iron"
  34,11,"(Saying), \"Make (wide) coats of mail, and determine well the links.\" And do all of you righteousness, (for) surely I am Ever-Beholding whatever you do"

And we made the spring of molten brass to flow for him. And of the jinn there were (the ones) who worked before him (Literally: between his hands) by the permission of his Lord. And whoever of them swerved away from our Command, We would let him taste of the torment of the Blaze"

  34,14,"So, as soon as We decreed death for him, in no way did anything indicate to them his death except the beast of the earth eating his rod. Then, as soon as he collapsed, the jinn evidently (saw) that; if they had known the Unseen, in no way would they have lingered in the degrading torment"
