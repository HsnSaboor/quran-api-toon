quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,6,"The promise of Allah! Allah does not fail His promise, but most of mankind do not know"
  30,7,"They know an outward (part) of the present life, (Literally: lowly life, i.e., the life of this world) and of the Hereafter they, (it is) they who are heedless"
  30,8,And have they not meditated within themselves? In no way did Allah create the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them except with the Truth and for a stated term; and surely many of mankind are indeed disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord
  30,9,"And have they not traveled in the earth, (and) so looked into how was the end of those even before them? They were more pervasive in power than themselves, and plowed (Literally: stirred up) the earth, and cultivated it more (i.e., populated it and were more eminent) than they themselves have cultivated it; and their Messengers came to them with the supreme evidence (s); so indeed in no way did Allah do (any) injustice to them, but to themselves they used to do injustice"
  30,10,"Thereafter, the end of the ones who had done odious (deeds) was an utterly odious (end) for that they cried lies to the signs of Allah and used to mock at them"
  30,11,Allah begins creation; thereafter He brings it back again; thereafter to Him you will be returned
  30,12,"And on the Day when the Hour comes up, the criminals will be dumbfounded"
  30,13,"And no intercessors will they have among their associates, and they will be disbelievers in their associates"
  30,14,"And on the Day when the Hour comes up, upon that Day they will part (from each other)"
  30,15,"So, as for the ones who have believed and done deeds of righteousness, then they will be made jubilant in a (green) Meadow"
