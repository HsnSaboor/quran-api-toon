quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  22,47,And they ask you to hasten the torment! And Allah will never fail His promise; and surely a Day in the Reckoning of your Lord is as a thousand years of what you count
  22,48,"And (similarly) many a town I have reprieved, (while) it was unjust; thereafter I took it (away), and to Me is the Destiny"
  22,49,"Say, \"O you mankind, surely I am only for you an evident warner"
  22,50,"So, the ones who have believed and done deeds of righteousness, for them will be forgiveness and an honorable provision"
  22,51,"And the ones who have endeavored against Our signs trying to defy them, those will be the companions (i.e., inhabitants) of Hell-Fire"
  22,52,"And in no way did We send even before you any Messenger or Prophet, except that when he covets, Ash-Shaytan (The ever-vicious, i.e., the Devil) cast into his coveting; so Allah abrogates what Ash-Shaytan casts; (then) thereafter Allah sets clear His signs, and Allah is Ever-Knowing, Ever-Wise"
  22,53,"That He may make whatever Ash-Shaytan (The ever-vicious, i.e., the Devil) casts a temptation for the ones in whose hearts is sickness and the ones whose hearts are hard- and surely the unjust (ones) are indeed in far-reaching opposition"
  22,54,"And that the ones who were brought knowledge may know that it is the Truth from your Lord, (and) so they believe in it; then their hearts be venerating to Him; and surely Allah indeed guides the ones who have believed to a straight Path"
  22,55,And the ones who have disbelieved will not cease wrangling about it until the Hour comes suddenly or there comes up to them the torment of a sterile Day
