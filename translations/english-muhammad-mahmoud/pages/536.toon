quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  56,51,"Thereafter, surely you, you erring ones, the beliers"
  56,52,Indeed you will eat of the trees of Zaqqum
  56,53,So you will be filling therewith (your) bellies
  56,54,Then you will be drinking thereon of scalding water
  56,55,So you will be drinking (like) the drinking of diseased camels wandering with thirst
  56,56,This is their hospitality on the Day of Doom
  56,57,"We, Ever We, created you. Would you then sincerely admit (the Truth)"
  56,58,"So, have you then seen what you ejaculate"
  56,59,"Is it you who create it, or even are We the Creators"
  56,60,"We, Ever We, have determined among you Death; and in no way are We, Ever We, outstripped"
  56,61,(So) that We may exchange the likes of you and bring you into being (again in a fashion) you do not know
  56,62,"And indeed you have already known the earliest bringing into being; (if) had you (known), you would have been mindful"
  56,63,Have you then seen (whatever) you till
  56,64,"Is it you who plant it or are We, Ever We, the Planters"
  56,65,If We had (so) decided We would indeed have made it crushed to pieces; then you would linger on (bitterly) exclaiming
  56,66,Surely we are indeed penalized (for debt)
  56,67,"No indeed, (but) we are dispossessed"
  56,68,Have you then seen the water you drink
  56,69,"Is it you who have sent it down from the rainy clouds or are We, Ever We, The Senders down"
  56,70,"If We had (so) decided, We would have made it bitter; so had you only thanked (Us)"
  56,71,Have you then seen the fire you flare up
  56,72,"Is it you who brought its tree into being, or are We, Ever We, The Bringers into being"
  56,73,"We, Ever We, have made it for a Reminder and an enjoyment for the denizens in the desert"
  56,74,"So extol with the Name of your Lord, The Ever-Magnificent"
  56,75,Then no! I swear by the sites of the stars
  56,76,"And surely it is indeed a tremendous oath, if you only know (it)"
