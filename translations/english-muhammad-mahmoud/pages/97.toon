quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"No charity (i.e. benefit) is there in much of their private conferences, except for him who commands donation (i.e. enjoins \"people\" to donate), or beneficence, or righteousness (Or: conciliation and reform) among mankind. And whoever performs that seeking the gracious satisfaction of Allah, then We will eventually bring him a magnificent reward"
  4,115,"And whoever constantly opposes the Messenger, even after the guidance has become evident to him, and closely follows (a way) other than the believers'way, We turn him away to whatever (patron) he turns away to, and We roast him at Hell; and what an odious Destiny"
  4,116,"Surely Allah does not forgive that (anything be) with Him associated; and (anything) whatever, apart from that, He forgives to whomever He decides. And whoever associates (anything) with Allah, then he has readily erred into far error"
  4,117,"Decidedly they invoke (nothing) apart from Him except females; and decidedly they invoke (nothing) except a steadfastly insurgent Shaytan (An all-vicious one, i.e., satan)"
  4,118,"Allah cursed him. And he said, \"Indeed I will definitely take to myself of Your bondmen an ordained assignment"
  4,119,"And indeed I will definitely lead them into error, and indeed I will definitely arouse (vain) covetings in them, and indeed I will definitely command them (and) so indeed they will definitely cut off the cattle's ears; (One of the superstitions of the pagans) and indeed I will definitely command them (and) so indeed they will definitely change the creation of Allah.\" And whoever takes Ash-Shaytan (An all-vicious one, i.e., satan) to himself for a constant patron apart from Allah, then he has already suffered (Literally: lost) evidently the greatest loss"
  4,120,"He promises them and arouses vain covetings in them; and in no way does Ash-Shaytan (The all-vicious, i.e., the Devil) promise them (anything) except delusion"
  4,121,"Those (will have) their abode in Hell, and they will find no evasion from it"
