quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,44,"And in no way were you (i.e., Muhammad) beside the western (Mount) as We decreed to Musa (Moses) the Command, and in no way were you of the ones witnessing"
  28,45,"But We brought into being generations, (and) so ages (seemed) long for them. And in no way were you lodging among the population of Madyan, reciting to them Our signs, but We were sending (Messengers)"
  28,46,"And in no way were you beside At- Tur (i.e., the Mount) as We called out. But it is a mercy from your Lord, that you may warn a people to whom in no way did (any) warner come up even before you, that possibly they would remind themselves"
  28,47,"And had it not been (that you are sent to them), an affliction would afflict them for what their hands have forwarded, then they might say, \"Our Lord, had You sent a Messenger to us, then we should have closely followed Your signs and been among the believers"
  28,48,"Then as soon as the Truth came to them from Our Providence they said, \"Had he not been brought the like of what was brought to Musa!\" (Moses) And did they not disbelieve in what was brought to M?s'a earlier? They said, \"Two kinds of sorcery (Literally: two sorceries) mutually backing each other!\" And they said, \"Surely in each (of them) we are disbelievers"
  28,49,"Say, \"Then come up with a Book from the Providence of Allah that gives (fairer) guidance (Literally: more guiding) than these (two), (and) I (should) closely follow it, in case you are sincere"
  28,50,"So, in case they do not respond to you, then know that they are only closely following their prejudices. And who is further into error than he who closely follows his prejudice, without guidance from Allah? Surely Allah does not guide the unjust people"
