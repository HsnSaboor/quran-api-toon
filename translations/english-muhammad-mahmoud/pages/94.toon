quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,(The ones) of the believers sitting back-other than the ones (suffering) harm-are not the equals of the ones who strive in the way of Allah with their riches and their selves. Allah has graced the ones who strive with their riches and their selves with a (superior) degree over the ones sitting back; and to each Allah has promised the fairest (reward); and Allah has graced the ones striving over the ones sitting back with a magnificent reward
  4,96,"Degrees (of Grace) from Him, and forgiveness and mercy; and Allah has been Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
  4,97,"Surely the ones whom the Angels take up, (while) they are unjust to themselves- (to them) (the Angels) say, \"In what (condition) were you?\" (i.e., In what circumstances were you? Of what religion were you?) They say, \"We were deemed weak in the earth.\" They (the Angels) say, \"Was not the earth of Allah wide so that you (could) have emigrated in it?\" So, the abode for those (men) is Hell, and what an odious Destiny"
  4,98,Except (the ones) deemed weak among the men and women and newborns (who) are unable (to contrive) a device and are not guided to a way
  4,99,"So for those Allah may be clement towards them, and Allah has been Ever-Clement, Ever-Forgiving"
  4,100,"And whoever emigrates in the way of Allah will find in the earth many reinstatements and an affluence. And whoever goes out of his home an emigrant to Allah and His Messenger, (and) thereafter death overtakes him, then his reward will have already befallen on Allah; and Allah has been Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
  4,101,"And when you strike in the earth, (i.e., journey in the earth) then there is no fault in you that you shorten the prayer in case you fear that the ones who have disbelieved may make an attempt on you; (Literally) surely the disbelievers have been for you an evident enemy"
