quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  24,54,"Say, \"Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. Yet if you turn away, then surely upon him (rests) only what he is burdened with. And upon you (rests) only what you are burdened with. And in case you obey him, you will (find) guidance. And in no way is the Messenger (burdened) except with the evident Proclamation"
  24,55,"Allah has promised the ones of you who have believed and done deeds of righteous- ness that indeed He will definitely make them successors in the earth, (even) as He made the ones who were before them successors, and that indeed He will definitely establish for them their religion that He is Divinely satisfied with (i.e., that He approves of) for them, and that indeed He will definitely give them in exchange, even after their fear, security. \"They shall worship Me, not associating with Me anything.\" And whoever disbelieves after that, then those are they (who are) the immoral"
  24,56,"And keep up the prayer, and bring the Zakat, (Pay the poor-dues) and obey the Messenger, that possibly you would be granted mercy"

Thus Allah makes evident to you the signs, and Allah is Ever-Knowing, Ever-Wise"
