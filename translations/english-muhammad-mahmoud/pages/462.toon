quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  39,32,So who is more unjust than he who lies against Allah and cries lies to the sincere (faith) as it has come to him? Is there not in Hell a lodging for the disbelievers
  39,33,"And he who has come with the sincere (faith) and has sincere faith in it, those are they who are pious"
  39,34,They will have whatever they decide (on) in the Providence of their Lord; that is the recompense of the fair-doers
  39,35,"That Allah may expiate for them the most odious of whatever they did, and recompense them with their reward of the fairest of that which they were doing"
  39,36,"Will not Allah suffice His bondman? And they frighten you with the ones apart from Him, and whomever Allah leads into error, then in no way will he have any guide"
  39,37,"And whomever Allah guides, then in no way will he have a misleader; is not Allah (unceasingly) Ever-Mighty, Owner of vengeance"
  39,38,"And indeed in case you ask them, \"Who created the heavens and the earth?\" indeed they will definitely say Allah.\" Say, (This is addressed to the Ptopet) \"Have you seen then the ones you invoke apart from Allah.

  39,39,"Say, (This is addressed to the Ptophet) \"O my people, behave (Literally: do) according to your situation; surely I am behaving (according to my situation); then eventually you will know"
  39,40,To whom will come up a torment disgracing him; and upon him will alight a perpetual torment
