quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  24,37,"Men whom neither commerce nor trade (Literally: selling) diverts from the Remembrance of Allah, and keeping up the prayer, and the bringing of the Zakat, (Paying the poor-dues) fearing a Day when hearts and beholdings will be turning about"
  24,38,"That Allah may recompense them for the fairest of what they did, and increase (reward) for them of His Grace. And Allah provides whomever He decides (to), without reckoning"
  24,39,"And the ones who have disbelieved, their deeds are as a mirage in a low land, which the man all-athirst reckons to be water, till when he comes to it, he finds it nothing, and at it he finds Allah. Then He pays him his reckoning in full; and Allah is swift at the reckoning"
  24,40,"Or (they are) as darkness (es) in a tumultuous sea (vast and deep) enveloped by waves above which are waves, upon which are clouds: darknesses above each other, (Some of them \"are\" above some \"others\") when he brings out his hand, he could almost not see it. And for whomever Allah makes no light, then in no way (can) he have light"
  24,41,"Have you not seen that to Allah extol whoever are in the heavens and the earth and the birds outstretching (their wings)? (Or: in ranks) Each has already known its prayer and its Extolment; and Allah is Ever-Knowing of whatever they perform"
  24,42,And to Allah is the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and to Allah is the Destiny
  24,43,"Have you not seen that Allah wafts clouds, thereafter joins them together, thereafter makes them accumulated, then you see the raindrops coming out of the midst of them? And He keeps sending down from the heaven mountains, wherein is hail. So He afflicts with it whomever He decides and turns it about from whomever He decides. The splendor of His lightning almost goes away with (i.e., takes away) the beholdings (i.e., eyesights)"
