quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  29,46,"And do not dispute (This is addressed to the believers) with the population of the Book (Or: family of the Book; i.e., the Jews and Christians) except in the fairest (manner), except for the ones of them who have done injustice; and say, \"We believe in that which has been sent down to us and has been sent down to you. And our God and your God is One, and to Him we are Muslims.\" (Literally: We surrender)"
  29,47,And thus We have sent down to you the Book. So the ones to whom We have brought the Book believe in it; and (some) of these believe in it; and in no way does anyone repudiate Our signs except the disbelievers
  29,48,"And in no way did you recite any Book before (this), nor did you pen it with your right (hand); then the wrongdoers (Literally: the doers) would indeed suspect it"
  29,49,"No indeed; it (i.e., the Book) is supremely evident signs in the breasts of the ones who have been brought knowledge; and in no way does anyone repudiate Our signs except the unjust"
  29,50,"And they have said, \" (if only) the had been signs sent down upon him from his Lord!\" Say, \"Surely the signs are only in the Providence of Allah, and surely I am only an evident warner"
  29,51,And does it not suffice them that We have sent down upon you the Book (that is) recited to them? Surely in that is indeed a mercy and reminding to a people who believe
  29,52,"Say, \" Allah suffices as an Ever-Present witness between me and you. He knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth.\" And the ones who have believed in untruth and disbelieved in Allah, those are they who are the losers"
