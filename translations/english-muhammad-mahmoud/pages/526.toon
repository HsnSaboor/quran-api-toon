quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,And (by) the Star when it tumbles down
  53,2,"In no way has your companion (The Prophet) erred, and in no way is he misguided"
  53,3,And in no way does he pronounce (any word) out of prejudice
  53,4,Decidedly it is nothing except a revelation revealed
  53,5,One of valiant powers has taught him
  53,6,"Owner of resolute splendor; (Literally: ability to transform; to convey revelation, i.e. Jibril \"Angle Gabriel) so he leveled himself"
  53,7,(When) he was on the most exalted horizon
  53,8,"Thereafter he (came) within reach, then hung suspended"
  53,9,So he was at two bows (distance) or (even) closer (still)
  53,10,(Then He Allah) revealed to His bondman what He revealed
  53,11,In no way did the heart-sight lie (about) what it saw
  53,12,Will you then wrangle with him about what he sees
  53,13,And indeed he did already see him (during) another descent
  53,14,At the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary
  53,15,At it is the Garden of the Abode
  53,16,As that which envelops did envelop the Lote-Tree
  53,17,"In no way did (his) beholding (i.e., the eyesight) swerve, and in no way was it inordinate"
  53,18,"Indeed he has already seen of the signs of his Lord, the greatest"
  53,19,Have you then seen Al-Lat and Al- cUzza
  53,20,"And Manat, (These are the names of idols) the third, the other"
  53,21,Do you have the male (s) and He the female (s)
  53,22,"Lo, that were (really) a division most unreasonable"
  53,23,"Decidedly they are nothing except names you have named, you and your fathers. In no way has Allah sent down concerning them any all-binding authority. Decidedly they closely follow nothing except surmise and what (prejudices) the selves yearn to; and indeed the guidance has already come to them from their Lord"
  53,24,Or even should man have whatever he covets
  53,25,"Yet, to Allah belongs the Hereafter, and the First (life)"
  53,26,And how many an Angel (there is) in the heavens whose intercession does not avail anything except even after Allah gives permission to whomever He decides and He is satisfied
