quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,150,"And as soon as Musa returned to his people, all-enraged and sorrowful, he said, \"Miserable is what you have done while staying behind me (just) after my (departure). Would you hasten on the Command of your Lord?\" And he cast down the Tablets and took hold of his brother's head, dragging him towards himself. He said, \"Son of my mother, surely the people deemed me weak and were almost about to kill me. So do not make the enemies to gloat over me, and do not set me (Literally: do not make me) among the unjust people"
  7,151,"He said, \"Lord! Forgive me and my brother and cause us to enter into Your mercy; and You are The Most Merciful of the merciful"
  7,152,"Surely the ones who took to themselves the Calf anger will soon pertain to them from their Lord, and humiliation in the present life; (Literally: the lowly life, i.e., the life of this world) and thus We recompense the fabricators"
  7,153,"And the ones who do odious deeds, thereafter repent even after that and believe, surely even after that your Lord is indeed Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
  7,154,"And as soon as Musa's (Moses) anger calmed down, he took the Tablets; and in the transcript of them was a guidance and a mercy to the ones who hold their Lord in awe"
  7,155,"And Musa (Moses) chose his people, seventy men, for Our fixed time; then, as soon as the commotion took them, he said, \"Lord! If you had so decided, You would have caused them to perish earlier and me. Would You cause us to perish for what the foolish ones of us have performed? Decidedly it is (nothing) except Your temptation, whereby You lead to error whomever You decide, and You guide whomever You decide. You are our Ever-Patronizing Patron, so forgive us and have mercy on us, and You are The Most Charitable of forgivers"
