  8,34,"And what (plea) have they, that Allah should not torment them, and they are barring from the Inviolable Mosque, and in no way have they been its patrons? Decidedly none (could be) its patrons except the pious ones; but most of them do not know"
  8,35,"And in no way is their prayer at the Home anything except a whistling and a clapping of hands. So, taste the torment for that you have disbelieved (Literally: you were disbelieving)"
  8,36,Surely the ones who have disbelieved expend their riches to bar from the way of Allah; so they will soon expend them; thereafter these will be (a cause) of regret for them; thereafter they will be overcome; and the ones who have disbelieved will be mustered to Hell
  8,37,"That Allah may discriminate the wicked from the good, and set up the wicked one upon another; (Literally: make some of them upon some \"others\") (and) so accumulate them up altogether, and then set them up in Hell; those are they (who are) the losers"
  8,38,"Say to the ones who have disbelieved, in case they refrain, whatever has already passed will be forgiven them; and in case they go back, then the enactment (for) the earliest (people) has already gone by"
  8,39,"And fight them, till there is no temptation (Or: sedition, persecution) and the religion is all for Allah; so in case they refrain, then surely Allah is Ever-Beholding whatever they do"
  8,40,"And in case they turn away, then know that Allah is your Supreme Patronizer, The Excellent Supreme Patronizer, and The Excellent Supreme Vindicator"
