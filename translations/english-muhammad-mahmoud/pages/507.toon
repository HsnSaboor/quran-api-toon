quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"The ones who have disbelieved and barred from the way of Allah, (He) will make their deeds to err away"
  47,2,And the ones who have believed and done deeds of righteousness and have believed in what has been successively sent down upon Muhammad-and it is the Truth from their Lord-He will expiate for them their odious deeds and will make righteous their state
  47,3,That is because the ones who have disbelieved have closely followed untruth and the ones who have believed have closely followed the Truth from their Lord. Thus Allah strikes their similitudes for mankind
  47,4,"So when you meet the ones who have disbelieved, then it is striking of the necks until, when you have subjugated (Wrongly understood by Arberry and others to mean \"slaughter\") them, then uphold the bonds; (i.e., take them captives) then (it is) either being bounteous (i.e., \"showing\" bounty by setting them free) hereafter (to them), or (exacting) ransom, until the war lays down its encumbrances. So it shall be; and if Allah had (so) decided, He would have vindicated Himself upon them; but that He may try some of you by means of others (Literally: by means of some \"others\"). And the ones who have been killed in the way of Allah, then He will never send their deeds into error"
  47,5,He will soon guide them and make righteous their state
  47,6,And He will cause them to enter the Garden that He has acquainted them with
  47,7,"O you who have believed, in case you vindicate Allah, He will give you victory and confirm your feet (i.e., give you victory)"
  47,8,"And the ones who have disbelieved, then misfortune is for them, and He will make their deeds to err away"
  47,9,"That is for that they hate what Allah has sent down, so He has frustrated their deeds"
  47,10,"Then have they not traveled in the earth (and) so looked into how was the end of the ones even before them? Allah destroyed (their houses) above them, and the disbelievers will have the likes thereof"
  47,11,That is for that Allah is the Supreme Patronizer of the ones who have believed and (for) that the disbelievers have no patronizer
