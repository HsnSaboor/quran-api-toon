quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  21,11,"And how many a town that was unjust We have shattered, and We brought into being after it another people"
  21,12,"Then, when they perceived Our violence, only then did they (run) scampering out of it"
  21,13,"Do not scamper out and return to whatever luxury you were given to live in and to your dwellings, that you would be questioned"
  21,14,"They said, \"O woe to us! Surely we have been unjust"
  21,15,So that their (unjust) plea did not cease until We made them a harvest mown down
  21,16,And in no way did We create the heaven and the earth and whatever is between them as playing
  21,17,"If We had taken to Us a diversion, We would indeed have taken it to Us from very close to Us, in case We are performing (that)"
  21,18,"No indeed, We hurl the Truth against the untruth; so (Truth) smashes it; then, only then does (untruth) expire. And woe to you for whatever you describe"
  21,19,"And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth; and whoever are in His Providence do not wax too proud to do Him worship, nor do they (grow) weary. (Or: nor do they regret)"
  21,20,They extol (Him) by night and by daytime (and) they do not flag
  21,21,Or even have they taken to themselves gods from the earth who make (the dead) rise up again
  21,22,"If there were in both of them (i.e., the heaven and the earth) gods expcept Allah, indeed they would (both) suffer corruption. All Extolment be to Allah, The Lord of the Throne, above whatever they describe"
  21,23,"He will not be questioned as (to) what He performs, and they will be questioned"
  21,24,"Or even have they taken to themselves gods apart from Him? Say, \"Offer your proof! This is the Remembrance of whomever are with me, and the Remembrance of whomever were before me.\" No indeed, most of them do not know the Truth, so they are veering away"
