  42,52,"And thus We have revealed to you a Spirit of Our Command. In no way did you realize what the Book was, nor the belief; but We have made it a Light, whereby We guide whomever We decide of Our bondmen. And surely you indeed guide to a straight Path"

  43,6,And how many a Prophet We sent among the earliest (people)
  43,7,"And in no way did a Prophet come up to them, except that they used to mock at him"
  43,8,"So We caused to perish (people) more valiant in assault than they, and the similitude of the earliest (people) has passed away"

  43,10,(He) Who made the earth to be a cradle for you and made ways for you therein that possibly you would be guided
