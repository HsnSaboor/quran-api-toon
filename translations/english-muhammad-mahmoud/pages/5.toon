quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,25,"And give good tidings to the ones who have believed and done deeds of righteousness that for them are Gardens from beneath which Rivers run. Whenever they are provided with any produce therefrom (once) as a provision, they will say, \"This is the (same) as we were provided earlier.\"And they are brought (them) in (perfect) resemblance; and therein they will have purified spouses and they are therein eternally (abiding)"
  2,26,"Surely Allah does not shy from striking a likeness even of a gnat, or anything above it. So for the ones who have believed, (then) they know that it is the Truth from their Lord, and as for the ones who have disbelieved, then they say, \"What is it that Allah would (teach) by this for a similitude?\"Thereby He leads many into error, and thereby He guides many; and thereby in no way does He lead into error anyone except the immoral. (The ungodly, the depraved)"
  2,27,"The ones who break the covenant of Allah even after its (binding) compact and cut (off) what Allah has commanded to be held together and corrupt in the earth, those are they (who are) the losers"
  2,28,"How do you disbelieve in Allah and you were dead, then He gave you life, thereafter He (causes) you to die, (and) thereafter He gives you life (again), (and) thereafter to Him you will be returned"
  2,29,"He is (The One) Who created for you whatever is in the earth altogether. Thereafter He leveled Himself (How He did so is beyond human understanding stauling) to the heaven; so He leveled them seven heavens, and He is Ever-Knowing of everything"
