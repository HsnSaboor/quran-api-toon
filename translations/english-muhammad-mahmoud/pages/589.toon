quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,"On couches, looking (down upon them)"
  83,36,Have the steadfast disbelievers been requited for what they were performing
  84,1,When the heaven will be cloven
  84,2,And will listen (submissively) to its Lord- and it will be truly bound to (do so)
  84,3,And when the earth will be widely extended
  84,4,And will cast forth what is in it and will void itself
  84,5,And will listen (submissively) to its Lord- and it will be truly bound to (do so)
  84,6,"O you man, surely you are exerting yourself to your Lord with great exertion, then you will be meeting Him"
  84,7,"So, as for him who is brought his Book in his right (hand)"
  84,8,Then he will eventually be reckoned an easy reckoning
  84,9,"And he will turn over (Ingalaba: Literally: turn over) to his family pleased"
  84,10,And as for him who is brought his Book beyond his back
  84,11,Then he will call for detriment
  84,12,And he will roast at a Blaze
  84,13,"Surely he (once lived) among his family, pleasured"
  84,14,"Surely he surmised he would never recede (Or: return)"
  84,15,"Yes indeed, his Lord has been Ever-Beholding (of) him"
  84,16,Yet no! I swear by the twilight
  84,17,And the night and whatever load it has
  84,18,And the moon when it grows full
  84,19,"Indeed you will definitely ride state after state (i.e., travel from one stage \"of life\" to another)"
  84,20,For what reason then do they not believe
  84,21,"And when the Qur'an is read to them, they do not prostrate themselves"
  84,22,"No indeed, (but) the ones who have disbelieved are crying lies"
  84,23,And Allah knows best whatever they heedfully harbor (in their breasts)
  84,24,So give them tidings of a painful torment
  84,25,Except the ones who have believed and done deeds of righteousness- they will have a reward bountifully unfailing
