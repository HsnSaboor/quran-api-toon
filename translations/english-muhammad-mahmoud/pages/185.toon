quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,62,"And in case they would (like) to deceive you, then surely Allah is enough (i.e., enough Reckoner) for you; He is The One Who has aided you with His victory and with the believers"
  8,63,"And He has brought their hearts together (Literally: joined \"between\" their hearts). If you had expended whatever is in the earth altogether, in no way could you have brought their hearts together; but Allah has brought them together; surely He is Ever-Mighty, Ever-Wise"
  8,64,"O you Prophet, Allah is enough (i.e., your Reckoner) for you and (for) the ones of the believers who closely follow you"
  8,65,"O you Prophet, exhort the believers to the fight. In case there are twenty of you, patient (men), they will overcome two hundred; and in case there are a hundred of you, they will overcome a thousand of the ones who have disbelieved for that they are a people who do not comprehend"
  8,66,"Now Allah has lightened it for you, and He has known that there is weakness in you. So, in case there are a hundred of you patient (men), they will overcome two hundred; and in case there are of you a thousand, they will overcome two thousand by the permission of Allah, and Allah is with the patient"
  8,67,"In no way can any Prophet have captives until he has subjugated (the enemy) in the earth; you (i.e., the believers) are willing to have the (chance) advantages of the present (life), (Literally: the lowly \"life\", i.e., the life of this world) and Allah wills the Hereafter; and Allah is Ever-Mighty, Ever-Wise"
  8,68,"Had it not been for a prescription (Literally: a Book) that has gone before from Allah, a tremendous torment for what you have taken would indeed have touched you"
  8,69,"So, eat of what you have taken as booty, such as is lawful (and) good; and be pious to Allah; surely Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
