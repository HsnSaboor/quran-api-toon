quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,The believers have already prospered
  23,2,The ones who in their prayer are submissive
  23,3,And the ones who from idle talk are veering away
  23,4,"And the ones who at giving the Zakat (i.e., paying the poor-dues) are active. (Literally: are performers)"
  23,5,And the ones who are preservers of their private parts
  23,6,"Except from their spouses and what their right hands possess, then surely they are not blameworthy. (literally: other than being blameworthy)"
  23,7,"Then whoever inequitably seeks beyond that, then those are the aggressors themselves"
  23,8,And they are the ones who pay heed to their deposits and their covenant
  23,9,And they are the ones who preserve their prayers
  23,10,They are those (who are) the inheritors
  23,11,Who will inherit Paradise. They are therein eternally (abiding)
  23,12,And indeed We already created man of an extraction of clay
  23,13,"Thereafter We made him a sperm-drop, in an established residence"
  23,14,"Thereafter We created the sperm-drop into a clot, (Or: embryo) then We created the clot into a chewed up morsel, then We created the chewed up morsel into bones, then We dressed the bones (in) flesh; thereafter We brought him into being as another creation. So Supremely Blessed be Allah, The Fairest of creators"
  23,15,"Thereafter surely after that you will indeed die (Literally: be dead)"
  23,16,Thereafter on the Day of the Resurrection you will surely be made to rise again
  23,17,And indeed We already created above you seven roads; and in no way have We been heedless of creation
