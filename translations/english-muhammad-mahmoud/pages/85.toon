quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,38,"And also (for) (the ones) who expend their riches showing off to (other) men, (Literally: mankind) and do not believe in Allah nor in the Last Day. And whoever has Ash-Shatan (The all-vicious, i.e., the Devil) for a comrade, then how odious is such a comrade"
  4,39,"And what would it (harm) them (Literally: how could it be \"taken\" against them) if they believed in Allah and the Last Day, and expended of whatever Allah has provided them? And of them Allah has been Ever-Knowing"
  4,40,"Surely Allah does not do injustice so much as an atom's weight, and in case it is a fair deed, He will double it and bring from very close to Him a magnificent reward"
  4,41,How then will it be when We cause to come from every nation a witness and cause you to come as a witness against these
  4,42,"Upon that Day, (the ones) who have disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger do like that the earth were leveled with them; and they will not keep back from Allah any discourse (i.e. about any happening)"
  4,43,"O you who have believed, do not draw near to prayer (when) you are drunken until you know what you are saying, nor (when) you are ritually unclean, (i.e. unclean through the emission of semen, or sexual discharge \"in woman\") except when you are traversing a way, until you have washed yourselves. And in case you are sick, or on a journey, or (in case) any of you comes from the privy, or you have had contact with women, yet you have not found water, so have recourse to good soil, (i.e. a high dry place, a mounting place) then wipe (most of) your faces and hands. Surely Allah has been Ever-Clement, Ever-Forgiving"
  4,44,"Have you not regarded (the ones) who were brought an assignment of the Book trading errancy, and would (like) you (also) to err from the way"
