quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,44,"Allah turns about (i.e., alternates) the night and the day-time. Surely in that is indeed a lesson for the ones endowed with beholdings"
  24,45,"And Allah created every beast of water; so of them (is a kind) that goes (Literally: walks) upon its belly; and of them (there is a kind) that goes upon two legs, and of them (a kind) that goes upon four. Allah creates whatever He decides; surely Allah is Ever-Determiner of everything"
  24,46,"Indeed We have already sent down demonstrably evident signs, and Allah guides whomever He decides to a straight Path"
  24,47,"And they say, \"We believe in Allah and in the Messenger, and we obey.\" Thereafter a group of them turn away even after that, and in no way are those ever the believers"
  24,48,"And when they are called to Allah and His Messenger that he (The Messenger) may judge between them, only then are a group of them veering away (from it)"
  24,49,"And in case they truly (have a case), (Literally: they are in the right) they will come up to it compliant"
  24,50,"Then is there sickness in their hearts, or do they suspect (Our judgment), or do they fear that Allah may encroach upon them, and His Messenger (may encroach)? No indeed, those are they who are the unjust"
  24,51,"Surely the saying of believers when they are called to Allah and His Messenger that he (The Messenger) may judge between them is only that they say, \"We hear and we obey.\" And those are they (who are) the prosperers"
  24,52,"And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger and is apprehensive of Allah and is pious towards Him, then those are they (who are) the triumphant"
  24,53,"And they have sworn by Allah their most earnest oaths (that) indeed in case you command them, indeed they will definitely go out. Say, \"Do not swear (i.e. He recognizes your failure to obey). Beneficent obedience (is better). Surely Allah is Ever-Cognizant of whatever you do"
