quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  67,13,"And be secret in your speech, or say it aloud; surely He is Ever-Knowing of the (inmost thoughts) within the breasts (Literally: what the breasts own)"
  67,14,"Will He not know, (He) Who created? And He is The Ever-Kind, The Ever-Cognizant"
  67,15,He is (The One) Who made the earth tractable to you; so walk in its territories and eat of His provision; and to Him is the Rising up
  67,16,"Do you (feel) secure that He Who is in the heaven will not cause the earth to cave in on you? (For) then, only then, it will be whirling"
  67,17,Or even do you (feel) secure that He Who is in the heaven will not send against you a squall of gravel? So you will soon know how My warning is
  67,18,And indeed the ones even before them already cried lies; then how was My disclaiming
  67,19,"And have they not regarded the birds above them outstretching (Or: in ranks) (their wings), and contracting (Or: spreading \"or\" folding their wings) (them)? In no way can anyone hold them except The All-Merciful; surely He is Ever-Beholding everything"
  67,20,"Or even who is this that will be a host for you to vindicate you, apart from The All-Merciful? Decidedly the disbelievers are in nothing except delusion"
  67,21,"Or even who is this that will provide for you in case He holds back His provision? No indeed, (but) they still insist on (their) rebellion and repulsion"
  67,22,"Then, is he who walks tossed down upon his face better guided than he who walks (perfectly) level on a straight Path"
  67,23,"Say, \"He is The One Who brought you into being, and made for you hearing, and be holdings, (i.e., eyesight\"s\") and heart sights; (but) little do you thank Him"
  67,24,"Say, \"He is The One Who propagated you in the earth, and to Him you will be mustered"
  67,25,"And they say, \"When will this promise (come to pass) in case you are sincere"
  67,26,"Say, \"Surely the knowledge is only in the Providence of Allah, and surely I am only an evident Warner"
