quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  35,12,"And in no way can the two seas be equal; this is sweet, gratifying (to taste) palatable as a drink; and this (other) is salt, bitter (to the tongue); and of each you eat fresh flesh and draw forth ornaments for you to wear. And you see the ships plowing through it that you may seek of His Grace and that possibly you would thank (Him)"
  35,13,"He inserts the night into the daytime and inserts the daytime into the night, and He has subjected the sun and the moon, each of them running to a stated term. That is Allah your Lord; to Him belongs The Kingdom; and the ones you invoke apart from Him, in no way do they possess as much as the skin of a date-stone"
  35,14,"In case you invoke them, they will not hear your invocation; and if they heard, in no way would they respond to you. And on the Day of the Resurrection they will disown (Literally: disbelieve) your associating them (with Allah). And none can fully inform you like One Who is Ever-Cognizant"
  35,15,"O you mankind, you are the poor (in relation) to Allah; and Allah is The One Who is The Ever-Affluent, The Ever-Praiseworthy"
  35,16,"In case He (so) decides, He can put you away and come up (instead) with a new creation"
  35,17,And in no way is that a mighty thing for Allah
  35,18,"And no encumbered self can be encumbered with the encumbrance of (i.e. bear the burden of) another (self). And in case a heavy-burdened (self) calls for its burden (to be carried), not a thing of it will be carried, though he be a near kinsman. Surely you warn only (the ones) who are apprehensive of their Lord in the Unseen and keep up the prayer. And whoever cleanses himself, then he cleanses it for himself. (i.e., for his own benefit) And to Allah is the Destiny"
