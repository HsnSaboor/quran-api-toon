quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  14,34,"And He has brought you of all you asked Him; and in case you number the favor (s) of Allah, you (cannot) enumerate them. Surely man is indeed constantly unjust, most disbelieving"
  14,35,"And as Ibrahim (Abraham) said, \"Lord! Make this land secure and make me and my seeds (Or: sons) avoid worshiping idols"
  14,36,"Lord! Surely they have led many of mankind into error. So whoever follows me, then surely he is of me; and whoever disobeys me, then surely You are Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
  14,37,"Our Lord, surely I have made (some) of my offspring to dwell in a valley that is not under cultivation (Literally: other than that \"owning\" plantation) at Your Inviolable Home, our Lord, that they may keep up the prayer. So make heart-sights of mankind yearn towards them and provide them with products, that possibly they would thank (You)"
  14,38,"Our Lord, surely You know whatever we conceal and whatever we make public; and in no way is anything whatever concealed from Allah in the earth or in the heaven"
  14,39,"Praise be to Allah, Who has bestowed upon me, though being great with (years), (i.e., though I am old) Shuaayb and Ishaq; (Ishmael and Isaac, respectively) surely my Lord is indeed Ever-Hearing of invocation"
  14,40,"Lord! Make me one who keeps up the prayer and of my offspring (ones who keep up the prayer), our Lord, and graciously accept my invocation"
  14,41,"Our Lord, forgive me, and my parents, and the believers upon the Day when the reckoning will come up"
  14,42,And definitely do not reckon that Allah is heedless of what the unjust (ones) are doing; surely He only defers them to a Day (when) be holdings will glaze over
