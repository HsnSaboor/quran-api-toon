quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,"As his Lord called out to him in the supremely holy valley, Tuwa"
  79,17,"Go to Firaawn; (Pharaoh) surely he has grown tyrannical (Or: inordinate)"
  79,18,"So say (to him), Would you (be ready) to cleanse yourself"
  79,19,"And that I should guide you to your Lord, then you will be apprehensive of (Him)"
  79,20,So he (Moses) showed him (Pharaoh) the greatest sign
  79,21,Yet he (Pharaoh) cried lies and disobeyed
  79,22,Thereafter he withdrew in a (hasty) endeavor
  79,23,So he mustered and called out
  79,24,"Then he said, \"I am your lord, most exalted"
  79,25,Then Allah took him (away) with the torture of the Hereafter and the First (life)
  79,26,Surely in that is indeed a lesson for him who is apprehensive
  79,27,Are you harder in creation than the heaven? He built it
  79,28,"He raised up its vault, then He molded it"
  79,29,And He bedimmed its night and brought out its forenoon
  79,30,"And the earth, after that He flattened it (for life)"
  79,31,"There from He brought out its water, and its pasture"
  79,32,"And the mountains He made steady, (i.e., made them anchorages)"
  79,33,An enjoyment for you and your cattle
  79,34,So when the Greatest Catastrophe comes
  79,35,On the Day when man will remind himself (of) whatever he has endeavored (to achieve)
  79,36,And Hell-Fire is brought forth for whoever sees
  79,37,"Then, as for him who was inordinate"
  79,38,"And preferred the present life, (Literally: lowly life, i.e., the life of this world)"
  79,39,Then surely Hell-Fire will be the (only) abode
  79,40,"And as for him who feared the station of his Lord (i.e., punishment from his lord) and forbade the self (its) prejudices"
  79,41,Then surely the Garden will be the (only) abode
  79,42,"They ask you about the Hour: when will it have its berthing? (Literally: anchorage; i.e., when will it be)"
  79,43,Wherein are you (concerned) with the Reminding of it
  79,44,To your Lord is the ultimate (knowledge) of it
  79,45,Surely you are only the warner of him who is apprehensive of it
  79,46,"It will be as if, on the Day they see it, they have not lingered except for a nightfall or its forenoon"
