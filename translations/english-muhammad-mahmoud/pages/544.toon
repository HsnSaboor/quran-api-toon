quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  58,12,"O you who have believed, when you confer privately with the Messenger, then before (Literally: between the two hands (of) your private conference with him, forward a donation; that is more charitable for you and purer. Yet if you do not find (any means), then surely Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
  58,13,"D you (feel) timorous about forwarding donations before (Literally: between the two hands (of) your private conference? So, as you did not perform accordingly, and Allah has relented on you, then keep up the prayer, and bring the Zakat, (i.e., pay the door-dues) and obey Allah and His Messenger; and Allah is Ever-Cognizant of whatever you do"

  58,19,"Ash-Shaytan (The ever ) has gained a privilege over them; so he caused them to forget the Remembrance of Allah; those are Ash-Shaytan's party. Verily, Ash-Shaytan's party are (they) surely they, who are the losers"
