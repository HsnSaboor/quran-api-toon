quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,32,"(The ones) who waxed proud will say to (the ones) who were deemed weak, \"Did we bar you from the guidance after it came to you? No indeed, (but) you were criminals"
  34,33,"And (the ones) who were deemed weak will say to (the ones) who waxed proud, \"No indeed, (but) (it was your) scheming night and day-time as you commanded us to disbelieve in Allah and make up compeers to Him.\" And they will keep secret (their) remorse as soon as they see the torment. And We made shackles on the necks of the ones who disbelieved; will they be recompensed except for whatever they were doing"
  34,34,"And in no way did We send into any town any constant warner except that its population living in ease and luxury said, \"Surely we are disbelievers in what you have been sent with"
  34,35,"And they said, \"We are more (than you) in riches and children, and in no way will we be tormented"
  34,36,"Say, \"Surely my Lord outspreads the provision for whomever He decides and estimates (it); but most of mankind do not know it"
  34,37,"And in no way will your riches, nor your children, bring you in proximity of Our Providence except for him who believes and does righteousness. So, those will have the double recompense for what they did, and they will be in (lofty) compartments secure"
  34,38,"And (the ones) who endeavor against Our signs trying to defy them, those will be presented forward into the torment"
  34,39,"Say, \"Surely my Lord outspreads the provision for whomever He decides of His bondmen and He estimates (it) for him; and whatever thing you expend, He will then replace it. And He is The Most Charitable of providers"
