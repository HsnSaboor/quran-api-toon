quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,And (by) the fig and the olive
  95,2,And (by) Tur Sinin (Mount Sinai)
  95,3,"And (by) this devoted (Or: secure, i.e., the city of Makkah) Country"
  95,4,Indeed We already created man in the fairest stature
  95,5,Thereafter We turned him back to the basest of the base
  95,6,Except the ones who have believed and done deeds of righteousness; so (these) will have a reward bountifully unfailing
  95,7,"Then what will cry you lies hereafter as to the Doom? (Or: the Religion)"
  95,8,Is not Allah The Most Judicious of Judges
  96,1,"Read: In the Name of your Lord Who created"
  96,2,Created man from clots
  96,3,"Read: And your Lord is The Most Honorable"
  96,4,Who taught by the pen
  96,5,He taught man what he did not know
  96,6,Not at all! Surely man does indeed (grow) inordinate
  96,7,That he sees himself becoming self-sufficient
  96,8,Surely to your Lord is the Returning
  96,9,Have you seen him who forbids
  96,10,A bondman when he prays
  96,11,Have you seen in case he is upon guidance
  96,12,Or he commands (people) to piety
  96,13,Have you seen in case he cries lies and turns away
  96,14,Does he not know that Allah sees
  96,15,"Not at all! Indeed in case he does not refrain, We will indeed trail him by the forelock"
  96,16,"A lying, sinful forelock"
  96,17,So let him call upon his assembly
  96,18,We will call upon the guards of Hell
  96,19,"Not at all! Do not obey him, and prostrate yourself, and draw near (to Allah)"
