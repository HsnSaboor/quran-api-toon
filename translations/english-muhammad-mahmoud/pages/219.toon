quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,89,"Said He, \"Your invocation (i.e., of both Musa and H?arun) has been answered; so go you (two) straight and definitely do not ever follow the way of the ones who do not know"
  10,90,"And We made the Seeds (Or: sons) of Israel) pass over the sea; then Firaawn and his hosts followed them up inequitably and aggressively till, when the drowning overtook him, he said, \"I believe that there is no god except He in Whom the Seeds of believe, and I am one of the Muslims"
  10,91,"Do you (believe) now? And before (that) you readily disobeyed, and you were (one) of the corruptors"
  10,92,So today We will (safely) deliver you with your body that you may be a sign to the ones succeeding you; and surely many among mankind are indeed heedless of Our signs
  10,93,"And indeed We readily located the Seeds (Or: sons) of Israel) in an agreeable (Literally: a location of sincerity) location, and We provided them with (many) of the good things. Then in no way did they differ (among them-selves) until the knowledge came to them. Surely your Lord will decree between them on the Day of the Resurrection concerning (the things) wherein they used to differ"
  10,94,"So, in case you are in doubt regarding what We have sent down to you, then ask the ones who read the Book even before you. Indeed the Truth has already come to you from your Lord, so do not definitely be of the constant wranglers"
  10,95,And do not definitely be of the ones who have cried lies to the signs of Allah so as to be of the losers
  10,96,Surely the ones against whom the Word of your Lord has come true do not believe
  10,97,"Though every sign may have come to them, till they see the painful torment"
