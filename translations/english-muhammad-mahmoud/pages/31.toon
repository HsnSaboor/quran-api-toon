quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,197,"The Pilgrimage is (in) months well-known; so, whoever ordains (upon himself) the Pilgrimage in them, then there shall be no lying with (womenfolk), nor evident immorality, nor disputing in the Pilgrimage. And whatever charity you perform, Allah knows it. And sustain yourselves; so, the most charitable sustenance is piety; and be pious to Me, O (you) endowed with intellects"
  2,198,"It is no fault in you that you constantly seek Grace from your Lord; so when you press on from Arafat, then remember Allah at the Inviolable Emblem, and remember Him as He has guided you, and decidedly you were even before it (i.e. before Islam) indeed of the erring"
  2,199,"Thereafter, press on from where the multitude (Literally: mankind) press on, and ask for forgiveness from Allah; surely Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful"
  2,200,"So, when you have accomplished your (holy) rituals, then remember Allah like the remembrance of your fathers (The pagan Arabs used to praise their forefathers at the conclusion of the pilgrimage) or (even) with stronger fervor in remembrance. So, of mankind (there are) some who say, \"Our Lord, bring us (provision) in the present (life), \" and in no way does he have any share in the Hereafter"
  2,201,"And of them are (some) who say, \"Our Lord, bring us in the (present) life a fair (reward), and in the Hereafter a fair (reward), and protect us from the torment of the Fire"
  2,202,"Those will have an assignment from whatever they have earned, and Allah is swift at the reckoning"
