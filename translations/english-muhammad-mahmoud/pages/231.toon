quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,82,"So as soon as Our Command came, We turned it upside-down (Literally: We made its highest lowest) and rained on it stones of baked clay tiered, (one on another)"
  11,83,"Marked from the Providence of your Lord, and in no way is it far from the unjust (ones)"
  11,84,"And to Madyan (We sent) their brother Shuaayb. He said, \"O my people, worship Allah! In no way do you have any god other than He. And do not diminish the measuring and the balance. Surely I see you are in charitable (circumstances); and surely I fear for you the torment of an encompassing Day"
  11,85,"And my people, fill up the measuring and the balance with equity and do not depreciate the things of mankind, and do not perpetrate (mischief) in the land as corruptors"
  11,86,"The remainder of Allah is most charitable for you, in case you are believers; and in no way am I a constant preserver over you"
  11,87,"They said, \"O Shuaayb, does your prayer command you that we should leave what our fathers worshiped, or (leave) performing as we decide with our riches? Surely you are indeed the one who is the most-forbearing, the (most) right-minded"
  11,88,"He said, \"O my people, have you seen (that) in case I (rely) on Supreme evidence from my Lord and He has provided me with fair provision from Him (should i corrupt it)? And in no way would I like to differ from you (and do) whatever I forbid you (to do). Decidedly I would (do) nothing except reformation, (i.e., acting righteously) so far as I am able to. And in no way is my success with anyone except with Allah; in Him I have put my trust, and to Him I turn penitent"
