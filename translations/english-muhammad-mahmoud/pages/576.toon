quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,Surely he did think and he determined
  74,19,"So, may he be slain, how he determined"
  74,20,"Again, (Literally: Thereafter) may he be slain, how he determined"
  74,21,Thereafter he looked (round)
  74,22,"Thereafter he frowned, and he scowled"
  74,23,"Thereafter he withdrew, and he waxed proud"
  74,24,"So he said, \"Decidedly this is nothing except sorcery, transmitted relics"
  74,25,Decidedly this is nothing except the speech of mortals
  74,26,I shall soon roast him in Saqar
  74,27,And what makes you realize what Saqar is
  74,28,"It neither spares (i.e., no survivors remain) nor leaves (anything) behind"
  74,29,Shriveling mortals
  74,30,Over it are nineteen
  74,31,"And in no way have We made the Wardens (Literally: companions) of the Fire except Angels, and in no way have We made their (right) number except as a temptation for the ones who have disbelieved, (and) that the ones to whom the Book has been brought may have certitude, and that the ones who have believed may increase in belief, and that the ones to whom the Book has been brought and the believers may not be suspicious, and that the ones in whose hearts there is sickness and the disbelievers may say, \"What would Allah intend by this as a similitude?\" Thus does Allah lead into error whomever He decides, and He guides whomever He decides, and in no way does anyone know the hosts of your Lord except He. And in no way is it anything except a Reminding to the mortals"
  74,32,Not at all! And (by) the moon
  74,33,And the night as it with draws
  74,34,And the morning when it shines (forth)
  74,35,Surely it is indeed one of the greatest things
  74,36,As a warning to mortals
  74,37,"To whomever of you who decides to go forward or postpone (i.e., performing righteous deeds or falling into evil)"
  74,38,Every self will be pledged for whatever it has earned
  74,39,Except the companions of the Right
  74,40,In Gardens they will ask one another (questions)
  74,41,Concerning the criminals
  74,42,What inserted you into Saqar
  74,43,"They will say, \"We were not of the ones who prayed"
  74,44,And we did not feed the indigent
  74,45,"And we used to wade with the waders, (i.e., wade in vaintalk)"
  74,46,And we used to cry lies to the Day of Doom
  74,47,Until the Certitude came up to us
