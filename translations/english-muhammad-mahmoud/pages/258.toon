quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  14,19,"Have you not seen that Allah created the heavens and the earth with the Truth? In case He (so) decides, He can put you away and come up with a new creation"
  14,20,"And in no way is that a mighty (thing) for Allah (i.e., It is not difficult for Him)"
  14,21,"And they go forth to Allah altogether.

Equal it is for us whether we (endure) impatiently, or whether we endure patiently; in no way can we have any evasion"
  14,22,"And Ash-Shaytan (The all-vicious \"one\", i.e., the Devil) says, as soon as the Command is decreed, \"Surely Allah promised you a promise of Truth, and I promised you, then I failed you; and in no way did I have any all-binding authority over you except that I called you, so you responded to me. So do not blame me and blame yourselves. In no way can I be a screamer (i.e., able to every for help for you) for you, and in no way can you be screamers for me. Surely I disbelieved in your associating me (with Allah) earlier.\" Surely the unjust will have a painful torment"
