quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He (The prophet) frowned and turned away
  80,2,That the blind man came to him
  80,3,And what makes you (The prophet) realize whether he (The blind man (Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum) would possibly (try) to cleanse himself
  80,4,"Or that he would constantly remember, and the Reminding would profit him"
  80,5,(But) as for him who thinks himself self- sufficient
  80,6,To him then you (are eager) to attend
  80,7,And in no way is it up to you (if) he should not (try to) cleanse himself
  80,8,And as for him who has come to you endeavoring (to cleanse himself)
  80,9,And he is apprehensive (of his Lord)
  80,10,Then of him you were being unmindful
  80,11,Not at all! Surely it is a Reminder
  80,12,"So, whoever decides will remember it"
  80,13,(It is) in Scrolls high-honored
  80,14,"Upraised, purified"
  80,15,By the hands of (serene) Scribes
  80,16,"Honorable, benign"
  80,17,Slain be man! How disbelieving he is
  80,18,Of whichever thing did He create him
  80,19,Of a sperm drop He created him; so He determined him
  80,20,Thereafter the way He eased for him
  80,21,"Thereafter He makes him to die, so He entombs him"
  80,22,"Thereafter when He (so) decides, He makes him rise again"
  80,23,Not at all! (Man) has not as yet performed what He has commanded him
  80,24,"So, let (man) look into his food"
  80,25,"(For) that We poured water in abundance, (Literally: with abundant pouring)"
  80,26,"Thereafter We clove the earth in fissures, (Literally: in cloven \"fissures)"
  80,27,"So, therein We caused (the) grain to grow"
  80,28,"And vines, and clover, (Or: reeds)"
  80,29,And olives and palm trees
  80,30,And enclosed orchards with dense trees
  80,31,"And fruits, and grass, (Or: fodder)"
  80,32,"An enjoyment for you and your cattle (includes cattle, camels, sheep and goats)"
  80,33,Then when the Blast comes
  80,34,On the Day when a person will flee from his brother
  80,35,"And his mother, and his father"
  80,36,"And his female companion, and his seeds, (Or: sons)"
  80,37,Upon that Day every (single) person of them will have an affair that will preoccupy him
  80,38,(Some) faces upon that Day will be shining
  80,39,"Laughing, (happy) at the glad tidings"
  80,40,And (some) faces upon that Day will be (covered) by resentment
  80,41,Oppressed by gloom
  80,42,"Those are they (who) are the persistent, impious disbelievers"
