quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,135,"O you who have believed, be constantly upright with equity (with others), witnesses for Allah, even if it be against yourselves or (your) parents and nearest kin. In case (the person) is rich or poor, then Allah is the Best Patron for both. So do not ever follow prejudice, so as to do justice; and in case you twist or veer away, then surely Allah has been Ever-Cognizant of whatever you do"
  4,136,"O you who have believed, believe in Allah and His Messenger, and the Book which He has been sending down on His Messenger, and the Book which He sent down earlier. And whoever disbelieves in Allah, and His Angels, and His Books, and His Messengers, and the Last Day, then he has readily erred into far error"
  4,137,"Surely (the ones) who believed, thereafter disbelieved, thereafter believed, thereafter disbelieved, thereafter increased in disbelief- Allah indeed is not (going) to forgive them nor is He indeed (going) to guide them on a way"
  4,138,Give (good) tidings to the hypocrites that they will have a painful torment
  4,139,"(The ones) who take to themselves the disbelievers for their constant patrons, apart from the believers; do they (inequitably) seek might in their presence? Then surely might altogether belongs to Allah"
  4,140,"And He has already been sending down upon you in the Book that, \"When you hear the signs of Allah being disbelieved and mocked at, then do not sit with them until they wade into (i.e., take up \"a subject\") (some) other discourse; surely (in that case) you are like them. Surely Allah will be gathering the hypocrites and the disbelievers altogether in Hell"
