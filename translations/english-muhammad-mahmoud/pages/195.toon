quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,48,"Indeed they inequitably sought (to stir up) sedition already earlier and turned the commands about for you, until the Truth came, and the Command of Allah became topmost, and they are hating (that)"
  9,49,"And of them is he who says, \"Give me permission (i.e., permission to be excused from fighting) and do not tempt me.\" Verily they have already fallen down into temptation; and surely Hell is indeed encompassing the disbelievers"
  9,50,"In case a fair (reward) alights (Literally: afflicts) on you, (i.e., the prophet) it vexes them; and in case an affliction afflicts you, they say, \"We took our command (in hand) earlier, \" and turn away, and they (feel) exultant"
  9,51,"Say, \"Never will anything afflict us except what Allah has prescribed for us; He is our Supreme Patronizer; and on Allah let the believers then put their trust"
  9,52,"Say, \"Are you awaiting for us (anything) except one of the two fairest rewards? (i.e., martyrdom or victory) And we are awaiting for you that Allah will afflict you with a torment from His (providence) or at our hands. So await; surely we are awaiting with you"
  9,53,"Say, \"Expend, willingly or unwillingly, it will never be (graciously) accepted from you; surely you have been an immoral people"
  9,54,"And nothing has prevented that their expendings should be accepted from them except that they have disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger, and they do not come up to prayer except lazily, and they do not expend except while they are hating (that). (Literally: and they are of that)"
