  6,132,"And all have degrees (according) to what they have done, and in no way is your Lord ever heedless of whatever they do"
  6,133,"And your Lord is The Ever-Affluent, (Literally: The Ever-Rich) The Owner of (the) mercy. In case He decides, He (can) put you away, and cause whatever He decides to succeed even after you, as He brought you from the offspring of another people"
  6,134,Surely whatever you are promised will indeed be coming up (to you); and in no way are you able to be defiant to (Him)

And if Allah had (so) decided, they would not have performed it. So leave them alone with whatever they fabricate"
