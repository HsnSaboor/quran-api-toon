quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  22,73,"O you mankind, a similitude is struck; so listen to it. Surely the ones whom you invoke apart from Allah will never create a fly, even if they gathered together for (the purpose); and in case a fly should rob them of anything, they would not be able to rescue it from him. Weak (indeed) are the seeker and the sought"
  22,74,"In no way have they estimated Allah His true estimation; surely Allah is indeed Ever-Powerful, Ever-Mighty"
  22,75,"Allah elects of the angels Messengers and of mankind; (Messengers); surely Allah is Ever-Hearing, Ever-Beholding"
  22,76,"He knows whatever is before (Literally: between their hands) them and whatever is behind them, and to Allah all Commands are returned"
  22,77,"O you who have believed, bow down, and prostrate yourselves, and worship your Lord, and perform charity that possibly you would prosper. A prostration is to be performed here"
  22,78,"And strive for Allah as is the true striving for Him. He is (The One) Who has selected you, and in no way has (He) made for you (any) restriction in the religion, (being) the creed of your fatherIbrahim (Abraham). He is (The One) Who has named you Muslims earlier and in this (Book) that the Messenger may be a constant witness against you, and that you may be constant witnesses against mankind. So keep up the prayer, and bring the Zakat (i.e., pay the poor-dues) and adhere firmly to Allah; He is your Patronizer; so how favorable is The Patronizer, and how favorable is The Ready Vindicator"
