quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,31,"Being unswervingly upright towards Allah, without associating with Him (anything). And whoever associates with Allah (anything), then it is as though he has collapsed from the heaven, so the birds snatch him away, or the wind sweeps down with him into a far-off place"
  22,32,"That (is the Command); and whoever (constantly) magnifies the waymarks of Allah, then surely it is of the piety of the hearts"
  22,33,"Therein are benefits for you to a stated term; thereafter their lawful destination (i.e., for sacrifice) is by the Ancient House"
  22,34,And for every nation We have made a ritual that they may mention the Name of Allah over such brute cattle (Ancam includes) as He has provided them. So your God is One God; then to Him surrender and give good tidings to the venerating ones
  22,35,"Who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts are tremulous, and the patient ones (in face) of whatever afflicts them, and the ones keeping up the prayer and (who) expend of whatever We have provided them"
  22,36,"And the fleshy cattle, We have made them for you as among the waymarks of Allah; therein is charity for you. So mention The Name of Allah over them, (standing) in ranks. So, when their sides (i.e., flanks) are (properly) readied, (Or: collapse, fall) then eat of them, and feed the contented poor and the suppliant. Thus We have subjected them to you that possibly you would thank (Me)"
  22,37,"Their meats will never attain pertain to Allah, nor their blood; (Literally: bloods) but piety from you will reach Him. Thus He has subjected them to you, that you may magnify Allah for that He has guided you. And give good tidings to the fair-doers"
  22,38,"Surely Allah defends the ones who have believed; surely Allah does not love any most treacherous, most disbelieving person"
