  10,44,"Surely Allah does not do injustice to mankind in anything, but mankind do injustice to themselves"
  10,45,"And the Day He will muster them (it will be) as if they had not lingered except an hour of the daytime, getting (mutually) acquainted; already lost are the ones who cried lies to the meeting with Allah, and in no way are they rightly guided"
  10,46,"And whether We definitely show you something (i.e., some form of punishment) of what We promise them, or We definitely take you up to Us, then to Us will be their return; thereafter Allah is Ever-Witnessing over whatever they perform"
  10,47,"And for every nation there is a Messenger, so when their Messenger comes, (the case) is decreed between them with equity, and they are not done an injustice"
  10,48,"And they say, \"When is this promise, in case you are sincere"
  10,49,"Say, \"I do not possess (any means for) harm or profit for myself, excepting whatever Allah decides. To every nation is a term; when their term comes they will not be able to postpone it by a (single) hour, nor will they be able put it forward"
  10,50,"Say, \"Have you seen (that), in case His torment comes up to you at night (Or in their homes) or day-time, what is there of it that the criminals seek to hasten"
  10,51,"Is it (only) thereafter, when it befalls, that you will believe in it? Do (you believe) now? And already you were seeking to hasten it"
  10,52,"Thereafter it will be said to the ones who did injustice, \"Taste the torment of eternity! Are you recompensed anything except for what you were earning"
  10,53,"And they ask you to inform them, \"Is it true?\" Say, \"Yea, by my Lord! Surely it is true indeed; and in no way can you be defiant to (Him)"
