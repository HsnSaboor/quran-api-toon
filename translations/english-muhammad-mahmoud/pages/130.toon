  6,19,"Say, \"Which thing is greatest in testimony?\" Say, \" Allah is Ever- Witnessing between me and you; and this Qur'an has been revealed to me to warn you thereby and whomever it reaches.\" Do you surely bear witness indeed that there are other gods with Allah?\" Say, \"I do not bear witness.\" Say, \"Surely He is only One God, and surely I (myself) am quit of whatever you associate (with Him)"
  6,20,"The ones to whom We have brought the Book recognize it (just) as they recognize their sons. The ones who lost their (own) selves, so they do not believe"
  6,21,"And who is more unjust than he who fabricates against Allah a lie, or cries lies to His signs? Sure it is that the unjust will not prosper"
  6,22,"And on the Day We muster them altogether, thereafter We say to the ones who associated (other gods with Allah), \"Where are your associates whom you were asserting"

  6,27,"And if you could see (them) as they are made to stand against the Fire, so they say, \"Oh, would that we might be turned back, and (then) we would not cry lies to the signs of our Lord, and we would be among the believers"
