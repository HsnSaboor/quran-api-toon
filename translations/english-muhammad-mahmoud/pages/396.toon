  28,86,"And in no way did you hope that the Book should be cast to you, except it be a mercy from your Lord; so definitely do not be a backer of the disbelievers"
  28,87,"And definitely do not let them bar you from the ayat (Verses or signs) of Allah after they have been sent down to you. And call to your Lord, and definitely do not be one of the associators (Those who associate others with Allah)"
  28,88,"And do not invoke another god with Allah; there is no god except He. All things perish, except His Face. To Him belongs the Judgment, and to Him you will be returned"
  29,1,"Alif, Lam, Mim (These are the names of letters of Arabic alphabet, and only Allah knows their meaning here)"

  29,6,"And whoever strives, then surely he strives only for himself; surely Allah is indeed (so) Ever-Affluent (as to dispense) with the worlds"
