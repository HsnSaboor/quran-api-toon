quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  31,12,"And We had given Luqmaan the wisdom: \"You shall be thankful to God, and whoever is thankful is being thankful for his own good. As for whosoever rejects, then God is Rich, Praiseworthy"
  31,13,"And Luqmaan said to his son, while he was advising him: \"O my son, do not set up any partners with God; for setting up partners is an immense wrongdoing"
  31,14,"And We enjoined the human being regarding his parents. His mother bore him with hardship upon hardship, and his weaning takes two calendar years. You shall give thanks to Me, and to your parents. To Me is the final destiny"
  31,15,"If they strive to make you set up any partners besides Me, then do not obey them. But continue to treat them amicably in this world. You shall follow only the path of those who have sought Me. Ultimately, you all return to Me, then I will inform you of everything you have done"
  31,16,"O my son, if it be anything even as the weight of a mustard seed, be it deep inside a rock, or be it in the heavens or the Earth, God will bring it. God is Sublime, Expert"
  31,17,"O my son, hold the contact-method and advocate righteousness and forbid evil, and bear with patience whatever befalls you. These are the most honourable traits"
  31,18,"And do not turn your cheek arrogantly from people, nor shall you roam the Earth insolently. For God does not like the arrogant show offs"
  31,19,And be humble in how you walk and lower your voice. For the harshest of all voices is the donkey's voice
