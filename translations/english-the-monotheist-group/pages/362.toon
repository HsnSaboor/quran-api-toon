quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,21,"And those who do not expect to meet Us said: \"If only the Angels were sent down upon him, or that we see our Lord.\" They have become arrogant in their souls, and they have produced a great blasphemy"
  25,22,"On the Day they see the Angels, that is not good news for the criminals. And they will Say: \"Away to a place that is sealed off"
  25,23,"And We turned to the works that they did, and We made it dust in the wind"
  25,24,The dwellers of Paradise on that Day are in the best abode and the best destiny
  25,25,"And the Day when the sky will be filled with clouds, and the Angels will be sent down in succession"
  25,26,The true kingship on that Day will be to the Almighty. And it is a Day which will be very hard on the rejecters
  25,27,"And that Day the wrongdoer will bite on his hand and Say: \"I wish I had taken the path with the messenger"
  25,28,"Woe unto me, I wish I did not take so and so as a friend"
  25,29,"He has misguided me from the remembrance after it came to me, and the devil was always a betrayer of mankind"
  25,30,"And the messenger said: \"My Lord, my people have deserted this Quran"
  25,31,And it is such that We make for every prophet enemies from among the criminals. And your Lord suffices as a Guide and a Victor
  25,32,"And those who rejected said: \"If only the Quran was sent down to him in one go!\" It was done as such so We could strengthen your heart with it, and We arranged it accordingly"
