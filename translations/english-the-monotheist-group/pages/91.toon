quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,80,"Whoever obeys the messenger has obeyed God; and whoever turns away, We have not sent you as a guardian over them"
  4,81,"And they Say: \"Obedience,\" but when they emerge from you a group of them prepares for other that what you have said, and God records what they planned. So turn away from them and put your trust in God. God is enough for your trust"
  4,82,Do they not reflect on the Quran If it was from any other than God they would have found it very different
  4,83,"And if any matter regarding security, or fear, comes to them they make it publicly known, but if they had referred it to the messenger and to those entrusted from them then it would have been known by those who studied it from them. And had it not been for God's grace upon you and His mercy, you would have followed the devil, except for a few"
  4,84,"So fight in the cause of God; you are not responsible except for yourself. And enjoin the believers: \"Perhaps God will put a stop to the might of those who disbelieved.\" And God is far Mightier and far more Punishing"
  4,85,"Whoever intercedes a good intercession, he will have a reward of it; and whoever intercedes an evil intercession, he will receive a share of it. And God has control over all things"
  4,86,"And if you are greeted with a greeting, then return an even better greeting or return the same. God is Reckoning over all things"
