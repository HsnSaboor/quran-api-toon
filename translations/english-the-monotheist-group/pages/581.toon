quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Did We not create you from a fragile water
  77,21,Then We made it in a place of protection
  77,22,Until a time that is predetermined
  77,23,"So We measured, and We are the best to measure"
  77,24,Woe on that Day to the disbelievers
  77,25,Did We not make the Earth an abode
  77,26,Living and dead
  77,27,"And We made massive stabilizers in it, and We gave you to drink fresh water"
  77,28,Woe on that Day to the disbelievers
  77,29,Away with you towards what you have disbelieved
  77,30,Away with you to a shadow with three columns
  77,31,"Neither does it shade, nor does it avail from the flames"
  77,32,It throws sparks as huge as logs
  77,33,As if they were yellow camels
  77,34,Woe on that Day to the disbelievers
  77,35,This is a Day when they shall not speak
  77,36,Nor will it be permitted for them so they can make excuses
  77,37,Woe on that Day to the disbelievers
  77,38,This is the Day of Separation where We have gathered you with the ancient people
  77,39,"So if you have a scheme, then make use of it"
  77,40,Woe on that Day to the disbelievers
  77,41,The righteous are among shades and springs
  77,42,And fruit from what they desire
  77,43,Eat and drink comfortably for what you used to do
  77,44,It is such that We reward the good doers
  77,45,Woe on that Day to the disbelievers
  77,46,"Eat and enjoy for a little while, for you are criminals"
  77,47,Woe on that Day to the disbelievers
  77,48,"And when they are told to kneel, they do not kneel"
  77,49,Woe on that Day to the disbelievers
  77,50,So in what words after this will they believe
