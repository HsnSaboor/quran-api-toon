  47,13,"And many a town was stronger than your own town, which drove you out. We destroyed them, and there was none who could help them"

  47,15,"Is the example of Paradise; that the righteous have been promised with rivers of pure water, and rivers of milk whose taste does not change, and rivers of wine that are delicious for the drinkers, and rivers of strained honey, and for them in it are all kinds of fruits, and a forgiveness from their Lord; like that of those who abide in the Fire, and are given to drink boiling water that cuts-up their intestines"
  47,16,"And some of them listen to you, until when they go out from you, they say to those who have been given the knowledge: \"What did he say\" Those are the ones whom God has sealed upon their hearts, and they followed their desires"
  47,17,"And those who are guided, He increases their guidance, and grants them their righteousness"
