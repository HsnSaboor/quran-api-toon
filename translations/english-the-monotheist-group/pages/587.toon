quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When the sky is damaged
  82,2,And when the planets are scattered
  82,3,And when the seas burst
  82,4,And when the graves are laid open
  82,5,Then the soul will know what it has brought forth and what it has left behind
  82,6,"O man, what has turned you arrogant against your Lord, the Most Generous"
  82,7,"The One who created you, then evolved you, then made you upright"
  82,8,"In any which picture He chooses, He places you"
  82,9,"No, you are but deniers of the system"
  82,10,And over you are those who watch
  82,11,Honourable scribes
  82,12,They know what you do
  82,13,The pious are in Paradise
  82,14,And the wicked are in Hell
  82,15,They will enter it on the Day of recompense
  82,16,And they will not be absent from it
  82,17,And do you know what is the Day of recompense
  82,18,"Then again, do you know what is the Day of recompense"
  82,19,"The Day when no soul possesses anything for any other soul, and the decision on that Day is to God"
  83,1,Woe to those who short change
  83,2,"Those who when they are receiving any measure from the people, they take it in full"
  83,3,"And when they are the ones giving measure or weight, they give less than due"
  83,4,Do these not assume that they will be resurrected
  83,5,To a great Day
  83,6,The Day mankind will stand before the Lord of the worlds
