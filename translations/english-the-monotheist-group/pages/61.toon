  3,84,"Say: \"We believe in God and what was sent down to us and what was sent down to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Patriarchs, and what was given to Moses and Jesus and the prophets from their Lord. We do not make any distinction between them, and to Him we surrender"

  3,88,"Eternally they will abide in it, the retribution will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved"
  3,89,"Except those who repent after this and make amends, then God is Forgiver, Merciful"
  3,90,"Those who have rejected after their belief then increased in rejection, their repentance will not be accepted, they are the strayers"
