  26,40,Perhaps we can follow the magicians if they are the winners
  26,41,"So when the magicians came, they said to Pharaoh: \"We should be rewarded if we are the winners"
  26,42,"He said: \"Yes, and you shall also be near to me"
  26,43,"Moses said to them: \"Cast down what it is you will cast"
  26,44,"So they cast down their ropes and staffs and they said: \"By the might of Pharaoh, we will be the winners"
  26,45,"So Moses cast down his staff, then it was eating-up all that they showed"
  26,46,So the magicians went down prostrating
  26,47,"They said: \"We believe in the lord of the worlds"
  26,48,The Lord of Moses and Aaron
  26,49,"He said: \"Have you believed to him before I permitted you He is surely your great one who has taught you magic. So you shall come to know. I will cut-off your hands and feet from alternate sides, and I will crucify you all"
  26,50,"They said: \"There is no worry, for we are all returning to our Lord"
  26,51,"We hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins, as we are the first to believe"
  26,52,"And We inspired Moses: \"Take away My servants, for you will be followed"
  26,53,So Pharaoh sent gatherers to the cities
  26,54,These are but a small band
  26,55,And they have done what has enraged us
  26,56,And We are all gathered and forewarned
  26,57,"So, We evicted them out of gardens and springs"
  26,58,And treasures and an honourable dwelling
  26,59,"As such, We gave it to the Children of Israel"
  26,60,So they were pursued at sunrise
