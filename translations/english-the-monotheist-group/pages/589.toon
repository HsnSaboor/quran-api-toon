quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,Upon the luxurious furnishings they are observing
  83,36,Have the rejecters been paid for what they used to do
  84,1,When the sky is torn
  84,2,"And it allowed its Lord, and was ready"
  84,3,And when the land is stretched
  84,4,And it spits out what is in it and becomes empty
  84,5,"And it permits its Lord, and is ready"
  84,6,"O man, you will be returning to your Lord with your actions and meeting Him"
  84,7,So whoever is given his record in his right
  84,8,He will then receive an easy reckoning
  84,9,And he will return to his family in joy
  84,10,And as for he who is given his record behind his back
  84,11,He will invoke his destruction
  84,12,And he will enter a blazing Fire
  84,13,He was with his people in joy
  84,14,He thought he would not be returned
  84,15,"No, He is ever seeing of him"
  84,16,"So, I swear by the redness of dusk"
  84,17,And the night and what it is driven on
  84,18,And the moon when it is full
  84,19,You will ride a vessel upon a vessel
  84,20,So what is the matter with them that they do not believe
  84,21,"And when the Quran is being related to them, they do not prostrate"
  84,22,"No, those who have rejected are in denial"
  84,23,And God is more aware of what they gather
  84,24,So inform them of a painful retribution
  84,25,"Except for those who believe and do good works, they will have a reward that will not end"
