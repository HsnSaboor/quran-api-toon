quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,23,"Nor will intercession be of any help with Him, except for whom He has already given leave. Until when the fear has subsided from their hearts, they ask: \"What did your Lord say\" They will Say: \"The truth!\" And He is the Most High, the Great"
  34,24,"Say: \"Who provides for you from the heavens and the Earth\" Say: \"God! And either we or you are guided, or are clearly astray"
  34,25,"Say: \"You will not be asked about our crimes, nor will we be asked for what you do"
  34,26,"Say: \"Our Lord will gather us together then He will judge between us with truth. He is the Judge, the Knowledgeable"
  34,27,"Say: \"Show me those whom you have set up as partners with Him! No; He is but God, the Noble, the Wise"
  34,28,"And We have sent you to all people to be a bearer of good news, as well as a warner; but most people do not know"
  34,29,"And they Say: \"When is this promise, if you are truthful"
  34,30,"Say: \"You have an appointed day, which you cannot delay by one hour, nor advance"
  34,31,"And those who rejected have said: \"We will not believe in this Quran, nor in what is already with him.\" And if you could but see these transgressors when they stand before their Lord, how they will accuse one another back and forth. Those who were weak will say to those who were mighty: \"If it were not for you, we would have been believers"
