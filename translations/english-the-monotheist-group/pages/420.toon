quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  33,16,"Say: \"It will not benefit you to flee away from death or from being killed, for you will only have the enjoyment for a short while"
  33,17,"Say: \"Who can protect you from God if He intends to harm you, or He intends any blessing for you\" They will never find besides God any ally or victor"
  33,18,"God already knows which of you are the hinderers, and those who say to their brothers: \"Come and stay with us.\" Rarely do they mobilize for battle"
  33,19,"They are miserable towards you. Then, when fear comes, you see their eyes rolling, as if death had already come to them. But once the fear is gone, they lash-out at you with sharp tongues. They are miserable towards doing any good. These have not believed, so God nullifies their works. This is easy for God to do"
  33,20,"They thought that the opponents had not yet mobilized. And if the opponents do appear, they wish that they were out in the desert, seeking out news for you. Even if they were among you, they would not have fought except very little"
  33,21,"Indeed, in the messenger of God a good example has been set for you for he who seeks God and the Last Day and thinks constantly about God"
  33,22,"And when the believers saw the opponents, they said: \"This is what God and His messenger have promised us, and God and His messenger are truthful.\" This only increased their faith and their surrender"
