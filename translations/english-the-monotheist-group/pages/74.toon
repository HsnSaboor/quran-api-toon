quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,181,"God has heard the words of those who said: \"God is poor and we are rich!\" We will record what they have said and their killing of the prophets without just cause; and We will Say: \"Taste the retribution of the Fire"
  3,182,"This is for what their hands have brought forth, and God does not wrong the servants"
  3,183,"Those who said: \"God has pledged to us that we should not believe in a messenger unless he brings us an offering which the fire will not devour.\" Say: \"Messengers have come to you before me with clarity and with what you have said, so why did you kill them if you were truthful"
  3,184,"If they reject you, then messengers before you were also rejected; they came with clarity and the Psalms, and the Scripture of enlightenment"
  3,185,"Every soul will taste death, and you will be recompensed your dues on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is swayed from the Fire and entered into Paradise, he has indeed won. This worldly life is nothing more than the enjoyment of vanity"
  3,186,"We will test you in your wealth and in yourselves, and you will hear from those who have been given the Scripture from before you and from those who set up partners much annoyance"
