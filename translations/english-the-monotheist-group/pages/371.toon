quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,And give me a tongue that is true for those who will follow
  26,85,And make me of the inheritors of the gardens of bliss
  26,86,"And forgive my father, for he was of those misguided"
  26,87,And do not disgrace me on the Day when they are resurrected
  26,88,The Day when no money or children can help
  26,89,Except for he who comes to God with a pure heart
  26,90,And Paradise was made near for the righteous
  26,91,And Hell was displayed for the wrongdoers
  26,92,"And it was said to them: \"Where is what you used to worship"
  26,93,"Without God, can they help you or help themselves"
  26,94,"So they were thrown in it on their faces, them and the wrongdoers"
  26,95,As well as all the soldiers of Satan
  26,96,"They said, while they were disputing therein"
  26,97,"By God, we were clearly misguided"
  26,98,For we equated you with the Lord of the Worlds
  26,99,And none misled us except the criminals
  26,100,So we have none to intercede for us
  26,101,Nor a close friend
  26,102,"If only we could have another chance, we would be among the believers"
  26,103,"In that is a sign, but most of them are not believers"
  26,104,"And your Lord is the Noble, the Merciful"
  26,105,The people of Noah disbelieved the messengers
  26,106,"When their brother Noah said to them: \"Will you not be righteous"
  26,107,I am to you a trustworthy messenger
  26,108,So be aware of God and obey me
  26,109,"And I do not ask you for a wage, for my reward is upon the Lord of the worlds"
  26,110,So be aware of God and obey me
  26,111,"They said: \"Shall we believe to you when the lowest type of people have followed you"
