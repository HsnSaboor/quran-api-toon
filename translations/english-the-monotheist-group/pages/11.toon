  2,71,"He said: \"He says it is a heifer which was never subjugated to plough the land, or water the crops, free from any blemish.\" They said: \"Now you have come with the truth.\" And they slaughtered it, though they had nearly not done so"
  2,72,"And you had murdered a person, then disputed in the matter; God was to bring out what you were keeping secret"
  2,73,"We said: \"Strike him with parts from it.\" It is thus that God brings the dead to life, and He shows you His signs that you may comprehend"
  2,74,"Then your hearts became hardened after that, they became like stone or even harder; but even from the stones there are rivers that burst forth, or from them are those that crack so that the water comes forth, or from them are what fall from the fear of God; God is not unaware of what you do"
  2,75,"Did you expect that they would believe with you, when a group of them had heard God's words then altered them knowingly after having understood"
  2,76,"And when they come across those who believe, they Say: \"We believe!\", and when they are alone with each other they Say: \"Why do you inform them about what God has said to us Then they would use it in argument against us at your Lord. Do you not understand"
