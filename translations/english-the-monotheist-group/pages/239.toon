quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  12,31,"So when she heard of their scheming, she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them, and she gave each one of them a knife. And she said: \"Come out to them,\" so when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hands, and they said: \"God be praised, this is not a human, but a blessed Angel"
  12,32,"She said: \"This is the one whom you blamed me for, and I have seduced him from himself but he refused. And if he does not do as I command him, he will be imprisoned, and he will be one of those disgraced"
  12,33,"He said: \"My Lord, prison is better to me than what they are inviting me to do. And if You do not turn their scheming away from me, I will fall for them and be of the ignorant"
  12,34,"So his Lord responded to him, and He turned away their scheming from him. He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable"
  12,35,"But it appealed to them, even after they had seen the signs, to imprison him until a time"
  12,36,"And with him in the prison entered two young men. One of them said: \"I dreamt that I was pressing wine,\" and the other said: \"I dreamt that I was carrying bread on top of my head, and that the birds were eating from it.\" \"Tell us what this means, for we see that you are of the good doers"
  12,37,"He said: \"There is not any provision of food that will come to you except that I will tell you of its interpretation before it comes. That is from what my Lord has taught me. I have just left the creed of a people who do not believe in God, and they are rejecting the Hereafter"
