quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By time
  103,2,The human is indeed in loss
  103,3,"Except those who believe, do good works, support one another with the truth, and support one another with perseverance"
  104,1,"Woe unto every backbiter, slanderer"
  104,2,Who gathered his wealth and counted it
  104,3,He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal
  104,4,Never! He will be thrown into the Destroyer
  104,5,And do you know what is the Destroyer
  104,6,God's kindled Fire
  104,7,Which reaches the inside of the hearts
  104,8,It will confine them therein
  104,9,In extended columns
  105,1,Have you not seen what your Lord did to the people of the elephant
  105,2,Did He not cause their schemes to go astray
  105,3,And He sent down upon them swarms of birds
  105,4,Striking them with rocks made from hardened clay
  105,5,Until He turned them like devoured hay
