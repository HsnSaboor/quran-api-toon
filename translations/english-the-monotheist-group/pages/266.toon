quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  15,71,"He said: \"Here are my daughters if it is your intention"
  15,72,"By your life, they are in their drunkenness, blundering"
  15,73,So the scream took them at sunrise
  15,74,"Thus We turned it upside down, and rained over them with rocks made from hardened clay"
  15,75,In this are signs for those who see
  15,76,And it was on an established path
  15,77,In that is a sign for the believers
  15,78,And the dwellers of the forest were wicked
  15,79,"So, We sought revenge from them. And they were both on an open plain"
  15,80,And the dwellers of the cavern disbelieved the messengers
  15,81,"And We gave them Our signs, but they turned away from them"
  15,82,And they used to sculpt from the mountains dwellings that were secure

  15,86,"Your Lord is the Creator, the Knower"
  15,87,And We have given you seven of the pairs and the great Quran
  15,88,"So do not linger with your eyes on what We have bestowed upon some couples from them, and do not grieve for them, and lower your wing for the believers"
  15,89,"And Say: \"I am the clarifying warner"
  15,90,As We have sent down on the dividers
