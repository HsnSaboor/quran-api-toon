quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  57,12,"The Day will come when you see the believing men and the believing women with their light radiating around them and to their right. \"Good news is yours today, you will have paradises with flowing rivers, abiding therein. This is the great triumph"
  57,13,"On that Day, the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women will say to those who believed: \"Wait for us! Let us absorb some of your light.\" It will be said: \"Go back behind you, and seek light.\" So a barrier will be set up between them, whose gate separates mercy on the inner side, from retribution on the outer side"
  57,14,"They will call upon them: \"Were we not with you\" They will reply: \"Yes, but you led yourselves into temptation, and you hesitated, and doubted, and became misled by wishful thinking, until God's judgment came. You were diverted from God by arrogance"
  57,15,"This Day, no ransom can be taken from you, nor from those who disbelieved. Your abode is the Fire, it is your patron; what a miserable abode"
  57,16,"Has not the time come for those who believed to open up their hearts for the remembrance of God, and the truth that is revealed herein And they should not be like those who were given the Scripture before, and the waiting became long for them, so their hearts became hardened, and many of them were wicked"
  57,17,"Know that God revives the land after it had died. We have made clear to you the signs, perhaps you may understand"
  57,18,"Surely, the charitable men and charitable women, who have loaned God a loan of goodness, He will multiply their reward, and they will have a generous recompense"
