quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  33,7,"And when We took from the prophets their covenant. And from you, and from Noah, and Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary; We took from them a strong covenant"
  33,8,"So that the truthful may be asked about their truthfulness, and He has prepared for the rejecters a painful retribution"
  33,9,"O you who believe, remember God's favour upon you when soldiers attacked you and We sent upon them a wind and invisible soldiers. God is Seer of everything you do"
  33,10,"For they came from above you, and from beneath you; and your eyes were terrified, and the hearts reached to the throat, and you harboured doubts about God"
  33,11,That is when the believers were truly tested; they were severely shaken up
  33,12,"And the hypocrites and those who have a sickness in their hearts said: \"God and His messenger promised us nothing but illusions"
  33,13,"And a group of them said: \"O people of Yathrib, you cannot make a stand; therefore, retreat.\" And a small party of them sought permission from the prophet, saying: \"Our homes are exposed,\" while they were not exposed. They just wanted to flee"
  33,14,"And if the enemy had entered at them from all sides, and then they were asked to betray, they would do so with very little hesitation"
  33,15,And indeed they had pledged to God before this that they would not turn around and flee. Making a pledge to God brings great responsibility
