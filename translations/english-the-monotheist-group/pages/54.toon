quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,30,"The Day every soul will find what good it had done present, and what bad it had done; it wishes that between them was a great distance. And God warns you of Himself, and God is Compassionate towards the servants"
  3,31,"Say: \"If you love God then follow me so God will love you and forgive your sins.\" God is Forgiver, Merciful"
  3,32,"Say: \"Obey God and the messenger.\" But if they turn away, then God does not like the rejecters"
  3,33,"God has selected Adam, and Noah, and the family of Abraham, and the family of Imran over the worlds"
  3,34,"A progeny each from the other, and God is Hearer, Knower"
  3,35,"When the wife of Imran said: \"My Lord, I have vowed to You what is in my womb, dedicated, so accept from me, You are the Hearer, the Knower"
  3,36,"So when she delivered she said: \"My Lord, I have delivered a female,\" and God is fully aware of what she delivered, \"And the male is not like the female, and I have named her Mary, and I seek refuge for her and her progeny with You from the outcast devil"
  3,37,"So her Lord accepted her a good acceptance, and made her grow into a good growth, and charged Zachariah with her. Every time Zachariah entered upon her in the temple enclosure, he found provisions with her. He said: \"O Mary, from where did you get this\" She said: \"It is from God, God provides for whom He wishes without reckoning"
