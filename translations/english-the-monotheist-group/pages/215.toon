quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,54,"And if every soul that wronged had possessed all that is on Earth, it would have attempted to ransom it. And they declared their regret when they saw the retribution, and it was judged between them with fairness. They were not wronged"
  10,55,"To God is what is in the heavens and the Earth. God's promise is true, but most of them do not know"
  10,56,"He gives life, and He brings death, and to Him you will return"
  10,57,"O mankind, advice has come to you from your Lord and a remedy for what is in the chests, and a guidance and mercy for the believers"
  10,58,"Say: \"By God's grace and His mercy.\" For that let them rejoice, that is better than all that they gather"
  10,59,"Say: \"Have you seen what God has sent down to you from provisions, then you made some of it forbidden and some lawful\" Say: \"Did God authorize you, or did you invent lies against God"
  10,60,"And what will those who invent lies against God think on the Day of Resurrection God is with great bounty to mankind, but most of them are not thankful"
  10,61,"And any matter you are in, or any recitation you do of the Quran, or any work you do; We are witnesses over you when you undertake it. Nothing is hidden from your Lord, not even an atoms weight on Earth or in the heavens, nor smaller than that nor larger, but is in a clear record"
