quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,And Our commands are done at once with the blink of an eye
  54,51,And We have destroyed your counterparts. Do any of you wish to learn
  54,52,And everything they did is in the records
  54,53,"And everything, small or large, is written down"
  54,54,The righteous will be in paradises and rivers
  54,55,"In a position of honour, at an Omnipotent King"
  55,1,The Almighty
  55,2,Teacher of the Quran
  55,3,Creator of the human being
  55,4,He taught him how to distinguish
  55,5,The sun and the moon are perfectly calculated
  55,6,And the stars and the trees submit
  55,7,And He raised the sky and He established the balance
  55,8,Do not transgress in the balance
  55,9,"And observe the weight with equity, and do not fall short in the balance"
  55,10,And the Earth He has made for all creatures
  55,11,"In it are fruits, and date palms with their hanging fruit"
  55,12,And grains and the spices
  55,13,So which of your Lord's favours will you deny
  55,14,"He created the human from a clay, like pottery"
  55,15,And the Jinn He created from a smokeless fire
  55,16,So which of your Lord's favours will you deny
