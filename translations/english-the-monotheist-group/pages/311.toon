quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Did you see the one who rejected Our revelations and said: \"I will be given wealth and children"
  19,78,Did he look into the future Or has he taken a pledge with the Almighty
  19,79,"No, We will record what he says, and We will increase for him the retribution significantly"
  19,80,"Then We inherit from him all that he said, and he shall come to Us all alone"
  19,81,And they have taken gods besides God to be for them their glory
  19,82,"On the contrary, they will reject their service of them and they will be standing against them"
  19,83,Did you not see that We send the devils upon the rejecters to drive them into evil
  19,84,So do not be impatient; for We are preparing for them a preparation
  19,85,The Day We gather the righteous to the Almighty as a delegation
  19,86,And We drive the criminals to Hell as a herd
  19,87,"None will posses intercession, except for he who has taken a pledge with the Almighty"
  19,88,And they said the Almighty has taken a son
  19,89,You have come with a gross blasphemy
  19,90,"The heavens are about to shatter from it, and the Earth crack open, and the mountains fall and crumble"
  19,91,That they claimed that the Almighty had a son
  19,92,And what need does the Almighty have to take a son
  19,93,When all there is in the heavens and the Earth will but come to the Almighty as servants
  19,94,"He has encompassed them, and counted them one by one"
  19,95,"And all of them will come to Him on the Day of Resurrection, all alone"
