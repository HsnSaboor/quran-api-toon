quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,43,"No nation can hasten its appointed time, nor can it delay"
  23,44,"Then We sent Our messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation their messenger, they denied him. So We made them follow one another, and We made them history. So away with a people who do not believe"
  23,45,Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and a clear authority
  23,46,"To Pharaoh and his leaders. But they became arrogant, for they were a high and mighty people"
  23,47,"So they said: \"Shall we believe to two humans like us, while their people are servants to us"
  23,48,"So they denied them, and they became of those who were destroyed"
  23,49,"And We have given Moses the Scripture, so that they may be guided"
  23,50,"And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and We gave them refuge on high ground, a place for resting and with a flowing stream"
  23,51,"O messengers, eat from what is good, and do righteous work. I am aware of what you do"
  23,52,"And this is your nation, one nation, and I am your Lord so be aware"
  23,53,But the affair was disputed between them into segments. Every group happy with what it had
  23,54,So leave them in their error until a time
  23,55,Do they not think why We are extending them with wealth and children
  23,56,We are quick to give them the good things. But they do not perceive
  23,57,As for those who are in reverence from the awareness of their Lord
  23,58,And they believe in the revelations of their Lord
  23,59,And they do not set up anything with their Lord
