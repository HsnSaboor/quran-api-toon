quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,"When they see it, the criminal will wish he can ransom his children against the retribution"
  70,12,As well as his mate and his brother
  70,13,As well as his whole clan that protected him
  70,14,"And all who are on Earth, so that he can be saved"
  70,15,"No, it is a flame"
  70,16,Eager to roast
  70,17,It calls on those who turned away
  70,18,And who hoarded and counted
  70,19,"Indeed, mankind was created anxious"
  70,20,When adversity touches him he is miserable
  70,21,And when good touches him he is stingy
  70,22,Except for those who reach out
  70,23,Who are always maintaining their contact-method
  70,24,And those who set aside part of their wealth
  70,25,For the seeker and the denied
  70,26,And those who believe in the Day of Judgment
  70,27,And those who are fearful of their Lord's retribution
  70,28,The retribution of their Lord is not to be taken for granted
  70,29,And those who conceal their private parts
  70,30,"Except around their spouses or those committed to by oath, there is no blame"
  70,31,"Then, whoever seeks anything beyond this, they are the transgressors"
  70,32,And those who are trustworthy and keep their pledges
  70,33,And those who uphold their testimonies
  70,34,And those who are dedicated to their contact-method
  70,35,They will be honoured in paradises
  70,36,So what is wrong with the rejecters staring at you
  70,37,"From the right and the left, in crowds"
  70,38,Does every one of them hope to enter a paradise of bliss
  70,39,"No, We have created them from what they know"
