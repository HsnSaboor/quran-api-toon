quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun implodes
  81,2,And when the stars cannot be seen
  81,3,And when the mountains are made to move
  81,4,And when the reproduction is ended
  81,5,And when the beasts are gathered
  81,6,And when the seas are made to boil
  81,7,And when the souls are paired
  81,8,And when the girl killed in infancy is asked
  81,9,For what crime was she killed
  81,10,And when the records are displayed
  81,11,And when the sky is removed
  81,12,And when Hell is ignited
  81,13,And when Paradise is made near
  81,14,Every soul will know what it had done
  81,15,"So, I swear by the receding stars"
  81,16,Their orbits swept away
  81,17,And the night when it passes
  81,18,And the morning when it breathes
  81,19,It is the saying of an honourable messenger
  81,20,With power and influence from the One of the throne
  81,21,"Obeyed, and trustworthy"
  81,22,And your friend is not crazy
  81,23,And he saw him by the clear horizon
  81,24,And he has no knowledge of the future
  81,25,And it is not the saying of an outcast devil
  81,26,So where will you go
  81,27,It is but a reminder for the worlds
  81,28,For whomever of you wishes to be straight
  81,29,"And you cannot will anything except if God also wills, the Lord of the worlds"
