quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  60,1,"O you who believe, do not take My enemy and your enemy as allies, you extend love to them, even though they have rejected the truth that has come to you. They drive you and the messenger out, simply because you believe in God, your Lord. If you are mobilizing to struggle in My cause, seeking My blessings, then how can you secretly love them I am fully aware of everything you conceal, and what you declare. And whosoever of you does this, then he has gone astray from the right path"
  60,2,"If they encounter you, they treat you as enemies, and they extend their hands and tongues against you to hurt you. They desire you to disbelieve"
  60,3,"Neither your relatives nor your children will benefit you. On the Day of Resurrection, He will separate between you. And God is Seer of everything you do"
  60,4,"There has been a good example set for you by Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people: \"We are innocent from you and what you serve besides God. We have rejected you, and it appears that there shall be animosity and hatred between us and you until you believe in God alone.\" Except for the saying of Abraham to his father: \"I will ask forgiveness for you, but I do not possess any power to protect you from God.\" \"Our Lord, we have put our trust in You, and we turn to You, and to You is the final destiny"
  60,5,"Our Lord, do not let us become a test for those who rejected, and forgive us. Our Lord, You are the Noble, the Wise"
