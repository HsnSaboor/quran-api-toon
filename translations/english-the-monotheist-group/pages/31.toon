quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,197,"The Pilgrimage is in the months which have been appointed. So whosoever decides to perform the Pilgrimage in them, then there shall be no sexual approach, nor vileness, nor baseless argument in the Pilgrimage. And any good that you do, God is aware of it; and bring provisions for yourselves, though the best provision is righteousness; and be aware of Me O people of understanding"
  2,198,"There is no sin upon you to seek goodness from your Lord. So when you disperse from the elevated location, then remember God towards the decree which is restricted, and remember Him as He has guided you, for you were before that straying"
  2,199,"Then you shall disperse from where the people dispersed, and seek God's forgiveness; God is surely Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  2,200,"When you have completed your rites, then remember God as you remember your fathers or even greater. From among the people are those who Say: \"Our Lord, give us from this world!\", but in the Hereafter he has no part"
  2,201,"And some of them Say: \"Our Lord, give us good in this world, and good in the Hereafter, and spare us from the retribution of the Fire"
  2,202,These will have a benefit for what they have gained; and God is quick in judgment
