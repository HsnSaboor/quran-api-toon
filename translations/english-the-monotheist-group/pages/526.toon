quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,As the star collapsed
  53,2,"Your friend was not astray, nor was he deceived"
  53,3,Nor does he speak from personal desire
  53,4,It is a divine inspiration
  53,5,He has been taught by One mighty in power
  53,6,"Free from any defect, he became stable"
  53,7,While he was at the highest horizon
  53,8,Then he drew nearer by moving down
  53,9,Until he became as near as two bow-lengths or nearer
  53,10,He then conveyed the inspiration to His servant what was to be revealed
  53,11,The heart did not invent what it saw
  53,12,Do you doubt him in what he saw
  53,13,"And indeed, he saw him in another descent"
  53,14,At the ultimate point
  53,15,Near it is the eternal Paradise
  53,16,The whole place was overwhelmed
  53,17,"The eyes did not waver, nor go blind"
  53,18,He has seen from the great signs of his Lord
  53,19,Have you considered Allaat and Al-`Uzzah
  53,20,"And Manaat, the third one"
  53,21,"Do you have the males, while He has the females"
  53,22,What a strange distribution
  53,23,"These are but names that you made up, you and your forefathers. God never authorized such. They only follow conjecture, and personal desire, while the guidance has come to them from their Lord"
  53,24,Or shall the human being have what he wishes
  53,25,"To God belongs the Hereafter, and the world"
  53,26,"And there are many Angels in heaven, who have no power to intercede, except after God gives permission for whom He wishes and is satisfied with him"
