  26,62,"He said: \"No, my Lord is with me and He will guide me"
  26,63,"So We inspired to Moses: \"Strike the sea with your staff.\" So it split into two, each side like a great mountain"
  26,64,And We then brought them to the other side
  26,65,And We saved Moses and all those with him
  26,66,Then We drowned the others
  26,67,"In that is a sign, but most of them are not believers"
  26,68,"And your Lord is the Noble, the Merciful"
