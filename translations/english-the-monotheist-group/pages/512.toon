quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  48,10,"Those who pledge allegiance to you, are in-fact pledging allegiance to God; God's hand is above their hands. Those of them who violate such a pledge, are violating it only upon themselves. And whosoever fulfills what he has pledged to God, then He will grant him a great reward"
  48,11,"The Nomads who lagged behind will say to you: \"We were preoccupied with our money and our family, so ask forgiveness for us.\" They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: \"Who then would possess any power for you against God if He wanted harm to afflict you or if He wanted benefit for you\" No, God is fully Aware of everything you do"
  48,12,"Alas, you thought that the messenger and the believers would not return to their families, and this was deemed pleasant in your hearts, and you thought the worst thoughts; you were a wicked people"
  48,13,"Anyone who does not believe in God and His messenger, then We have prepared for the rejecters a Hellfire"
  48,14,"And to God is the sovereignty of the heavens and the Earth. He forgives whomever He wills, and punishes whomever He wills. God is Forgiver, Merciful"
  48,15,"Those who lagged behind will say, when you venture out to collect the spoils: \"Let us follow you!\" They want to change God's words. Say: \"You will not follow us; this is what God has decreed beforehand.\" They will then Say: \"No, you are envious of us.\" Alas, they rarely understood anything"
