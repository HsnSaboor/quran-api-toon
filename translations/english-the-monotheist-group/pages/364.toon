  25,44,"Or do you think that most of them hear or understand They are just like cattle. No, they are worse off"
  25,45,"Did you not see to your Lord how He casts the shadow And if He wished, He could have made it still, then We would have made the sun as a guide to it"
  25,46,Then We retract it to us a simple retraction
  25,47,"And He is the One who made for you the night as a cover, and sleep for resting, and He made the day to move about in"
  25,48,And He is the One who sent the winds as glad tidings between the hands of His mercy. And We sent down from the sky water which is pure
  25,49,So that We can revive a dead land with it and We give to drink to Our creation of many of the livestock and mankind
  25,50,"And We have distributed it amongst them so that they may remember, but most people refuse to be anything but rejecters"
  25,51,"And if We wish, We could send to every town a warner"
  25,52,"So do not obey the rejecters, and strive against them with it in a great striving"
  25,53,And He is the One who merges the two bodies of water. This is fresh and palatable and this is salty and bitter. And He made between them a partition and an inviolable barrier
  25,54,"And He is the One who created a human being from the water, so He made for him blood kin and mates. And your Lord is Capable"
  25,55,And they serve besides God what does not benefit them nor harm them. And the rejecter is always set-against his Lord
