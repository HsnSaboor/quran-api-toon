  6,53,"And it is such that We test them with one another, so that they may Say: \"Are these the ones whom God has blessed from amongst us\" Is God not aware of the thankful"
  6,54,"And if those who believe in Our revelations come to you, then Say: \"Peace be upon you, our Lord has decreed mercy upon Himself, that any of you who commits sin out of ignorance and then repents afterwards and amends, then He is Forgiving, Merciful"
  6,55,"And it is such that We explain the revelations, and make clear the way of the criminals"

  6,57,"Say: \"I am on a clarity from my Lord and you have denied it. I do not have what you hasten towards; the judgment is with God only; He carves out the truth, and He is the best decider"
  6,58,"Say: \"If I had what you were hastening towards, then the matter between us would have been resolved. And God is fully aware of the wicked"
  6,59,"And with Him are the keys to the unseen, none know them except He. And He knows what is in the land and in the sea; and not a leaf falls except with His knowledge; nor a seed in the darkness of the Earth; nor anything moist or anything dry; all is in a clear record"
