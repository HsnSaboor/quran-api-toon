quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  18,16,"So when you withdraw from them and what they serve besides God, seek refuge in the cave, and your Lord will distribute His mercy upon you and prepare for your problem a solution"
  18,17,"And you see the sun when it rises, it visits their cave from the right, and when it sets, it touches them from the left, while they are in an enclosure from it. That is from God's signs. Whomever God guides is the guided one, and whomever He misguides, you will not find for him any ally to lead"
  18,18,"And you would think they are awake while they are asleep. And We turn them on the right-side and on the left-side, and their dog has his legs outstretched in their midst. If you looked upon them you would have run away from them and you would have been filled with terror from them"
  18,19,"And it was thus that We delivered them so they would ask themselves. A speaker from amongst them said: \"How long have you stayed\" They said: \"We stayed a day or part of a day.\" He said: \"Your Lord is surely aware how long you stayed, so send one of you with these stamped coins of yours to the city, and let him see which is the tastiest food, and let him come with a provision of it. And let him be careful and let no one take notice of you"
  18,20,"If they discover you, they will stone you or return you to their creed. Then you will never be successful"
