quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,6,"O you who believe, if you rise to attend the contact-method, then wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads and your feet to the ankles; and if you have had intercourse, then you shall bathe. And if you are ill, or traveling, or you have excreted feces, or you have had sexual contact with the women, and you could not find water, then you shall do ablution from clean soil; you shall wipe your faces and your hands. God does not want to make any hardship over you, but He wants to cleanse you and to complete His blessings upon you that you may be appreciative"
  5,7,"And recall God's blessings over you and His covenant that He has bound you with, for which you have said: \"We hear and obey,\" and be aware of God; for God knows what is inside the chests"
  5,8,"O you who believe, stand for God and be witnesses for justice, and let not the hatred towards a people make you avoid being just. Be just, for it is closer to righteousness, and be aware of God. God is expert over what you do"
  5,9,God has promised those who believe and do right that they will have forgiveness and a great reward
