  9,94,"They will apologize to you when you return to them, Say: \"Do not apologize, we will not believe you, for God has told us of your news.\" And God will see your work, as will His messenger, then you will be returned to the knower of the unseen and the seen, He will inform you of what you did"
  9,95,"They will swear by God to you, when you return to them, so that you would let them be. So let them be, for they are foul, and their destiny is Hell as a recompense for what they earned"
  9,96,"They swear to you so that you would accept them. Even if you accept them, God does not accept the wicked people"
  9,97,"The Nomads are the worst in rejection and hypocrisy, and more likely not to know the limits of what God has sent down upon His messenger. God is Knower, Wise"
  9,98,"And from the Nomads are some who look upon what they spend as a fine, and wait for misfortune upon you. They will have the misfortune of evil, and God is Hearer, Knowledgeable"
  9,99,"And from the Nomads are those who believe in God and the Last Day, and he looks upon what he spends to make him closer to God, and the contact-methods with the messenger. It indeed makes them closer. God will admit them in His mercy; God is Forgiving, Merciful"
