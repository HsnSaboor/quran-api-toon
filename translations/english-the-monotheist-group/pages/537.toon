quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,This is an honourable Quran
  56,78,In a protected record
  56,79,None can grasp it except those pure
  56,80,A revelation from the Lord of the worlds
  56,81,Are you disregarding this narration
  56,82,"And you have your provisions, yet you are denying"
  56,83,So when the time comes and it reaches your throat
  56,84,And at that moment you look around
  56,85,"We are closer to it than you are, but you do not see"
  56,86,If it is true that you do not owe any account
  56,87,"Then return it, if you are truthful"
  56,88,"So, if he is one of those who are made near"
  56,89,"Then joy, and rose buds, and paradises of bliss"
  56,90,And if he is one of the people of the right
  56,91,"Then: \"Peace\" from the people of the right"
  56,92,"But if he is one of the deniers, the strayers"
  56,93,Then an abode of boiling water
  56,94,And a burning in Hell
  56,95,This is the absolute truth
  56,96,"You shall glorify the name of your Lord, the Great"
  57,1,"Glorifying God is everything in the heavens and the Earth. He is the Noble, the Wise"
  57,2,To Him is the kingship of the heavens and the Earth. He brings life and death. And He is capable of all things
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last, the Evident and the Innermost. And He is fully aware of all things"
