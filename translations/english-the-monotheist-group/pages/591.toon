quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,And the sky and the herald
  86,2,And do you know what the herald is
  86,3,The piercing star
  86,4,Every soul has a recorder over it
  86,5,So let man see from what he was created
  86,6,He was created from water that gushes forth
  86,7,It comes out from between the spine and the testicles
  86,8,For He is able to bring him back
  86,9,The Day when all is revealed
  86,10,Then he will not have any power or victor
  86,11,And the sky which gives rain
  86,12,And the land with small cracks
  86,13,This is the word that separates matters
  86,14,And it is not a thing for amusement
  86,15,They are scheming their schemes
  86,16,And I scheme a scheme
  86,17,"So respite the rejecters, respite them for a while"
  87,1,"Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High"
  87,2,The One who created and developed
  87,3,And the One who measured and then guided
  87,4,And the One who brought out the pasture
  87,5,So He made it dry-up into hay
  87,6,"We will make you study, so do not forget"
  87,7,"Except for what God wills, He knows what is declared and what is hidden"
  87,8,And We will make easy for you the way
  87,9,"So remind, perhaps the reminder will help"
  87,10,He who is reverent will remember
  87,11,And he who is wicked will avoid it
  87,12,He will enter the great Fire
  87,13,Then he will neither die in it nor live
  87,14,Whosoever develops will succeed
  87,15,"And remembers the name of his Lord, and reaches out"
