quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,Moving amongst them will be immortal children
  56,18,"With cups, pitchers and drinks which are pure"
  56,19,"They do not run out, nor do they get bored"
  56,20,And fruits of their choice
  56,21,And meat of birds that they desire
  56,22,And wonderful companions
  56,23,Like pearls which are sheltered
  56,24,A reward for their works
  56,25,"They never hear any nonsense therein, nor sinful utterances"
  56,26,"Only the utterances of: \"Peace. Peace"
  56,27,"And those on the right, who will be with those on the right"
  56,28,In lush orchards
  56,29,And fruit-trees which are ripe
  56,30,And extended shade
  56,31,And flowing water
  56,32,And many fruits
  56,33,Neither ending; nor forbidden
  56,34,And raised furnishings
  56,35,We have planted them deeply
  56,36,And made them never previously touched
  56,37,Perfect and without spoil
  56,38,For those on the right side
  56,39,Many from the early generations
  56,40,And many from the later generations
  56,41,"And those on the left, who will be from those on the left"
  56,42,In fierce hot winds and boiling water
  56,43,And a shade that is unpleasant
  56,44,"Neither cool, nor helpful"
  56,45,They used to be indulged in luxury before this
  56,46,And they persisted in the great blasphemy
  56,47,"And they used to Say: \"After we die and turn to dust and bones, we will get resurrected"
  56,48,As well as our forefathers
  56,49,"Say: \"The people of old and the later generations"
  56,50,Will be summoned to a meeting on a predetermined Day
