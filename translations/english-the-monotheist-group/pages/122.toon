quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"And if they hear what was sent down to the messenger you see their eyes flooding with tears, for what they have known as the truth, they Say: \"Our Lord, we believe, so record us with the witnesses"
  5,84,And why shouldn't we believe in God and what has come to us of the truth And we yearn that our Lord admits us with the righteous people
  5,85,"So God rewarded them for what they have said with paradises that have rivers flowing beneath them, in them they shall abide; such is the reward of the good doers"
  5,86,And those who rejected and denied Our revelations; they are the dwellers of Hell
  5,87,"O you who believe, do not forbid the good things that God has made lawful to you, and do not aggress; God does not like the aggressors"
  5,88,"And eat from what He has provided for you, good and lawful; and be aware of God in whom you believe"
  5,89,"God will not hold you for your unintentional oaths, but He will hold you for what oaths you have made binding; its cancellation shall be the feeding of ten poor from the average of what you feed your family, or that you clothe them, or that you free a slave; whoever cannot find shall fast for three days; this is a cancellation for making your oaths when you swear. And be careful from making oaths. It is such that God clarifies for you His revelations that you may be thankful"
