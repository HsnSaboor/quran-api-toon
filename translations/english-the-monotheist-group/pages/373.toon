quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,137,This is nothing but an invention by the people of old
  26,138,And we are not going to be punished
  26,139,"So they denied him, and We destroyed them. In that is a sign, but most are not believers"
  26,140,"And your Lord is the Noble, the Merciful"
  26,141,Thamud denied the messengers
  26,142,"For their brother Saleh said to them: \"Will you not be righteous"
  26,143,I am to you a clear messenger
  26,144,So be aware of God and obey me
  26,145,"And I do not ask you for a wage, for my reward is upon God the Lord of the worlds"
  26,146,Will you be left secure in that which you have here
  26,147,In gardens and springs
  26,148,And green crops and palm trees laden with fruit
  26,149,And you carve homes out of the mountains with great skill
  26,150,So be aware of God and obey me
  26,151,And do not obey the command of the carefree
  26,152,The ones who corrupt in the land and are not reformers
  26,153,"They said: \"You are but one of those bewitched"
  26,154,You are but a human being like us. So bring a sign if you are of the truthful ones
  26,155,"He said: \"This is a female camel which will have to drink and you will drink on a different day"
  26,156,"And do not afflict her with harm, else the retribution of a great day will seize you"
  26,157,"But they slaughtered her, and they became regretful"
  26,158,"So the retribution took them. In that is a sign, but most of them are not believers"
  26,159,"And your Lord is the Noble, the Merciful"
