quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,Not equal are those who stayed behind from the believers; except those disabled; with those who strived in the cause of God with their money and lives. God has preferred those who strive with their money and lives over those who stayed behind by a grade; and to both God has promised goodness; and God has preferred the strivers over those who stay by a great reward
  4,96,"Grades from Him and forgiveness and a mercy. God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  4,97,"Those whom the Angels take, while they had wronged their souls; they said: \"What situation were you in\", they said: \"We were oppressed on Earth.\" They said: \"Was God's Earth not wide enough that you could emigrate in it\" To these their abode will be Hell; what a miserable destiny"
  4,98,"Except for those who were oppressed from the men, women, and children who could not devise a plan nor could be guided to a way"
  4,99,"For these, perhaps God will pardon them. God is Pardoner, Forgiving"
  4,100,"Whoever emigrates in the cause of God will find in the land many spoils and a bounty. And whoever leaves his home emigrating to God and His messenger, then is overcome by death; his reward has fallen to God, and God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  4,101,"And if you are on the offensive in the land, then there is no harm that you shorten the contact-method, if you fear that the disbelievers will try you. The disbelievers are to you a clear enemy"
