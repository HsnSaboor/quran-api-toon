  14,10,"Their messengers said: \"Is there doubt regarding God, the initiator of the heavens and the Earth He invites you so that He may forgive some of your sins, and grant you until a predetermined time.\" They said: \"You are but humans like us, you wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to serve. So come to us with clear proof"
