quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,58,"And if you call to the contact-method, they take it as fun and games. That is because they are a people who do not understand"
  5,59,"Say: \"O people of the Scripture, do you hate us simply because we believe in God and in what was sent down to us and what was sent down before\" Alas, most of them are vile"
  5,60,"Say: \"Shall I inform you of worse than this as a punishment from God Those whom God cursed and became angry at them, and He made from them apes and pigs and servants of evil. Those have a worst place and are more astray from the right path"
  5,61,"And if they come to you they Say: \"We believe,\" while they had entered in with rejection and went out with the same. God is aware of what they were hiding"
  5,62,And you see many of them hasten to sin and transgression and consuming money illicitly. Miserable indeed is what they were doing
  5,63,Did not the Rabbis and Priests deter them for speaking evil and consuming money illicitly Miserable indeed is what they had done
  5,64,"And the Jews said: \"The hand of God is tied-down!\" Their hands will be tied-down, and they will be cursed for what they have said. No, His hands are wide open spending as He wills. And for many of them, what has been sent down to you will increase them in rebellion and rejection; and We have cast between them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they ignite the fire of war, God puts it out; and they seek to make corruption in the land; and God does not like the corrupters"
