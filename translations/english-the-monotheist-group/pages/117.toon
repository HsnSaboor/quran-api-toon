quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,51,"O you who believe, do not take the Jews and the Nazarenes as allies, for they are allies to one another; and whoever takes them as such from amongst you is one of them. God does not guide the wicked people"
  5,52,"You will see those who have a disease in their hearts hurrying to them, saying: \"We fear that a disaster will befall us!\" Perhaps God will bring a victory or a decree from Himself, then they will become regretful over what they had kept hidden within themselves"
  5,53,"And those who believe said: \"Were these the ones who swore oaths by God that they are with you\" Their works have collapsed, and they have become losers"
  5,54,"O you who believe, whoever from among you turns away from His system, then God will bring a people whom He loves and they love Him; humble towards the believers, proud towards the rejecters; they strive in the cause of God and do not fear to be blamed by those who blame. This is God's grace, He bestows it upon whom He wills; God is Encompassing, Knowledgeable"
  5,55,"For your supporter is God and His messenger and those who believe, who hold the contact-method, and contribute towards betterment, and they are kneeling"
  5,56,And whoever allies God and His messenger and those who believe; then the party of God are the ones who will be victorious
  5,57,"O you who believe, do not take as allies those who have taken your system as fun and games from among those who have been given the Scripture before you and the rejecters. And be aware of God if you are believers"
