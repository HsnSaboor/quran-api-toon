  67,2,"The One who created death and life, that He may test you, which of you will do better works He is the Noble, the Forgiving"

  67,4,Then look again twice; your eyes will come back humiliated and tired
  67,5,"And We have adorned this universe with lamps, and We made it with projectiles against the devils; and We prepared for them the retribution of the blazing Fire"

  67,10,"And they said: \"If we had listened or understood, we would not be among the dwellers of the blazing Fire"
  67,11,"Thus, they confessed their sins. So away with the dwellers of the blazing Fire"
  67,12,"As for those who reverence their Lord unseen, they have attained forgiveness and a great reward"
