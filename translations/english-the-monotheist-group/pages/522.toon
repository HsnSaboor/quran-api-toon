quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"He said: \"What is your undertaking, O messengers"
  51,32,"They said: \"We have been sent to a criminal people"
  51,33,To send down upon them rocks of clay
  51,34,Prepared by your Lord for the transgressors
  51,35,We then vacated from it all the believers
  51,36,But We only found in it one house of those who had surrendered
  51,37,And We have left in it a sign for those who fear the painful retribution
  51,38,"And also Moses, for We sent him to Pharaoh with a clear authority"
  51,39,"But he turned away, in arrogance, and he said: \"A magician, or crazy"
  51,40,"So We took him and his troops; We cast them into the sea, and he was to blame"
  51,41,"And also 'Aad, for We sent upon them the hurricane wind"
  51,42,Anything that it came upon was utterly destroyed
  51,43,"And also Thamud, for it was said to them: \"Enjoy for a while"
  51,44,But they rebelled against the command of their Lord. So the lightning struck them while they were looking
  51,45,"They were unable to rise up, nor could they win"
  51,46,And the people of Noah before; they were a wicked people
  51,47,"And We constructed the universe using matter, and We will expand it"
  51,48,And the Earth We furnished; glory be to the Makers
  51,49,"And from everything We created a pair, perhaps you may remember"
  51,50,So turn towards God. I am to you from Him a clear warner
  51,51,And do not make any other god with God. I am to you from Him a clear warner
