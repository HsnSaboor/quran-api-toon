quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,104,"And if they are told: \"Come to what God has sent down, and to the messenger;\" they Say: \"We are content with what we found our fathers doing.\" What if their fathers did not know anything nor were guided"
  5,105,"O you who believe, you are responsible for yourselves; none who are misguided can harm you if you are guided. To God is your return, all of you, and then He will inform you of what you have done"
  5,106,"O you who believe, witnessing a will if death is approaching to one of you shall be done by two who are just amongst you. Or, if you have ventured out in the land, then two others may suffice if death is approaching you; you will hold them after the contact-method, and let them swear by God if you have doubt: \"We will not purchase with it any price, even if he was a near relative, and we will not conceal the testimony of God, or else we are then of the sinners"
  5,107,"If it is then found out that they had lied, then two others will take their place from those who were present, and they will swear by God: \"Our testimony is more truthful than their testimony, and if we aggress, then we are of the wicked"
  5,108,"This is best so that they would bring the testimony on its face value, for fear that their oaths would be discarded after being made. And be aware of God, and listen; God does not guide the wicked people"
