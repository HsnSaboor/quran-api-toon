quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,84,"And We have taken a covenant with you: \"You shall not spill each other's blood, nor drive each other out from your homes.\" And you agreed to this while bearing witness"
  2,85,"But then here you are killing each other and driving out a group of you from their homes; you act towards them with evil and animosity. And if they come to you as prisoners, you ransom them while it was forbidden for you to drive them out! Do you believe in some of the Scripture and disbelieve in some The punishment for those amongst you who do so is humiliation in this worldly life, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be returned to the most severe retribution. God is not unaware of what you all do"
  2,86,"These are the ones who have purchased this worldly life instead of the Hereafter. The retribution will not be reduced for them, nor will they be supported"
  2,87,"And We gave Moses the Scripture, and after him We sent the messengers. And We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs, and We supported Him with the Holy Spirit. Is it that every time a messenger comes to you with what your souls do not desire, you become arrogant A group of them you deny, and a group of them you kill"
  2,88,"And they said: \"Our hearts are sealed!\" No, it is God who has cursed them for their rejection, for very little do they believe"
