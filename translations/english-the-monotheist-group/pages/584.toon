quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,His Lord called him at the holy valley of Tuwa
  79,17,"Go to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed"
  79,18,"Tell him: \"Would you not be purified"
  79,19,"And I will guide you to your Lord, that you may turn reverent"
  79,20,He then showed him the great miracle
  79,21,But he disbelieved and rebelled
  79,22,Then he turned away in a hurry
  79,23,So he gathered and proclaimed
  79,24,"He said: \"I am your lord, the most high"
  79,25,"So God seized him with retribution in the Hereafter, as well as in the first life"
  79,26,In that is a lesson for those who are aware
  79,27,Are you a more powerful creation than the sky which He built
  79,28,"He raised its height, and perfected it"
  79,29,And He covered its night and brought out its morning
  79,30,And the land after that He spread out
  79,31,He brought forth from it its water and pasture
  79,32,And the mountains He fixed firmly
  79,33,All this to be a provision for you and your livestock
  79,34,"Then, when the great blow comes"
  79,35,The Day when the human remembers all that he strove for
  79,36,And Hell will be apparent to all who can see
  79,37,As for the one who transgressed
  79,38,And he was preoccupied with the worldly life
  79,39,Then Hell will be the abode
  79,40,"And as for the one who reverenced the majesty of his Lord, and restrained himself from desire"
  79,41,The Paradise will be the abode
  79,42,"They ask you about the Hour: \"When is its appointed time"
  79,43,You have no knowledge if it
  79,44,To your Lord is its term
  79,45,You are simply to warn those who fear it
  79,46,"For the Day they see it, it will be as if they had remained one evening or half a day"
