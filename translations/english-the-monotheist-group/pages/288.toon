quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,59,"And what stopped Us from sending the signs except that the previous people disbelieved in them. And We sent to Thamud the camel with foresight, but they did her wrong. And We do not send the signs except to make them fearful"
  17,60,"And when We said to you: \"Your Lord has encompassed mankind.\" And We did not make the vision that We showed you except as a test for mankind, and tree that was cursed in the Quran. And We are making them fearful, but it only increases their transgression"
  17,61,"And We said to the Angels: \"Submit to Adam.\" So they submitted except for Satan, he said: \"Shall I submit to one you have created from mud"
  17,62,"He said: \"Shall I show You this one whom You have preferred over me, that if You respite me until the Day of Resurrection, I will seize his progeny, except for a few"
  17,63,"He said: \"Go, and whoever follows you from them. Hell shall be the reward to you all, a reward well deserved"
  17,64,"And entice whoever you can of them with your voice, and mobilize all your forces and men against them, and you may share with them in their money and children, and promise them.\" But the devil promises nothing but deceit"
  17,65,"As for My servants, you will have no power over them.\" And your Lord suffices as a Caretaker"
  17,66,Your Lord in the One Who drives the ships for you in the sea so that you may seek of His bounty. He is Most Merciful towards you
