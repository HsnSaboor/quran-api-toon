quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,"Consequently, he has no friend here today"
  69,36,"Nor any food, except from pollutants"
  69,37,Food for the sinners
  69,38,I swear by what you see
  69,39,And what you do not see
  69,40,This is the utterance of an honourable messenger
  69,41,It is not the utterance of a poet; rarely do you believe
  69,42,Nor the utterance of a soothsayer; rarely do you take heed
  69,43,A revelation from the Lord of the worlds
  69,44,And had he attributed anything falsely to Us
  69,45,We would have seized him by the right
  69,46,"Then, We would have severed his life-line"
  69,47,None of you would be able to prevent it
  69,48,And this is a reminder for the righteous
  69,49,And We know that some of you are deniers
  69,50,And that it is a distress for the rejecters
  69,51,And it is the absolute truth
  69,52,"Therefore, you shall glorify the name of your Lord, the Great"
  70,1,Someone asked about the inevitable retribution
  70,2,"For the rejecters, there is nothing that will stop it"
  70,3,"From God, Possessor of the ascending portals"
  70,4,The Angels and the Spirit ascent to Him in a day which is equivalent to fifty thousand years
  70,5,So be patient with a good patience
  70,6,They see it as far away
  70,7,And We see it as near
  70,8,On the Day the sky is like molten copper
  70,9,And the mountains are like wool
  70,10,And no friend will ask about his friend
