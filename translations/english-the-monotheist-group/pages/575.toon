quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Your Lord knows that you rise a little less than two thirds of the night, and half of it, and one third of it, as well as a group of those who are with you. And God measures the night and the day. He knows that you will not be able to keep-up, so He pardons you. So study what is made easy of the Quran. He knows that there will be sick among you, and others that venture out in the land seeking from God's bounty, and others who are fighting in the cause of God, so study what you can of it. And hold the contact-method and contribute towards betterment and give God a loan of righteousness. And whatever you put forth yourselves, you will find it with God, for it is better and a greater reward. And seek God's forgiveness, for God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  74,1,O you blanketed one
  74,2,Stand and warn
  74,3,And your Lord glorify
  74,4,And purify your outer garments
  74,5,And leave all that is vile
  74,6,And do not give expecting something in return
  74,7,And to your Lord be patient
  74,8,So when the trumpet is sounded
  74,9,That will be a very difficult Day
  74,10,Upon the rejecters it will not be easy
  74,11,So leave Me alone with the one I have created
  74,12,And I gave him abundant wealth
  74,13,And children to bear witness
  74,14,And I made everything comfortable for him
  74,15,Then he is greedy wanting that I give more
  74,16,No. He was stubborn to Our revelations
  74,17,I will exhaust him in climbing
