  2,113,"And the Jews said: \"The Nazarenes have no basis,\" and the Nazarenes said: \"The Jews have no basis,\" while they are both reciting the Scripture! Similarly, those who do not know have said the same thing. God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection in what they disputed"
  2,114,And who are more wicked than those who boycott God's temples; so that His name not be mentioned in them; and they seek their destruction They will not be able to enter them except in fear; they will have humiliation in this world and in the Hereafter a painful retribution
  2,115,"And to God belongs the east and the west, so wherever you turn, there is God's presence. God is Encompassing, Knowledgeable"
  2,116,"And they said: \"God has taken a son!\" Be He glorified. To Him is all that is in the heavens and in the Earth, all are humbled to Him"
  2,117,"Initiator of heavens and Earth, when He decrees a command, He merely says to it: \"Be\" and it is"
  2,118,"And those who do not know said: \"If only God would speak to us, or a sign would come to us.\" It is the same thing that the people before them have said, their hearts are so similar! We have clarified the signs for a people who comprehend"
  2,119,We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and warner. You will not be questioned about the people of Hell
