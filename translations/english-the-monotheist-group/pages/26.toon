  2,170,"And if they are told: \"Follow what God has sent down,\" they Say: \"No, we will follow what we found our fathers doing!\" What if their fathers did not understand anything and were not guided"
  2,171,"And the example of those who disbelieve is like one who repeats what he has heard of calls and shouts; deaf, dumb, and blind, they do not understand"
  2,172,"O you who believe, eat of the good things We have provided for you, and be thankful to God; if it is Him you serve"
  2,173,"He has only forbidden for you what is already dead, and the blood, and the meat of pig, and what was dedicated to other than God. Whoever finds himself forced out of need and without disobedience or animosity, then there is no sin upon him. God is Forgiving, Merciful"
