quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,And how can you reject when God's revelations are being recited to you and with you is His messenger And whoever holds firmly to God has been guided to the straight path
  3,102,"O you who believe, revere God as He deserves to be revered, and do not die except as ones who have surrendered"
  3,103,"And hold firmly to the rope of God, all of you, and do not be separated. And remember God's blessing upon you when you were enemies and He united your hearts, then you became with His blessing as brothers; and you were on the verge of a pit of fire and He saved you from it; it is thus that God clarifies for you His signs that you may be guided"
  3,104,"And let there be a nation from amongst you which calls towards goodness, and orders kindness, and deters from evil. And these are the successful ones"
  3,105,And do not be like those who separated and differed after the clarity had come to them. And for them is a painful retribution
  3,106,"The Day on which faces will be whitened and faces will be blackened; as for those whose faces will be blackened: \"Did you reject after believing Taste the retribution for what you rejected"
  3,107,"As for those whose faces are whitened, they are in God's mercy, in it they abide eternally"
  3,108,"These are God's revelations, We recite them to you with truth. God does not want wickedness for the worlds"
