quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,80,"Whether you seek forgiveness for them, or do not seek forgiveness for them. If you seek forgiveness for them seventy times, God will not forgive them. That is because they have rejected God and His messenger; and God does not guide the wicked people"
  9,81,"Those who have remained behind are content with their position behind God's messenger, and they disliked to strive with their wealth and lives in the cause of God; and they Say: \"Do not march out in the heat.\" Say: \"The fire of Hell is far hotter,\" if they could only understand"
  9,82,"Let them laugh a little, and cry a lot, a recompense for what they had earned"
  9,83,"If God returns you to a group of them, and they ask your permission to come with you, then Say: \"You will not come with me ever; nor will you fight any enemy with me. You had accepted staying behind the first time, so stay with those who remain behind"
  9,84,"And do not attend towards any of them when they have died, nor stand at their grave. They have rejected God and His messenger and died while they were wicked"
  9,85,"And do not be impressed by their wealth and their children; God only wishes to punish them with it in this world, and so their souls will be taken to death while they are rejecters"
  9,86,"And if a chapter is sent down: \"That you shall believe in God and strive with His messenger,\" those with wealth and influence ask your permission and they Say: \"Let us be with those who remain behind"
