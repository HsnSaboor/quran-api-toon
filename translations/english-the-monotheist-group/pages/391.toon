quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,44,You were not on the western side of the mount when We decreed the command to Moses. You were not a witness
  28,45,"And We established many generations, and many ages passed them by. And you were not living among the people of Midyan, reciting Our revelations to them. But We did send messengers"
  28,46,"Nor were you on the slope of the mount when We called. But it is a mercy from your Lord, so that you may warn a people who received no warner before you, perhaps they may take heed"
  28,47,"Thus, if any disaster strikes them as a consequence of their own deeds they cannot Say: \"Our Lord, if only You sent a messenger to us, so that we would follow Your revelations, and we would be of the believers"
  28,48,"But when the truth came to them from Us, they said: \"If only he was given the same that was given to Moses!\" Had they not rejected what was given to Moses before They had said: \"Two magicians assisting one another.\" And they said: \"We reject all these things"
  28,49,"Say: \"Then bring forth a scripture from God that is better in guidance so I may follow it, if you are truthful"
  28,50,"But if they fail to respond to you, then know that they follow only their desires. And who is more astray than one who follows his desire, without guidance from God God does not guide the wicked people"
