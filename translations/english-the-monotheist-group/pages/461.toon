quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,"As for he who opens his chest to surrender, then he will be on a light from his Lord. So woe to those whose hearts are hardened against remembering God. They have gone far astray"
  39,23,"God has sent down the best narration, a Scripture that is similar with two paths. The skins of those who reverence their Lord shiver from it, then their skins and their hearts soften up to the remembrance of God. Such is God's guidance; He guides with it whoever He wills. And for whomever God misguides, then none can guide him"
  39,24,"As for he who saves his face from the terrible retribution on the Day of Resurrection; and it will be said to the transgressors: \"Taste for what you have earned"
  39,25,"Those before them have denied, and thus the retribution came to them from where they did not perceive"
  39,26,"So God made them taste the humiliation in this worldly life, but the retribution in the Hereafter is far greater, if only they knew"
  39,27,"And We have cited for the people in this Quran from every example, that they may take heed"
  39,28,"A Quran in Arabic, without any crookedness, that they may be righteous"
  39,29,"God cites the example of a man who has partners that dispute with each other, and a man who has given to dealing with only one man. Are they the same Praise be to God; most of them do not know"
  39,30,"You will die, and they will die"
  39,31,"Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will quarrel at your Lord"
