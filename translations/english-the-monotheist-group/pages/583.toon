quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,"As for the righteous, they will have success"
  78,32,Gardens and vineyards
  78,33,And grapes that are ripe
  78,34,And a cup that is full
  78,35,They do not hear in it any vile talk or lies
  78,36,"A reward from your Lord, in recognition for what is done"
  78,37,"The Lord of heavens and Earth and what is between them, the Almighty. They do not posses any authority beside Him"
  78,38,"The Day when the Spirit and the Angels stand in line, none will speak unless the Almighty permits him and he speaks what is true"
  78,39,"That is the Day of truth, so let whoever wills seek a way to his Lord"
  78,40,"I have warned you of a retribution which is close, the Day when man will look at what he has brought forth and the rejecter will Say: \"I wish I were dust"
  79,1,By those that take the person forcibly
  79,2,And those that take the person gently
  79,3,And those that swim along
  79,4,And those that press forward in a race
  79,5,So as to carry out a command
  79,6,On the Day the ground shakes
  79,7,It will be followed by the second blow
  79,8,Hearts on that Day will be terrified
  79,9,Their eyes cast down
  79,10,"They will Say: \"Shall we be returned to live our lives"
  79,11,Even after we were crumbled bones
  79,12,"They said: \"This is an impossible recurrence"
  79,13,But all it takes is one blow
  79,14,Whereupon they will rise-up
  79,15,Did the story of Moses come to you
