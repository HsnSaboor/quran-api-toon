quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  59,10,"And those who came after them saying: \"Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us to the faith, and do not place in our hearts any animosity towards those who believed. Our Lord, You are Compassionate, Merciful"
  59,11,"Have you noted those who are hypocrites, they say to their companions in disbelief among the people of the Scripture: \"If you are driven out we will go out with you, and we will never obey anyone who opposes you. And if anyone fights you, we will support you.\" God bears witness that they are liars"
  59,12,"If they were driven out, they would not have gone out with them, and if anyone fought them, they would not have supported them. And even if they supported them, they would have turned around and fled. They could never win"
  59,13,"Indeed, you strike more terror in their hearts than their fear of God. This is because they are people who do not comprehend"
  59,14,"They will not fight you all unless they are in fortified towns, or from behind walls. Their might appears formidable among themselves. You would think that they are united, but their hearts are divided. This is because they are people who do not understand"
  59,15,Like the example of those who preceded them. They suffered the consequences of their decisions. They have incurred a painful retribution
  59,16,"Like the example of the devil, when he says to the human being: \"Disbelieve,\" then as soon as he disbelieves, he says: \"I disown you. I fear God, the Lord of the worlds"
