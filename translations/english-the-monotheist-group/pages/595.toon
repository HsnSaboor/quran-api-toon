quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the Sun and its brightness
  91,2,And the Moon that comes after it
  91,3,And the day which reveals
  91,4,And the night which covers
  91,5,And the sky and what He built
  91,6,And the Earth and what He sustains
  91,7,And a soul and what He made
  91,8,So He gave it its evil and good
  91,9,Successful is the one who betters it
  91,10,And failing is the one who buries it
  91,11,Thamud denied their transgression
  91,12,They followed the worst amongst them
  91,13,"God's messenger said to them: \"This is God's camel, let her drink"
  91,14,"They disbelieved him, and they killed her. So their Lord repaid them for their sin and levelled it"
  91,15,"Yet, those who came after remain heedless"
  92,1,By the night when it covers
  92,2,And the day when it appears
  92,3,And He created the male and female
  92,4,Your works are various
  92,5,As for he who gives and is righteous
  92,6,And trusts in goodness
  92,7,We will make the easy path for him
  92,8,And as for he who is stingy and holds back
  92,9,And denies goodness
  92,10,We will make the difficult path for him
  92,11,And his wealth will not avail him when he demises
  92,12,It is upon Us to guide
  92,13,And to Us is the end and the beginning
  92,14,I have warned you of a Fire that blazes
