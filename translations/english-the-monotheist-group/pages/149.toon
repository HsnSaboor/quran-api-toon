quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,152,"And do not come near the money of the orphan, except for what is best, until he reached his maturity; and give honestly full measure and weight equitably. We do not burden a soul except by what it can bear, and if you speak then be just even if against a relative; and regarding the pledges made to God, you shall observe them. This He has enjoined you that you may remember"
  6,153,"And this is My path, a Straight One. \"So follow it, and do not follow the other paths lest they divert you from His path. That is what He has enjoined you to that you may be righteous"
  6,154,"Then We gave Moses the Scripture, to complete for those who do right, and to fully detail all things, and a guide and mercy that they may believe in the meeting of their Lord"
  6,155,"And this is a Scripture that We have sent down which is blessed, so follow it and be aware, that you may receive mercy"
  6,156,"Lest you Say: \"The Scripture was only sent down to two groups before us, and we were unaware of their study"
  6,157,"Or you Say: \"If the Scripture was sent to us we would have been more guided than they!\" Clarity has come to you from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy. Who is more wicked than one who denies God's revelations and turns away from them We will punish those who turn away from Our revelations with the pain of retribution for what they turned away"
