quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,"It is not for a believing man or believing woman, if God and His messenger issue any command, that they have any choice in their decision. And anyone who disobeys God and His messenger, he has gone far astray"
  33,37,"And you said to the one who was blessed by God, and blessed by you: \"Keep your wife and reverence God,\" and you hid inside yourself what God wished to proclaim. And you feared the people, while it was God you were supposed to fear. So when Zayd ended his relationship with his wife, We had you marry her, to establish that there is no wrongdoing for the believers in marrying the wives of their adopted sons if their relationship is ended. And God's command is always done"
  33,38,There is no blame on the prophet in doing anything that God has decreed upon him. Such was God's way with the people of old. And God's command is a determined duty
  33,39,"Those who deliver God's messages, and reverence Him, and they do not reverence anyone but God. God suffices as a Reckoner"
  33,40,"Mohammed was not the father of any man among you, but he is the messenger of God and the seal of the prophets. And God is fully aware of all things"
  33,41,"O you who believe, you shall remember God frequently"
  33,42,And glorify Him morning and evening
  33,43,"He is the One who reaches out to you, along with His Angels, to lead you out of darkness into the light. And He is ever Merciful towards the believers"
