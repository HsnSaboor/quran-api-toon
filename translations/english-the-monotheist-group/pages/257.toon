quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  14,11,"Their messengers said: \"We are but humans like you, but God will bestow His grace upon whom He pleases from His servants. And it is not up to us to bring you proof except by God's leave. And in God the believers should place their trust"
  14,12,"And why should we not place our trust in God, when He has guided us our path. And we will be patient to the harm you inflict upon us. And in God those who trust should put their trust"
  14,13,"And those who rejected said to their messengers: \"We will drive you out of our land, or you will return to our creed.\" It was then that their Lord inspired to them: \"We will destroy the wicked"
  14,14,And We will let you reside in the land after them. That is for those who fear My station and fear My deliverance
  14,15,"And they sought victory, and every arrogant tyrant was then made to lose"
  14,16,"From behind him is Hell, and he will be served boiling water"
  14,17,"He tries to drink it, but it cannot be swallowed, and death comes to him from everywhere, but he will not die; and from behind him is a powerful retribution"
  14,18,"The example of those who reject their Lord is that their works are like ashes, on which the wind blows strongly on a stormy day, they cannot get anything of what they earned. Such is the farthest misguidance"
