quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,6,And there is not a creature on Earth except that its provision is due from God. And He knows where it dwells and where it hides. All is in a clear record
  11,7,"He is the One who created the heavens and Earth in six days, and His throne was upon the water, and to test who from amongst you works the best. And when you Say: \"You will be resurrected after death.\" those who rejected will Say: \"This is but clear magic"
  11,8,"And if We delay for them the retribution to a near period, they will Say: \"What has kept it\" Alas, on the day it comes to them, nothing will turn it away from them, and what they used to mock will catch-up with them"
  11,9,"And if We give man a taste of mercy from Us, then We withdraw it from him; he becomes despairing, rejecting"
  11,10,"And if We give him the taste of a blessing after hardship had afflicted him, he will Say: \"Evil has gone from me!\"; he becomes happy, boastful"
  11,11,"Except for those who are patient and do good work; these will have a pardon, and a great reward"
  11,12,"So perhaps you wish to ignore some of what has been inspired to you, and you are depressed by it, because they Say: \"If only a treasure was sent down with him, or an Angel had come with him!\" You are but a warner, and God is caretaker over all things"
