quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,This should be cherished by Quraysh
  106,2,The way they cherish the journey of the winter and summer
  106,3,So let them serve the Lord of this sanctuary
  106,4,"The One who fed them from hunger, and protected them from fear"
  107,1,Do you know who rejects the system
  107,2,It is the one who mistreats the orphans
  107,3,And does not encourage the feeding of the poor
  107,4,So woe to those who reach out
  107,5,But who are totally heedless of their contact-method
  107,6,They only want to be seen
  107,7,And they deter from helping others
  108,1,We have given you plenty
  108,2,"Therefore, you shall reach out to your Lord, and sacrifice"
  108,3,Indeed your rival will be the loser
