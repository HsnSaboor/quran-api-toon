quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"Those who linger and observe you, if you have a victory from God they Say: \"Were we not with you\" And if the rejecters have success, they Say: \"Did we not side with you and deter the believers from you\" God will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection, and God will not grant the rejecters any success over the believers"
  4,142,"The hypocrites seek to deceive God, while He is deceiving them; and if they attend to the contact-method, they do so lazily, only to show the people; they do not remember God except very little"
  4,143,"They are swaying in-between, neither belonging to this group nor to that group. Whoever God will misguide, you will not find for him a way"
  4,144,"O you who believe, do not take the rejecters as allies instead of the believers. Do you want God to have a reason against you"
  4,145,The hypocrites will be in the lowest level of the Fire; and you will not find for them a victor
  4,146,"Except those who repent, and amend, and hold fast to God, and purify their system to God; then these will be with the believers. And God will grant the believers a great reward"
  4,147,"What would God want with your punishment if you were only thankful and believed God is Appreciative, Knowledgeable"
