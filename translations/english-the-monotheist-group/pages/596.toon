  92,20,"Except the face of His Lord, the Most High"
  92,21,And he will be satisfied
  93,1,By the late morning
  93,2,And the night when it falls
  93,3,"Your Lord has not left you, nor did He forget"
  93,4,And the Hereafter is better for you than the first

  94,6,With hardship comes ease
  94,7,"So when you are done, then stand"
  94,8,And to your Lord you shall seek
