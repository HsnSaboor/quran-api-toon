quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  39,6,"He created you from one person, then He made from it its mate. And He sent down to you eight pairs of the livestock. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, a creation after a creation in three darkness's. Such is God your Lord. To Him belongs the sovereignty. There is no god besides Him. How is it then you deviate"
  39,7,"If you reject, then know that God is in no need of you, and He dislikes rejection for His servants. And if you are appreciative, He is pleased for you. And none shall bear the burdens of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you of everything you had done. He is fully aware of what is inside the chests"
  39,8,"And when the human being is afflicted with adversity, he implores his Lord, turning in repentance to Him. But then, when He grants him a blessing from Him, he forgets his previous imploring, and sets up equals with God, in order to mislead others from His path. Say: \"Enjoy your rejection for a while; for you are of the dwellers of the Fire"
  39,9,"As for one who is meditating in the night, prostrating and standing, fearing the Hereafter, and seeking the mercy of his Lord. Say: \"Are those who know equal to those who do not know\" Only those who possess understanding will remember"
  39,10,"Say: \"O My servants who believed, be aware of your Lord.\" For those who worked righteousness in this world will be a good reward, and God's Earth is spacious. Those who steadfastly persevere will receive their recompense fully, without reckoning"
