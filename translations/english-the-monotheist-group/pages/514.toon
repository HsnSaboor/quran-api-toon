quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  48,24,"And He is the One who withheld their hands against you, and your hands against them in the interior of Mecca, after He had made you victorious over them. God is Seer of what you do"
  48,25,"They are the ones who rejected and barred you from the Restricted Temple, and barred your donations from reaching their destination. And there had been believing men and women whom you did not know, and you may have hurt them, and on whose account you would have committed a sin unknowingly. God will admit into His mercy whomever He wills. Had they become separated, We would then have punished those of them who rejected with a painful retribution"
  48,26,"Those who rejected had put in their hearts the rage of the days of ignorance, then God sent down tranquility upon His messenger and the believers, and directed them to uphold the word of righteousness, and they were well entitled to it and worthy of it. And God is fully aware of all things"
  48,27,"God has fulfilled with truth His messenger's vision: \"You will enter the Restricted Temple, God willing, secure, with your heads shaven and shortened, having no fear.\" Thus, He knew what you did not know, and He has coupled with this a near victory"
  48,28,"He is the One who sent His messenger with the guidance and the system of truth, so that it would expose all other systems. And God is sufficient as a witness"
