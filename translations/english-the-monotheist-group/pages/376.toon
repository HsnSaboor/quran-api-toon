quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,All they luxury they were given will not avail them
  26,208,And We have not destroyed any town except after having warners
  26,209,"By way of a reminder, and We were never unjust"
  26,210,And it is not the devils who have brought this down
  26,211,"Nor would they, nor could they"
  26,212,They are blocked from the knowledge
  26,213,"So do not call upon any other god with God, else you will be with those punished"
  26,214,And warn your closest kin
  26,215,And lower your wing for any who follow you of the believers
  26,216,"Then if they disobey you, then Say: \"I am innocent from what you do"
  26,217,"And put your trust in the Noble, the Merciful"
  26,218,The One who sees you when you stand
  26,219,And your movements amongst those who prostrate
  26,220,"He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable"
  26,221,Shall I inform you on whom the devils descend
  26,222,They descend on every sinful liar
  26,223,"They claim to listen, but most of them are liars"
  26,224,"And the poets, are followed by the strayers"
  26,225,Do you not see that they traverse in every valley
  26,226,"And that what they say, is not what they do"
  26,227,"Except for those who believe, and do good works, and remember God greatly, and were victorious after they were wronged. As for those who did wrong, they will know which fate they will meet"
