quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,10,"And those who reject and deny Our revelations, they are the dwellers of Hell"
  5,11,"O you who believe, recall God's blessings upon you when a group desired to aggress against you, and God restrained their hands from you. And reverence God. And in God the believers should put their trust"
  5,12,"God has taken the covenant of the Children of Israel and sent from them twelve representatives, and God said: \"I am with you if you hold the contact-method, and contribute towards betterment, and believe in My messengers, and support them, and give God a loan of righteousness; then I will cancel your sins and admit you into gardens with rivers flowing beneath.\" Whoever rejects after this from you, then he has strayed from the path"
  5,13,"But because of them breaking their covenant, We have cursed them, and made their hearts become hardened; they take the words out of context; and they forgot much of what they were reminded of. And you will still discover betrayal in them except for a few; so pardon them and overlook; God loves the good doers"
