  46,29,"And We sent to you a small number of Jinn, in order to let them listen to the Quran. So when they arrived there, they said: \"Pay attention.\" Then, when it was finished, they returned to their people, to warn them"
  46,30,"They said: \"O our people, we have heard a Scripture that was sent down after Moses, authenticating what is present with him. It guides to the truth; and to a Straight Path"
  46,31,"O our people, respond to God's caller, and believe in Him. He will then forgive your sins, and spare you a painful retribution"
  46,32,"And whosoever does not respond to God's caller, then he cannot escape on the Earth, and he will not have besides Him any allies. These are the ones who have gone far astray"
  46,33,"Did they not see that God, Who created the heavens and the Earth, and was not tired by their creation, is able to revive the dead Yes indeed; He is able to do all things"

On the Day they will see what they have been promised, it will be as if they had not remained except for one hour of a single day. A proclamation: \"Are any destroyed except for the wicked people"
