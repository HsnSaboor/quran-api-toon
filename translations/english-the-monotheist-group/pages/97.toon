quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"There is no good in most of what they desire, except whoever orders a charity or kindness or reconciliation between the people. And whoever does this seeking God's favour, We will give him a great reward"
  4,115,"And whoever is hostile to the messenger after the guidance has been made clear to him, and he follows other than the path of the believers; We will grant him what he has sought and deliver him to Hell; what a miserable destination"
  4,116,"God does not forgive to have partners set up with Him, but He forgives other than that for whom He pleases. Whoever sets-up partners with God has indeed strayed a far straying"
  4,117,"They are only calling on females beside God. Indeed, they are only calling on a persistent devil"
  4,118,"God has cursed him; and he had said: \"I will take from Your servants a sizeable portion"
  4,119,"And I will misguide them and make them desire, and I will command them, so that they will mark the ears of the livestock, and I will command them so they will make change to God's creation.\" Whoever takes the devil as a supporter other than God, then he has indeed lost a great loss"
  4,120,"He promises them and makes them desire, but what the devil promises them is only vanity"
  4,121,"For these, their abode shall be Hell, they will find no escape from it"
