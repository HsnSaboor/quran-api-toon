quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,40,"And on the Day when He gathers them all, He will say to the Angels: \"Was it you that these people used to worship"
  34,41,"They will Say: \"Be You glorified. You are our Lord, not them. No, most of them were worshiping the Jinn; most were believers to them"
  34,42,"So today, none of you can help or harm one another. And We will say to the transgressors: \"Taste the retribution of the Fire that you used to deny"
  34,43,"And when Our clear revelations were recited to them, they said: \"This is but a man who wants to turn you away from what your parents were worshiping.\" And they also said: \"This is nothing but a fabricated lie.\" And those who disbelieved say of the truth when it has come to them: \"This is nothing but evident magic"
  34,44,"We had not given to them any Scriptures to study, nor did We send to them before you any warner"
  34,45,"And those before them had also denied, while they did not reach one tenth of what We have given to this generation, so they denied My messengers, how severe was My retribution"
  34,46,"Say: \"I advise you to do one thing: that you stand to God, in pairs or as individuals, then reflect. There is no madness in your friend, he is only a warner to you in the face of a severe retribution"
  34,47,"Say: \"I have not asked you for any wage; you can keep it. My wage is from God, and He is witness over all things"
  34,48,"Say: \"My Lord rebuts with the truth. He is the Knower of all secrets"
