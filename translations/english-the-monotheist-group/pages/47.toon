quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"Those who consume financial interest, they do not rise except as the one who is being beaten by the devil out of direct touch. That is because they have said: \"Trade is like financial interest.\" While God has made trade lawful, and He has forbidden financial interest. Whoever has received understanding from His Lord and ceases, then he will be forgiven for what was before this and his case will be with God. But whoever returns, then they are the people of the Fire, in it they will abide eternally"
  2,276,God wipes out the financial interest and He grants growth to the charities. And God does not like any wicked sinner
  2,277,"Those who believe and do good works, and hold the contact-method, and contribute towards betterment; they will have their rewards with their Lord and there is no fear over them nor will they grieve"
  2,278,"O you who believe, be aware of God and give up what is left of the financial interest if you are truly believers"
  2,279,"And if you will not do this, then take notice of a war from God and His messenger; but if you repent, then you will have back your principal money, you will not be wronged nor will you wrong"
  2,280,"If the person is facing insolvency, then you shall wait until he becomes able. And if you relinquish it as a charity it is better for you if you knew"
  2,281,"And be aware of a Day when you will be returned to God then every soul will be paid what it has earned, they will not be wronged"
