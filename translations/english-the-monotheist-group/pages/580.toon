quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  76,26,And from the night you shall prostrate to Him and praise Him throughout
  76,27,"These people like the current life, and they put behind them a heavy Day"
  76,28,"We have created them, and We have made them strong. And if We wished, We would replace their kind completely"
  76,29,"This is a reminder, so let whoever wills take a path to his Lord"
  76,30,"And you cannot will, except if God wills. God is Knowledgeable, Wise"
  76,31,"He admits whom He wills to His mercy. And as for the wicked, He has prepared for them a painful retribution"
  77,1,By the winds which are sent
  77,2,Then the gusts that blow
  77,3,And all that is scattered about
  77,4,So the separators which divide
  77,5,Then the remembrance that is found
  77,6,An excuse or a warning
  77,7,What you are being promised will come to pass
  77,8,So when the stars are plunged
  77,9,And when the sky is opened
  77,10,And when the mountains are destroyed
  77,11,And when the messengers are gathered
  77,12,For what day has it been delayed
  77,13,For the Day of Separation
  77,14,And do you know what is the Day of Separation
  77,15,Woe on that Day to the disbelievers
  77,16,Did We not destroy the ancient people
  77,17,Then We made others succeed them
  77,18,It is such that We do to the criminals
  77,19,Woe on that Day to the disbelievers
