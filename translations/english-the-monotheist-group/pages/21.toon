quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,135,"And they said: \"Be Jews or Nazarenes so that you may be guided!\" Say: \"No, rather the creed of Abraham, monotheism; for he was not of those who set up partners"
  2,136,"Say: \"We believe in God and in what was sent down to us and what was sent down to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs, and what was given to Moses and Jesus, and what was given to the prophets from their Lord; we do not make a distinction between any of them and to Him we surrender"
  2,137,"So, if they believe exactly as you have believed, then they are guided; but if they turn away, then they are in opposition and God will suffice you against them, and He is the Hearer, the Knower"
  2,138,"Such is God's coloring, and who better than God in coloring. And to Him we are in service"
  2,139,"Say: \"Do you debate with us regarding God He is our Lord and your Lord, and we have our work and you have your work, and to Him we are believers"
  2,140,"Or do you say that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Patriarchs were all Jewish or Nazarene\" Say: \"Are you more knowledgeable or is God\" Who is more wicked than one who conceals a testimony with him from God God is not unaware of what you do"
  2,141,"That was a nation that passed away, to them is what they earned and to you is what you have earned; you will not be asked about what they did"
