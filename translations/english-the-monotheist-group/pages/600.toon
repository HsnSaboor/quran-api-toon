quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,And what is in the chests is gathered
  100,11,That their Lord has been fully cognizant of them
  101,1,The Shocker
  101,2,What is the Shocker
  101,3,And how would you know what the Shocker is
  101,4,The Day when people come out like swarms of butterflies
  101,5,And the mountains will be like fluffed up wool
  101,6,As for him whose weights are heavy
  101,7,He will be in a happy life
  101,8,As for him whose weights are light
  101,9,His destiny is the lowest
  101,10,And how would you know what it is
  101,11,A blazing Fire
  102,1,Hoarding has distracted you
  102,2,Until you visit the graves
  102,3,"No, you will find out"
  102,4,"Then again, you will find out"
  102,5,"No, if only you had the knowledge of certainty"
  102,6,You would then see Hell
  102,7,Then you will see it with the eye of certainty
  102,8,"Then you will be questioned, on that Day, about the blessings"
