quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,Those who disbelieve in the Hereafter have given the Angels feminine names
  53,28,While they had no knowledge about this; they only followed conjecture. And conjecture is no substitute for the truth
  53,29,"So disregard he who turns away from Our reminder, and only desires this worldly life"
  53,30,"This is the extent of their knowledge. Your Lord is fully aware of those who strayed away from His path, and He is fully aware of those who are guided"
  53,31,"And to God belongs everything in the heavens and everything on Earth. He will requite those who commit evil for their works, and will reward the righteous for their righteousness"
  53,32,"They avoid major sins and lewdness, except for minor offences. Your Lord is with vast forgiveness. He has been fully aware of you since He initiated you from the Earth, and while you were embryos in your mothers' wombs. Therefore, do not acclaim yourselves; He is fully aware of the righteous"
  53,33,Have you noted the one who turned away
  53,34,"And he gave very little, then he stopped"
  53,35,Did he possess knowledge of the future Could he see it
  53,36,Or was he not informed of the teachings in the Scriptures of Moses
  53,37,And of Abraham who fulfilled
  53,38,None can carry the burdens of another
  53,39,And the human being will have what he sought
  53,40,And his works will be shown
  53,41,Then he will be paid fully for such works
  53,42,And to your Lord is the final destiny
  53,43,And He is the One who makes laughter and tears
  53,44,And He is the One who takes life and gives it
