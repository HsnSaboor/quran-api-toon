quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  49,12,"O you who believe, you shall avoid much suspicion, for some suspicion is sinful. And do not spy on one another, nor shall you backbite one another. Would one of you enjoy eating the flesh of his dead brother You certainly would hate this. You shall observe God. God is Redeemer, Merciful"
  49,13,"O mankind, We created you from a male and female, and We made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Surely, the most honourable among you in the sight of God is the most righteous. God is Knowledgeable, Expert"
  49,14,"The Nomads said: \"We believe.\" Say: \"You have not believed; but you should Say: 'We have surrendered', for belief has not yet entered into your hearts.\" If you obey God and His messenger, He will not put any of your works to waste. God is Forgiver, Merciful"
  49,15,"Believers are those who believe in God and His messenger, then they became without doubt, and they strive with their money and their lives in the cause of God. These are the truthful ones"
  49,16,"Say: \"Are you teaching God about your system while God knows everything in the heavens and the Earth God is knowledgeable of all things"
  49,17,"They think they are doing you a favour by having surrendered! Say: \"Do not think you are doing me any favours by your surrender. For it is God who is doing you a favour that He has guided you to the faith, if you are being true"
  49,18,"Surely, God knows all the unseen in the heavens and the Earth; God is Seer of everything you do"
