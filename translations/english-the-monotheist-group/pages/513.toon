quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  48,16,"Say to those Nomads who lagged behind: \"You will be called on to fight a people who are very powerful in warfare, unless they surrender. Then if you obey, God will grant you a good reward, but if you turn away as you turned away before, He will punish you with a painful retribution"
  48,17,"There is no burden on the blind, nor is there any burden on the cripple, nor is there on the sick any burden. And whosoever obeys God and His messenger, He will admit them into paradises with rivers flowing beneath; and whosoever turns away, He will punish him with a painful retribution"
  48,18,"God is pleased with the believers who pledged allegiance to you under the tree. He thus knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquility upon them, and rewarded them with a near victory"
  48,19,"And abundant spoils that they will take. God is Noble, Wise"
  48,20,"God has promised you abundant spoils that you will take. Thus He has hastened this for you, and He has withheld the people's hands against you; that it may be a sign for the believers, and that He may guide you to a straight path"
  48,21,"And the other group which you could not vanquish, God took care of them. And God was capable of all things"
  48,22,"And if the rejecters had fought you, they would have turned and ran, then they would have found neither an ally nor a victor"
  48,23,"Such is God's way with those who have passed away before, and you will not find any change in God's way"
