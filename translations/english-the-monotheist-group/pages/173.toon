quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,171,"And We raised the mountain above them as if it were a cloud, and they thought it would fall on them: \"Take what We have given you with strength and remember what is in it that you may be righteous"
  7,172,"And your Lord took for the children of Adam from their backs, their progeny; and He made them witness over themselves: \"Am I not your Lord\" They said: \"Yes, we bear witness.\" Thus you cannot say on the Day of Resurrection that you were unaware of this"
  7,173,"Nor can you Say: \"It was our fathers who set up partners before and we were simply a progeny who came after them. Would You destroy us for what the innovators did"
  7,174,"It is such that We explain the revelations, perhaps they will revert"
  7,175,"And recite to them the story of the person whom Our revelations were given to him, but he removed himself from them, and thus the devil followed him, and He became of those who went astray"
  7,176,"Had We wished, We could have elevated him by it, but he stuck to the Earth and he followed his desire. His example is like the dog, if you scold him he pants, and if you leave him he pants; such is the example of the people who deny Our revelations. Relate the stories, perhaps they will think"
  7,177,"Miserable is the example of the people who denied Our revelations, and it was their souls that they had wronged"
  7,178,"Whoever God guides, then he is the guided one; and whoever He misguides, then these are the losers"
