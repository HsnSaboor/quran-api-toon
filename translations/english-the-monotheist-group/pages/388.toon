  28,22,"And as he traveled towards Midyan, he said: \"Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the right path"
  28,23,"When he arrived at the watering hole of Midyan, he found a crowd of people watering, and he noticed two women waiting on the side. He said: \"What is holding you back.\" They said: \"We cannot draw water until the shepherds finish, and our father is an old man"
  28,24,"So he drew water for them, then he turned to a shaded area, and he said: \"My Lord, I am poor, lacking any provisions You may have sent down"
  28,25,"So one of the two women approached him, shyly, and said: \"My father invites you to reward you for watering for us.\" So when he came to him, and told him his story, he said: \"Do not fear, for you have been saved from the wicked people"
  28,26,"One of the two women said: \"O my father, hire him. For the best to be hired is one who is strong and honest"
  28,27,"He said: \"I wish you to marry one of my two daughters, on condition that you work for me through eight pilgrimage periods; if you complete them to ten, it will be voluntary on your part. I do not wish to make this matter too difficult for you. You will find me, God willing, of the righteous"
  28,28,"He said: \"It is then an agreement between me and you. Whichever period I fulfill, you will not be averse to either one. And God is entrusted over what we said"
