quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  33,44,"Their greeting the Day they meet Him is: \"Peace\" and He has prepared for them a generous recompense"
  33,45,"O prophet, We have sent you as a witness, and a bearer of good news, and a warner"
  33,46,"Inviting to God, by His leave, and a guiding beacon"
  33,47,"And give good news to the believers, that they have deserved from God a great blessing"
  33,48,"And do not obey the rejecters and the hypocrites, and ignore their insults, and put your trust in God; God suffices as an advocate"
  33,49,"O you who believe, if you marry the believing women, then divorced them before having intercourse with them, then there is no interim required of them. You shall compensate them, and let them go in an amicable manner"
  33,50,"O prophet, We have made lawful for you the wives to whom you have already given their dowry, and the one who is committed to you by oath, as granted to you by God, and the daughters of your father's brothers, and the daughters of your father's sisters, and the daughters of your mother's brothers, and the daughters of your mother's sisters, of whom they have emigrated with you. Also, the believing woman who had decreed herself to the prophet, the prophet may marry her if he wishes, as a privilege given only to you and not to the believers. We have already decreed their rights in regard to their spouses and those who are still dependant. This is to spare you any hardship. God is Forgiver, Merciful"
