quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the fig and the olive
  95,2,And the mount of ages
  95,3,And this secure land
  95,4,We have created mankind in the best form
  95,5,Then We returned him to the lowest of the low
  95,6,"Except those who have believed and done good work, they will have a reward of thanks"
  95,7,So what would make you deny the system after that
  95,8,Is God not the wisest of the wise
  96,1,Read in the name of your Lord who has created
  96,2,He created man from a clot
  96,3,"Read, and your Lord is the Generous One"
  96,4,The One who taught by the pen
  96,5,He taught man what he did not know
  96,6,"Alas, man is bound to transgress"
  96,7,"When he achieves, he has no need"
  96,8,To your Lord is the return
  96,9,Have you seen the one who deters
  96,10,A servant from reaching out
  96,11,Have you seen if he was being guided
  96,12,Or he ordered righteousness
  96,13,Have you seen if he lied and turned away
  96,14,Did he not know that God can see
  96,15,"Alas, if he does not cease, We will strike the frontal lobe"
  96,16,A frontal lobe which lies and errs
  96,17,So let him call on his supporter
  96,18,We will call on the guardians
  96,19,"Alas, do not obey him, prostrate and come near"
