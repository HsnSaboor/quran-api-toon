quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,The people of Lot denied the messengers
  26,161,"For their brother Lot said to them: \"Will you not be righteous"
  26,162,I am to you a trustworthy messenger
  26,163,So be aware of God and obey me
  26,164,And I do not ask you for a wage for my reward is upon God the Lord of the worlds
  26,165,Do you approach the males of the worlds
  26,166,And you leave what your Lord has created for you of mates You are an intrusive people
  26,167,"They said: \"If you do not cease O Lot, you will be among those driven out"
  26,168,"He said: \"I am in severe opposition to your acts"
  26,169,"My Lord, save me and my family from what they do"
  26,170,So We saved him and his entire family
  26,171,Except for an old woman who remained
  26,172,Then We destroyed the others
  26,173,And We rained upon them a rain. Miserable was the rain to those who had been warned
  26,174,"In that is a sign, but most of them are not believers"
  26,175,"And that your Lord is the Noble, the Merciful"
  26,176,The dwellers of the Woods disbelieved the messengers
  26,177,"For Shu'ayb said to them: \"Will you not be righteous"
  26,178,I am to you a trustworthy messenger
  26,179,So be aware of God and obey me
  26,180,"And I do not ask you for a wage, for my reward is upon God the Lord of the worlds"
  26,181,Give full measure and do not be of those who cause losses
  26,182,And weigh with the balance that is straight
  26,183,"And do not defraud the people of their belongings, and do not venture into the land corrupting"
