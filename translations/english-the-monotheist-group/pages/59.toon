quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,71,"O people of the Scripture, why do you dress the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know"
  3,72,"And a group from among the people of the Scripture said: \"Believe in what was revealed to those who believed during the beginning of the day, and reject it by the end of it, perhaps they will return"
  3,73,"And do not believe except to those who follow your system.\" Say: \"The guidance is God's guidance.\" \"That anyone should be given similar to what you have been given, or that they debate with you at your Lord.\" Say: \"The bounty is in God's hand, He gives it to whom He chooses, and God is Encompassing, Knowledgeable"
  3,74,"He specifies with His mercy whom He chooses, and God is with Great Bounty"
  3,75,"And from among the people of the Scripture are those whom if you entrust him with a large amount he gives it back to you, and there are those whom if you entrust with one gold coin he will not return it to you unless you are standing over him. That is because they said: \"We have no obligation towards the Gentiles.\" They say about God lies while knowing"
  3,76,"Indeed, anyone who fulfils his pledge and is aware of God, then God loves the righteous"
  3,77,"The ones that purchase with God's pledge and their oaths a small price, those will have no portion in the Hereafter, and God will not speak to them nor look at them on the Day of Resurrection nor purify them, and they will have a painful retribution"
