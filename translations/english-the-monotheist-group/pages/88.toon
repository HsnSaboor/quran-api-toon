quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,60,"Did you not see those who claimed they believed in what was sent down to you and what was sent before you They wanted to seek judgment using evil, while they were ordered to reject it. It is the devil who wants to lead them far astray"
  4,61,"And if they are told: \"Come to what God has sent down and to the messenger,\" you see the hypocrites turning away from you strongly"
  4,62,"Why then, when a tragedy befalls them for what their hands have brought forth do they come to you swearing by God that they only wanted to do good and reconcile"
  4,63,"These are a people whom God knows what is in their hearts, so turn away from them and advise them, and speak to their souls with a clear saying"
  4,64,"We do not send a messenger except to be obeyed by God's leave. And had they come to you when they had wronged themselves and sought God's forgiveness, and the messenger sought forgiveness for them, they would have then found God to be Pardoning, Merciful"
  4,65,"No, by your Lord, they will not believe until they make you judge in what they dispute with each other, then they will not find in their souls any animosity for what you have decided, and they will yield completely"
