quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  55,68,"In them are fruits, date palms, and pomegranate"
  55,69,So which of your Lord's favours will you deny
  55,70,In them is what is good and beautiful
  55,71,So which of your Lord's favours will you deny
  55,72,"Companions, inside grand pavilions"
  55,73,So which of your Lord's favours will you deny
  55,74,"No human has ever touched them, nor Jinn"
  55,75,So which of your Lord's favours will you deny
  55,76,"Reclining on green carpets, in beautiful surroundings"
  55,77,So which of your Lord's favours will you deny
  55,78,"Glorified be the name of your Lord, Possessor of Majesty and Honour"
  56,1,When the inevitable comes to pass
  56,2,Nothing can stop it from happening
  56,3,"It will bring low, and raise up"
  56,4,When the Earth will be shaken a terrible shake
  56,5,And the mountains will be wiped out
  56,6,So that they become only scattered dust
  56,7,And you will be in three groupings
  56,8,"So those on the right, who will be from those on the right"
  56,9,"And those on the left, who will be from those on the left"
  56,10,"And those foremost, who will be from those foremost"
  56,11,They will be the ones who are brought near
  56,12,In the paradises of bliss
  56,13,Many from the first generations
  56,14,And a few from the later generations
  56,15,Upon luxurious furnishings
  56,16,"Residing in them, neighbouring each other"
