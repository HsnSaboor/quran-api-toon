  44,40,"Surely, the Day of Separation is the appointment for them all"
  44,41,That is the Day when no friend can help his friend in any way; nor will they be helped
  44,42,"Except him on whom God has mercy. He is the Noble, the Merciful"
  44,43,"Surely, the tree of Bitterness"
  44,44,Will be the food for the sinful
  44,45,"Like hot oil, it will boil in the stomachs"
  44,46,Like the boiling of liquid
  44,47,Take him and throw him into the midst of Hell
  44,48,Then pour upon his head the retribution of boiling liquid
  44,49,"Taste this; surely you are the noble, the generous"
  44,50,"Surely, this is what you used to doubt"
  44,51,The righteous will be in a place of security
  44,52,Among paradises and springs
  44,53,Wearing silk and satin; facing each other
  44,54,"So it is, and We coupled them with wonderful companions"
  44,55,"They enjoy in it all kinds of fruits, in perfect peace"
  44,56,"They do not taste death therein except for the first death, and He has spared them the retribution of Hell"
  44,57,As a blessing from your Lord. Such is the great triumph
  44,58,"We have thus made it easy in your language, perhaps they may take heed"
  44,59,"Therefore, keep watch; for they too will keep watch"
