quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"And those who believe Say: \"If only a chapter is sent down!\" But when a firm chapter is sent down, and fighting is mentioned in it, you see those who have a disease in their hearts look at you, as if death had already come to them. It thus revealed them"
  47,21,"Obedience and to speak righteousness until the matter is decided, then if they trust God it would be better for them"
  47,22,"So do you plan that when you turn away, that you will corrupt the land and sever your family ties"
  47,23,These are the ones whom God has cursed and thus He made them deaf and blinded their sight
  47,24,Do they not reflect on the Quran Or are there locks on their hearts
  47,25,"Surely, those who reverted back, after the guidance has been made clear to them, the devil has enticed them and led them on"
  47,26,"That is because they said to those who hated what God had sent down: \"We will obey you in certain matters.\" And God knows their secrets"
  47,27,"So how will it be when the Angels put them to death, striking their faces and their backs"
  47,28,"That is because they followed that which angered God, and they hated that which pleased Him. Thus, He nullified their works"
  47,29,Or did those who harbour a disease in their hearts think that God would not bring out their evil thoughts
