  6,132,But there are degrees for what they had done; and your Lord is not unaware of what they do
  6,133,"And your Lord is Rich with Mercy. If He wished, He could remove you and bring after you whom He pleases, just like He established you from the seed of another people"
  6,134,"What you have been promised will come, you cannot escape it"
  6,135,"Say: \"My people, work as you see fit, and I will work. You will then know to whom will be the punishment of the Hereafter. The wicked will not succeed"
  6,136,"And they made for God a portion of what He provided them of crops and the livestock; they said: \"This is for God,\" by their claims, \"And this is for our partners.\" So what was for their partners did not reach God, and what was for God, it reached their partners! Miserable is how they judged"
  6,137,"And it was adorned for those who set up partners, by such partners, to kill their unborn children in order to turn them and to confuse their system for them. Had God willed they would not have done this, so ignore them and what they invent"
