quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,1,"O people, be aware of your Lord who has created you from one soul and He created from it its mate and sent forth from it many men and women; and be aware of God whom you ask about, and the relatives. God is watcher over you"
  4,2,"And give the orphans their money, and do not replace the good with the bad, and do not consume their money to your money; for truly it is a great sin"
  4,3,"And if you fear that you cannot be just to the orphans, then marry those whom you see fit from their mothers, two, and three, and four. But if you fear you will not be fair, then only one, or whom you are already betrothed to. This is best that you do not face financial hardship"
  4,4,"And give the women their property willingly, and if they remit any of it to you of their own will, then you may take it with good feelings"
  4,5,"And do not give the immature ones their money that God has entrusted to you, and spend on them from it and clothe them, and speak to them in goodness"
  4,6,"And test the orphans until they reach the age of marriage, then if you determine in them sound judgment, then give them their wealth, and do not deliberately consume it wastefully or quickly before they grow up. And whoever is rich, then let him not claim anything, and if he is poor then let him consume only in goodness. If you give to them their wealth, then make a witness for them, and God is enough for Reckoning"
