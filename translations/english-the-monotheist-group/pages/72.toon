quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,166,"And what you suffered on the day the two hosts met was by God's leave, and to let the believers know"
  3,167,"And to let those who are hypocrites know, that they were told: \"Come fight in the cause of God or defend,\" they said: \"If we knew how to fight we would have followed you.\" They are closer to disbelief then they are to belief. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts, and God is aware of what they conceal"
  3,168,"Those who remained and said to their brothers: \"If they obeyed us they would not have been killed.\" Say: \"Then avert death away from yourselves if you are truthful"
  3,169,"And do not think that those who are killed in the sake of God are dead. No, they are alive at their Lord receiving a bounty"
  3,170,"Happy with what God has granted them from His favour, and they rejoice for those who have yet to follow after them. There is no fear over them nor do they grieve"
  3,171,They rejoice with God's bounty and favour; God will not waste the reward of the believers
  3,172,Those who have answered God and the messenger after they were afflicted with wounds. For those of them who did good and were righteous is a great reward
  3,173,"The ones who the people said to them: \"The people have gathered against you, so be fearful of them,\" but it only increased their faith and they said: \"God is enough for us, and He is the best to put our trust in"
