quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,75,"And why do you not fight in the cause of God, when the weak amongst the men and women and children Say: \"Our Lord, bring us out of this town whose people are wicked, and grant us from Yourself a Supporter, and grant us from Yourself a Victor"
  4,76,"Those who believe fight in the cause of God, while those who reject fight in the cause of evil; so fight the supporters of the devil, for the planning of the devil is weak"
  4,77,"Did you not see those who were told: \"Restrain yourselves, and hold the contact-method, and contribute towards betterment.\" But when fighting was decreed for them, a group of them feared the people as much as they feared God or even more so. And they said: \"Our Lord, why did You decree fighting for us If only You would delay for us till another time.\" Say: \"The enjoyment of this world is little, and the Hereafter is far better for those who are aware; you will not be wronged in the least"
  4,78,"Wherever you may be, death will find you, even if you are in fortified towers. If any good befalls them, they Say: \"This is from God,\" and if any bad befalls them, they Say: \"This is from you!\" Say: \"All is from God;\" what is wrong with these people, they barely understand anything said"
  4,79,"Any good that befalls you is from God, and any bad that befalls you is from yourself. We have sent you as a messenger to the people and God is enough as a witness"
