quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  8,70,"O prophet, say to those prisoners whom you hold: \"If God finds in your hearts any good, He will grant you better than what He took from you, and He will forgive you. God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  8,71,"And if they want to betray you, they have already betrayed God before, and He overpowered them. God is Knowledgeable, Wise"
  8,72,"Those who have believed and emigrated and strived with their money and lives in the cause of God, and those who sheltered and supported; these are the allies of one another. And those who believed but did not emigrate, you do not owe them any allegiance until they emigrate. But if they seek your help in the system, then you must support them, except if it is against a people with whom there is a treaty between you. God is watcher over what you do"
  8,73,"As for those who reject, they are allies to one another. If you do not do this, then there will be oppression on Earth and great corruption"
  8,74,"And those who have believed and emigrated and strived in the cause of God, and those who sheltered and supported, these are truly the believers. They will have a forgiveness and a generous provision"
  8,75,"And those who believed afterwards and emigrated and strived with you, then they are from you. And the relatives by birth are also supportive of one another in God's record. God is aware of all things"
