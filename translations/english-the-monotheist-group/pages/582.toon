quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,What are they inquiring about
  78,2,About the grand news
  78,3,The one which they are in disagreement about
  78,4,"No, they will come to know"
  78,5,"No, then again, they will come to know"
  78,6,Did We not make the Earth a resting ground
  78,7,And the mountains as pegs
  78,8,And We created you in pairs
  78,9,And We made your sleep for resting
  78,10,And We made the night as a covering
  78,11,And We made the day to work in
  78,12,And We constructed above you seven mighty ones
  78,13,And We made a flaming light
  78,14,And We sent down abundant water from the rain clouds
  78,15,To bring out with it seeds and plants
  78,16,And gardens of thick growth
  78,17,The Day of Separation is an appointed time
  78,18,The Day when the horn is blown and you come in crowds
  78,19,"And the universe is opened, so it becomes gates"
  78,20,And the mountains will be moved as if they were a mirage
  78,21,For Hell is in wait
  78,22,For the transgressors it is a dwelling place
  78,23,They will abide in it for eons
  78,24,They will not taste anything cold in it nor drink
  78,25,Except for boiling water and filthy discharge
  78,26,An exact recompense
  78,27,They did not expect the reckoning
  78,28,And they denied Our revelations greatly
  78,29,And everything We have counted in a record
  78,30,"So taste it, for no increase will come to you from Us except in retribution"
