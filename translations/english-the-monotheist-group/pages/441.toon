quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  36,13,"And cite for them the example of the people of the town, when the messengers came to it"
  36,14,"Where We sent two to them, but they disbelieved in them, so We supported them with a third one, thus they said: \"We are messengers to you"
  36,15,"They replied: \"You are but human beings like us, and the Almighty did not send down anything, you are only telling lies"
  36,16,"They said: \"Our Lord knows that we have been sent to you"
  36,17,And we are only required to give a clear delivery
  36,18,"They replied: \"We have welcomed you better than you deserve. If you do not cease, we will stone you, and you will receive a painful retribution from us"
  36,19,"They said: \"Keep your welcome with you, for you have been reminded. Indeed, you are transgressing people"
  36,20,"And a man came running from the farthest part of the city, saying: \"O my people, follow the messengers"
  36,21,"Follow those who do not ask you for any wage, and are guided"
  36,22,"And why should I not serve the One who initiated me, and to Him is your ultimate return"
  36,23,"Shall I take gods besides Him If the Almighty intends any harm for me, their intercession cannot help me in the least, nor can they save me"
  36,24,Then I would be clearly astray
  36,25,"I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me"
  36,26,"It was said: \"Enter Paradise.\" He said \"Oh, how I wish my people only knew"
  36,27,"Of what my Lord has forgiven me, and made me of the honoured ones"
