quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,"What is wrong with you, how do you judge"
  37,155,Will you not remember
  37,156,Or do you have a clear proof
  37,157,"Bring forth your scripture, if you are truthful"
  37,158,And they invented a kinship between Him and the Jinn. But the Jinn know that they will be gathered
  37,159,God be glorified from what they describe
  37,160,Except for God's servants who are faithful
  37,161,As for you and what you worship
  37,162,You cannot lead away from Him
  37,163,Except those who are destined to Hell
  37,164,Every one of us has a destined place
  37,165,And we are the ones who are in columns
  37,166,And we are the ones that glorify
  37,167,And they used to Say
  37,168,If only we had received a reminder from the previous generations
  37,169,We would have surely been God's loyal servants
  37,170,But they rejected it. They will come to know
  37,171,Our word had been decreed to Our servants who were sent
  37,172,That they would be made victorious
  37,173,And that Our soldiers are the winners
  37,174,So turn away from them for awhile
  37,175,And observe them; for they will see
  37,176,Do they seek to hasten Our retribution
  37,177,"Then, when it descends into their courtyard, evil will be the morning, for they have already been warned"
  37,178,And turn away from them for awhile
  37,179,And observe; for they will see
  37,180,"Glory be to your Lord, the Lord of greatness, for what they have described"
  37,181,And peace be upon the messengers
  37,182,"And praise be to God, Lord of the worlds"
