  34,32,"Those who were mighty will say to those who were weak: \"Did we turn you away from the guidance after it had come to you No, it was you who were criminal"
  34,33,"And those who were weak will say to those who were mighty: \"No, it was your scheming night and day, when you commanded us to reject God, and to set up equals to Him.\" And they will be filled with regret, when they see the retribution. And We will place shackles around the necks of those who rejected. Are they not being requited for what they used to do"
  34,34,"And We do not send a warner to any town, except its carefree ones would Say: \"We reject what you have been sent with"
  34,35,"And they said: \"We have more wealth and more children, and we will not be punished"
  34,36,"Say: \"My Lord gives provisions to whomever He wishes, or He restricts them, but most people do not know"
  34,37,"And it is not your money or your children that will bring you closer to Us, but only those who believe and do good work, they will receive double the reward for their works, and they will reside in the high dwellings in peace"
  34,38,"As for those who strive against Our revelations, they will be brought to the retribution"
  34,39,"Say: \"My Lord gives provisions for whom He wishes of His servants and He restricts. And anything you spend, He will replace it; and He is the Best of providers"
