  75,20,"Alas, you all like this world"
  75,21,And neglect the Hereafter
  75,22,Faces on that Day will be shining
  75,23,Looking at their Lord
  75,24,And faces on that Day will be gloomy

  75,26,"Alas, when it reaches the throat"

  75,30,To your Lord on that Day he will be driven
  75,31,For he did not believe nor reach out
  75,32,But he denied and turned away
  75,33,Then he went to his family admiring himself
  75,34,Woe to you and woe to you
