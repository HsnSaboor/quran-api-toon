  2,187,"It has been made lawful for you during the night of fasting to approach your women sexually. They are a garment for you and you are a garment for them. God knows that you used to betray your souls so He has accepted your repentance, and forgiven you; now you may approach them and seek what God has written for you. And you may eat and drink until the white thread is distinct from the black thread of dawn; then you shall complete the fast until night; and do not approach them while you are devoted in the temples.

And be aware of God that you may succeed"
  2,190,"And fight in the cause of God against those who fight you, but do not transgress, God does not like the aggressors"
