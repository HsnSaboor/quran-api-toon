quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,So no intercession of intercessors can help them
  74,49,Why have they turned away from being reminded
  74,50,They are like fleeing zebras
  74,51,Running from the lion
  74,52,"Alas, every one of them wants to be given separate scriptures"
  74,53,"No, they do not fear the Hereafter"
  74,54,"No, it is a reminder"
  74,55,So whosoever wishes will remember it
  74,56,And none will remember except if God wills. He is the source of righteousness and the source of forgiveness
  75,1,I swear by the Day of Judgment
  75,2,And I swear by the soul which is self blaming
  75,3,Does man think that We will not gather his bones
  75,4,"Indeed, We were able to make his fingertips"
  75,5,"No, man desires that he continue committing sins"
  75,6,"He asks: \"When is the Day of Resurrection"
  75,7,"So, when the sight is dazzled"
  75,8,And the moon is eclipsed
  75,9,And the sun and moon are joined together
  75,10,"Man will say on that Day: \"Where can I escape"
  75,11,No. There is no refuge
  75,12,To your Lord on that Day is the abode
  75,13,"Man will be told on that Day what he has put forward, and what he has done"
  75,14,"No, man will testify against himself"
  75,15,Even though he puts forth his excuses
  75,16,Do not move your tongue with it to make haste
  75,17,It is for Us to gather it and relate it
  75,18,"So when We relate it, you shall follow its revelation"
  75,19,Then it is for Us to clarify it
