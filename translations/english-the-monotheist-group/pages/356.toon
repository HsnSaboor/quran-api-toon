quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,44,God rotates the night and the day. In that is a lesson for those who have insight
  24,45,"And God created every moving creature from water. So some of them move on their bellies, and some walk on two legs, and some walk on four. God creates whatever He wills. God is capable of all things"
  24,46,"We have sent down to you clarifying revelations, and God guides whoever He wills to a straight path"
  24,47,"And they Say: \"We believe in God and in the messenger, and we obey,\" but a group of them turn away after that. These are not believers"
  24,48,"And if they are invited to God and His messenger to judge between them, a party of them turn away"
  24,49,"However, if the judgment is in their favour, they come to it willingly with submission"
  24,50,"Is there a disease in their hearts, or are they doubtful Or do they fear that God and His messenger would wrong them in the judgment In fact, they are the wrong doers"
  24,51,"The utterance of the believers when they are invited to God and His messenger to judge in their affairs is to Say: \"We hear and obey.\" These are the winners"
  24,52,"And whosoever obeys God and His messenger, and he fears God and is aware of Him, then these are the winners"
  24,53,"And they swear by God with their strongest oaths that if you would only command them they would mobilize. Say: \"Do not swear, for obedience is an obligation. God is Expert over what you do"
