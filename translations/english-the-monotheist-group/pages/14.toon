quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,89,"And when a Scripture came to them from God, authenticating what is with them; while before that they were mocking those who rejected; so when what they knew came to them, they rejected it! God's curse be upon the rejecters"
  2,90,"Miserable indeed is what they purchase with their souls, that they disbelieve in what God has sent down as a resentment that God would send down from His grace to whom He pleases of His servants; thus they have incurred wrath upon wrath. And the rejecters will have a humiliating retribution"
  2,91,"And if it is said to them: \"Believe in what God has sent down;\" they Say: \"We believe only in what was sent down to us,\" and they reject what came after it, while it is the truth authenticating what is with them. Say: \"Why then did you kill God's prophets if you were believers"
  2,92,"And Moses had come to you with clear proofs, then you took the calf after him; you were wicked"
  2,93,"And We took your covenant, and raised the mount above you: \"Take what We have given you with strength, and listen.\" They said: \"We hear and disobey!\", and they had consumed the calf inside their hearts by their disbelief. Say: \"Miserable indeed is what your belief orders of you if you are believers"
