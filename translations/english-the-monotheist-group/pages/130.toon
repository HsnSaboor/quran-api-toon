quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Say: \"Which is the greatest testimony\" Say: \"God is witness between me and you, and He has inspired to me this Quran that I may warn you with it and whomever it reaches, that you bear witness that along with God are other gods!\"; Say: \"I do not bear witness!\", Say: \"He is only One god, and I am innocent of what you set up"
  6,20,"Those to whom We have given the Scripture know it as they know their children. Those who lost their souls, they do not believe"
  6,21,"And who is more wicked than one who invents lies about God, or denies His revelations! The wicked will never succeed"
  6,22,"And the Day We gather them all, then We say to those who set up partners: \"Where are your partners whom you used to claim"
  6,23,"Then, their only excuse was to Say: \"By God, our Lord, we did not set up partners"
  6,24,See how they lied to themselves; and that which they invented deserted them
  6,25,"And from them are those who listen to you; and We have made covers over their hearts to prevent them from understanding it, and a deafness in their ears; and if they see every sign they will not believe; even when they come to you they argue, those who reject Say: \"This is nothing but the tales from the past"
  6,26,"And they are deterring others from it, and keeping away themselves; but they will only destroy themselves, yet they do not notice"
  6,27,"And if you could see when they are standing over the Fire, they Say: \"If only we could be sent back, we would not deny the revelations of our Lord, and we would be believers"
