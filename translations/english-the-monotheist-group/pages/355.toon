quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  24,37,"Men who are not distracted by trade or sale from the remembrance of God, and holding the contact-method, and contributing towards betterment. They fear a Day when the hearts and sight will be overturned"
  24,38,"God will reward them for the best of what they did, and He will increase them from His grace. And God provides for whom He pleases without any price"
  24,39,"As for those who reject, their works are like a mirage in the desert. A thirsty person thinks it is water, until he reaches it, he finds it is nothing; and he finds God there and He pays him his due, and God is swift in judgment"
  24,40,"Or like the darkness out in a deep ocean in the midst of violent waves, with waves upon waves and dark clouds. Darkness upon darkness, if he brings out his own hand, he could barely see it. And for whomever God does not make a light, he will have no light"
  24,41,"Do you not see that everything in the heavens and the Earth glorifies God Even the birds in formation, each knows its contact-method and its glorification. And God is fully aware of everything they do"
  24,42,"And to God is the sovereignty of the heavens and the Earth, and to God is the final destiny"
  24,43,"Do you not see that God drives the clouds, then He gathers them together, then He piles them upon each other, then you see the soft rain coming out of them And He sends down hail from the sky from the mountains to afflict whomever He wills, and He diverts it from whomever He wills, the brightness of the snow almost blinds the eyes"
