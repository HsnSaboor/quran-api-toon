quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,107,"And there are those who establish a temple to do harm and cause rejection, and to divide between the believers, and as an outpost for those who fought God and His messenger before. They will swear that they only wanted to do good, and God bears witness that they are liars"
  9,108,Do not uphold in it ever. A temple that is founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy that you uphold in it; in it are men who love to be cleansed. And God loves the cleansed
  9,109,"Is one who lays his foundation on obtaining righteousness from God and His acceptance better, or one who lays his foundation on the edge of a cliff which is about to crumble, so that it crumbled with him into the fires of Hell God does not guide the wicked people"
  9,110,"Such a structure that they erect will continue to cause doubt in their hearts, until their hearts are severed. God is Knowledgeable, Wise"
  9,111,"God has purchased from the believers their very lives and their wealth, that they will have Paradise. They fight in the cause of God so they kill and are killed. A promise that is true upon Him in the Torah and the Injeel and the Quran. And whoever fulfills his pledge to God, then have good news of the deal which you concluded with. Such is the supreme success"
