quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,1,"They ask you regarding the spoils of war, Say: \"The spoils of war are for God and the messenger.\" So be aware of God, and be upright in matters between you; and obey God and His messenger if you are believers"
  8,2,"The believers are those whom, when God is mentioned, their hearts reverence; and when His revelations are recited to them, it increases their faith; and they put their trust in their Lord"
  8,3,"They hold the contact-method, and from Our provisions to them they spend"
  8,4,These are the true believers; they will have grades with their Lord and a forgiveness and a generous provision
  8,5,"As your Lord made you go out from your home with the truth, but a party from among the believers disliked this"
  8,6,They argue with you about the truth when it has been made clear to them; as if they were being herded towards death while they are watching
  8,7,"And God promises you that one of the two parties will be defeated by you; and you wish that the one least armed be the one. But God wishes that the truth be manifest with His words, and that He eliminates the remnant of the rejecters"
  8,8,"So that truth will be manifest, and the falsehood will be confounded; even if the criminals dislike it"
