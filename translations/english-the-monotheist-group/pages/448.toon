quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"Who use to Say: \"Are you among those who believe in this"
  37,53,"That if we die and turn into dust and bones, that we would be called to account"
  37,54,"He said: \"Can anyone find him"
  37,55,"So when he looked, he saw him in the midst of Hell"
  37,56,"He said: \"By God, you nearly ruined me"
  37,57,"And had it not been for my Lord's blessing, I would have been with you"
  37,58,Are we then not going to die
  37,59,"Except for our first death, and we will not be punished"
  37,60,Such is the greatest triumph
  37,61,For this let those who will strive work
  37,62,"Is that a better destination, or the tree of Bitterness"
  37,63,We have made it a punishment for the transgressors
  37,64,It is a tree that grows in the midst of Hell
  37,65,Its shoots are like the devils' heads
  37,66,"They will eat from it, so that their bellies are filled up"
  37,67,Then they will have with it a drink of boiling liquid
  37,68,Then they will be returned to Hell
  37,69,They had found their parents astray
  37,70,So they too have hastened in their footsteps
  37,71,Most of the previous generations have strayed before them
  37,72,And We had sent to them warners
  37,73,Thus note the consequences for those who were warned
  37,74,Except for God's servants who are faithful
  37,75,"And Noah had called upon Us, for We are the best to respond"
  37,76,And We saved him and his family from the great disaster
