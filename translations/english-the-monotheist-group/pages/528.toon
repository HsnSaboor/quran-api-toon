quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,"And He is the One who created the pair, male and female"
  53,46,From a seed that is put forth
  53,47,And He will effect the recreation
  53,48,And He is the One who makes you rich or poor
  53,49,And He is the Lord of Sirius
  53,50,And He is the One who destroyed `Aad the first
  53,51,And of Thamud He left nothing
  53,52,And the people of Noah before that; they were evil transgressors
  53,53,And the evil communities were the lowliest
  53,54,"Consequently, they utterly vanished"
  53,55,So which of your Lord's marvels can you deny
  53,56,This is a warning like the older ones
  53,57,The final judgement draws near
  53,58,None beside God can relieve it
  53,59,Are you surprised by this narration
  53,60,"And you are laughing, instead of crying"
  53,61,And you are insisting on your ways
  53,62,"You shall prostrate to God, and serve"
  54,1,"The Hour draws near, and the moon is breached"
  54,2,"And if they see a sign, they turn away and Say: \"Continuous magic"
  54,3,"And they disbelieved, and followed their desires, and every old tradition"
  54,4,While the news had come to them in which there was sufficient warning
  54,5,A perfect wisdom; but the warnings are of no benefit
  54,6,So turn away from them; the Day will come when the caller will announce a terrible disaster
