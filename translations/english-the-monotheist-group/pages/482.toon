quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"To Him belongs the knowledge regarding the Hour. And no fruits emerge from their sheaths, nor does any female conceive or give birth, except by His knowledge. And on the Day He asks them: \"Where are My partners\" They will Say: \"By your leave, none of us will testify to that"
  41,48,"And they were abandoned by that which they used to call on before, and they realised that there will be no escape"
  41,49,"The human being does not tire in imploring for good things. But if adversity touches him, he is disheartened, desperate"
  41,50,"And when We let him taste a mercy from Us after adversity had touched him, he will Say: \"This was by my actions, and I do not think that the Hour will come to pass. And even if I am returned to my Lord, I will find at Him good things for me.\" Surely, We will inform the rejecters of all they had done, and We will let them taste the severe retribution"
  41,51,"And when We bless the human being, he withdraws and turns away, and when he suffers any adversity, he implores in long prayers"
  41,52,"Say: \"Do you see if this was from God and then you rejected it Who is further astray than those who are in opposition"
  41,53,"We will show them Our signs in the horizons, and within themselves, until it becomes clear to them that this is the truth. Is it not enough that your Lord is witness over all things"
  41,54,"Indeed, they are in doubt about meeting their Lord; but He is encompassing all things"
