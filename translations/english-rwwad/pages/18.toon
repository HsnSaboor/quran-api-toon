quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,113,"The Jews say, “The Christians have nothing to stand on” and the Christians say, “The Jews have nothing to stand on<sup>46</sup>,” although they both recite the Scripture. And those [pagans] who have no knowledge say something similar. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.","[46] This incident is documented when the Christians of Najrān came to the Messenger of Allah, the rabbis met them and both parties disputed."
  2,114,"Who does greater wrong than the one who prevents Allah’s name to be mentioned in His mosques and strives for their destruction? Such people do not deserve to enter them except in fear<sup>47</sup>. There is a disgrace for them in this world and a great punishment in the Hereafter.","[47] Fear of divine justice or the believers will seize them."
  2,115,"To Allah belong the east and the west; wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allah<sup>48</sup>. For Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.","[48] i.e., the direction of prayer (Qiblah). This is by way of consolation to the believers that one can find Allah wherever one turns in case of mistake, or prayer of those who prayed to the direction of Jerusalem, etc."
  2,116,"They say, “Allah has taken a son<sup>49</sup>”. Glory be to Him! Rather, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and earth – all are devoutly obedient to Him.","[49] The Jews claimed that Ezra was the son of God, the Christians claimed that Jesus was the son of God, and the Arab pagans claimed that the angels were God’s daughters."
  2,117,"The Originator of the heavens and earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, “Be,” and it is.",""
  2,118,"Those who have no knowledge<sup>50</sup> say, “If only Allah would speak to us or a sign be given to us.” Those who came before them said similar words. Their hearts are all alike. We have made the signs clear to people who have sure faith.","[50] These are from Arab pagans and from the people of the Book, elsewhere called ‘the illiterates’."
  2,119,"We have sent you with the truth [O Prophet] as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and you will not be questioned about the people of the Blazing Fire.",""
