quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  57,4,"It is He Who created the heavens and earth in six days, and then rose over the Throne. He knows all that goes into the earth and all that comes out of it, and all that descends from the heaven and all that ascends to it. He is with you<sup>6</sup> wherever you are, and Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.","[6] By His Knowledge - observing and witnessing all."
  57,5,"To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth, and to Allah will return all matters.",""
  57,6,"He causes the night to merge into the day and the day to merge into the night, and He is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts.",""
  57,7,"Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and spend [in Allah’s cause] out of what He has entrusted you with. For those among you who believe and spend<sup>7</sup>, there will be a great reward.","[7] In the way of Allah."
  57,8,"Why is it that you do not believe in Allah when the Messenger is calling you to believe in your Lord, and He has already taken a covenant from you<sup>8</sup>, if you will ever believe?","[8] See 7:172."
  57,9,"It is He Who sends down clear verses to His slave to bring you out of the depths of darkness into the light. Indeed, Allah is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to you.",""
  57,10,"Why is it that you do not spend in the cause of Allah, when Allah alone will inherit the heavens and earth? Those of you who spent and fought before the conquest [of Makkah and those who did not] are not equal. They are much greater in rank than those who spent and fought afterward<sup>9</sup>. Yet Allah has promised each a fine reward, and Allah is All-Aware of what you do.","[9] Muslims were perceived as weak before the conquest of Makkah. Therefore, those believers who donated and fought in times of weakness and hardship deserve more rewards than those who did so when Muslims were victors and had an upper hand against the enemies."
  57,11,"Who is there to lend Allah a goodly loan, so He will multiply it for him, and for him there will be a generous reward<sup>10</sup>?","[10] i.e., Paradise."
