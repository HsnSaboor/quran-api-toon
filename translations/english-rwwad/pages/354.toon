quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  24,32,"Arrange marriages for those of you who are unmarried<sup>23</sup>, and for the righteous of your bondmen and bondwomen. If they are poor, Allah will suffice them from His bounty, for Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.","[23] Males or females."
  24,33,"Let those who cannot afford marriage keep themselves chaste until Allah suffices them from His bounty. If any of your slaves wishes to enter the contract of emancipation<sup>24</sup>, make this contract with them, if you find goodness in them, and give them some of the wealth that Allah has given you. Do not compel your slave girls into prostitution – if they wish to keep chaste – seeking the worldly gains of this life<sup>25</sup>. But if anyone compels them, then Allah, after such a compulsion, is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","[24] i.e., those slaves who want to purchase their freedom for a specific price.\n [25] As happened with Abdullah ibn ’Ubayy, the head of the hypocrites, who forced his two slave-girls to commit illegal sexual acts for worldly gains, while they wished to keep chaste."
  24,34,"We have sent down to you verses clarifying the right path, and examples of those who passed on before you, and an admonition for those who fear Allah.",""
  24,35,"Allah is the Light<sup>26</sup> of the heavens and earth. The likeness of His light<sup>27</sup> is that of a niche in which is a lamp; the lamp is in a glass; the glass is like a shining star – it is lit by [the oil of] a blessed olive tree, which is neither of the east nor of the west<sup>28</sup>. Its oil would almost glow, even without being touched by fire. Light upon light; Allah guides to His light whom He wills. Allah sets forth comparisons for people, and Allah is All-Knowing of everything.","[26] i.e., the source and Bestower of light.\n [27] The light of guidance in the heart of the believer. [28] As it is located in a central place, so it is hit by sunrays all day long; thus, its oil is of premium quality."
  24,36,"[Such niches are lit] in the houses [of worship] which Allah has ordered to raise up, and where His Name is mentioned, and He is glorified therein morning and evening",""
