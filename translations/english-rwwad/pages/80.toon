quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,15,"Those of your women who commit adultery, call four witnesses against them<sup>12</sup> from amongst you. If they testify, confine them to their homes until they die or Allah ordains for them [another] way<sup>13</sup>.","[12] The witnesses must swear to actually having seen the act taking place.\n [13] The provision of this verse has been abrogated by the verse of Surat an-Nūr (24:2), ordaining lashing for the unmarried and stoning to death for the married."
  4,16,"If two among you commit this [sin], chastise them. Then if they repent and mend their ways, leave them alone<sup>14</sup>. Indeed, Allah is Accepting of Repentance, Most Merciful.","[14] Scholars differed over whether ""the two"" refers to two of the same sex (i.e., homosexuals) or those of opposite sexes. In either case, later rulings outlined in the Sunnah have replaced this one."
  4,17,"Allah only accepts the repentance of those who commit evil out of ignorance, then repent soon thereafter<sup>15</sup>; it is they to whom Allah will turn in forgiveness, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.","[15] Before seeing death with his own eyes."
  4,18,"However, repentance is not for those who commit evil deeds until death approaches one of them, he then says, “Now I repent,” nor for those who die as disbelievers; for them We have prepared a painful punishment.",""
  4,19,"O you who believe, it is not lawful for you to forcibly inherit women, nor to hinder them from marriage, in order to take back some of what you have given them<sup>16</sup> unless they commit a clear adultery. Treat them kindly. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike something which Allah has put much good in it.","[16] At the time of marriage as mahr."
