quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,18,"The Jews and Christians say, “We are Allah’s children and His beloved ones.” Say, “Why then does He punish you for your sins? Rather, you are humans just like anyone else He created. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills.” To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth and all that is between them, and to Him is the final return.”",""
  5,19,"O People of the Book, there has come to you Our Messenger<sup>20</sup>, making things clear to you, after an interval between the messengers, so you do not say, “No bearer of glad tidings or a warner has ever come to us.” Now there has come to you a bearer of glad tidings and a warner. And Allah is Most Capable of all things.","[20] The only Prophet sent after Jesus (عليه السلام) was Muhammad (ﷺ)."
  5,20,"And [remember] when Moses said to his people, “O my people, remember the favor of Allah upon you when He appointed prophets from among you, made you sovereigns<sup>21</sup>, and gave you<sup>22</sup> what He had not given any other people in the world.","[21] Mulūk (lit. kings) could mean: 1. masters served on by others; 2. some were made sovereigns who ruled over people; 3. granted their freedom after being slaves.\n [22] Of all that you need - specifically, homes, wives and servants, etc."
  5,21,"O my people, enter the Holy Land<sup>23</sup> which Allah has ordained for you and do not turn back or else you will return as losers.”","[23] Jerusalem."
  5,22,"They said, “O Moses, there is an extremely mighty people in this land; we will never enter it until they leave it. Then if they leave, only then we will enter.”",""
  5,23,"Two men who feared Allah, and who had been favored by Allah said, “Enter upon them through the gate! Once you enter it, you will surely be victorious. And put your trust in Allah, if you are believers.”",""
