  22,5,"O people, if you are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then We surely created you<sup>1</sup> from dust, then from a drop of sperm<sup>2</sup>, then from a clot<sup>3</sup>, then from a lump of flesh<sup>4</sup> – formed or unformed<sup>5</sup> – so that We may make it clear to you [Our power]. We settle in the wombs whatever We will for an appointed term. Then We bring you out as infants, then [We nurture you] so that you may reach your maturity. Then some of you die, while others are left to reach decrepit old age so that they may know nothing after having knowledge. You see the land lifeless, then as soon as We send down rain on it, it stirs and swells to life and brings forth every type of pleasant plant.","[1] i.e., Your father, Adam.
