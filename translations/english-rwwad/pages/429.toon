quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  34,8,"Has he fabricated a lie against Allah, or is he mad?”<sup>5</sup> No, but those who do not believe in the Hereafter will be in the punishment, and they are extremely misguided.","[5] People knew that the Prophet (ﷺ) was the most truthful person, as he was known to be the wisest person among them too; so Allah did not refute these two baseless accusations; rather, He only made mention of their consequence of denying the life after death."
  34,9,"Do they not see all that is before them and all that is behind them of the heavens and earth? If We willed, We could cause the earth to swallow them up, or cause fragments of the sky to fall upon them. Indeed, there is a sign in this for every slave who turns to Allah in repentance.",""
  34,10,"Indeed, We bestowed favors upon David: “O mountains, echo Allah’s praise with him, and the birds too!” And We made iron malleable for him:",""
  34,11,"“Make coats of mail, and maintain balance in the linking rings, and do [all of you] righteous deeds, for I am All-Seeing of what you do.”",""
  34,12,"And to Solomon [We subdued] the wind: its morning course was a month’s journey and its evening course was a month’s journey. And We caused a stream of molten brass to flow for him, and there were some jinn who worked for him by his Lord’s permission; whoever among them deviated from Our command, We made him taste the punishment of the Blazing Fire.",""
  34,13,"They made for him whatever he wished of sanctuaries<sup>6</sup>, images<sup>7</sup>, basins as large as reservoirs, and huge fixed cooking pots. “Do [good deeds] in gratitude, O household of David!” But few of My slaves are grateful.”","[6] i.e., palaces, dwellings, or places of prayer.\n [7] Which were not prohibited at the time of Solomon (ﷺ)."
  34,14,"Then when We decreed Solomon’s death, nothing showed them that he was dead except a creature of the earth<sup>8</sup> eating away his staff<sup>9</sup>. When he fell down, the jinn realized that if they had truly known the unseen, they would not have remained in the debasing servitude<sup>10</sup>.","[8] i.e., a termite was gnawing his staff. [9] Upon which he was leaning.\n [10] It is proof that the jinn do not have knowledge of the unseen."
