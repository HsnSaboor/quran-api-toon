quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,249,"When Saul set out along with the troops, he said: “Allah will test you with a river: whoever drinks from it, he is not from me, and whoever does not drink from it, he is from me, except the one who scoops a little with his hand.” But they all drank from it, except a few of them. When Saul and those who believed with him crossed the river, they said: “We do not have power against Goliath and his troops today.” But those who were certain that they will meet Allah said: “How often has a small group overcome large groups with Allah’s permission! And Allah is with those who are patient.”",""
  2,250,"When they faced Goliath and his troops in combat, they said: “Our Lord, shower us with patience, make our feet firm, and give us victory over the disbelieving people.”",""
  2,251,"Thus they defeated them by Allah’s grace, and David killed Goliath, and Allah gave him the kingdom and wisdom and taught him whatever He willed<sup>139</sup>. Were it not for Allah to repel some people by others, the earth would be filled with corruption, but Allah is All-Gracious to the worlds.","[139] i.e., knowledge of prophethood and kingdom, and how to make body armor."
  2,252,"These are the verses of Allah that We recite to you [O Prophet] in truth, and you are truly one of the Messengers.",""
