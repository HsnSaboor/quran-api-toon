  39,68,"The Trumpet will be blown and all those in the heavens and all those on earth will fall dead, except whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on.",""
  39,69,"The earth<sup>20</sup> will shine with the light of its Lord, the record of deeds will be laid open, the prophets and the witnesses will be brought forth, and judgment will be passed between them with fairness, and they will not be wronged.","[20] It refers to the place where the judgment will be held on the Judgment Day."
  39,70,"Every soul will be paid in full for what it has done, for He knows best<sup>21</sup> what they do.","[21] In addition to its own knowledge of what it has done."
  39,71,"Those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups, until when they reach it, its gates will be opened and its keepers will say to them, “Did there not come to you messengers from among you, reciting the verses of your Lord and warning you of your meeting of this Day?” They will say, “Yes indeed, but the decree of punishment has come to pass against the disbelievers.”",""
  39,72,"It will be said, “Enter the gates of Hell, abiding therein forever.” What a terrible abode for the arrogant!",""

  39,74,"They will say, “All praise be to Allah Who has fulfilled His promise to us, and made us inherit the land<sup>22</sup> to dwell wherever we please in Paradise.” How excellent is the reward of those who do [good]!","[22] Allah will award Paradise to the believers to be its residents forever. See 21:105. Some commentators say that the word “inherit” is used because when Allah created Paradise and Hell, He made places for all humans in both. Those who go to Paradise will inherit the places of the disbelievers who go to Hell, and those who go to Hell will inherit the places of those who go to Paradise."
