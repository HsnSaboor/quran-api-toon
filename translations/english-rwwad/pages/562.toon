quran[12]{c,v,t,f}:
  67,1,"Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion, and He is Most Capable of all things.",""
  67,2,"Who created death and life to test you as to which of you is best in deeds, and He is the All-Mighty, the Most Forgiving.",""
  67,3,"Who created seven heavens one above another; you will not see any imperfection<sup>1</sup> in the creation of the Most Compassionate. Look again; can you see any flaw?","[1] All parts of the universe are well connected and in perfect harmony and coordination. There is no indiscipline, disorder and discordance in the universe, and nothing is disjointed and out of proportion in the creation of Allah. As for birth defects, genetic mutations and other things that we see in the world are part of this great creation, for perfection cannot be noticed except if the opposite is seen, also as a test for humans."
  67,4,"Then look again and again; your sight will turn back to you humbled and weary.",""
  67,5,"We have adorned the lowest heaven with lamps and have made them as missiles to stone the devils<sup>2</sup>, and We have prepared for them the punishment of the Blazing Fire.","[2] Preventing them thereby from eavesdropping in the heavens. See 72:8-10."
  67,6,"For those who disbelieve in their Lord there will be the punishment of Hell. What a terrible destination!",""
  67,7,"When they are thrown in it, they will hear its roaring as it boils up,",""
  67,8,"almost bursting in fury. Every time a group is thrown in it, its keepers will ask them, “Did there not come to you a warner?”",""
  67,9,"They will say, “Yes, a warner did come to us, but we denied and said, ‘Allah has not sent down anything; you are greatly misguided.’”",""
  67,10,"And they will say, “If only we had listened or understood, we would not be among the dwellers of the Blazing Fire.”",""
  67,11,"Thus they will confess their sins. So away<sup>3</sup> with the dwellers of the Blazing Fire!","[3] Away from all good and from the mercy of Allah."
  67,12,"Indeed, those who fear their Lord unseen will have forgiveness and a great reward.",""
