quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,73,"O Prophet, strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be harsh with them. Their abode is Hell. What a terrible destination!",""
  9,74,"They swear by Allah that they said nothing [blasphemous], while they indeed uttered a word of blasphemy<sup>61</sup>, and disbelieved after accepting Islam, and plotted what they could not achieve<sup>62</sup>. They are spiteful [against believers] for no reason except that Allah and His Messenger have enriched them out of His bounty. If they repent, it will be better for them, but if they turn away, Allah will chastise them with a painful punishment in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have on earth no protector or helper.","[61] such as insulting the Messenger (ﷺ) and attacking the religion.\n [62] They devised to assassinate the Prophet (ﷺ) upon his return from the Tabuk Expedition, but their plot was foiled."
  9,75,"There are some among them who made a covenant with Allah: “If He gives us out of His bounty, we will surely spend in charity and be among the righteous.”",""
  9,76,"But when He did give them out of His bounty, they grew stingy and turned away in aversion.",""
  9,77,"So as a consequence, He caused hypocrisy to take root in their hearts until the Day they meet Him, because of breaking their promise to Allah, and because of their persistent lying.",""
  9,78,"Do they not know that Allah knows their secret and private conversations and that Allah is the All-Knower of all unseen?",""
  9,79,"Those who disparage the believers who voluntarily give charities and ridicule them for having nothing to give except their effort<sup>63</sup>. Allah will ridicule them, and for them there will be a painful punishment.","[63] They hurtle sneering comments on both the well-off who give generously, saying that they do so out of show off, and those who can only help with the very little they have, and deride them for it."
