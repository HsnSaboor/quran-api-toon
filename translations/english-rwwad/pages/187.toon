quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,1,"[This is] a declaration of disassociation<sup>1</sup> by Allah and His Messenger to those polytheists with whom you have made a treaty.","[1] This surah, unlike all surahs of the Qur’an, is not preceded by al-basmalah (the usual opening statement)."
  9,2,"“Therefore move freely in the land<sup>2</sup> for four months, but know that you cannot escape Allah and that Allah will humiliate the disbelievers.”","[2] They were encouraged to repent or find a safe place to depart to."
  9,3,"A declaration from Allah and His Messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage<sup>3</sup>, that Allah and His Messenger are free from obligation to the polytheists. If you repent, it is better for you, but if you turn away, then know that you cannot escape Allah<sup>4</sup>. And give the disbelievers tidings of a painful punishment.","[3] Hajj; ‘Umrah is a minor pilgrimage. [4] i.e., you cannot escape His punishment."
  9,4,"Except those polytheists with whom you have a treaty and who have not broken it in the least, nor have backed up anyone against you – so fulfill your treaty with them until the end of their term<sup>5</sup>. Indeed, Allah loves those who fear Him.","[5] This is an exception from the four months reprieve."
  9,5,"Then when the [four] sacred months<sup>6</sup> are over, kill the polytheists wherever you find them, seize them, besiege them and lie in wait for them on every route<sup>7</sup>. But if they repent, establish prayers and give zakah, then set them free, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful<sup>8</sup>.","[6] i.e., Muharram, Rajab, Dhul-Qa‘dah and Dhul-Hijjah.\n [7] Some prominent scholars of Islam are of the opinion that this applies especially to combatant disbelievers who pose a threat to Muslims.\n [8] The next few verses reveal who these really are and why they deserve such retaliatory measures."
  9,6,"If any of the polytheists asks you for protection, give it to him, so that he may hear the Word of Allah<sup>9</sup>, then escort him to his place of safety; that is because they are a people who do not know.","[9] Because their belligerence and animosity stem from their ignorance about Islam."
