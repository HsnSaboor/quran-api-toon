quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,283,"If you are on a journey and find no scribe, then something should be taken as collateral. But if you trust one another, then the debtor should fulfill his trust, and let him fear Allah, his Lord. Do not conceal the testimony, for anyone who conceals it has a sinful heart, and Allah is All-Knowing of what you do.",""
  2,284,"To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth. Whether you reveal what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills, for Allah is Most Capable of all things.",""
  2,285,"The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, as do the believers. All of them believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, and His messengers, [saying], “We make no distinction between any of His messengers.” And they say, “We hear and obey. Grant us Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the [final] destination.”",""
  2,286,"Allah does not burden any soul greater than it can bear. For it is what it has earned, and against it is what it has incurred. “Our Lord, do not hold us accountable if we forget or fall into error. Our Lord, do not place on us such a burden as You have placed on those before us. Our Lord, do not burden us with that which we cannot bear. Pardon us, forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our Protector, so give us victory over the disbelieving people<sup>173</sup>.”<sup>174</sup>","[173] Allah Almighty concludes this Surah by directing His servants how to supplicate Him, just as He taught them in Surah al-Fātihah how to praise Him and ask for guidance. [174] Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) said: ""Whosoever recited the last two verses of Surat al-Baqarah at night, that will be sufficient for him."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 345]"
