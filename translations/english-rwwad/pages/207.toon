quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,123,"O you who believe, fight those disbelievers who are around you<sup>89</sup>, and let them find harshness in you; and know that Allah is with those who fear Him.","[89] Ensuring that the borders are secure and the enemy does not think of attacking Muslims."
  9,124,"Whenever a Chapter is sent down, some of those [hypocrites] say, “Which of you has had his Faith increased by it<sup>90</sup>?” As for those who believe, it does increase them in faith and they rejoice.","[90] They flippantly did so to ridicule the believers."
  9,125,"But as for those in whose hearts is sickness, it only increases them in wickedness<sup>91</sup> to their wickedness, and they will die while they are disbelievers.","[91] Lit, ""filth,"" i.e., hypocrisy and disbelief."
  9,126,"Do they not see that they are put to trial once or twice every year? Yet they neither repent nor do they take heed.",""
  9,127,"Whenever a Chapter is revealed, they look at one another [saying], “Is anyone watching you?” Then they slip away<sup>92</sup>. Allah has turned their hearts away because they are a people who do not understand.","[92] They would exchange glances as if saying to one another: “Who is this person who sees you while you plot in secret and tells Muhammad (ﷺ) about it?” Instead of paying heed, they would turn away reverting to their ways."
  9,128,"There has come to you a Messenger from among yourselves; he is grieved by your suffering, and is concerned for you, and is gracious and merciful towards the believers<sup>93</sup>.","[93] The Messenger (ﷺ) was keen on guiding people and teaching them all that is good, particularly the believers."
  9,129,"But if they turn away, then say, “Allah is sufficient for me; none has the right to be worshiped except Him<sup>94</sup>; in Him I put my trust, and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.”","[94] The surah ends with a comforting note to the Messenger (ﷺ) in the face of all stiff opposition and resistance, to seek support in Allah and find solace in these words."
