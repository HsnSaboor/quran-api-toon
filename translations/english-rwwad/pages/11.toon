  2,70,"They again said, “Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is. All cows look alike to us. If Allah wills, we will surely be guided.”",""
  2,71,"He said, “Allah says, ‘It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor water the field; sound, without blemish.’” They said, “Now you have come with the truth.” Then they slaughtered it, although they were almost not doing it.",""
  2,72,"And [remember] when you [Israelites] slew a man and disputed as to who the killer was, but Allah exposed what you were concealing.",""
  2,73,"We said, “Strike the slain with a piece of it.” This is how Allah brings the dead to life and shows you His signs, so that you may understand.",""
  2,74,"Then your hearts became hardened after that, like rocks or even harder. There are rocks from which rivers gush forth, and there are others that split open from which water comes out, while others fall down out of humility to Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.",""
  2,75,"Do you [O believers] hope that they would respond to your call to believe, while a party of them used to hear the word of Allah<sup>35</sup> then distort it knowingly after understanding it?","[35] i.e., the Torah."
  2,76,"And when they meet the believers they say, “We believe.” But when they<sup>36</sup> meet one another in private they say, “Are you telling them what Allah has revealed to you [about Mohammad], so that they may argue against you before your Lord? Have you no sense?”","[36] i.e., the Jews."
