quran[11]{c,v,t,f}:
  17,105,"With the truth We have sent down this [Qur’an] and with the truth it has descended<sup>84</sup>, and We have not sent you [O Prophet] except as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner.","[84] It is repeated twice in the face of the ardent denial of the pagans of Makkah and their demand to provide them with miracles, asserting here that the Qur’an is a revelation from Allah: it contains truthful news and just rulings, as it is sent down by Gabriel (عليه السلام), the strong and trustworthy, to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), safeguarded against the devils, free from alteration, additions or omission, throughout all times."
  17,106,"This is a Qur’an that We have revealed over stages so that you may recite it to people at a slower pace, and We have sent it down in a successive manner<sup>85</sup>.","[85] In separate segments, one coming after another over the duration of 23 years of his mission."
  17,107,"Say, “Believe in it, or do not believe. Those who were given knowledge before it<sup>86</sup>, when it is recited to them, they fall on their faces in prostration,","[86] Of the People of the Book who recognize the truth."
  17,108,"and they say, “Glory be to our Lord. The promise of our Lord is bound to be fulfilled.”",""
  17,109,"They fall down on their faces weeping, and it increases their humility.”",""
  17,110,"Say, “Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Compassionate<sup>87</sup> – whichever name you call, to Him belong the Most Beautiful Names.” Do not be too loud in your prayer, nor too quiet, but seek a way in between<sup>88</sup>.","[87] The Makkans heard the Prophet (ﷺ) praying to Allah, once as Allah and on another occasion as Al-Rahmān, and claimed that he was praying to two different gods. [Majmū‘ al-Fatāwā, Ibn Taymiyyah, 14:15] Both are two Names for Allah, the One and Only God.\n [88] Abdullāh ibn Abbās (رضي الله عنهما) reported the reason behind the revelation of this verse: “It came down when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was lying low in Makkah. When he used to lead his Companions in Prayer and raise his voice and the pagans heard him, they would curse the Qur’an and He Who sent it down. So Allah said to His Messenger: “Do not raise your voice is Prayer upon which the pagans would hear you, yet not too quiet that your Companions may not hear you. Make them hear the Qur’an but do not raise your voice to that extent; seeking a middle way between them.” [Al-Bukhārī: 4722; Muslim: 446]."
  17,111,"And say, “All praise is for Allah Who has not taken a son, nor does He have any partner in His dominion, nor does He need any protector out of weakness. And proclaim His greatness immensely.”",""
  18,1,"All praise be to Allah Who has sent down upon His slave the Book, and has not allowed any crookedness therein<sup>1</sup>,","[1] From the straight path or from the truth."
  18,2,"an upright Book, to warn of severe punishment from Him<sup>2</sup>, and to give glad tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds, that they will have a good reward,","[2] i.e., a painful punishment that awaits them in the Hereafter, and in this life such as in the battle at the hands of the believers."
  18,3,"wherein they will abide forever;",""
  18,4,"and to warn those who say, “Allah has begotten a son<sup>3</sup>.”","[3] Such as the Jews and Christians, and the Arab pagans who claimed that angels are Allah’s daughters."
