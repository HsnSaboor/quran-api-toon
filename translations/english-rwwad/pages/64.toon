quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,109,"To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, and to Allah will return all matters.",""
  3,110,"You are the best nation ever raised for mankind: you enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and believe in Allah. If the People of the Book had believed, it would have been better for them. Some of them are believers, but most of them are rebellious.",""
  3,111,"They can never harm you except for some annoyance. But if they fight you, they will turn their backs, then they will not be helped.",""
  3,112,"They are afflicted with humiliation wherever they may be<sup>53</sup>, unless they are protected by a covenant from Allah or a treaty from the people. They have incurred Allah’s wrath and are afflicted with destitution. That is because they disbelieved in Allah’s verses and killed the prophets unjustly. That is because of their disobedience and transgression.","[53] This fate was imposed on the Jews by Allah, in part, in fulfillment of the divine promise to punish them severely, as found in 3:21."
  3,113,"Yet all are not alike: there are some among the People of the Book who are upright<sup>54</sup>; they recite the verses of Allah during the night and they prostrate.","[54] Those of them who accepted Islam, like Abdullah ibn Salām."
  3,114,"They believe in Allah and the Last Day; enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong; and hasten in doing good deeds. They are among the righteous.",""
  3,115,"Whatever good they do, their reward will never be denied; for Allah is All-Knowing of those who are righteous.",""
