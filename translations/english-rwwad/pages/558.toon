quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  65,1,"O Prophet, when you [believers] divorce women, divorce them with concern to their waiting period and keep an accurate count of the waiting period<sup>1</sup>, and fear Allah, your Lord. Do not force them out of their houses, nor should they leave unless they commit a clear shameful act. Such are the limits ordained by Allah. Whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allah has truly wronged himself. You never know, perhaps Allah will bring about a change [of heart] later<sup>2</sup>.","[1] A wife should only be divorced after the completion of her monthly cycle and before sexual intercourse after purity, or else during a confirmed pregnancy. Her waiting period (‘iddah) begins with the pronouncement of divorce. See 2:228-233.\n [2] Such as regret for divorcing or renewed desire for the wife."
  65,2,"Then when they have approached the end of their waiting period, either retain them honorably or part with them honorably<sup>3</sup>. Call two just men from among yourselves as witnesses, and give true testimony for the sake of Allah. This is an exhortation for those who believe in Allah and the Last Day. Whoever fears Allah, He will make a way out for him<sup>4</sup>,","[3] A husband may return to his wife after the first or the second divorce (revocable divorce) or at the end of her waiting period with dignity. If he divorces her a third time, the marriage is terminated at the end of her third waiting period (Irrevocable divorce). The wife will have to marry and get divorced by another man before she can remarry her ex-husband. See 2:230.\n [4] i.e., relief from distress and inconvenience."
  65,3,"and He will provide for him from where he does not expect. Whoever puts his trust in Allah, He is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allah will surely accomplish His purpose, for Allah has set a destiny for everything.",""
  65,4,"As for those women from among you who reached their menopause, in case you doubt, their waiting period is three months, as well as of those who have not yet menstruated. As for pregnant women, their waiting period ends with delivery<sup>5</sup>. And whoever fears Allah, He will make his matters easy for him.","[5] This ruling for the waiting period of pregnant women applies also in case the husband dies."
  65,5,"This is the commandment of Allah that He has sent down to you. Whoever fears Allah, He will absolve him of his bad deeds and will reward him immensely.",""
