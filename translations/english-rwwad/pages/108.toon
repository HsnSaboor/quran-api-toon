quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,6,"O you who believe, when you rise up for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands up to the elbows; wipe over your heads; and wash your feet up to the ankles. If you are in a state of major impurity, cleanse yourselves [by taking a bath]. But if you are ill, on a journey, or have relieved yourselves, or had sexual contact<sup>11</sup> with women and find no water, then purify yourselves with clean earth<sup>12</sup>, and wipe your faces and hands therewith. Allah does not want to impose hardship on you, rather He wants to purify you and complete His favor upon you, so that you may be grateful.","[11] i.e., had sexual intercourse or seminal discharge.\n [12] This is the act of dry ablution or tayammum."
  5,7,"Remember Allah’s favor upon you, and His covenant that He made with you when you said, “We hear and obey.” And fear Allah, for Allah is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts.",""
  5,8,"O you who believe, stand firm for Allah by bearing true testimony, and do not let the hatred of a people lead you away from justice. Be just; that is closer to righteousness. And fear Allah, for Allah is All-Aware of what you do.",""
  5,9,"Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have forgiveness and a great reward.",""
