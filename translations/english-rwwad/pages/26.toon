  2,170,"When it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has sent down,” they say, “Instead, we follow what we found our forefathers doing.” [Would they do so] even though their forefathers had no understanding, nor were they guided?",""
  2,171,"The similitude of those who disbelieved is like cattle not understanding the calls of the shepherd except shouts and cries. They are deaf, dumb, and blind<sup>75</sup>; and they understand nothing.","[75] Their senses are not tuned to divine admonition."
  2,172,"O you who believe, eat of the good things<sup>76</sup> We have provided for you, and be grateful to Allah, if you truly worship Him alone.","[76] Healthy and wholesome."
  2,173,"He has only forbidden to you carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, and what has been sacrificed to other than Allah. But if someone is compelled by necessity – neither driven by desire nor exceeding immediate need – then there is no sin upon him; for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  2,174,"Those who conceal the revelation of Allah’s Book and purchase thereby a small price, consume nothing into their bellies except fire. Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them, and for them there will be a painful punishment.",""
  2,175,"They are those who trade guidance for misguidance and forgiveness for punishment. How patient they must be to withstand the Fire<sup>77</sup>!","[77] Allah is mocking their ignorance for exchanging bliss of Paradise with punishment of Hellfire."
  2,176,"That is because Allah has sent down the Book in truth. And those who differ over the Book are surely in extreme dissension.",""
