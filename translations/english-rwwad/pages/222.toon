quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  11,6,"There is no moving creature on earth but upon Allah is its provision. He knows its place of dwelling and its place of rest<sup>4</sup>; everything is [written] in a clear Record.","[4] Before birth and after death."
  11,7,"It is He Who created the heavens and earth in six Days – and His Throne was upon the water – so that He may test you as to which of you is best in deed. But if you say to them, “You will certainly be raised after death,” the disbelievers will surely say, “This is nothing but clear magic!”",""
  11,8,"If We delay their punishment for a limited time, they will surely say<sup>5</sup>, “What is holding it back?” Indeed, the day when it comes upon them, it will not be averted from them, and they will be encompassed by what they used to ridicule.","[5] In ridicule and disbelief."
  11,9,"If We give man a taste of Our mercy, then take it away from him, he becomes utterly despaired and ungrateful.",""
  11,10,"But if We give him a taste of prosperity after being afflicted with hardship, he will surely say, “All my ills are gone,” and he becomes exultant and boastful,",""
  11,11,"except those who are patient and do righteous deeds; it is they who will have forgiveness and a great reward.",""
  11,12,"Perhaps you may disregard some of what is revealed to you [O Prophet]<sup>6</sup>, and may feel distressed because they say, “Why has not a treasure been sent down to him, or why has not an angel come with him?” You are only a warner<sup>7</sup>, and Allah is in charge of all things.","[6] i.e., things that they may find arduous to act upon. [7] The Prophet (ﷺ) is tasked only to deliver the message, not to fulfill their whimsical wishes."
