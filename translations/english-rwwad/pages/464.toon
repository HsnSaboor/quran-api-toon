The only unforgivable sin in Islam is dying in disbelief in Allah or associating others with Him. See 4:48. The Prophet (ﷺ) reports that Allah Almighty says, ""O children of Adam! As long as you call upon Me, putting your hope in Me, I will forgive you for what you have done, and I will not mind. O children of Adam! If your sins were to reach the clouds of the sky and then you sought My forgiveness, I would forgive you. O children of Adam! If you were to come to Me with sins filling the whole world and then you came to Me without associating partners with Me, I would certainly match your sins with forgiveness."" [At-Tirmidhi]"
