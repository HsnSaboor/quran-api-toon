quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,45,"But Allah knows best your enemies. Allah is sufficient as a Protector, and Allah is sufficient as a Helper.",""
  4,46,"Among the Jews are those who distort the words taking them out of context, and say, “We hear and disobey,” and “Hear! May you never hear,” and “Rā‘ina,” [i.e., hearken to us]<sup>32</sup> – twisting their tongues and insulting the religion. If they had said, “We hear and obey,” and “Hear,” and “Wait for us,” it would have been better for them and more proper. But Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so only a few of them will believe.","[32] Some of the Madinan Jews used to address the Prophet (ﷺ) by subtly twisting their tongues when uttering rā‘inā to mean: “You are foolish!”"
  4,47,"O you who were given the Scripture, believe in what We have sent down [to Muhammad] – confirming your own Scriptures – before We obliterate faces turning them backward, or We curse them<sup>33</sup> as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers. For Allah’s will is always executed.","[33] This verse is a severe warning to the Jews and Christians that they must believe in Allah’s Messenger Muhammad (ﷺ) and in this Qur’an."
  4,48,"Allah does not forgive associating partners with Him<sup>34</sup>, but forgives anything less than that for whom He wills. Whoever associates partners with Allah has indeed committed a grave sin.","[34] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""Allah will say to that person of the Hellfire who will receive the least punishment, ‘If you had everything on the earth, would you give it as a ransom to free yourself?’ He will say, `Yes’. Then Allah will say, ‘While you were in the backbone of Adam, I asked you much less than this, (i.e., not to worship others besides Me), but you insisted on worshiping others besides me.’"" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 551]"
  4,49,"Have you not seen those who claim purity for themselves<sup>35</sup>? It is Allah Who purifies whom He wills, and they will not be wronged even as much as the thread on a date stone.","[35] Those are the Jews who say: “We are the children of Allah and His beloved ones!” (5:18); “The Fire will not touch us except for a limited number of days!” (2:80)."
  4,50,"See how they fabricate lies about Allah<sup>36</sup>! This in itself is sufficient as a flagrant sin.","[36] By falsely praising themselves and claiming honor."
  4,51,"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture, who believe in idols<sup>37</sup> and Tāghoot [i.e., false gods]<sup>38</sup>, and they say to the disbelievers that they are more guided than the believers<sup>39</sup>?","[37] al-Jibt: all sorts of false things and everything that is worshiped besides Allah.\n [38] al-Tāghūt: taken from ṭughyān, i.e. transgression and wrongdoing. All that transgresses against Allah. Anyone who condones being worshiped besides Allah is a ṭāghūt.\n [39] Ibn ‘Abbās (رضي الله عنهما) reported: “When (the Jewish scholar) Ka‘b ibn al-Ashraf came to Makkah, the Quraysh asked him: “You are the best of the people of Madinah and their master. Aren’t you?” He replied: “Yes!” They then said: “What do you think of this sonless outcast (meaning Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) claiming that he is better than us when we are the custodians of pilgrims and the caretakers of the House of Allah!” He said: “You are indeed better than him!” Then the following verses were revealed: “Indeed, your hater is the one cut off”, (108: 3) and (5: 51- 52)”. [Al-Nasā’ī, Al-Sunan al-Kubrā: 11707; Ibn Ḥibbān: 6572]"
