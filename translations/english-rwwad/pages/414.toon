  31,32,"When they are overwhelmed by waves like canopies, they cry out to Allah in sincere devotion to Him alone, but when He delivers them to the land, only some of them take a middle course [in faith]<sup>11</sup>.

Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.","[12] i.e., the time of its occurrence.\n [13] Abdullah ibn Mas‘ūd reported that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, “The creation of each one of you is brought together in the womb of his mother as a drop of discharges for forty days, then it becomes a clinging clot of blood for a similar period, then a lump of flesh for a similar period. Then an angel is sent to blow life into the embryo. Then the angel is commanded to write four things: his destined provisions, lifespan, actions, and whether he will be happy or miserable.” [Al-Bukhāri and Muslim]\n [14] i.e., its timing, its quantity, its location, etc."
