quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  33,36,"It is not for a believing man or woman – when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter – to have any other choice in their matter<sup>29</sup>. Whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has clearly gone astray.","[29] i.e., to seek judgment from anyone else, or to have a choice to accept or reject it."
  33,37,"And [remember, O Prophet] when you were saying to the one<sup>30</sup> who was favored by Allah<sup>31</sup> and favored by you<sup>32</sup>, “Keep your wife and fear Allah.” You were concealing in your heart what Allah was going to reveal<sup>33</sup>, and you were fearing people<sup>34</sup>, while it was more fitting that you should fear Allah<sup>35</sup>. When Zayd no longer had desire for her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there would be no restraint for the believers in marrying the ex-wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have desire for them. And Allah’s decree is bound to be fulfilled.","[30] It refers to the Prophet's adopted son, Zayd ibn Hārithah, before the adoption was abolished.\n [31] By guiding him to Islam.\n [32] By emancipating him from bondage.\n [33] i.e., the command of Allah to the Prophet (ﷺ) to marry Zaynab bint Jahsh after Zayd divorced her; in order to make clear to people that a man can marry a woman previously married to his adopted son.\n [34] i.e., fear that people may say that he married the former wife of his adopted son.\n [35] By making Allah’s command known to people."
  33,38,"There is no blame on the Prophet concerning what Allah has made lawful for him<sup>36</sup>. Such was the way of Allah with those [prophets] who came before. And Allah’s command is a decree firmly determined,","[36] Concerning the Prophet’s (ﷺ) marriage with Zaynab bint Jahsh."
  33,39,"those who convey the messages of Allah<sup>37</sup> and fear Him, and they do not fear anyone except Allah. And sufficient is Allah as a Reckoner.","[37] i.e., the prophets and their followers who honestly convey Allah’s message to the people."
  33,40,"Muhammad is not the father of any of your men<sup>38</sup>, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the seal of the prophets. And Allah is All-Knowing of everything.","[38] Muhammad (ﷺ) is not the father of any men, neither Zaid (previously mentioned in verse 37) nor any other men. He (ﷺ) had three biological sons: Qāsim, Ibrāhim, and Abdullah; all of them died in their childhood."
  33,41,"O you who believe, remember Allah much,",""
  33,42,"and glorify Him morning and evening.",""
  33,43,"It is He Who confers blessings upon you<sup>39</sup>, and His angels pray for you, so that He may bring you out of the depths of darkness into the light. And He is Most Merciful to the believers.","[39] i.e., He praises you in the presence of the angels."
