quran[10]{c,v,t,f}:
  24,44,"Allah alternates the night and day. Indeed, there is a lesson in this for people of insight.",""
  24,45,"Allah created every living creature from water. Some of them move on their bellies, and some walk on two legs and some walk on four. Allah creates what He wills. Allah is the Most Capable of all things.",""
  24,46,"We have sent down verses making things clear, and Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path.",""
  24,47,"The hypocrites say, “We believe in Allah and in the Messenger, and we obey.” Then a party of them turns away after that. Such are not believers.",""
  24,48,"When they are called to Allah and His Messenger so that he may judge between them, a party of them turns away.",""
  24,49,"But if the right is in their favor, they come to him in full submission<sup>29</sup>.","[29] For they care for their own interests and desires, not submission to the right judgment."
  24,50,"Is there sickness in their hearts, or do they have doubt, or do they fear that Allah and His messenger will be unjust to them? Rather, it is they who are the wrongdoers.",""
  24,51,"As for the believers, when they are called to Allah and His Messenger so that he may judge between them, they say, “We listen and obey.” It is they who are successful.",""
  24,52,"Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, and fears Allah and is conscious of Him – it is they who are the triumphant.",""
  24,53,"The hypocrites swear by Allah their most solemn oaths that if you order them, they will surely march forth. Say, “Do not swear, [your] obedience is well known<sup>30</sup>. Allah is All-Aware of what you do.”","[30] This is said in a sarcastic way; i.e., your obedience is well known to be a lie."
