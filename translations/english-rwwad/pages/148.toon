quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,147,"But if they reject you [O Prophet], then say, “Your Lord is the possessor of infinite mercy, but His punishment cannot be averted from the wicked people.”",""
  6,148,"Those who associate partners with Allah will say, “If Allah had willed, neither we nor our forefathers would have associated anything with Him, nor would we have made anything forbidden<sup>53</sup>.” Likewise, those who came before them rejected the truth until they tasted Our punishment. Say, “Do you have any knowledge that you can present to us? You follow nothing but assumption and you do nothing but lie.","[53] They falsely argue by citing predestination (al-qadar), when they were given the choice of choosing the right or wrong path."
  6,149,"Say, “Allah alone has the most conclusive argument. If He had willed, He could have guided you all.”",""
  6,150,"Say [O Prophet], “Bring your witnesses who can testify that Allah has forbidden all this.” If they testify, do not testify with them. Do not follow the desires of those who reject Our verses, and who disbelieve in the Hereafter, and they set up equals to their Lord.",""
  6,151,"Say [O Prophet], “Come, I will recite to you what your Lord has forbidden to you: do not associate any partners with Him<sup>54</sup>, and honor your parents. Do not kill your children for fear of poverty, for We provide for you and for them. Do not approach shameful acts, whether openly or in secret. Do not kill the soul sanctified by Allah, except lawfully. This is what He commands you, so that you may understand.","[54] Monotheism (tawhīd) is the fountainhead of all virtue, whereas associating others with Allah (shirk) is the source of all evil."
