  12,31,"When she heard of their gossip, she invited them and arranged for them a banquet, gave each one of them a knife, and said [to Joseph], “Come out before them.” When they saw him, they were so stunned<sup>12</sup> that they cut their hands, and said, “Great God! This cannot be human; this must be a noble angel.”","[12] In the long Hadith of the Nocturnal Journey and Ascension (al-isrā’ wa al-mi‘rāj), Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) described Prophet Joseph (عليه السلام) when he met him as a man who is “Endowed with half of all human handsomeness.” [cf. Muslim: 162]"
  12,32,"She said, “This is the one for whose love you reproached me. I did try to seduce him but he abstained. If he does not follow my order, he will surely be imprisoned and will be fully humiliated.”",""
  12,33,"Joseph said, “My Lord, I would rather be in prison than that to which they are calling me. Unless you protect me from their guile, I may succumb to them and fall into ignorance.”",""

  12,35,"Then it occurred to them after they saw the signs [of his innocence] that they should imprison him for some time<sup>13</sup>.","[13] so that the scandal be forgotten."

Tell us their interpretation<sup>14</sup>, for we see you as one of those who do good.”","[14] Interpretation of the dreams of his jail mates was the reason behind his victorious release and appointment as Chief Minister."
  12,37,"Joseph said, “Before there comes to you the meal which you will be given, I will inform you of their interpretation. This is part of what my Lord has taught me. I have renounced the faith of people who do not believe in Allah and who deny the Hereafter.",""
