quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,37,"They will wish to get out of the Fire, but they will never get out of it, and for them there will be an everlasting punishment.",""
  5,38,"As for the thief, male or female, amputate their hands as a deterrent punishment<sup>35</sup> from Allah for what they have done. Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.","[35] Nakāl (deterrence) is penalization set as an example for others; it is called nakāl because it deters both the perpetrator and others from committing it."
  5,39,"But whoever repents after having committed wrong and mends his way, Allah will accept his repentance, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  5,40,"Do you not know that the dominion of the heavens and earth belongs to Allah? He punishes whom He wills and forgives whom He wills, and Allah is Most Capable of all things.",""
  5,41,"O Messenger, do not grieve for those who rush to disbelief – those who say with their mouths, “We believe”, but their hearts have no faith, nor those Jews who eagerly listen to falsehood and to those who have not yet come to you<sup>36</sup>. They distort the words [of Allah] out of their context saying, “If you are given this [ruling] accept it<sup>37</sup>, but if you are not given, then beware<sup>38</sup>.” Whoever Allah wills to be misguided<sup>39</sup>, there is nothing you can do to avail him against Allah. They are those whose hearts Allah did not will to purify. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter they will suffer a great punishment.","[36] They had not attended the Prophet's gatherings or heard his words.\n [37] The legal ruling desired by them.\n [38] They heed the words of warning of other conniving men who were so averse that they did not go to the Prophet (ﷺ) to hear what he had to say.\n [39] The meaning here is misbelief, misconception, or self-delusion as a result of one's own refusal of truth."
