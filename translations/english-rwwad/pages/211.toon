quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  10,21,"When We give people a taste of mercy after being afflicted with adversity, they start plotting against Our verses. Say, “Allah is swifter in planning [retribution]. Our angel-messengers record whatever you plot.”",""
  10,22,"It is He Who enables you to travel through the land and sea, until when you are in the ships and they sail with those on board and rejoicing in a favorable wind, then suddenly a stormy wind comes, with waves crashing into them on all sides, and they feel that there is no escape. Then they cry out to Allah<sup>24</sup> with sincere devotion to Him, “If You save us from this, we will surely be among those who are grateful.”","[24] The journey of life is vulnerable and precarious, which is analogous to a sea voyage, where people ride and are not sure when the tide will turn against them. It is out of Allah’s grace that keeps them safe from the woes and perils of life."
  10,23,"However, when He saves them, they start transgressing in the land unjustly<sup>25</sup>. O people, your transgression is against your own souls. Take your little enjoyment in this life; then to Us is your return, and We will inform you of what you used to do.","[25] By disbelief, associating false deities with Allah and committing sins."
  10,24,"The likeness of the life of this world is that of the rain that We send down from the sky, and it mixes with the plants of the earth, from which both humans and livestock eat. Then when the earth is in its splendor and its fairest appearance, and its owners feel that they have full control over it, Our command comes to it, by night or by day, and We reduce it to stubble, as if it had not flourished the day before<sup>26</sup>. This is how We make the signs clear for people who reflect.","[26] The precariousness of life and its transient nature has been depicted beautifully here through potent analogy, so that people may realize that life is nothing but an illusory enjoyment, which will soon come to an abrupt end by death, but the Hereafter is the real and everlasting life."
  10,25,"Allah invites to the Home of Peace<sup>27</sup> and guides whom He wills to a straight path.","[27] i.e., Paradise."
