quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,135,"They say, “Be Jews or Christians to be guided.” Say, “Rather [we follow] the religion of Abraham, the monotheist, and he was not one of the polytheists<sup>58</sup>.”","[58] i.e., those who associate others with Allah in worship."
  2,136,"Say [O believers], “We believe in Allah and what has been sent down to us; and what was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the descendants [of Jacob]<sup>59</sup>; and what was given to Moses and Jesus; and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted.”","[59] i.e., the twelve tribes of Israel descended from Jacob."
  2,137,"If they believe as you have believed, then they are guided. But if they turn away, then they are in plain dissension. Allah will suffice you against them, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.",""
  2,138,"This is the natural religion<sup>60</sup> of Allah. Who is better than Allah in [enjoining a] religion? And it is He Whom we worship.","[60] “Sibghah” linguistically means ‘color’. It is so called because religious devoutness shows on the person as much as a dye of cloth shows on it."
  2,139,"Say, “Do you [People of the Book] argue with us concerning Allah, when He is our Lord and your Lord? We are responsible for our deeds and you for yours, and we are sincerely devoted to Him.",""
  2,140,"Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the descendants [of Jacob] were Jews or Christians?” Say, “Are you more knowledgeable or Allah?” Who does greater wrong than the one who hides a testimony he has from Allah? But Allah is not unaware of what you do.",""
  2,141,"That was a nation that has passed on; they will have what they earned and you will have what you earned, and you will not be questioned concerning what they used to do.",""
