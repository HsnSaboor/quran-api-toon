quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  57,12,"[Remember] the Day when you will see the believing men and women, with their light streaming ahead of them and on their right. [They will be told], “Glad tidings for you Today: gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever.” That is the supreme triumph.",""
  57,13,"On that Day the hypocrite men and women will say to those who believe, “Wait for us, so that we may have some of your light.” It will be said, “Go back and seek light elsewhere<sup>11</sup>.” Then a wall will be placed between them, which will have a gate<sup>12</sup>, on the inside of which there will be mercy and on the outside there will be punishment.","[11] i.e., the worldly life from where the light was acquired. [12] This wall is said to be the barrier between Paradise and Hell, which is called Al-A‘rāf (the heights). See 7:46-49."
  57,14,"The hypocrites will call out to the believers, “Were we not with you?” They will say, “Yes, but you allowed yourselves<sup>13</sup> to succumb to temptations, you awaited [some misfortune to befall us], you doubted, and you were deceived by false hopes, until Allah’s decree came to pass. Thus the deceiver [i.e., Satan] deceived you concerning Allah.","[13] By hypocrisy."
  57,15,"So this Day no ransom will be accepted from you or from the disbelievers. Your abode is the Fire; it is a fitting place for you – what a wretched destination!”",""
  57,16,"Has the time not yet come for those who believe that their hearts should be humbled at the remembrance of Allah and the truth that has been revealed? And that they should not be like those who were given the Scripture before, whose hearts grew hard after the passage of a long time, and many of them were evildoers.",""
  57,17,"Know that Allah revives the earth after its death<sup>14</sup>. We have made the signs clear to you so that you may understand.","[14] Similarly, it is easy for Allah to soften the hearts and guide after misguidance."
  57,18,"Indeed, those men and women who give in charity and lend to Allah a goodly loan, it will be multiplied for them, and for them there will be a generous reward<sup>15</sup>.","[15] i.e., Paradise."
