quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,148,"Allah does not like offensive words<sup>101</sup> to be said in public except by one who has been wronged. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.","[101] i.e., swearing, foul mouthing, being profane, hurling accusations, slandering, backbiting, etc."
  4,149,"If you do something good openly or in secret, or pardon an offense<sup>102</sup>, then Allah is indeed Ever-Pardoning, Most Capable.","[102] This is mainly addressed to the one who is wronged."
  4,150,"Those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers, and wish to make a distinction between Allah and His messengers, and they say, “We believe in some and disbelieve in others,” wishing to adopt a way in between.",""
  4,151,"It is they who are the true disbelievers, and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.",""
  4,152,"But those who believe in Allah and His messengers, and make no distinction between any of them, they will be given their rewards. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  4,153,"The People of the Book ask you to bring down upon them a Book from heaven<sup>103</sup>. They had asked Moses even greater than that when they said, “Show us Allah openly.” But they were struck with a thunderbolt for their transgression. Then they took the calf for worship after receiving clear signs, yet We pardoned them, and We gave Moses compelling proof.","[103] This demand and all of the other Israelite infringements mentioned here are detailed in Surat al-Baqarah. See 2:50-66."
  4,154,"And We raised above them the Mount [to remind them] of their covenant, and We said to them, “Enter the gate [of Jerusalem] lowering your heads<sup>104</sup>”, and said to them: “Do not break the Sabbath”, and We took from them a solemn covenant.","[104] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""It was said to Bani Israel, ‘Enter the gate (of the town) bowing with humility and say: ‘Repentance’, but they changed the word and entered crawling on their buttocks and said: ‘A wheat grain in the hair’."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 615]. They said so just to ridicule Allah’s order, as they were disobedient to Him. So Allah punished them severely, most probably with a plague."
