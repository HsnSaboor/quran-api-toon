  60,10,"O you who believe, when the believing women come to you as migrants, test their sincerity, although Allah knows best about their faith. Then if you find them to be believers, do not send them back to the disbelievers; they are not lawful [wives] for them, nor are they lawful [husbands] for them. But give the disbelievers whatever [dowries] they have spent<sup>4</sup>. And there is no blame on you if you marry them, as long as you give them their dowries. Do not hold on to the marriage ties with the disbelieving women<sup>5</sup>; ask for repayment of whatever [dowries] you have spent, and let the disbelievers ask for repayment of whatever [dowries] they have spent<sup>6</sup>. This is the ruling of Allah that He judges between you, and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.","[4] i.e., compensate for their loss. [5] i.e., do not stop them from joining the disbelievers.\n [6] If a disbelieving wife opted to join the disbelievers, a Muslim husband could demand in return the equivalent of her dowries. Similarly, the disbelievers had a similar right if a believing woman joined the Muslims. This and the following verses were revealed after the Treaty of al-Hudaybiyyah."
  60,11,"If any of your wives desert you and join the disbelievers [without returning your dowries], and later you take spoils from them, then give to those whose wives have deserted them the equivalent of what they had spent. And fear Allah, in Whom you believe.",""
