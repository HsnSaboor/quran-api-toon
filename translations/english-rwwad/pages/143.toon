quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,119,"Why should you not eat of that over which the name of Allah is mentioned when He has expounded clearly what is forbidden to you, unless you are compelled by necessity<sup>38</sup>? Indeed, many [deviants] lead others astray by their desires, without any knowledge. Your Lord knows best the transgressors.","[38] Allah says: “But if someone is compelled by necessity – neither driven by desire nor exceeding immediate need – then there is no sin upon him.” See 2:173."
  6,120,"Avoid committing sin, whether openly or in secret. Indeed, those who commit sin will be recompensed for what they used to do.",""
  6,121,"Do not eat of that [meat] over which the name of Allah is not mentioned, for this is a grave disobedience. But the devils whisper to their [human] friends to argue with you; if you were to obey them<sup>39</sup>, you would surely become polytheists.","[39] As obedience being the basis of worship."
  6,122,"Is the one who was dead and We gave him life [by faith] and gave him a light with which he walks among people like the one in darkness from which he can never escape<sup>40</sup>? This is how the deeds of the disbelievers have been made appealing to them.","[40] The simile given here is about someone who is guided by light of guidance and someone who is bereft of the light of guidance."
  6,123,"Thus We have placed in every city the most wicked ones to conspire in it, yet they only conspire against themselves, without even realizing it.",""
  6,124,"When a sign comes to them, they say, “We will never believe until we are given the like of what was given to the messengers of Allah.” Allah knows best where to place His message. Those who are wicked will be afflicted with disgrace from Allah and a severe punishment for their plots.",""
