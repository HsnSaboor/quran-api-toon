quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  29,39,"And [We also destroyed] Korah, Pharaoh and Hāmān. Moses came to them with clear signs, but they showed arrogance in the land, yet they could not escape [Us].",""
  29,40,"Each of them We seized for their sin: against some of them We sent a storm of stones<sup>11</sup>; some were seized by a blast<sup>12</sup>; some We caused the earth to swallow<sup>13</sup>; and some We drowned<sup>14</sup>. It was not Allah Who wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves.","[11] e.g., the people of Prophet Lot; and the people of Prophet Hūd (Aad) who were subjected to a furious windstorm for seven nights and eight days continuously.\n [12] e.g., the people of Prophet Sālih (Thamūd).\n [13] e.g., Korah, the cousin of Prophet Moses.\n [14] e.g., the people of Prophet Noah; Pharaoh; and Hāmān."
  29,41,"The likeness of those who take protectors other than Allah is that of a spider spinning a house. Indeed, the flimsiest of houses is the house of a spider<sup>15</sup>, if only they knew.","[15] As it cannot protect the spider against rain, strong wind, and enemies."
  29,42,"Allah knows whatever they call upon besides Him. He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.",""
  29,43,"Such are the comparisons We set forth for people, but none will understand them except the people of knowledge.",""
  29,44,"Allah created the heavens and earth for a true purpose. Indeed, there is a sign in this for the believers.",""
  29,45,"Recite [O Prophet] what is revealed to you of the Book, and establish prayer, for indeed prayer restrains one from immoral acts and wickedness<sup>16</sup>. Indeed, the remembrance of Allah is of greater merit. And Allah knows all what you do.","[16] For it instills light in the heart, which prevents committing sins and guides to good deeds."
