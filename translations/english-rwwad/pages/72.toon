  3,167,"and in order to make known those who are hypocrites. They were told, “Come forward, fight in the way of Allah or at least defend.” They said, “If we had known there was fighting, we would have certainly followed you.” That day they were nearer to disbelief than to faith, saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts, but Allah is All-Knowing of what they conceal.",""
  3,168,"Those who stayed behind said about their brothers, “If they had obeyed us, they would not have been killed [at ’Uhud].” Say, “Then avert death from yourselves, if you are truthful.”",""

For all of this, they said: “Who would tell our brothers about us; that we are in Paradise being provided for so that they may not give up fighting in the way of Allah or cower in war?” Allah Almighty said: “I will tell them on your behalf”. Then He revealed: “Do not think that those who were killed in the way of Allah are dead. Nay but they are alive with their Lord being provided for”.
