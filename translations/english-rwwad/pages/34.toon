quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,216,"Fighting has been enjoined upon you, even though you dislike it. But it maybe that you dislike something which is good for you, and you like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know.",""
  2,217,"They ask you about fighting in the Sacred Months<sup>111</sup>. Say, “Fighting therein is a great sin, but preventing people from the path of Allah, disbelieving in Him, preventing from the Sacred Mosque, and expelling its people from it is a greater sin with Allah, and persecution is far worse than fighting<sup>112</sup>.” They will not cease fighting you until they turn you away from your faith if they can. And if anyone among you renounces his faith and dies as a disbeliever, their deeds will be void in this life and in the Hereafter. They are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.","[111] Sacred Months are: 1st, 7th, 11th and 12th months of the lunar calendar. [112] The disbelievers asked this to scorn the Prophet (ﷺ) for what they saw as breaking an oath when a group of believers unknowingly killed a disbeliever during a sacrosanct month. [An-Nasā’ī, As-Sunan al-Kubrā]."
  2,218,"Those who believed, migrated, and fought for the sake of Allah – it is they who hope for Allah’s mercy, and Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  2,219,"They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say, “In both, there is a great sin, and some benefits for people, but their sin is far greater than their benefit<sup>113</sup>.” They ask you what they should spend. Say, “The surplus”. This is how Allah makes His verses clear to you, so that you may contemplate –","[113] The provision of this verse concerning alcoholic drinks and gambling has been abrogated by the verse 5:90."
