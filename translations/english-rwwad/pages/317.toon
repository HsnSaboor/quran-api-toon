  20,77,"We inspired Moses, “Travel by night with My slaves, and strike for them a dry path across the sea. Have no fear of being overtaken, nor be afraid [of drowning].”",""
  20,78,"Then Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers, but they were completely overwhelmed by the sea<sup>21</sup>.","[21] i.e., not only drowning in water but other things which are only known to Allah such as terror, pain, regret, etc."
  20,79,"Thus Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide them.",""
  20,80,"O Children of Israel, We rescued you from your enemy, and made an appointment with you<sup>22</sup> on the right side of Mount Tūr [in Sinai], and sent down for you manna and quails<sup>23</sup>,","[22] i.e., with your prophet to talk to him and receive the Tablets for your guidance.\n [23] They were provided with manna (bread or honey-like food) and quails in the wilderness after they left Egypt."
  20,81,"[saying], “Eat from the good things We have provided for you, but do not exceed the limits therein, or My wrath will befall you, for anyone upon whom My wrath befalls is perished.",""
  20,82,"I am indeed Most Forgiving to those who repent and believe, and do righteous deeds, then stay on the right path.”",""
  20,83,"[Allah asked], “What made you hasten from your people, O Moses?”<sup>24</sup>","[24] Moses chose a delegation of seventy people from the Children of Israel to go to Mount Tūr to receive the Tablets. He was in haste to meet his Lord, so he rushed to the appointment and arrived before his people, leaving them behind. See (7:143-145)"
  20,84,"He said, “They are following my footsteps; I hastened to You, my Lord, to please You.”",""
  20,85,"Allah said, “We have certainly tested your people in your absence, and Sāmiri<sup>25</sup> has led them astray.”","[25] i.e., the Samaritan (a man from Samaria), a hypocrite who led the Children of Israel to the worship of the calf, or to idol-worship."
  20,86,"So Moses returned to his people, angry and sorrowful. He said, “O my people, did your Lord not promise you a good promise<sup>26</sup>? Was my absence too long for you, or did you want the wrath from your Lord to befall you, so you broke your promise to me<sup>27</sup>?”","[26] To send down the Torah for your guidance. [27] Of worshiping Allah alone until Moses comes back to them."
  20,87,"They said, “We did not break our promise to you out of our own free will, but we were made to carry loads of the people’s jewelry, so we threw them [into the fire], and so did the Sāmiri throw.”<sup>28</sup>","[28] They carried loads of jewelry of the people of the Pharaoh that they had with them, so they threw them into the fire in order to get rid of them. As for the Sāmiri, he threw the dust that he collected from the hoof-print of Gabriel’s horse."
