quran[3]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,246,"Did you not see the chiefs of the Children of Israel after Moses when they said to their prophet: “Appoint for us a king so that we fight in the way of Allah.” He said: “How likely is it that if fighting was enjoined upon you that you will not fight?” They said: “How could we not fight in the way of Allah, while we have been driven out of our homes and separated from our children<sup>137</sup>?” However, when fighting was enjoined upon them, they turned away, except a few of them. And Allah is All-Knowing of the wrongdoers.","[137] Their women and children were taken as captives by the enemy."
  2,247,"Their prophet said to them: “Allah has appointed Saul as your king.” They said: “How could he be a king over us when we are more deserving of kingship than him, and he has not been given affluence in wealth?” He said: “Allah has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and physique. Allah gives kingship to whom He wills, and Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.”",""
  2,248,"Their prophet further said to them: “The sign of his kingship is that the Ark will come to you – carried by the angels – having therein tranquility<sup>138</sup> from your Lord and remains of what the House of Moses and the House of Aaron had left. Indeed, there is a sign in this for you, if you are true believers.”","[138] i.e., was giving reassurance."
