  40,50,"They will say, “Did your messengers not come to you with clear proofs?” They will say, “Yes.” They will say, “Then keep praying! The prayer of the disbelievers is only in vain.”",""
  40,51,"We will surely help Our messengers and those who believe in the life of this world and on the Day when the witnesses will come forward,",""
  40,52,"the Day when the excuses of the wrongdoers will be of no benefit to them; and they will be cursed and for them there will be the worst abode<sup>12</sup>.","[12] i.e., the Hellfire."
  40,53,"We gave Moses guidance, and made the Children of Israel inherit the Scripture,",""
  40,54,"as a guide and a reminder to people of understanding.",""
  40,55,"So be patient, for Allah’s promise is true. Seek forgiveness for your sin<sup>13</sup>, and glorify your Lord with His praise evening and morning.","[13] Like all other prophets and messengers, Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) was infallible of sins, especially concerning what they conveyed from Allah. However, flaws or mistakes could happen with prophets, like all other human beings. The examples include the Prophet’s response to the blind man (80:1-10); Jonah’s departure from his people without Allah’s permission (21:87-88); and David’s suspicion and fear of the two men who scaled the wall of his chamber (38:21-25). If the Prophet (ﷺ) himself is urged to seek Allah’s forgiveness, then the believers are far more in need of seeking Allah’s forgiveness."
  40,56,"Those who argue against the verses of Allah without any proof given to them, there is nothing in their hearts but a quest for dominance which they will never attain. So seek refuge with Allah, for He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.",""
  40,57,"The creation of the heavens and earth is far greater than the creation of mankind, but most people do not know.",""
  40,58,"The blind and the seeing are not equal, nor are those who believe and do righteous deeds [equal] to those who do evil. Little do you take heed!",""
