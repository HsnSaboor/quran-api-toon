quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  10,15,"When Our verses are recited to them clearly, those who do not expect to meet Us say, “Bring us a different Qur’an, or make changes in it<sup>19</sup>.” Say, “It is not for me to change it on my own accord; I only follow what is revealed to me. If I were to disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a momentous Day.”","[19] They hated those parts of the Qur’an that did not conform to their erroneous way of life, such as resurrection."
  10,16,"Say, “If Allah had willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. I have spent a lifetime<sup>20</sup> among you before this. Do you not then understand?”","[20] i.e., forty years before receiving revelation."
  10,17,"Who does greater wrong than he who fabricates lies against Allah or rejects His verses? Indeed, the wicked will never succeed.",""
  10,18,"They worship besides Allah those who can neither harm nor benefit them, saying, “These are our intercessors with Allah.” Say, “Do you inform Allah of what He does not know in the heavens or on the earth? Glorified and Exalted is He far above what they associate [with Him]!”",""
  10,19,"The whole of mankind was but a single community, then they differed<sup>21</sup>. If it had not been for a prior decree from your Lord, a decisive judgment would have been passed between them concerning their differences<sup>22</sup>.","[21] Ibn ‘Abbās (رضى الله عنهما) reported: “The time between Adam and Noah was ten centuries. Throughout these, people were on the right path of Allah, but then they started disputing [over matters of Faith, i.e., idol worshiping]. So, Allah sent prophets bearing glad tiding and warning”. [Al-Hākim, Al-Mustadrak: 2:546, cf. Al-Tabarī]\n [22] i.e., not to punish anyone before evidence has come to him, or not to judge between them in this life."
  10,20,"They say, “Why has no sign<sup>23</sup> been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say [O Prophet], “The unseen belongs to Allah alone. Wait then; I too am waiting with you.”","[23] i.e., a miracle."
