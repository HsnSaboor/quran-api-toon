  7,38,"Allah will say, “Enter the Fire along with nations of jinn and humans who have passed on before you.” Every time a nation enters, it will curse the preceding one until they are all gathered inside, the followers will say about their leaders, “Our Lord, they have led us astray, so give them a double punishment of the Fire.” He will say, “Each will have a double punishment, but you do not know.”",""
  7,39,"The leaders will say to their followers, “You were no better than us, so taste the punishment for what you used to do.”",""
  7,40,"Those who reject Our verses and show arrogance towards them, the gates of heaven will not be opened for them<sup>11</sup>, nor will they enter Paradise until a camel can pass through the eye of a needle. This is how We recompense the wicked.","[11] The doors of heaven will be shut for them."
  7,41,"Hell will be their resting place and above them will be coverings [of fire]. This is how We recompense the wrongdoers.",""
  7,42,"As for those who believe and do righteous deeds – We do not burden a soul more than what it can bear – they are the people of Paradise, they will abide therein forever.",""
  7,43,"We will remove all ill feelings from their hearts<sup>12</sup> and rivers will flow beneath them. They will say, “All praise be to Allah Who has guided us to this, for We would not have been guided to this if Allah had not guided us. The messengers of our Lord came with the truth.” They will be called, “This is Paradise that you are made to inherit for what you used to do.”","[12] i.e., all ill thoughts or sense of injury they might have had during worldly life."
