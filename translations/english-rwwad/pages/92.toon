quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,87,"Allah: None has the right to be worshiped except Him. He will surely gather you all on the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt. Who is more truthful in speech than Allah?",""
  4,88,"What is the matter with you that you are divided into two groups concerning the hypocrites when Allah has reverted them [to disbelief] because of their misdeeds? Do you want to guide those whom Allah has caused to stray? Whoever Allah causes to stray, you will never find a way [to guidance] for him.",""
  4,89,"They wish that you would disbelieve just as they have disbelieved so that you become all alike. Therefore do not take from them allies unless they migrate for the sake of Allah. But if they turn away, seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take from them any allies or helpers,",""
  4,90,"except those who join a people with whom you have a treaty<sup>66</sup> or those who come to you feeling discomfort to fight you or fight their own people. If Allah had willed, He would have empowered them to fight you. Therefore if they withdraw and refrain from fighting you and offer you peace, then Allah has not given you permission [to fight] against them.","[66] Believers should honor their pledges. If a party with which believers have a peace treaty accepts those who come to them seeking refuge, then, by extension, the treaty includes them as well."
  4,91,"You will find others who wish to be secure from you and from their own people. Whenever they are tempted back to disbelief, they fall into it. Therefore if they do not withdraw, or offer you peace, or restrain their hands from you, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them; they are those against whom We have given you a clear authority.",""
