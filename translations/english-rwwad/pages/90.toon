quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,75,"Why is it that you do not fight in the way of Allah and for the sake of the oppressed men, women, and children who say, “Our Lord, take us out of this town<sup>53</sup> of oppressive people, and grant us from Yourself a protector and grant us from Yourself a helper”?","[53] i.e., Makkah."
  4,76,"The believers fight in the way of Allah, whereas the disbelievers fight in the way of Tāghoot<sup>54</sup> [i.e., false gods]. So fight the allies of Satan. Indeed, the scheme of Satan is ever weak.","[54] See footnote 4:60."
  4,77,"Have you not seen those who were told, “Restrain your hands [from fighting]<sup>55</sup>, establish prayer and give zakah”? However, when fighting was ordained for them, a group of them feared people as one should fear Allah or even more. They said, “Our Lord, why have You ordained fighting for us? If only you had spared us for a little while.” Say, “The enjoyment of this world is little, and the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah. And you will not be wronged, even as much as a thread of a date stone.","[55] Before permission was given to them by Allah."
  4,78,"Wherever you are, death will overcome you, even if you are in fortified towers.” If something good happens to them, they say, “This is from Allah,” but if something bad happens to them, they say, “This is from you<sup>56</sup>.” Say, “All is from Allah.” What is wrong with these people that they hardly understand any words?","[56] The hypocrites addressing the Prophet (ﷺ)."
  4,79,"Whatever good happens to you<sup>57</sup> is from Allah, but whatever bad happens to you is from yourself<sup>58</sup>. We have sent you [O Prophet] as a messenger to mankind, and sufficient is Allah as a witness.","[57] O children of Adam!\n [58] is due to your mistakes or sins."
