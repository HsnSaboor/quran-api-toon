This is how Allah makes His verses clear to you, so that you may be guided.","[48] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “I will leave with you after me two grave matters. The first is the Book of Allah. It is the rope of Allah; whoever follows it, is guided and whoever does not, has gone astray”.

Destitute and Allah made you well-off by me? Divided and Allah united you by me?” [Muslim: 1061]"
