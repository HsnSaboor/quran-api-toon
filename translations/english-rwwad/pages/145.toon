quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,132,"Everyone will be assigned ranks according to their deeds, for your Lord is not unaware of what they do.",""
  6,133,"Your Lord is the Self-Sufficient and full of Mercy. If He wills, He can take you away and replace you with whoever He wills, just as He brought you forth from the offspring of other people.",""
  6,134,"Indeed, what you have been promised will come to pass, and you will have no escape.",""
  6,135,"Say [O Prophet], “O my people, carry on in your way, and so will I; you will come to know who will have the [best] ultimate abode. Indeed, the wrongdoers will never succeed.”",""
  6,136,"They assign to Allah a portion of the crops and livestock He created, saying, “This is for Allah” – as they claim – “and this is for our partners [i.e., idols].” But that which is assigned for their partners does not reach Allah, while that which is assigned for Allah reaches their partners<sup>44</sup>. How unfair their judgment is!","[44] It was an Arab heathen ritual to allocate two shares out of their livestock; a share for God and a share for idols. If a portion of God’s share was mixed with that of their idols, they would not deduct it, saying that God is in no need of it. Yet if a portion of their idols’ share fell with that of God’s they would readily cut it and add it on to their idols’ share."
  6,137,"Similarly, the evil associates of the pagans have made the killing of their children<sup>45</sup> appealing to them, in order to lead them to destruction and confuse them in their faith. If Allah had willed, they would not have done that. So leave them to their fabrications.","[45] Out of fear of poverty."
