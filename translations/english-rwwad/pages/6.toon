quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,30,"And [remember] when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to appoint a vicegerent on earth.” They said, “Will You appoint on it someone who will spread corruption therein and shed blood, while we glorify You with Your praises and proclaim Your holiness?” He said, “I know that which you do not know.”",""
  2,31,"And He taught Adam the names of everything; then He presented them to the angels, and said, “Tell Me the names of these, if what you say is true?”",""
  2,32,"They said, “Glory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You Who are the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”",""
  2,33,"He said, “O Adam, inform them of their names.” When he informed them of their names, Allah said, “Did I not tell you that I know the unseen of the heavens and earth, and I know what you reveal and what you conceal?”",""
  2,34,"And when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam<sup>18</sup>,” and they prostrated except Iblīs<sup>19</sup>; he refused and was arrogant, and was one of the disbelievers.","[18] This prostration was done in obedience to Allah, out of respect, not worship.\n [19] The proper name of Satan, who was not an angel, but from the jinn."
  2,35,"We said, “O Adam, dwell in Paradise, you and your wife; and eat pleasantly from wherever you wish, but do not approach this tree, or else you will both become the wrongdoers.”",""
  2,36,"Then Satan tempted them and drove them out of the state they were in, and We said, “Go down [to the earth], as enemies to one another. You will have abode on earth and provision for an appointed time<sup>20</sup>.”","[20] Until the Day of Judgment."
  2,37,"Then Adam received some words<sup>21</sup> from his Lord, and He accepted his repentance. He is the Accepter of repentance, the Most Merciful.","[21] These words, or supplications are: “They [both] said: “Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers.” See 7:23."
