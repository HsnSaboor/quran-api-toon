quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  14,34,"And He gave you of all that you have asked for<sup>24</sup>. If you try to count the blessings of Allah, you cannot count them<sup>25</sup>. Indeed, mankind is truly unjust and ungrateful.","[24] It is not only these grand favors that Allah grants people, but their prayers are also answered, be they uttered or merely wished for.\n [25] If a person were to ever try to count Allah’s blessings on him, he would never be able to count them, let alone be duly grateful for them."
  14,35,"And [remember] when Abraham said, “My Lord, make this city [of Makkah] secure and save me and my children from worshiping idols.",""

  14,37,"Our Lord, I have settled some of my offspring in a barren valley near Your Sacred House, our Lord, so that they may establish prayer<sup>27</sup>. So make the people’s hearts incline towards them, and provide for them fruits, so that they may be grateful.","[27] Prayer is specifically mentioned here because it is the best, most comprehensive act of worship and that it is key to all good."
  14,38,"Our Lord, You know what we conceal and what we reveal. Nothing is hidden from Allah on earth or in heaven.",""
  14,39,"All praise be to Allah Who has granted me in old age Ishmael and Isaac<sup>28</sup>. Indeed, my Lord is the All-Hearing of prayers.","[28] This is a practical demonstration of Abraham’s gratitude to Allah for His blessings."
  14,40,"My Lord, make me steadfast in prayer and those of my offspring. Our Lord, accept my supplication.",""
  14,41,"Our Lord, forgive me, my parents, and the believers on the Day when the reckoning will take place.”",""
  14,42,"Never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do<sup>29</sup>; He only delays them for a Day when eyes will stare [in horror]<sup>30</sup> –","[29] It serves both as comfort to the oppressed and as a warning to the oppressors.\n [30] Because of the horrifying sights they see, they will be unblinkingly staring upwards in horror."
