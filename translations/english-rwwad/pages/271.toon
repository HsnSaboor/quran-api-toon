  16,35,"Those who associate partners with Allah say, “If Allah had willed, neither we nor our forefathers would have worshiped anything besides Him, nor would we have prohibited anything without His command<sup>22</sup>.” Those who came before them did the same. Is the duty of the messengers except to convey the message clearly?","[22] They falsely argue citing predestination (al-qadā’ wa al-qadar), while they were given the ability to choose the path to follow in this life."
  16,36,"Indeed, We sent to every community a messenger, [saying], “Worship Allah and shun false gods<sup>23</sup>.” Among them were some whom Allah guided, while others were destined to stray. So travel through the land and see how was the end of the deniers!","[23] Tāghūt: false objects of worship. See footnote 2:256."
  16,37,"Even though you are keen to guide them, Allah does not guide those whom He causes to stray<sup>24</sup>, and they will have no helpers.","[24] As a result of their choice to reject guidance."

  16,42,"those who endured patiently and put their trust in their Lord.",""
