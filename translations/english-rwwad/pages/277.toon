quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  16,88,"Those who disbelieve and prevent others from the way of Allah, We will add punishment to their punishment for the corruption they used to spread.",""
  16,89,"On the Day when We raise up against every community a witness from among themselves, We will bring you [O Prophet] as a witness against these [people]. We have sent down to you the Book as an explanation of everything, and as a guidance, mercy, and glad tidings for the Muslims.",""
  16,90,"Allah enjoins justice, kindness, and giving relatives<sup>56</sup> [their dues], and He forbids shameful acts, evil deeds and oppression. He exhorts you, so that you may take heed.","[56] Degree of kinship: Parents, then offspring, then brothers and sisters, then paternal uncles and aunts, then maternal uncles and aunts, and then other relatives."
  16,91,"Fulfill the covenant of Allah when you pledge, and do not break oaths after confirming them, having made Allah your witness, for Allah knows all what you do.",""
  16,92,"Do not be like the woman who unravels her yarn after spinning it firmly, by taking your oaths as a means of deceit between yourselves so that one party might gain an advantage over the other<sup>57</sup>. Allah only puts you to the test thereby<sup>58</sup>, and on the Day of Resurrection, He will surely make clear to you all that over which you used to differ.","[57] i.e., Do not swear falsely or break a treaty merely for worldly gain.\n [58] As to who will honor their binding pledge and who will break it for another alluring pact with a stronger party."
  16,93,"If Allah had willed, He would have made all of you a single community [of believers], but He causes to stray whom He wills and guides whom He wills<sup>59</sup>, and you will surely be questioned about what you used to do.","[59] According to His infinite knowledge of each soul’s preference."
