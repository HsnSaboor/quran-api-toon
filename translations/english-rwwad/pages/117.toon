quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,51,"O you who believe, do not take the Jews and Christians as allies; they are allies of one another. Whoever among you takes them as allies<sup>48</sup> is indeed one of them. Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.","[48] i.e., Whoever takes them as allies, aids them against the believers, or opts for their religion over Islam."
  5,52,"You see those<sup>49</sup> with sickness in their hearts rushing to them, saying, “We fear a misfortune may strike us.” Perhaps Allah will bring about victory or some other decision from Himself, then they will regret what they kept hidden in their hearts.","[49] i.e., the hypocrites."
  5,53,"And those who believe say, “Are these the people who swore their solemn oaths by Allah that they were with you<sup>50</sup>?” Their deeds have become worthless, and they have become losers.","[50] The hypocrites after their exposure."
  5,54,"O you who believe, Whoever among you renounces his faith, Allah will bring a people whom He loves and who love Him. They will be humble towards the believers but strict towards the disbelievers, striving in the way of Allah and fearing no reproach from any critic. This is Allah’s favor which He gives to whom He wills. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.",""
  5,55,"Your only allies are Allah, His Messenger, and those believers who establish prayer and give zakah with humble submission.",""
  5,56,"Whoever takes Allah, His Messenger, and the believers as their allies, then it is the party of Allah that will certainly prevail.",""
  5,57,"O you who believe, do not take as allies those who were given the Scripture before you and the disbelievers who ridicule your religion and make fun of it. And fear Allah, if you are believers.",""
