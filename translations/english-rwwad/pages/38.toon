quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,234,"Those among you who pass away and leave behind widows should refrain from remarrying for four months and ten days. When they have completed their waiting period, there is no sin on you concerning what they do for themselves<sup>127</sup> in a reasonable manner<sup>128</sup>. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.","[127] They may remarry if they wish.\n [128] A social norm that entails keeping within the dictates of Islam."
  2,235,"There is no sin on you if you hint a proposal of marriage or keep it concealed in your hearts. Allah knows that you will make mention of them<sup>129</sup>, but do not make a secret promise with them, except that you may say something appropriate<sup>130</sup>. Do not resolve a marriage contract until the prescribed time is reached. And know that Allah knows what is in your hearts, so be cautious of Him and know that Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.","[129] i.e., the widowed or irrevocably divorced.\n [130] e.g. by saying to her, ""If one finds a wife like you, he will be happy"" or so."
  2,236,"There is no sin on you if you divorce women before you have consummated the marriage or the dowry has been fixed; but give them a [gift of] compensation – the wealthy according to his means and the poor according to his means – a reasonable compensation is an obligation upon those who do good.",""
  2,237,"If you divorce them before you have consummated the marriage, but you have already fixed their dowry, then pay half the amount agreed upon, unless the wife graciously waives it or the husband graciously pays it in full, but graciousness is closer to piety. Do not forget to be graceful to one another, for Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.",""
