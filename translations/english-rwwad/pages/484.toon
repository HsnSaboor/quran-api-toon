quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  42,11,"the Originator of the heavens and earth. He has given you spouses of your own kind, and pairs of livestock; by which He causes you to multiply. There is nothing like unto Him<sup>8</sup>, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.","[8] In His essence, His attributes, or His deeds."
  42,12,"To Him belong the keys of the heavens and earth; He extends provision to whom He wills or restricts it. Indeed, He is All-Knowing of all things.",""
  42,13,"He has prescribed for you [believers] the same religion which He enjoined upon Noah, and that which We have revealed to you [O Prophet] and that which We enjoined upon Abraham, Moses, and Jesus<sup>9</sup>: “You should uphold the religion and make no divisions therein.” What you are calling the polytheists to is very hard for them. Allah chooses for Himself whom He wills and guides to Himself who turns to Him.","[9] This verse is naming the five greatest prophets of Allah (the prophets of the firm resolve): Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad. See also 33:7."
  42,14,"They did not become divided except after the knowledge had come to them<sup>10</sup>, out of envious rivalry between them. Were it not for a prior decree from your Lord until an appointed term<sup>11</sup>, a decisive judgment would already have been passed between them. Indeed, those who inherited the Scripture<sup>12</sup> after them are in disquieting doubt about it.","[10] No community split into factions except after receiving the knowledge given to them by their prophet, out of transgression and obstinacy towards the truth.\n [11] That He will delay their punishment to the judgment Day.\n [12] i.e., the Jews and the Christians."
  42,15,"Therefore call to that [religion, O Prophet] and keep to the straight path as you are commanded, and do not follow their desires, and say, “I believe in every Scripture that Allah has sent down, and I have been commanded to judge fairly among you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. We have our deeds and you have your deeds<sup>13</sup>. Let there be no [further] argument between us and you<sup>14</sup>; Allah will bring us together, and to Him is the final return.”","[13] i.e., the consequences thereof.\n [14] Since the truth and falsehood have become clear, but those who refuse the truth do so only out of obstinacy or pursuing worldly interests."
