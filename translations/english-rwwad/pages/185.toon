quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  8,62,"But if they intend to deceive you, then Allah is sufficient for you; it is He Who supported you with His help and with that of the believers.",""
  8,63,"He brought their hearts together<sup>39</sup>, even if you had spent all that is on earth, you could not have brought their hearts together, but Allah has brought them together, for He is All-Mighty, All-Wise.","[39] The joining of the hearts was indeed a great favour, as the extent of enmity among them in the pre-Islamic era was rampant."
  8,64,"O Prophet, Allah is sufficient for you<sup>40</sup> and for the believers who follow you.","[40] See 3:173."
  8,65,"O Prophet, urge the believers to fight. If there are twenty steadfast among you, they will overcome two hundred; and if there are a hundred of you, they will overcome a thousand of the disbelievers, for they are a people who do not understand.",""
  8,66,"Now Allah has lightened your burden, for He knew that there is weakness in you. So if there are a hundred steadfast men among you, they will overcome two hundred; and if there are a thousand, they will overcome two thousand, by Allah’s permission. And Allah is with those who are steadfast.",""
  8,67,"It is not befitting for a prophet to take captives<sup>41</sup> until he thoroughly subdues [the enemy] in the land. You desire the gains of this world<sup>42</sup>, but Allah desires [for you] the Hereafter. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.","[41] It is referring to the disbelievers of Quraysh who were taken as captives by the Prophet (ﷺ) in the wake of Badr.\n [42] i.e., material benefits, such as the ransom paid by prisoners."
  8,68,"Were it not for a prior decree<sup>43</sup> from Allah, you would have surely been afflicted with a great punishment for what you have taken [of ransom].","[43] This ‘decree’: 1) that He would make spoils and ransom lawful, 2) that He would not punish for a matter not explained previously, 3) and that He would not punish the Companions who attended Badr."
  8,69,"So consume what you have gained in war, for it is lawful<sup>44</sup> and good, but fear Allah. Allah is indeed All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","[44] When Allah saw the destitution and helplessness of the Muslims, He made gains of war lawful for them."
