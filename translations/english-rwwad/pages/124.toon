  5,101,"O you who believe, do not ask about things which, if they are made known to you, would only cause you hardship<sup>67</sup>. If you inquire about them while the Qur’an is being revealed, they will be made known to you. Allah has pardoned you for it. Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.","[67] i.e., especially contrived questions, if responded to will widen the circle of divine ordinances, which might cause difficulty for the believers to act on them."

  5,103,"Allah did not ordain any such thing as the Bahīrah, Sā’ibah, Wasīlah, and Hām [i.e., dedicated camels to idols]<sup>69</sup>. Rather those who disbelieve fabricate lies against Allah, and most of them do not understand.","[69] Camels dedicated to idols and set free to pasture, liberated from the service of man. Bahīrah: a she-camel whose riding and milking were forbidden. Sā’ibah: a she-camel that was let loose for free pasture for their idols and nothing was allowed to be carried on it. Waṣīlah: a she-camel set free for idols for it has given birth to a she-camel at its first and second delivery. Hām: a stallion-camel freed from work for the sake of their idols, after breeding ten live births."
