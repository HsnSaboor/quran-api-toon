quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,164,"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and earth; the alternation of the night and day; the sailing of the ships in the sea for the benefit of people; the sending down of rain from the sky by Allah, reviving thereby the earth after its death; the spreading of all kinds of creatures therein; the directing of the winds and clouds between the sky and earth – in all these, there are signs<sup>71</sup> for people of understanding.","[71] There are two āyāt (signs) leading to belief: Quranic verses and cosmic signs. The signs meant in this verse are cosmic."
  2,165,"And among people, there are some who take others as equals to Allah<sup>72</sup>: they love them as they should love Allah. But those who believe are stronger in their love for Allah. If only the wrongdoers could see the punishment, they would surely realize that all power belongs to Allah and that Allah is severe in punishment.","[72] In spite of all these clear signs, some people still worship false deities besides Allah."
  2,166,"[Consider] when those who were followed, they will disown their followers when they see the punishment, and all ties between them will be cut off.",""
  2,167,"The followers will say, “If only we could have another chance, so we could disown them as they have disowned us.” Thus will Allah show them their deeds as sources of regret, and they will never get out of the Fire.",""
  2,168,"O people, eat from what is lawful and good<sup>73</sup> on earth, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan, for he is your sworn enemy.","[73] Two conditions for consuming food: lawful, and beneficial; not harmful."
  2,169,"He only orders you to commit evil and immoral deeds, and to say concerning Allah what you do not know<sup>74</sup>.","[74] Falsely claiming that Allah made one thing lawful and another unlawful."
