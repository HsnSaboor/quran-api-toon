quran[3]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,231,"When you divorce women and they have completed their waiting period, either retain them with fairness or release them with fairness. Do not retain them in order to harm them<sup>124</sup>, exceeding the limits. Whoever does this, he has wronged himself. Do not make mockery of Allah’s verses, and remember Allah’s grace upon you and what He has sent down to you of the Book and the Wisdom, to exhort you. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is All-Knowing of everything.","[124] By prolonging an agonizing waiting period, holding them back from marrying other husbands or forcing them into seeking separation."
  2,232,"When you divorce women, and they have reached the end of their waiting period, do not prevent them from marrying their husbands<sup>125</sup> if they mutually agree with fairness. This advice is for all among you who believe in Allah and the Last Day. This is better and purer for you. And Allah knows, and you do not know.","[125] For the first or second time."
  2,233,"Mothers<sup>126</sup> may breastfeed their children for two full years, for those who wish to complete the full term of breastfeeding. It is the obligation upon the father of the child that he provides food and clothing [for the mothers] with fairness. No soul is obligated beyond what it can bear. Neither mother nor father should be made to suffer on account of their child, and the same duty is incumbent on the heir. If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent and consultation, there is no sin on them. And If you wish to provide a wet nurse to your children, there is no sin on you, if you pay in full what you have agreed upon with fairness. But fear Allah and know that Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.","[126] ‘Mothers’ here means divorced mothers."
