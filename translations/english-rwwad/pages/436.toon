quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  35,12,"The two bodies of water are not alike: one is fresh and palatable, pleasant to drink, and the other is salty and bitter. Yet from each you eat fresh meat and extract ornaments to wear. And you see the ships traverse their way through both, so that you may seek His bounty and so that you may give thanks.",""
  35,13,"He merges the night into the day and the day into the night, and subjected the sun and the moon, each running its course for an appointed term. Such is Allah, your Lord. To Him belongs the dominion, whereas those whom you invoke besides Him do not own so much as the membrane of a date stone.",""
  35,14,"If you call upon them, they cannot hear your call, and even if they were to hear, they could not respond to you. On the Day of Resurrection they will disown your associating them as partners with Allah<sup>5</sup>. And none can inform you like the All-Aware.","[5] Or your worship of them."
  35,15,"O people, it is you who are in need of Allah, whereas Allah is the Self-Sufficient, the Praiseworthy.",""
  35,16,"If He wills, He can eliminate you and bring in a new creation,",""
  35,17,"for that is not difficult for Allah.",""
  35,18,"No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another. If a heavily-laden soul calls for help to bear its burden, nothing of it will be carried, even if he is a close relative. You can only warn those who fear their Lord unseen<sup>6</sup> and establish prayer. Whoever purifies himself, he only does so for his own benefit. To Allah is the final return.","[6] Without seeing Him or when they are in private."
