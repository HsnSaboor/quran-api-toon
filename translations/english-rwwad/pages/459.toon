quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  39,6,"He created you from a single soul<sup>3</sup>, then He made from it its mate<sup>4</sup>, and He created for you eight types of livestock<sup>5</sup>. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers [in stages], creation after creation, in three layers of darkness<sup>6</sup>. Such is Allah, your Lord. To Him belongs the dominion; none has the right to be worshiped except Him. So how are you averted?","[3] i.e., Adam. [4] i.e., Eve. [5] The eight types of livestock: (four males and females): a pair of sheep, a pair of goats, a pair of camels, and a pair of oxen. See 6:143-144.\n [6] These three layers: the belly, the womb, and the amniotic membrane."
  39,7,"If you disbelieve, then Allah is in no need of you, but He does not approve of disbelief for His slaves. If you are grateful, He approves that for you. No bearer of burden can bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you of what you used to do. He is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts.",""
  39,8,"When adversity befalls man, he calls upon his Lord, turning to Him in repentance. Then when his Lord bestows His favor upon him, he forgets the adversity for which he was calling upon Him before, and sets up rivals to Allah, to mislead others from His way. Say [O Prophet], “Enjoy your disbelief for a little while; you will be one of the people of the Fire.”",""
  39,9,"[Is he better] or the one who constantly worships during the night, prostrating and standing, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord? Say, “Are those who know equal to those who do not know?” It is only the people of understanding who will take heed.",""
  39,10,"Say<sup>7</sup>, “O My slaves who believe, fear your Lord. Those who do good in this world will have a good return, and Allah’s earth is spacious. Those who observe patience will be given their reward without measure.”","[7] Allah instructed the Prophet (ﷺ) to say on behalf of Him."
