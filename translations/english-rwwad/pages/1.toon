  1,1,"All praise be to Allah<sup>1</sup>, the Lord<sup>2</sup> of the worlds<sup>3</sup>,","[1] Allah is God’s most unique name.\n [2] The Arabic term ""rabb"" (translated as ""Lord"") includes all of the following meanings: ""owner, master, ruler, controller, sustainer, provider, guardian and caretaker.""\n [3] ""the worlds"" means mankind, jinn, and all that exists."
  1,2,"the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful<sup>4</sup>,","[4] Ar-Rahmān and Ar-Raheem are two names of Allah: Rahmān is used only to describe Allah, while raheem might be used to describe a human as well. Rahmān carries a wider meaning - merciful to all creation. Justice is a part of this mercy. Raheem includes the concept of specialty - especially merciful to the believers. Forgiveness is a part of this mercy. In addition, Rahmān is adjectival, referring to an attribute of Allah and is part of His essence. Raheem is verbal, indicating what He does: i.e., bestowing and implementing mercy."
