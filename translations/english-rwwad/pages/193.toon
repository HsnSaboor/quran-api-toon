quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,37,"The postponement of [Sacred Months] is an act of disbelief<sup>35</sup>, which leads them further astray. They declare a month lawful in one year and sacred the next year, in order to match the number of months that Allah has declared as sacred, thus making lawful what Allah has made forbidden<sup>36</sup>; their evil deeds have been made appealing to them, and Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.","[35] Fighting during a sacred month.\n [36] If they found it advantageous to violate a sacred month, they would do so, designating another month sacrosanct instead to observe the restrictions of fighting."
  9,38,"O you who believe, what is the matter with you that when you are asked to march forth in the cause of Allah, you cling heavily to the earth<sup>37</sup>? Are you content with the life of this world instead of the Hereafter? But the enjoyment of the life of this world is insignificant compared to that of the Hereafter.","[37] i.e., inclining toward the comforts of the worldly life."
  9,39,"Unless you march forth, He will chastise you with a painful punishment and replace you with other people, and you cannot harm Him in the least, for Allah is Most Capable of all things.",""
  9,40,"If you do not support the Prophet, Allah has already supported him when the disbelievers forced him out; when he was second of the two<sup>38</sup> in the cave – saying to his companion, “Do not grieve; Allah is with us.” Thereupon Allah sent down His tranquility upon him, supported him with soldiers that you did not see<sup>39</sup>, and rendered the word of the disbelievers<sup>40</sup> the lowest, whereas the Word of Allah<sup>41</sup> is supreme. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.","[38] The second was his companion, Abu Bakr.\n [39] Angels came to the Prophet’s aid in the small cave.\n [40] i.e., their claims and slogans of disbelief.\n [41] i.e., ""La ilaha illa Allah"" (There is no true deity except Allah)."
