  11,13,"Or do they say, “He has fabricated it”? Say, “Then produce ten fabricated Chapters like it and seek help from whoever you can besides Allah, if you are truthful!”",""
  11,14,"But if they do not respond to you<sup>8</sup>, then know that it has been revealed with the knowledge of Allah and that none has the right to be worshiped except Him. Will you then submit to Him [as Muslims]?","[8] By accepting the challenge."
  11,15,"Those who seek the life of this world and its splendor, We will repay them in full in this life for their deeds, and nothing will be diminished from them therein.",""
  11,16,"It is they who will have nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire. All their efforts will be worthless, and all their deeds will be futile.",""
  11,17,"Can they be like those who are upon clear proof from their Lord, backed by a witness [i.e., Gabriel] from Him, and before it was the Book of Moses a guide and mercy? Such people believe in it. But whoever of the factions<sup>9</sup> disbelieves in it, the Fire will be their promised end. So have no doubt about it, for it is the truth from your Lord, but most people do not believe.","[9] i.e., Jews, Christians and all other non-Muslim nations."
  11,18,"Who does greater wrong than he who fabricates lies against Allah<sup>10</sup>? Such people will be presented before their Lord<sup>11</sup>, and the witnesses<sup>12</sup> will say, “These are the ones who lied against their Lord.” Indeed, Allah’s curse is upon the wrongdoers,","[10] That Allah has a child or associate, or ascribed the Qur’an to the Prophet (ﷺ), or claiming prophethood for themselves.\n [11] On the Day of Judgment.\n [12] i.e., the Prophets, the angels and the believers."
  11,19,"those who hinder [people] from the way of Allah, seeking to make it crooked, and they disbelieve in the Hereafter.”",""
