  9,42,"If it had been an easy win within reach and a short journey, those [hypocrites] would have followed you, but the distance seemed too far for them. They will swear by Allah<sup>43</sup>, “If we had been able, we would have surely joined you,” destroying themselves [through false oaths], and Allah knows that they are liars.","[43] When you return from the Tabūk expedition in which the hypocrites did not participate."
  9,43,"May Allah pardon you [O Prophet]! Why did you give them permission [to stay behind] before it became clear to you as to who were telling the truth, and who were liars<sup>44</sup>?","[44] None should have been given permission, so as to see who would set out with the Muslim army, the truthful; and who would not, the liars."

  9,47,"If they had gone forth with you, they would have only increased you in disorder and would have scurried around, sowing discord among you, and some of you would have listened to them. And Allah is All-Knowing of the wrongdoers.",""
