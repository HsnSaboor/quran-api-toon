quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,118,"[And Allah also turned in mercy to] the three who stayed behind<sup>86</sup>, until the earth became constrained to them, despite its vastness, and their souls became a burden to them, and they realized that there was no refuge from Allah except in Him. Then He turned to them in mercy, so that they might repent, for Allah is the Accepter of Repentance, the Most Merciful.","[86] Or whose cases were deferred. They were: Ka‘b ibn Mālik, Hilāl ibn ’Umayyah and Murārah ibn al-Rabī‘, who were sincere Companions but failed to join the Messenger’s (ﷺ) campaign in Tabūk Expedition. When he came back, unlike the hypocrites, they told the truth that they had no excuse. So, the Messenger (ﷺ) imposed a ban on them and forbade people to talk to them. This lasted for fifty nights until this verse was revealed. During this time, they endured huge mental anguish for being ostracized by the whole society. [For further details see: Al-Bukhārī: 4418, and Muslim: 2769]"
  9,119,"O you who believe, fear Allah and be with those who are truthful<sup>87</sup>.","[87] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “...A man speaks the truth and heeds it until he is recorded with Allah as an affirmer of the truth (siddīq)...” [Al-Bukhārī: 6094, Muslim: 2607]"
  9,120,"It was not for the people of Madinah and the Bedouins around them to stay behind the Messenger of Allah<sup>88</sup> or to prefer their own lives to his. That is because whenever they suffer any thirst, weariness or hunger in the cause of Allah, or tread a place which enrages the disbelievers, or inflict any loss upon an enemy, a righteous deed is recorded for them. Allah does not let the reward of those who do good to go to waste.","[88] In times of hardship, they should have endured sufferings along with the Prophet (ﷺ) instead of staying behind."
  9,121,"Nor do they spend anything [for Allah’s cause], small or large, or cross a valley, but it is recorded for them, so that Allah may give them the best reward for what they used to do.",""
  9,122,"It is not right for the believers to march forth all at once; a group should go forth to acquire deeper knowledge of the religion, in order to admonish their people when they return to them, so that they may be cautious.",""
