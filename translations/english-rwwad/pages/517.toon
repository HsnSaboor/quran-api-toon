quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  49,12,"O you who believe, avoid much suspicion, for some suspicions are sin. Do not spy on one another, nor backbite one another. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother<sup>6</sup>? You would surely abhor it. So fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Accepting of Repentance, Most Merciful.","[6] Backbiting people is likened to eating their dead bodies, for the dead do not feel the pain if their flesh is eaten; likewise, the one who is absent does not feel the pain of backbiting. So, backbiting someone is like eating his flesh while he is dead."
  49,13,"O people, We have created you from a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes so that you may recognize one another. Indeed, the most noble of you before Allah is the most righteous<sup>7</sup> among you. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.","[7] Lit., ""the one who has the most taqwā among you,"" i.e., consciousness, piety, and fear of Allah."
  49,14,"The Bedouins say, “We have believed.” Say, “You have not believed, but say, ‘We have submitted,’ for faith has not yet entered your hearts<sup>8</sup>. But if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not detract anything from the reward of your deeds. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”","[8] There is a distinction between Islam and Imān (faith). Imān is a higher degree than Islam. This distinction is mentioned in an authentic Hadīth of the Prophet (ﷺ), known as the Hadīth of Gabriel."
  49,15,"Indeed, the believers are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, then they do not have doubt, but fight with their wealth and their lives in the way of Allah. It is they who are the truthful.",""
  49,16,"Say, “Do you inform Allah of your faith, when Allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth? And Allah is All-Knowing of everything.”",""
  49,17,"They think that they have done you a favor by embracing Islam. Say, “Do not consider your Islam as a favor to me. Rather, it is Allah Who has done you a favor by guiding you to faith, if you are truthful.",""
  49,18,"Indeed, Allah knows all that is unseen of the heavens and earth, and Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.”",""
