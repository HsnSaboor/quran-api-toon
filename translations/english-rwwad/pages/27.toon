quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,177,"It is not righteousness to turn your faces towards the east or the west, but righteousness is to believe in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Scriptures, and the prophets; and to give charity out of one’s cherished wealth to relatives, orphans, the needy, the wayfarer, beggars, and to free slaves; to establish prayer and give zakah; to fulfill the ratified pledges; to be patient at times of hardship, adversity, and during the battle. Such are the true believers, and such are the righteous.",""
  2,178,"O you who believe, legal retribution is prescribed for you in cases of murder – a free for a free, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. But if one is pardoned by the victim’s guardian, then a fair ransom of blood money should be set and paid in the best way. This is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. But whoever transgresses the limits afterward, will have a painful punishment.",""
  2,179,"In the legal retribution, there is [saving of] life for you, O people of understanding, so that you may become righteous.",""
  2,180,"It is prescribed for you that when death approaches one of you – if he leaves behind any wealth – a bequest should be made in favor of parents and immediate family members<sup>78</sup> with fairness, this is a duty upon the righteous.","[78] This ruling was abrogated in Surah an-Nisā’, stipulating obligatory shares for parents and close relatives. Those who do not inherit by law may be remembered in a bequest."
  2,181,"If someone alters the bequest<sup>79</sup> after hearing it, they will bear the sin of the alteration, for Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.","[79] i.e., the will of the deceased."
