quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,156,"Ordain for us good in this life and in the Hereafter, for We have turned to You in repentance.” Allah said, “As for my punishment, I will afflict with it whom I will<sup>56</sup>, but My mercy encompasses everything; I will ordain it for those who fear Me, and give zakah, and those who believe in Our verses<sup>57</sup>,","[56] Among those who deserve punishment.\n [57] Three conditions are necessary for earning Allah’s Mercy: 1. Being Mindful of Him. 2. Giving out zakah. 3. Believing in Allah’s verses and signs."
  7,157,"those who follow the Messenger – the unlettered Prophet – whose description they find in their Torah and the Gospel. He enjoins them to do what is good and forbids them from what is evil; he makes lawful for them what is pure and makes unlawful for them what is impure; he relieves them of their burden<sup>58</sup> and the shackles<sup>59</sup> that were on them. So those who believe in him, they honor and support him, and follow the light which is sent down with him – it is they who will be successful.”","[58] i.e., difficulties in religious duties.\n [59] i.e., extreme measures previously required for repentance and retribution without recourse to compensation."
  7,158,"Say [O Prophet], “O people, I am the Messenger of Allah to you all<sup>60</sup>. To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth; none has the right to be worshiped except Him; He gives life and causes death.” So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, who believes in Allah and His words, and follow him, so that you may be guided.","[60] This call is to all people since the time of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), including the People of the Book and others."
  7,159,"Among the people of Moses there is a community which guides others with truth<sup>61</sup> and establishes justice therewith.","[61] Those who followed the final prophet, Muhammad (ﷺ)."
