quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,52,"We have brought them a Book which We have explained in detail on the basis of knowledge, as guidance and mercy for people who believe.",""
  7,53,"Are they waiting except for the fulfillment [of its warning]<sup>18</sup>? On the Day when it is fulfilled, those who ignored it before will say, “The messengers of our Lord surely came with the truth. Are there any intercessors who can intercede on our behalf? Or can we be sent back so that we may do other than what we used to do?” In fact, they will have ruined themselves and all that they used to fabricate will be lost from them.","[18] i.e., the coming of resurrection and punishment."
  7,54,"Your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and earth in six days and then rose over [i.e., istawa] the Throne<sup>19</sup>. He makes the night and day overlap in rapid succession. He made the sun, the moon, and the stars – all subservient to His command. Behold, His is the creation and the command. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of the worlds.","[19] The verb ‘istawa’ literally means rose and ascended in a manner befitting His Majesty, unlike any of His creation."
  7,55,"Call upon your Lord humbly and privately, for He does not like the transgressors.",""
  7,56,"Do not spread corruption on earth after it has been set aright, but call upon Him with fear and hope<sup>20</sup>. Indeed, the mercy of Allah is close to those who do good.","[20] i.e., not to be too sure of oneself while supplicating, gloating over good deeds, or despairing of His Mercy."
  7,57,"It is He Who sends the winds as glad tidings ahead of His Mercy, until when they bear heavy clouds, We drive them to a lifeless land then We send down rain from it, producing thereby every kind of fruit. This is how We raise the dead, so that you may take heed.",""
