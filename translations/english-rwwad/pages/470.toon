  40,26,"Pharaoh said, “Let me kill Moses, and let him call upon his Lord! For I fear that he may change your religion or spread corruption<sup>5</sup> in the land.”","[5] i.e., dissension, civil strife, and killing."
  40,27,"Moses said, “I seek refuge with my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant person who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning.”",""
  40,28,"A believing man from the house of Pharaoh, who was concealing his faith, said, “Would you kill a man<sup>6</sup> simply because he says: ‘My Lord is Allah,’ even though he has come to you with clear proofs from your Lord? If he is a liar, he will suffer the consequences of his lie, but if he is truthful, some of what he is threatening you with will befall you. Surely Allah does not guide anyone who is a transgressor and an utter liar.","[6] i.e., Moses."
  40,29,"O my people, the authority is yours today, being dominant in the land. But who would help us against Allah’s punishment, if it came upon us?” Pharaoh said, “I am only telling you what I think is right, and I am only guiding you to the right way.”",""
