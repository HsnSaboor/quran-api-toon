  4,155,"[They were cursed] for breaking their covenant, rejecting the signs of Allah, killing the prophets unjustly, and for their saying, “Our hearts are wrapped up”. Rather, it is Allah Who has sealed them for their disbelief; so none of them will believe except a few –",""
  4,156,"and for their disbelief and for their monstrous allegation<sup>105</sup> against Mary,","[105] i.e., fornication."
  4,157,"and for their saying, “We killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.” But they did not kill him nor did they crucify him, but it was made to appear to them so. Even those who dispute it are in doubt about it; they have no certain knowledge other than conjecture. But they certainly did not kill him.",""
