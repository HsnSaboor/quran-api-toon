quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  28,44,"You were not [O Prophet] on the western side [of the mountain] when We gave Moses Our commandment, nor did you witness that event<sup>18</sup>.","[18] The pagans of Makkah are recurrently reminded in the Quran that the Prophet (ﷺ) did not witness any of these events that happened centuries before his birth. See 12:102, 3:44, 11:49. So the only logical way of knowing about these stories is the divine revelation."
  28,45,"But We brought forth many generations [after Moses], and a long time passed on them<sup>19</sup>. And you [O Prophet] did not dwell among the people of Midian, rehearsing with them Our verses<sup>20</sup>, but it is We Who sent you as a messenger [and revealed to you their stories].","[19] So they forgot and neglected the ordinances of Allah over time.\n [20] The Prophet (ﷺ) had no way of knowing these stories except through the revelation from Allah."
  28,46,"You were not at the side of Mount Tūr when We called out [to Moses]. But [you have been sent] as a mercy from your Lord, to warn a people to whom no warner had come before you, so that they may take heed.",""
  28,47,"So they would not say – if struck by a calamity because of what their hands have sent forth, “Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, so we could follow Your verses and be among the believers?”",""
  28,48,"But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “If only he was given the like of what was given to Moses before<sup>21</sup>.” Did they not reject what was given to Moses before? They say, “Both [revelations] are works of magic, supporting each other”, adding, “We truly reject both of them<sup>22</sup>.”","[21] The pagans of Makkah demanded that the Qur’an should have been revealed all at once like the Torah, and the Prophet (ﷺ) should have brought us tangible miracles like Moses’ staff, illuminating hand, etc.\n [22] It refers to the pagans of Makkah concerning the Qur’an and the Torah."
  28,49,"Say, “Then bring a scripture from Allah which is better in guidance than these two so that I may follow it, if you are truthful.”",""
  28,50,"But if they do not respond to you, then know that they only follow their desires. Who is more astray than one who follows his desire without any guidance from Allah? Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.",""
