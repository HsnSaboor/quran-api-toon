quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,179,"We have surely created for Hell many jinn and humans. They have hearts with which they do not understand, eyes with which they do not see, and ears with which they do not hear<sup>77</sup>. They are like cattle<sup>78</sup>, rather, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless.","[77] As they willfully fail to use their faculties of discernment and understanding.\n [78] They only care to satiate their animalistic drives, not about the life to come, so they are no better than livestock."
  7,180,"Allah has the Most Beautiful Names, so call upon Him by them, and leave those who deviate concerning His Names<sup>79</sup>. They will be recompensed for what they used to do.","[79] i.e., use them improperly such as calling other gods besides Allah by them, or deny them, or distort their meanings."
  7,181,"And among those whom We created is a group<sup>80</sup> that guides others with the truth and establishes justice therewith.","[80] The followers of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)."
  7,182,"As for those who reject Our signs, We will gradually lead them to destruction<sup>81</sup> without them realizing it.","[81] By giving them one favor after another which only increases them in arrogance and sin."
  7,183,"I will give them respite, but My plan is firm.",""
  7,184,"Have they not reflected that their fellow [Prophet] is not insane? He is none but a clear warner.",""
  7,185,"Have they not observed the dominions of the heavens and earth and all that Allah has created, and that the end of their term might be near? In what message after this [Qur’an] will they then believe?",""
  7,186,"Whoever Allah causes to stray, there is none to guide him; He will leave them to wander blindly in their transgression.",""
  7,187,"They ask you [O Prophet] about the Hour, “When will it come to pass?” Say, “Its knowledge is only with my Lord. None can reveal its due time except Him. It will be heavy on the heavens and earth; it will only come to you by surprise.” They ask you as if you are well-aware of it. Say, “Its knowledge is only with Allah, but most people do not know.”",""
