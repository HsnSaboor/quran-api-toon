  22,65,"Do you not see that Allah has subjected to you all that is on the earth and the ships that sail through the sea by His command? He holds the sky from falling down on the earth except by His permission. Indeed, Allah is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to people.",""

  22,67,"For every community We ordained ways<sup>35</sup> of worship which they follow, so do not let them dispute with you [O Prophet] in this matter. But call them to your Lord, for you are indeed on the straight guidance.","[35] All prophets came with the same message of worshiping only One God, doing good and shunning evil; nonetheless, each faith-community had their own law."

Allah has promised it to those who disbelieve; what a terrible destination!","[37] i.e., worse than the rage you feel against the believers who recite Allah's verses or your threats against them."
