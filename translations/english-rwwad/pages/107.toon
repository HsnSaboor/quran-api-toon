quran[3]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,3,"Forbidden<sup>5</sup> to you are carrion, blood<sup>6</sup>, the flesh of swine, and that which is sacrificed to other than Allah; and that which is killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being gored; and that which is partly eaten by a predator unless you slaughter it [before it dies]; and that which is sacrificed to idols. Also it is forbidden to use arrows [of chance]<sup>7</sup> to determine your decisions. This is all evil practice. Today the disbelievers have lost all hope in [eliminating] your religion, so do not fear them but fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen Islam as your religion. But if anyone is compelled by severe hunger, not intending to sin, then Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","[5] See 2:173, 5:90.\n [6] What is unlawful is running blood, not the blood captured in vessels after slaughter.\n [7] Al-istiqsām bi al-azlām (lit. divining by casting lots): This was an Arab practice before Islam, whereby they had three lots (flat marked pieces of wood) dedicated to divinations. On each there was written either: “My Lord commanded me”, “My Lord forbade me”, or nothing at all. A person would abide by what the lot told him, but if he drew the empty one, he would recast again until he drew either one of the other two. [cf. al-Tabarī, Ibn Kathīr, al-Sa‘dī]"
  5,4,"They ask you [O Prophet] what is lawful to them. Say, “All good things<sup>8</sup> are lawful for you, and that which is caught by your trained hunting animals and birds of prey<sup>9</sup>, training them as Allah has taught you. Eat what they catch for you, but mention the name of Allah upon it.” And fear Allah, for Allah is swift in reckoning.","[8] All useful and enjoyable food that causes no harm to the body or the intellect.\n [9] Such as dogs, falcons, etc."
  5,5,"Today all good things have been made lawful to you. As the food of the people of the Book is lawful to you, and your food is lawful to them. And [it is lawful to marry] chaste believing women and chaste women from among those who were given the Book before you, provided that you give them their dowries<sup>10</sup> in honest wedlock, neither openly fornicating nor taking them as secret lovers. Whoever rejects the faith, all his efforts will be worthless and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.","[10] i.e., the bridal gift (mahr)."
