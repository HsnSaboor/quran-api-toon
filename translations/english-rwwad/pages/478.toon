quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  41,12,"He then formed them into seven heavens in two Days<sup>5</sup> and assigned to each heaven its mandate. And We adorned the lowest heaven with lamps [i.e., stars] which also serve as protection<sup>6</sup>. That is the design of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.”","[5] i.e., on Thursday and Friday. So the total period of creating the whole universe was six heavenly Days.\n [6] i.e., protection from the devils who try to steal information from the angels in heaven."
  41,13,"But if they turn away, then say, “I warn you of a blast like the one that befell ‘Ād and Thamūd,",""
  41,14,"when the messengers came to them from the front and from behind [saying], “Worship none but Allah,” they said, “If our Lord had willed <sup>7</sup>, He would have sent down angels; so we disbelieve in what you have been sent with.”","[7] To send us messengers."
  41,15,"As for ‘Ād, they were arrogant in the land without right, and said, “Who is more powerful than us?” Did they not see that Allah, Who created them, is more powerful than them? Yet they continued to reject Our signs.",""
  41,16,"So We sent against them a roaring wind<sup>8</sup> for several inauspicious days to make them taste a disgracing punishment in the life of this world, but the punishment of the Hereafter is far more disgracing, and they will not be helped.","[8] i.e., a screaming and furious wind."
  41,17,"As for Thamūd, We showed them guidance, but they preferred blindness over guidance. So they were seized by the blast of a debasing punishment for what they used to commit.",""
  41,18,"And We saved those who believed and feared Allah.",""
  41,19,"And [consider] the Day when Allah’s enemies will be gathered to the Fire, driven in rows.",""
  41,20,"until when they reach it, their hearing, their sight and their skins will testify<sup>9</sup> against them concerning what they used to do.","[9] On the Day of Judgment, the wicked will deny the evil deeds in their record of deeds - in an attempt to escape the punishment. They will be asked if they accept Allah, the angels, or even their own families and neighbors as witnesses, but they will refuse. So Allah will make their organs testify against them. [Ibn Kathīr]"
