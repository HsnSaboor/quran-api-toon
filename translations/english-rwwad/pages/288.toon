  17,59,"Nothing prevents Us from sending signs except that the earlier people denied them<sup>53</sup>. We gave Thamūd the she-camel as a clear sign, but they wrongfully rejected her<sup>54</sup>. We do not send signs except as a warning.","[53] So that the pagans of Makkah do do not face the consequences of the earlier nations.\n [54] i.e., they committed an injustice by hamstringing the she-camel."
  17,60,"And [remember, O Prophet] when We told you, “Your Lord encompasses all people [with His knowledge and might]<sup>55</sup>.” We did not make the sight which We showed you<sup>56</sup> except as a test for people, as well as the cursed tree [mentioned] in the Qur’an. We keep threatening them, yet it only increases them to greater transgression.","[55] i.e., Allah will protect you (ﷺ) from their harm.\n [56] During the journey of mi‘rāj (ascension) to the heavens."
  17,61,"And [remember] when We said to the angels, “Prostrate to Adam;” they all prostrated except Iblīs, who said, “Should I prostrate to whom You created from clay?”",""
  17,62,"He added, “Do You see this one whom You have honored above me? If you give me respite until the Day of Resurrection, I will surely overpower his offspring, except for a few<sup>57</sup>.”","[57] i.e., tempt and lead them astray."
  17,63,"Allah said, “Be gone<sup>58</sup>! Whoever among them follows you, Hell will be an ample recompense for you all.","[58] This and the next commands were actually a threat."
  17,64,"Entice with your voice whoever of them you can; mobilize against them your cavalry and infantry; manipulate them in their wealth<sup>59</sup> and children<sup>60</sup>, and make promises to them.” But Satan does not promise them except delusion<sup>61</sup>.","[59] i.e., earning and spending them sinfully.\n [60] i.e., having and raising them sinfully and giving them polytheistic names.\n [61] i.e., deception and fraudulence."
  17,65,"“You will have no authority over My slaves.” And sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.",""
  17,66,"It is your Lord Who makes the ships sail for you through the sea, so that you may seek of His bounty. Indeed, He is ever Merciful to you.",""
