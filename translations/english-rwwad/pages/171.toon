quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,160,"We divided them into twelve tribes<sup>62</sup>, each as a community, and We inspired Moses when his people asked him for water, “Strike the rock with your staff.” There gushed forth from it twelve springs; each tribe knew the place of its drinking. We shaded them with clouds and sent down to them manna and quails, “Eat of the good things We have provided for you.” They did not wrong Us, but it was themselves that they wronged.","[62] From the twelve sons of Jacob."
  7,161,"When it was said to them, “Live in this city [of Jerusalem], and eat from wherever you please, and say, ‘Absolve us,’ and enter the gate bowing with humility; We will forgive you your sins, and increase the reward of those who do good.”",""
  7,162,"But the wrongdoers among them altered the words to something other than what they were told; so We sent down upon them a scourge from the heaven for their wrongdoing.",""
  7,163,"Ask them [O Prophet] about the town which was by the sea and how they broke the Sabbath<sup>63</sup>. The fish would come to them appearing on the surface of the water on Sabbath days, but when it was not Sabbath, they would not come. This is how We tested them for their rebelliousness.","[63] This is another act of violation some of them committed."
