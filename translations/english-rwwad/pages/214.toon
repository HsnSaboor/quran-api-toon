quran[11]{c,v,t,f}:
  10,43,"And among them are some who look at you, but can you guide the blind even though they have no sight<sup>39</sup>?","[39] “It is not the eyes that turn blind, but it is the hearts within the breasts that turn blind.” See 22:46."
  10,44,"Allah does not wrong people in the least, but it is people who wrong themselves.",""
  10,45,"On the Day when He will gather them, it will be as if they had not stayed [in this world] except for an hour of a day, they will recognize one another<sup>40</sup>. Those who denied the meeting of Allah will be losers, for they did not follow guidance.","[40] Only then they will realize their fatal error, and their interaction will only be one of mutual reproach."
  10,46,"Whether We show you [O Prophet] some of that [punishment] of which We warn them, or We cause you to die, to Us is their return, and Allah is a Witness to all what they do.",""
  10,47,"For every people there is a messenger. When their messenger comes, it will be judged<sup>41</sup> between them with justice, and they will not be wronged.","[41] By his coming, wheat is sorted out from the chaff: Those who believe are saved but those who deny are doomed."
  10,48,"They say, “When will this warning<sup>42</sup> come to pass, if you are truthful?”","[42] i.e., their due punishment in this life or the coming of the Hour."
  10,49,"Say, “I have no power to harm or benefit myself, except by the Will of Allah.” For every people there is an appointed term; when their time comes, they can neither delay it for a moment nor can they bring it forward.",""
  10,50,"Say, “What do you think, if His punishment were to overtake you by night or by day, what part of it would the wicked seek to hasten<sup>43</sup>?","[43] They flippantly seek Allah’s punishment as proof of the Prophet’s (ﷺ) truthfulness."
  10,51,"Will you believe in it only after it befalls you<sup>44</sup>? Now! While you used to seek its hastening<sup>45</sup>?”","[44] i.e., it is too late to benefit from belief. [45] Challenging those who sought to bring it immediately."

  10,53,"They ask you, “Is it true?” Say, “Yes, by my Lord. It is certainly true, and you cannot escape it.”",""
