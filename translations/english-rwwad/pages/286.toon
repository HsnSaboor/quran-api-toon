quran[11]{c,v,t,f}:
  17,39,"This is part of the wisdom that your Lord has revealed to you [O Prophet]. Do not set up any other god with Allah, or you will be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected<sup>36</sup>.","[36] i.e., self-reproached and blamed by others for this miserable end, as well as shut away from all good."
  17,40,"Has your Lord favored you with sons and has taken for Himself angels as daughters<sup>37</sup>? You are indeed making a monstrous claim.","[37] Their feeble argument is debunked and refuted concerning the issue of purity of Faith and Monotheism. Although preferring male over female is a heathen way; yet, how would Allah, the Omnipotent Creator, accept for Himself what they do not accept for themselves? (cf. 37:149-155). They worshiped the angels based on the claim that they were Allah’s daughters. (cf. 43:19-20)."
  17,41,"We have explained things in various ways in this Qur’an, so that they may take heed, but it only increases them in aversion<sup>38</sup>.","[38] “We send down the Qur’an as a healing and mercy for the believers, but it does not increase the wrongdoers except in loss.” See below 17:82."
  17,42,"Say, “If there were other gods besides Him – as they claim – they would have surely sought a way to the Lord of the Throne<sup>39</sup>.”","[39] To please Him or take over His Throne."
  17,43,"Glorified and Highly Exalted is He far above what they claim!",""
  17,44,"The seven heavens and the earth, and all those in them glorify Him. There is not a single thing that does not glorify Him with His praise, but you do not understand their glorification. Indeed, He is Most Forbearing, All-Forgiving.",""
  17,45,"When you recite the Qur’an, We place between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter an invisible barrier<sup>40</sup>.","[40] Preventing guidance from them, for their aversion."
  17,46,"We have placed covers on their hearts so that they do not understand it, and deafness in their ears<sup>41</sup>. When you mention your Lord alone in the Qur’an, they turn their backs in aversion.","[41] This is in return for their hatred toward the truth and the ingrained disease of doubt in their hearts."
  17,47,"We are well aware of what they wish to hear when they listen to you, and what they say when they converse in private, when the wrongdoers say, “You are not following but a bewitched man.”",""
  17,48,"See how they call you names<sup>42</sup>! Thus they have gone astray and cannot find a way.","[42] i.e., a poet, a madman, bewitched, etc."
  17,49,"They say, “What! When we are turned into bones and dust, will we really be resurrected as a new creation?”",""
