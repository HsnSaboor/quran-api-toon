quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  10,7,"Those who do not expect to meet Us, and are pleased and content with the life of this world<sup>12</sup>, and those who are heedless of Our signs,","[12] They do not give a second’s thought to resurrection and reckoning; their current life is all that matters to them."
  10,8,"their abode will be the Fire, for what they used to earn.",""
  10,9,"As for those who believe and do righteous deeds<sup>13</sup>, their Lord will guide them by virtue of their faith. Rivers will flow beneath them in the Gardens of Bliss.","[13] Sincere Faith and good deeds lead to Paradise."
  10,10,"Their prayer will be, “Glorify be to You, O Allah,” and their greeting will be, “Peace,” and the closing of their prayer will be, “All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.”",""
  10,11,"If Allah were to hasten evil<sup>14</sup> to the people, just as they seek to hasten good<sup>15</sup>, they would have been ruined. But We leave those who do not expect to meet Us to wander blindly in their transgression.","[14] i.e., invoking against oneself or one’s children in anger.\n [15] “Man prays for evil as he prays for good, for man is ever hasty.” See 17:11."
  10,12,"When hardship befalls man, he calls upon Us, whether lying on his side, sitting or standing. But when We remove his hardship, he turns a blind eye as though he had never called upon Us to remove his hardship<sup>16</sup>. This is how the misdeeds of the transgressors are made appealing to them.","[16] “When We bestow favor upon man, he turns away and distances himself [from Us]; but when evil touches him, he is full of prolonged supplication.” See 41:51."
  10,13,"We destroyed the generations<sup>17</sup> before you when they indulged in wrongdoing, and their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they would not believe. This is how We recompense the wicked people.","[17] i.e., the people of Noah, ‘Ād, Thamūd, the people of Abraham, the dwellers of Midian, and the overturned cities [of Lot]” See 9:70."
  10,14,"Then We made you their successors in the land to see how you would behave<sup>18</sup>.","[18] The Messenger (ﷺ) said: “Life is alluringly lush green. Allah will make you successors in it to see what you do” [Muslim: 2742]."
