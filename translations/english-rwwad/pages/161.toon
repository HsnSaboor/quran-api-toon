quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,82,"The only reply his people gave was to say, “Drive them out of your town, for they are people who keep themselves pure<sup>31</sup>!”","[31] Their only charge was that they were ‘pure’."
  7,83,"So We saved him and his family except his wife<sup>32</sup>; she was one of those who remained behind.","[32] Because she condoned the degrading behavior of her people, and she was a disbeliever."
  7,84,"And We rained down upon them a rain [of brimstone]. So see how was the end of the evildoers.",""
  7,85,"And to the people of Midian [We sent] their brother Shu‘ayb. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god other than Him. There has come to you a clear proof from your Lord. Give full measure and weight, and do not defraud people of their property<sup>33</sup>, and do not spread corruption in the land after it has been set aright. That is best for you, if you are [truly] believers.","[33] Their sin was wantonly engaging in swindling defraud in dealings."
  7,86,"Do not lie in wait on every path, threatening and preventing from Allah’s path<sup>34</sup> those who believe in Him, and seeking to make it crooked. Remember when you were few, then He increased you in number. See how was the end of those who spread corruption.","[34] They were also engaged in highway robberies and preventing people from listening to Shu‘ayb."
  7,87,"If there are some among you who believe in what I have been sent with, while others do not believe, then be patient until Allah judges between us, and He is the Best of Judges.”",""
