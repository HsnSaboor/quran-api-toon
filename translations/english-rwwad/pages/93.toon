quran[3]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,92,"It is not for a believer to kill another believer except by mistake. Whoever kills a believer by mistake<sup>67</sup> must free a believing slave and pay blood money to his family, unless they waive it as an act of charity. But if the victim was a believer and belonged to people at war with you, then a believing slave must be freed. If he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty, then blood money must be paid to his family and the freeing of a believing slave. Anyone who is unable must fast for two consecutive months<sup>68</sup> by way of repentance to Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.","[67] Inadvertent manslaughter usually results from some degree of negligence or error, thus, this punishment is ordained for not being cautious enough.\n [68] Uninterrupted fast except when there is a valid reason, e.g., illness, menses for women etc."
  4,93,"But anyone who kills a believer deliberately, his punishment will be Hell, abiding therein forever; Allah will be displeased with him and will curse him, and will prepare for him a great punishment<sup>69</sup>.","[69] Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) said: ""A faithful believer remains at liberty regarding his religion unless he kills someone unlawfully."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 2]"
  4,94,"O you who believe, when you go to fight in the way of Allah, make sure [who you fight]; and do not say to someone who offers you the greetings of peace, “You are not a believer”<sup>70</sup> – seeking gains of the life of this world, while Allah has abundant gains. You were in the same position before, then Allah blessed you [with Islam]. Therefore make sure, for Allah is All-Aware of what you do.","[70] This is someone who withholds from fighting and declares that he is a believer."
