quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  13,43,"Those who disbelieve say, “You are not a messenger.” Say, “Allah is sufficient as a Witness between me and you, as well as those who have knowledge of the Scripture<sup>34</sup>.”","[34] As he is clearly mentioned in their Scripture."
  14,1,"Alif Lām Ra<sup>1</sup>. This is a book that We have sent down to you, so that you may bring people out of the depths of darkness into the light, by their Lord’s permission, to the path of the All-Mighty, the Praiseworthy.","[1] See footnote 2:1."
  14,2,"Allah, to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth. And woe to the disbelievers from a severe punishment!",""
  14,3,"Those who prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter and prevent [people] from Allah’s way, seeking to make it crooked<sup>2</sup>; it is they who have gone far astray.","[2] i.e., showing it as defective and imperfect."
  14,4,"We did not send any messenger but in the language of his people to make things clear for them. Allah causes to stray whom He wills<sup>3</sup> and guides whom He wills, and He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.","[3] i.e., those who refuse His guidance."
  14,5,"We sent Moses with Our signs [saying], “Bring your people out of the depths of darkness into the light, and remind them of Allah’s days<sup>4</sup>.
