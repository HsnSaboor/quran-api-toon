quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,187,"It has been made permissible for you to be intimate with your wives on the nights of the fast. They are a garment for you just as you are a garment for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He accepted your repentance and pardoned you. So now you may have intimacy with them<sup>84</sup> and seek what Allah has destined for you. And eat and drink until you see the light of dawn distinct from the darkness of night, then complete the fast until nightfall. However, should you be in a devotional retreat in the mosques then do not be intimate with them. These are the limits set by Allah, so do not even come near to them. This is how Allah makes His verses clear to people, so that they may become righteous.","[84] Prior to this revelation, marital relations were unlawful during nights preceding fasting. Some were unable to refrain and secretly disobeyed, but Allah accepted their repentance, and then it was made lawful."
  2,188,"Do not consume one another’s property unjustly, nor entice the rulers<sup>85</sup> in order to consume a portion of people’s property wrongfully while you know [it is sin].","[85] By offering bribes to those who rule in cases of litigation, i.e., judges."
  2,189,"They ask you about the phases of the moon. Say, “They are a means for people to determine time and pilgrimage.” It is not righteousness to enter the houses from the rear [in pilgrimage]<sup>86</sup>, but righteousness is to fear Allah. So enter the houses through their doors, and fear Allah so that you may succeed.","[86] It was an Arab practice prior to Islam to enter their houses from the back after assuming ihrām for pilgrimage, considering it an act of obedience."
  2,190,"Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight you<sup>87</sup>, but do not transgress<sup>88</sup>, for Allah does not like transgressors.","[87] This verse is the first one that was revealed in connection with Jihad.\n [88] Do not overlook the rulings prescribed for fighting, such as: not killing or harming women, children, the elderly, and those who did not aid the fight against you."
