quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,32,"For this reason, We ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a person – unless in retribution for murder or corruption in the land – it is as if he killed all mankind<sup>28</sup>; and whoever saves a life, it is as if he saved the life of all mankind. Our messengers came to them with clear signs, yet many of them continued to exceed the limits<sup>29</sup> afterward in the land.","[28] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""The biggest of sins are: (1) To associate partners with Allah, (2) to murder a human being, (3) to be undutiful to one’s parents (4) and to give a false testimony"" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 10]\n [29] By unreservedly committing grave vile deeds."
  5,33,"The penalty<sup>30</sup> for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and spread corruption in the land<sup>31</sup>, is that they should be executed, or crucified, or their hands and feet amputated on opposite sides, or banished from the land<sup>32</sup>. This is a disgrace for them in this world, and for them in the Hereafter, there will be a great punishment.","[30] Legal retribution.\n [31] i.e., commit acts of violence and terrorism against individuals or treason and aggression against the Islamic state.\n [32] This verse details the penal code for such acts as highway robbery and banditry, known as hadd al-hirābah (the penal code of waging war)."
  5,34,"Except those who repent before you seize them; in that case, then know that Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  5,35,"O you who believe, fear Allah and seek the means of nearness to Him<sup>33</sup>, and struggle in His way, so that you may succeed.","[33] By doing what pleases Allah Almighty."
  5,36,"As for those who disbelieved, even if they were to possess everything on earth and the like of it to ransom themselves<sup>34</sup> from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them, and for them there will be a painful punishment.","[34] See 3:91; 13:18; 39:47."
