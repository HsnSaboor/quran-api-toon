quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  13,14,"To Him alone should all supplication be addressed<sup>12</sup>. But those whom they supplicate besides Him do not respond to them in any way, except like one who stretches out his hands for water to reach his mouth, but it will never reach it<sup>13</sup>. The supplication of the disbelievers is all in vain.","[12] i.e., the testimony of faith (There is no true god but Allah).\n [13] The analogy indicates that false deities will never respond to them."
  13,15,"To Allah prostrates<sup>14</sup> whoever is in the heavens and on earth, willingly or unwillingly, and so do their shadows in the morning and evening.","[14] There are two types of prostrations: sujūd shar‘i (Intentional prostration) and sujūd qadari (Unintentional prostration). See also 3:83."
  13,16,"Say, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and earth?” Say, “Allah.” Say, “Have you taken besides Him protectors, those who have no power to benefit or harm themselves<sup>15</sup>?” Say, “Can the blind person be equal to the seeing<sup>16</sup>, or can the darkness be equal to the light?” Or do they ascribe to Allah partners who created the like of His creation<sup>17</sup>, so they are confused between two creations? Say, “Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Subjugator.”","[15] The claimed partners cannot be compared to Allah in any way.\n [16] Disbelievers are ‘blind’ to the Truth and the believers can see the Truth plainly as it is.\n [17] Their so-called ‘gods’ could not answer their prayers or do them good or harm, let alone perform such a great act as that of creation."
  13,17,"He sends down rain from the sky, causing the valleys to flow, each according to its capacity, and the torrent carries along rising foam, similar to the slag produced from metal that people melt in the fire to make ornaments or tools. This is how Allah compares truth to falsehood: as for the residue, it is then cast away, but that which benefits people remains on the earth<sup>18</sup>. This is how Allah sets forth comparisons.","[18] Truth is the water that stays and people benefit from it, whereas falsehood is the scum that soon dissolves and disappears; likewise is the slag of minerals."
  13,18,"Those who respond to their Lord will have the best reward<sup>19</sup>. As for those who do not respond to Him, even if they were to possess all that is on earth and the likes thereof, they would surely offer it to ransom themselves; they will have the worst reckoning<sup>20</sup>, and their abode will be Hell. What a terrible resting place!","[19] al-Husnā (lit. the best reward) is a good reward in this life and Paradise in the Hereafter.\n [20] Their good deeds will not be accepted from them and they will be asked about their minute misdeeds."
