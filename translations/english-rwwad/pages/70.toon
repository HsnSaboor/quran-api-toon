quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,154,"Then He sent down tranquility upon you after distress: a slumber overtaking a group of you<sup>70</sup>, while another group<sup>71</sup> cared only about themselves, having false thoughts about Allah, the untrue thoughts of ignorance, saying, “Do we have any say in the matter?” Say, “All matters belong to Allah.” They conceal in their hearts what they do not reveal to you. They say, “If we had any say in the matter, none of us would have been killed here.” Say, “Even if you had been in your homes, those among you who were destined to be killed would have come out to their killing places.” But Allah did this so that He may test your inner thoughts and distinguish what is in your hearts. For Allah is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts.","[70] The real believers.\n [71] The hypocrites."
  3,155,"Those of you who fled on the day when the two armies met [at ’Uhud], it was Satan who made them slip due to some of their misdeeds, but Allah has pardoned them, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.",""
  3,156,"O you who believe, do not be like those who disbelieved and said about their brothers who traveled through the land or engaged in battle, “If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed<sup>72</sup>.” Allah makes that a cause of distress in their hearts. It is Allah Who gives life and causes death, and Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.","[72] A believer should know for certain that all matters, including life and death, are in the Hands of Allah alone."
  3,157,"If you are killed in the way of Allah or die, then forgiveness and mercy from Allah are far better than what they accumulate.",""
