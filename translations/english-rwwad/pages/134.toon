quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,53,"Thus We have tested some of them by means of others, so that they may say, “Are these the ones whom Allah has favored among us<sup>15</sup>?” Does Allah not know best those who are grateful?","[15] The poor Muslims with the Prophet (ﷺ). The influential leaders of Quraysh disdained sitting with them."
  6,54,"When those who believe in Our verses come to you, say, “Peace be upon you. Your Lord has decreed mercy upon Himself; whoever among you commits a sin out of ignorance then repents afterwards and mends his ways, then Allah is indeed All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”",""
  6,55,"This is how We explain the verses in detail, so that the way of the evildoers may become known.",""
  6,56,"Say, “I have been forbidden to worship those whom you supplicate besides Allah.” Say, “I do not follow your desires<sup>16</sup>. If I did, I would go astray and I would not be one of those who are guided.”","[16] Following vain desires is what leads people to stray."
  6,57,"Say [O Prophet], “I am on clear evidence from my Lord, yet you have denied it. I do not have that [punishment] which you seek to hasten. The decision rests with Allah alone; He tells the truth and He is the Best of Judges.”",""
  6,58,"Say, “If that which you seek to hasten were within my power, the matter would have already been decided between me and you. But Allah knows best the wrongdoers.”",""
  6,59,"He alone has the keys of the unseen<sup>17</sup>; no one knows them except Him. He knows what is in the land and sea. Not a leaf falls without His knowledge, nor a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor anything moist or dry, but is [written] in a Clear Record<sup>18</sup>.","[17] Keys of the Unseen, such as the knowledge of the Hour; sending down of rain; knowledge of what is in the wombs. No one knows what one will earn for tomorrow, and where one will die. See 31:34.\n [18] The Preserved Tablet."
