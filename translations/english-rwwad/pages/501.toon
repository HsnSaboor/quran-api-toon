quran[10]{c,v,t,f}:
  45,23,"Have you seen the one who took his whims as his god, and Allah caused him to stray despite having knowledge<sup>6</sup>, and sealed up his hearing and heart, and put a cover over his sight? Who can guide him after Allah? Will you not then take heed?","[6] Or Allah’s eternal knowledge of that person's preference for his own inclinations over divine guidance."
  45,24,"And they say, “There is nothing but our life of this world: we die and we live<sup>7</sup>, and nothing causes us to die except time.” They have no knowledge of that; they only speculate.","[7] i.e., some of us die without return, and others are born replacing them."
  45,25,"When Our clear verses are recited to them, their only argument is to say: “Bring our forefathers back, if you are truthful.”",""
  45,26,"Say, “It is Allah Who gives you life then causes you to die, then He will gather you on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt, but most people do not know.”",""
  45,27,"To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth. On the day when the Hour will take place, the people of falsehood will be in total loss.",""
  45,28,"You will see every community on its knees. Every community will be summoned to its book [of deeds], “Today you will be recompensed for what you used to do.",""
  45,29,"This is Our Record that tells the truth about you, for We<sup>8</sup> used to record all what you used to do.”","[8] By Our angel scribes."
  45,30,"As for those who believed and did righteous deeds, their Lord will admit them into His mercy. That is indeed the clear triumph.",""
  45,31,"But those who disbelieved [will be asked], “When My verses were recited to you, did you not show arrogance and were a wicked people?",""
  45,32,"Whenever it was said, ‘Allah’s promise is certainly true and there is no doubt about the Hour,’ you said, ‘We do not know what the Hour is; We think it is just an assumption, and we are not convinced.’”",""
