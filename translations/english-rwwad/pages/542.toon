quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  58,1,"Indeed, Allah has heard the words of the woman who was arguing with you [O Prophet] concerning her husband and was complaining to Allah. Allah has heard the discussion between the two of you, for Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing<sup>1</sup>.","[1] Khawlah bint Tha‘labah and her husband Aws ibn As-Sāmit had a disagreement. She came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said that her husband made her unlawful to himself as the zahr (back) of his mother, which was a famous type of divorce in Arabia, called zihār. He (ﷺ) told her that he had not received any revelation in this regard. Finally, this Madinian surah was revealed, and abolished this ancient practice."
  58,2,"As for those among you who divorce their wives by likening them to their mothers<sup>2</sup>, they are not their mothers; their mothers are none but those who gave birth to them. They utter words that are abhorrent and false, but Allah is Most Pardoning, Most Forgiving.","[2] By saying to one's wife, ""You are to me like the back of my mother,"" meaning unlawful to approach, which was abolished by the revelation of these verses."
  58,3,"But those who divorce their wives by likening them to their mothers then retract what they said, they must free a slave before they are intimate with each other. This is what you are admonished, and Allah is All-Aware of what you do.",""
  58,4,"But whoever cannot afford this must fast for two consecutive months<sup>3</sup> before the couple have intimate relations with each other. But if he is unable to do that, he must feed sixty needy people. This is so that you may truly believe in Allah and His Messenger. These are the limits ordained by Allah, and for the disbelievers there will be a painful punishment.","[3] See footnote 4:92."
  58,5,"Indeed, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger will be debased, just as those who came before them were debased, for We have surely sent down clear signs. And for the disbelievers there will be a humiliating punishment.",""
  58,6,"On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all together and will inform them of what they did; Allah has kept their complete record, while they have forgotten it. For Allah is a Witness over all things.",""
