quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,96,"If only the people of the towns had believed and feared Allah, We would have certainly opened for them blessings from the heaven and earth. But they disbelieved, so We seized them for what they earned.",""
  7,97,"Do the people of the towns feel secure that Our punishment will not befall them by night while they are asleep?",""
  7,98,"Or do the people of the towns feel secure that Our punishment will not befall them by day while they are at play?",""
  7,99,"Do they feel secure from the plan of Allah? None can feel secure from the plan of Allah<sup>37</sup> except the loser people.","[37] Even the most devout believers, as hearts are between the two Fingers of Allah, He directs it wherever He wishes."
  7,100,"Is it not clear to those who inherit the land after its former people that, if We so willed, We could punish them for their sins and seal up their hearts so that they do not hear<sup>38</sup>?","[38] For they do not benefit from what they hear."
  7,101,"These are the towns, some of whose stories We relate to you. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they were not about to believe in what they had already rejected<sup>39</sup>. This is how Allah seals up the hearts of the disbelievers.","[39] i.e., they persistently denied warnings given to them."
  7,102,"We did not find most of them committed to their covenant; rather We found most of them rebellious.",""
  7,103,"Then We sent after them Moses<sup>40</sup> with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them.

  7,104,"Moses said, “O Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds.",""
