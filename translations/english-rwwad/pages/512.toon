quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  48,10,"Those who pledge allegiance to you [O Prophet] are indeed pledging allegiance to Allah; Allah’s Hand is over their hands<sup>4</sup>. Whoever breaks his pledge, he only breaks it to his own detriment, but whoever fulfills his covenant with Allah, He will give him a great reward.","[4] i.e., Allah Almighty approved their pledge."
  48,11,"Those of the Bedouins who lagged behind will say to you, “We were preoccupied with our wealth and our families, so ask for forgiveness for us.” They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say, “Then who can prevent Allah if He intends to harm or benefit you? Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of what you do.",""
  48,12,"But you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families ever, and that was made appealing in your hearts. You harbored evil thoughts, for you are a doomed people.”",""
  48,13,"Whoever does not believe in Allah and His Messenger, We have certainly prepared for the disbelievers a Blazing Fire.",""
  48,14,"To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills, and Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  48,15,"Those who lagged behind will say when you set out to collect the spoils of war, “Let us follow you.” They wish to change the word of Allah<sup>5</sup>. Say, “You will never follow us; this is what Allah has already decreed.” They will then say, “Rather, you are jealous of us<sup>6</sup>.” Rather, they do not understand but a little<sup>7</sup>.","[5] Allah promised those of the believers who pledged allegiance at Hudaybiyah that the spoils of war obtained from the Jews of Khaybar be exclusively for them.\n [6] i.e., you only ask us not to go with you to the spoils of Khsybar to deprive us of our share.\n [7] i.e., they do not understand but the material aspects of life."
