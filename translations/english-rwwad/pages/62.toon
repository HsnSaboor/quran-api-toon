quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,92,"You will never attain righteousness<sup>40</sup> until you spend in charity from what you love. Whatever you spend, Allah is All-Knowing of it.","[40] ""Al-Birr"" is sincere piety which leads to the great bounty and Paradise."
  3,93,"All food was permissible for the Children of Israel except what Israel [i.e., Jacob] made impermissible for himself<sup>41</sup> before the Torah was sent down. Say, “Bring the Torah and recite it, if you are truthful.”","[41] Israel (Jacob) became very ill and his illness dragged on for a long time, then he vowed that he would make unlawful for himself the drink and food he loved most should Allah cure him. The best food for him was camel meat and the drink he loved most was camel milk."
  3,94,"Whoever fabricates lies upon Allah after that – it is they who are the wrongdoers.",""
  3,95,"Say, “Allah has spoken the truth, so follow the religion of Abraham<sup>42</sup>, exclusively devoted to Allah, and he was not one of the polytheists.”","[42] The creed of Ibrāhīm (millata Ibrāhīm) is the most primordial precursor to Islam. It is mentioned in the Qur’an in various places: 2:130, 3:95, 4:125, 6:161 and 16:123."
  3,96,"The first House [of worship] established for mankind was the one at Bakkah [i.e., Makkah], full of blessings<sup>43</sup> and guidance for the worlds.","[43] Of this, is that people direct themselves toward it in prayer and head for it for ‘Umrah and Hajj."
  3,97,"In it are clear signs [such as] the standing place of Abraham<sup>44</sup>; whoever enters it will be safe. Pilgrimage to the House is a duty owed to Allah upon all people who are able to make their way to it; whoever disbelieves, then Allah is in no need for the worlds<sup>45</sup>.","[44] It is the stone on which Abraham (عليه السلام) stood while building the Ka‘ba. It is an everlasting sign of the relationship of Islam to Abraham’s creed. [45] He is in no need for His servants’ worship; it is they who are in need of Him."
  3,98,"Say, “O People of the Book, why do you reject the verses of Allah when Allah is Witness to all what you do?”",""
  3,99,"Say, “O People of the Book, why do you hinder the believers from the way of Allah – trying to make it crooked when you are witnesses [to its truth]<sup>46</sup>? But Allah is not unaware of what you do.”","[46] They were devising schemes to deviate people while secretly bearing witness to the Truth mentioned in their Books."
  3,100,"O you who believe, if you obey a group of those who were given the Scripture, they will turn you back as disbelievers after your belief.",""
