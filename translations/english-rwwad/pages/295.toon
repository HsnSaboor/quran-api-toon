quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  18,16,"When you have distanced yourselves from them and what they worship other than Allah, take refuge in the cave; your Lord will extend His mercy to you and make for you an easy way out of your ordeal.”",""
  18,17,"You would have seen the sun when it rose, it would incline away from their Cave to the right; and when it set, it would turn away from them to the left<sup>11</sup>, while they were in its open space. That was one of the signs of Allah. Whoever Allah guides is rightly guided, and whoever He causes to stray, you will never find for him a protecting guide.","[11] As such they would get all the air and ventilation they needed to sustain."
  18,18,"You would have thought they were awake, although they were asleep. We turned them over on their right and left sides, when their dog stretched its forelegs at the entrance. If you had seen them, you would have fled away from them, filled with horror<sup>12</sup>.","[12] Should anyone were to see them, he would see a group of awake men with a dog standing guarding them, and would surely be filled with horror, which was a factor in preserving them, so no one would dare to draw close to them."
  18,19,"Similarly, We awakened them so that they might question one another. One of them said, “How long have you been here?” They said, “We have been here for a day or part of a day.” They said, “Your Lord knows best how long have you been here. Send one of you with these silver coins of yours to the city, and let him see who has the most pure food and bring some provision from it. And be cautious and let no one know about you.",""
  18,20,"For if they find out about you, they will stone you or force you back to their religion, and then you will never succeed.”",""
