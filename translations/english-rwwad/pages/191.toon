quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,27,"Then afterward, Allah will accept the repentance of whom He wills, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  9,28,"O you who believe, the polytheists are impure<sup>23</sup>, so do not let them come near the Sacred Mosque after this year. If you fear poverty, Allah will enrich you out of His bounty<sup>24</sup>, if He wills. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.","[23] Impurity here means: disbelief, vile manners and unholy character.\n [24] Because the pilgrimage site was the major trading season in Arabia at that time."
  9,29,"Fight those of the People of the Book who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, nor do they consider forbidden what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, nor adopt the religion of truth [i.e., Islam], until they pay the protection tax<sup>25</sup> willingly while they are humbled.","[25] Jizyah: is a tax levied from the people of the Book (Jews and Christians). It is only taken from those who can afford it; to enjoy privileges such as protection, freedom of religion, and fair treatment. Furthermore, they are exempted from military service as well as zakah is not taken from them, which are only due upon Muslims."
  9,30,"The Jews say, “Ezra<sup>26</sup> is the son of Allah,” and the Christians say, “The Messiah is the son of Allah<sup>27</sup>.” These are mere words that they utter, imitating the words of the disbelievers before them<sup>28</sup>. May Allah ruin them; how can they be deluded?","[26] ‘Uzayr or Ezra: It was he who restored and codified the Torah after it had been lost during the Babylonian Exile, and edited it in more or less in the form which it is today.\n [27] See 2:116. [28] In saying that Allah has taken to Himself a son, as polytheists before them said that angels are Allah’s daughters."
  9,31,"They have taken their rabbis and monks as lords<sup>29</sup> besides Allah, as well as the Messiah, son of Mary, even though they were commanded to worship only One God; none has the right to be worshiped except Him, glorified is He far above what they associate with Him<sup>30</sup>.","[29] By obeying them rather than obeying Allah’s commandments.\n [30] ‘Adiyy ibn Hātim al-Tā’iyy (رضي الله عنه), who was Christian before embracing Islam, narrated that he came to the Messenger (ﷺ) while he was reciting this verse, and he said to the Messenger: “We do not worship them!” He asked: “Do they not deem unlawful what Allah allowed and you follow them making it unlawful, and declare lawful what Allah forbade and you follow them making it lawful?” ‘Adiyy said: “Indeed!” then he (ﷺ) said: “That is their worship!” [At-Tirmidhī: 3095; also see: Matthew 15:1-9, Isaiah 29:13, Jeremiah 8:8]"
