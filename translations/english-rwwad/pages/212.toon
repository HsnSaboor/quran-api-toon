  10,26,"For those who do good, there will be the best reward and more<sup>28</sup> – neither gloom nor humiliation will cover their faces<sup>29</sup>. It is they who are the people of Paradise, they will abide therein forever.","[28] Paradise and they will be able to see Allah Almighty. [cf. Sahih Muslim:181]\n [29] “On that Day some faces will be bright, looking at their Lord” See 75:22-23."
  10,27,"As for those who commit evil deeds, the recompense of an evil deed is the like thereof, and humiliation will cover them<sup>30</sup> – there will be none to protect them from Allah – as if their faces were covered with patches of the darkest night. It is they who are the people of the Fire, they will abide therein forever.","[30] “On the Day of Resurrection, you will see those who lied against Allah with their faces darkened” See 39:60."
  10,28,"On the Day when We gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated partners with Us, “Stay where you are, you and your [so-called] partners!” Then We will separate them, and their partners<sup>31</sup> will say, “It was not us that you used to worship!","[31] i.e., with Allah."
  10,29,"Allah is sufficient as a Witness between us and you that we were completely unaware of your worship.”",""

Who controls all things?” They will say, “Allah<sup>32</sup>.” Say, “Do you not then fear Him?","[32] These are some of the most potent signs of Allah’s Lordship, Who is the sole rightful to worship."
  10,32,"Such is Allah, your True Lord. What is beyond the truth except falsehood? So how could you be averted [from the truth]?”",""
  10,33,"Thus the decree of your Lord has come true against the wicked, that they will never believe<sup>33</sup>.","[33] That is the predestined decree that the ardently rebellious will never be guided."
