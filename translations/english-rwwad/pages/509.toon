quran[10]{c,v,t,f}:
  47,20,"Those who believe say, “If only a Chapter were sent down [about fighting]? But when a precise Chapter is sent down and fighting<sup>15</sup> is mentioned therein, you see those in whose hearts is sickness looking at you like someone who is about to die. It would have been better for them<sup>16</sup>","[15] The believers longed for a Qur’anic revelation that would give them permission to fight their enemies.\n [16] It could also mean “Woe to them!” if disconnected from the next verse."
  47,21,"to obey and say good words. Once the fighting was ordained, it would be better for them to be truthful to Allah.",""
  47,22,"Then if you turn away<sup>17</sup>, what else can be expected but that you will spread corruption in the land and sever your ties of kinship<sup>18</sup>?","[17] From Islam or from struggling in the way of Allah.\n [18] As you used to do in the pre-Islamic period of ignorance."
  47,23,"These are the ones whom Allah has cursed and has made them deaf and blinded their sight.",""
  47,24,"Do they not reflect upon the Qur’an, or are there locks upon their hearts?",""
  47,25,"Indeed, those who turn back [to disbelief] after guidance had become clear to them, it is Satan who has tempted them and deceived them with false hopes of a long life.",""
  47,26,"That is because they say to those<sup>19</sup> who hate what Allah has sent down, “We will obey you in some matters<sup>20</sup>.” But Allah knows their secret schemes.","[19] i.e., the Jews of Madīnah.\n [20] i.e., your hostility to the Prophet (ﷺ) and hindering people from participation in Jihad."
  47,27,"How will they feel when the angels take their souls, striking their faces and their backs?",""
  47,28,"That is because they follow what incurs Allah’s wrath and they hate what pleases Him, so He will render their deeds worthless.",""
  47,29,"Do those in whose hearts is sickness think that Allah will never expose their malice?",""
