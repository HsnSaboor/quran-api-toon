  7,12,"Allah said, “What prevented you from prostrating when I ordered you?” He said, “I am better than him; You created me from fire and created him from clay.”",""
  7,13,"Allah said, “Then get down from here! It is not for you to show arrogance<sup>3</sup> here. Get out, for you are one of the disgraced.”","[3] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “None who has a mote’s weight of arrogance in his heart shall enter Paradise.” [Muslim: 91]."
  7,14,"He said, “Grant me respite until the Day they are resurrected.”",""
  7,15,"Allah said, “You are of those who are granted respite”.",""
  7,16,"He said, “Since You have led me astray<sup>4</sup>, I will certainly lie in wait for them on Your straight path.","[4] By citing predestination (al-qadar), Satan sets the record for being the first to use al-qadar as a pretext for not following Allah’s command (al-’amr) as an excuse to justify his rebelliousness against Him."
  7,17,"Then I will come against them from their front and from their back, from their right and from their left<sup>5</sup>, and You will not find most of them grateful.”","[5] This shows how purposeful and determined Satan really is in his mission. Such an enemy should be guarded against with constant vigilance."
  7,18,"Allah said, “Get out of here, disgraced and expelled! I will certainly fill Hell with you and those who follow you all together.”",""
  7,19,"“O Adam, dwell in Paradise, you and your wife, and eat from wherever you wish, but do not approach this tree, or else you will both be among the wrongdoers.”",""

  7,21,"And he swore to them, “I am indeed your sincere adviser.”",""
  7,22,"So he deluded them both with deception. When they tasted the tree, their private parts became visible to them, so they began to put together leaves of the Garden to cover themselves. Their Lord called them, “Did I not forbid you from that tree and tell you that Satan is your sworn enemy?”",""
