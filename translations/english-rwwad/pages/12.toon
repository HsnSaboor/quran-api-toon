  2,77,"Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal?",""
  2,78,"And among them, there are illiterate people, who know nothing of the Scripture except wishful thinking, and they do nothing but guesswork.",""
  2,79,"So woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands, and then say, “This is from Allah,” in order to trade it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn.",""
  2,80,"And they say, “The Fire will never touch us except for a few days.” Say, “Have you taken a covenant from Allah; for Allah will never break His covenant, or are you saying about Allah what you do not know?”",""
  2,81,"No indeed! Those who do evil and are surrounded by their sins – they are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.",""
  2,82,"But those who believe and do righteous deeds – they are the people of Paradise; they will abide therein forever.",""
  2,83,"And [remember] when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, “Do not worship except Allah; be kind to parents and kindred, and to orphans and those in need; speak good words to people; establish prayer; and give Zakah.” But then you turned away paying no heed, except a few of you.",""
