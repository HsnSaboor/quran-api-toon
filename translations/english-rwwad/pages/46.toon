quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,270,"Whatever charity you give or vow<sup>167</sup> you make, Allah surely knows it. But the wrongdoers have no helpers.","[167] Nadhr (vowing): It is to make obligatory for oneself that which is not, usually in return for a Godly favor. For example, if my child is healed, I will give in charity such amount of money."
  2,271,"If you give charity publicly, it is good; but if you give it secretly to the poor, it is better for you<sup>168</sup>, and He will expiate some of your sins. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.","[168] Observing secrecy while giving out voluntary charity to the poor is better than making it public, for it ensures his dignity and is closer to sincerity."
  2,272,"You are not responsible for their guidance [O Prophet], but Allah guides whom He wills. Whatever wealth you spend in charity, it is for your own good – as long as you do so seeking Allah’s pleasure. And whatever wealth you spend in charity, you will be rewarded in full, and you will not be wronged.",""
  2,273,"[Charity is] for the poor who are fully occupied in the cause of Allah, unable to move about in the land [for livelihood]; the one who is unaware would think that they are rich because of their self-restraint. You will recognize them by their appearance. They do not ask people importunately. And whatever wealth you give, then Allah is All-Knowing of it.",""
  2,274,"Those who spend their wealth in charity, day and night, in secret and in public; they will have their reward with their Lord, and they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.",""
