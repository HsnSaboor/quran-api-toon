quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  47,12,"Allah will surely admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens under which rivers flow. As for those who disbelieve, they enjoy themselves [in this world] and they eat as cattle eat<sup>8</sup>; their final abode is the Fire.","[8] The disbelievers enjoy their life while they are oblivious of their consequences in the Hereafter, just like the cattle that graze in the pasture not knowing that they will probably be slaughtered soon."
  47,13,"How many towns We destroyed that were more powerful than your town that expelled you, and there was none to help them!",""
  47,14,"Are those who possess clear proof from their Lord like those whose evil deeds are made appealing to them and who follow their own desires?",""
  47,15,"The likeness of Paradise promised to the righteous is that of a [garden which has] rivers of fresh water<sup>9</sup>; rivers of milk the taste of which never changes; rivers of wine delicious to drink; and rivers of pure honey. They will have therein all kinds of fruit and forgiveness from their Lord. Can they be like those who will abide in the Fire forever, and will be given boiling water to drink that tears apart their intestines?","[9] Neither stagnant nor polluted."
  47,16,"Among these [hypocrites] are some who listen to you [O Prophet], but when they leave your presence, they say to those who were given knowledge<sup>10</sup>, “What did he just say<sup>11</sup>?” It is they whose hearts Allah has sealed up and who follow their desires.","[10] From among the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ).\n [11] In an ignoring and indifferent manner."
  47,17,"As for those who follow guidance, He increases them in guidance and blesses them with righteousness<sup>12</sup>.","[12] Taqwā: It means piety, fear and consciousness of Allah, and care to avoid displeasing Him."
  47,18,"Are they but waiting for the Hour to come upon them by surprise? Already [some of] its signs have appeared<sup>13</sup>. What good will it do them to take heed when it actually befalls them?","[13] Such as the coming of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), and the splitting of the moon after the pagans of Makkah challenged the Prophet (ﷺ) which was fulfilled before their eyes, yet they denied that miracle."
  47,19,"Then know [O Prophet] that none has the right to be worshiped except Allah, and seek forgiveness for your sins<sup>14</sup> and for the [the sins of] the believing men and women, for Allah knows your movements and your places of rest.","[14] See footnote 40:55. Since the Prophet (ﷺ) is urged to seek forgiveness, the believers are far greater in need of seeking Allah’s forgiveness."
