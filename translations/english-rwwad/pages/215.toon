quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  10,54,"If every wrongdoer were to possess all that is on earth, he would surely offer it to ransom himself. They will hide their remorse<sup>46</sup> when they see the punishment. They will be judged in all fairness, and they will not be wronged.","[46] Profound remorse and sorrow is a type of self-punishment, which is not less severe than imposed punishment."
  10,55,"Indeed, to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and earth. Allah’s promise is certainly true, but most of them do not know.",""
  10,56,"It is He Who gives life and causes death, and to Him you will all be returned.",""

  10,60,"What do those who fabricate lies against Allah think of it on the Day of Judgment<sup>49</sup>? Indeed, Allah is bountiful to people, yet most of them are ungrateful.","[49] “On the Day of Resurrection, you will see those who lied against Allah with their faces darkened. Is there not in Hell an abode for the arrogant?” See 39:60."
  10,61,"Whatever matter you [O Prophet] may be engaged in, and whatever portion of the Qur’an you may recite, and whatever deed you [O people] may do, We are a Witness over you when you are engaged in it. Nothing is hidden from your Lord, not even an atom’s weight on earth nor in heaven, nor anything smaller or greater than that, except that it is [written] in a clear Record<sup>50</sup>.","[50] It soothes and assuages the believing community; that their deeds are recorded and that they are more successful side."
