quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,71,"They thought that there would be no consequences, so they became blind and deaf [to the truth]. Then Allah forgave them, but again many of them became blind and deaf. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.",""
  5,72,"They have certainly disbelieved, those who say, “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary.” But the Messiah said, “O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord<sup>56</sup>.” Whoever associates any partners with Allah, Allah has forbidden Paradise for him, and his abode will be the Fire. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers.","[56] This and the next verse addressed the Lordship and Divinity of Jesus. See 2:165."
  5,73,"They have certainly disbelieved, those who say, “Allah is one of Three<sup>57</sup>.” None has the right to be worshiped except One God. If they do not desist from saying this, those who disbelieve from among them will be afflicted with a painful punishment.","[57] i.e., a part of the three, referring to the Christian concept of the Trinity."
  5,74,"Why do they not turn to Allah in repentance and seek His forgiveness? For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  5,75,"The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger. There were messengers who passed away before him, and His mother was a woman of truth; they both ate food<sup>58</sup>. See how We make Our signs clear to them, yet see how they are deluded!","[58] They both were in need of sustenance, proving that they were not divine beings, unlike Allah Almighty Who is in no need of anything while everything is in need of Him."
  5,76,"Say, “Do you worship besides Allah that which can neither harm nor benefit you?! And Allah is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.”",""
