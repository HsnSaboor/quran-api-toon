quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,149,"O you who believe, if you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on your heels, and thus you will return as losers.",""
  3,150,"But Allah is your Protector, and He is the Best of Helpers.",""
  3,151,"We will cast dread into the hearts of those who disbelieve because they associated partners with Allah for which He has not sent down any authority. Their refuge will be the Fire. How terrible is the abode of the wrongdoers!",""
  3,152,"Indeed, Allah fulfilled His promise to you when you were slaying them by His permission, until you lost courage and disputed over the command and disobeyed after He had shown you what you liked [victory]. Among you are some who seek this world and some who seek the Hereafter<sup>68</sup>. He then prevented you from [defeating] them so that He may test You, but He pardoned you, for Allah is Most Gracious to the believers.","[68] The first party were the archers who left their positions to collect the spoils, while the latter were those who remained at their posts."
  3,153,"[Remember] when you were fleeing without even casting a glance at anyone, and the Messenger was calling you back. You were then given distress<sup>69</sup> upon distress, so you should not grieve for what you missed or for what you suffered. For Allah is All-Aware of what you do.","[69] The news of the rumored death of the Prophet (ﷺ) hit them after losing the ground in the battle, so they soon forgot the defeat that had been inflicted on them."
