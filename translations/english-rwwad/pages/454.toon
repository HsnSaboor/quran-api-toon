quran[10]{c,v,t,f}:
  38,17,"Bear with patience whatever they say, and remember Our slave David, the man of strength who constantly turned [to Allah].",""
  38,18,"We subjected the mountains to join him in glorifying Allah in the evening and the morning,",""
  38,19,"and the birds, in their flocks; they all would echo his praise.",""
  38,20,"We strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and sound judgment [and speech].",""
  38,21,"Has there come to you the story of the adversaries, when they climbed the wall of his chamber?",""
  38,22,"When they entered upon David, he was frightened. They said, “Do not be afraid. We are two adversaries: one of us has wronged the other, so judge between us with fairness, and do not be unjust, and guide us to the straight path.",""
  38,23,"This is my brother<sup>12</sup>. He has ninety-nine ewes while I have only one. He said, ‘Give her into my charge,’ and he overpowered me in speech.”","[12] i.e., brother in faith, business partner, or biological brother."
  38,24,"David said, “He has certainly wronged you by demanding that your ewe be added to his flock. Indeed, many partners oppress one another, except those who believe and do righteous deeds – and how few they are.” Then David realized that We were only testing him, so he asked his Lord for forgiveness<sup>13</sup>, fell down in prostration, and turned to Him in repentance.","[13] For fear of the two men or the misjudgment he made."
  38,25,"So We forgave that for him, and he certainly has a place of nearness to Us and a good place of return.",""
  38,26,"“O David, We have made you a ruler on earth, so judge between people with justice, and do not follow your desires lest they lead you astray from Allah’s way. Those who go astray from Allah’s way will have a severe punishment because of their forgetting the Day of Reckoning.”",""
