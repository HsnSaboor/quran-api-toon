quran[10]{c,v,t,f}:
  17,18,"Whoever desires this fleeting life<sup>16</sup>, We hasten therein whatever We will to whoever We please. Then We prepare for him Hell, which he will enter, despised and rejected.","[16] i.e., worldly pleasures."
  17,19,"But whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it as he should, being a believer – it is those whose efforts will be appreciated<sup>17</sup>.","[17] Allah will accept their good deeds, multiply their reward, and overlook their sins."
  17,20,"We give both – the latter and the former – from the bounty of your Lord, and Your Lord’s bounty is not restricted<sup>18</sup>.","[18] Allah gives provision for all in the life of this world without exception."
  17,21,"See how We have favored some over others [in this world], but the Hereafter has higher ranks and greater degrees of excellence for some over others<sup>19</sup>.","[19] In beauty, wealth, power, knowledge, etc; as a test for them, to see how they react."
  17,22,"Do not set up with Allah any other god, or else you will be despised and forsaken<sup>20</sup>.","[20] Having none to thank them for it, nor support them in the least."
  17,23,"Your Lord has ordained that you worship none but Him, and show kindness to parents. If one or both of them reach old age in your care, do not say to them a word of annoyance<sup>21</sup> nor scold them, rather speak to them noble words,","[21] ’uff: an expression of irritation and disapproval."
  17,24,"and lower to them the wing of humility<sup>22</sup> out of mercy, and say, “My Lord, have mercy upon them as they raised me when I was small<sup>23</sup>.”","[22] It is a metaphor; i.e., shows the parents the utmost humbleness like a bird lowering its wing as it hugs its young or so.\n [23] For they are at their weakest phase of life, similar to what he was in his early childhood."
  17,25,"Your Lord knows best what is in your hearts. If you are righteous, He is All-Forgiving to those who constantly turn to Him.",""
  17,26,"Give relatives their due, and the needy and the stranded travelers, and do not spend wastefully.",""
  17,27,"Indeed, the wasteful are Satans’ brothers<sup>24</sup>, and Satan is ever ungrateful to his Lord<sup>25</sup>.","[24] Islam is a religion of moderation and good consideration; neither wastefully nor stingily, but moderate.\n [25] Disbelievers are the most ungrateful ones as they rebel against Allah's commands instead of showing obedience to Him, for they follow the way of the devil towards Allah."
