quran[10]{c,v,t,f}:
  24,11,"Indeed, those who came up with the slander<sup>7</sup> are a group among you. Do not think that it is bad for you, rather it is good for you<sup>8</sup>. Each one of them is responsible for what he earned of the sin, and the one who played the major role<sup>9</sup>, for him there will be a grave punishment.","[7] It refers to the incident when the Prophet's wife ‘Ā’ishah was falsely accused by the hypocrites.\n [8] For its reward from Allah; believers being distinguished from hypocrites; and ‘Ā’ishah being absolved from false accusation, etc.\n [9] i.e., ‘Abdullah ibn ’Ubayy, leader of the hypocrites in Madinah."
  24,12,"If only the believing men and women had thought well of themselves, and said, “This is a clear slander!”",""
  24,13,"Why did they not produce four witnesses to prove it? Now, since they failed to produce witnesses, they are the liars before Allah.",""
  24,14,"Were it not for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you in this world and in the Hereafter, you would have been afflicted with a great punishment for that [lie] in which you were involved,",""
  24,15,"when you were passing it from one tongue<sup>10</sup> to the other, and saying with your mouths what you had no knowledge of, and were taking it lightly, whereas with Allah it was a grave offense.","[10] Rather than your ears, i.e., not thinking about what you hear but hastening to pass it on to others without verifying it."
  24,16,"If only you had said when you heard it, “How can we speak about such a thing! Glory be to You [O Allah]! This is a monstrous slander!”",""
  24,17,"Allah admonishes you not to repeat such a thing ever, if you are [truly] believers.",""
  24,18,"Allah makes the revelations clear to you, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",""
  24,19,"Indeed, those who like to see indecency<sup>11</sup> spread among the believers will have a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter; Allah knows and you do not know<sup>12</sup>.","[11] i.e., unlawful sexual relations.\n [12] The hidden aspects of all things: what is harmful and what is beneficial."
  24,20,"Were it not for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you, and that Allah is Ever Gracious, Most Merciful [He would have punished you].",""
