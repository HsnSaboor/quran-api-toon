  33,49,"O you who believe, when you marry believing women and then divorce them before the marriage is consummated<sup>40</sup>, you have no reason to ask them to observe any waiting period<sup>41</sup>, so give them compensation and release them in a pleasant manner.","[40] Lit., before you touch them.\n [41] After divorce a waiting period of three months is observed; however, if the marriage is not consummated, then there is no waiting period after the divorce."
  33,50,"O Prophet, We have made lawful for you<sup>42</sup> your wives whose dowries<sup>43</sup> you have paid; any bondwomen you may own from the captives whom Allah has bestowed upon you; daughters of your paternal uncle, daughters of your paternal aunts, daughters of your maternal uncle, daughters of your maternal aunts who have migrated with you; and a believing woman who offers herself to the Prophet [without dowry] if the Prophet wishes to marry her, [this is] exclusively for you, not for the rest of the believers. We know well what We have ordained for them concerning their marriages and the bondwomen they may own, so that there would be no discomfort for you. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful..","[42] As for the Muslims, see 4:3. [43] i.e., bridal gifts (mahr)."
