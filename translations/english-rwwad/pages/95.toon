quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,102,"When you [O Prophet] are with them and lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand [in prayer] with you, carrying their weapons. When they have finished their prostration, let them take their positions in the rear. Then let the other group that has not yet prayed join you in prayer, keeping vigilant and carrying their arms<sup>75</sup>. The disbelievers wish that you would neglect your weapons and belongings, so they could launch on you a surprise attack. But there is no blame on you if you lay down your weapons because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill, but take all precautions. Indeed, Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.","[75] This is the manner of prayer in danger on the battlefield."
  4,103,"When you have finished the prayer, remember Allah, standing, sitting, or lying down. But when you are safe again, establish regular prayer. Indeed, prayer is prescribed for the believers at specific times.",""
  4,104,"Do not weaken in pursuit of the enemy. If you are suffering harm, they too are suffering harm just like you; but you hope from Allah what they do not hope. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",""
  4,105,"We have sent down the Book to you [O Prophet] in truth, so that you may judge between people, in accordance with what Allah has taught you. So do not be an advocate for the deceitful.",""
