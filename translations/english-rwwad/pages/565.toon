quran[27]{c,v,t,f}:
  68,16,"We will soon brand him on the snout<sup>3</sup>.","[3] Lit., ""trunk,"" meaning the nose of an elephant or pig. These verses refer to Al-Walīd ibn al-Mughīrah, a leader of the pagans of Makkah and a staunch enemy of Islam. He called the Prophet (ﷺ) a madman, so the Qur’an responded by mentioning ten of Al-Walīd’s qualities. (See 53:33-35 and 74:11-26). Two of those qualities were not known to him: the fact that he was an illegitimate child and that his nose would be chopped off years later at the Battle of Badr. Khālid ibn al-Walīd and two of his brothers embraced Islam."
  68,17,"Indeed, We have tested them [i.e., the Makkans] as We tested the people of the garden when they swore to harvest its fruits in the early morning,",""
  68,18,"and made no exception [by saying: if Allah wills]<sup>4</sup>.","[4] Or without leaving some for the poor."
  68,19,"Then it was struck by an affliction from your Lord while they were asleep,",""
  68,20,"and it turned to ashes [as black as night].",""
  68,21,"Then in the early morning they called out to one another:",""
  68,22,"“Go early to your garden if you really wish to harvest.”",""
  68,23,"So they set out, whispering to one another,",""
  68,24,"“Not a single poor person should enter your garden today.”",""
  68,25,"And they left early, fully determined to stick to their plan<sup>5</sup>.","[5] To implement their plan, fully confident of their ability."
  68,26,"But when they saw the garden, they said, “We must have lost our way!",""
  68,27,"Rather, we have been deprived.”",""
  68,28,"The best among them said, “Did I not say to you to glorify Allah<sup>6</sup>?”","[6] i.e., remember Him by saying, ""...if Allah wills."" Or ""praise"" and ""thank"" Allah for His bounty."
  68,29,"They said, “Glory be to our Lord! We were truly wrongdoers.”",""
  68,30,"Then they turned to one another, throwing blame.",""
  68,31,"They said, “Woe to us! We were surely transgressors.",""
  68,32,"Our Lord may give us something better than this. We certainly turn to our Lord in hope<sup>7</sup>.”","[7] Of His forgiveness and bounty."
  68,33,"Such is the punishment [in this world]; but the punishment of the Hereafter is far worse, if only they knew.",""
  68,34,"Indeed, the righteous will have gardens of bliss with their Lord.",""
  68,35,"Should We then treat Muslims like the wicked?",""
  68,36,"What is the matter with you that you make such a judgment?",""
  68,37,"Or do you have a scripture in which you read",""
  68,38,"that you will be given whatever you choose?",""
  68,39,"Or do you have a solemn promise binding upon Us until the Day of Resurrection, that you will have whatever you decide for yourselves?",""
  68,40,"Ask them which of them can guarantee that.",""
  68,41,"Or do they have associate-gods? Then let them bring forth their associate-gods<sup>8</sup>, if they are truthful.","[8] whom they took as partners with Allah."
  68,42,"On the Day when the Shin [of Allah] will be uncovered<sup>9</sup>, and they are invited to prostrate, but they will not be able to do so.","[9] i.e., It is a Day that everyone will find before him great difficulty. According to a long and authentic Hadīth of Abu Sa‘īd al-Khudrī, ""the Shin"" refers to that of Allah Almighty, before which every believer will prostrate on the Day of Judgment when the disbelievers and hypocrites will not be able to prostrate. The text of the Hadith is as follows: ""... Then the Lord will uncover His Shank, so they will prostrate to Him...""."
