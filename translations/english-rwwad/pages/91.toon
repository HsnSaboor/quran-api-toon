quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,80,"Whoever obeys the Messenger has indeed obeyed Allah<sup>59</sup>. But anyone who turns away, We have not sent you [O Prophet] as a keeper over them<sup>60</sup>.","[59] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Whoever obeys me has obeyed Allah, and whoever disobeys me has disobeyed Allah”. [Al-Bukhārī: 7137, Muslim: 1835]\n [60] You are tasked only to convey the message."
  4,81,"They say, “We obey you,” but as soon as they leave you, a group of them<sup>61</sup> conspires by night against what you say. Allah records all their plots, so turn away from them, and put your trust in Allah. And sufficient is Allah as a Trustee of Affairs.","[61] i.e., the hypocrites."
  4,82,"Do they not then ponder on the Qur’an<sup>62</sup>? If it had been from anyone other than Allah, they would have surely found in it many discrepancies.","[62] i.e., its words, meanings and directives."
  4,83,"Whenever they hear any news of security or fear, they spread it<sup>63</sup>. If they referred it to the Messenger or to those in authority among them, those with sound judgment among them could know it. Were it not for Allah’s grace and mercy, you would all have followed Satan, except for a few.","[63] These hypocrites are the blabbers, a fifth column within the ranks of the believers who spread whatever news comes their way aiming to stir up unrest."
  4,84,"So fight in the way of Allah [O Prophet]; you are accountable only for yourself. But urge the believers [to fight]; perhaps Allah will restrain the might of the disbelievers, for Allah is strongest in might and severe in punishment.",""
  4,85,"Whoever intercedes in a good cause will have a share in its reward, but whoever intercedes in an evil cause will have a share in its burden<sup>64</sup>. And Allah is ever Watchful over all things.","[64] Abu Mūsa al-Ash‘arī (رضي الله عنه) said: “When a person in need came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) or when he was asked for something, he would announce: “Intercede; you will be rewarded!” [Al-Bukhārī: 1432] Yet when a person knowingly helps someone who intends evil is a partner in that misdeed and thus will reap a portion of that evil."
  4,86,"When you are given a greeting, respond with a better greeting or return the same<sup>65</sup>. Indeed, Allah is the Reckoner of all things.","[65] ‘Imrān ibn al-Husayn (رضي الله عنه) said: “A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: “Assalāmu ‘alaykum (Peace be upon you)”. He was replied to and sat down. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Ten (rewards)”. Then another one came and said: “Assalāmu ‘alaykum wa raḥmatu Allah (Peace be upon you and Allah’s Mercy)”. He was replied to and sat down. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Twenty”. Then another one came and said: “Assalāmu ‘alaykum wa raḥmatu Allah wa barakātuhu (Peace be upon you and Allah’s Mercy and His Blessings)”. He was replied to and sat down. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Thirty”. [Abū Dāwūd: 5195, At-Tirmidhī: 2689, Ahmad: 19948]"
