quran[11]{c,v,t,f}:
  47,1,"Those who disbelieve and prevent others from Allah’s way, He will render their deeds void.",""
  47,2,"As for those who believe, do righteous deeds, and believe in what has been sent down to Muhammad – which is the truth from their Lord – He will absolve them of their sins and set their condition right.",""
  47,3,"That is because the disbelievers follow falsehood, whereas the believers follow the truth from their Lord. This is how Allah explains to people their comparisons<sup>1</sup>.","[1] So that each party may know the outcome of its choice."
  47,4,"When you encounter the disbelievers [in battle], strike [their] necks until you have thoroughly subdued them, then bind the captives firmly<sup>2</sup>. Later [you may free them] as a favor<sup>3</sup> or for ransom until the war comes to an end<sup>4</sup>. That [is Our command], if Allah had willed, He could have subjected them to punishment, but [He ordered you to fight] to test some of you by means of others. Those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never render their deeds void.","[2] i.e., seize those remaining fighters as captives.\n [3] i.e., release them without taking any ransom.\n [4] lit., until the war lays down its burdens, its armor."
  47,5,"He will guide them, and will set their condition right,",""
  47,6,"and He will admit them to Paradise, which He has already made known to them<sup>5</sup>.","[5] The believers will recognize their mansions in Paradise just like they recognize their homes in the life of this world."
  47,7,"O you who believe, if you stand up for Allah, He will help you and make your steps firm<sup>6</sup>.","[6] i.e., if you stand up for Allah’s cause, His religion, and for His Prophet with your life and wealth, He will make your feet firm on the battlefield and grant you victory."
  47,8,"As for those who disbelieve, how wretched will be their state! And He will render their deeds void.",""
  47,9,"That is because they detest what Allah has sent down, so He rendered their deeds worthless.",""
  47,10,"Have they not traveled through the land to see what was the end of those before them? Allah destroyed them utterly<sup>7</sup>, and a similar end awaits the disbelievers.","[7] i.e., Allah destroyed them and all their belongings of wealth, property, and offspring."
  47,11,"That is because Allah is the Protector of the believers whereas the disbelievers have no protector.",""
