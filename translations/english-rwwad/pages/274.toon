quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  16,65,"Allah sends down rain from the sky and revives thereby the earth after its death. Indeed, there is a sign in this for people who listen<sup>40</sup>.","[40] i.e., those who listen and reflect on such evidence of Allah’s ability over the resurrection."
  16,66,"And there is surely a lesson for you in livestock. We give you drink from what is in their bellies – produced between excretion and blood – pure and pleasant milk for those who drink<sup>41</sup>.","[41] This pure, palatable and enjoyable milk, comes from between the smelly excretion and colored blood."
  16,67,"And from the fruits of palm trees and grapevines, you make intoxicants<sup>42</sup> and good provision<sup>43</sup>. Indeed, there is a sign in this for people of understanding.","[42] This is a Makkan surah that was revealed prior to the prohibition of intoxicants. [43] It alludes that there are both evil and good aspects to certain things."
  16,68,"Your Lord inspired the bees, “Make homes in the mountains, the trees, and in the trellises that people put up,",""
  16,69,"Then feed on every kind of fruit and follow the ways that your Lord made easy for you.” There comes out from their bellies a drink<sup>44</sup> of various colors, in which there is healing for people. Indeed, there is a sign in this for people who reflect.","[44] i.e., honey."
  16,70,"Allah has created you, then He causes you to die. Among you are some who are left to reach the most decrepit age<sup>45</sup>, so that they may know nothing after having known much. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, Most Capable.","[45] i.e., old age when both the physical and mental powers of a human diminish."
  16,71,"Allah has favored some of you over others in provision. Those who are favored will not share their provision with their slaves, so that they may become equal to them<sup>46</sup>. Do they then deny the favors of Allah?","[46] If they would not accept to equally share their provision with their slaves, how would then they set up associates with Allah in worship?"
  16,72,"Allah has made for you spouses of your own kind<sup>47</sup>, and has given you through your spouses children and grandchildren, and has given you provision from good things. Do they still believe in falsehood and deny the favors of Allah?","[47] i.e., humans in general, or the original creation of Eve out of Adam."
