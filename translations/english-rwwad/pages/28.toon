quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,182,"But if someone fears partiality or injustice from the testator, and puts things right between the parties, then there is no sin upon him, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  2,183,"O you who believe, fasting<sup>80</sup> is prescribed upon you as it was prescribed upon those who were before you, so that you may become righteous.","[80] To abstain from food, drink, and sexual relations from dawn to dusk."
  2,184,"[Fasting is for] a specific number of days; but if anyone of you is ill or on a journey, he should make up for those days. As for those who can only fast with hardship, compensation can be made by feeding a needy person [for each day]. But anyone who volunteers to give more, it is better for him. Yet fasting is better for you, if only you knew<sup>81</sup>.","[81] The provision of this verse has been abrogated by the next verse: 185, with few exceptions, i.e., very old person, or pregnant, etc."
  2,185,"Ramadān is a month in which the Qur’an was sent down<sup>82</sup> as a guidance for mankind and as clear signs that show the right way and distinguish between right and wrong. So whoever of you witnesses this month, should fast. But if anyone is ill or on a journey, he should make up for those days. Allah wants ease for you and does not want hardship for you, so that you may complete the prescribed number of days, and proclaim the greatness of Allah for having guided you, and so that you may be grateful.","[82] This either means that the Qur’an was sent down from the Preserved Tablet to the Lowest Heaven on the Night of Decree during the month of Ramadan, or that it was the start of the revelation to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)."
  2,186,"When My slaves ask you concerning Me, I am indeed near<sup>83</sup>. I respond to the call of the supplicant when he calls upon Me; so they should respond to Me and believe in Me, so that they may be guided.","[83] Allah’s nearness means that one does not need to raise his voice or to ask for intercession in order that his prayers be answered."
