  5,66,"If they had upheld the Torah and the Gospel, and what has been sent down to them from their Lord, they would have been given abundant provisions from above them and from below their feet. Among them are some who are on the right way, but most of them do evil deeds.",""
  5,67,"O Messenger, convey what has been sent down to you from your Lord<sup>55</sup>. If you do not do that, then you have not conveyed His message. Allah will protect you from the people. Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.","[55] ‘Ā’ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: “Whoever tells you that Muhammad (ﷺ) concealed any part of what was revealed to him (i.e., the Qur’an), then he has surely lied; when Allah says: “O Messenger, convey what has been sent down to you from your Lord…” [Al-Bukhārī: 4612]"
  5,68,"Say, “O People of the Book, you have nothing to stand on unless you observe the Torah and the Gospel and what has been sent down to you from your Lord.” Your Lord’s revelation to you [O Prophet] will only increase them in transgression and disbelief. So do not grieve over the disbelieving people.",""
  5,69,"The believers, and those who are Jews, and the Sabians and Christians [before Prophet Muhammad] – those of them who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteous deeds, they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.",""
  5,70,"We took the covenant from the Children of Israel and sent them messengers. Every time there came to them a messenger with something that did not suit their desires, they denied some of them and murdered others.",""
