quran[13]{c,v,t,f}:
  42,32,"And among His signs are the ships, sailing in the sea like mountains.",""
  42,33,"If He wills, He can still the wind, leaving the ships motionless on its surface. Indeed, there are signs in this for everyone who is steadfast and grateful.",""
  42,34,"Or He can capsize them<sup>20</sup> for what they committed, but He pardons much,","[20] i.e., He could sink the ships by violent winds."
  42,35,"then those who dispute concerning Our signs will know that they have no escape.",""
  42,36,"Whatever you have been given is but a short enjoyment of the life of this world, but what is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord;",""
  42,37,"and those who avoid major sins and shameful deeds, and when they are angered, they forgive;",""
  42,38,"and those who respond to their Lord and establish prayer, and conduct their affairs by mutual consultation, and spend out of what We have provided for them;",""
  42,39,"and those who retaliate fairly when oppressed<sup>21</sup>.","[21] Restoring their rights to preserve their honor and dignity, especially if the oppressor does not deserve remission, or it does not serve any interest."
  42,40,"The retribution of harm is its equivalent harm, but whoever pardons and seeks reconciliation, his reward is with Allah. Indeed, He does not like the wrongdoers.",""
  42,41,"But whoever retaliates after being wronged, there is no blame on them.",""
  42,42,"Blame is only on those who wrong people and transgress in the land without right. For such there will be a painful punishment.",""
  42,43,"But whoever observes patience and forgives, it is indeed a matter of great resolve<sup>22</sup>.","[22] On the part of those seeking Allah’s reward; none can be guided to this except those whom Allah blessed with great merit."
  42,44,"Whoever Allah causes to stray, he will have no protector thereafter. You will see the wrongdoers, when they see the punishment, saying, “Is there any way to go back?”",""
