quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,84,"And [remember] when We took a covenant from you that you should neither shed blood of one another, nor expel one another from your homes. Then you acknowledged it, while bearing witness to it.",""
  2,85,"Then here you are, killing one another and expelling a group of your people from their homes, aiding one another against them in sin and aggression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their expulsion was forbidden to you<sup>37</sup>. Do you then believe in part of the Scripture and deny another part? Then what is the recompense for those who do so among you except disgrace in this life, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be subjected to the severest torment? For Allah is not unaware of what you do.","[37] There were three Jewish tribes who allied themselves with the two Arab tribes of Madinah before Islam: Banū Qaynuqā‘, Banū an-Nadīr and Banū Qurayzah. In their prolonged feuds, the Jewish clans fought alongside their allies against their brethren."
  2,86,"These are the people who have purchased the life of this world for the Hereafter; their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.",""
  2,87,"We gave Moses the Scripture and sent a succession of messengers after him. We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear signs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit<sup>38</sup>. Is it that every time a messenger comes to you [O Israelites] with something against your desires, you become arrogant; some of them you rejected, and others you killed?","[38] i.e., the Angel Gabriel (عليه السلام)."
  2,88,"They say, “Our hearts are wrapped.” Nay, Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, little is it that they believe.",""
