quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  16,73,"They worship besides Allah those who have nothing to provide for them from the heavens and earth<sup>48</sup>, nor are they capable of doing so.","[48] i.e., rain from the sky or plants from the earth."
  16,74,"So do not make comparisons to Allah<sup>49</sup>. Indeed, Allah knows and you do not know<sup>50</sup>.","[49] As there is none comparable to Him. [50] Due to not realizing Allah’s Greatness and out of their ignorance, they draw comparisons between Him and their idols."
  16,75,"Allah makes a comparison of a bonded slave who has no power over anything and a [free] person whom We granted good provision from Us, and he spends from it secretly and openly. Are they equal? All praise be to Allah. But most of them do not know<sup>51</sup>.","[51] No sane person would equate the two, then how do they equate the Creator of the Possessor of the whole universe and the inanimate idols in worship?!"
  16,76,"And Allah makes a comparison of two men, one of them is dumb and unable to do anything, and he is a burden to his master; wherever he directs him, he brings no good<sup>52</sup>. Is he equal to the one who enjoins justice and follows a straight path?","[52] This is the description of their idols who are mute, deaf, mindless, and not able to do anything."
  16,77,"To Allah belongs the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and earth; and the coming of the Hour is no more than the blink of an eye or even quicker, for Allah is Most Capable of all things.",""
  16,78,"Allah brought you out from your mothers’ wombs not knowing anything, and He gave you hearing, sight and intellect, so that you may be grateful<sup>53</sup>.","[53] Men should use these faculties of hearing, sight, and intellect to ponder over their creation and know their Lord, be grateful to Him, and worship Him alone."
  16,79,"Do they not see the birds enabled to fly in the open air? None holds them up except Allah. Indeed, there are signs in this for people who believe.",""
