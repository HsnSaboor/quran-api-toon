  23,62,"We do not burden a soul more than what it can bear. We have a Record [of their deeds]<sup>28</sup> that tells the truth, and none will be wronged<sup>29</sup>.","[28] It records every word he utters and every act he does. [29] By wrongfully punishing someone or diminishing the reward of those who did good."
  23,63,"But their hearts are oblivious to this<sup>30</sup>, and they have other [evil] deeds that they are doing.","[30] They are heedless of the fact that everything they say or do is recorded in a Record, or that they are heedless of the Qur’an."

But the reward of your Lord is best<sup>33</sup>, and He is the Best of Providers.","[32] Which did not actually happen.\n [33] This was another proof of the Prophet’s prophethood, for he was conveying the message without demanding any recompense for it; rather, he staked his peaceful life and relationships with his people for accomplishing his mission."
  23,73,"Indeed, you are calling them to a straight path,",""
  23,74,"but those who do not believe in the Hereafter are deviating from that path.",""
