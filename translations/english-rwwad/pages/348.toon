quran[15]{c,v,t,f}:
  23,90,"In fact, We brought them the truth, but they are certainly liars<sup>39</sup>.","[39] For claiming that Allah has partners and offspring, and that there is no life after death."
  23,91,"Allah has never begotten a son, nor is there any god besides Him. Otherwise, each god would have taken away what he had created, and each would have tried to gain supremacy over the other<sup>40</sup>. Glory be to Allah far above what they ascribe to Him!","[40] Then there would have been serious conflicts and wars among different sovereigns and gods."
  23,92,"Knower of the unseen and the seen. Exalted is He far above what they associate with Him!",""
  23,93,"Say, “My Lord, if You show me what they<sup>41</sup> are warned of,","[41] i.e., the pagans of Makkah."
  23,94,"my Lord, then do not include me among the wrongdoing people<sup>42</sup>.”","[42] Allah’s punishment should be dreaded by all; when it comes, it does not only destroy the wicked but may also involve the righteous."
  23,95,"We are surely able to show you that of which We have warned them.",""
  23,96,"Repel evil with what is best; We know well what they claim<sup>43</sup>.","[43] That there are other gods besides Allah, and that the Prophet is a liar, a poet, etc."
  23,97,"And say, “My Lord, I seek refuge with You from the temptations of the devils.",""
  23,98,"And I seek refuge with You, my Lord, that they even come near me.”",""
  23,99,"Until when death comes to one of them, he says, “My Lord, send me back,",""
  23,100,"so that I may do righteous deeds in what I left behind.” No, it is only a word he utters. And behind them is a barrier until the Day they are resurrected<sup>44</sup>","[44] i.e., Once they die, there will be no chance of returning to the world, and they shall remain in that state until the Day of Resurrection."
  23,101,"When the Trumpet is blown<sup>45</sup>, there will be no kinship ties between them on that Day, nor will they ask about one another<sup>46</sup>.","[45] When the Trumpet is blown on the Day of Resurrection by an angel, everyone on earth will die. Then it will be blown a second time, and all will raise for Judgment. See 39:68.\n [46] For everyone will be worried and anxious about his own plight."
  23,102,"So those whose scales [of good deeds] are heavy, it is they who will be successful.",""
  23,103,"But those whose scales are light, they are the ones who have lost their souls, abiding in Hell forever.",""
  23,104,"The Fire will scorch their faces, leaving them disfigured<sup>47</sup>.","[47] Kālih means a face whose skin has been removed by scorching until the jaws are exposed."
