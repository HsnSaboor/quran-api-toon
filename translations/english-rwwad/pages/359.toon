quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  24,62,"The true believers are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger. When they are with him on a public matter, they do not leave until they ask his permission. Those who ask your permission are the ones who believe in Allah and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission for a private matter, give permission to whom you will from among them, and ask Allah’s forgiveness for them, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  24,63,"Do not consider the Messenger’s summons to you as your summons to one another<sup>37</sup>. Allah surely knows those of you who slip away hiding behind others. So let those who disobey his command beware lest some trial<sup>38</sup> may afflict them or they may be afflicted with a painful punishment.","[37] i.e., Do not call him, ‘O Muhammad.’ Rather, call him, ‘O Prophet.’\n [38] i.e., affliction, strife, dissension, etc."
  24,64,"Surely to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and earth. He knows all what you do<sup>39</sup>. On the Day they return to Him, He will inform them of what they did. And Allah is All-Knowing of everything.","[39] i.e., whether you are sincere in your faith and deeds or not."
  25,1,"Blessed is the One Who has sent down the Criterion to His slave, so that he may be a warner to the worlds<sup>1</sup>,","[1] i.e., both men and jinn."
  25,2,"He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth, Who has never begotten a son, and has no partner in His dominion. He has created everything and measured it precisely.",""
