quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,220,"in this life and the Hereafter. They ask you about orphans. Say, “Serving their interests is best. Should you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers. Allah knows who is dishonest and who is honest. If Allah had willed, He could have made things hard for you. Allah is indeed All-Mighty, All-Wise.”",""
  2,221,"Do not marry polytheist women until they believe; for a believing slave woman is better than a free polytheist, even though she may attract you. And do not give your women in marriage to polytheist men until they believe, for a believing slave is better than a free polytheist, even though he may attract you. They invite to the Fire while Allah invites to Paradise and to forgiveness by His grace, and He makes His verses clear to people so that they may take heed<sup>114</sup>.","[114] i.e., worship and obey Allah alone."
  2,222,"They ask you about menstruation. Say: “It is impurity; so stay away from women during menstruation<sup>115</sup> and do not have intercourse with them until they become pure. When they are cleansed<sup>116</sup>, then have intimacy with them as Allah has commanded you. Allah loves those who frequently repent and He loves those who purify themselves.","[115] i.e., refrain from sexual intercourse. [116] By taking a ritual bath (ghusl)."
  2,223,"Your wives are a [place of] tillage for you, so come to your tillage as you please<sup>117</sup>, and send forth something good for yourselves. Fear Allah and know that you will meet Him, and give glad tidings to the believers.”","[117] Have sexual relations with your wives in any position as long as it is in the vagina."
  2,224,"Do not use Allah’s name in your oaths as an excuse for not doing good and fearing Allah, or not making peace between people, for Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",""
