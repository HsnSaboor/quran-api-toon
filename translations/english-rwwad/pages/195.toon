  9,48,"They had surely sought to sow discord before and devised plots against you [O Prophet]<sup>46</sup> until the truth [i.e., victory] came and Allah’s decree [i.e., religion] prevailed, even though they were averse.","[46] They spared no effort to put their insidious artifice into action against the Prophet (ﷺ) and the believers."
  9,49,"There are some among them who say, “Exempt me and do not expose me to temptation.” They have already fallen into temptation<sup>47</sup>. Hell will certainly encompass the disbelievers.","[47] By avoiding their obligations, they fell into destruction."
  9,50,"If something good happens to you, it grieves them, but if a disaster befalls you, they say, “We have taken our precautions beforehand<sup>48</sup>,” and they turn away rejoicing.","[48] The hypocrites claim to have protected themselves by not setting out on the campaign."
  9,51,"Say, “Nothing will ever befall us except that which Allah has decreed for us; He is our Protector.” And in Allah alone let the believers put their trust.",""
  9,52,"Say, “Are you awaiting to befall us except one of the two fine things [i.e., victory or martyrdom]<sup>49</sup>? But we are awaiting that Allah will afflict you with punishment from Himself or at our hands. So wait; we too are waiting with you.”","[49] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “When your brothers were struck down in the Battle of Badr, Allah placed their souls in the abdominal cavities of green fowls, they drink from the rivers of Paradise, eat from its fruits and come back at the end of the day to repose in chandeliers hung in the Shadow of the Majestic Throne...” [Abū Dāwūd: 2520, Ahmad: 2388]"

  9,54,"Nothing prevents the acceptance of their spending except that they disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger, they do not come to prayer but lazily<sup>50</sup>, and they do not spend but reluctantly.","[50] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""No prayer is heavier for the hypocrites than the Fajr and the ‘Isha’ prayers; but if they knew the reward for these prayers at their respective times, they would certainly attend even if they had to crawl..."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 626]"
