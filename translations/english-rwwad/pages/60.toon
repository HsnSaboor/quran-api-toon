quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,78,"And there are some among them who alter the Scripture<sup>34</sup> with their tongues so that you may think it is part of the Scripture, while it is not part of the Scripture; and they say, “It is from Allah,” while it is not from Allah. And they tell lies about Allah knowingly.","[34] The Scripture meant here is the Torah; by distorting its words or meanings."
  3,79,"It is not for a human being whom Allah has given the Scripture, wisdom, and prophethood to say to the people, “Be my worshipers instead of Allah.” Rather, he would say, “Be devoted servants of your Lord because of your teaching of the Scripture and because of your study thereof.”",""
  3,80,"Nor would he order you to take angels and prophets as lords<sup>35</sup>. Would he order you to disbelieve after you have submitted to Allah [as Muslims]?","[35] ‘Umar (رضي الله عنه) reported: I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: ""Do not exaggerate in praising me as the Christians praised the son of Mary, for I am only a slave. So call me the slave of Allah and His Messenger."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 654]"
  3,81,"And [remember] when Allah took the covenant<sup>36</sup> of the prophets, [saying], “After I have given you the Book and wisdom, if there comes to you a messenger<sup>37</sup> confirming what is with you, then you must believe in him and support him.” Allah said, “Do you affirm this covenant and accept this commitment?” They said, “Yes, we do.” He said, “Then bear witness and I am with you among the witnesses.”","[36] It is possible that this oath was taken when the offspring of Adam were taken out of his back, or taken from each prophet at the time of his mission.\n [37] This Messenger is Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)."
  3,82,"Whoever turns away after this, it is they who are the rebellious.",""
  3,83,"Do they seek other than the religion of Allah, whereas to Him submit all those in the heavens and on earth, willingly or unwilling, and to Him they will return?",""
