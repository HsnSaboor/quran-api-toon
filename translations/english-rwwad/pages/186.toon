quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  8,70,"O Prophet, tell those captives who are in your custody, “If Allah knows of any good<sup>45</sup> in your hearts, He will give you something better than what has been taken from you, and will forgive you, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”","[45] i.e., a sincere will to embrace Islam."
  8,71,"But if they intend to betray you, they have already betrayed Allah before, so He empowered you over them. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",""
  8,72,"Those who believed, migrated, and fought with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah, and those who provided [the migrants] with shelter and help – they are allies of one another. As for those who believed but did not migrate, you have no obligation to protect them until they migrate. But if they seek your help in religion, it is your obligation to help, except against people with whom you have a treaty. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.",""
  8,73,"Those who disbelieve are protectors of one another<sup>46</sup>. Unless you do likewise, there will be persecution in the land and great corruption.","[46] i.e., taking one another as allies and abandoning all bonds with the disbelievers."
  8,74,"Those who believed, migrated and fought in the cause of Allah, as well as those who gave them refuge and help – it is they who are the true believers; they will have forgiveness and an honorable provision.",""
  8,75,"And those who believed afterwards, migrated and fought along with you – they belong to you. But blood relatives are more entitled to inherit<sup>47</sup> from one another according to the Book of Allah. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of everything.","[47] This applies only to Muslim relatives; others may be given by bequest. See 4:11."
