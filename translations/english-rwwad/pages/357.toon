quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  24,54,"Say, “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. But if you turn away, he is only responsible for his duty<sup>31</sup> and you are responsible for your duty<sup>32</sup>. If you obey him, you will be guided. The duty of the Messenger is only to convey the message clearly.”","[31] The Prophet’s duty is only to convey the message.\n [32] Their duty is to obey the Prophet (ﷺ) and submit to the will of Allah."
  24,55,"Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous deeds that He will make them successors in the land, as He made those who came before them, and He will surely establish for them their religion which He has chosen for them, and He will surely change their state of fear into security; that they worship Me, not associating anything with Me. But whoever disbelieves<sup>33</sup> after that, it is they who are the rebellious.","[33] i.e., denies Allah's favor or does not live by His ordinance."

  24,58,"O you who believe, let your slaves and those among you who have not reached puberty ask for your permission [to enter] at three times: before dawn prayer, when you take off your outer garments at noon, and after the night prayer; three times of privacy<sup>34</sup> for you. Beyond that there is no blame on you nor on them to move about freely, attending to one another. This is how Allah makes the verses clear to you, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.","[34] ‘Awrāt: (sing. ‘Awrah) lit., ""exposure"" or ""being uncovered."""
