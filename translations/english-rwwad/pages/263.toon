  15,20,"And We have made therein for you means of sustenance and for those<sup>8</sup> whom you do not provide.","[8] i.e., the children, servants, and livestock that one is blessed with."
  15,21,"There is nothing except that We have its treasuries, and We do not send it down except in a determined measure.",""
  15,22,"And We send fertilizing winds<sup>9</sup>, and send down rain from the sky for you to drink, and it is not you who could store it.","[9] Causing precipitation in rainclouds or carrying pollen."

  15,27,"And the jinn<sup>11</sup> We created before that, from smokeless fire.","[11] The jinn: They are the creatures of Allah, who are different from humans. There are some among them who are righteous, while others are wicked. They are not humans or a species of humans."

  15,31,"except for Iblīs, who refused to be with those who prostrated<sup>13</sup>.","[13] See 18:50."
