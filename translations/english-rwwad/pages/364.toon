  25,44,"Do you think that most of them hear or understand?<sup>22</sup> They are just like cattle<sup>23</sup>, rather they are further astray from the right way.","[22] They follow others blindly.\n [23] i.e., like livestock or sheep, that follow without asking wherever they are led."
  25,45,"Do you not see how your Lord extends the shade? If He had willed, He could have made it still. Then We made the sun an indication of it<sup>24</sup>.","[24] i.e., indication for its existence or making it apparent."
  25,46,"Then We gradually draw it towards Us [i.e., Then the sun climbs up]?",""
  25,47,"It is He Who has made the night as a garment<sup>25</sup> for you, and made sleep for rest; and has made daytime for returning to life<sup>26</sup>.","[25] It covers you in darkness and provides rest.\n [26] To return to your livelihood and activity."
  25,48,"It is He Who sends the winds as harbingers before His mercy, and We send down from the sky pure water,",""
  25,49,"so that We may revive therewith a dead land, and quench the thirst of countless beasts and humans We have created.",""
  25,50,"We distribute it among them so that they may take heed<sup>27</sup>, but most people persist in their ingratitude.","[27] Such as Allah’s ability to bring the dead to life."

  25,53,"It is He Who merges the two bodies of water: one fresh and palatable and the other salty and bitter, and He has made between them a barrier and an insurmountable partition<sup>29</sup>.","[29] When salt and fresh waters meet, although both mix together, each still keeps its distinctive qualities, as if a barrier prevents them from mixing completely."
  25,54,"It is He Who created human beings from water<sup>30</sup>, then made between them bonds of kinship and marriage, for your Lord is Most Capable.","[30] i.e., the zygote (the mixture of sperm and egg)."
