quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  8,17,"It was not you who killed them, but it was Allah Who killed them; and it was not you [O Prophet] who threw when you threw [a handful of sand]<sup>8</sup> but it was Allah Who threw, so that He might test the believers with a great test. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.","[8] It filled their eyes and noses, preventing their advance."
  8,18,"As such, Allah undermines the plans of the disbelievers.",""
  8,19,"If you [disbelievers] were seeking the decision, it has come to you<sup>9</sup>. If you desist, it will be better for you, but if you return [to war], We too will return. And your forces – no matter how great in number they are – will not avail you anything, for Allah is with the believers.","[9] The disbelievers implored Allah against Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) and Muslims (alleging that they were wrongdoers), so His decision came."
  8,20,"O you who believe, obey Allah and His Messenger, and do not turn away from him after hearing [his command].",""
  8,21,"And do not be like those<sup>10</sup> who say, “We hear,” while they do not actually listen.","[10] i.e., the hypocrites and/or the disbelievers."
  8,22,"The worst of creatures before Allah are those who are deaf and dumb, and who do not understand.",""
  8,23,"If Allah had known any good in them<sup>11</sup>, He would have made them hear, but even if He had made them hear, they would have turned away in aversion.","[11] i.e., real willingness and intention of good."
  8,24,"O you who believe, respond to Allah and the Messenger when He calls you to what gives you life<sup>12</sup>, and know that Allah comes between a person and his heart<sup>13</sup>, and it is to Him that you will all be gathered.","[12] A better life with faith both in this life and in the Hereafter.\n [13] Beware of rejecting the command of Allah when it comes to you, for Allah may not enable you to respond to his command afterward, as the hearts are between the two Fingers of Allah Who changes it as He wishes."
  8,25,"Beware of a trial that will not only befall the wrongdoers among you, and know that Allah is severe in punishment.",""
