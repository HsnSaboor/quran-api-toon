quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,1,"O people, fear your Lord Who created you from a single soul, and created from it its mate<sup>1</sup>, and from both of them created countless men and women. Fear Allah in Whose name you ask one another, and be mindful of your kinship ties<sup>2</sup>, for Allah is ever Watchful over you.","[1] Adam, the single soul, and Eve its mate.\n [2] People’s rights, especially those of kith and kin, are to be honored as much as Allah’s own rights."
  4,2,"Give orphans their wealth, and do not exchange your bad possessions for their good ones, nor consume their wealth by mixing it with your own; for this is indeed a great sin.",""
  4,3,"If you fear that you may not maintain justice with orphan girls [by marrying them] then marry women of your choice—two, three, or four<sup>3</sup>; but if you fear that you may not maintain justice, then marry only one, or slave-girls you may own. That is more likely to avoid committing injustice.","[3] ‘Ā’ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: “This verse was revealed concerning any man under whom is an orphan girl for whom he is both guardian and inheritor, while she has money and with no one to argue in her favor. This guardian is enjoined not to marry her for her money, nor is he to beat or molest her in the process. In this respect, Allah says: “If you fear that you may not maintain justice with orphan girls [by marrying them] then marry women of your choice”. That is, He, the Almighty, is saying: “These I made lawful for you, and leave out those that you may be unfair to.”” [Al-Bukhārī: 4573, Muslim: 3018]"
  4,4,"Give women their marriage dowries<sup>4</sup> graciously. However, if they waive to you part of it willingly, then enjoy it with a clear conscience.","[4] The obligatory bridal gift (mahr)."
  4,5,"Do not give the feeble-minded your property, which Allah has made a means of livelihood for you, but feed and clothe them from it, and speak to them kindly.",""
  4,6,"Test the orphans until they reach a marriageable age. Then if you perceive maturity in them, hand over their property to them<sup>5</sup>, and do not consume it extravagantly and hastily, lest they should grow up. If the guardian is well-off, he should restrain himself entirely; but if he is poor, he may take a reasonable provision. When you hand over their property to them, call in witnesses. And Allah is sufficient as a Reckoner.","[5] Test those orphans over whom you are guardian so as to make sure that they are discerning enough to be given their money and will not squander it due to lack of mental maturity."
