quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  33,1,"O Prophet, fear Allah and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",""
  33,2,"Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord. Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of what you do.",""
  33,3,"Put your trust in Allah; sufficient is Allah as a Disposer of Affairs.",""
  33,4,"Allah has not made for any man two hearts inside him, nor has he made your wives – whom you declare unlawful – your real mothers<sup>1</sup>, nor has he made your adopted sons your real sons<sup>2</sup>. These are only words that you utter, but Allah speaks the truth and He guides to the right way.","[1] This type of divorce is called zihār: a common practice in Arabia before the Prophet (ﷺ). If someone declared his wife as unlawful for him as the zahr (back) of his mother is unlawful for him, his wife would be divorced. Islam abolished this divorce. Allah says: “As for those among you who divorce their wives by likening them to their mothers, they are not their mothers; their mothers are none but those who gave birth to them.” See 58:2.\n [2] Adoption of a child or an orphan is not permissible by ascribing the child to other than their real parents. Whereas, it is permissible for one to sponsor a child or host them in their home and care for them as they care for their own children, except for legal matters."
  33,5,"Call these [adopted sons] by their fathers’ names; that is more equitable before Allah. But if you do not know their fathers, then they are your brothers in faith and your patronized associates. There is no blame on you if you make a mistake in that regard, but only for what your hearts intend. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  33,6,"The Prophet has a greater claim over the believers than their own selves<sup>3</sup>, and his wives are their mothers. And blood relatives are more entitled [to inheritance] than other believers and emigrants according to the Book of Allah unless you do good to your close associates [through bequest]<sup>4</sup>. This is written in the Record<sup>5</sup>.","[3] He (ﷺ) is more worthy of their obedience and loyalty.\n [4] A previous ruling that allowed inheritance between Muslims, especially between the Emigrants and the Helpers, was abrogated. Only relatives can inherit from one another now, whereas non-heirs can have a share through a bequest of a deceased, up to one-third of the estate. See 4:7, 11-13, 32-33, 176, 8:75.\n [5] i.e., the Preserved Tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfūz)."
