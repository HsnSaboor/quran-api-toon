quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,38,"And [also] those who spend their wealth to show off to people, but do not believe in Allah or the Last Day. Whoever<sup>28</sup> takes Satan as an associate has indeed taken an evil associate.","[28] They are the companions of Satan, who enjoins ungodly acts and drives them away from acts of virtue."
  4,39,"What harm would it do to them to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and spend out of what Allah has provided for them? For Allah is All-Knowing of them.",""
  4,40,"Allah does not do injustice as much as an atom’s weight<sup>29</sup>. And if it is a good deed, He will multiply it and give from Himself a great reward.","[29] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “None who bears the weight of a mustard seed of faith in his heart will enter Hell”. [Muslim: 91]"
  4,41,"How will it be when We bring a witness from every community, and bring you [O Prophet] as a witness against these [people]?",""
  4,42,"On that Day, those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth were leveled upon them. And they will not be able to hide anything from Allah<sup>30</sup>.","[30] Because they know that they will be held accountable for all their past deeds and they can say nothing but the truth on that Day."
  4,43,"O you who believe, do not approach the prayer while you are intoxicated<sup>31</sup> until you know what you are saying, nor in a state of major impurity – except while passing through [a mosque] – until you take a bath. If you are ill, or on a journey, or have relieved yourselves, or had intercourse with [your] women and find no water, then purify yourselves with clean earth and wipe your faces and hands with it. For Allah is Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving.","[31] The use of intoxicants was later prohibited completely. See 5:90-91."
  4,44,"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book – purchasing misguidance and wishing that you lose your way?",""
