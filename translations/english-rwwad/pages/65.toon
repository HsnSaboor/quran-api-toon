quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,116,"Those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children will ever avail them against Allah; they are the people of the Fire, they will abide therein forever.",""
  3,117,"The similitude of what they spend in the life of this world is like that of a frosty wind that strikes and destroys the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves. It is not Allah Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves.",""
  3,118,"O you who believe, do not take as close friends those from other than yourselves; they spare no effort to ruin you; they wish to see you suffer. Hatred has appeared from their mouths<sup>55</sup>, but what their hearts conceal is even greater. We have made the verses clear to you, if only you understand.","[55] No matter how hard they try to keep their real feelings secret, their tongues expose their inner feelings."
  3,119,"O you [believers], you are those who love them but they do not love you, even though you believe in all the Scriptures<sup>56</sup>. When they meet you, they say, “We believe,” but when they are alone, they bite their fingertips against you in rage. Say, “May you die in your rage.” Allah is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts.","[56] All divine Books revealed by Allah."
  3,120,"If something good happens to you, it grieves them; but if adversity befalls you, they rejoice at it. But if you keep patient and fear Allah, their schemes will not harm you in the least; for Allah encompasses all what they do.",""
  3,121,"And [remember] when you left your home in the morning to position the believers for the battle [of ’Uhud]; and Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",""
