  28,22,"When he headed towards Midian, he said, “My Lord will surely guide me to a straight way.”",""
  28,23,"When he arrived at the well of Midian, he found a crowd of people watering [their flocks] and found apart from them two women holding [their flocks] back. He said, “What is the matter with you?” They said, “We cannot water [them] until the shepherds take [their flocks] away, and our father is a very old man.”",""
  28,24,"So he watered [their flocks] for them, then he turned to the shade and said, “My Lord, I am desperately in need of whatever good You may send down to me<sup>11</sup>.”","[11] Moses left Egypt having nothing until he arrived in Midian.

  28,25,"Then one of the two women came to him, walking modestly. She said, “My father<sup>12</sup> is inviting you so that he may reward you for watering [our flocks] for us.” When he came to him and told him the whole story, he said, “Have no fear. You are now safe from the wrongdoing people.”","[12] Prophet Shu‘ayb, the father of the two women."

  28,28,"Moses said, “Let that be the agreement between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I complete, there will be no further obligation on me, and Allah is Witness over what we say.”",""
