quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  11,29,"O my people, I do not ask you for any wealth in return for it; my reward is only with Allah. I will not dismiss those who believe<sup>15</sup>; they will surely meet their Lord, but I see that you are ignorant people.","[15] The upper echelons of society, out of sheer egotism, despised the underprivileged believers and asked Prophet Noah (عليه السلام) to dismiss them, as happened with Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) too."
  11,30,"O my people, who would protect me from Allah if I were to dismiss them? Will you not then take heed?",""
  11,31,"I do not tell you that I have Allah’s treasures or that I know the unseen, nor do I say that I am an angel. Nor do I say about those whom you look down upon, that Allah will never grant them any good, for Allah knows best what is in their hearts. If I did so, I would surely be one of the wrongdoers.”",""
  11,32,"They said, “O Noah, you have argued far too much with us, so bring what you are threatening us with, if you are one of the truthful.”",""
  11,33,"He said, “It is only Allah Who can bring it upon you if He wills, then you will have no escape.",""
  11,34,"Nor will my advice benefit you – no matter how hard I try – if Allah wills to leave you astray. He is your Lord, and to Him you will be returned.”",""
  11,35,"Or do they say that he has fabricated it”? Say [O Prophet], “If I did fabricate it, then I am responsible for my sin, but I am innocent of the sins you commit.”",""
  11,36,"It was revealed to Noah, “None of your people will ever believe except those who have already believed. So do not grieve over what they do<sup>16</sup>.","[16] i.e., rejecting the message and mockery."
  11,37,"Construct the Ark under Our [watchful] Eyes<sup>17</sup> and Our direction, and do not plead with Me for those who did wrong, for they will surely be drowned.”","[17] Being seen, cared for and protected by Allah Almighty."
