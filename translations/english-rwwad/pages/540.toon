quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  57,19,"Those who believe in Allah and His messengers, it is they who are the people of the truth. And the martyrs will have their reward and their light with their Lord. As for those who disbelieve and reject Our verses, they are the people of the Blazing Fire.",""
  57,20,"Know that the life of this world is no more than play, amusement, adornment, boasting among yourselves, and competition in wealth and children. It is like plants that flourish after rain, pleasing the sowers, then they wither and you see them turning yellow, and then they crumble. And in the Hereafter there will be severe punishment, or forgiveness from Allah and His pleasure. For the life of this world is no more than a fleeting enjoyment.",""
  57,21,"Race one another towards forgiveness from your Lord and Paradise the width of which is like the width of the heaven and earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His messengers. That is the bounty of Allah which He gives to whom He wills, for Allah is the Lord of great bounty.",""
  57,22,"No calamity befalls the earth or yourselves but it is already written in a Record<sup>16</sup> before We bring it into existence. That is indeed easy for Allah –","[16] i.e., the Preserved Tablet."
  57,23,"so that you may not grieve over what you have missed, nor exult over what He has given you, for Allah does not love anyone who is conceited and boastful –",""
  57,24,"those who are stingy and promote stinginess among people. And those who turn away<sup>17</sup>, then Allah is the Self-Sufficient, the Praiseworthy.","[17] Refuse to spend in the way of Allah or refuse obedience to Him."
