quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,10,"Those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children will avail them at all against Allah; it is they who are the fuel of the Fire.",""
  3,11,"[Their] case is like that of the people of Pharaoh and those before them. They all rejected Our signs, so Allah seized them for their sins, for Allah is severe in punishment.",""
  3,12,"Say to those who disbelieve: “You will soon be defeated and gathered into Hell. What a terrible resting place!”",""
  3,13,"There has been a sign for you in the two groups who confronted each other: one fighting for the cause of Allah, and the other disbelievers; they saw them, with their own eyes twice their number<sup>7</sup>. But Allah strengthens with His help whom He wills. There is a lesson in this for those who have insight.","[7] The believers saw the disbelievers to be double their own number preceding the battle of Badr, while, in fact, they were three times their number."
  3,14,"The love of desirable things has been made appealing to people, such as women, children, hoarded heaps of gold and silver, branded fine horses, livestock, and tilled land. These are the pleasures of the life of this world, but with Allah is the best place of return.",""
  3,15,"Say, “Shall I inform you of what is better than these? For those who fear Allah are gardens with their Lord under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever, with pure<sup>8</sup> spouses and pleasure from Allah. And Allah is All-Seeing of His slaves,","[8] i.e., they will have no menses, urine, or stool."
