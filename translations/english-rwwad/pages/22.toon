quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,142,"The foolish among the people will say: “What has turned them away from their prayer direction they used to face<sup>61</sup>?” Say: “To Allah belong the east and west: He guides whom He wills to a straight path.”","[61] Prior to the command (in verse 144) that the Prophet (ﷺ) and his followers turn toward the Ka‘bah in Makkah for prayer, they had been facing Jerusalem to the north. Further details are mentioned in succeeding verses."
  2,143,"Thus We made you a balanced nation, so that you may be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger a witness over you. We did not change your former direction of prayer [to the Ka‘bah] except to distinguish those who would follow the Messenger from those who would turn back on their heels. It was surely burdensome except for those whom Allah guided. Allah would never let your [acts of] faith go to waste, for Allah is Most Gracious and Most Merciful to all people.",""
  2,144,"We see the turning of your face [O Prophet] towards heaven<sup>62</sup>; We will surely make you turn towards a prayer direction that will please you. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque [in Makkah], and wherever you are, turn your faces towards it. Those who were given the Scripture know that this is the truth from their Lord, and Allah is not unaware of what they do.","[62] The Prophet (ﷺ) was awaiting the command to change the qiblah; so he used to look up at the sky."
  2,145,"Even if you were to bring every proof to those who have been given the Scripture, they would not follow your prayer direction, nor would you follow their prayer direction; nor would any of them follow the prayer direction of the other. However, if you were to follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, then you would surely be among the wrongdoers.",""
