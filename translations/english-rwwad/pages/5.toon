  2,25,"And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens under which rivers flow. Every time they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” for they will be given fruit that resemble one another. They will have purified spouses, and they will abide therein forever.",""
  2,26,"Allah is not ashamed to give a similitude of a mosquito or even something less [significant]<sup>16</sup>. As for those who believe, they know that this is the truth from their Lord; but those who disbelieve say, “What does Allah mean by this similitude?” He causes many to go astray thereby and guides many thereby, but He causes none to go astray except the evildoers –","[16] Lit., ""above it"" i.e., greater in smallness."
  2,27,"those who break the covenant of Allah after it has been ratified, sever bonds that Allah has commanded to be maintained<sup>17</sup>, and spread corruption in the land. It is they who are the losers.","[17] By keeping good relations with kith and kin."

  2,29,"It is He Who created for you all that is in the earth, then He turned towards the heaven and made them seven heavens, and He is All-Knowing of everything.",""
