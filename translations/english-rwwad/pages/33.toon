quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,211,"Ask the Children of Israel how many clear signs We have given them. But anyone who substitutes the favors of Allah [for disbelief] after receiving it, then Allah is severe in punishment.",""
  2,212,"The life of this world is made appealing to those who disbelieve, and they ridicule the believers, while those who fear Allah will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah provides to whom He wills without measure.",""
  2,213,"Mankind was just one nation. Then Allah sent prophets with glad tidings and warnings<sup>107</sup>, and sent down to them the Scriptures in truth, to judge between people in matters over which they disputed. But none disputed thereafter except out of arrogance after they had received the clear proofs<sup>108</sup>. Then Allah, by His grace, guided those who believed to the truth in which they disputed. For Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path.","[107] Ibn ‘Abbās (رضي الله عنهما) reported: “The time between Adam and Noah was ten centuries. People were on the right path, but then they started disputing over matters of faith. So, Allah sent prophets bearing glad tiding and warning”. ­[Al-Mustadrak of Al-Hākim].\n [108] The plight of humans, especially those who lack sincerity and humbleness, is such that the more knowledge they possess, the more haughty and disputatious they become."
  2,214,"Do you think that you will enter Paradise without being tested like those before you who were tested? They were afflicted with poverty and adversity and were shaken<sup>109</sup> until the messenger<sup>110</sup> and the believers with him said, “When will the help of Allah come?” Indeed, the victory of Allah is near.","[109] The road to Paradise is not paved with roses; it can only be reached through hardship.\n [110] Any of the previous Prophets."
  2,215,"They ask you what they should spend. Say, “Whatever good you spend should be for parents, relatives, orphans and the needy, and the wayfarer; and whatever good you do, Allah is All-Knowing of it.”",""
