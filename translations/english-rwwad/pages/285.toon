quran[11]{c,v,t,f}:
  17,28,"But if you must turn away from [those in need] while hoping to receive bounty from your Lord<sup>26</sup>, then say to them words of comfort.","[26] i.e., if you have nothing to give them now."
  17,29,"Do not be too tight-fisted<sup>27</sup>, nor too open-handed<sup>28</sup>, for you will end up blameworthy and destitute.","[27] i.e., stingy. [28] i.e., extravagant."
  17,30,"Your Lord extends provision to whom He wills or restricts it<sup>29</sup>. He is All-Aware and All-Seeing of His slaves.","[29] He gives or withholds wealth according to what is best for the person concerned and what they would do with it if he is provided with it."
  17,31,"Do not kill your children for fear of poverty<sup>30</sup>, for We provide for them and for you. Indeed, killing them is a great sin.","[30] Abdullāh ibn Mas‘ūd (رضي الله عنه) reported: “I said: “O Messenger of Allah, what is the greatest sin?” He said: “That you set up rivals with Allah, when He is the One Who created you!” Then I said: “What is next?” He said: “That you kill your child because he eats with you!” [Al-Bukhāri: 6811]."
  17,32,"Do not go near adultery<sup>31</sup>, for it is indeed a shameful act and an evil way.","[31] i.e., avoid all things that might lead to it."
  17,33,"Do not kill any soul that Allah has forbidden, except in the course of justice. If anyone is killed wrongfully, We have given his heir authority [of compensation], but he should not exceed the bounds in killing, for he is already supported [by law].",""
  17,34,"Do not approach the property of an orphan except with good [intent]<sup>32</sup>, until he reaches maturity; and fulfill the covenant, for you will certainly be questioned about the covenant.","[32] i.e., to improve, increase, or preserve it."
  17,35,"Give full measure when you measure, and weigh with accurate scales; that is fair and best in the end<sup>33</sup>.","[33] Fair dealing is best, for it brings blessing, psychological calm, and reward in the Hereafter."
  17,36,"Do not follow<sup>34</sup> that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight, and the heart, all of them will be called to account.","[34] i.e., do not say or assume."
  17,37,"Do not walk on the earth arrogantly; you cannot cleave the earth, nor can you reach the mountains in height<sup>35</sup>.","[35] Man is indeed a weak and small creature, then why arrogance?!"
  17,38,"The evil of all these actions is hateful to your Lord.",""
