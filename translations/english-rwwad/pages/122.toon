However, if someone cannot afford it, then he must fast for three days. That is the expiation for breaking your oaths. But be mindful of your oaths<sup>64</sup>. This is how Allah makes His verses clear to you, so that you may be grateful.","[63] i.e., out of habit or without true intent.\n [64] i.e., do not swear much; do not swear while lying; honor your oaths."
