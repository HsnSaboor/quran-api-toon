quran[3]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,12,"Your share is half of your wives’ estate if they leave no child; but if they leave a child, you get one-fourth, after settling the bequests or debts. Your wives’ share is one-fourth of your estate if you leave no child, but if you leave a child, they get one-eighth, after settling the bequests or debts. If a man or a woman leaves neither parents nor offspring<sup>10</sup>, but has a brother or a sister, each one gets one-sixth<sup>11</sup>; but if they are more than two, they share in one-third, after settling the bequests or debts, without causing harm to the heirs. This is an instruction from Allah; and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.","[10] Kalālah: A person who has no living children or parents; (from iklīl), wreath, as his brothers and sisters surround him like a wreath surrounds the head.\n [11] These shares are divided equally between males and females."
  4,13,"These are the limits [set by] Allah. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him to gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. That is the supreme triumph.",""
  4,14,"But whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His limits, He will cause him to enter the Fire, abiding therein forever, and for him there will be a humiliating punishment.",""
