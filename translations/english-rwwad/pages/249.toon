quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  13,1,"Alif Lām Mīm Ra<sup>1</sup>. These are the verses of the Book. That which has been sent down to you [O Prophet] from your Lord is the truth, but most people do not believe.","[1] See footnote 2:1."
  13,2,"It is Allah Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see, and then He rose over the Throne<sup>2</sup>. He subjected the sun and the moon, each running its course for an appointed term. He governs all affairs, and explains the signs in detail, so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.","[2] See footnote 7:54."
  13,3,"It is He Who spread out the earth and placed therein firm mountains and rivers, and created therein fruits of every kind in pairs. He causes the night to cover the day. Indeed, there are signs in this for people who reflect.",""
  13,4,"And on the earth there are neighboring [yet different] tracts of land, and gardens of grapevines, grains and palm trees – some growing in clusters from one root or standing alone. They are all irrigated with the same water, yet We cause some of them to excel others in taste. Indeed, there are signs in this for people of understanding.",""
  13,5,"If you wonder, then wondrous is their saying, “What! When we become dust, will we be created anew?” They are the ones who disbelieve in their Lord, and they are the ones who will have shackles around their necks. Such are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.",""
