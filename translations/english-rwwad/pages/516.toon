quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  49,5,"If they had been patient until you came out to them, it would have been better for them. But Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  49,6,"O you who believe, if an evildoer brings you some news, verify it, lest you harm a people unknowingly, then you become regretful for what you did<sup>4</sup>.","[4] The Prophet (ﷺ) sent Al-Walīd ibn ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu‘ait to collect zakah (alms-tax) from the tribe of Bani Al-Mustaliq. They went out to receive Al-Walīd but he thought that they wanted to harm him. So, he quickly came back to the Prophet (ﷺ) with the bad news, so he wanted to punish them. After a while, a delegation from Bani Al-Mustaliq came to clear the misunderstanding."
  49,7,"Know that the Messenger of Allah is among you. If he were to obey you in many matters, you would surely suffer<sup>5</sup>. But Allah has endeared faith to you and made it pleasing to your hearts, and has made disbelief, wickedness, and disobedience hateful to you. Such are the rightly guided,","[5] Things would be difficult for you."
  49,8,"by Allah’s grace and favor. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",""
  49,9,"If two groups of the believers fight one another, make peace between them. If one of them transgresses against the other, fight against the transgressing group until they submit to the rule of Allah. Then if they submit, make peace between them with fairness, and be just, for Allah loves those who are just.",""
  49,10,"The believers are but brothers, so make peace between your brothers. And fear Allah, so that you may be shown mercy.",""
  49,11,"O you who believe, let not some men ridicule others, for it may be that they are better than them; nor let some women ridicule others, for it may be that they are better than them. Do not speak ill of one another, nor call one another by [offensive] nicknames. How evil is the name of wickedness after having faith! And whoever does not repent, it is they who are the wrongdoers.",""
