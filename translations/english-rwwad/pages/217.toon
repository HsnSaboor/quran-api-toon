quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  10,71,"Relate to them the story of Noah when he said to his people, “O my People, if my presence among you and my reminding you of Allah’s signs have become unbearable to you, then in Allah I have put my trust. So gather all your schemes, you and your [so-called] partners, leaving no room for uncertainty, then carry it out against me, and give me no respite<sup>53</sup>.","[53] Prophet Noah’s (عليه السلام) mission lasted for 950 long years of argumentation with his people and is described in much detail in the Qur’an: “They said: “O Noah, you have argued with us and argued much, so bring us what you have promised us if you are telling the truth!” (11:32); “They said: “If you cease not, O Noah, you will indeed be among the stoned!” (26:116). He finally challenged them in a manner fully trusting in Allah that no one could cause him harm unless Allah willed it so."
  10,72,"But if you turn away, then I have not asked you for any reward. My reward is only with Allah, and I have been commanded to be among those who submit to Allah [as Muslims].”",""
  10,73,"But they rejected him, so We saved him and those who were with him in the Ark, and made them successors<sup>54</sup>, and We drowned those who rejected Our signs. Then see how was the end of those who were warned.","[54] Allah Almighty made the people who followed Noah the ones whose posterity was to last in the land."
  10,74,"Then We sent after him messengers to their [own] peoples; they came to them with clear proofs, but they would not believe in what they had already rejected beforehand<sup>55</sup>. This is how We seal the hearts of the transgressors.","[55] i.e., the succeeding generations were persistent in disbelief."
  10,75,"Then We sent after them Moses and Aaron with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they showed arrogance and were wicked people.",""
  10,76,"So when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “This is indeed a clear magic!”",""
  10,77,"Moses said, “Do you say this about the truth after it has come to you? Can this be magic? But magicians will never succeed.”",""
  10,78,"They said, “Have you come to turn us away from what we found our forefathers following, so that you two might become supreme in the land? We will never believe in you<sup>56</sup>!”","[56] “They said: “No matter what sign you may bring to enchant us, we are not going to believe in you.” See 7:132."
