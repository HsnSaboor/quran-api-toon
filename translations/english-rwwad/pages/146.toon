quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,138,"They say, “These livestock and crops are reserved, none may eat them except those<sup>46</sup> whom we wish,” – as they claim – and there are livestock whose backs are forbidden [from labor]<sup>47</sup>, and livestock over whom they do not mention the name of Allah [while slaughtering] – fabricating lies against Him<sup>48</sup>. He will punish them for their lies.","[46] i.e., the servants of idols and others.\n [47] The four categories of grazing livestock were dedicated to their idols and false deities, and they were forbidden from riding and labor. See 5:103.\n [48] i.e., false claims that these practices are part of Allah’s religion."
  6,139,"They also say, “What is in the bellies of these livestock<sup>49</sup> is exclusively for our males and forbidden to our females, but if it is stillborn, they all will have a share in it. He will punish them for what they attribute<sup>50</sup>. He is All-Wise, All-Knowing.","[49] i.e., their milk and offspring.\n [50] i.e., for making things lawful and unlawful as they wish."
  6,140,"Losers indeed are those who kill their children foolishly out of ignorance and prohibit what Allah has provided for them – fabricating lies against Him. They have gone astray and are not guided.",""
  6,141,"It is He Who brings into being gardens – trellised and untrellised – and palm trees and crops of different flavors, and olives and pomegranates – similar [in shape] yet different [in taste]. Eat of their fruit when they bear fruit and give out its due on the day of harvest. But do not be wasteful, for He does not like those who are wasteful.",""
  6,142,"Among livestock are some that carry loads and others not. Eat of what Allah has provided for you, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan<sup>51</sup>, for He is your sworn enemy.","[51] By falsely making some provisions lawful and others unlawful."
