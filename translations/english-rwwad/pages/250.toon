quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  13,6,"They ask you [O Prophet] to hasten the punishment before the good<sup>3</sup>, even though there have already been similar punishments before them. But your Lord is indeed forgiving to people despite their wrongdoing, and your Lord is indeed severe in punishment.","[3] This shows the utter disregard towards the Message."
  13,7,"The disbelievers say, “Why has no sign<sup>4</sup> been sent down to him from his Lord?” You are only a warner, and for every people there is a guide.","[4] i.e., a miracle."
  13,8,"Allah knows what every female bears<sup>5</sup>, and what the wombs may fall short or increase<sup>6</sup>. With Him everything is precisely measured.","[5] Human and otherwise, during pregnancy.\n [6] Decrease and increase in the duration of pregnancy and/or the number of fetuses therein."
  13,9,"He is the Knower of the unseen and the seen, the All-Great, the Most Exalted.",""
  13,10,"It is the same [to Him] whether one of you speaks secretly or in public, and whether one is hidden in the darkness of the night or walks about openly in the daylight.",""
  13,11,"For each person there are successive angels<sup>7</sup> in front of him and behind him, guarding him by the command of Allah. Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change their own attitude and conduct<sup>8</sup>. But if Allah intends punishment for a people<sup>9</sup>, then it cannot be averted, nor will there be any protector for them besides Him.","[7] Angels tasked with each human; they alternate and take day and night shifts.\n [8] As long as people acknowledge Allah’s grace on them and are grateful to Him, He will not show them other than mercy, and vice versa. If they persist in disobedience, then let them not be fooled by the respite they are given, for Allah’s command can come at any moment.\n [9] Because of their sins."
  13,12,"It is He Who shows you lightening [causing] fear and hope<sup>10</sup> and forms heavy clouds<sup>11</sup>.","[10] “Fear” of being hit by thunderbolt and “hope” for getting rain.\n [11] The fluffy clouds floating above our heads like balloons are in fact extremely heavy."
  13,13,"The thunder glorifies His praise, and so do the angels in awe of Him. He sends thunderbolts, striking therewith whom He wills, yet they dispute about Allah, Who is severe in might.",""
