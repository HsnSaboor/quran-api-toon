quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  59,4,"That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger. And whoever opposes Allah, Allah is truly severe in punishment.",""
  59,5,"Whatever palm trees you cut down<sup>4</sup> or left standing on their trunks<sup>5</sup>, it was by Allah’s Will, so that He might disgrace the evildoers<sup>6</sup>.","[4] To enrage the enemies of Allah.\n [5] To benefit from them.\n [6] When the Muslim army was about to enter the fort of Banū Nadīr, they cut down some of their palm trees, so the Jews were terrified and alleged that this was corruption. So the Muslims disagreed about it; some of them said not to cut the trees, for these are gains that Allah has bestowed upon us, while some others said that we cut them off to enrage them. Hence, this verse was revealed to appease both parties of the Muslims, proclaiming that all this happened by the will of Allah. They were treated as such for their betrayal as they broke their pact with the Prophet (ﷺ)."
  59,6,"Whatever gains Allah has bestowed upon His Messenger from them, you did not spur on any horses or camels for that<sup>7</sup>, but Allah gives authority to His messengers over whom He wills, and Allah is Most Capable of all things.","[7] i.e., they went through no hardship (i.e., war) to gain it."
  59,7,"Whatever gains Allah has bestowed upon His Messenger from the people of the towns belongs to Allah and the Messenger, and to his close relatives<sup>8</sup>, orphans, the needy, and stranded wayfarers<sup>9</sup>, so that wealth should not circulate only among those of you who are rich. Whatever the Messenger gives you, accept it, and whatever he forbids you, refrain from it. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in punishment.","[8] Those of Banū Hāshim and Banū Muttalib, the close relatives of the Prophet (ﷺ), as compensation for them being prohibited from accepting zakah.\n [9] This ruling concerning properties abandoned by disbelievers without engaging in war varies from that in Surat al-Anfāl, verse 41, which refers to spoils of war in which four-fifths is distributed among those believers who participated in the war."
  59,8,"For the poor emigrants [there is a due share] who were driven out of their homes and their properties, seeking Allah’s bounty and pleasure, and helping the cause of Allah and His Messenger. It is they who are the truthful.",""
  59,9,"As for those who were settled in the city [of Madinah]<sup>10</sup> and embraced Islam before them, they love those who migrated to them and find no covetous desire in their hearts for what they were given. Rather they give them preference over themselves even though they may be in dire need. Whoever is protected from the covetousness of their souls, it is they who are successful.","[10] Referring to the dwellers of Madinah, Ansār (the Helpers) who helped the believers and the Islamic cause since the inception of the Prophet’s mission."
