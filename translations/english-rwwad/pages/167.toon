  7,142,"We appointed for Moses thirty nights and completed it with ten more, whereby the term of forty nights set by Allah was fulfilled. Moses said to his brother Aaron, “Take my place among my people in my absence, keep things right, and do not follow the way of those who spread corruption.”",""
  7,143,"When Moses came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, “My Lord, reveal Yourself to me so that I may look at You.” Allah said, “You will not be able to see Me<sup>47</sup>.

When he recovered, he said, “Glory be to You! I repent to You and I am the first of the believers.”","[47] None can see Allah in the life of this world."
