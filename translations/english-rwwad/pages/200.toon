quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,80,"Whether you [O Prophet] seek forgiveness for them or not, even if you seek forgiveness for them seventy times<sup>64</sup>, Allah will never forgive them<sup>65</sup>; that is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger. Allah does not guide the rebellious people.","[64] The number 70 is not meant, but is rather used to denote numerousness per se.\n [65] ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb (رضي الله عنه) reported: “When ‘Abdullāh ibn ’Ubayy ibn Salūl died, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was summoned to Pray for him. As He (ﷺ) stood up, I sprang to him and said: “Messenger of Allah, will you pray over Ibn ’Ubayy, in spite of him saying so and so on the day of so and so!” I recounted to him (ﷺ) what he said. The Messenger (ﷺ) smiled and said: “Move away from me ‘Umar.” When I had argued a great deal with him, he said: “I was given a choice and I made my choice. Had I known that if I were to seek forgiveness for him more than seventy times he would be forgiven, I would have sought it more!” The Messenger (ﷺ) prayed and then left. It was just a short while after that the two verses in Barā’ah (al-Tawbah) came down: “Do not ever pray over anyone of them who dies … died while in a state of contravention”…” [Al-Bukhārī: 1366]."
  9,81,"Those who remained behind rejoiced for doing so in defiance of the Messenger of Allah, and disliked to strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives<sup>66</sup>, and said, “Do not march forth in this heat<sup>67</sup>.” Say, “The Fire of Hell is more intense in heat.” – If only they could understand!","[66] While in reality, Allah had prevented their participation knowing of their hypocrisy and evil intent.\n [67] In the Tabuk Expedition."
  9,82,"Let them laugh a little and weep a lot as a recompense for what they used to do.",""
  9,83,"If Allah brings you back to a group of them and they ask your permission to go forth with you, say, “You will never go forth with me, nor will you ever fight an enemy with me. You were content to remain behind the first time, so now stay with those who remained behind<sup>68</sup>.”","[68] It is used here to impart a derogatory sense because of their incapacity."
  9,84,"Never offer the funeral prayer for any of them who dies, nor stand by his grave, for they have disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and died as evildoers.",""
  9,85,"Do not let their wealth or their children impress you; Allah only intends to punish them with these things in this world, and to let their souls depart while they are disbelievers<sup>69</sup>.","[69] The wording of this verse is almost identical to verse 55 above, reiterating its message."
  9,86,"Whenever a Chapter is sent down [saying], “Believe in Allah and fight along with His Messenger,” the affluent among them would ask you to excuse them, saying, “Let us remain with those who stay behind<sup>70</sup>.”","[70] i.e., the weak, the terminally ill and the incapacitated."
