quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  10,1,"Alif Lām Ra<sup>1</sup>. These are the verses of the Book of wisdom.","[1] See footnote 2:1."
  10,2,"Is it surprising to people that We have sent revelation to a man from among themselves to warn people<sup>2</sup> and give glad tidings to those who believe, that they will have a noble position with their Lord? But the disbelievers say, “This man is a clear magician!<sup>3</sup>”","[2] i.e., Quraysh disbelievers.\n [3] They could only rationalize the bewildering effect of the Message by saying that it bewitches people."
  10,3,"Allah is your Lord Who created the heavens and earth in six Days and then rose over the Throne<sup>4</sup>, governing all affairs<sup>5</sup>. None can intercede except by His permission<sup>6</sup>. Such is Allah your Lord, so worship Him. Will you not then take heed?","[4] See footnote 7:54.\n [5] This is a manifest sign of Allah’s omnipotence, and thus He alone is worthy of worship.\n [6] He is not like any sovereign whose inner circle of close aides and relatives dare to intercede, relying on his need for them."
  10,4,"To Him is your return altogether. Allah’s promise will surely come true. He originates the creation then brings it back, so that He may justly reward those who believe and do righteous deeds. But for those who disbelieve, there will be a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment because of their disbelief.",""
  10,5,"It is He Who made the sun a radiant light<sup>7</sup> and the moon a reflected light<sup>8</sup>, and precisely determined its phases, so that you may know the number of years and account [of time]<sup>9</sup>. Allah has not created all of this except for a true purpose<sup>10</sup>. He makes the signs clear for people who know.","[7] Diyā’ is glowing with glaring light.\n [8] Nūr is reflected light. [9] It provides concrete signs of Allah’s Lordship.\n [10] The wisdom is to lead people to realize the Oneness of Allah."
  10,6,"Indeed, in the alternation of the night and day, and in what Allah has created in the heavens and earth, there are signs<sup>11</sup> for people who fear Him.","[11] These are cosmic signs (āyāt kawniyyah)."
