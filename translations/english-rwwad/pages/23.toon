quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,146,"Those whom We gave the Scripture recognize him [i.e., the Prophet] as they recognize their own sons, yet a group of them conceals the truth knowingly<sup>63</sup>.","[63] That the Ka‘bah is the correct direction of Prayer."
  2,147,"It is the truth from your Lord; so never be among those who doubt.",""
  2,148,"Every nation has a direction to which it turns, so compete with one another in good deeds. Wherever you are, Allah will bring you all together, for Allah is Most Capable of all things.",""
  2,149,"From wherever you set out, turn your face to the direction of the Sacred Mosque [in Makkah]. This is surely the truth from your Lord, and Allah is not unaware of what you do.",""
  2,150,"From wherever you set out, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque [i.e., Ka‘bah]. Wherever you are, turn your faces towards it, so that the people should not have any proof against you<sup>64</sup>, except for the wrongdoers among them. So do not fear them but fear Me, so that I may complete My favor upon you [all] and that you may be guided.","[64] One of the reasons for the change of qiblah was so that the Jews would have no argument against the Muslims."
  2,151,"Just as We have sent you a messenger from among you, reciting to you Our verses, purifying you, and teaching you the Book and Wisdom<sup>65</sup>, and teaching you what you did not know.","[65] The wisdom taught by the Prophet (ﷺ) is his Sunnah."
  2,152,"Therefore remember Me; I will remember you<sup>66</sup>. Be grateful to Me, and do not be ungrateful.","[66] Remember Me (by praying, glorifying, etc), and I will remember you (by remembering you and bestowing countless favors on you). Allah says in a Qudsi Hadith: ""...If he remembers Me in himself, I remember him in Myself; and if he remembers Me in a group, I remember him in a group better than them..."" [Al-Bukhāri and Muslim]"
  2,153,"O you who believe, seek help in patience and prayer, for Allah is with those who are patient<sup>67</sup>.","[67] Allah is with them; by guiding and supporting them."
