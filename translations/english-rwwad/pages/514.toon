quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  48,24,"It is He Who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them near Makkah<sup>13</sup>, after giving you the upper hand over them. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.","[13] A group of pagans of Makkah who were around eighty people came to attack the Muslims in Hudaybiyyah on their way to Makkah, but Muslims were able to take them as captives, then released them."
  48,25,"It is they who disbelieved and prevented you from the Sacred Mosque and detained the sacrificial animals<sup>14</sup> from reaching their place of sacrifice. If it had not been for the believing men and women whom you could not identify, you might have trampled over them, thus incurring guilt unknowingly, [We would have let you march to Makkah]. [This was] so that Allah may admit to His mercy whom He wills<sup>15</sup>. If they had been distinct [from the disbelievers], We would surely have inflicted on those who disbelieved among them a painful punishment.","[14] i.e., The Prophet (ﷺ) had brought along with him seventy camels to be sacrificed after completing the rituals of ‘Umrah (the minor pilgrimage).\n [15] Thus, not only the Muslims in Makkah who were not known to their fellow believers were safe, but also those pagans who later embraced Islam were safe too."
  48,26,"When the disbelievers harbored pride in their hearts – the pride of ignorance<sup>16</sup> – then Allah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers, and caused them to adhere to the word of piety<sup>17</sup>, for they were more deserving and worthy of it. And Allah is All-Knowing of everything.","[16] This was when the pagans of Makkah prevented the Prophet (ﷺ) and the believers from entering the Sacred House to perform ‘Umrah for fear that Arabs would consider this a shame and insult to the pagans for allowing Muslims to enter Makkah.\n [17] That none has the right to be worshiped except Allan, and that Muhammad is His messenger (declaration of faith)."
  48,27,"Indeed, Allah has fulfilled His Messenger’s dream in truth: that you will surely enter the Sacred Mosque if Allah wills, in peace and safety, and you will have your heads shaved or shortened<sup>18</sup>, without any fear. He knew what you did not know, and He granted you prior to that an imminent conquest<sup>19</sup>.","[18] Shaving or trimming hair is from the requirements upon completing the rites of pilgrimage.\n [19] Referring to the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah and subsequently the conquest of Khaybar prior to the fulfillment of the Prophet’s dream regarding entering Makkah for pilgrimage."
  48,28,"It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, to make it prevail over all religions, and sufficient is Allah as a Witness.",""
