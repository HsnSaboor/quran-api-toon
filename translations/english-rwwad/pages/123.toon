quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,90,"O you who believe, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters<sup>65</sup> and divining arrows are of Satan’s evil work; therefore avoid such [evil], so that you may be successful.","[65] Ansāb are stones or idols that were erected for worship and sacrificial offerings."
  5,91,"Satan only wants to create enmity and hatred between you through intoxicants and gambling, and to prevent you from remembering Allah and from prayer. Will you not then abstain?",""
  5,92,"Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and be cautious. But if you turn away, then know that the duty of Our Messenger is only to convey the message clearly.",""
  5,93,"There is no blame on those who believe and do righteous deeds for what they consumed before [its prohibition], so long as they fear Allah, believe and do righteous deeds, then they fear Allah [more] and believe, then they fear Allah and do good, for Allah loves those who do good.",""
  5,94,"O you who believe, Allah will surely test you with game within the reach of your hands and spears, so that Allah may distinguish those who fear Him unseen. Whoever transgresses after that, for him there will be a painful punishment.",""
  5,95,"O you who believe, do not kill game while you are on pilgrimage<sup>66</sup>. Whoever of you kills it deliberately should compensate by offering its equivalent – as judged by two just men among you – to be offered at the Sacred House, or by feeding the needy, or by fasting its equivalent, so that he may taste the consequence of his deed. Allah has pardoned what has passed, but whoever does it again, Allah will subject him to retribution, for Allah is All-Mighty, Capable of Retribution.","[66] See footnote above 5:1."
