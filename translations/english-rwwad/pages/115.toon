quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,42,"They eagerly listen to lies and consume unlawful gains. If they come to you [O Prophet], either judge between them or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they cannot harm you in the least. But if you judge, then judge between them with justice, for Allah loves those who are just.",""
  5,43,"But how is it that they seek your judgment when they have the Torah which contains Allah’s judgment, and they still turn away? Such people are not believers.",""
  5,44,"We sent down the Torah which contains guidance and light; the prophets who submitted themselves to Allah were judging by it for the Jews, and so did the rabbis<sup>40</sup> and scholars because they were entrusted to protect the Scripture of Allah, and they were witnesses to it. So do not fear people but fear Me, and do not trade My verses for a small price<sup>41</sup>. Whoever does not judge according to what Allah has revealed, it is they who are the disbelievers.","[40] Al-Rabbāniyyūn (sing. rabbānī) are men of extensive knowledge, both religious and worldly. This includes the wise scholar, the mindful jurisprudent, the reforming teacher, and the person who enjoins others to uphold the teachings of religion.\n [41] The guardians of Divine law should bear the fear of Allah first and foremost and not that of fellow men, nor are they to be swayed by bribes and worldly gains."
  5,45,"We ordained for them therein, “A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds equal retaliation<sup>42</sup>.” But if anyone waives it charitably, then it will be an expiation for him<sup>43</sup>. Whoever does not judge according to what Allah has revealed, it is they who are the wrongdoers.","[42] This verse alludes to the law known as ""lex talionis"" (law of retaliation/reciprocal justice) which states that justice should be carried out: ‘ayin tachat ‘ayin, “an eye for an eye”, as told in the Torah (Exodus 21: 24) but which was distorted from its proper, fully-known position. The Qur’an re-establishes this principle.\n [43] Forgiveness is not only encouraged by Allah but is also rewarded for."
