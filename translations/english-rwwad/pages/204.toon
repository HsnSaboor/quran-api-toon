quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,107,"There are those [hypocrites] who built a mosque to cause harm<sup>80</sup>, promote disbelief and create division among the believers, and as a base for those who had previously fought against Allah and His Messenger. They will surely swear, “We intend nothing but good,” but Allah testifies that they are indeed liars.","[80] The most conniving hypocrites in Madinah built a mosque ‘masjid al-dirār’ (the mosque of harm) to cause dissension and discord among Muslims."
  9,108,"Never pray therein [O Prophet]. A mosque that was founded on piety<sup>81</sup> from the first day is more deserving for you to pray therein. In it are men who love to keep themselves pure, and Allah loves those who keep themselves pure.","[81] This is the description of the Qubā’ mosque."
  9,109,"Who is better – one who laid the foundation of his building on piety and seeking Allah’s pleasure; or one who laid the foundation of his building on the edge of a crumbling precipice, so it tumbled down with him into the Fire of Hell? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.",""
  9,110,"This building which they built will not cease to be a source of unrest in their hearts until their hearts are cut into pieces. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",""
  9,111,"Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their wealth, and in return they will have Paradise<sup>82</sup>; they fight in the cause of Allah and they kill or are killed. This is a true promise, given by Him in the Torah, the Gospel and the Qur’an. Who is more faithful to his promise than Allah? Rejoice then in the transaction you have made with Him; that is the supreme triumph.","[82] Jābir ibn ‘Abdullah (رضي الله عنهما) reported: ""On the day of the battle of Uhud, a man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ""Can you tell me where I will be if I am martyred?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied: ""In Paradise."" The man threw away some dates he was carrying in his hand, and fought till he was martyred."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 377]"
