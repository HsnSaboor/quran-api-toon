quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,17,"Their likeness is that of someone who kindles a fire. When it illuminates all around him, Allah takes away their light, leaving them in utter darkness, unable to see<sup>12</sup>.","[12] This is the situation of the hypocrites in the darkness of doubt and disbelief, not seeing the truth and guidance."
  2,18,"Deaf, dumb, and blind; they will not return [to the straight path].",""
  2,19,"Or like a downpour from the sky accompanied by darkness, thunder, and lightning. They put their fingers into their ears out of thunderclaps, for fear of death. But Allah encompasses the disbelievers.",""
  2,20,"The lightning almost snatches away their eyesight. Every time lightning<sup>13</sup> strikes, they walk in its light, but when it becomes dark, they stand still. If Allah had willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight; for Allah is Most Capable of all things.","[13] The parable of lightning is that of the light of the Qur’an."
  2,21,"O people, worship your Lord, Who created you and those before you, so that you may become righteous;",""
  2,22,"He Who made the earth a resting place for you, and the sky a canopy; and sends down rain from the sky, and brings forth fruits thereby as a provision for you. So do not set up rivals to Allah while you know<sup>14</sup>.","[14] Do not set up rivals to Allah (in worship), Who has provided you with all these things, and you know that He alone is worthy of worship."
  2,23,"If you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down upon Our slave<sup>15</sup>, then produce a chapter like it and call upon your helpers other than Allah, if you are truthful.","[15] “Our servant” is referring to Muhammad (ﷺ)."
  2,24,"But if you did not do it, and you can never do it; then beware of the Fire whose fuel will be people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers.",""
