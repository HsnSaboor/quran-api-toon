quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  60,12,"O Prophet, when the believing women come to you, pledging to you that they will not associate anything with Allah, that they will not steal, that they will not commit fornication, that they will not kill their children, that they will not falsely attribute [illegitimate] children to their husbands between their arms and their legs<sup>7</sup>, that they will not disobey you in what is right, then accept their pledge and ask Allah to forgive them. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","[7] It is alluding to falsely attributing a child, whether adopted or born of adultery, to the husband."
  60,13,"O you who believe, do not take as allies a people whom Allah is displeased with. They have lost hope in the Hereafter, just as the disbelievers have lost hope in those who are in the graves.",""
  61,1,"All that is in the heavens and all that is on earth glorifies Allah, for He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.",""
  61,2,"O you who believe, why do you say what you do not do?",""
  61,3,"It is most loathsome to Allah that you say what you do not do.",""
  61,4,"Indeed, Allah loves those who fight in His way in firm ranks, as if they were a solid structure.",""
  61,5,"And [remember] when Moses said to his people, “O my people, why do you hurt me when you know that I am a messenger of Allah to you?” So when they chose to deviate, Allah caused their hearts to deviate, for Allah does not guide the rebellious people.",""
