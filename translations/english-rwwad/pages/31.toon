quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,197,"The pilgrimage is in known months<sup>97</sup>. Whoever commits himself to perform the pilgrimage, there should be no intimacy, foul language, and arguments during the pilgrimage. Whatever good you do, Allah is aware of it. And take provisions for the journey, but the best provision is righteousness. So fear Me, O people of understanding.","[97] These are: Shawwal, Dhū al-Qi‘dah, and the first ten days of Dhū al-Hijjah."
  2,198,"There is no blame upon you for seeking the bounty of your Lord [by trading]. But as you leave the plains of ‘Arafāt, remember Allah at the Sacred Site [in Muzdalifah] and remember Him for having guided you, for you were previously among those who had gone astray.",""
  2,199,"Then move on from where the people move on<sup>98</sup>, and seek Allah’s forgiveness, for Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","[98] The addressees are the Quraysh, who held back from going to ‘Arafāt and instead remained in Muzdalifah, considering themselves above others."
  2,200,"When you have completed your rites, remember Allah as you used to remember your forefathers<sup>99</sup>, or even with greater remembrance. There are some people who say, “Our Lord, give us in this world,” but they will have no share in the Hereafter.","[99] The Arabs were very fond of talking without end about the chivalric and heroic deeds of their ancestors."
  2,201,"And there are others<sup>100</sup> who say, “Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the punishment of the Fire.”","[100] These are the ones who are well-guided."
  2,202,"They<sup>101</sup> will receive their share of what they have earned. And Allah is swift in reckoning.","[101] Those who supplicate with this prayer."
