quran[11]{c,v,t,f}:
  18,35,"He entered his garden, having wronged himself<sup>22</sup>, and said, “I do not think that this will ever perish,","[22] By being proud and disbeliever."
  18,36,"nor do I think that the Hour will ever come. Even if I am brought back to my Lord, I will surely find something better than this<sup>23</sup>.”","[23] He thought should there be a tiny possibility of resurrection, based on his wrongful calculation that he was honored in this life because Allah loved him. Hence he fell into the fallacy that if he ever return to Him, he should only expect greater honoring, or he might have said that deridingly."
  18,37,"His companion said, while conversing with him, “Do you disbelieve in He Who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then fashioned you into a well-proportioned man<sup>24</sup>?","[24] The One Who created such a magnificent creation in the first place is able to recreate the creatures."
  18,38,"As for me: He is Allah, my Lord, and I do not associate anyone with my Lord.",""
  18,39,"If only you had said, when you entered your garden, ‘This is by Allah’s Will; there is no power except with Allah.’ Even though you see me as inferior to you in wealth and children,",""
  18,40,"it may well be that my Lord will give me something better than your garden, and send upon your garden a thunderbolt from the heaven, turning it into a barren land.",""
  18,41,"Or its water may sink, so you will never be able to get it back.”",""
  18,42,"Eventually, all his produce was destroyed and he started wringing his hands [in dismay] over what he had spent on it, as it had collapsed on its trellises, and he said, “Oh, would that I had not associated anyone with my Lord!”",""
  18,43,"He had none to support him against Allah, nor could he support himself.",""
  18,44,"In that situation<sup>25</sup>, the authority only rests with Allah, the True God. He is best in reward and best in outcome.","[25] i.e., on the Day of Judgment."
  18,45,"Give them the example of the life of this world: it is like the plants of the earth, thriving when sustained by the rain We send down from the sky, but soon they turn into chaff scattered by the winds. Allah has full power over all things.",""
