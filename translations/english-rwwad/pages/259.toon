quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  14,25,"yielding its fruit all the times<sup>15</sup>, by the permission of its Lord. Allah makes such comparisons for people, so that they may take heed.","[15] i.e., day and night, summer and winter; likewise is the testimony of faith, it never ceases to yield good deeds all the time."
  14,26,"But an evil word<sup>16</sup> is like an evil tree<sup>17</sup>, uprooted from the surface of the earth, having no stability.","[16] i.e., the word of disbelief and polytheism.\n [17] i.e., the tree of colocynth; it has no stable root and its stalks are so feeble; such is disbelief which is shaky in the heart, and their deeds are not raised to benefit them in the Hereafter."
  14,27,"Allah keeps those who believe steadfast with the firm Word [of faith] in the life of this world<sup>18</sup> and in the Hereafter. But Allah causes to stray the wrongdoers<sup>19</sup>; Allah does whatever He wills.","[18] When questioned in their graves by the angels.\n [19] For doing wrong to themselves and others, Allah casts doubts and blindness in their hearts and does not guide them to say what is truthful in this life or in the grave."
  14,28,"Did you not see those who exchanged Allah’s blessings with disbelief<sup>20</sup>, and led their people to the abode of ruin<sup>21</sup>?","[20] They met Allah’s blessings with denial instead of gratitude.\n [21] i.e., the Hellfire."
  14,29,"In Hell they will burn; what an evil place to settle in!",""
  14,30,"They set up rivals to Allah to mislead people from His way. Say, “Enjoy yourselves for a while! Your destination will be the Fire.”",""
  14,31,"Tell My slaves who believe to establish prayer and spend from what We have provided for them, secretly and openly, before there comes a Day when there will be no bargaining or friendship<sup>22</sup>.","[22] As everyone will have enough affairs and busied away with their own record; nothing will avail a person except his good deeds."
  14,32,"It is Allah Who has created the heavens and earth and sent down rain from the sky, producing therewith fruits as provision for you. He has made the ships for your service to sail through the sea by His command and has made for you the rivers.",""
  14,33,"He has made the sun and the moon for your service, both constant in their courses, and has made for you the night and the day<sup>23</sup>.","[23] i.e., the day in which people go about their living and the night during which they get rest."
