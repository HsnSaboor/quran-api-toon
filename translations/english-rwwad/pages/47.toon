quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,275,"Those who consume usury will not stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except like those being beaten by Satan. That is because they say, “Trade is just like usury<sup>169</sup>.” But Allah has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Whoever desists because of receiving admonition from his Lord may keep his past gains, and his case is left to Allah. But whoever returns to it, they are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.","[169] The image given here of a person possessed by the devil staggering while standing and walking unsteadily as they are resurrected for the Day of Judgment. It is a just requital because it mimics their insatiable lust for money in this life, twisting the laws ordained by Allah as they declared lawful what is not."
  2,276,"Allah destroys usury and nourishes charities, and Allah does not like any ungrateful sinner.",""
  2,277,"Those who believe, do righteous deeds, establish prayer, and give zakah, will have their reward with their Lord; and they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.",""
  2,278,"O you who believe, fear Allah and give up usury that is still due, if you are truly believers.",""
  2,279,"But if you do not do it, then beware of a declaration of war from Allah and His Messenger. However, if you repent, you may retain your capital – neither harming nor suffering harm<sup>170</sup>.","[170] Neither harming others by receiving interest, and nor suffering harm by preserving your principal capital in full."
  2,280,"If the debtor is in hardship, give him respite until it is easy for him to pay back. But if you waive it as charity<sup>171</sup>, that is better for you, if only you knew.","[171] Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) said: ""A man used to give loans to the people, and used to say to his servant, ‘If the debtor is poor, forgive him, so that Allah may forgive us.’ When he met Allah (after his death), Allah forgave him."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 687]"
  2,281,"And fear the Day when you will be brought back to Allah. Then every soul will be rewarded in full for what it has earned, and none will be wronged.",""
