quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  33,16,"Say, “Fleeing will never benefit you if you try to flee from death or killing, even then you will only be left to enjoy life except for a little while<sup>13</sup>.”","[13] i.e., until your short life on earth comes to an end."
  33,17,"Say, “Who is there that can protect you from Allah if He intends to harm you<sup>14</sup> or show you mercy?” They will not find besides Allah any protector or helper.","[14] i.e., by killing or death."
  33,18,"Allah knows well those among you who discourage others<sup>15</sup> and those [hypocrites] who say to their brothers, “Come and join us<sup>16</sup>,” and they hardly take part in the battle<sup>17</sup>.","[15] From supporting the Prophet (ﷺ) in battle.\n [16] Instead of joining the Prophet (ﷺ).\n [17] If they go out, they do so for ulterior motives, not to help the Prophet (ﷺ)."
  33,19,"They are niggardly<sup>18</sup> towards you. When danger comes, you see them looking at you with their eyes rolling like someone in the throes of death. But when danger is over, they slash you with sharp tongues, in greed for gains. Such people have not truly believed, so Allah will render their deeds worthless. That is easy for Allah.","[18] i.e., stingy, not willing to provide any help."
  33,20,"They think that the Confederates have not yet gone<sup>19</sup>. If the Confederates were to come again, they would wish that they were away in the desert with Bedouins, asking for news of you. Even if they were among you, they would hardly take part in the fight.","[19] Due to their excessive cowardice, the hypocrites could not believe that the non-Muslim allied forces had left."
  33,21,"Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example<sup>20</sup> for those who look forward to Allah and the Last Day, and remember Allah much.","[20] i.e., a role model to be followed."
  33,22,"When the believers saw the confederates, they said, “This is what Allah and His messenger had promised us<sup>21</sup>, and Allah and His messenger have told the truth.” And it only increased them in faith and submission.","[21] Of trial, hardship, and victory."
