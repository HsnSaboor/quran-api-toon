quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,125,"Whoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his heart to Islam; and whoever He wills to lead astray, He makes his heart tight and constricted<sup>41</sup>, as if he were climbing up into the sky. This is how Allah punishes those who do not believe.","[41] Due to his arrogance and persistence in sin."
  6,126,"This is the straight path of your Lord. We have made the verses clear for people who take heed.",""
  6,127,"They will have the Home of Peace with their Lord, and He will be their Protector because of what they used to do.",""
  6,128,"On the Day when He will gather them all together [saying], “O assembly of jinn, you have misled many humans.” Their human friends will say, “Our Lord, we have benefited from one another<sup>42</sup>, but now we have reached our term which You appointed for us.” He will say, “The Fire is your abode, abiding therein forever, except if Allah wills otherwise.” Your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.","[42] The jinn enjoyed the humans by obeying and worshiping them and the humans enjoyed the jinn by fulfilling their wishes and gratifying their lusts."
  6,129,"This is how We make the wrongdoers take control over one another<sup>43</sup> because of what they used to do.","[43] By misguiding and inciting to do evil deeds."
  6,130,"“O assembly of jinn and humans, did there not come to you messengers from among you, reciting to you My verses and warning you of meeting this Day of yours?” They will say, “We testify against ourselves.” They were deluded by the life of this world, and they will testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.",""
  6,131,"This is because your Lord would never destroy a town for their wrongdoing while its people are unaware [of the truth].",""
