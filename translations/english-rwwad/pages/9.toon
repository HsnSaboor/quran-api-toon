quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,58,"And [remember] when We said, “Enter this town [of Jerusalem] and eat freely from wherever you wish, and enter the gate bowing down humbly and say, ‘Absolve us<sup>32</sup>.’ We will forgive you your sins and increase [the reward of] those who do good.”","[32] In gratitude to Allah and admission of sin."
  2,59,"But the wrongdoers changed the words to other than what they were told<sup>33</sup>; so We sent down upon the wrongdoers a torment from the heaven for their rebelliousness.","[33] They were asked to seek forgiveness. The word is hittah, which means: to put down a burden, but they twisted their tongues to mean ‘barley’, hintah."
  2,60,"And [remember] when Moses asked for water for his people, and We said, “Strike the rock with your staff,” Then twelve springs gushed forth from it; each tribe knew its drinking place<sup>34</sup>. “Eat and drink from Allah’s provision, and do not spread corruption in the land.”","[34] The twelve tribes of the Children of Israel, who are called ""Asbāt""."
  2,61,"And [remember] when you said, “O Moses, we cannot bear the same meal. So call upon your Lord to bring forth for us from what the earth produces – its herbs, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions.” Moses said, “Would you exchange what is better for what is inferior? Go down to any town and you will have what you have asked for.” They were struck with humiliation and destitution, and incurred the wrath of Allah. That was because they used to reject the signs of Allah and kill the prophets unjustly. That was because they disobeyed and were transgressors.",""
