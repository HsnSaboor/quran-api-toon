quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  18,21,"This is how We made their case known so that the people might know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour. When they were disputing among themselves<sup>13</sup> concerning their matter [of resurrection], they said, “Build a structure over them. Their Lord knows best about them.” Those who prevailed in their matter said, “We will surely build over them a place of worship.”","[13] i.e., the inhabitants of the city."
  18,22,"Some will say, “They were three, their dog was the fourth,” while others will say, “They were five, their dog was the sixth,” – merely guessing at the unseen. And others will say, “They were seven, their dog was the eighth.” Say, “My Lord knows best their number; no one knows about them except a few<sup>14</sup>. So do not argue about them except in a brief manner, nor ask anyone about them.”","[14] i.e., that which is the sure argument, one in the Qur’an."
  18,23,"And never say about anything, “I will surely do this tomorrow<sup>15</sup>,”","[15] For you do not know whether you will be able to do it or you will be diverted from it."
  18,24,"without adding, “if Allah wills.” And remember your Lord if you forget, and say, “My Lord will hopefully guide me to something closer to what is right<sup>16</sup>.”","[16] As soon as one remembers not saying inshā’ Allah concerning doing something in the future, he should say it. Also when one forgets something, he should mention Allah so as to remember things."
  18,25,"They remained in their cave for three hundred years, plus nine<sup>17</sup>.","[17] i.e., 309 years."
  18,26,"Say, “Allah knows best how long they remained. To Him belongs [the knowledge of] the unseen of the heavens and earth. How well He sees and how well He hears<sup>18</sup>! They have no protector besides Him, and He shares His command with none.”","[18] i.e., Nothing can escape Allah’s Sight and Hearing."
  18,27,"Recite what has been revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. None can change His Words, and you will never find any refuge except with Him<sup>19</sup>.","[19] There is no escape from the punishment of Allah, should the Message not be conveyed, recited, and followed accordingly."
