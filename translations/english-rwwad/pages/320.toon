  20,114,"So Exalted is Allah, the True Sovereign<sup>41</sup>. Do not hasten to [recite] the Qur’an before its revelation to you is concluded<sup>42</sup>, and say, “My Lord, increase me in knowledge.”","[41] Of everything in existence.\n [42] Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) was eager to recite the Qur’an while it was being revealed, so Allah Almighty told him to avoid being in haste in order to learn them before the verses are properly delivered; rather, listen to them attentively."
  20,115,"We had already given a command to Adam before, but he forgot, and We found him lacking a firm resolve<sup>43</sup>.","[43] To resist the temptation of eating from the forbidden tree."
  20,116,"When We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” they all prostrated, except Iblīs<sup>44</sup>, who refused.","[44] See footnote 2:34."
  20,117,"We said “O Adam, this is an enemy to you and to your wife, so do not let him drive you both out of Paradise, for then you will fall into misery.",""
  20,118,"Here you will neither go hungry nor naked,",""
  20,119,"nor will you suffer from thirst or from scorching heat.”",""
  20,120,"Then Satan whispered to him, and said, “O Adam, shall I show you the tree of immortality and a kingdom that will never decay?”",""
  20,121,"So they both ate from the tree, then their nakedness was revealed to each other, and they began to put together leaves from Paradise to cover themselves. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord and fell into error<sup>45</sup>.","[45] Unlike the Bible, the Qur’an does not put the blame on Eve for Adam’s sin, for which they were ousted from the Garden and sent down to the earth. See: (Genesis 3)."
  20,122,"Thereafter his Lord chose him, accepted his repentance, and guided him.",""
  20,123,"Allah said, “Get down, both of you, from here altogether [with Satan] as enemies to one another. Then when there comes to you guidance from Me, whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray nor fall into misery<sup>46</sup>.","[46] Neither go astray (in this life) nor fall into misery (in the Hereafter)."
  20,124,"But whoever turns away from My Reminder<sup>47</sup> will have a miserable life, and on the Day of Resurrection We will raise him blind.”","[47] i.e., the Qur’an."
  20,125,"He will say, “My Lord, why have you raised me blind when I was able to see before?”",""
