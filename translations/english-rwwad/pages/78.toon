quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,7,"Men have a share in what parents and relatives leave behind, and women have a share in what parents and relatives leave behind, whether it is little or much; an ordained share<sup>6</sup>.","[6] This ‘ordained share’ is detailed in verse 11-12 below."
  4,8,"If at the time of distribution, [other] relatives, orphans, and the needy are present, give them something too<sup>7</sup>, and speak to them kindly.","[7] Those who have no share in the inheritance."
  4,9,"And let those [in charge of orphans] be cautious just as they themselves would be concerned had they left helpless offspring behind; let them fear Allah and say words of justice.",""
  4,10,"Indeed, those who consume the orphans’ property unjustly, only consume fire into their bellies<sup>8</sup>, and they will burn in a Blazing Fire.","[8] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Beware of the seven most cardinal sins: And among them he mentioned consuming an orphan’s property”. [Al-Bukhārī, 6857; Muslim, 89]"
  4,11,"Allah instructs you concerning [the inheritance of] your children: the share of a male is equal to that of two females. If there are only daughters, two or more, they get two-thirds of the estate, but if there is only one daughter, she gets half. Each parent is entitled to one-sixth if he left offspring, but if he left no offspring and the parents are the only heirs, the mother gets one-third, but if he has siblings, the mother gets one-sixth, after settling any bequests or debts<sup>9</sup>. Your parents and your children, you do not know which of them will benefit you more. [These shares are] ordained by Allah; and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.","[9] Based upon prophetic Hadīths, scholars have ruled that debt takes precedence over a bequest, that a bequest should not include anyone who inherit by law, and that the total bequest should not be more than one third of the estate. After the fulfillment of debts and bequests (if any), the remainder of the estate is to be divided."
