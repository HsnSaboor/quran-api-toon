quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,188,"Say, “I have no power to benefit or harm myself, except what Allah wills. If I had knowledge of the unseen, I would have acquired much good, and no evil would have touched me. I am only a warner and bearer of glad tidings for people who believe.”",""
  7,189,"It is He Who created you from a single soul, and from it He made its spouse<sup>82</sup>, so that he may find comfort in her. When he covered her<sup>83</sup>, she conceived a light burden carrying it with ease. Then when she grew heavy, they called upon Allah, their Lord, “If you give us a healthy child<sup>84</sup>, we will certainly be grateful.”","[82] Adam and his mate, Eve.\n [83] An allusion to sexual relation.\n [84] Physically sound or righteous."
  7,190,"But when He gave them a healthy child, they<sup>85</sup> ascribed partners to Him in that which He had given them. Exalted is Allah far above what they ascribe to Him.","[85] The ungrateful or the polytheistic man and woman."
  7,191,"Do they ascribe to Him partners who cannot create anything, but are themselves created?",""
  7,192,"They cannot help them, nor can they help themselves.",""
  7,193,"If you call them to guidance, they will not follow you; it is the same whether you call them or remain silent.",""
  7,194,"Those whom you supplicate besides Allah are slaves like you; supplicate them and let them respond to you, if you are truthful.",""
  7,195,"Do they have feet to walk with? Or hands to grasp with? Or eyes to see with? Or ears to hear with? Say [O Prophet], “Call your idols then conspire against me and give me no respite<sup>86</sup>!","[86] This outright challenge highlights the powerlessness of their gods."
