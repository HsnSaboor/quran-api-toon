quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,1,"Alif Lām Mīm<sup>1</sup>.","[1] See footnote 2:1."
  3,2,"Allah: None has the right to be worshiped except Him, the Ever-Living, the All-Sustaining.",""
  3,3,"He has sent down to you the Book<sup>2</sup> in truth, confirming what came before it. And He sent down<sup>3</sup> the Torah and the Gospel","[2] i.e., the Qur’an. [3] The difference between ‘nazzala’ (sent down) which is mentioned only with regards to the Qur’an, which signifies that the action took place in installments over a long period of time. Whereas ‘anzala’ (sent down) which is said with regards to the Torah and the Gospel, which happened once and as a whole. [Al-Tabarī]."
  3,4,"previously, as guidance for people, and He sent down the Criterion [between right and wrong]. But those who reject the verses of Allah will suffer severe punishment, and Allah is All-Mighty, Capable of Retribution.",""
  3,5,"Indeed, there is nothing hidden from Allah on earth or in heaven.",""
  3,6,"It is He Who shapes you in the wombs as He wills. None has the right to be worshiped except Him, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.",""
  3,7,"It is He Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are definite verses, which are the foundation of the Book; while others are ambiguous. Those with deviant hearts follow the ambiguous verses, seeking discord and seeking their [false] interpretation. But no one knows their [true] interpretation except Allah. And those who are well-grounded in knowledge say, “We believe in it. It is all from our Lord<sup>4</sup>.” None will take heed except people of understanding.","[4] People of true knowledge are lauded here with the worthy epithet “al-rāsikhūna fī al-‘ilm”(the well-grounded in knowledge); they know enough and are so humble as to say: “Allah knows best”, unlike others."
  3,8,"“Our Lord, do not let our hearts deviate<sup>5</sup> after You have guided us, and grant us Your mercy; for You are the Munificent Bestower.","[5] ’Umm Salamah (رضي الله عنها) reported: “The Prophet (ﷺ) used to pray most by saying: “O He Who changes hearts, make my heart firm in Your religion” (yā Muqallib al-qulūb, thabbit qalbī ‘alā dīnik). When she asked him the reason for this, he (ﷺ) replied, saying: “Umm Salamah, know that every human’s heart is between two Fingers of Allah. Whoever He wills, He makes steadfast, and Whoever He wills He causes to deviate”. [Al-Tirmidhī: 3522]"
  3,9,"Our Lord, You will surely gather all people for a Day<sup>6</sup> about which there is no doubt; for Allah does not break His promise.”","[6] The Day of Judgment."
