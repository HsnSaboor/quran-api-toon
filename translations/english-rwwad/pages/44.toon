  2,260,"And [remember] when Abraham said: “My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead.” He said: “Do you not believe?’’ He said: “I do believe, but just to reassure my heart<sup>158</sup>.’’ Allah said: “Then take four birds and cut them into pieces, then put a piece of each of them on each mountain, then call them; they will come swiftly to you. And know that Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.”","[158] The Prophet (ﷺ) implied by saying: “We are more likely to doubt than Ibrāhīm” [Al-Bukhārī: 4537, Muslim: 151], when he heard that people said Abraham doubted. Scholars are of the opinion that Abraham wanted to reach the highest rank of knowledge ‘concrete certitude’ (haqq al-yaqīn)."
  2,261,"The likeness of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a grain that sprouts seven ears, each ear bearing a hundred grains. And Allah gives multiple [rewards] for whom He wills. And Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.",""
  2,262,"Those who spend their wealth for the sake of Allah, then do not follow up their charity with reminders of generosity or hurtful words; they will have their reward with their Lord, and they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.",""
  2,263,"Kind words and forgiveness are better than charity followed by hurt. And Allah is Self-Sufficient, Most Forbearing.",""
  2,264,"O you who believe, do not nullify your charities with reminders and hurtful words, like the one who spends his wealth to show off before people but does not believe in Allah or the Last Day. His likeness is that of a smooth rock upon which is dust, when it is hit by a heavy rain it is left bare<sup>159</sup>. They will gain no reward from their deeds<sup>160</sup>, and Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.","[159] Soilless and bare, unable to grow plants.\n [160] Their insincere spending will have no harvest to reap in the Hereafter."
