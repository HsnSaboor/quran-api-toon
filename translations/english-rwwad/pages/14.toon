quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,89,"Now that there has come to them a Book from Allah<sup>39</sup>, confirming that which is with them<sup>40</sup> – although they used to pray for victory over the disbelievers in the past. But when there came to them what they recognize [to be true], they rejected it. May the curse of Allah be upon the disbelievers!","[39] i.e., the Qur’an.\n [40] i.e., the Jews."
  2,90,"How miserable is the price for which they sold their souls – disbelieving in Allah’s revelation out of jealous hatred that Allah would send down His grace to whom He wills of His slaves! Thus they have incurred wrath upon wrath<sup>41</sup>, and for the disbelievers, there will be a disgracing punishment.","[41] They deserved double wrath: firstly for their earlier rebelliousness and then for denying Muhammad (ﷺ)."
  2,91,"When it is said to them, “Believe in what Allah has sent down<sup>42</sup>,” they say, “We only believe in what was sent down to us<sup>43</sup>,” and they deny what came afterwards, although it is the truth confirming that which is with them. Say, “Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah before, if you were truly believers?”","[42] i.e., the Qur’an. [43] i.e., the Torah."
  2,92,"Moses came to you with clear signs, yet you took the calf [for worship] in his absence, while you were wrongdoers.",""
  2,93,"And [remember] when We took a covenant from you and We raised above you the mountain [saying], “Hold firmly to what We have given you and obey,” they said, “We hear and disobey.” The love of [worshiping] the calf was engraved in their hearts because of their disbelief. Say, “How wretched is what your faith enjoins you, if you are believers!”",""
