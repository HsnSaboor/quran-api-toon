quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,141,"And so that He may purify the believers and annihilate the disbelievers.",""
  3,142,"Do you think that you would enter Paradise when Allah has not yet seen those of you who struggled in His way and those who remained patient?",""
  3,143,"You did wish for martyrdom<sup>62</sup> before facing it, and now you have seen it with your own eyes.","[62] This is a reminder to the believers, who missed the Battle of Badr, of their talk about wishing to meet the enemy and being martyred. The Battle of Uhud is being alluded to here, as solid intentions and steadfastness are what actually win battles, not mere fancy talk."
  3,144,"Muhammad is no more than a messenger; there were messengers who passed away before him<sup>63</sup>. If he dies or is killed, will you turn back on your heels<sup>64</sup>? Anyone who turns back on his heels will not harm Allah in the least, but Allah will reward those who are grateful.","[63] The laws of nature apply to them too.\n [64] This smacks the faltering position that some Muslims took when it was rumored during the Battle of Uhud that Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) had met his death."
  3,145,"No soul can die except with Allah’s permission at a destined time<sup>65</sup>. Whoever seeks the reward of this world, We will give him thereof, and whoever seeks the reward of the Hereafter, We will give him thereof. And We will reward those who are grateful.","[65] This fact is stated as an encouragement to fight in Allah’s cause."
  3,146,"[Imagine] how many prophets along with the devout men fought, but they did not lose heart because of what they suffered in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken or surrender. And Allah loves those who are patient.",""
  3,147,"All they said was, “Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our excess in our affairs, make firm our feet, and give us victory against the disbelieving people<sup>66</sup>.”","[66] This prayer is very similar to that of those who fought with Saul (Tāloot) against Goliath (Jāloot) See 2: 250."
  3,148,"So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the best reward of the Hereafter<sup>67</sup>, for Allah loves those who do good.","[67] Gaining victory in this life and eternal bliss in Paradise."
