  62,2,"It is He Who has sent among the unlettered [Arabs] a messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His verses and purifying them, and teaching them the Book and Wisdom [i.e., Sunnah], although before that they were clearly misguided.",""
  62,3,"And [he is also sent] to others of them who have not yet joined them, and He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.",""

  62,5,"The similitude of those who were given the Torah but failed to uphold it<sup>1</sup>, is like that of a donkey laden with books<sup>2</sup>. How terrible is the similitude of those who reject the verses of Allah! And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.","[1] i.e., did not put its teachings into practice.\n [2] i.e., They carry the physical burden of the books but are unaware of their contents and do not benefit from them."
  62,6,"Say, “O you who are Jews, if you claim that you alone are Allah’s allies apart from all other people, then wish for death, if you are truthful.",""

And Allah is All-Knowing of the wrongdoers.","[3] Such as disobedience to Allah, distorting of the scriptures, killing of the prophets, claiming to have killed Jesus, accusing Mary of adultery, devouring peoples' wealth unlawfully and usury, etc. See 4:153-158."
  62,8,"Say, “The death from which you run away will surely overcome you, then you will be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, and He will inform you of what you used to do.”",""
