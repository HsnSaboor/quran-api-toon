  8,41,"Know that whatever spoils you obtain, one-fifth belongs to Allah<sup>23</sup> and the Messenger<sup>24</sup>, to his close relatives, the orphans, the needy and the [stranded] travelers – if you truly believe in Allah and in what We sent down to Our slave<sup>25</sup> on the day of Criterion<sup>26</sup> – the day when the two armies met [at Badr]. And Allah is Most Capable of all things.","[23] To be spent in the cause of Allah.\n [24] The tribes of Banu Hāshim and Banu Abdul Muṭṭalib, who were not eligible for zakah. The remaining four-fifths are divided among the soldiers.\n [25] Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ).\n [26] The Battle of Badr."
  8,42,"[Remember] when you were on the near side of the valley [of Badr], and they were on the far side, and the caravan was on the lower ground beneath you. If you had made prior arrangements to encounter, you would have failed to keep that appointment. But [it happened] so that Allah might accomplish what had already been decreed, and so that those who chose to perish would perish after seeing clear evidence, and those who chose to survive would survive after seeing clear evidence. Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",""
  8,43,"[Remember] when Allah showed them to you in your dream as few in number; if He had shown them to you as many, you [believers] would have lost courage and disputed in the matter. But Allah spared you [of that], for He is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts.",""
  8,44,"And [remember] when you met, He made them appear as few in your eyes, and made you appear as few in their eyes, so that Allah may accomplish what was already decreed. And to Allah will return all matters.",""
  8,45,"O you who believe, when you encounter a group [in battle], stand firm and remember Allah much, so that you may triumph<sup>27</sup>.","[27] How to win a victory: 1. To stand firm. 2. To mention Allah profusely and seek His help."
