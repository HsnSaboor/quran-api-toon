quran[10]{c,v,t,f}:
  14,43,"rushing forward with their heads raised up, eyes not blinking<sup>31</sup> and hearts void<sup>32</sup>.","[31] This is their state at the time of resurrection from the graves.\n [32] Their terror-struck hearts are empty; perceiving nothing."
  14,44,"Warn people of the Day when the punishment will come upon them, and the wrongdoers will say, “Our Lord, give us a little more time, so that we may respond to Your call and follow the messengers!” [They will be told], “Did you not swear before that you would never cease to exist?”",""
  14,45,"You lived<sup>33</sup> in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves, and it became clear to you how We dealt with them, and We gave you examples.”","[33] As Qurayshites would pass by the ruined dwellings of the destroyed nations; on their way to Yemen, they would pass by the dwellings of the ‘Ād tribe, and on their way to the Levant, they would pass by the dwellings of the Thamūd tribe, using them as resting posts."
  14,46,"They hatched their plot<sup>34</sup>, but their plot was known to Allah; even if their plot were such that would move mountains<sup>35</sup>.","[34] i.e., to kill the Prophet (ﷺ).\n [35] But due to its feebleness, their plotting was never to remove mountains."
  14,47,"Never think that Allah will fail in His promise to His messengers<sup>36</sup>. Allah is All-Mighty, Capable of Retribution.","[36] i.e., that they would be given victory both in this life and in the Hereafter."
  14,48,"The Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will the heavens<sup>37</sup>, and all will appear before Allah, the One, the Subjugator<sup>38</sup>.","[37] Many exegetes who talk about what befalls the heavens and earth on that Day, opines that the replacement here is of the characteristics (al-sifāt), not of the quintessence (al-dhāt).\n [38] Allah’s revenge will be on the Day of Judgment."
  14,49,"On that Day you will see the wicked bound together in chains<sup>39</sup>,","[39] i.e., their hands and feet will be chained to their necks. See 40:70-72."
  14,50,"their garments will be of pitch and their faces covered with Fire.",""
  14,51,"So that Allah may recompense every soul for what it did. Allah is swift in reckoning.",""
  14,52,"This [Qur’an] is a message for all mankind, so that they may be warned thereby and know that He is One God, and so that the people of understanding may take heed.",""
