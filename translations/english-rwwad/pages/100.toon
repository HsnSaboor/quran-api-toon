quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,135,"O you who believe, stand up for justice as witnesses for Allah<sup>93</sup>, even against yourselves or parents and relatives. Whether one is rich or poor, Allah takes the best care of both. So do not let your desires to cause you swerve from justice. If you distort your testimony or refuse to give it, then Allah is indeed All-Aware of what you do.","[93] Giving testimony should only be meant to please Allah."
  4,136,"O you who believe, believe<sup>94</sup> in Allah, His Messenger, the Book which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Books which He sent down before. Whoever disbelieves in Allah, His angels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last Day has indeed gone far astray.","[94] i.e., renew, confirm and adhere to your faith."
  4,137,"Those who believe then disbelieve, then believe and then again disbelieve, then increase in disbelief – Allah will never forgive them, nor will He guide them to a [straight] way<sup>95</sup>.","[95] They willingly chose the way of loss, so Allah left them with it. See 4:115 above."
  4,138,"Give tidings to the hypocrites, that for them there will be a painful punishment,",""
  4,139,"those who take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Are they seeking power through them? Indeed, all power belongs to Allah.",""
  4,140,"He has already sent down to you in the Book that when you hear Allah’s verses being rejected or ridiculed, do not sit with them until they engage in another discourse, or else you will be like them. Indeed, Allah will gather all the hypocrites and disbelievers together in Hell.",""
