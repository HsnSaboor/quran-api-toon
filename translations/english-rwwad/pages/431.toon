quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  34,23,"No intercession will be of any benefit before Him, except for those whom He gave permission. Until when their hearts are relieved of dread<sup>17</sup>, they will say [to the angels], “What did your Lord just say?” They will say, “The Truth, and He is the Most High, Most Great.”","[17] i.e., the hearts of the angels who will have permission to intercede."
  34,24,"Say, “Who provides for you from the heavens and earth?” Say, “Allah! And surely either we or you<sup>18</sup> are rightly guided or clearly misguided.”","[18] i.e., the believers or the polytheists."
  34,25,"Say, “You will not be questioned about our misdeeds, nor will we be questioned about your deeds.”",""
  34,26,"Say, “Our Lord will gather us together, then He will rightly judge between us, for He is the All-Knowing Judge<sup>19</sup>.”","[19] Al-Fattāh (lit., ""the Opener""): He who decides all matters in truth and justice; opens the way to victory, success, relief, and knowledge."
  34,27,"Say, “Show me those whom you have associated with Him as partners. No indeed! Rather, He is Allah, the All-Mighty, All-Wise.”",""
  34,28,"We have not sent you [O Prophet] except as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind, but most people do not know.",""
  34,29,"They say, “When will this promise come to pass, if you are truthful?”",""
  34,30,"Say, “There is an appointed Day for you that you can neither delay for a while, nor can you bring it forward.”",""
  34,31,"Those who disbelieve say, “We will never believe in this Qur’an or in any [Scripture] before it.” If only you could see when the wrongdoers would be made to stand before their Lord, throwing blame at one another! Those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant, “Had it not been for you, we would have been believers.”",""
