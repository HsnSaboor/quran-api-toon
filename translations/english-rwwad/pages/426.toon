quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  33,55,"There is no blame on the Prophet’s wives [if they are seen unveiled] by their fathers<sup>45</sup>, their sons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons, their sisters’ sons<sup>46</sup>, their fellow [Muslim] women, and their slaves whom they own. And fear Allah [O Prophet’s wives], for Allah is Witness over all things.","[45] Uncles, paternal or maternal, are similar to fathers.\n [46] It is permissible for a woman to appear before these male relatives without wearing a hijāb (a complete covering)."
  33,56,"Indeed, Allah sends His blessings upon the Prophet, and His angels pray for him. O you who believe, invoke Allah’s blessings upon him and send him greetings of peace.",""
  33,57,"Those who offend Allah<sup>47</sup> and His Messenger<sup>48</sup> are cursed by Allah in this world and in the Hereafter, and He has prepared for them a humiliating punishment.","[47] By falsely ascribing children to Him or associating partners with Him.\n [48] By offending him or his household in words or actions."
  33,58,"Those who abuse believing men and women<sup>49</sup> for something they did not commit, will bear the burden of slander and flagrant sin.","[49] By physically harming them or falsely accusing them."
  33,59,"O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters, and the believing women to draw their outer garments<sup>50</sup> over themselves; that is more likely that they will be known [as chaste women] and will not be harassed. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","[50] Jilbāb (pl. jalābīb): a cloak covering the woman's entire body."
  33,60,"If the hypocrites and those who have sickness in their hearts<sup>51</sup>, and the rumormongers in Madinah do not desist, We will surely instruct you [O Prophet] to overpower them, then they will not remain in the city with you except for a short while.","[51] By hiding disbelief and proclaiming faith."
  33,61,"They are cursed; wherever they are found they should be seized and killed outright<sup>52</sup>.","[52] It was a deterrence to the hypocrites, for the Prophet (ﷺ) did not kill anyone of them as long as they claimed to be Muslims."
  33,62,"Such was Allah’s way with those [hypocrites] who came before, and you will find no change in Allah’s way.",""
