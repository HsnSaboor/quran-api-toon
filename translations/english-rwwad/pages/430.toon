quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  34,15,"There was a sign for [the people of] Sheba in their dwelling place: two gardens – one on the right and one on the left. “Eat of your Lord’s provision, and be grateful to Him; a pleasant land and a Forgiving Lord.”",""
  34,16,"But they turned away, so We sent against them a devastating flood<sup>11</sup> and replaced their two gardens with two others of bitter fruit, and tamarisk bushes, and a few lote trees.","[11] i.e., which destroyed their dam and submerged their farms."
  34,17,"This is how We punished them for their ingratitude; would We punish anyone except those who are utterly ungrateful?",""
  34,18,"We placed [a chain of] towns between them and the towns We had blessed<sup>12</sup>, and We made between them well-measured distances<sup>13</sup>: “Travel through them by night and day safely.”","[12] i.e., between the land of the people of Sheba and the land of Makkah and Jerusalem.\n [13] i.e., We placed between them settlements at measured distances for the travelers’ convenience."
  34,19,"But they said, “Our Lord, make [the distance between] our journeys longer<sup>14</sup>,” and they wronged themselves. So We made them tales [of the past], and dispersed them in all directions. Indeed, there are signs in this for everyone who is patient and grateful.","[14] They were bored of a comfortable life and easy traveling. Similarly, the Children of Israel were bored of eating the manna and quails and sought other types of food such as onions, garlic, cucumber, etc. See 2:61."
  34,20,"Satan found his assumption<sup>15</sup> about them<sup>16</sup> to be true, for they followed him, except for a group of the believers,","[15] That he would be able to mislead them.\n [16] i.e., the people of Sheba or humankind in general."
  34,21,"even though he had no authority over them, except that We might distinguish those who believe in the Hereafter from those who are in doubt about it. Your Lord is Watchful over all things.”",""
  34,22,"Say, “Call upon those whom you claim [to be gods] besides Allah. They do not have even an atom’s weight of authority in the heavens or on earth, nor do they have any share in either of them, nor is any of them a helper to Allah.”",""
