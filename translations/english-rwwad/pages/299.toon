  18,46,"Wealth and children are the adornments of the life of this world, but the lasting righteous deeds are better with your Lord in reward and better in hope.",""
  18,47,"And [beware of] the Day when We will move the mountains away, and you will see the earth laid bare<sup>26</sup>; We will gather them all and not leave behind anyone of them.","[26] i.e., flattened."
  18,48,"They will be presented before your Lord in rows, “Now you have come to Us as We created you the first time<sup>27</sup>, although you claimed that We would never appoint a time for your return.”","[27] Nude, uncircumcised, and lonely."
  18,49,"And the record [of deeds] will be placed before them, and you will see the wicked scared of what it contains. They will say, “Woe to us! What is this book that leaves nothing, small or big, except that it has recorded it?” They will find all what they did before them, and your Lord does not wrong anyone.",""
  18,50,"And [remember] when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all prostrated except Iblīs, who was one of the jinn, but he disobeyed the command of his Lord. Will you then take him and his progeny as protectors instead of Me<sup>28</sup>, even though they are your enemies<sup>29</sup>? What a terrible exchange for the wrongdoers!","[28] Demons could possess their idols and communicate through them; they also used to seek refuge from the evil of the jinn by appraising them and slaughtering sacrifices for them.\n [29] Satan along with his fellow demons continues to lead people astray from the right Path."
  18,51,"I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and earth, nor even the creation of their own selves, and I would not take those who misguide others as helpers<sup>30</sup>.","[30] Allah, the source of guidance, would not take false deities who are the main cause of misguidance as helpers."
  18,52,"And [beware of] the Day when He will say, “Call upon those whom you claimed to be My partners.” So they will call them, but they will not respond to them<sup>31</sup>, and We will make them share the same doom.","[31] The false deities they took besides Allah will let them down when they need them most on Judgment Day."
  18,53,"The wicked will see the Fire and realize that they are bound to fall into it, and they will find no escape from it.",""
