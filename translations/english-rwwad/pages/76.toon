quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,195,"Their Lord responded to them: “I will never waste the deeds of any doer among you, male or female; you are the same in reward<sup>92</sup>. Those who migrated and were driven out of their homes and suffered for My sake, and fought and were killed – I will surely expiate their sins and admit them into gardens under which rivers flow, a reward from Allah; with Allah is the best reward.”","[92] Both men and women are born of each other and are looked upon equally."
  3,196,"Do not be deceived by the disbelievers’ prosperity in the land:",""
  3,197,"it is a brief enjoyment, then Hell will be their abode. What a terrible resting place!",""
  3,198,"But for those who fear their Lord will be gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever – a welcoming gift from Allah; and what is with Allah is best for the righteous.",""
  3,199,"There are some among the People of the Book who believe in Allah and what has been sent down to you and what was sent down to them; humbling themselves before Allah. They do not sell Allah’s verses for a small price. It is they who will have their reward with their Lord. Indeed, Allah is swift in reckoning.",""
  3,200,"O you who believe, be patient and endure<sup>93</sup>, stand on guard<sup>94</sup><sup>95</sup> and fear Allah, so that you may be successful.","[93] In the face of life’s trials and tribulations.\n [94] When you face your enemy in battle.\n [95] Rābitū from ribāt, i.e., the fact of ‘tying up’ one’s war steed at outposts to protect the borders from enemy attack."
