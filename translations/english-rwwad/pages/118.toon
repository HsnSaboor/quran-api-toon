  5,60,"Say, “Shall I inform you of those who deserve a worse punishment from Allah? Those who have been cursed by Allah and incurred His wrath, and He turned them into monkeys and pigs, and devil<sup>52</sup> worshipers. Such are far worse in position and farther astray from the straight path.”","[52] Tāghūt: See footnote 2:256."

  5,64,"The Jews say, “Allah’s Hand is restrained.” Their hands have been restrained<sup>53</sup> and they have been cursed for what they say. Rather, His both Hands are wide open, spending as He pleases<sup>54</sup>. What has been sent down to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief. We have cast among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindle the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it. They strive to spread corruption in the land, and Allah does not like those who spread corruption.","[53] Implying inability to give or stinginess.\n [54] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Indeed, the Right Hand of Allah is full, and spending cannot diminish it. It incessantly spends day and night. Suppose how much He must have spent since He created the heavens and earth, yet that did not decrease anything of what is in His Right Hand” [Al-Bukhārī: 7419, Muslim: 993]"
