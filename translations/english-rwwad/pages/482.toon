quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  41,47,"The knowledge of the Hour is with Him alone. No fruit emerges from its husk, nor does any female conceive or give birth without His knowledge. On the Day when He will call them, “Where are My [alleged] partners?” They will say, “We declare before you that none of us can bear witness to that.”",""
  41,48,"Whatever they used to supplicate before will vanish from them, and they will realize that they have no escape.",""
  41,49,"Man never tires of asking for good, but if evil touches him, he is desperate and despondent.",""
  41,50,"But if We give him a taste of mercy from Us after being inflicted with adversity, he will surely say, “This is my due<sup>21</sup>, and I do not think that the Hour will ever come, but if I am brought back to my Lord, I will surely have with Him the best [reward].” We will surely inform the disbelievers of what they did, and We will surely make them taste a harsh punishment.","[21] For I deserve it for my effort, knowledge, excellence, etc."
  41,51,"When We bestow favor upon man, he turns away and distances himself [from Us]; but when evil touches him, he is full of prolonged supplication.",""
  41,52,"Say, “Did you ever consider, if this [Qur’an] is really from Allah, but you reject it, who can be more astray than someone who is in extreme defiance?”",""
  41,53,"We will show them Our signs in the universe and in their own selves until it becomes clear to them that this [Qur’an] is the truth<sup>22</sup>. Is it not enough that your Lord is a Witness over all things?","[22] Or that He is the Truth."
  41,54,"Indeed, they are in doubt concerning the meeting with their Lord; He truly encompasses all things.",""
