quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,171,"And [remember] when We raised the mountain over them as if it were a dark cloud, and they thought that it would fall upon them, “Hold fast to what We have given you<sup>70</sup> and observe its teachings, so that you may fear Allah.”","[70] For their persistent rebellion and disobedience."
  7,172,"And [remember] when your Lord brought forth from the loins of the children of Adam their offspring and made them testify about themselves [asking], “Am I not your Lord?” They said, “Yes indeed; We testify<sup>71</sup>.” [We did so] lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, “We were unaware of this,”","[71] This is alluding to the ‘mīthāq al-fitrah’ (the pledge of innate nature)."
  7,173,"Or that you say, “It was our forefathers before us who associated partners with Allah, and we are their offspring who came after them. Will you then destroy us for the falsehood that they invented?”",""
  7,174,"This is how We make the verses clear, so that they may return.",""
  7,175,"And relate to them [O Prophet] the story of the one<sup>72</sup> whom We gave knowledge of Our revelations, but he abandoned it, so Satan took hold of him and he became one of the deviants.","[72] A man from the Children of Israel at the time of Moses."
  7,176,"If We had willed, We could have elevated him thereby<sup>73</sup>, but he clung to the [life of the] earth<sup>74</sup> and followed his desires. His likeness is that of a dog: if you attack it, it pants with its tongue lolling, and if you leave it, it still pants<sup>75</sup>. Such is the example of the people who reject Our revelations. Therefore, relate the stories, so that they may reflect.","[73] i.e., by the knowledge of the revelations. \n [74] i.e., its worldly pleasures.\n [75] No matter whether they are admonished or not, they will not believe."
  7,177,"How evil is the likeness of people who rejected Our verses, and it is themselves that they have wronged.",""
  7,178,"Whoever Allah guides is rightly guided; and whoever He causes to stray<sup>76</sup>, it is they who are the losers.","[76] Due to persistence in evil and rejecting the truth."
