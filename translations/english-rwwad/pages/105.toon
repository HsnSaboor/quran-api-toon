quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,171,"O People of the Book, do not go to extremes in your religion, and do not say about Allah but the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah, and His Word that He bestowed upon Mary, and a spirit<sup>110</sup> from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers and do not say “Three” [i.e., Trinity]. Cease; that is better for you. Indeed, Allah is the only One God. Glory be to Him, [far exalted is He] to have a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, and sufficient is Allah as a Disposer of Affairs.","[110] That is, Jesus’s spirit was created by Allah. [Ibn Kathīr, al-Sa‘dī]. Al-Baghawī says: “He (Jesus) is a soul just like any other soul but Allah added him to Himself to honor him”. Al-Shawkānī is also of this opinion. Al-Alūsī says: “Because Jesus was created by a blow (of air), not by a drop (of sperm), he was called a ‘soul’.” The Qur’an makes it clear that Jesus is just like all other human beings, whose spirit was created by Allah."
  4,172,"The Messiah would never disdain to be a slave of Allah, nor would the nearest angels to Him. Those who disdain to worship Him and are arrogant, He will gather them all together before Him.",""
  4,173,"As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, He will give them their rewards in full and will increase them out of His bounty. But those who disdain and act arrogantly, He will subject them to a painful punishment, and they will not find for themselves any protector or helper besides Allah.",""
  4,174,"O people, there has come to you conclusive evidence<sup>111</sup> from your Lord, and We have sent down to you a clear light<sup>112</sup>.","[111] i.e., Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ).\n [112] i.e., the Qur’an which guides people to the straight path as if they walk in its light."
  4,175,"As for those who believe in Allah and hold fast to Him, He will admit them into His mercy and grace<sup>113</sup>, and guide them to Himself through a straight path.","[113] i.e., Paradise."
