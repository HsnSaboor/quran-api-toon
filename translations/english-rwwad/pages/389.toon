  28,29,"When Moses had completed the term<sup>13</sup> and was traveling with his family, he spotted a fire in the direction of Mount Tūr. He said to his family<sup>14</sup>, “Stay here; I have spotted a fire. Perhaps I will bring you from there some news or a brand of fire so that you may warm yourselves.”","[13] Moses completed the ten years term instead of eight years.\n [14] From Midian to Egypt."
  28,30,"But when he came to it, he was called from the tree<sup>15</sup> in the sacred ground on the right side of the valley: “O Moses, I am Allah, the Lord of the worlds.","[15] Which was within the fire."
  28,31,"Throw down your staff.” But when he saw it slithering as if it were a snake, he turned and ran away without looking back. [Allah said], “O Moses, come back, and have no fear; you are perfectly safe.",""
  28,32,"Put your hand into your garment, it will come out shining white without blemish, and draw your arms tight to you to calm your fear. These are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs, for they are indeed a rebellious people.”",""
