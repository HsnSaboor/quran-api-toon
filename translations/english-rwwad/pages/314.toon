Then you killed a man [by mistake]<sup>11</sup>, but We saved you from distress, and We put you through several trials. You stayed among the people of Midian for several years, then you came [here] at a destined time, O Moses.","[10] Because Moses had refused all wet-nurses who were brought to nurse him beforehand.\n [11] The Coptic person died after Moses struck him."
