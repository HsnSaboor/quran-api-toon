  7,131,"When prosperity came their way, they said, “This is what we deserve<sup>45</sup>,” but when adversity befell them, they ascribed it to the misfortune of Moses and those who were with him. Indeed, their misfortune is decreed by Allah, but most of them do not know.","[45] Out of egotism and smugness, they felt they deserved all good things."
  7,132,"They said, “No matter what sign you may bring to enchant us, we are not going to believe in you.”",""
  7,133,"So We sent upon them flood, locusts, lice, frogs and blood – as clear signs, yet they persisted in arrogance and were a wicked people.",""
  7,134,"When a scourge befell them, they said, “O Moses, call upon your Lord for us by virtue of the covenant He has made to you; if you remove the scourge from us, we will surely believe in you and will let the Children of Israel go with you.”",""
  7,135,"But when We removed the scourge from them until an appointed term that they were bound to reach, they broke their promise.",""
  7,136,"So We subjected them to retribution and drowned them in the sea because they rejected Our signs and were heedless of them.",""
  7,137,"And We made the people who had been oppressed to inherit the lands of the east and west that We had blessed. The good word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of what they endured patiently, and We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people used to make and what they used to construct.",""
