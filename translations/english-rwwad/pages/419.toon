quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  33,7,"And [remember] when We took from the prophets their covenant and from you [O Prophet], and from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, son of Mary; We took from them a solemn covenant",""
  33,8,"so that He may question the truthful<sup>6</sup> about their truthfulness, and He has prepared for the disbelievers a painful punishment.","[6] i.e., so that He may ask the ""prophets"" what they conveyed and what response they received. The ""truthful"" may also refer to those who believed in the prophets’ message and imparted it to others."
  33,9,"O you who believe, remember Allah’s favor upon you when [enemy] forces came against you<sup>7</sup>, but We sent against them a violent wind and forces that you could not see<sup>8</sup>. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.","[7] This is referring to what is known as the Battle of the Trench or the Confederates which occurred in 5 A.H./627 C.E., where the pagans of Makkah along with some Arab and Jewish tribes (totaling around 10,000 soldiers) besieged Madinah, and the Prophet (ﷺ) positioned around 3000 soldiers to defend Madinah. The Prophet (ﷺ) had anticipated the offense and, upon advice from one of his companions, Salmān from Persia, dug a trench around the city to protect it from the invaders. After several attempts to cross the trench, the Allied forces lost morale and were forced to end the siege due to severe weather conditions. By this Allah saved Muslims from the machination of the non-Muslim allied forces to destroy the newly-born Islamic community in Madinah.\n [8] i.e., the angles."
  33,10,"[Remember] when they came upon you from above you and from below you<sup>9</sup>, and your eyes grew wild [in horror], and the hearts reached the throats, and you began to entertain various thoughts about Allah<sup>10</sup>.","[9] i.e., those coming from Najd and Khaybar came from above and those coming from Makkah came from below you.\n [10] i.e., sometimes expecting victory and other times going desperate."
  33,11,"There the believers were tested and were severely shaken.",""
  33,12,"And [remember] when the hypocrites and those with sickness in their hearts said, “Allah and His Messenger did not promise us but delusion!”",""
  33,13,"And [remember] when a group of them said, “O people of Yathrib<sup>11</sup>, you cannot withstand [the enemy attack], so go back.” Another group of them asked the Prophet’s permission to leave, saying, “Our homes are exposed,” even though they were not exposed; they only wanted to flee.","[11] This was the name of Madīnah prior to the arrival of the Prophet (ﷺ)."
  33,14,"If the enemy were to enter the town upon them<sup>12</sup> from all sides, and they were asked to abandon faith, they would have done it and would not have shown hesitation in it except a little.","[12] i.e., upon the hypocrites."
  33,15,"They had already made a covenant with Allah earlier that they would not turn and flee, and the covenant of Allah will surely be questioned about.",""
