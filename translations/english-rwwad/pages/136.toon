quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,69,"Those who fear Allah are in no way accountable for them; their duty is only to remind, so that they may abstain [from mockery].",""
  6,70,"Leave those who take their religion as play and amusement, and are deluded by the life of this world. But admonish them with this [Qur’an], so no soul should be ruined for its misdeeds – having no protector or intercessor other than Allah. Even if they were to offer every form of ransom, it would not be accepted. Such are the ones who will be ruined for their misdeeds. They will have scalding water to drink and a painful punishment for their disbelief.",""
  6,71,"Say, “Shall we invoke<sup>22</sup> besides Allah that which can neither benefit nor harm us, and shall we turn back to disbelief after being guided by Allah? Just like the one whom devils have tempted in the land leaving him bewildered, although he has companions inviting him to guidance<sup>23</sup>, “Come to us.” Say, “Allah’s guidance is the [true] guidance, and we are commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds,","[22] i.e., worship.\n [23] The example given is of one who lost his way and is further confused by evil ones, tempting him to follow various directions, all leading to destruction; although his sincere friends call him to the right direction, but he ignores them."
  6,72,"and to establish prayer and fear Him, for it is He to Whom you will all be gathered.",""
  6,73,"It is He Who created the heavens and earth for a true purpose. On the Day [of Resurrection] He will say, “Be,” and it will be. His word is the truth. His is the dominion on the Day the Trumpet will be blown. He is the Knower of the unseen and the seen, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Aware.”",""
