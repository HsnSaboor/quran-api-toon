quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  22,73,"O people, a similitude is set forth, so listen to it: those whom you invoke besides Allah can never create even a fly, even if they all come together for that. And if a fly snatches something away from them, they cannot retrieve it. How feeble is the invoker as well as the invoked<sup>38</sup>!","[38] i.e., How feeble are the seekers of the fly and how feeble is the fly!"
  22,74,"They have not revered Allah the reverence He deserves<sup>39</sup>. Indeed, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.","[39] Because they worshiped others besides Him Almighty."
  22,75,"Allah chooses messengers from the angels and from mankind. Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.",""
  22,76,"He knows all that is ahead of them and all that is behind them<sup>40</sup>, and to Allah returns all matters.","[40] Allah's knowledge encompasses every aspect of His creations in the past, present and future."
  22,77,"O you who believe, bow down and prostrate, worship Your Lord and do good, so that you may succeed.",""
  22,78,"Strive in the cause of Allah in a due manner. He has chosen you and has not imposed upon you any hardship in religion – the faith of your father Abraham. He named you as Muslims earlier and in this [Qur’an] so that the Messenger might be a witness over you and you might be witnesses over mankind. So establish prayer, give zakah, and hold fast to Allah, for He is your Protector; what an excellent Protector and an excellent Helper!",""
