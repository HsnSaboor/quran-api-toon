quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  24,28,"If you do not find anyone therein, do not enter it until you have been given permission. If you are told to go back, then go back; that is more proper for you. And Allah is All-Knowing of what you do.",""
  24,29,"There is no blame on you if you enter uninhabited houses with a useful purpose<sup>17</sup>. And Allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal.","[17] Such as taking rest, shelter, or one's personal belongings, etc."
  24,30,"Tell the believing men to lower their gazes and guard their private parts<sup>18</sup>; that is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of what they do.","[18] From being seen and from unlawful acts."
  24,31,"Tell the believing women to lower their gazes and guard their private parts, and not to reveal their beauty<sup>19</sup> except what appears<sup>20</sup>. And let them draw their veils over their chests, and not to reveal their beauty<sup>21</sup> except to their husbands, their fathers, their fathers-in-law, their sons, their stepsons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons or sisters’ sons, their fellow women, slaves whom they own, male attendants who have no [sexual] desire<sup>22</sup>, or children who are still unaware of private aspects of women. Nor let them stamp their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden charm. And turn to Allah in repentance all together, O believers, so that you may be successful.","[19] Both natural beauty such as hair and body shape, and other beauty such as clothing, jewelry, etc. [20] i.e., outer garments, etc. [21] i.e., hair, neck, arms, legs, etc.\n [22] An abnormal condition where a man is devoid of sexual feelings."
