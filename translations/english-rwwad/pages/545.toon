quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  58,22,"You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day taking as allies those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their parents, their children, their brothers, or their kindred. It is they in whose hearts Allah has instilled faith and strengthened them with a spirit<sup>9</sup> from Him. He will admit them to gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Allah. They are the party of Allah. Indeed, it is the party of Allah that will be successful.","[9] Spirit here means His revelation, light, or His help."
  59,1,"All that is in the heavens and all that is on earth glorifies Allah, for He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.",""
  59,2,"It is He Who expelled the disbelievers of the People of the Book<sup>1</sup> from their homes as the first banishment<sup>2</sup>. You did not think that they would leave, and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from Allah. But [the punishment of] Allah came upon them from where they did not expect and He cast dread in their hearts, destroying their homes with their own hands<sup>3</sup> and the hands of the believers. So take a lesson, O you people of insight.","[1] It refers to the Jews of Banū Nadīr, who broke their pact with the Prophet (ﷺ).\n [2] This was the first time ever that they were gathered and expelled from Madinah to the Levant.\n [3] In order that the believers do not benefit from their homes."
  59,3,"Had Allah not decreed exile for them, He would have surely punished them in this world. And in the Hereafter, there will be for them the punishment of the Fire.",""
