quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,109,"On the Day when Allah will gather the messengers and say, “What response did you receive?” They will say, “We have no knowledge. You alone are the All-Knower of all unseen.”",""
  5,110,"Then Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favor upon you and upon your mother when I supported you with the Holy Spirit – as you spoke to people in the cradle and in maturity. I taught you writing, wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel. You made something from clay in the shape of a bird by My permission and breathed into it, and it became a bird by My permission. You healed the born-blind and lepers by My permission, and you brought the dead to life by My permission. I restrained the Children of Israel from [killing] you when you came to them with clear signs, but the disbelievers among them said, “This is nothing but clear magic.”",""
  5,111,"And [remember] when I inspired the disciples, “Believe in Me and in My messenger [i.e., Jesus].” They said, “We believe, and bear witness that we submit to Allah [as Muslims].”",""
  5,112,"And [remember] when the disciples said, “O Jesus, son of Mary, can your Lord<sup>72</sup> send down to us a table [spread with food] from the heaven?” He said, “Fear Allah, if you are believers.”","[72] i.e., will Allah consent to (Allah's ability is undoubted)."
  5,113,"They said, “We wish to eat from it and let our hearts be reassured and to know that you told us the truth, and to be witnesses to it.”",""
