quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,164,"When a group of them said, “Why are you admonishing a people whom Allah will destroy or punish severely?” They said, “To excuse ourselves before your Lord, and perhaps they may fear Allah.”",""
  7,165,"When they ignored the admonition they were given, We saved those who forbade evil and seized the wrongdoers with a grievous punishment for their defiant disobedience.",""
  7,166,"When they persistently violated what they were forbidden to do, We said to them, “Be despised apes<sup>64</sup>.”","[64] Their deed was deceptive, only outwardly resembling observance of Allah’s commands. As such, Allah turned them into apes, only outwardly resembling humans, but were actually far apart from real humans."
  7,167,"And [remember] when your Lord declared that He would send against them those who would afflict them with a terrible punishment<sup>65</sup> until the Day of Resurrection. Your Lord is Swift in Punishment, but He also is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","[65] This is for their constantly disparaging their pledge with Allah."
  7,168,"We scattered them<sup>66</sup> through the land in communities – some of them were righteous and others were less so. We tested them with both prosperity and adversity, so that they would return [to Allah’s Obedience].","[66] This is an allusion to the Jewish Diaspora and their dispersion out of their lands. See 17:4-8."
  7,169,"They were then succeeded by other generations who inherited the Scripture, opting for the lowly gains<sup>67</sup>, and saying, “We will be forgiven<sup>68</sup>.” Yet if a similar gain<sup>69</sup> comes their way, they will seize it. Was not a covenant of the Scripture taken from them that they should not say about Allah except the truth, and they had studied its teachings? But the Home of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah. Do you not understand?","[67] i.e., unlawful gains and pleasures.\n [68] It demonstrates how self-justifying they were in sticking to their devious ways.\n [69] i.e., a similar temptation."
  7,170,"As for those who hold fast to the Scripture and establish prayer, We will not let the reward of those who seek righteousness to be lost.",""
