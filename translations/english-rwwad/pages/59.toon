quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,71,"O People of the Book, why do you mix the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth knowingly?",""
  3,72,"A faction of the People of the Book says, “Believe in what has been sent down to the believers in the morning and reject it in the evening, so that they may return [from their faith]<sup>30</sup>.","[30] They hatched the plot of claiming to embrace Faith, only to disclaim it as untrue shortly thereafter, in order to sow the seed of doubt in the minds of the believers and thus abandon their religion."
  3,73,"And do not believe in anyone except those who follow your religion.” Say, “The guidance is the guidance of Allah.” [They say,] Lest someone may be given similar to what you have been given or argue with you before your Lord<sup>31</sup>. Say, “All bounty is in the Hand of Allah; He grants it to whom He wills. And Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.”","[31] They fear that if people know what their Books really say, they would be on an equal footing with them, or that it be used as an argument against them."
  3,74,"He chooses for His mercy whom He wills; for Allah is the Possessor of great bounty.”",""
  3,75,"And among the People of the Book are some who, if you entrust with a heap of gold, will return it to you; yet there are others who, if you entrust with a single coin of gold, will not return it to you unless you keep standing over them. This is because they say, “We are under no obligation towards the Gentiles<sup>32</sup>.” And they tell lies about Allah knowingly.","[32] The Jews do not consider it a sin to cheat or lie to a gentile, i.e., a non-Jew."
  3,76,"But those who fulfill their covenant and fear Allah, surely Allah loves those who fear Him.",""
  3,77,"Those who trade the covenant of Allah and their oaths<sup>33</sup> for a small price, they will have no share in the Hereafter. Allah will neither speak to them, nor look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and for them there will be a painful punishment.","[33] This covenant and oath is detailed in verse 81 below; that is, to believe in the prophethood of Muhammad (ﷺ) and support him."
