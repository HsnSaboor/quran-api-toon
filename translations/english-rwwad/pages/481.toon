quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  41,39,"And among His signs is that you see the land withered, but when We send down rain upon it, it stirs and swells. He Who gives it life will surely give life to the dead, for He is Most Capable of all things.",""
  41,40,"Those who seek to cause deviation in Our verses<sup>16</sup> are not hidden from Us. Is one who will be cast into the Fire better or one who will come safely on the Day of Resurrection? Do whatever you wish, for He is All-Seeing of what you do.","[16] By denying them, distorting their meanings, preferring deviant interpretation, or making noise while they are recited as the pagans of Makkah used to do."
  41,41,"Those who disbelieve in the Reminder<sup>17</sup> when it comes to them [will be punished], for it is truly a mighty Book<sup>18</sup>.","[17] i.e., the Qur’an.\n [18] Inimitable and protected by Allah from any distortion or alteration."
  41,42,"No falsehood can approach it from the front or from behind; a revelation from the One Who is All-Wise, Praiseworthy.",""

  41,44,"If We had made it a non-Arabic Qur’an, they would have said, “If only its verses were made clear? What! A non-Arabic [book] and an Arab [messenger]?” Say, “It is a guidance and healing for those who believe. As for those who do not believe, there is deafness in their ears and they are blind to [understand] it – it is as if they are being called from a far-off place<sup>19</sup>.”","[19] So they neither hear the call nor understand it."
  41,45,"We gave Moses the Scripture, but differences arose concerning it. Were it not for a prior decree<sup>20</sup> from your Lord, it would have been judged between them. Surely they are in a disquieting doubt about it.","[20] That Allah will delay their judgment until Judgment Day."
  41,46,"Whoever does a righteous deed, it is to his own benefit; and whoever does an evil deed, it is to his own loss. Your Lord is not unjust to His slaves.",""
