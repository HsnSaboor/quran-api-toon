  40,78,"We have sent messengers before you; of them are some whose stories We have told you, and some We have not. It was not for a messenger to bring a sign except with Allah’s permission. But when the decree of Allah comes, judgment will be passed with justice, thereupon the people of falsehood will be in utter loss.",""

  40,85,"But their faith was of no benefit to them when they saw Our punishment. This has always been Allah’s way with His slaves; whereupon the disbelievers were in utter loss.",""
