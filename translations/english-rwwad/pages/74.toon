  3,181,"Allah has heard the words of those who said, “Allah is poor and we are rich<sup>89</sup>!” We will write down what they said and their killing of the prophets unjustly, and We will say, “Taste the punishment of the burning Fire.","[89] Al-Hasan al-Basrī reports that when the Jews of Madinah heard the previous verse, encouraging believers to spend in the way of Allah, they said: “If He asks people to spend in His way to achieve His goals, then He must be a wretched pauper!” [al-Tabarī, Ibn Kathīr, al-Qurtubī]"
  3,182,"That is because of what your hands have sent forth, for Allah is not unjust to [His] slaves.”",""
  3,183,"They said, “Allah has commanded us not to believe in any messenger until he brings us an offering consumed by the fire.” Say, “There came to you messengers before me with clear proofs and with what you demanded. Then why did you kill them, if you are truthful?”",""

  3,185,"Every soul will taste death, and you will be paid your reward in full on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is spared from the Fire and admitted into Paradise has truly won, for the life of this world is nothing but an illusory pleasure.",""
  3,186,"You will certainly be tested in your wealth and in yourselves, and you will certainly hear from those who were given the Scripture before you and from those who associate partners with Allah many abusive words. But if you observe patience and fear Allah, that is a matter of firm resolve.",""
