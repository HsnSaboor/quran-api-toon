quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,55,"So do not let their wealth or their children impress you; Allah only intends to punish them through these things in the life of this world and to let their souls depart while they are still disbelievers.",""
  9,56,"They swear by Allah that they belong to you<sup>51</sup>, but they do not belong to you; rather they are a people who are afraid [of you].","[51] In their precarious situation, they lie as a line of defence."
  9,57,"If they could find a refuge, caves, or a place to hide, they would rush headlong to it<sup>52</sup>.","[52] A vividly depiction of their life of constant distress and anguish."
  9,58,"There are some among them who criticize you [O Prophet] concerning alms<sup>53</sup>; if they are given something thereof, they are pleased, but if they are not given, they are enraged.","[53] The hypocrites would insinuate that the noble Messenger (ﷺ) was not fair in dividing zakah revenues."
  9,59,"If only they had been pleased with that which Allah and His Messenger gave them, and said, “Allah is sufficient for us; Allah will give us out of His bounty, and so will His Messenger; to Allah alone we turn with hope.”",""
  9,60,"Alms [i.e., zakah] is only for the poor and the needy; those in charge of it; those whose hearts may be attracted [to Islam]; for freeing those in bondage; for those in debt; for the cause of Allah; and for [the stranded] traveler<sup>54</sup> – as ordained by Allah, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.","[54] See 2:83, 2:273."
  9,61,"Among those [hypocrites] are some who offend the Prophet and say, “He listens to everyone<sup>55</sup>.” Say [O Prophet], “He listens to what is best for you<sup>56</sup>; he believes in Allah, trusts the believers, and is a mercy for those of you who believe.” But for those who offend the Messenger of Allah, there will be a painful punishment.","[55] i.e., he believes everything he hears.\n [56] i.e., he listens but to what is good and not to evil; he listens and overlooks; he turns a blind eye when you come with fabrications."
