quran[14]{c,v,t,f}:
  43,34,"and their houses having [silver] doors and couches on which they recline,",""
  43,35,"and [golden] ornaments. But all of these are mere enjoyments of the life of this world, and the Hereafter with your Lord is [only] for those who fear Allah.",""
  43,36,"Whoever turns away from the Reminder of the Most Compassionate [i.e., the Qur’an], We assign to him a devil to be his close associate,",""
  43,37,"who will surely avert them from the [right] way, while they think that they are rightly guided.",""
  43,38,"Then when he comes to Us, he will say [to his devil associate], “I wish you were as distant from me as the East and West. What a terrible associate [you were]!”",""
  43,39,"[They will be told], “As you have done wrong, it will not benefit you Today that you are sharing the punishment<sup>14</sup>.”","[14] In the life of this world, it is comforting to many people when they hear that others also went through similar trials. However, this will not be the case on Judgment Day, as everyone will be desperate to save themselves, regardless of what happens to others."
  43,40,"Can you make the deaf hear, or guide the blind or the one who is clearly misguided?",""
  43,41,"Either We take you away [in death], We will surely exact retribution upon them,",""

  43,45,"Ask those of Our messengers whom We sent before you: Did We appoint gods to be worshiped besides the Most Compassionate?",""
  43,46,"Indeed, We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his courtiers, so he said: “I am a messenger of the Lord of the worlds.”",""
  43,47,"But as soon as he came to them with Our signs, they laughed at them.",""
