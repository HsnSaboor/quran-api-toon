quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,141,"[These hypocrites are] those who are waiting and watching<sup>96</sup> to see what happens to you. If Allah grants you victory, they say, “Were we not with you?” But if the disbelievers have some partial [victory], they say, “Did we not take care of you and protect you from the believers?” But Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection<sup>97</sup>, and Allah will never give the disbelievers a way to [overcome] the believers.","[96] They are spying and employing all means of devious wiles and ploys to demoralize the believers. [97] In the Hereafter, but possibly in this world as well."
  4,142,"The hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but it is He Who deceives them. Whenever they stand up for prayer, they stand up reluctantly, only to be seen by people<sup>98</sup>, and they do not remember Allah but a little,","[98] This is because what is in their minds is not to please Allah, but rather to please other mortals."
  4,143,"wavering in between, neither belonging to these [believers], nor to those [disbelievers]<sup>99</sup>. Whomsoever Allah causes to stray, you will never find a way [to guidance] for him.","[99] The hypocrites live in a state of perpetual doubt and constant perplexity, so they are always experiencing a state of dilemma."
  4,144,"O you who believe, do not take the disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Do you want to give Allah a clear proof against yourselves?",""
  4,145,"Indeed, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire<sup>100</sup>, and you will never find for them any helper,","[100] The Prophet (ﷺ) described four characteristics of a hypocrite: 1. Whenever he is entrusted, he betrays. 2. Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie. 3. Whenever he makes a covenant, he proves treacherous. 4. Whenever he quarrels, he behaves in an insulting manner."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 33]. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""The worst people before Allah on the Day of Judgment will be the double-faced people who appear to some people with one face and to other people with another face."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 84]"
  4,146,"except those who repent and mend their ways, and hold fast to Allah and devote their religion sincerely to Allah; it is they who will be with the believers, and Allah will give the believers a great reward.",""
  4,147,"Why would Allah punish you, if you are grateful and faithful? Allah is ever Appreciative, All-Knowing.",""
