quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,265,"And the likeness of those who spend their wealth, seeking the pleasure of Allah and fortifying their own souls, is that of a garden on a fertile hill<sup>161</sup>; if it is hit by a downpour, it yields double its harvest. And if it is not hit by a downpour, then a drizzle is sufficient. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.","[161] Gardens and farms on elevated land are more fertile than lower placed ones. This is the analogy Allah draws of the charity of the sincere. No matter how much it is, it grows and prospers."
  2,266,"Would any of you wish to have an orchard of date palms and grapevines, under which rivers flow, full of all kinds of fruits; but he grew old and had feeble young children, then it is hit by a fiery whirlwind, burning it all<sup>162</sup>? This is how Allah makes the verses clear to you so that you may reflect.","[162] Those who follow their charity by taunting and hurting the recipient’s feelings, thus rendering their charity void. ‘Umar (رضي الله عنه) said, ""This is an example of a rich man who does good deeds out of obedience to Allah, and then Allah sends him Satan whereupon he commits sins till all his good deeds are lost."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 62]"
  2,267,"O you who believe, spend in charity from the good things you have earned and of what We have produced for you from the earth<sup>163</sup>. Do not choose inferior things for charity, which you yourselves would not take except by overlooking. And know that Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.","[163] Crops and minerals."
  2,268,"Satan threatens you with poverty<sup>164</sup> and orders you to commit shameful acts<sup>165</sup>, but Allah promises you forgiveness and bounty from Him. And Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.","[164] If you spend your money in charity.\n [165] Ibn al-Qayyim says: “Exegetes unanimously agree that al-fahshā’ here means miserliness” [Tarīq al-Hijratayn, p. 375]."
  2,269,"He gives wisdom to whom He wills<sup>166</sup>, and whoever is given wisdom is surely given abundant good, but none will take heed except people of understanding.","[166] The knowledge and understanding of the religion and of the Qur’an."
