quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,191,"And fight them wherever you find them<sup>89</sup>, and drive them out from where they drove you out<sup>90</sup>, for persecution<sup>91</sup> is far worse than fighting. But do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque unless they fight you there. However, if they fight you, then fight them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.","[89] i.e., the disbelievers who raised arms against you. [90] i.e., the land of Makkah from which the Muslims were expelled. [91] Among the meanings of ""fitnah"" are: disbelief and its imposition on others, dissension, trial, and torment."
  2,192,"But if they desist, then Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  2,193,"Fight them until there is no more persecution<sup>92</sup> and religion is only for Allah. But if they desist, let there be no aggression except against the oppressors.","[92] Or disbelief, polytheism, prevention from the way of Allah, etc."
  2,194,"[Battle in] a sacred month<sup>93</sup> is for [aggression committed in] a sacred month, and violations are subject to retribution. So if anyone commits aggression against you, return the aggression against him in the same manner as he showed against you. But fear Allah, and know that Allah is with those who fear Him.","[93] The sacred months: Dhul-Qi‘dah, Dhul-Hijjah, Muharram, and Rajab."
  2,195,"Spend in the way of Allah<sup>94</sup> and do not throw yourselves into destruction<sup>95</sup>, and do good, for Allah loves those who do good.","[94] Raise funds to prepare for a just fight. [95] By not making preparations."
  2,196,"And Complete Hajj and ‘Umrah for Allah. But if you are prevented, then [offer] whatever sacrificial animal is available, and do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal reaches its place of sacrifice. But if anyone among you is sick or has an ailment of the scalp [and had his head shaved], then he must compensate by fasting, charity, or a sacrificial offering<sup>96</sup>. And when you are safe, then if anyone takes a break between ‘Umrah and Hajj, he must offer a sacrifice of whatever animal is available. However, if he cannot afford an offering, he should fast for three days during Hajj and seven days upon his return [home], making ten days in all. This is for those who are not residents of the Sacred Mosque. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is severe in retribution.","[96] Fasting three days, feeding six poor of Haram (sanctified area of Makkah), or slaughtering a sheep or goat and distributing it among the poor of Haram."
