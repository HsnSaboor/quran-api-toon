quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,14,"And from among those who say, “We are Christians,” We took a covenant from them, but they forgot a part of what was enjoined upon them<sup>15</sup>. So We induced hostility and hatred among them<sup>16</sup> until the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will inform them of what they used to do.","[15] Concerning the coming of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) in the Injeel (Gospel).\n [16] Among their various denominations or sects."
  5,15,"O People of the Book, there has come to you Our Messenger, revealing to you much of what you have been concealing of the Scripture, and overlooking much<sup>17</sup>. There has surely come to you from Allah a light and a clear Book,","[17] Of your sin in this regard."
  5,16,"through which Allah guides those who seek His pleasure to the ways of peace<sup>18</sup>, and brings them out of the depths of darkness to the light by His Will, and guides them to a straight path.","[18] i.e., security and well-being in this life; safety from Hellfire and admission into Paradise, the Home of peace (Dār al-Salām) See 10:25."
  5,17,"Those who say, “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary,” have certainly disbelieved<sup>19</sup>. Say, “Who has the power to prevent Allah, if He chose to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, his mother, and all those who are on earth?” To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth and everything between them. He creates what He wills, and Allah is Most Capable of all things.","[19] See footnote 4:171."
