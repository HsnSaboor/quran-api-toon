quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,114,"There is no good in much of their private talks, except for one who enjoins charity<sup>81</sup>, kindness<sup>82</sup>, or reconciliation between people. Anyone who does that, seeking Allah’s pleasure, We will give him a great reward.","[81] By extending to people useful things such as money, knowledge, kindness.\n [82] All that is good and encouraged by Allah."
  4,115,"But whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him, and follows other than the way of the believers, We will leave him to what he has chosen<sup>83</sup>, and burn him in Hell<sup>84</sup>. What a terrible destination!","[83] i.e., make him responsible for his choice. [84] See 3:85."
  4,116,"Allah does not forgive associating partners with Him, but forgives other than that to whom He wills; whoever associates partners with Allah has certainly gone far astray.",""
  4,117,"They call upon none besides Him except female [idols]<sup>85</sup>; they call upon none but a rebellious Satan<sup>86</sup>","[85] Arabs worshiped in the age of ignorance idols with female names, like: Lāt, ‘Uzzā, Manāt. See 53:19-20.\n [86] They only worship false idols because Satan seduced them into this."
  4,118,"whom Allah cursed, who said, “I will surely take hold of a designated portion of Your slaves.",""
  4,119,"And I will surely mislead them and arouse in them false hopes, and will order them to slit the ears of livestock, and will order them to change Allah’s creation<sup>87</sup>.” Whoever takes Satan as a protector instead of Allah has surely suffered a manifest loss.","[87] The Arab idolaters used to cut off the ears of cattle as a sign that such were dedicated to their gods, making them unlawful to eat; calling such cattle bahīrah. By doing so, they followed the path of Satan, not that of Allah Who made the eating of cattle lawful."
  4,120,"[Satan] makes promises to them and arouses in them false hopes, but Satan makes no promises to them except delusion<sup>88</sup>.","[88] “Satan will say [to his followers on the Day or Judgment] after the matter has been settled: “Allah gave you a true promise; I also gave you promise, but I betrayed you...” See 14:22."
  4,121,"It is they whose abode will be Hell, and they will find no escape from it.",""
