  27,37,"Go back to them; we will surely come to them with forces that they cannot resist, and we will surely drive them out therefrom in disgrace, fully humbled<sup>9</sup>.”","[9] In case they refused to submit."

  27,39,"A powerful jinn said, “I will bring it to you before you rise up from your council, and I am strong enough and trustworthy.”",""
  27,40,"But the one who had some knowledge of the scripture<sup>10</sup> said, “I will bring it to you in the blink of your eye.” When he saw it placed before him, he said, “This is a favor of my Lord, to test me whether I will be grateful or ungrateful. Whoever is grateful, it is only for his own good; and whoever is ungrateful, then my Lord is Self-Sufficient, Most Generous.”","[10] i.e., A man of righteousness and knowledge of the scripture who also knew Allah's Magnificent Name (Al-’Ism Al-‘Azam), by Which if supplication was made would be answered."
