quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  48,29,"Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are firm against the disbelievers<sup>20</sup> and compassionate among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking Allah’s grace and pleasure. Their distinguishing sign is on their faces from the effects of prostration. Such is their description in the Torah<sup>21</sup>. And their description in the Gospel is like that of a seed that sprouts its shoot, then makes it strong; then it grows thick and stands straight on its stem<sup>22</sup>, which delights the sowers – so that He may enrage thereby the disbelievers. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds forgiveness and a great reward.","[20] It should be understood in its historical context. Muslims are urged here to be firm with the Arab disbelievers who were at war with Muslims. However, Muslims are encouraged to treat peaceful and non-combatant disbelievers with kindness and fairness. See 60:8-9.\n [21] The description of the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions is mentioned in the previous scriptures. See Deuteronomy 33:1-3. [22] See Matthew 13:3-9, Mark 4:26-28."
  49,1,"O you who believe, do not decide [any matter of importance] before Allah and His Messenger<sup>1</sup>, and fear Allah, for Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.","[1] Show complete obedience to Allah and the Prophet (ﷺ)."
  49,2,"O you who believe, do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor speak loudly to him as you speak loudly to one another<sup>2</sup>, lest your deeds become worthless without you realizing it.","[2] Or do not call him by his name as you call one another; do not call him, ‘O Muhammad.’ rather, call him, ‘O Prophet.’"
  49,3,"Indeed, those who lower their voices in the presence of the Messenger of Allah are those whose hearts Allah has tested for righteousness; for them there is forgiveness and a great reward<sup>3</sup>.","[3] Once the Prophet (ﷺ) was taking a nap in the afternoon when a group of people from the tribe of Bani Tamīm came to see him. They started calling him out loud while standing outside the chambers of his wives."
  49,4,"As for those who call out to you [O Prophet] from behind the chambers, most of them have no understanding.",""
