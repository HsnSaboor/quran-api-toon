quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,102,"They followed what was recited by the devils during the kingdom of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels Hārūt and Mārūt in Babylon. But these two angels did not teach anyone without telling them, “We are only a test, so do not disbelieve.” Yet they would learn from them what would cause separation between a man and his wife. But they could not harm anyone except by Allah’s permission. They would learn what harmed them and did not benefit them, although they already knew that whoever gets into it would not have any share in the Hereafter. How terrible was the price for which they sold themselves, if only they knew!",""
  2,103,"If only they had believed and feared Allah, they would have had a better reward from Allah, if only they knew!",""
  2,104,"O you who believe, do not say, “Rā‘inā,” [i.e., consider our situation!] But say, “Unzhurnā,” [i.e., wait for us!] and listen. And for the disbelievers there will be a painful torment.",""
  2,105,"Neither those who disbelieved from the People of the Book nor the polytheists wish that your Lord sends down any good to you [O Muslims]. But Allah chooses for His mercy whom He wills, for Allah is the possessor of great bounty.",""
