quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,95,"It is Allah Who causes the grain and fruit-stones to sprout. He brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. Such is Allah! So how are you being turned away?",""
  6,96,"It is He Who cleaves the daybreak, and made the night for rest, and the sun and the moon with a precise measurement<sup>31</sup>; that is the design of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.","[31] i.e., their precise movement."
  6,97,"And He made the stars as your guide through the darkness of the land and sea. We have made the signs clear for people who know.",""
  6,98,"It is He Who originated you from a single soul, then assigned for you a place to stay and a place to rest<sup>32</sup>. We have made the signs clear for people who understand.","[32] Mustaqarr, Mustawda‘: i.e., the loins of men, the wombs of women; the surface of earth, the belly of earth after death."
  6,99,"It is He Who sends down water from the sky and We produce thereby vegetation of all kinds. We produce from it greenery from which We bring forth clustered grains. From the spathes of palm trees emerge clusters of dates hanging within reach and gardens of grapevines, olives, and pomegranates – similar [in shape] yet different [in taste]. Look at their fruit when they bear fruit and ripen. Indeed, there are signs in these for people who believe.",""
  6,100,"They regard the jinn as partners of Allah, even though He created them, and they falsely attribute to Him sons and daughters without knowledge. Glorified and Exalted is He far above what they ascribe to Him.",""
  6,101,"He is the Originator of the heavens and earth. How could He have a son when He never had a companion? He created all things, and He is All-Knowing of everything.",""
