quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  58,7,"Do you not see that Allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth? No secret consultation takes place between three, but He is their fourth, or between five, but He is their sixth, or between fewer or more than that, but He is with them wherever they may be<sup>4</sup>. Then He will inform them of what they did on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of everything.","[4] He is with them by His knowledge."
  58,8,"Have you not seen those who were forbidden from holding secret talks, yet they go back to do what they were forbidden from, conspiring in sin and aggression, and in disobedience to the Messenger? When they come to you, they greet you<sup>5</sup> other than the way Allah greets you, and they say to one another, “Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?” Sufficient is Hell for them; they will enter it. What a terrible destination!","[5] This is referring to the Jews who used to play with words while addressing the Prophet (ﷺ) to ridicule him, saying ""Asāmu ‘alaikum"" (death be upon you) instead of ""Asalamu ‘alaikum"" (peace be upon you)."
  58,9,"O you who believe, when you hold secret counsel, do not do so in sin and aggression, and in disobedience to the Messenger, rather do so in righteousness and piety. And fear Allah, to Whom you will be gathered.",""
  58,10,"Secret talks are only prompted by Satan to grieve the believers, but he cannot harm them<sup>6</sup> in the least except with Allah’s permission. So let the believers put their trust in Allah.","[6] Referring to the sinful type of secret talks, as mentioned in the previous verses, or two persons speaking in private in the presence of a third, leading him to assume that he is the subject of their talk."
  58,11,"O you who believe, when you are told to make room in your gatherings, then make room; Allah will give you abundance<sup>7</sup>. And when you are told to rise, then rise; Allah will raise in ranks those who believed from among you and those who are given knowledge. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.","[7] In this life or in the Hereafter."
