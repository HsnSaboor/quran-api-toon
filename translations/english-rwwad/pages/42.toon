quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,253,"Those messengers: We favored some over others. There are some to whom Allah spoke<sup>140</sup>, and some He raised high in rank<sup>141</sup>. To Jesus, son of Mary, We gave clear signs and supported him with the Holy Spirit<sup>142</sup>. If Allah had willed, those who came after them would not have fought one another after receiving clear signs. But they differed – some believed and some disbelieved. If Allah had willed, they would not have fought one another, but Allah does what He wills.","[140] Such as Moses (عليه السلام). [141] Such as Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ).\n [142] Miracles and the Evangel (Gospel)."
  2,254,"O you who believe, spend from what We have provided for you before there comes a day when there will be no trading, friendship, or intercession. It is the disbelievers who are the wrongdoers.",""
  2,255,"Allah: none has the right to be worshiped except Him, the Ever-Living<sup>143</sup>, All-Sustaining<sup>144</sup>. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep<sup>145</sup>. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth. Who is there that can intercede with Him except with His permission? He knows what was before them and what will be after them<sup>146</sup>, while they encompass nothing of His knowledge, except what He wills. His Kursī<sup>147</sup> [i.e., footstool] extends over the heavens and earth, and safeguarding of both does not weary Him, for He is the Most High<sup>148</sup>, the Most Great<sup>149</sup>.<sup>150</sup>","[143] Whose life is perfect, complete, and eternal, without beginning or end.\n [144] Dependent on none for His existence while being the sustainer of all created beings.\n [145] Dozing off and falling asleep are but normal to all creation that are inherently frail.\n [146] Allah's knowledge encompasses every aspect of His creations in the past, present and future.\n [147] Chair or footstool. It is not to be confused with al-‘Arsh (the Throne), which is infinitely higher and greater than al-Kursī.\n [148] Above all of His creations and superior to them in essence, rank, and position.\n [149] Whose greatness is unlimited, beyond description or imagination.\n [150] This verse is known as Āyat al-Kursī, lit. The verse of the Footstool. It is the greatest verse in the Qur’an."
  2,256,"There is no compulsion in religion<sup>151</sup>; the truth has been made distinct from falsehood. Whoever rejects Tāghoot <sup>152</sup>[i.e., false gods] and believes in Allah, has indeed grasped the strong handhold that never breaks<sup>153</sup>. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.","[151] This is a great Islamic principle whereby no one is to be coerced to believe, but it is the duty of the believers to make sure that people know what is right and what is wrong.\n [152] False objects of worship, such as devils, idols, stones, sun, stars, angels, saints, graves, rulers, etc.\n [153] This verse immediately follows Āyat al-Kursī for good reason, as the previous verse contains clear proofs of the Oneness and Greatness of Allah, which purges Godliness from all that are worshiped besides Allah (Tāghoot)."
