  5,46,"And in their footsteps<sup>44</sup> We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah that came before him, and We gave him the Gospel that contained guidance and light, confirming what came before it in the Torah; and guidance and admonition for the righteous.","[44] i.e., following the tradition of the prophets of the Children of Israel."
  5,47,"Let the people of the Gospel judge according to what Allah has revealed therein. Whoever does not judge according to what Allah has revealed, it is they who are the rebellious.",""
  5,48,"We have revealed to you [O Prophet] the Book in truth, confirming the scriptures that came before it and as a criterion<sup>45</sup> over them. So judge between them according to what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires in disregard of the truth that has come to you. To each of you We have ordained a law and a way of life<sup>46</sup>. If Allah had willed, He would have made you a single community, but He tests you in what He has given you. So compete with one another in doing good deeds. To Allah you will all return, then He will inform you concerning things over which you used to differ.","[45] Muhaymin: that which testifies the truth therein and falsifies the falsehood added to them.\n [46] A fact borne out by millennia that non-Muslim societies (known as dhimmiyyūn) lived and prospered in peace amidst Muslim communities and states. However, the law (shir‘ah) and way of life (minhāj) are different, yet the divinely ordained religion is, in essence, the same. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Prophets are half brothers; their mothers are different but their religion is the same.” [Al-Bukhārī: 3443, Muslim: 2365]"
  5,49,"And judge between them [O Prophet] according to what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires. And beware of them, lest they entice you away from some of what Allah has sent down to you. If they turn away, then know that it is Allah’s will to punish them for some of their sins, and many people are indeed rebellious.",""
  5,50,"Do they seek the judgment of the times of ignorance<sup>47</sup>? Who could be better than Allah in judgment for people who are certain in faith?","[47] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""The most hated persons to Allah are three: [among them is] a person who wants that the traditions of the pre-Islamic period of ignorance should remain in Islam."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 21]"
