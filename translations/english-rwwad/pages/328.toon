quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  21,73,"And We made them leaders, guiding people by Our command, and We inspired them to do righteous deeds, establish prayer and give zakah<sup>28</sup>; and they were Our true worshipers.","[28] The term ""zakah"" denotes purification and growth."
  21,74,"To Lot We gave sound judgment and knowledge, and We saved him from the town that was engrossed in shameful practices. They were Indeed an evil and rebellious people.",""
  21,75,"And We admitted him to Our mercy, for he was one of the righteous.",""
  21,76,"And [remember] Noah, when he called out<sup>29</sup> to Us before, so We responded to him and saved him and his household<sup>30</sup> from the great distress.","[29] i.e., supplicated against his people who had persisted in denial.\n [30] i.e., the believers of his household."
  21,77,"And We helped him against the people who rejected Our signs. They were indeed evil people, so We drowned them all.",""
  21,78,"And [remember] David and Solomon, when they passed judgment about the tillage into which some people’s sheep had strayed at night<sup>31</sup>, and We were witnesses to their judgment.","[31] Destroying the crops and eating therefrom."
  21,79,"We made Solomon understand it<sup>32</sup>, although We gave each of them sound judgment and knowledge. We subjected the mountains and birds to glorify Allah along with David. It was We Who did all this.","[32] A man’s flock of sheep strayed into another man’s tillage. When the two men came to David for judgment, he ruled that the shepherd must give his sheep in compensation for the damage. Nonetheless, Solomon suggested that the sheep be kept with the owner of the tillage, so he may benefit from their milk and wool, while the shepherd should work on the land to restore it to its former state. Thus, the farmer would take back his tillage in perfect condition, and the sheep would be returned to its owner. David was impressed by his son’s insightful and fair judgment and approved it."
  21,80,"And We taught him<sup>33</sup> the art of making coats of mail for you to protect yourselves in your battle. Will you then be grateful?","[33] i.e., David apart from Solomon."
  21,81,"And to Solomon [We subjected] the raging wind, to blow by his command to the land We had blessed. It is We Who have full knowledge of everything.",""
