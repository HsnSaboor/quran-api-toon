Both are derived from ""hamd"" which means praise. Some scholars believe that this verse refers to John 14:16, where Jesus says: “And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Paraclete, to be with you forever.” Paraclete in Greek means ‘the praised one.’ Prophet Muhammad's (ﷺ) name is mentioned several times in the Gospel of Barnabas, which the Christian authorities deem as apocryphal Bible."
