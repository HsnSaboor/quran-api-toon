quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  13,29,"Those who believe and do righteous deeds, for them there will be bliss<sup>25</sup> and a good return.”","[25] Tūbā: all that is good and comely in Paradise."
  13,30,"Thus did We send you to a community before which other communities had passed away, so that you may recite to them what We have revealed to you, yet they disbelieve in the Most Compassionate. Say, “He is my Lord; none has the right to be worshiped except Him. In Him I put my trust, and to Him is my return.”",""
  13,31,"Even if there were a Qur’an that could cause mountains to move<sup>26</sup>, or split the earth, or cause the dead to speak, [they would still not believe]. To Allah belongs all matters. Do the believers not know that if Allah had willed, He could have guided all humans? Calamities will continue to befall the disbelievers or strike close to their homes because of their deeds, until the promise of Allah comes to pass, for Allah does not fail in His promise.","[26] “Had We sent down this Qur’an upon a mountain, you would have seen it humbled and break asunder out of awe of Allah!” See 59:21."
  13,32,"There were messengers before you who were ridiculed, but I gave respite to those who disbelieved, then I seized them<sup>27</sup>. How [terrible] was My chastisement!","[27] This is a comforting note to the Prophet (ﷺ)."
  13,33,"Is He Who watches every soul in whatever it does [like others]? Yet they ascribe partners to Allah. Say, “Name them! Or do you presume to inform Him of something that He does not know on earth, or it is just a show of words?” No, but the falsehood of the disbelievers is made appealing to them, and they are hindered from the [straight] path. Whoever Allah causes to stray, he will have none to guide.",""
  13,34,"They will be punished in this life, but the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe, and they will have no protector against Allah.",""
