quran[3]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,176,"They ask you for a ruling. Say, “Allah gives you a ruling concerning the one leaving neither descendant nor ascendant as heir. If he dies leaving no child but a sister, she will get one-half of the inheritance. Likewise, he will inherit her if she dies leaving behind no descendant. If they are two sisters, they will share two-thirds of the inheritance. Should there be both male and female siblings, then the share of a male is equal to that of two females.”<sup>114</sup> Allah explains it clearly so that you do not fall into error. And Allah is All-Knowing of everything.","[114] This verse can be a prelude to the next surah which carries on explaining the laws and rules for the believing community in a greater detail."
  5,1,"O you who believe, fulfill your covenants<sup>1</sup>. Lawful to you are all grazing livestock, except what is recited to you [in the Qur’an], as well as hunting is prohibited while you are in the state of pilgrimage<sup>2</sup>. Allah ordains what He wills.","[1] i.e., pledges with Allah or human beings. [2] i.e., in the state of hajj or ‘umrah."
  5,2,"O you who believe, do not violate the sanctity of the rituals of Allah, nor of the sacred month<sup>3</sup>, nor the sacrificial animals, nor the garlands<sup>4</sup>, nor those [pilgrims] proceeding to the Sacred House seeking their Lord’s grace and pleasure. When your pilgrimage has ended, you may hunt. However, do not let the hatred of a people who barred you from the Sacred Mosque lead you to transgress. Cooperate with one another in goodness and righteousness, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah, for Allah is severe in punishment.","[3] The four sacrosanct months are Dhul-Qi‘dah, Dhul-Hijjah, Muḥarram, and Rajab. [Al-Bukhārī: 4662, Muslim: 1679].\n [4] Al-Qalā’id is hady (gifted offerings): garlands were put around the necks of unaccompanied offerings; hence, they were safe to roam and graze freely. [cf. Ibn Qutaybah, Gharīb al-Qur’ān; Ibn Fāris, Maqāyīs al-Lughah]."
