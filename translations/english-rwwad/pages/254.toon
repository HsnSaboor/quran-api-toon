  13,36,"Those whom We gave the Scripture<sup>28</sup> rejoice at that which is sent down to you [O Prophet], but there are some factions who deny part of it. Say, “I have only been commanded to worship Allah, and associate none with Him. To Him I call and to Him is my return.”","[28] From the Jews and the Christians."
  13,37,"Thus We have sent it down as a commandment in Arabic. If you were to follow their<sup>29</sup> desires after the knowledge that has come to you, you would have no supporter or protector against Allah.","[29] i.e., the People of the Book."
  13,38,"We have sent messengers before you and gave them wives and offspring<sup>30</sup>. It was not for any messenger to bring a sign except with Allah’s permission. Every matter has a destined time.","[30] These are the basic human needs, for Messengers are human beings, not angelic beings."
  13,39,"Allah eliminates what He wills or affirms it<sup>31</sup>, and with Him is the Master Book<sup>32</sup>.","[31] Although everything is set in the Record, He decrees whatever He wishes and the angels erase or affirm in the scrolls whatever He dictates.\n [32] The Preserved Tablet."
