quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,150,"When Moses returned to his people, furious and grieved, he said, “What an evil thing you did in my absence! Did you seek to hasten the command of your Lord<sup>51</sup>?” He threw the Tablets<sup>52</sup> and grabbed his brother by the hair, dragging him towards himself. Aaron said, “O son of my mother, the people overpowered me and were about to kill me. Do not make my enemies rejoice over me, nor count me among the people of wrongdoing.”","[51] i.e., “Could you not have waited until I came back to you with your Lord’s good guidance?”.\n [52] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Hearing is not like seeing. Allah told Moses of what his people did with the calf and he did not throw down the tablets. Yet, when he actually saw what they did he threw them down!” [Imām Aḥmad: 2447; Ibn Hibbān: 6213]"
  7,151,"Moses said, “My Lord, forgive me and my brother<sup>53</sup>, and admit us into Your mercy, for You are the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.”","[53] He practically apologized to his brother and accepted his explanation."
  7,152,"As for those who took the calf for worship, they will certainly be afflicted with wrath from their Lord and disgrace in the life of this world. This is how We recompense those who invent falsehood.",""
  7,153,"But those who commit evil deeds, then repent thereafter and [truly] believe, then your Lord is indeed All-Forgiving<sup>54</sup>, Most Merciful.","[54] This shows that no matter how grave the sin is, Allah will forgive it if the person truly repents and believes."
  7,154,"When Moses’ fury calmed down, he picked up the Tablets; in their inscription there was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord.",""
  7,155,"Moses chose seventy men from among his people for Our appointment. When the earthquake seized them<sup>55</sup>, he said, “My Lord, had it been Your will, You could have destroyed them earlier, and me too; will You destroy us for what the fools among us have done? This is not but a trial from You, by which You cause to stray whom You will and guide whom You will. You are our Guardian, so forgive us and have mercy upon us, for You are the Best of Forgivers.","[55] When they reached the appointed place, they said to Moses, ""O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah openly."" (2:55) So the mountain convulsed, killing them."
