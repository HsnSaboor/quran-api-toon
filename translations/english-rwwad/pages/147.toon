quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,143,"[They are] eight [in four] pairs: a pair of sheep and a pair of goats. Say, “Has He forbidden the two males or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Tell me on the basis of knowledge, if you are truthful.”",""
  6,144,"Likewise, a pair of camels and a pair of cattle. Say, “Has He forbidden the two males or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you present when Allah gave you this commandment?” So who does greater wrong than the one who fabricates lies against Allah in order to mislead people without knowledge? Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.",""
  6,145,"Say [O Prophet], “I do not find in what has been revealed to me anything forbidden to eat except carrion, running blood or the swine flesh – which is impure – or a sinful offering in the name of other than Allah. However, if someone is compelled by necessity – neither driven by desire nor transgressing due limit – then your Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”",""
  6,146,"To the Jews We forbade every animal of undivided hooves<sup>52</sup>, and of the cattle and sheep, We forbade their fat except what attaches to their backs or intestines, or what sticks to their bones. This is how We recompensed them for their transgression, and We are Truthful.","[52] i.e., clawed animals that have nails in their toes, e.g. camels, ostriches, etc."
