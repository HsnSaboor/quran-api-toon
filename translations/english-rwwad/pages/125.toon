quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,104,"When it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger,” they say, “What we have found our forefathers upon is sufficient for us.” Even though their forefathers knew nothing nor were they guided?",""
  5,105,"O you who believe, take care of your own selves. Those who have gone astray will not harm you as long as you are guided<sup>70</sup>. To Allah you will all return, then He will inform you of what you used to do.","[70] After you call them to guidance, their rejection will not harm you."
  5,106,"O you who believe, when death approaches one of you, call upon two just Muslim men as witnesses when you make a bequest, or two non-Muslims if you are afflicted with death while you are traveling. But if you have some doubt, keep them both after prayer<sup>71</sup> and let them swear by Allah, “We will not trade our testimony for any price, even in favor of a close relative, nor will we conceal the testimony enjoined by Allah, for then we would surely be among the sinners.”","[71] Prayers are usually attended by a congregation of people."
  5,107,"If they are found guilty [of false testimony], let two others take their place, nearest in kin from among those who claim a lawful right, and let them swear by Allah, “Our testimony is more truthful than their testimony, and we have not transgressed, for then we would surely be among the wrongdoers.”",""
  5,108,"That is more likely that they will give true testimony, or else they will fear that their oaths could be refuted by the oaths of the others afterwards. Fear Allah and listen [obediently], for Allah does not guide the rebellious people.",""
