quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,60,"Have you not seen [O Prophet] those<sup>45</sup> who claim that they believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you, yet they seek the judgment of Tāghoot<sup>46</sup> [i.e., false judges]<sup>47</sup>, even though they were commanded to reject them? Satan wants to lead them far astray.","[45] i.e., the hypocrites.\n [46] Tāghūt: See 2:256. [47] This verse was revealed about a group of the Aslam tribe, who professed Islam, then went to Abu Zurārah al-Aslamī, the soothsayer, to settle a dispute."
  4,61,"When it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger,” you will see the hypocrites turn away from you in aversion.",""
  4,62,"How will it be when a disaster befalls them because of what their hands have sent forth, then they come to you swearing by Allah, “We intended nothing but good and reconciliation.”",""
  4,63,"They are those whom Allah knows what is in their hearts; so turn away from them<sup>48</sup>, admonish them, and speak to them in a far-reaching effective way.","[48] That is, do not punish them for their insincerity, so long as they did not make manifest their disbelief."
  4,64,"We did not send any Messenger but to be obeyed by Allah’s permission. If only they had come to you [O Prophet] – after wronging themselves – and had asked Allah for forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked for forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Accepting of Repentance, Most Merciful.",""
  4,65,"But no, by your Lord, they will not believe until they accept you [O Prophet] as judge in their disputes, and find no discomfort within their hearts about your judgments, but accept them wholeheartedly.",""
