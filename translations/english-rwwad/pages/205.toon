quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,112,"[Those believers] are the ones who repent, who constantly worship, who praise Him, who fast, who bow down and prostrate, who enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and who observe the limits set by Allah; give glad tidings to the believers.",""
  9,113,"It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe to seek forgiveness for the polytheists<sup>83</sup>, even if they are close relatives, after becoming clear to them that they are the people of Blazing Fire.","[83] When Abu Tālib, the Prophet’s uncle, died as a disbeliever, the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “By Allah, I shall keep on asking for forgiveness for you, unless I am told to cease!” Then this verse was revealed. [Al-Bukhārī: 3884, Muslim: 24]."
  9,114,"As for the prayer of Abraham for his father’s forgiveness, it was only because of a promise he had made to him. However, when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, he dissociated himself from him<sup>84</sup>. Indeed, Abraham was tender-hearted and forbearing.","[84] This prohibition is not exclusive to Islam as it has been in effect since the time of Abraham (عليه السلام)"
  9,115,"Allah will not cause a people to go astray after He has guided them until He makes clear to them what they should avoid<sup>85</sup>. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of everything.","[85] ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (رضي الله عنهما) reported regarding al-Haruriyah (the kharijites) that the Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""They will go out of Islam as an arrow darts out of the game’s body."" [Sahih al-Bukhāri: 66]"
  9,116,"Indeed, to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth. He gives life and causes death. You have no protector or helper besides Allah.",""
  9,117,"Indeed, Allah has turned in mercy to the Prophet, the Emigrants and the Helpers who followed him in the hour of hardship [at Tabūk], after some of them were about to lose heart. Then He turned to them in mercy, for He is All-Gracious, Most Merciful to them.",""
