quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,34,"Men are in charge of women, as Allah has made some of them excel the others, and because they spend of their wealth. Therefore the righteous women are obedient, and protect what Allah has entrusted them with<sup>23</sup> in [their husband’s] absence. As for those women on whose part you fear rebellion<sup>24</sup>, [first] admonish them, [next] forsake them in bed, and [last] hit them<sup>25</sup>. Then if they obey you, do not take further action against them. Indeed, Allah is Most High, All-Great.","[23] i.e., their husbands’ property and their own chastity.\n [24] i.e., major rebellion or refusal of basic religious obligations.\n [25] It may only be resorted to when the first two measures fail and when it is expected to mend the situation; otherwise, it is not allowed. ‘Ā’ishā’s (رضي الله عنها) says: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) never hit anything with his hand, nor a woman, nor a servant, except when he was fighting in the path of Allah” [Al-Bukhārī: 3149; Muslim: 1057] It must not be severe or damaging, and face must be avoided, as “the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prevented hitting the face” [Sahih Muslim: 2116]"
  4,35,"If you fear a breach between them, appoint an arbitrator from his family and another from hers. If they both want reconciliation, Allah will bring harmony between them. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.",""
  4,36,"Worship Allah and do not associate any partners with Him. Be kind to parents, relatives, orphans, the needy, near and distant neighbors, close friends, wayfarers, and slaves whom you own<sup>26</sup>. For Allah does not like those who are arrogant, boastful,","[26] This is known as the verse of the Ten Rights (al-huqūq al-‘ashrah)."
  4,37,"those who are stingy and promote stinginess among people<sup>27</sup>, and conceal what Allah has bestowed upon them of His bounty. We have prepared for disbelievers a humiliating punishment.","[27] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ""Everyday two angels come down from heaven; one of them says, ‘O Allah! Compensate every person who spends in Your cause,’ and the other says, ‘O Allah! Destroy every miser.’"" [Sahih Al-Bukhāri: 522]"
