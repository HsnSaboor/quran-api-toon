quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  48,16,"Say to the Bedouins who lagged behind, “You will be called against a people of great might<sup>8</sup>, whom you will fight unless they submit<sup>9</sup>. Then if you obey, Allah will give you a goodly reward, but if you turn away as you turned away before, He will afflict you with a painful punishment.","[8] Referring to the two pagan Arab tribes: Hawāzin and Thaqīf. [9] i.e., accept Islam."
  48,17,"There is no blame on the blind, nor on the lame, nor on the sick [for remaining behind]. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him into gardens under which rivers flow. But whoever turns away, He will afflict him with a painful punishment.",""
  48,18,"Allah was much pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you [O Prophet] under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquility upon them and rewarded them with an imminent conquest<sup>10</sup>,","[10] The conquest of Khaybar occurred in 7 A.H./628 C.E, which preceded that of Makkah."
  48,19,"and abundant spoils of war they will gain. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.",""
  48,20,"Allah has promised you abundant spoils of war that you will gain, and He has hastened for you this [conquest]<sup>11</sup>, and He has restrained people’s hands from you, so that it may be a sign for the believers, and so that He may guide you to a straight path.","[11] i.e., the spoils of Khaybar."
  48,21,"And there are other [spoils] that you have not yet been able to gain, but Allah has full control over them<sup>12</sup>, for Allah is Most Capable of all things.","[12] i.e., Allah has prepared or decreed them for you."
  48,22,"If the disbelievers were to fight you, they would surely turn their backs, then they would not have any protector or helper.",""
  48,23,"Such was the way of Allah in the past, and you will not find any change in Allah’s way.",""
