quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  48,1,"Indeed, We have given you [O Prophet] a clear conquest<sup>1</sup>,","[1] This surah takes its name ""Surah al-Fath"" (Surah of Conquest) from the clear conquest mentioned in this verse. This treaty was signed in 6 A.H./628 C.E. Ibn Mas‘ūd said, ""You [people] consider the conquest to be that of Makkah, but we consider it to be the Treaty of al-Hudaybiyyah."" Al-Barā’ bin ‘Āzib said something similar to this as reported by Al-Bukhāri. Although the companions initially regarded this treaty as a setback, yet in effect, it helped promote the spread of Islam, as thousands of people from different tribes accepted Islam during that truce. This treaty was in fact a precursor to the conquest of Makkah two years later."
  48,2,"so that Allah may forgive you your previous and future sins<sup>2</sup>, complete His favor upon you, and guide you to a straight path,","[2] i.e., sins before this conquest and sins after it. See footnote 40:55, 47:19."
  48,3,"and so that Allah may help you with a mighty victory.",""
  48,4,"It is He Who sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers so that they may increase in faith along with their faith. To Allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and earth. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",""
  48,5,"So that He may admit the believing men and women to gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever, and absolve them of their sins; that is a supreme triumph before Allah.",""
  48,6,"And so that He may punish hypocrite men and women and polytheist men and women, who harbor about Allah evil thoughts<sup>3</sup>. An evil fate will befall them. Allah is angry with them and has cursed them and prepared for them Hell. What a terrible destination!","[3] i.e., that Allah will not support His religion and His Prophet (ﷺ) and that the believers will end up with misfortune and defeat."
  48,7,"To Allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and earth, and Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.",""
  48,8,"Indeed, We have sent you [O prophet] as a witness, a bearer of glad tidings, and a warner,",""
  48,9,"so that you may believe in Allah and His Messenger, support and revere him, and glorify Him morning and evening.",""
