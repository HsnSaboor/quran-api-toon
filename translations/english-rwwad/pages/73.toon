quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,174,"They then returned with grace and bounty from Allah, having suffered no harm. They pursued Allah’s pleasure, and Allah is the Possessor of great bounty.",""
  3,175,"It is Satan who frightens [you] through his allies. Do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are [true] believers.",""
  3,176,"Do not let those<sup>85</sup> who hasten to disbelief grieve you; they can never harm Allah in the least. It is Allah’s will that they will have no share in the Hereafter, and for them there will be a great punishment.","[85] The hypocrites."
  3,177,"Those who purchase disbelief [in exchange] for faith can never harm Allah in the least, and for them there will be a painful punishment.",""
  3,178,"Those who disbelieve should not think that whatever respite We give them is good for them. We only give them respite so that they may increase in sin, and for them there will be a disgracing punishment.",""
  3,179,"Allah would not leave the believers in the state you are in, until He distinguishes the evil from the good<sup>86</sup>, nor would Allah reveal to you [believers] the unseen, but Allah chooses from His messengers<sup>87</sup> whom He wills. So believe in Allah and His messengers; if you believe and fear Allah, you will have a great reward.","[86] Hypocrites were initially living in the midst of the believers pretending to be believers and wishing for the worst to come upon the real believers. In order to separate the wheat from the chaff, Allah decreed the calamity in the Battle of Uhud; so the hypocrites could be told apart. [87] The unseen here was informing the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) about the real hypocrites so that he may be on guard against them."
  3,180,"Those who greedily withhold what Allah has given them of His grace, should not think that it is good for them, rather it is bad for them; their necks will be chained<sup>88</sup> by what they greedily withheld on the Day of Resurrection. To Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and earth, and Allah is All-Aware of what you do.","[88] Abu Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) reported that Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) said: ""Anyone whom Allah has given wealth but he does not pay its Zakāt; then, on the Day of Resurrection, his wealth will be presented to him in the shape of a bald-headed poisonous male snake with two poisonous glands in its mouth and it will encircle itself round his neck and bite him over his cheeks and say, ‘I am your wealth; I am your treasure.’"" Then the Prophet (ﷺ) recited this divine verse. [Fath al-Bāri 4/11-13, Sahih al-Bukhāri: 88]."
