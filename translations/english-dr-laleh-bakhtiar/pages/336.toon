quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,31,"Turn to God as monotheists not with Him as ones who are polytheists. And whoever ascribes partners with God, it is as if he fell down from heaven and the birds snatch him or the wind hurled him to ruin in a place far away"
  22,32,"That was commanded! Whoever holds the waymarks of God in honor, then, it is, truly, from hearts filled with God-consciousness"
  22,33,"For you in that is what profits for a term, that which is determined. Again, their place of sacrifice is at the Ancient House"
  22,34,"And for every community We assigned devotional acts that they may remember the Name of God over what We provided them of flocks of animals. And your God is One God. Submit to Him, and give thou good tidings to the ones who humble themselves"
  22,35,"those who, when God was remembered, their hearts took notice and the ones who remain steadfast against whatever lit on them and the ones who perform the formal prayer and who spends out of what We provided them"
  22,36,"We made for you the beasts of sacrifice among the waymarks of God. You have in them much good so remember the Name of God over them, ones who are standing in ranks. Then, when they collapsed on their sides, eat from them and feed the ones who are paupers and the ones who are poor persons who beg not. Thus, We caused them to be subservient to you so that perhaps you will give thanks"
  22,37,"Neither their flesh nor their blood attains to God, rather, God-consciousness from you attains Him. Thus, He caused them to be subservient to you that you magnify God in that He guided you. And give thou good tidings to the ones who are doers of good"
  22,38,"Truly, God defends those who believed. Truly, God loves not any who is an ungrateful betrayer"
