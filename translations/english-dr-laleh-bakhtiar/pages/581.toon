  77,20,Create We you not of despicable water
  77,21,"Then, We made it in a secure stopping place"
  77,22,for a known measuring
  77,23,And We measured. How bountiful are the ones who measure
  77,24,Woe on that day to the ones who deny

  77,26,the living and the lifeless
  77,27,"We made on it soaring, firm mountains. We satiated you with water of the sweetest kind"
  77,28,Woe on that Day to the ones who deny
  77,29,Set out toward what you had been in it denying
  77,30,Set out to the shade. It is possessor of three columns

  77,45,Woe on that Day to the ones who deny
  77,46,"Eat, take joy for a little. You are ones who sin"
  77,47,Woe on that Day to the ones who deny
  77,48,"When it will be said: Bow down, they bow not down"
  77,49,Woe on that Day to the ones who deny
  77,50,"Then, in which discourse after this will they believe"
