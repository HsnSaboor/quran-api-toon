quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  36,28,"After him We caused not to descend on his folk an army from heaven, nor had We been ones who need to cause to descend again"
  36,29,It would be but one Cry and that is when they were ones who are silent and still
  36,30,"O how regrettable of the servants! A Messenger approaches them not, but they had been ridiculing him"
  36,31,"Consider they not how many generations We caused to perish before them who, truly, return not to them"
  36,32,"And, truly, all of them will be altogether, ones who are charged in Our Presence"
  36,33,And a sign for them is the dead body of the earth. We gave life to it and We brought out grain from it so that they eat from it
  36,34,We made in them gardens of date palm trees and grapevines and We caused a spring to gush forth in it
  36,35,"so that they may eat of the fruit from there that are not what their hands did. Will they, then, not give thanks"
  36,36,"Glory be to Him Who created pairs, all of them, of what the earth causes to develop as well as of themselves and of what they know not"
  36,37,And a sign for them is the nighttime. We pluck the daytime from it and that is when they are ones in darkness
  36,38,"And the sun runs to a resting place for it. That is foreordained by The Almighty, The Knowing"
  36,39,"And for the moon We ordained mansions until it reverted like an ripe aged, dry, date stalk"
  36,40,It is not fit and proper for the sun to overtake the moon nor the nighttime one to take the lead over the daytime. They each swim in an orbit
