quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,"Truly, those who believe not in the world to come naming the angels with female names"
  53,28,"while they have no knowledge of it, they follow nothing but opinion. And, truly, opinion avails them not at all against The Truth"
  53,29,So turn thou aside from him who turns away from Our Remembrance and he wants nothing but this present life
  53,30,"That is their attainment of the knowledge. Truly, thy Lord, He is the One Who is greater in knowledge of whoever went astray from His way. And He is greater in knowledge of whoever were truly guided"
  53,31,And to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth that He may give recompense to those who did evil for what they did and give recompense fairer to those who did good
  53,32,"those who avoid the major sins and the indecencies but the lesser offenses. Truly, thy Lord is One Who is Extensive in forgiveness. He is greater in knowledge of you when He caused you to grow from the earth and when you were an unborn child in the wombs of your mothers. So you make not pure yourselves. He is greater in knowledge of him who was Godfearing"
  53,33,Hadst thou considered him who turned away
  53,34,"and gave a little, giving grudgingly"
  53,35,Is the knowledge of the unseen with him so that he sees it
  53,36,Or is he told what is in the scrolls of Moses
  53,37,and of Abraham who paid his account in full
  53,38,The burdened soul will not bear the heavy load of another
  53,39,The human being is not but what he endeavored for
  53,40,and that his endeavoring will be seen
  53,41,"Again, he will be given recompense for it with a more true recompense"
  53,42,and that towards thy Lord is the Utmost Boundary
  53,43,and that He caused laughter and caused weeping
  53,44,and that He caused to die and gave life
