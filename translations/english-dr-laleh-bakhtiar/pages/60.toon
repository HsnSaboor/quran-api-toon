quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,78,"And, truly, among them is a group of people who distort their tongues with the Book so that you assume it is from the Book, although it is not from the Book. And they say: It is from God, although it is not from God. And they say a lie against God while they know"
  3,79,"It had not been for a mortal that God should give him the Book and critical judgment and the prophethood and, again, he say to humanity: Be you servants of me instead of God! Rather, he would say: Be you masters, because you had been teaching the Book and because you had been studying it"
  3,80,Nor would He command you to take to yourselves the angels and the Prophets as lords. Would He command you to ingratitude after you are ones who submit to God
  3,81,"And mention when God took a solemn promise from the Prophets: Whatever I gave you of the Book and wisdom, again, if a Messenger drew near you with that which establishes as true what is with you, you will believe in him and you will help him. He said: Are you in accord? And will you take on My severe test? They said: We are in accord. He said: Then, bear witness and I am with you among the ones who bear witness"
  3,82,"Then, whoever turned away after this, then, those, they are the ones who disobey"
  3,83,Desire they other than the way of life of God while to Him submitted whatever is in the heavens and the earth willingly or unwillingly and they are returned to Him
