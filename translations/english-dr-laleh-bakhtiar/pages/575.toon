quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Truly, thy Lord knows that thou be standing up for nearly two thirds of the nighttime, or a half of it or a third of it along with a section of those who are with thee. And God ordains the nighttime and the daytime. He knew that you would not be able to keep count of it, so He turned towards you in forgiveness, then recite of the Quran as much as was easy. He knew that some of you are sick and others travel on the earth looking for the grace of God and others fight in the way of God. So recite of it as much as was easy. And perform the formal prayer and give the purifying alms and lend to God a fairer loan. For whatever of good you put forward for your souls, you will find the same with God. It is good and a sublime compensation. And ask God for forgiveness. Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate"
  74,1,"O thou, the one who wrapped himself in a cloak"
  74,2,Stand up and warn
  74,3,And magnify thy Lord
  74,4,and purify thy garments
  74,5,and abandon contamination
  74,6,And reproach not others to acquire more for yourself
  74,7,"And for thy Lord, then, have thou patience"
  74,8,"Then, when the horn is sounded"
  74,9,"truly, that Day will be a difficult day"
  74,10,and not easy for the ones who are ungrateful
  74,11,Forsake to Me whom I alone created
  74,12,I assigned to him the spreading out of wealth
  74,13,and children as ones who bear witness
  74,14,"And I made smooth for him, a making smooth"
  74,15,"Again, he is desirous that I increase it"
  74,16,No indeed; he had been stubborn about Our signs
  74,17,I will constrain him with a hard ascent
