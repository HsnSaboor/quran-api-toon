quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the heaven and the night visitor
  86,2,what will cause thee to recognize what the night visitor is
  86,3,It is the piercing star
  86,4,"Truly, every soul has one who guards it"
  86,5,So let the human being look on of what he was created
  86,6,"He was created of water, that which gushes forth"
  86,7,going forth from between the loins and the breast bone
  86,8,"Truly, He, in returning him, certainly is One Who Has Power"
  86,9,On a Day all secret thoughts will be tried
  86,10,"then, there will not be for him any strength nor one who helps"
  86,11,By the heaven possessing the returning
  86,12,and by the earth splitting with verdure
  86,13,"truly, the Quran is a decisive saying"
  86,14,and it is not for mirth
  86,15,"Truly, they are strategizing a strategy"
  86,16,And I am strategizing a strategy
  86,17,So respite the ones who are ungrateful! Grant thou them a delay for a while
  87,1,"Glorify the Name of thy Lord, The Lofty"
  87,2,Who created and shaped
  87,3,"and who ordained and, then, guided"
  87,4,and who brought out the pasture
  87,5,"then, made it dark colored refuse"
  87,6,We will make thee recite and thou wilt not forget
  87,7,"but what God willed. Truly, He knows the openly published and whatever is hidden"
  87,8,And We will make easy for thee an easing
  87,9,So remind if a reminder profited them
  87,10,Whoever dreads God will recollect
  87,11,but the disappointed will scorn it—
  87,12,even he who will roast in the great fire
  87,13,"again, neither dying in it nor living"
  87,14,"He, surely, prospered, he who purified himself"
  87,15,and remembered the Name of his Lord and invoked blessings
