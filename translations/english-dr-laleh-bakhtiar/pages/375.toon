  26,186,"And thou art nothing but a mortal like us. And, truly, we think thee to be among the ones who lie"
  26,187,"So cause pieces of heaven to drop on us, if you had been among the ones who are sincere"
  26,188,"He said: My Lord is greater in knowledge of what you do"
  26,189,"But they denied him. So took them the punishment on the overshadowing day. Truly, that had been the punishment of a tremendous Day"
  26,190,"Truly, in this is a sign. Yet most of them had not been ones who believe"
  26,191,"And, truly, thy Lord, He is, certainly, The Almighty, The Compassionate"
  26,192,"And this, truly, is the sending down successively of the Lord of the worlds"
  26,193,that the Trustworthy Spirit brought down
  26,194,on thy heart that thou be among the one who warn
  26,195,in a clear Arabic tongue
  26,196,"And, truly, it is in the ancient scrolls of the ancient ones"
  26,197,Would it not be a sign for them that is known to the knowing among the Children of Israel
  26,198,And if We sent it down to some of the non-Arabs
  26,199,"and he recited it to them, they had not been ones who believe in it"
  26,200,"Thus, We thrust it into the hearts of the ones who sin"

  26,204,Seek they to hasten Our punishment
  26,205,Hadst thou considered that if We gave them enjoyment for years
  26,206,"and, again, there drew near them what they had been promised"
