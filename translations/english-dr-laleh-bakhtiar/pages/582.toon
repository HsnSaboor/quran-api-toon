quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,About what demand you of one another
  78,2,Of the sublime tiding
  78,3,about which they are ones who are at variance in it
  78,4,No indeed! Soon they will know
  78,5,"Again, no indeed! Soon they will know"
  78,6,Make We not the earth for a cradling
  78,7,and the mountains as stakes
  78,8,And We created not you in pairs
  78,9,and We made your sleep as a rest
  78,10,And We made the nighttime as a garment
  78,11,And We made the daytime for you to earn a living
  78,12,And We built over you seven superior ones
  78,13,"And We made a bright, light-giving lamp"
  78,14,"And We caused to descend that which are clouds bringing rain, water cascading"
  78,15,with which We bring about grain and plants
  78,16,and luxuriant Gardens
  78,17,"Truly, the Day of Decision would be a time appointed"
  78,18,"a Day the trumpet is blown. Then, you approach in units"
  78,19,and the heaven will be let loose and will be all doors
  78,20,And the mountains will be set in motion and will be as vapor
  78,21,"Truly, hell will be on the watch"
  78,22,a destination for the ones who are defiant
  78,23,one who lingers in expectation in it for many years
  78,24,They experience in it not any coolness nor any drink
  78,25,but scalding water and filth
  78,26,a suitable recompense
  78,27,"Truly, they had been not hoping not for a reckoning"
  78,28,and they denied Our signs with a denial
  78,29,But We counted everything in a Book
  78,30,Experience it! We will never increase you but in punishment
