quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  15,71,"Lot said: These are my daughters if you hadst been ones who do something"
  15,72,"By thy life, truly, they were in a daze, wandering unwilling to see"
  15,73,So the Cry took them at sunrise
  15,74,And We made its high part low and We rained down on them rocks of baked clay
  15,75,"Truly, in this are signs for the ones who read marks"
  15,76,"And, truly, they are ones who are on an abiding way"
  15,77,"Truly, in it is a sign for the ones who believe"
  15,78,"And, truly, the Companions of the Thicket had been ones who are unjust"
  15,79,so We requited them and they were both on a clear high road
  15,80,"Certainly, the Companions of the Rocky Tract denied the ones who are sent"
  15,81,"And We gave them Our signs. Then, they had been ones who turn aside from them"
  15,82,And they had been carving out safe houses from mountains
  15,83,but the Cry took them in that which is morning
  15,84,And availed them not what they had been earning
  15,85,"And We created not the heavens and the earth and whatever is in between them but with The Truth. And, truly, the Hour is one that arrives. So overlook with a graceful overlooking"
  15,86,"Truly, thy Lord is The Knowing Creator"
  15,87,"And, certainly, We gave thee seven often repeated parts of the sublime Quran"
  15,88,"And stretch not out thy eyes for what We gave of enjoyment in this life to spouses among them, nor feel remorse for them, but make low thy wing in kindness to the ones who believe"
  15,89,"And say: Truly, I am a clear warner"
  15,90,even as We caused to descend on the ones who are partitioners
