quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"Their parable is like a parable of those who started a fire. Then, when it illuminated what was around it, God took away their light and left them in shadows where they perceive not"
  2,18,"Unwilling to hear, unwilling to speak, unwilling to see, then, they will not return to the way"
  2,19,"Or as a cloudburst from heaven in which there are shadows and thunder and lightning. They lay their fingertips in their ears from the thunderbolt, being fearful of death. And God is One Who Encloses the ones who are ungrateful"
  2,20,"The lightning almost snatches their sight. When it illuminated for them, they walked in the light. And when it grew dark against them, they stood still. And if God willed, He would have taken away their having the ability to hear and their sight. Truly, God is Powerful over everything"

  2,23,"And if you had been in doubt about what We sent down to Our servant, then approach with a Chapter of the Quran —the like of it— and call to your witnesses other than God if you had been ones who are sincere"
  2,24,"And if you accomplish it not —and you will never accomplish it— then be Godfearing of the fire whose fuel is humanity and rocks, prepared for the ones who are ungrateful"
