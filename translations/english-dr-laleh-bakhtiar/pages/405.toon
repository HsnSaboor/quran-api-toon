  30,8,"Or if they reflect not in themselves, God created not the heavens and the earth and whatever is between the two but with The Truth and for a term that is determined. And, truly, most of humanity, in the meeting with their Lord, are, certainly, ones who disbelieve"
  30,9,"Or journey they not through the earth and look on how had been the Ultimate End of those who were before them? They had been superior to them in strength.

Then, it had not been God doing wrong to them, but they had been doing wrong to themselves"

  30,15,"Then, as for those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, they will be walking with joy in a well-watered meadow"
