quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  57,12,"On a Day thou wilt see the males, ones who believe and the females, ones who believe, their light coming eagerly in advance of them and on their right: Good tidings for you this Day, Gardens beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever. That, it is the winning the sublime triumph"
  57,13,"On a Day will say the males, ones who are hypocrites and females, the ones who are hypocrites to those who believed: Wait for us that we will borrow from your light. It will be said: Return behind and search out for a light. There would be a fence set up between them for which there is a door. That which is inward is mercy and that which is outward is towards the punishment"
  57,14,"The hypocrites will cry out to the believers: Have we not been with you? They will say: Yea! And you let yourselves be tempted and you awaited and you were in doubt and you were deluded by following your fantasies until the command of God drew near and the deluder deluded you in regard to God"
  57,15,So this Day ransom will not be taken from you nor from those who were ungrateful. Your place of shelter will be the fire. It is your defender. And miserable will be the Homecoming
  57,16,"Is it not time for those who believed that their hearts be humbled by the Remembrance of God and to The Truth that came down to them and that they not be like those who were given the Book before? Then, the space of time was long for them so their hearts became hard. And many of them were ones who disobey"
  57,17,"Know you that God gives life to the earth after its death. Surely, We made manifest the signs to you so that perhaps you will be reasonable"
  57,18,"Truly, the males, ones who are charitable and the females, ones who are charitable and who lent a fairer loan to God, it will be multiplied for them and for them there is a generous compensation"
