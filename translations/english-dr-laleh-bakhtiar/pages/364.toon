  25,44,Or assume thou that most of them hear or are reasonable? They are not but as flocks. Nay! They are ones who go astray from a way
  25,45,"Hast thou not considered how thy Lord stretched out the shade? If He willed, He would make it a place of rest. Again, We made the sun an indicator over it"
  25,46,"Again, We seized it to Us an easy seizing"
  25,47,And it is He Who made the nighttime a garment for you and sleep a rest and made the daytime for rising
  25,48,"And it is He Who sent the winds, bearers of good tidings in advance of His Mercy. And We caused to descend undefiled water from heaven"
  25,49,that We give life by it to a lifeless land and with it We satiate. We created flocks on it and many humans
  25,50,"And, certainly, We diversified among them so that they recollect. Then, most of humanity refused everything, but disbelief"
  25,51,"And if We willed, We would have raised up a warner in every town"
  25,52,So obey not the ones who are ungrateful and struggle against them thereby with a great struggle
  25,53,"And it is He Who let forth the two seas—this, agreeable and water of the sweetest kind and this, salty, bitter. He made between the two that which was unapproachable, a banned barrier"
  25,54,And it is He Who created a mortal from water and made for him kindred by blood and kin by marriage. And thy Lord had been ever Powerful
  25,55,And they worship other than God what neither profits them nor hurts them. And the one who is ungrateful had been ever a sustainer against his Lord
