quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By time through the ages
  103,2,"truly, the human being is, surely, in a loss"
  103,3,"but those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, and counseled one another to The Truth, and counseled one another to having patience"
  104,1,Woe to every slandering backbiter
  104,2,who gathered wealth and counted it over and over
  104,3,He assumes that his wealth made him immortal
  104,4,No indeed! He will be cast forth into the Crusher
  104,5,And what will cause thee to recognize what the Crusher is
  104,6,"It is the fire of God, that which is kindled eternally"
  104,7,that peruses the minds
  104,8,that which will be closing in on them
  104,9,"with its pillars, ones that are outstretched"
  105,1,Hast thou not considered what thy Lord accomplished with the Companions of the Elephant
  105,2,Makes He not their cunning leading to nothing
  105,3,And He sent upon them flocks of birds
  105,4,throwing at them rocks of baked clay
  105,5,"Then, made He them like ones who are consumed by stalks of husked grain"
