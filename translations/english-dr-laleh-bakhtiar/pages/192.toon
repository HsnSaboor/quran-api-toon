quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,32,"They want to extinguish the light of God with their mouths, but God refuses so that He fulfill His light even if the ones who are ungrateful disliked it"
  9,33,"It is He Who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the way of life of The Truth so that He may uplift it over all ways of life, even if the ones who are polytheists disliked it"
  9,34,"O those who believed! Truly, there are many of the learned Jewish scholars and monks who consume the wealth of humanity in falsehood and bar from the way of God and those who treasure up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of God. Give to them tidings of a painful punishment"
  9,35,"on a Day it will be hot in the fire of hell. Then, by it are branded their foreheads and their sides and their backs. It will be said: This is what you treasured up for yourselves so experience what you had been treasuring up"
  9,36,"Truly, the period of months with God is twelve lunar months in the Book of God. On the day when He created the heavens and the earth of them. Four are sanctified. That is the truth-loving way of life. So do not wrong yourselves in it. And fight the ones who are polytheists collectively, as they fight you collectively. And know that God is with the ones who are Godfearing"
