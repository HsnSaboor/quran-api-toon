quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,6,"O those who believed! When you stood up for the formal prayer, then, wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows and wipe your heads and your feet up to the ankles. If you had been defiled, then, cleanse yourselves. And if you had been sick or on a journey or one of you drew near from the privy or you came into sexual contact with your wives and you find no water, then, aim at getting wholesome, dry earth and wipe your faces and hands with it. God wants not to make any impediment for you and He wants to purify you and to fulfill His divine blessing on you, so that perhaps you will give thanks"
  5,7,"And remember the divine blessing of God on you and His solemn promise that he made as a covenant with you by it when you said: We heard and we obeyed. And be Godfearing of God. Truly, God is Knowing of what is in the breasts"
  5,8,"O those who believed! Be staunch in equity as witnesses to God and let not that you detest a folk drive you into not dealing justly. Be just. That is nearer to God-consciousness. And be Godfearing of God. Truly, God is Aware of what you do"
  5,9,And God promised those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality that for them is forgiveness and a sublime compensation
