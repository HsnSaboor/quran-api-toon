quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Hadst thou seen him who was ungrateful for Our signs, who said: Will I be given wealth and children"
  19,78,Perused he the unseen or took he to himself a compact from The Merciful
  19,79,"No indeed! We will write down what he says. We will cause the punishment to increase for him, prolonging it"
  19,80,And We will inherit from him all that he says and he will approach Us individually
  19,81,And they took to themselves gods other than God that there be a triumph for them
  19,82,No indeed! They will disbelieve in what they worship and they will be taking a stand against them
  19,83,Hast thou not considered that We sent the satans against the ones who were ungrateful to confound them with confusion
  19,84,So hasten thou not against them. We only number for them a sum
  19,85,On the Day We will assemble the ones who are Godfearing to The Merciful like an entourage
  19,86,"And We will drive the ones who sin to hell, herding them"
  19,87,None of them will possess the power of intercession but such a one who took to himself a compact with The Merciful
  19,88,"And they said: The Merciful took to Himself a son"
  19,89,"Certainly, you brought about a disastrous thing"
  19,90,whereby the heavens are almost split asunder and the earth is split and the mountains fall crashing down
  19,91,that they attributed a son to The Merciful
  19,92,It is not fit and proper for The Merciful that He should take a son to Himself
  19,93,There is none at all in the heavens and the earth but he be one who arrives to The Merciful as a servant
  19,94,"Certainly, He counted for them and numbered up a sum"
  19,95,And every one of them will be ones who arrive to Him individually on the Day of Resurrection
