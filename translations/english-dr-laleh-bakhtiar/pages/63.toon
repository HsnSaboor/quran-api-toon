quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,"And how would you be ungrateful when the signs of God are recounted to you, and His Messenger is among you? And whoever cleaves firmly to God was, then, surely guided to a straight path"
  3,102,O those who believed! Be Godfearing of God as it is His right that He be feared. And die not but that you be ones who submit to the One God
  3,103,"And cleave firmly to the rope of God altogether and be not split up. And remember the divine blessing of God on you when you had been enemies. Then, He brought your hearts together. You became brothers/sisters by His divine blessing. You had been on the brink of an abyss of the fire and He saved you from it. Thus, God makes manifest to you His signs so that perhaps you will be truly guided"
  3,104,"And let there be a community from among you who calls to good and commands to that which is honorable and prohibits that which is unlawful. And those, they are the ones who prosper"
  3,105,"And be not like those who split up and were at variance after the clear portents drew near them. And those, for them is a tremendous punishment"
  3,106,"on a Day when faces will brighten and faces will cloud over. As for those whose faces cloud over: Disbelieve you after your belief? Then experience the punishment for what you had been ungrateful"
  3,107,"And as for those whose faces brightened, they are in the mercy of God. They, ones who will dwell in it forever"
  3,108,These are the signs of God. We recount them to thee in Truth. And God wants not injustice in the worlds
