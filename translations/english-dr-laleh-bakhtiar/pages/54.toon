  3,36,"Then, when she brought forth she said: My Lord! Truly, I brought her forth, a female. And God is greater in knowledge of what she brought forth. And the male is not like the female. And, truly, I named her Mary. And, truly, I commend her to Thy protection and her offspring from the accursed Satan"
  3,37,"So her Lord received her with the very best acceptance. And her bringing forth caused the very best to develop in her. And Zechariah took charge of her.

Truly, God provides to whom He wills without reckoning"
