quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the fig and the olive
  95,2,and by Mount Sinai
  95,3,and by this trustworthy land
  95,4,"truly, We have created the human being of the fairer symmetry"
  95,5,"Again, We returned him to the lowest of the low"
  95,6,"But those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, for them is compensation, that which is unfailing"
  95,7,What will cause thee to deny the Judgment after that
  95,8,Is not God The Most Just of ones who judge
  96,1,Recite in the Name of thy Lord Who created
  96,2,He created the human being from a clot
  96,3,"Recite: Thy Lord is the Most Generous"
  96,4,He Who taught by the pen
  96,5,He taught the human being what he knows not
  96,6,"No indeed! The human being is, truly, defiant"
  96,7,He considered himself self-sufficient
  96,8,"Truly, to thy Lord is the returning"
  96,9,Hast thou thyself considered he who prohibits
  96,10,a servant when he invoked blessings
  96,11,Hast thou considered if he had been on guidance
  96,12,or commanded God-consciousness
  96,13,Hast thou considered if he denied and turned away
  96,14,Knows he not that God sees
  96,15,"No indeed! Truly, if he refrains himself not, We will, surely, lay hold of him by the forelock"
  96,16,"a lying, inequitable forelock"
  96,17,And let him call to his conclave
  96,18,We will call to the guards of hell
  96,19,"No indeed! Truly, obey thou him not but prostrate thyself to God and be near to Him.‡"
