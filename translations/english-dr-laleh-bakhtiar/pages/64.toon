  3,109,And to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. To God all commands are returned
  3,110,"You had been the best community that was brought out for humanity. You command to that which is honorable and prohibit that which is unlawful and believe in God.

That is because they had been ungrateful for the signs of God and kill the Prophets without right. That is because they rebelled and had been exceeding the limits
  3,113,"They are not all the same. Among the People of the Book is a community of ones who are upstanding. They recount the signs of God in the night watch of the night and they, they prostrate themselves"
  3,114,They believe in God and the Last Day and they command that which is honorable and prohibit that which is unlawful and they compete with one another in good deeds. Those are among the ones in accord with morality
  3,115,And whatever of good they accomplish will never go unappreciated. And God is Knowing of the ones who are Godfearing
