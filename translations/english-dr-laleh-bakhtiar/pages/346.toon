quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,60,and those who give what they gave with their hearts afraid because they are ones who will return to their Lord
  23,61,"are those who compete with one another in good deeds and they, in them, are ones who take the lead"
  23,62,And We place not a burden on any soul but to its capacity. And from Us is a Book that speaks The Truth for itself. And they will not be wronged
  23,63,Nay! Their hearts are in obstinacy towards this Quran and they have other actions besides as they are ones who act
  23,64,"until, when We took ones who are given ease with the punishment. That is when they make entreaties"
  23,65,"Make not entreaties this Day. Truly, you will not be helped from Us"
  23,66,"Surely, My signs had been recounted to you, but you had been receding on your heels"
  23,67,"as ones who grow arrogant regarding it and ones who nightly talk nonsense, talking foolishly"
  23,68,"Meditate they not on the saying or drew not near them anything that approaches not their fathers, the ancient ones"
  23,69,Or is it they recognize not their Messenger so that they are ones who reject him
  23,70,"Or say they: There is madness in him? Nay! He drew near them with The Truth, but most of them are ones who dislike The Truth"
  23,71,"And if The Truth followed their desires, the heavens and the earth would have gone to ruin and whoever is in it. Nay! We brought them their Remembrance, but they, from their Remembrance, are ones who turn aside"
  23,72,Or is it that thou hast asked them for payment? Yet the revenue from thy Lord is better. And He is Best of the ones who provide
  23,73,"And, truly, thou hast called them to a straight path"
  23,74,"And, truly, those who believe not in the world to come are ones who move away from the path"
