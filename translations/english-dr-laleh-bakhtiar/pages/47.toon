quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"Those who consume usury will not arise, but like he who arises whom Satan prostrated by touch. That is because they said: Trading is only like usury and yet God permitted trading and forbade usury. So whoever drew near an admonishment from his Lord and refrained himself, for him is what was past. And his command is with God. While whoever reverted, then, those will be the Companions of the Fire. They, ones who will dwell in it forever"
  2,276,"God eliminates usury, and He causes charity to increase. And God loves not any sinful ingrate"
  2,277,"Truly, those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality and performed the formal prayer and gave the purifying alms, for them, their compensation is with their Lord. And there will be neither fear in them nor will they feel remorse"
  2,278,"O those who believed! Be Godfearing of God. And forsake what remained of usury, if you had been ones who believe"
  2,279,"But if you accomplish it not, then, give ear to war from God and His Messenger. And if you repented, you will have your principal capital, doing no wrong to others nor will you be wronged"
  2,280,"If a debtor had been possessing adversity, a respite until a time of ease and prosperity. And it is better for you that you be charitable, if you had been knowing"
  2,281,"And be Godfearing of a Day on which you are returned to God. Again, every soul will be paid its account in full for what it earned, and they will not be wronged"
