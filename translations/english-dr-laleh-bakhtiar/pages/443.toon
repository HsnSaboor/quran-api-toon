quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,A sign for them is that We carried their offspring in a laden boat
  36,42,And We created for them of its like that they ride
  36,43,"And if We will, We drown them with none for them to whom they cry aloud for help nor will they be saved"
  36,44,unless it be a mercy from Us and as an enjoyment for a while
  36,45,"And when it was said to them: Be Godfearing of what is in advance of you and what is behind you, so that perhaps you will find mercy"
  36,46,"there never approaches them any sign from the signs of their Lord, but they had been ones who turn aside from it"
  36,47,"And when it was said to them: Spend of whatever God provided you, those who were ungrateful said to those who believed: Will we feed him whom He would have fed, if He wills? You are nothing, but in a clear going astray"
  36,48,"And they say: When is this promise if you had been ones who are sincere"
  36,49,They expect but one Cry which will take them while they strive against one another
  36,50,"Then, they will not be able to leave a legacy nor will they return to their people"
  36,51,And the trumpet would be blown! That is when they will be sliding down to their Lord from their tombs
  36,52,"They would say: Woe on us! Who raised us up from our place of sleep? This is what The Merciful promised and the ones who are sent were sincere"
  36,53,"It would be but one Cry. That is when they will be in Our Presence altogether, ones who are charged"
  36,54,This Day no soul will be wronged at all nor will you be given recompense but for what you had been doing
