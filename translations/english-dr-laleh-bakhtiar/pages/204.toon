  9,110,"The structure they built will cease not the skepticism in their hearts until their hearts are cut asunder. And God is Knowing, Wise"
  9,111,"Truly, God bought from the ones who believe themselves and their properties. For them is the Garden! They fight in the way of God so they kill and are slain.
