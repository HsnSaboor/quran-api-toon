quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,No indeed! Nay! You love that which hastens away
  75,21,and forsake the world to come
  75,22,Faces on that Day will be ones that beam
  75,23,ones that look towards their Lord
  75,24,And faces on that day will be ones that scowl
  75,25,Thou will think that against them is wreaked a crushing calamity
  75,26,No indeed! When it reached the collar bones at death
  75,27,"and it was said: Where is one who is a wizard to save me"
  75,28,And he thought it to be his parting
  75,29,and one leg was intertwined with the other leg
  75,30,that Day he will be driving toward thy Lord
  75,31,for he established not the true nor invoked blessings
  75,32,and he denied and turned away
  75,33,"He went to his people again, going arrogantly"
  75,34,Closer to thee! And closer to thee
  75,35,Again closer to thee! And closer to thee
  75,36,Assumes the human being that he will be left aimless
  75,37,Was he not a sperm-drop to be emitted in seminal fluid
  75,38,"Again, he had been a clot and He created him and shaped him"
  75,39,"Then, He made of him two pairs, the male and the female"
  75,40,Is not that One Who Has Power over that able to give life to the dead
  76,1,Approached the human being a long course of time when he will be nothing remembered
  76,2,"Truly, We made the human being of a mingling of seminal fluid that We may test him. So We made him hearing, seeing"
  76,3,"Truly, We guided him on the way, whether he be one who is thankful or ungrateful"
  76,4,"Truly, We made ready for ones who are ungrateful chains and yokes and a blaze"
  76,5,"Truly, the pious will drink from a cup that had been a mixture of camphor"
