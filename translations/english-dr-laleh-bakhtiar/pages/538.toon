  57,4,"It is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days. Again, He turned His attention to the Throne.

And God is Seeing of what you do"

  57,10,And what is the matter with you that you spend not in the way of God while to God belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth?

And God is Aware of what you do
  57,11,Who is he who will lend to God a fairer loan that He multiply it for him and he will have a generous compensation
