quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun will be darkened
  81,2,and when the stars plunge down
  81,3,and when the mountains will be set in motion
  81,4,and when the pregnant camels are ignored
  81,5,and when the savage beasts will be assembled together
  81,6,and when the seas are caused to overflow
  81,7,and when the souls will be mated
  81,8,and when the buried infant girl will be asked
  81,9,for which impiety she was slain
  81,10,and when the scrolls will be unfolded
  81,11,and when the heaven is stripped off
  81,12,and when hellfire will be caused to burn fiercely
  81,13,and when the Garden will be brought close
  81,14,every soul will know to what it was prone
  81,15,So no! I swear an oath by the stars that recede
  81,16,"by the ones that run, the setting stars"
  81,17,and by the night when it swarmed
  81,18,"and by the morning, when it sighed"
  81,19,"truly, the Quran is a saying from a generous Messenger"
  81,20,"possessed of strength, with the Possessor of the Throne, secure"
  81,21,"one who is obeyed and, again, trustworthy"
  81,22,And your companion is not one who is possessed
  81,23,"And, certainly, he saw him on the clear horizon"
  81,24,And he is not avaricious for the unseen
  81,25,nor is it the saying of the accursed Satan
  81,26,So where are you going
  81,27,"Truly, it is not but a Remembrance to the worlds"
  81,28,to whoever among you willed to go straight
  81,29,"But you will not, unless God wills, the Lord of the worlds"
