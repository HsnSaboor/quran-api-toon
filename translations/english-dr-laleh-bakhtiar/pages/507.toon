quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,Those who were ungrateful and who barred from the way of God—He caused their actions to go astray
  47,2,And those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality and believed in what was sent down to Muhammad—for it is The Truth from their Lord—He will absolve them of their evil deeds and will make right their state of mind
  47,3,"That is because those who were ungrateful followed falsehood, while those who believed followed The Truth from their Lord. Thus, God propounds for humanity their parables"
  47,4,"So when you met those who were ungrateful, then, strike their thick necks until you gave them a sound thrashing. Then, tie them fast with restraints. And afterwards either have good will towards them or take ransom for them until the war ends, laying down its heavy load. Thus, it is so! But if God willed, He Himself would have, certainly, avenged you. But it is to try some of you with some others. As for those who were slain in the way of God, He will never cause their actions to go astray"
  47,5,He will guide them and He will make right their state of mind
  47,6,And He will cause them to enter the Garden with which He acquainted them
  47,7,"O those who believed! If you help God, He will help you and make firm your feet"
  47,8,"As for those who are ungrateful, for them is falling into ruin! And He caused their actions to go astray"
  47,9,That is because they disliked what God caused to descend so He caused their actions to fail
  47,10,Journey they not through the earth and look on how had been the Ultimate End of those who were before them? God destroyed them. And for ones who are ungrateful is its likeness
  47,11,"That is because God is the Defender of those who believed. And for the ones who are ungrateful, there is no defender of them"
