quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"who would say: Art thou of the ones who establish the Resurrection as true"
  37,53,"When we are dead and had been earth dust and bones, will we be ones who are judged"
  37,54,"He said: Will you be ones who peruse"
  37,55,So he perused and saw him amidst hellfire
  37,56,"He said: By God, thou wert about to deal me destruction"
  37,57,Had it not been for the divine blessing of my Lord I would have been of the ones who are charged
  37,58,"Are we not, then, to be dead again"
  37,59,but for our first death and will we not be ones who are punished
  37,60,"Truly, this, it is the winning the sublime triumph"
  37,61,"For the like of this, let the ones who work, work"
  37,62,Is this better as hospitality or the tree of Zaqqum
  37,63,"Truly, We made it a test for the ones who are unjust"
  37,64,"Truly, it is a tree that goes forth, its root in hellfire"
  37,65,its spathes have been like the heads of satans
  37,66,"So, truly, they, they are ones who eat from it, ones who fill their bellies with it"
  37,67,"Again, truly, on top of that for them is a brew of scalding water"
  37,68,"Again, truly, their return is to hellfire"
  37,69,They discovered their fathers ones who go astray
  37,70,yet they are running in their footsteps
  37,71,"And, certainly, went astray most of the ancient ones before them"
  37,72,"And, certainly, We sent among them ones who warn"
  37,73,"Then, look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who are warned"
  37,74,but the devoted servants of God
  37,75,"And, certainly, Noah cried out to Us. And how excellent were the ones who answer"
  37,76,And We delivered him and his people from tremendous distress
