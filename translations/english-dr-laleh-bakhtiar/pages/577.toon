quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,"Then, intercession will not profit them from the ones who are intercessors"
  74,49,"Then, what is the matter with them that they are ones who turn aside from the admonition"
  74,50,as though they had been frightened donkeys
  74,51,that ran away from a lion
  74,52,Nay! Every man among them wants to be given unrolled scrolls
  74,53,No indeed! Nay! They fear not the world to come
  74,54,"No indeed! Truly, it is an admonition"
  74,55,"So let whoever willed, remember it"
  74,56,But they will not remember unless God wills. He is Worthy of God-consciousness and He is Worthy of granting The Forgiveness
  75,1,I swear an oath by the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,And I swear an oath by the reproachful soul
  75,3,Assumes the human being that We will never gather his bones
  75,4,Yea! We are ones who have power to shape his fingers again
  75,5,Nay! The human being wants to act immorally in front of him
  75,6,"He asks: When is this Day of Resurrection"
  75,7,But when their sight will be astonished
  75,8,and the moon will cause the earth to be swallowed
  75,9,and the sun and the moon will be gathered
  75,10,"the human being will say on that Day: Where is a place to run away to"
  75,11,No indeed! There is no refuge
  75,12,With thy Lord on this Day will be thy recourse
  75,13,The human being will be told on that Day what he put forward and what he postponed
  75,14,Nay! The human being is clear evidence against himself
  75,15,And although he would cast his excuses
  75,16,impel not thy tongue to hasten it
  75,17,"Truly, on Us is his amassing and its Recitation"
  75,18,"But when We recited it, follow thou its Recitation"
  75,19,From Us after that is its clear explanation
