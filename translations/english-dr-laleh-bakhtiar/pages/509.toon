quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"And those who believed say: Why was a Chapter of the Quran not caused to descend? But when was caused to descend a definitive Chapter of the Quran and fighting was remembered in it, thou hadst seen those who in their hearts is a sickness looking on thee with the look of one who is fainting at death"
  47,21,"But better for them would be obedience and an honorable saying! And when the affair was resolved, then, if they were sincere to God, it would have been better for them"
  47,22,"Will it be that if you turned away, you would make corruption in the earth and cut off your ties with blood relations"
  47,23,"Those are those whom God cursed, so He made them unwilling to hear and their sight, unwilling to see"
  47,24,"Meditate they not, then, on the Quran or are there locks on their hearts"
  47,25,"Truly, those who went back—turn their back— after the guidance became clear to them, it was Satan who enticed them and He granted them indulgence"
  47,26,"That is because they said to those who disliked what God sent down: We will obey you in some of the affair. And God knows what they keep secret"
  47,27,"Then, how will it be for them when the angels will call them to themselves, striking their faces and their backs"
  47,28,That is because they followed what displeased God and they disliked His contentment so He caused their actions to fail
  47,29,Or assumed those who in their hearts is a sickness that God will never bring out their rancor
