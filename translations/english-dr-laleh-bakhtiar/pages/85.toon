quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,38,"and for those who spend their wealth to show off to humanity and believe neither in God nor in the Last Day. And to whomever Satan would be a comrade, then how evil a comrade"
  4,39,And what would be for them if they believed in God and the Last Day and spent out of what God provided them? God had been Knowing of them
  4,40,"Truly, God does not wrong even the weight of an atom. And if there be benevolence, He multiplies it and gives that which proceeds from His Presence a sublime compensation"
  4,41,"Then, how will it be when We brought about from each community a witness and We brought thee about as witness against these"
  4,42,On a Day those who were ungrateful and rebelled against the Messenger will wish that the earth be shaped over them but they will not keep back God’s discourse
  4,43,"O those who believed! Come not near the formal prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying nor defiled but as one who passes through a way until you wash yourselves. And if you had been sick or on a journey or one of you drew near from the privy or you came into sexual contact with your wives and you find no water, then, aim at getting wholesome, dry earth. Then, wipe your faces and your hands. Truly, God had been Pardoning, Forgiving"
  4,44,Hast thou not considered those who were given a share of the Book? They exchange fallacy and they want you to go astray from the way
