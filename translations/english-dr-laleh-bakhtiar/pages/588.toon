quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,"No indeed! Truly, the Book of the ones who act immorally is in Sijjin"
  83,8,And what will cause thee to recognize what Sijjin is
  83,9,It is a written book
  83,10,Woe on that Day to the ones who deny—
  83,11,those who deny the Day of Judgment
  83,12,"And none denies it but every sinful, exceeder of limits"
  83,13,"who, when Our signs are recounted to him, he said: Fables of the ancient ones"
  83,14,No indeed! Nay! Their hearts will be overcome with rust from what they had been earning
  83,15,No indeed! They will be from their Lord on that Day ones who are alienated
  83,16,"Truly, again, they will be ones who roast in hellfire"
  83,17,"Again, it will be said to them after that: This is what you had been denying"
  83,18,"No indeed! Truly, the book of the pious is in Illiyyun"
  83,19,And what will cause thee to recognize what Illiyyun is
  83,20,It is a written book
  83,21,Bearing witness to it are the ones who are brought near to God
  83,22,"Truly, the pious will be in bliss"
  83,23,"on raised benches, looking on"
  83,24,Thou wilt recognize on their faces the radiancy of bliss
  83,25,They will be given to drink sealed over exquisite wine
  83,26,"Its seal will have the lingering smell of musk. So for that, then, the ones who strive, strive"
  83,27,And the mixture will be of Tasnim
  83,28,a spring from which will drink the ones who are brought near to it
  83,29,"Truly, those who sinned—at those who believed—had been laughing"
  83,30,"And when they passed by them, they would wink at one another"
  83,31,"and when they would turn about to their people, they would turn about acting as ones who are unconcerned"
  83,32,"And when they saw them, they would say: Truly, these are ones who go astray"
  83,33,They were sent as ones who guard over them
  83,34,"Then, on this Day, those who believed laugh at the ones who are ungrateful"
