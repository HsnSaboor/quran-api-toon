  51,31,"Abraham said: O ones who are sent, what is your business"
  51,32,"They said: That we were sent to a folk, ones who sin"
  51,33,to send on them rocks of clay
  51,34,ones distinguished by thy Lord for ones who are excessive
  51,35,So We brought out whoever had been in it of the ones who believe
  51,36,But We found in it nothing but a house of ones who submit to God
  51,37,And We left a sign in it for those who fear the painful punishment
  51,38,"And in Moses, then, We sent him to Pharaoh with a clear authority"
  51,39,"Then, Pharaoh turned away to his court. He said: One who is a sorcerer, one who is possessed"
  51,40,So We took him and his armies and cast them forth into the water of the sea and he is one who is answerable
  51,41,"And in Ad, when We sent against them the withering wind"
  51,42,"It forsakes not anything it approached, but made it like it was decayed"
  51,43,"And in Thamud, when it was said to them: Take joy for a while"
  51,44,Yet they defied the command of their Lord so the thunderbolt took them while they look on
  51,45,They were neither able to stand up nor had they been ones who are aided
  51,46,"And the folk of Noah from before. Truly, they had been a folk, ones who disobey"
  51,47,"And We built the heaven with potency. And, truly, We are ones who extend wide"
  51,48,"And the earth, We spread it forth. How excellent are the ones who spread"
  51,49,And of everything We created pairs so that perhaps you will recollect
  51,50,"So run away towards God. Truly, I am to you a clear warner from Him"
  51,51,"And make not with God any other god. Truly, I am to you a clear warner from Him"
