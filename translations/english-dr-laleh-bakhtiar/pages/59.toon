quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,71,"O People of the Book! Why confuse you The Truth with falsehood, and keep back The Truth while you know"
  3,72,"And a section of the People of the Book said: Believe in what was caused to descend to those who believed at the beginning of the daytime. Disbelieve at the last of the day so that perhaps they will return to disbelief"
  3,73,"And believe none, but one who heeded your way of life. Say: Truly guidance is The Guidance from God and believe not that anyone be given the like of what you were given, so that he argue with you before your Lord. Say: Truly, the grace is in the hand of God. He gives it to whomever He wills. And God is One Who is Extensive, Knowing"
  3,74,He singles out for His mercy whom He wills. And God is Possessor of Sublime Grace
  3,75,"And among the People of the Book is he who, if thou hast entrusted him with a hundredweight, he would give it back to thee. And among them is he who, if thou hast entrusted him with a dinar, he would not give it back to thee unless thou hadst continued as one who stands over him. That is because they said: There is no way of moral duty on us as to the unlettered. And they are lying against God while they, they know"
  3,76,"Yea! Whoever lived up to his compact and was Godfearing, then, truly, God loves the ones who are Godfearing"
  3,77,"Truly, those who exchange the compact of God and their sworn oaths for a little price, those, there is no apportionment for them in the world to come. And God will neither speak to them, nor look on them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He make them pure. And for them is a painful punishment"
