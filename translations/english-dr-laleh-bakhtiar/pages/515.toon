quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  48,29,"Muhammad is the Messenger of God. And those who are with him are severe against the one who is ungrateful, but compassionate among themselves. Thou hast seen them as ones who bow down as ones who prostrate themselves. They are looking for grace from God and contentment. Their mark is on their faces from the effects of prostration. This is their parable in the Torah. And their parable in the Gospel is like sown seed that brought out its shoot, energized. It, then, became stout and rose straight on its plant stalk impressing the ones who sow so that He enrage by them the ones who are ungrateful, God promised those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, for them forgiveness and a sublime compensation"
  49,1,"O those who believed! Put not yourselves forward in advance of God and His Messenger. And be Godfearing of God. Truly, God is Hearing, Knowing"
  49,2,O those who believed! Exalt not your voices above the voice of the Prophet nor publish a saying to him as you would openly publish something to some others so that your actions not be fruitless while you are not aware
  49,3,"Truly, those who lower their voices near the Messenger of God, those are those who are ones God put to test their hearts for God-consciousness. For them is forgiveness and a sublime compensation"
  49,4,"Truly, those who cry out to thee from behind the inner apartments, most of them are not reasonable"
