  80,6,"then, thou hast attended to him"
  80,7,and not upon thee is any blame if he purifies not himself
  80,8,"Yet as for him who drew near to thee, coming eagerly for knowledge"
  80,9,and he dreads God
  80,10,"then, thou hast paid no heed to him"
  80,11,"No indeed! Truly, this is an admonition"
  80,12,"So let whoever willed, remember it"
  80,13,in scrolls to be held in esteem
  80,14,ones that are exalted and ones that are purified
  80,15,by the hands of generous writers
  80,16,"and ones who are kindly, generous"

  80,18,From which thing did He create him
  80,19,"He created him from seminal fluid then, ordained that he be"

  80,35,and his mother and his father
  80,36,and his companion wife and his children
  80,37,For every man of them on that Day will be a matter that will preoccupy him
  80,38,Faces that Day will be ones that are polished
  80,39,ones who are laugh and ones who rejoice at good tidings
  80,40,And faces on that Day will be dust-stained
  80,41,Gloom will come over them
  80,42,"Those, they are the ones who are ungrateful, ones who act immorally"
