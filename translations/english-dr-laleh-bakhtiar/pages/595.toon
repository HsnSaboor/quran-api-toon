quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and its forenoon
  91,2,and by the moon when it related to it
  91,3,and by the daytime when it displayed it
  91,4,and by the nighttime when it overcomes it
  91,5,and by the heaven and what built it
  91,6,and by the earth and what widened it
  91,7,and by the soul and what shaped it
  91,8,"and, then, inspired it to its acting immorally and God-consciousness"
  91,9,he who made it pure prospered
  91,10,"Surely, is frustrated whoever seduced it"
  91,11,Thamud denied because of their overboldness
  91,12,When the disappointed among them were aroused
  91,13,"and the Messenger of God said to them: Allow watering to the she-camel of God"
  91,14,"Then, they denied him; then, they crippled her. So their Lord doomed them for their impiety"
  91,15,"Then, He leveled them. And He fears not its Ultimate End"
  92,1,By the nighttime when it overcomes
  92,2,by the daytime when it self-disclosed
  92,3,by Him Who created the male and the female
  92,4,"truly, your endeavoring is diverse"
  92,5,As for him who gave and was Godfearing
  92,6,and established the fairer as true
  92,7,We will make easy for him the easing
  92,8,And as for him who was a miser and was self-sufficient
  92,9,and denied the fairer
  92,10,We will make falling into difficulty easy for him
  92,11,And his wealth will not avail him when he succumbed
  92,12,"Truly, guidance is from Us"
  92,13,"and, truly, to Us belongs the last and the first"
  92,14,I warned you of a fire that blazes fiercely
