quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,11,"truly, those who drew near with the calumny are many among you. Assume it not worse for you. Nay! It is good for you. To every man of them is what he deserved of sin. And as for those who turned away towards the greater part from among them, there will be a tremendous punishment for him"
  24,12,"Why not when you heard about it, thought not the ones who are male believers and the ones who are female believers the better of themselves and have said: This is a clear calumny"
  24,13,"Why brought they not about four witnesses for it? As they bring not about witnesses, then, with God, those, they are the ones who lie"
  24,14,"If it not were for the grace of God on you and His mercy in the present and in the world to come, certainly, would have afflicted you a tremendous punishment for what you muttered"
  24,15,"When you received it on your tongues and said with your mouths of what there is no knowledge, you assume it insignificant while it is serious with God"
  24,16,"And why, when you heard it, said you not: It will not be for us to assert this. Glory be to Thee! This is a serious false charge to harm the reputation of another"
  24,17,"God admonishes you that you shall never revert to the like of it, if you had been ones who believe"
  24,18,"And He makes manifest for you the signs. And God is Knowing, Wise"
  24,19,"Truly, those who love that indecency be spread about those who believed, they will have a painful punishment in the present and in the world to come. And God knows and you know not"
  24,20,"And if it were not for the grace of God on you and His mercy, you would be ruined, and that God is Gentle, Compassionate"
