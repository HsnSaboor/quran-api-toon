quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,And how many We caused to perish before them of generations who were stronger than they in courage so that they searched about on the land. Was there any asylum
  50,37,"Truly, in that is a reminder for him, for whoever had a heart or, having the ability to hear, gave listen. He is a witness"
  50,38,"And, certainly, We created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between in six days, and no exhaustion afflicted Us"
  50,39,So have thou patience with whatever they say and glorify with the praise of thy Lord before the coming up of the sun and before sunset
  50,40,And in the night glorify Him and at the end part of the prostrations
  50,41,And listen thou on a Day when one who calls out will cry out from a near place
  50,42,On a Day when they will hear the Cry with The Truth. That will be the Day of going forth
  50,43,"Truly, it is We who give life and cause to die and to Us is the Homecoming"
  50,44,on a Day when the earth will be split open swiftly. That will be an easy assembling for Us
  50,45,We are greater in knowledge as to what they say. And thou art not haughty over them so remind by the Quran whoever fears My threat
  51,1,By the winnowing winds of ones that winnow
  51,2,"by the burden-bearers, the ones who carry a heavy burden"
  51,3,and the ones that run with ease
  51,4,and the ones who distribute the command
  51,5,"truly, what you are promised is that which is sincere"
  51,6,"And, truly, the judgment is that which falls"
