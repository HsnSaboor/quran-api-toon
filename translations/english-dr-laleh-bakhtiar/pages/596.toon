quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,It roasts none but the vile
  92,16,who denied and turned away
  92,17,But the devout will be caused to turn aside from it
  92,18,He who gives of his wealth to purify himself
  92,19,and with him there is none for which recompense is expected to be given for divine blessing
  92,20,"but looking for the Countenance of his Lord, The Lofty"
  92,21,he will be well-pleased
  93,1,By the forenoon
  93,2,and by the night when it brooded
  93,3,"thy Lord deserted thee not, nor is He in hatred of thee"
  93,4,"Truly, the last will be better for thee than the first"
  93,5,"And thy Lord will give to thee. Then, thou wilt be well-pleased"
  93,6,Found He thee not an orphan and He gave thee refuge
  93,7,"And found He thee one who goes astray, then, He guided thee"
  93,8,"And found He thee one who wants, then, He enriched thee"
  93,9,"So as for the orphan, oppress him not"
  93,10,"And as for one who begs, scold him not"
  93,11,"And as for the divine blessing of thy Lord, divulge it"
  94,1,Expand We not thy breast
  94,2,and lifted from thee the heavy loaded burden
  94,3,that weighed heavily on thy back
  94,4,Exalted We not thy remembrance
  94,5,"So, truly, with hardship, ease"
  94,6,"Truly, with hardship, ease"
  94,7,"When thou hadst finished thy duties, then, work on supplication"
  94,8,and quest thy Lord
