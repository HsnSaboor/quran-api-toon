quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the dawn
  89,2,and the ten nights
  89,3,by the even number and the odd number
  89,4,and at night when it sets out
  89,5,Is there not in that an oath to be sworn for a possessor of intelligence
  89,6,Hast thou not considered how thy Lord accomplished with Ad
  89,7,with Iram of the pillars
  89,8,of which are not created the likes in the land
  89,9,"And with Thamud, those who hollowed out the rocks in the valley"
  89,10,"And with Pharaoh, the possessor of the stakes"
  89,11,those who were defiant in the land
  89,12,and made much corruption in it
  89,13,So thy Lord unloosed on them a scourge of punishment
  89,14,"Truly, thy Lord is, surely, on the watch"
  89,15,"Then, as for the human being, when his Lord tested him and honored him and lauded him, he says: My Lord honored me"
  89,16,"But whenever He tested him and constricted his provision for him, he says: My Lord despised me"
  89,17,No indeed! Nay! You honor not the orphan
  89,18,and you encouraged not one another about food for the needy
  89,19,"and you consume the inheritance, a greedy consuming"
  89,20,and you love wealth with an ardent cherishing
  89,21,"No indeed! When the earth will be ground to powder, ground to powder, ground to powder"
  89,22,"and thy Lord will draw near, and the angels, ranged in rows"
  89,23,on the Day hell is brought about. On that Day the human being will recollect. And how will the reminder be for him
