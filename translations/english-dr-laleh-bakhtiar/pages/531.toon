quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,and Our command is not but one as the twinkling of the eye
  54,51,"And, certainly, We caused to perish their partisans. Is there, then, one who recalls"
  54,52,And everything they accomplished is in the ancient scrolls
  54,53,And every small and great thing is that which is written
  54,54,"Truly, the ones who are Godfearing will be in Gardens and rivers"
  54,55,in positions of sincerity near an Omnipotent King
  55,1,The Merciful
  55,2,He taught the Quran
  55,3,He created the human being
  55,4,He taught him the clear explanation
  55,5,The sun and the moon are to keep count
  55,6,And the stars and the trees both prostrate
  55,7,And the heaven He exalted. And He set in place the Balance
  55,8,that you be not defiant in the Balance
  55,9,Set up the weighing with justice and skimp not in the Balance
  55,10,And He set the earth in place for the human race
  55,11,On and in it are many kinds of sweet fruit and date palm trees with sheathed fruit trees
  55,12,and grain possessor of husks and fragrant herbs
  55,13,So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
  55,14,He created the human being from earth mud like potter’s clay
  55,15,He created the ones who are spirits from a smokeless flame of fire
  55,16,So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
