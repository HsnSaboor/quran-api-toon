quran[9]{c,v,t}:

  10,35,"Say: Are there among your ascribed associates with God anyone who guides to The Truth? Say: God guides to The Truth. Has not He who guides to The Truth a better right to be followed than he who guides not unless he himself be guided? What is the matter with you? How you give judgment"
  10,36,"And most of them follow nothing but opinion. Truly, opinion avails them not against The Truth at all. Truly, God is Knowing of what they accomplish"

  10,38,"Or they will say: He devised it. Say: Bring a Chapter of the Quran like it and call to whomever you were able—other than God—if you had been ones who are sincere"
  10,39,"Nay! They denied the knowledge that they comprehend not while approaches them not the interpretation. Thus, those who were before them denied. So look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who are unjust"
  10,40,And of them are some who believe in it and of them are some who believe not in it. And thy Lord is greater in knowledge of the ones who make corruption
  10,41,"And if they denied thee, then, thou say: For me are my actions and for you are your actions. You are free of what I do and I am free of what you do"
  10,42,"And among them are some who listen to thee. So hast thou caused someone unwilling to hear, to hear if they had not been reasonable"
