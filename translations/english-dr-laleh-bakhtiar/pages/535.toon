quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,Immortal children go around them
  56,18,with cups and ewers and goblets from a spring of water
  56,19,Neither will they suffer headaches nor will they be intoxicated
  56,20,and sweet fruit of what they specify
  56,21,and the flesh of birds for which they lust
  56,22,and most beautiful eyed ones
  56,23,like the parable of the well-guarded pearls
  56,24,a recompense for what they had been doing
  56,25,They will not hear any idle talk in it nor accusation of sinfulness
  56,26,"but the saying of: Peace! Peace"
  56,27,And the Companions of the Right—who are the Companions of the Right
  56,28,They will be among thornless lote-trees
  56,29,"and acacias, one on another"
  56,30,and spread out shade
  56,31,and outpoured water
  56,32,and many sweet fruit
  56,33,There will be neither that which is severed nor that which is inaccessible
  56,34,And it is an exalted place of restfulness
  56,35,"Truly, We caused them (f) to grow, a good forming"
  56,36,and made them (f) virgins
  56,37,"full of love, of the same age"
  56,38,for the Companions of the Right
  56,39,A throng of the ancient ones
  56,40,and a throng from the later ones
  56,41,and the Companions of the Left—who are the Companions of the Left
  56,42,Those who are in burning wind and scalding water
  56,43,and shade of black smoke
  56,44,neither that which is cool nor generous
  56,45,"Truly, they had been before that ones who are given ease"
  56,46,and they had been persisting in tremendous wickedness
  56,47,"And they had been saying: When we died and had been earth dust and bones, will we, then, be ones who are raised up"
  56,48,And our ancient fathers
  56,49,"Say: Truly, the ancient ones and the later ones"
  56,50,will be ones who will be gathered to a time appointed on a known Day
