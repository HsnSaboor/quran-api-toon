quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,"Truly, he deliberated and calculated"
  74,19,"Then, perdition to him! How he calculated"
  74,20,"Again, perdition to him! How he calculated"
  74,21,"Again, he looked on"
  74,22,"and, again, he frowned and scowled"
  74,23,"Again, he drew back and grew arrogant"
  74,24,"And he said: This is nothing but fabricated old sorcery"
  74,25,This is nothing but the saying of a mortal
  74,26,I will scorch him in Saqar
  74,27,And how will thee recognize what Saqar is
  74,28,It forsakes not nor causes anything to remain
  74,29,scorching the mortal
  74,30,Over it there are nineteen
  74,31,"We assigned none but angels to be wardens of the Fire and We made the amount of them not but as a test for those who were ungrateful. So those who were given the Book are reassured and those who believed, add to their belief. And will not doubt those who were given the Book and the ones who believe. And say to those who in their hearts is a sickness and the ones who are ungrateful: What had God wanted by this example? Thus, God causes to go astray whom He wills, and He guides whom He wills. And none knows the armies of thy Lord but He. And it is not other than a reminder for the mortals"
  74,32,No indeed! By the moon
  74,33,and the night when it drew back
  74,34,and polished is the morning
  74,35,"Truly, it is one of the greatest of all things"
  74,36,as a warner to the mortals
  74,37,to whomever willed among you that he go forward or remain behind
  74,38,Every soul is a pledge for what it earned
  74,39,but the Companions of the Right
  74,40,will be in Gardens and will demand of one another
  74,41,about the ones who sin
  74,42,What thrust you into Saqar
  74,43,"They would say: We be not among the ones who formally pray"
  74,44,and we were not those who feed the needy
  74,45,And we had been ones who engage in idle talk along with the ones who engage in idle talk
  74,46,And we had been denying the Day of Judgment
  74,47,until the certainty of the Hour approached us
