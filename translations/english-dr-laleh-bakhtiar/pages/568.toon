quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,This day he is not to have any loyal friend here
  69,36,"and no food, but foul pus"
  69,37,which none eat but ones of inequity
  69,38,So I swear an oath by what you perceive
  69,39,and what you perceive not
  69,40,"Truly, it is the saying of a generous Messenger"
  69,41,and not the saying of a poet. Little do you believe
  69,42,Nor is it the saying of a soothsayer. Little do you recollect
  69,43,It is a sending down from the Lord of the worlds
  69,44,And if he fabricated against Us some sayings
  69,45,"truly, We would have taken him by the right hand"
  69,46,"and, again, We would have severed his life-vein"
  69,47,And there is none of you who would be ones who hinder Us from him
  69,48,"And, truly, it is an admonition to ones who are Godfearing"
  69,49,"And We well know that there are among you, ones who deny"
  69,50,"And, truly, it will be a regret for ones who are ungrateful"
  69,51,"And, truly, it is The Truth of certainty"
  69,52,"So glorify the Name of thy Lord, The Sublime"
  70,1,One who supplicates asked for a punishment that will fall
  70,2,on the ones who are ungrateful for which there will be no one to avert
  70,3,"from God, the Possessor of the Stairways of Ascent"
  70,4,The angels and the Spirit go up to Him on a Day whose measure had been fifty thousand years
  70,5,So have thou patience with a graceful patience
  70,6,"Truly, they see it as distant"
  70,7,but We see it as near at hand
  70,8,On a Day the heaven will become as molten copper
  70,9,and the mountains be as wool clusters
  70,10,and no loyal friend will ask a loyal friend
