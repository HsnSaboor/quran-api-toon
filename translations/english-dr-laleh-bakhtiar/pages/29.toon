quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,187,"It is permitted for you on the nights of formal fasting to have sexual intercourse with your wives. They (f) are a garment for you and you are a garment for them (f). God knew that you had been dishonest to yourselves so He turned to you in forgiveness and pardoned you. So now lie with them (f) and look for what God prescribed for you. And eat and drink until the white thread becomes clear to you from the black thread at dawn. Again, fulfill the formal fasting until night. And lie not with them (f) when you are ones who cleave to the places of prostration. These are the ordinances of God. Then, come not near them. Thus, God makes His signs manifest to humanity so that perhaps they will be Godfearing"
  2,188,"And consume not your wealth between yourselves in falsehood, nor let it down in bribes to the ones who judge so that you consume a group of people’s wealth among humanity in sin while you know"
  2,189,"They ask thee about the new moons. Say: They are appointed times for humanity, and the pilgrimage to Makkah. It is not virtuous conduct that you approach houses from the back. Rather, virtuous conduct was to be Godfearing, and approach houses from their front doors. And be Godfearing of God so that perhaps you will prosper"
  2,190,"And fight in the Way of God those who fight you, but exceed not the limits. Truly, God loves not the ones who exceed the limits"
