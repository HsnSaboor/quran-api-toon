quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,1,"They ask thee about the spoils of war. Say: The spoils of war belong to God and the Messenger so be Godfearing of God and make things right among you and obey God and his Messenger if you had been ones who believe"
  8,2,"The ones who believe are only those whose hearts took notice when God was remembered. When His signs were recounted to them, their belief increased and they put their trust in the Lord—"
  8,3,those who perform the formal prayer and spend out of what We provided them
  8,4,"those, they are the ones who truthfully believe. For them are degrees with their Lord and forgiveness and generous provision"
  8,5,"Just as thy Lord brought thee out from thy house with The Truth, and, truly, a group of people among the ones who believe were the ones who dislike it"
  8,6,They dispute with thee about The Truth—after it became clear—as if they had been driven to death and they look on at it
  8,7,"And when God promises you, one of the two sections: It will, truly, be for you. And you wish that the one that is unarmed should be yours. And God wants that He verify The Truth by His Words and to sever the last remnant of the ones who are ungrateful"
  8,8,that He may verify The Truth and render the falsehood untrue even if the ones who sin disliked it
