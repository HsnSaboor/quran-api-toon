quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,For the solidarity of the Quraysh
  106,2,their solidarity is the winter and the summer travel
  106,3,Let them worship the Lord of this House
  106,4,Who fed them against hunger and secured them against fear
  107,1,Hadst thou considered one who denies this way of life
  107,2,And that is he who drives away with force the orphan
  107,3,and urges not to give food to the needy
  107,4,So woe to ones who formally pray
  107,5,ones who are inattentive to their formal prayers
  107,6,those who make display
  107,7,yet they repulse giving the assistance
  108,1,"Truly, We gave thee the abundance"
  108,2,So invoke blessings for thy Lord and make sacrifice
  108,3,"Truly, the one who detests thee, he is the one who is cut off"
