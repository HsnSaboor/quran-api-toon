  62,2,"He it is Who raised up among the unlettered a Messenger from among them who recounts His signs to them and makes them pure and teaches them the Book and wisdom even though they had been before certainly, clearly going astray"
  62,3,"and to others among them who join them not. And He is The Almighty, The Wise"
  62,4,That is the grace of God. He gives it to whom He wills. And God is Possessor of the Sublime Grace
  62,5,"The parable of those who were entrusted with the Torah, and, again, carries it not is as the parable of a donkey who carries writings. Miserable was the parable of a folk who denied the signs of God! And God guides not the folk, the ones who are unjust"
  62,6,"Say: O those who became Jews! If you claimed that you are the protectors of God to the exclusion of humanity, then, covet death if you had been ones who are sincere"

  62,8,"Say: Truly, the death that you run away from, then, it will be, truly, that which you encounter. Again, you will be returned to the One Who Knows of the unseen and the visible and He will tell you what you had been doing"
