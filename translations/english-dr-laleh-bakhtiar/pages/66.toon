  3,124,"Mention when thou hast said to the ones who believe: Suffices you not that your Lord will reinforce you with three thousand among the angels? Ones who are caused to descend"
  3,125,"yea! if you endure patiently and are Godfearing? And if they approach you instantly here, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels—ones who are sweeping on"
  3,126,"And God made it but as good tidings to you so that with it your hearts will be at rest. And there is no help, but from God, The Almighty, The Wise"
  3,127,for He will sever a selection of those who were ungrateful or suppress them so they turn about as ones who are frustrated

  3,129,"And to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And God is Forgiving, Compassionate"
  3,130,O those who believed! Consume not usury—that which is doubled and redoubled—and be Godfearing of God so that perhaps you will prosper
  3,131,And be Godfearing of the fire that was prepared for the ones who are ungrateful
  3,132,And obey God and the Messenger so that perhaps you will find mercy
