quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  19,12,O Yahya! Take the Book with strength. And We gave him critical judgment while a lad
  19,13,and Our continuous mercy from that which proceeds from Our Presence and purity and he had been devout
  19,14,and pious to ones who are his parents and be not haughty nor rebellious
  19,15,"And peace be on him the day on which he was given birth and the day he dies and the day he is raised up, living"
  19,16,And remember Mary in the Book when she went apart from her people to an eastern place

  19,18,"She said: Truly, I take refuge in The Merciful from thee; come not near me if thou hadst been devout"

  19,20,"She said: How will I have a boy when no mortal touches me, nor am I an unchaste woman"
  19,21,"He said: Thus, it will be. Thy Lord said: It is for Me insignificant. And: We will assign him as a sign for humanity and as a mercy from Us. And it had been that which is a decreed command"

  19,23,"And the birth pangs surprised her at the trunk of a date palm tree. She said: O would that I had died before this and I had been one who is forgotten, a forgotten thing"
  19,24,"So he cried out to her from beneath her: Feel not remorse! Surely, thy Lord made under thee (f) a brook"
  19,25,"And shake towards thee (f) the trunk of the date palm tree. It will cause ripe, fresh dates to fall on thee"
