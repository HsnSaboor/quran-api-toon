quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star when it hurled to ruin
  53,2,"neither your companion went astray, nor he erred"
  53,3,nor speaks he for himself out of desire
  53,4,It is but a revelation that is revealed
  53,5,taught to him by The One Stronger in Strength
  53,6,"Possessor of Forcefulness. Then, he stood poised"
  53,7,while he was on the loftiest horizon
  53,8,"Again, he came to pass near and hung suspended"
  53,9,until he had been at a distance of two bow lengths or closer
  53,10,"Then, He revealed to His servant what He revealed"
  53,11,The mind lied not against what it saw
  53,12,Will you altercate with him about what he sees
  53,13,"And, certainly, he saw it another time"
  53,14,near the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary
  53,15,near which is the Garden of the Place of Shelter
  53,16,when overcomes the Lote Tree what overcomes it
  53,17,"The sight swerved not, nor was it defiant"
  53,18,"Certainly, he saw some of the greatest signs of his Lord"
  53,19,"Saw you, then, al-Lat and al-Uzza"
  53,20,"and Manat, the third, the other"
  53,21,"Have you males and has He, females"
  53,22,"That, then, is an unfair division"
  53,23,"They are but names that you named, you and your fathers, for which God caused not to descend any authority. They follow nothing but opinion and that for which their souls yearn. And, certainly, drew near them the guidance from their Lord"
  53,24,Or will the human being have what he coveted
  53,25,"Then, to God belongs the Last and the First"
  53,26,"And how many an angel in the heavens is there whose intercession will avail nothing at all, but after God gives permission to whom He wills and He is well-pleased"
