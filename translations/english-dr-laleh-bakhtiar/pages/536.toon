  56,51,"Again, you, O ones who go astray, are the ones who deny"
  56,52,"Certainly, you will be ones who eat from the Zaqqum tree"
  56,53,"Then, you will be ones who fill your bellies from it"
  56,54,"then, ones who drink scalding water after it"
  56,55,So you will be ones who drink like the drinking of thirsty camels
  56,56,This will be their hospitality on the Day of Judgment
  56,57,"We, We created you. Why establish it not as true"
  56,58,Considered you what you spill of human seed
  56,59,Is it you who create it? Or are We the ones who are the creators
  56,60,We ordained death among you and We will not be ones who will be outrun
  56,61,in that We will substitute your likeness and We caused you to grow in a way you know not
  56,62,"And, certainly, you knew the first growth. Will you not, then, recollect"
  56,63,Considered you the soil that you till
  56,64,Is it you who sows it? Or are We the ones who sow
  56,65,"If We will, We would make it into chaff and you would continue to joke saying"
  56,66,We are ones who are debt-loaded
  56,67,Nay! We are ones who are deprived
  56,68,Considered you the water that you drink
  56,69,Is it you who caused it to descend from the cloud vapors? Or are We the ones who caused it to descend
  56,70,"If We will, We would make it bitter. Why, then, give you not thanks"
  56,71,Considered you the fire which you strike
  56,72,Is it you who caused the tree to grow? Or are We the ones who cause it to grow
  56,73,We made it an admonition and sustenance for ones who are desert people
  56,74,"Then, glorify with the name of thy Lord, The Sublime"
  56,75,But no! I swear by the orbit of the stars
  56,76,"and, truly, that is an oath to be sworn if you know, sublime"
