quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,Nay! You hold this present life in greater favor
  87,17,"yet the world to come is better, and one that endures"
  87,18,"Truly, this is in the previous scrolls"
  87,19,the scrolls of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Approached thee the discourse of the Overwhelming Event
  88,2,Faces on that Day will be ones that are humbled
  88,3,ones that work and ones that are fatigued
  88,4,roasting in a hot fire
  88,5,They will be given to drink from boiling receptacles
  88,6,Is it not that there is no food for them but a thorny fruit
  88,7,It will not fatten nor will it avail hunger
  88,8,Faces on that Day will be ones that are pleasant
  88,9,ones who are well-pleased by their endeavoring
  88,10,in a magnificent Garden
  88,11,They will hear no babble in it
  88,12,In it is a running spring
  88,13,In it are exalted couches
  88,14,and goblets that are set down
  88,15,and cushions arrayed
  88,16,"and rugs, ones that are dispersed"
  88,17,"Will they not, then, look on the camel, how it was created"
  88,18,"And of the heaven, how it was lifted up"
  88,19,"And the mountains, how they were hoisted up"
  88,20,"And the earth, how it was stretched out"
  88,21,"Then, remind for thou art only one who reminds"
  88,22,Thou art not over them one who is a register of their deeds
  88,23,But whoever turned away and is one who is ungrateful
  88,24,God will punish him with the greater punishment
  88,25,"Truly, to Us is their reversion"
  88,26,"Again, truly, on Us is their reckoning"
