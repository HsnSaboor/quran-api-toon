quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,when his Lord cried out to him in the sanctified valley of Tuwa
  79,17,"Be thou gone to Pharaoh. Truly, he was defiant"
  79,18,"And say: Wouldst thou purify thyself"
  79,19,"And I will guide thee to thy Lord, then, thou wilt dread Him"
  79,20,And he caused him to see the greater sign
  79,21,But Pharaoh denied and rebelled
  79,22,"Again, Pharaoh drew back, hastening about"
  79,23,"Then, Pharaoh assembled them; then, proclaimed"
  79,24,"Then, Pharaoh said: I am your lofty lord"
  79,25,So God took him with an exemplary punishment for the last and for the first
  79,26,"Truly, in that is a lesson for whoever dreads God"
  79,27,Is your constitution harder to create or the heaven which He built
  79,28,He exalted its vault and shaped it
  79,29,and He made its night dark and brought out its forenoon
  79,30,"And, after that, He spread out the earth"
  79,31,He brought out from it its water and its pasture
  79,32,And the mountains He set firm
  79,33,an enjoyment for you and for your flocks
  79,34,When the Greater Catastrophe would draw near
  79,35,on that Day the human being will recollect for what he endeavored
  79,36,Hellfire will be advanced for whoever sees
  79,37,As for whoever was defiant
  79,38,and held this present life in greater favor
  79,39,"then, truly, hellfire will be the place of shelter"
  79,40,And as for him who feared the Station of his Lord and prohibited desire from his soul
  79,41,"truly, the Garden will be the place of shelter"
  79,42,They ask thee about the Hour. When will it berth
  79,43,"Then, what art thou about that thou remind of it"
  79,44,To thy Lord is the Utmost Boundary of it
  79,45,And thou art only one who warns to such a one whoever dreads it
  79,46,"It will be as though a Day they see it, they linger not in expectation but an evening or a forenoon"
