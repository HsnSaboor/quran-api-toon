quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  49,12,"O those who believed! Avoid suspicion much. Truly, some suspicion is a sin. And spy not nor backbite some by some other. Would one of you love to eat the flesh of his lifeless brother? You would have disliked it. And be Godfearing of God. Truly, God is Accepter of Repentance, Compassionate"
  49,13,"O humanity! Truly, We created you from a male and a female and made you into peoples and types that you recognize one another. Truly, the most generous of you with God is the most devout. Truly, God is Knowing, Aware"
  49,14,"The nomads said: We believed. Say to them: You believe not. But say: We submitted to God, for belief enters not yet into your hearts. But if you obey God and His Messenger, He will not withhold your actions at all. Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate"
  49,15,"The ones who believe are not but those who believed in God and His Messenger. Again, they were not in doubt and they struggled with their wealth and themselves in the way of God. Those, they are the ones who are sincere"
  49,16,"Say: Would you teach God about your way of life while God knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth? And God is Knowing of everything"
  49,17,"They show grace to thee that they submitted to God. Say: Show you submission to God as grace to me? Nay! God shows grace to you in that He guided you to belief if you, truly, had been ones who are sincere"
  49,18,"Truly, God knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth. And God is Seeing of what you do"
