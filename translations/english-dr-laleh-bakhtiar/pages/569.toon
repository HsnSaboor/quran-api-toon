quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,although they are given sight of them. One who sins would wish that he offer for ransom —from the punishment of that day—his children
  70,12,"or his companion wife, or his brother"
  70,13,or his relatives who gave him refuge
  70,14,"or whoever is on the earth altogether, again, if that would rescue him"
  70,15,"No indeed. Truly, it is the furnace of hell"
  70,16,removing their scalps
  70,17,calling whoever drew back and turned away
  70,18,and gathered wealth and amassed
  70,19,"Truly, the human being was created fretful"
  70,20,"When the worst afflicted him, he is impatient"
  70,21,"And when the good afflicted him, begrudging"
  70,22,But the ones who formally pray
  70,23,"those, they are ones who continue with their formal prayers"
  70,24,and those who in their wealth there is a known obligation towards
  70,25,the one who begs and the one who is deprived
  70,26,and those who sincerely validate the Day of Judgment
  70,27,"And those, they are ones who are apprehensive of the punishment of their Lord"
  70,28,"Truly, as to the punishment of their Lord, there is no one who is safe from it"
  70,29,"Those, they are ones who guard their private parts"
  70,30,"but not from their spouses or what their right hands possessed. Truly, they are not ones who will be reproached"
  70,31,"But whoever was looking beyond that, those, they are ones who turn away"
  70,32,"And those, they who in their trusts and to their compacts are ones who shepherd"
  70,33,"And those, they who, giving their testimony, are ones who uphold"
  70,34,"And those, they who over their formal prayers are watchful"
  70,35,"Those will be in Gardens, ones who are honored"
  70,36,"What is with those who were ungrateful—ones who run forward towards thee, eyes fixed in horror"
  70,37,"to the right and the left, tied in knots"
  70,38,Is not every man of them desirous of being caused to enter into a Garden of Bliss
  70,39,"No indeed. Truly, We created them out of what they know"
