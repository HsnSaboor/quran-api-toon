quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When the heaven will be split apart
  82,2,and when the stars will be scattered
  82,3,and when the seas will be caused to gush forth
  82,4,and when the graves will be scattered about
  82,5,every soul would know what it put forward and what it postponed
  82,6,O human being! What deluded thee as to thy generous Lord
  82,7,"He Who created thee, then, shaped thee in proportion"
  82,8,He composed thee in whichever form He willed
  82,9,No indeed! Nay! You deny this way of life
  82,10,"And, truly, there are ones who guard over you"
  82,11,ones who are generous scribes
  82,12,They know whatever you accomplish
  82,13,"Truly, the pious will be in bliss"
  82,14,"And, truly, the ones who act immorally will be in hellfire"
  82,15,They will roast on the Day of Judgment
  82,16,And they will not be of ones who are absent
  82,17,And what will cause thee to recognize what the Day of Judgment is
  82,18,"Again, what will cause thee to recognize what the Day of Judgment is"
  82,19,It is a Day whereon a soul will not possess anything to avail another soul and the command on that Day will belong to God
  83,1,Woe be to the ones who give short measure
  83,2,those who when they measure against humanity obtained full measure
  83,3,"Yet when they wanted to measure for them, or weigh for them, they skimp"
  83,4,Think those not that they will be ones who are raised up
  83,5,on the sublime Day
  83,6,a Day when humanity will stand up for the Lord of the worlds
