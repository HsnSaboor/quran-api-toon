quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  20,13,And I chose thee so listen to what is revealed
  20,14,"Truly, I—I am God. There is no god but Me. So worship Me and perform the formal prayer of My Remembrance"
  20,15,"Truly, the Hour is that which arrives. I am about to conceal it so that every soul is given recompense for what it endeavors"
  20,16,So let none bar thee from it—whoever believes not in it and followed his own desires—so that thee not survive
  20,17,And what is that in thy right hand O Moses
  20,18,"Moses said: This is my staff. I lean on it, and beat down leaves from a tree with it for my herd of sheep and for me in it are other uses"
  20,19,"He said: Cast it, O Moses"
  20,20,So he cast it. That is when it was a viper sliding
  20,21,"He said: Take it and fear not. We will cause it to return to its first state"
  20,22,And clasp thy hand to thy armpit. It will go forth shimmering white without any evil as another sign
  20,23,that We cause thee to see of Our greater signs
  20,24,"Go thou to Pharaoh! Truly, he was defiant"
  20,25,"Moses said: My Lord"
  20,26,Expand my breast for me and make Thou my affair easy for me
  20,27,and untie the knot from my tongue
  20,28,so they understand my saying
  20,29,and assign to me a minister from my people—
  20,30,"—Aaron, my brother"
  20,31,Strengthen my vigor with him
  20,32,and ascribe him as a partner in my affair
  20,33,that we glorify Thee much
  20,34,and we remember Thee frequently
  20,35,"Truly, Thou, Thou alone hadst been seeing of us"
  20,36,"He said: Surely, thou wert given thy petition, O Moses"
  20,37,"Certainly, We showed grace on thee another time"
