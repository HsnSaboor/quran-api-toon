quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  18,84,"Truly, We established him firmly on the earth and gave him a route to everything"
  18,85,So he pursued a route
  18,86,"until when he reached the setting of the sun. He found it beginning to set in a spring of muddy water. And he found near it a folk. We said: O Dhu-l Qarnayn! Either thou wilt punish them or thou wilt take them to thyself with goodness"
  18,87,"He said: As for him who did wrong, we will punish him. Again, he will be returned to his Lord Who will punish him with a horrible punishment"
  18,88,"But as for him who believed and did as one in accord with morality, he will have the fairer recompense. And we will say to him of our command with ease"
  18,89,"Again, he pursued a route"
  18,90,until when he reached the rising place of the sun. He found it coming up on a folk for whom We make not any obstruction against it
  18,91,"Thus, We, surely, enclosed whatever was near him through awareness"
  18,92,"Again, he pursued a route"
  18,93,until when he reached between two embankments. He found behind them a folk who would almost not understand any saying
  18,94,"They said: O Dhu-l Qarnayn! Truly, Gog and Magog are ones who make corruption in and on the earth. Will we assign to thee payment if thou hast made an embankment between us and between them"
  18,95,"He said: What my Lord established firmly for me is better, so assist me with strength. I will make a fortification between you and between them"
  18,96,"Give me ingots of iron, until when he made level between the two cliffs. He said: Blow, until when he made it a fire. He said: Give me molten brass to pour out over it"
  18,97,So they were not able to scale it nor were they able to dig through it
