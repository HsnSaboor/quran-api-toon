quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,they would not be availed by what they had been given of enjoyment
  26,208,We caused no town to perish but that it had ones who warn
  26,209,as a reminder. And We had not been ones who are unjust
  26,210,It came not forth by the satans
  26,211,and neither is it fit and proper for them nor are they able
  26,212,"Truly, they, from having the ability to hear, are the ones who are set aside"
  26,213,So call thou not to any god with God so that thou be among the ones who are punished
  26,214,"And warn thy nearest kin, the kinspeople"
  26,215,And make low thy wing to whoever followed thee among the ones who believe
  26,216,"Then, if they rebelled against thee, then, say: Truly, I am free of what you do"
  26,217,"And put thy trust in The Almighty, The Compassionate"
  26,218,Who sees thee at the time thou hast stood up
  26,219,and thy going to and fro of the ones who prostrate themselves
  26,220,"Truly, He is The Hearing, The Knowing"
  26,221,Will I tell you in whom the satans come forth
  26,222,They come forth in every sinful false one who gives listen
  26,223,but most of them are ones who lie
  26,224,"As for the poets, the ones who are in error follow them"
  26,225,Hast thou not considered that they wander in every valley
  26,226,and that they say what they accomplish not
  26,227,But those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality remembered God frequently and helped themselves after they were wronged. And those who did wrong will know by which overturning they will be turned about
