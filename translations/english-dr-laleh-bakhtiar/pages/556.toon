  64,2,"He it is Who created you: So some of you are ones who disbelieve and some of you are ones who believe. And God is Seeing of what you do"
  64,3,He created the heavens and the earth with The Truth and He formed you and formed your forms well. And to Him is the Homecoming
  64,4,He knows what is in the heavens and the earth and He knows what you keep secret and what you speak openly. And God is Knowing of what is in the breasts
  64,5,Approaches you not the tiding of those who were ungrateful before? They experienced the mischief of their affair and there is a painful punishment for them
  64,6,"That had been because their Messengers approach them with the clear portents, but they said: Will mortals guide us? So they were ungrateful and turned away. And God is Self-Sufficient. And God is Rich, Worthy of Praise"
  64,7,"Those who were ungrateful claimed that they will never be raised up. Say: Yea! By my Lord, you will, certainly, be raised up. Again, you will be told of what you did. And that is easy for God"
  64,8,"So believe in God and His Messenger, and in the Light which We caused to descend. And God is Aware of what you do"
  64,9,"On a Day when He will amass you for the Day of Gathering, that will be the day of the mutual loss and gain, and whoever believes in God and does as one in accord with morality, He will absolve him of his evil deeds and He will cause him to enter Gardens beneath which rivers run as ones who will dwell in them forever, eternally. That will be winning the sublime triumph"
