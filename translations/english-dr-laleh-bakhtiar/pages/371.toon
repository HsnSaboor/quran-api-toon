quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,And assign me a good name of good repute with the later ones
  26,85,and make me one who inherits the Garden of Bliss
  26,86,"And forgive my father. Truly, he had been among the ones who go astray"
  26,87,And cover me not with shame on a Day they will be raised up
  26,88,on a Day neither wealth will profit nor children
  26,89,but he who approached God with a pure-hearted heart
  26,90,And the Garden will be brought close for the ones who are Godfearing
  26,91,and hellfire will be advanced for the ones who are in error
  26,92,"And it will be said to them: Where is what you had been worshipping"
  26,93,instead of God? Are you helped by them? Or help they themselves
  26,94,"Then, they were thrown down into it, they and the ones who are in error"
  26,95,"and the army of Iblis, one and all"
  26,96,And they said while they are in it striving against one another
  26,97,"By God! Truly, we had been clearly wandering astray"
  26,98,when we made you equal with the Lord of the worlds
  26,99,And no one caused us to go astray but the ones who sin
  26,100,Now we have not ones who are intercessors
  26,101,"nor an ardent friend, a loyal friend"
  26,102,"Would that there were for us a return again. Then, we would be among the ones who believe"
  26,103,"Truly, in this is a sign; yet most of them had not been ones who believe"
  26,104,"And, truly, thy Lord, He is The Almighty, The Compassionate"
  26,105,The folk of Noah denied the ones who are sent
  26,106,"when their brother, Noah, said to them: Will you not be Godfearing"
  26,107,"Truly, I am a trustworthy Messenger to you"
  26,108,so be Godfearing of God and obey me
  26,109,And I ask you not for any compensation for it. My compensation is only from the Lord of the worlds
  26,110,So be Godfearing of God and obey you me
  26,111,"They said: Will we believe in thee when it is the most wretched that followed thee"
