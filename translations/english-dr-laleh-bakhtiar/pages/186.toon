  8,71,"But if they want treachery against thee, they, surely, betrayed God before, so He gave thee power over them. And God is Knowing, Wise"
  8,72,"Truly, those who believed and emigrated and struggled with their wealth and their lives in the way of God, and those who gave refuge and helped, those are protectors, some of some others. And those who believed, but emigrate not, you have no duty of friendship to them at all until they emigrate. And if they asked you for help in the way of life, then, it would be upon you to help them, but against the folk whom between you and between them there is a solemn promise. And God is Seeing of what you do"

  8,74,"And those who believed and emigrated and struggled in the way of God and those who gave refuge and helped, those, they are the ones who truthfully believe. For them is forgiveness and generous provision"
  8,75,"And those who believed afterwards, and emigrated and struggled beside you, then, those are of you. And those imbued through wombs, blood relations, some are more deserving than some others in what is prescribed by God, truly, God is Knowing of everything"
