quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,95,"It is God Who causes the seed-grain and the date-stone to split and sprout. He causes the living to issue from the dead, and He causes the dead to issue from the living. That is God, so how are you deluded from the truth"
  6,96,"He cleaves the daybreak. He makes the night for rest and tranquility, and the Sun and Moon for telling time. Such is His judgment and ordering, the Exalted in Power, the Knower of all things"
  6,97,"It is He Who has made the stars for you, that you may guide yourselves, with their help, through the dark spaces of land and sea. We detail Our signs for people who think"
  6,98,"It is He Who has produced you from a single soul, in a place of sojourn and a place of departure. We detail Our signs for people who understand"
  6,99,"It is He Who sends down rain from the skies. With it, We produce vegetation of all kinds. From some We produce green crops, out of which We produce grain heaped up. Out of the date palm and its sheaths, come clusters of dates hanging low and near, and gardens of grapes, and olives, and pomegranates, each similar yet different. When they begin to bear fruit, look at the fruit and the ripeness of it. Behold, in these are signs for people who believe"
  6,100,"Yet they make the jinn equal with God, though God did create the jinn. And they falsely, having no knowledge, attribute to Him sons and daughters. Praise and glory be to Him, for He is above what they attribute to Him"
  6,101,"He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have a son without a female companion? He created all things, and He has full knowledge of all things"
