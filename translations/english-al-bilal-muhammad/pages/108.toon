quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,6,"O you who believe, when you prepare for prayer, wash your faces, hands and arms to the elbows, wipe your heads and feet to the ankles. If you are in a state of ceremonial impurity, bathe your whole body. But if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes from the offices of nature, or you have been intimate with women, and you find no water, then take for yourselves natural earth, and wash your faces and hands with it. God does not wish to make things difficult, but to refine you, and to complete his favor to you, that you may experience appreciation"
  5,7,"And call to mind the favor of God to you, and His covenant which He ratified with you when you said, “We hear, and we follow.” And be conscious of God, for God knows well the secrets of your hearts"
  5,8,"O you who believe, stand out firmly for God, as witnesses to fair dealings. And do not let the hatred of others towards you make you stray to wrong and depart from justice. Be just, that is next to piety, and be conscious of God, for God is well acquainted with all that you do"
  5,9,"To those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, God has promised forgiveness and a great reward"
