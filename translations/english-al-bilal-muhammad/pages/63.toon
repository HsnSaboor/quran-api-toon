  3,103,"And hold tightly, all together, by the rope that God stretches out to you, and do not be divided among yourselves. And remember with gratitude God's favor on you, because you were enemies and He joined your hearts in friendship, so that by His grace, you became connected. And you were on the brink of the pit of fire and He saved you from it. God makes His signs clear to you, that you may be guided"

  3,108,"These are the signs of God. We rehearse them to you in truth, and God wills no injustice to any of His creatures"
