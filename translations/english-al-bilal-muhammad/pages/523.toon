quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  51,52,"Similarly, no messenger came to the peoples before them, except that they said of him in like manner, “A deceiver, or one possessed.”"
  51,53,"Is this the legacy they have transmitted one to another? No, they are a people transgressing beyond bounds"
  51,54,So turn away from them. There will be no blame on you
  51,55,"But teach, for teaching benefits the believers"
  51,56,I only created jinn and humans so that they may worship Me
  51,57,"No sustenance do I require of them, nor do I require that they feed Me"
  51,58,"For God is He Who gives all sustenance. He is Lord, powerful, and steadfast forever"
  51,59,"For the wrongdoers, their portion is like the portion of their people of earlier generations. So do not let them ask Me to hasten that portion"
  51,60,Woe then to the unbelievers on account of their day. The day promised to them
  52,1,By the mountain
  52,2,By a decree inscribed
  52,3,In parchment unfolded
  52,4,By the much-frequented house
  52,5,By the canopy raised high
  52,6,And by the ocean that is filled
  52,7,Indeed the doom from your Lord will indeed come to pass
  52,8,There are none who can avert it
  52,9,On the day that the firmament will be in dreadful commotion
  52,10,And the mountains will fly near and far
  52,11,Then woe that day to those who treat truth as falsehood
  52,12,That play in shallow things
  52,13,"That day they will be thrust down to the fire of hell, irresistibly"
  52,14,"“This,” it will be said, “Is the fire that you used to deny"
