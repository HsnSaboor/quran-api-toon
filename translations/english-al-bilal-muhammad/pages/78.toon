quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,7,"From what is left by parents and those nearest related, there is a share for men and a share for women, whether the property be small or large, a determined share"
  4,8,"But if at the time of division there are other relatives, or orphans, or other people in need present, then provide for them out of the property, and speak to them words of kindness and justice"
  4,9,"Let those disposing of an estate have the same considerations in mind as they would if they had left their own dependents behind. Let them also consider God, and speak words that are appropriate"
  4,10,"Those who unjustly take the property of orphans, also take a fire into their own bodies. They will soon be enduring a blazing fire"
  4,11,"God directs you regarding your children’s inheritance. To the male, a portion equal to that of two females. If only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance. If only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of the inheritance to each, if the deceased left children. If no children and the parents are the only heirs, the mother has a third. If the deceased left brothers or sisters, the mother has a sixth. These distributions, in all cases, are after the payment of estate tax and debt. You do not know whether your parents or your children are nearer to you in benefit. These are settled portions ordained by God, and God is All Knowing, All Wise"
