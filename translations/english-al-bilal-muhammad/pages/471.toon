  40,34,"“And to you, there came Joseph in times gone by, with clear signs, but you did not cease to doubt the mission for which he had come. Then when he died you said, ‘No messenger will God send after him.’ So God leaves to stray those who transgress and live in doubt"
  40,35,"“Those who dispute about the signs of God, without any authority that has reached them, terrible is such conduct in the sight of God and the believers. So God seals up every heart of arrogant and obstinate transgressors.”"
