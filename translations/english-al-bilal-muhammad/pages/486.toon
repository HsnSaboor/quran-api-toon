quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  42,23,"That is the bounty by which God gives hope to His servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say, “No reward do I ask of you for this, except the love of close family.” And if anyone earns any good, We will give him an increase of good in respect of it, for God is Oft-Forgiving, most ready to appreciate service"
  42,24,"What, do they say, “He has fabricated a lie against God?” But if God willed, He could seal up your heart, and God blots out vanity, and proves the truth by His words, for He knows well the secrets of all hearts"
  42,25,"He is the One Who accepts repentance from His servants and forgives sins, and He knows all that you do"
  42,26,"And He listens to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, and gives them increase from His bounty, but for the unbelievers, theirs is a terrible penalty"
  42,27,"If God were to enlarge provisions for His servants, they would indeed transgress beyond all bounds through the earth, but he sends it down in due measure as He pleases, for He is with His servants, and is Well-Acquainted, and Watchful"
  42,28,"He is the One Who sends down rain after people have given up hope, and scatters His mercy, and He is the Protector, Worthy of All Praise"
  42,29,"And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the living creatures that He has scattered through them, and He has power to gather them together when He wills"
  42,30,"Whatever misfortune happens to you is because of the things your hands have done, and for many of them He grants forgiveness"
  42,31,"Nor can you stop His will in the earth, nor do you have besides God, anyone to protect or to help"
