quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  42,32,And among His signs are the ships running smoothly through the ocean as mountains
  42,33,"If it were His will, He could stop the wind. Then they would become motionless on the face of the ocean. Indeed in this are signs for all who patiently persevere and are grateful"
  42,34,"Or He can cause them to perish because of the harm that they have earned, but much does He forgive"
  42,35,"But let those know who dispute about Our signs, that there is for them no way of escape"
  42,36,"Whatever you are given here is only a temporary enjoyment of this life, but that which is with God is better and longer lasting. It is for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord"
  42,37,"Those who avoid great sins and shameful deeds, and when they are angry, even then they forgive"
  42,38,"Those who listen to their Lord, and establish prayer, who conducts their affairs by consultation, who gives out of what We bestow on them for sustenance"
  42,39,"And those who when oppression is inflicted on them, defend themselves"
  42,40,"The reward for an injury is an injury equal to it, but if a person forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from God, for God does not love those who do wrong"
  42,41,"But indeed, if any help and defend themselves after a wrong is done to them, on them there is no cause for blame"
  42,42,"The blame is only against those who oppress people, do wrong, and transgress beyond bounds through the land, defying right. For them there will be a terrible penalty"
  42,43,"But indeed if any show patience and forgiveness, that would truly be a courageous resolution to their affairs"
  42,44,"For any whom God leaves astray, there is no protector after that, and you will see the wrongdoers when in sight of the penalty say, “Is there any way to return?”"
