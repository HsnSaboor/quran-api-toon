quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  7,179,"Many are the jinn and humans We have made for hell. They have hearts with which they feel not, eyes with which they see not, and ears with which they hear not. They are like cows, no, more apathetic, and they are heedless"
  7,180,"The most beautiful names belong to God, so call on Him by them, and caution people who use profanity in His names, and that for what they do, they will soon be rewarded"
  7,181,"Of those We have created, are those who direct with truth and dispense justice"
  7,182,"Those who reject Our signs, We will gradually visit with punishment, in ways they cannot imagine"
  7,183,"Respite will I grant to them, for My plan is strong and unfailing"
  7,184,"Do they not reflect? Their companion is not seized with madness, he is only a clear warner"
  7,185,"Do they see nothing in the systems of the heavens and the earth, and all that God has created? Do they not see that it may well be that their term is near and ending? In what message after this will they then believe"
  7,186,"Those who God rejects from His guidance, there can be no guide. He will leave them in their trespasses, wandering in distraction"
  7,187,"They ask you about the Hour, when will be its appointed time? Say, “The knowledge of it is with my Lord. None but He can reveal as to when it will occur. Heavy will be its burden through the heavens and the earth. All of a sudden it will come to you.” They ask you as if you were eager in search of it. Say, “The knowledge of it is with God.\" But most understand not"
