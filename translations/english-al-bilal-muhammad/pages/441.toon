quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  36,13,"Give them by way of a parable the story of the companions of the city. Behold, there came messengers to it"
  36,14,"When We sent to them two messengers they rejected them, so We reinforced them with a third. They said, “Truly we have been sent on a mission to you.”"
  36,15,"They said, “You are only human like us, and God, the Merciful Benefactor, sends no sort of revelation. You do nothing but lie.”"
  36,16,"They said, “Our Lord knows that we have been sent on a mission to you"
  36,17,“And our duty is only to proclaim the message clearly.”
  36,18,"They said, “For us, we predict an evil omen from you. If you desist not, we will certainly stone you, indeed a terrible punishment will be inflicted on you by us.”"
  36,19,"They said, “Your evil omens are with you. Are you not then advised? No, but you are a people transgressing all bounds.”"
  36,20,"Then there came running from the farthest part of the city, a person announcing, “O my people, follow the messengers"
  36,21,"“Follow those who ask no reward of you, and who have themselves received guidance. 21 (End of Part)"
  36,22,"“And what would happen to me if I did not serve Him Who created me, and He to Whom you will all be brought back"
  36,23,"“Shall I take gods besides Him? If God, the Merciful Benefactor, should intend some adversity for me, of no use would be their intercession for me, nor can they save me"
  36,24,"“I would indeed, if I were to do so, be in manifest error"
  36,25,"“For me, I have faith in the Guardian Evolver of you all, so listen to me.”"
  36,26,"It was said, “Enter the garden.” He said, “I wish that my people knew"
  36,27,"“That my Lord has granted me forgiveness, and has enrolled me among those held in honor.”"
