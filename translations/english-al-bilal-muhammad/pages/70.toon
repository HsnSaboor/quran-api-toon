quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  3,154,"After the distress, He sent down calm on a company of you overcome with slumber, while another company was stirred to anxiety by their feelings, moved by wrongful doubt of God, suspicions due to ignorance. They said, “What concern is this of ours?” Say, “Indeed, this concern is entirely God's.” They hide in their minds what they dare not reveal to you. They say, “If we had anything to do with this affair, we would not have been in the slaughter here.” Say, “Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death.” But all this was for God to make evident what is in your chest and to redeem what is in your hearts, for God knows well the secrets of your hearts"
  3,155,"Those of you who turned back on the day the two armies met, Satan caused them to fail, because of some wrong they did, but God has deleted their faults, for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Understanding"
  3,156,"O you who believe, do not be like the unbelievers who say of their brothers, when they are traveling through the earth or engaged in fighting, “If they had stayed with us, they would not have died, or been slain.” This is so that God may make it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts. And God gives life and death, and God sees well all that you do"
  3,157,"And if you are slain or die in the way of God, forgiveness and mercy from God are far better than all they could accumulate"
