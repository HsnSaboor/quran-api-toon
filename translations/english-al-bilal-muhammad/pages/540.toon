quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  57,19,"And those who believe in God and His messengers, they are the sincere and the witnesses, in the eyes of their Lord. They will have their reward and their light. But those who reject God and deny Our signs, they are the companions of hellfire"
  57,20,"Know that the life of the present is but play and entertainment, pomp and boasting, and increasing for yourselves, wealth and children. Here is a similitude, the rain and the growth which it brings forth pleases the hearts of those who plant it, soon it withers, and you will see it grow yellow, then it becomes dry and crumbles away, but in the hereafter is a penalty severe, and forgiveness from God and His grace, and what is the life of the present but stuff of illusion"
  57,21,"And for those of you foremost, is forgiveness from your Lord, and a garden the width of heaven and earth, prepared for those who believe in God and His messengers. That is the grace of God which He bestows on whom He pleases, and God is the Lord of grace abounding"
  57,22,"No misfortune can happen on earth or in yourselves, except that it is recorded in a decree before We bring it into existence. That is truly easy for God"
  57,23,"In order that you may not despair over opportunities that missed you, nor exult over favors bestowed upon you, for God does not love any vain boaster"
  57,24,"Such people are greedy, and recommend greed to others. And if any turn back, indeed God is free of all needs, worthy of all praise"
