quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  48,16,"Say to the desert Arabs who lagged behind, “You will be summoned to fight against a people who possess great military might. You will fight, or they will submit. Then if you show obedience, God will grant you an excellent reward, but if you turn back as you did before, He will punish you with a terrible penalty.”"
  48,17,"No blame is there on the blind, nor is there blame on those with other disabilities, nor on one who is ill, if they do not join the war. But those who follow God and his messenger, God will admit him to gardens with rivers flowing through them, and he who turns back, God will punish him with a terrible penalty"
  48,18,"God's grace was on the believers when they pledged allegiance to you under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down tranquility to them, and He rewarded them with a speedy victory"
  48,19,"And many gains will they acquire, and God is Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom"
  48,20,"God has promised that you will acquire many gains, much that He has given you beforehand, and He has restrained the hands of human beings from you, that it may be a sign for the believers, and that He may guide you to a straight path"
  48,21,"And other gains that were not within your power, but which God has comprehended, and God has power over all things"
  48,22,"If the unbelievers fought you, they would certainly turn their backs, and then they would find neither protector nor helper"
  48,23,"Such was the Sunnah of God in the past, and no change will you find in the Sunnah of God"
