  5,114,"Said Jesus the son of Mary, “O God, our Guardian Evolver, send us from heaven a table set, that there may be for us, for the first and the last of us, a solemn celebration and a sign from You, and provide for our sustenance, for you are the Best Sustainer.”"
  5,115,"God said, “I will send it down to you, but if any of you after that resists faith, I will punish him with a penalty such as I have not inflicted on anyone among all peoples.”"
  5,116,"And behold, God will say, “O Jesus the son of Mary, did you say to the people, worship me and my mother as gods?” He will say, “Glory to You, never could I say what I had no right to say.

  5,117,"“Never did I say to them anything except what You asked me to say, namely, ‘worship God, my Lord and your Lord’, and I was a witness over them while I lived among them. When You raised me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a witness to all things"
