  16,80,"It is God Who made your houses homes of rest and quiet for you, and made for you, out of the skin of animals, dwellings which you find light on the day you travel and the day of encampment, and out of their wool, and their soft-fibers, and their hair, comforts and articles of convenience for a time"
  16,81,"It is God Who made out of the things He created, things to give you shade, of the hills He made some for your shelter, He made you garments to protect you from heat, and armor to protect you from violence. Thus, He completes His favors on you that you may bow to His will"
  16,82,"But if they turn away, your duty is only to proclaim the clear message"
  16,83,"They recognize the favors of God. Then they ignore them, and most of them are ungrateful"
  16,84,"One day We will raise from all peoples a witness. Then will no excuse be accepted from unbelievers, nor will they receive any favors"
  16,85,"When the wrongdoers see the penalty, there will neither be a way to mitigate, nor will they receive respite"
  16,86,"When those who gave partners to God see their partners they will say, “Our Lord, these are our partners, those whom we used to invoke besides You.” But they will throw back their word at them and say, “Indeed you are liars.”"
  16,87,"That day will they show submission to God, and all their creations will leave them"
