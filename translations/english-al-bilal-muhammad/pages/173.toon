quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,171,"When We shook the Mount over them, as if it had been a canopy, and they thought it was going to fall on them We said, “Hold firmly to what We have given you, and bring to remembrance what is in there, so perhaps you may be conscious.”"
  7,172,"When your Lord brought out from the children of Adam, from their loins, their descendants, and made them testify concerning themselves saying, “Am I not your Lord?” They said, “Yes, we do testify.” Lest you should say on the Day of Accountability, “Of this we were never mindful.”"
  7,173,"Or lest you should say, “Our parents before us may have taken false gods, but we are their descendants. Will You then destroy us because of the deeds of people who were irresponsible?”"
  7,174,We explain the signs in detail that perhaps they may repent
  7,175,"Relate to them the story of the person to whom We sent Our signs, but he passed them by, so Satan followed him up, and he went astray"
  7,176,"If it had been Our will, We would have elevated him with Our signs, but he inclined to the earth, and followed his own vain desires. His similitude is that of a dog. If you pet it, it lolls out its tongue, or if you ignore it, it still lolls out its tongue. That is the similitude of those who reject Our signs. So relate the story, perhaps they may reflect"
  7,177,Terrible for a similitude are the people who reject Our signs and wrong their own souls
  7,178,"Whom God guides, he is on the right path. Whom He rejects from His guidance, such people will perish"
