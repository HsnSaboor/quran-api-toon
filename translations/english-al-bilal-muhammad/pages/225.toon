  11,30,"“And O my people, who would help me against God if I drove them away? Will you not then take heed"
  11,31,"“I do not tell you that with me are the treasures of God, nor do I know what is hidden, nor do I claim to be an angel, nor do I say of those whom your eyes despise that God will not grant them all that is good. God knows best what is in their souls. I would, if I did, indeed be a wrongdoer.”"
