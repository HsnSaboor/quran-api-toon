quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  47,12,"Indeed God will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens with rivers flowing through them, while those who reject God will enjoy themselves and eat as livestock eat, but the fire will be their abode"
  47,13,"And how many cities, with more power than your city which has driven you out, have We caused to perish? And there was none to aid them"
  47,14,"Then is one who is clearly on a path from his Lord, no better than one to whom the harmfulness of his conduct seems pleasing, and those who follow their own lusts"
  47,15,"Here is a parable of the garden which the righteous are promised. In it are rivers of water incorruptible, rivers of milk of which the taste never changes, rivers of wine, a joy to those who drink, and rivers of honey, pure and clear. In it there are all kinds of fruits for them, and grace from their Lord. Can those in such bliss be compared to those who will dwell forever in the fire, and who will be given boiling water to drink, so that it cuts up their insides"
  47,16,"And among them are people who listen to you, but in the end, after they leave from you, they say to those who have received knowledge, “What is it he said just then?” These are people whose hearts God has sealed, and who follow their own lusts"
  47,17,"But to those who receive guidance, He increases the guidance, and bestows on them piety and restraint"
  47,18,"Do they then only wait for the Hour, that it should come on them all of a sudden? But some signs of it have already come, and when it is on them, how then can they benefit by the advice"
  47,19,"Therefore know that there is no god but God, and ask forgiveness for your faults, and for the men and women who believe. For God knows how you move about and how you dwell in your homes"
