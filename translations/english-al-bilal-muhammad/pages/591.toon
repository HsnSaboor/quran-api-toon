quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the galaxy and the night visitant
  86,2,And what will explain to you what the night-visitant is
  86,3,It is the star of piercing brightness
  86,4,There is no soul that does not have a protector over it
  86,5,Now let the human being think about from what he is created
  86,6,He is created from a drop emitted
  86,7,Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs
  86,8,Surely God is able to bring him back
  86,9,The day that all things secret will be tested
  86,10,They will have no power and no helper
  86,11,By the firmament which returns
  86,12,And by the earth which cracks open
  86,13,Behold this is the word that is decisive
  86,14,It is not a thing for entertainment
  86,15,"As for them, they are plotting a scheme"
  86,16,But I am devising a plan
  86,17,Therefore grant respite to the unbelievers. Give respite to them for a while
  87,1,Glory to the name of your Lord Most High
  87,2,"Who has created, and further gives order and proportion"
  87,3,"Who has ordained laws, and granted guidance"
  87,4,And Who makes the pasture grow
  87,5,And then makes it dark stubble
  87,6,"By degrees We will teach you to declare the message, so you will not forget"
  87,7,"Except what God wills, for He knows what is manifest and what is hidden"
  87,8,And We will ease you to what is easy
  87,9,"Therefore give advice, in case the advice profits"
  87,10,The advice will be received by those who are conscious of God
  87,11,But it will be avoided by the most unfortunate ones
  87,12,Who will enter the great fire
  87,13,In which they will then neither die nor live
  87,14,But those will flourish who refine themselves
  87,15,And glorify the name of their Lord in prayer
