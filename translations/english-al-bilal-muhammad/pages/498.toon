  44,40,Indeed the day of sorting out is the time appointed for all of them
  44,41,"The day no protector can avail his client in anything, and no help can they receive"
  44,42,"Except those who receive God's mercy, for He is Exalted in Might, the Merciful Redeemer"
  44,43,Indeed the tree of Zaqqum—
  44,44,Will be the food of the sinful
  44,45,"Like molten brass, it will boil in their insides"
  44,46,Like the boiling of scalding water
  44,47,“Seize him and drag him into the middle of the blazing fire
  44,48,“Then pour over his head the penalty of boiling water

  44,55,There they can call for every kind of fruit in peace and security
  44,56,"Nor will they taste death there, only the first death, and He will preserve them from the penalty of the blazing fire"
