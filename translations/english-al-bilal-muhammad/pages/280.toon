quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,111,"One day every soul will come up struggling for itself, every soul will be rewarded for all of its actions, and none will be dealt with unjustly"
  16,112,"God sets forth a parable, a city enjoying security and quiet, abundantly supplied with sustenance from every place. Yet it was ungrateful for the favors of God, so God made it taste the garb of hunger and fear, because of the wrong they did"
  16,113,"And there came to them a messenger from among themselves, but they rejected him, so the punishment seized them in the middle of their wrongdoings"
  16,114,"So eat of the sustenance which God has provided for you, permissible and good, and be grateful for the favors of God, if it is He Whom you serve"
  16,115,"He has only forbidden you animals found dead, blood, the flesh of swine, and that over which a name other than God has been invoked, but if one is forced by necessity, with neither outright rejection, nor transgressing due limits, then God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming"
  16,116,"But do not say, for it would be a lie that you would have your tongues assert, “This is permissible, and this is forbidden,” So as to ascribe false things to God. For those who ascribe false things to God, will never prosper"
  16,117,"They would get a little profit, but a most terrible penalty"
  16,118,"To the Jews We prohibited such things as We have mentioned to you before, We did them no harm, but they did harm to themselves"
