  54,11,"So We opened the gates of heaven, with water pouring out"
  54,12,"And We caused the earth to gush forth with springs, so the waters met and rose to the extent decreed"
  54,13,But We bore him on an ark made of broad planks and caulked with palm-fiber
  54,14,It floats under our eyes. A reward for one who had been rejected
  54,15,And We have left it as a sign. Then is there any who will receive advice
  54,16,But how was My penalty and My warning
  54,17,And We have indeed made the Quran intuitive. Then are there any who will receive advice
