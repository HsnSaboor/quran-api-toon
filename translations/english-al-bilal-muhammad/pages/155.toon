quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,38,"He will say, “Join the company of the peoples who passed away before you, enter into the fire, humans and jinn.” Every time a new people enter, it curses its sister people, until they follow each other, all into the fire. Says the last about the first, “Our Lord, these are the ones who misled us, so give them a double punishment in the fire.” He will say, “Doubled for all.” But this you do not understand"
  7,39,"Then the first will say to the last, “See, you have no advantage over us, so taste the penalty for all that you did.”"
  7,40,"To those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance, no opening will there be of the gates of heaven, nor will they enter the garden, until the camel can pass through the eye of the needle. Such is Our reward for those in sin"
  7,41,"For them there is hell, as a bed, and folds and folds of covering above. Such is Our punishment for those who do wrong"
  7,42,"So believe and work righteousness, for no burden do We place on any soul, except that which she can bear. They will be companions of the garden, to dwell therein forever"
  7,43,"And We will remove from their hearts, any hatred. Beneath them will be rivers flowing and they will say, “Praise God, who has guided us to this. Never would we have found guidance, had it not been for the guidance of God, indeed it was the truth that the messengers of our Lord brought to us.” And they will hear the call, “Behold, the garden before you. You have been made its inheritors, because of your deeds.”"
