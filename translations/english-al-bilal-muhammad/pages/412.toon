quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  31,12,"We bestowed in the past, this wisdom on Luqman, “Show your gratitude to God.” Any who is grateful, does so to the profit of his own soul, but if any is ungrateful, indeed God is free of all wants, worthy of all praise"
  31,13,"Behold, Luqman said to his son by way of instruction, “O my son, do not join in worship others with God, for false worship is indeed the highest wrongdoing.”"
  31,14,"And We have instructed man to be good to his parents. With hardship upon hardship did his mother bear him, and two years was his weaning. Hear the command, “Show gratitude to Me and to your parents, and to Me is your final goal"
  31,15,"“But if they strive to make you join in worship with Me, things of which you do not know, follow them not, yet accompany them in this life with justice and consideration, and follow the way of those who turn to me in love. In the end, the return of you all is to Me, and I will tell you the truth and meaning of all that you did.”"
  31,16,"“O my son,” said Luqman, “If there were the weight of a mustard-seed, and it were hidden in a rock, or anywhere in the heavens or on earth, God will bring it out, for God understands the greatest mysteries, and is well acquainted with them"
  31,17,"“O my son, establish prayer, encourage what is just, and discourage what is wrong, and bear with patient constancy whatever may happen to you, for this is firmness of purpose in the conduct of affairs"
  31,18,"“And do not turn your cheek to people, nor walk in insolence through the earth, for God loves not any arrogant boaster"
  31,19,"“And be moderate in your pace, and lower your voice, for the harshest of sounds without doubt is the braying of the donkey.”"
