  40,26,"Pharaoh said, “Leave me to slay Moses, and let him call on his Lord. What I fear is that he should change your way of life, or that he will cause problems to appear in the land.”"
  40,27,"Moses said, “I have indeed called upon my Lord and your Lord for protection from every arrogant one who does not believe in the Day of Account.”"
  40,28,"A believing person from among the people of Pharaoh, who had concealed his faith said, “Will you slay a person because he says, ‘My Lord is God?’ When he has indeed come to you with guidance from your Lord?

  40,31,"“Something like the fate of the people of Noah, the ‘Ad, and the Thamud, and those who came after them, but God never wishes injustice on His servants"
  40,32,"“And O my people, I fear for you, the Day of Calling"
  40,33,"“A day when you will turn your backs and flee. No defender will you have against God. Any whom God leaves to stray, there is none to guide"
