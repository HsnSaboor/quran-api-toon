  7,140,"He said, “Should I seek for you a god other than God, when it is God Who has endowed you with gifts above the nations?”"
  7,141,"And remember We rescued you from Pharaoh’s people, who afflicted you with the worst of penalties, who slew your sons and kept alive your females. In that was a momentous trial from your Lord"
  7,142,"We appointed for Moses thirty nights, and completed the period with ten more. So was completed the term with his Lord, forty nights, and Moses had charged his brother Aaron, “Represent me among my people, do right, and do not follow the way of those who do wrong.”"
  7,143,"When Moses came to the place appointed by Us, and his Guardian Evolver addressed him, then he said, “O my Lord, show Yourself to me that I may look upon you.” God said, “By no means can you see Me, but look upon the mountain, if it remains in its place, then will you see Me.” When his Lord manifested His glory on the mountain, He made it as particles, and Moses fainted. When he returned to consciousness he said, “Glory be to You, to You do I turn, and I am the first to believe.”"
