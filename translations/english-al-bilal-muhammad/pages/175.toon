quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"Say, “I have no power over any good or harm to myself except as God wills. If I had knowledge of the unknown, I would have multiplied all good, and no harm would have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of good news to those who have faith.”"
  7,189,"It is He Who created you from a single person, and made her mate of like nature, in order that he might dwell with her in love. When they are united, she bears a light burden and carries it about. When she grows heavy, they both pray to God their Lord saying, “If You give us an excellent child, we promise to be grateful.”"
  7,190,"But when He gives them an excellent child, they ascribe to others a share in the gift they have received, but God is exalted high above the partners they ascribe to Him"
  7,191,"Do they indeed ascribe to Him as partners, things that can create nothing but are themselves created"
  7,192,"No aid can they give them, nor can they aid themselves"
  7,193,"If you call them to guidance, they will not follow. For you it is the same whether you call them or you hold your peace"
  7,194,"Indeed, those whom you call upon besides God are servants like you. Call upon them and let them respond to your prayer, if you are truthful"
  7,195,"Have they feet with which to walk? Or hands with which to touch? Or eyes with which to see? Or ears with which to hear? Say, “Call your ‘god-partners’, scheme against me, and give me no respite"
