quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"Those who believe say, “Why is a Surah not sent down for us?” But when a precise Surah is revealed, and fighting is mentioned in it, you will see those in whose hearts is a disease, looking at you with a look of one about to faint at the prospect of death, but more fitting for them–"
  47,21,"Would be to follow and say what is just, and when a matter is settled, it was best for them if they were true to God"
  47,22,"Then is it to be expected of you, that if you were put in authority, that you will commit crimes in the land, and break your ties with friends and family"
  47,23,"These are people who God has cursed, for He has made them deaf, and blinded their sight"
  47,24,"Do they then not earnestly seek to understand the Quran, or are their hearts locked up by it"
  47,25,"Those who turn back as traitors, after guidance was clearly shown to them, Satan has enticed them with false hopes"
  47,26,"This is because they said to those who hate what God has revealed, “We will follow you in part of this matter,” but God knows their secrets"
  47,27,"But how will it be when the angels take their souls at death, and strike their faces and their backs"
  47,28,"This is because they followed that which deserved the punishment of God, and they hated God's blessings, so He made their deeds of no effect"
  47,29,Or do those in whose hearts is a disease think that God will not bring to light all their hatred
