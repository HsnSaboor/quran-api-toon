quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the fig and the olive
  95,2,And Mount Sinai
  95,3,And this city of security
  95,4,We have indeed created the human being in the best of forms
  95,5,Then We debase them to the lowest of the low
  95,6,"Except those who believe and do righteous deeds, for they will have a reward unfailing"
  95,7,"Then what can, after this, deceive you about the judgment"
  95,8,Is not God the Wisest of Judges
  96,1,"Read, in the name of your Lord who created"
  96,2,Created the human being from a zygote
  96,3,"Proclaim, and your Lord is Most Bountiful"
  96,4,He Who taught the use of the pen
  96,5,Taught the human being that which he knew not
  96,6,"No, but the human being transgresses all bounds"
  96,7,When he looks upon himself as self-sufficient
  96,8,"Indeed, to your Lord is the return"
  96,9,Do you see one who forbids
  96,10,A worshipper when he turns to pray
  96,11,Have you seen whether he has guidance
  96,12,Or encourages righteousness
  96,13,Do you see if he denies and turns away
  96,14,Does he not know that God sees
  96,15,"Let him beware, that if he does not desist, We will drag him by the hair of his head"
  96,16,"His lying, sinful head"
  96,17,Then let him call to his advisers
  96,18,We will call on the angels of punishment
  96,19,"No, do not follow, but bow down in adoration, and bring yourself ever closer"
