quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,"No, but you love the fleeting life"
  75,21,And forget the hereafter
  75,22,Some faces that day will beam
  75,23,Looking towards their Lord
  75,24,And some faces that day will be sad and dismal
  75,25,In the thought that some backbreaking calamity was about to be inflicted on them
  75,26,"Yes, when it reaches to the collarbone"
  75,27,"And there will be a cry, “Is this an illusion?”"
  75,28,And he will conclude that it was the time of parting
  75,29,And one leg will be joined with another
  75,30,That day all will strive to your Lord
  75,31,"So he gave nothing in charity, nor did he pray"
  75,32,Instead he rejected truth and turned away
  75,33,Then he went to his family conceited
  75,34,"Woe to you, yes woe"
  75,35,"Again, woe to you, yes, woe"
  75,36,Does the human being think that he will be left uncontrollable
  75,37,Were they not a zygote from sperm emitted
  75,38,"Then did they become a leech-like fetus, then God made and fashion them in due proportion"
  75,39,"And of them He made two genders, male and female"
  75,40,Then does He not have the power to give life to the dead
  76,1,Has there ever been a period of time when the human being was not something to consider
  76,2,"Indeed We created the human being from a zygote. In order to try them, We then gave him hearing and sight"
  76,3,"We showed him the way, but whether they are grateful or ungrateful rests on their will"
  76,4,For the rejecters we have prepared chains and a blazing fire
  76,5,"As for the righteous, they will drink from a cup mixed with kafur"
