  2,271,"If you disclose your charity, that is fine. But if you give anonymously to those in need, that is best for you. It will remove from you some of your guilt, and God is well acquainted with what you do"

And whatever good you give, be assured God knows it well"
  2,274,"Those who give of their resources by night and by day, in secret and in public, have their reward with their Lord. On them will be no fear nor shall they grieve"
