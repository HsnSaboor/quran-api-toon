quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  29,46,"And do not dispute with the people of the Book, except with what is best, unless it is with those of them who inflict wrong. Instead say, “We believe in the revelation which has come down to us, and in that which came down to you. Our God and your God is one, and it is to Him we bow.”"
  29,47,"And We have sent down the Book to you. And those we gave the Book believe in it, as do some of these, and none but unbelievers reject our signs"
  29,48,"And you were not able to recite a book before this, nor are you able to transcribe it with your right hand. In that case indeed, they would have doubted"
  29,49,"No, here are signs self-evident in the hearts of those endowed with knowledge, and none but the unjust reject Our signs"
  29,50,"And they say, “Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, “The signs are indeed with God, and I am indeed a clear warner.”"
  29,51,"And is it not enough for them that we have sent down to you the Book that is rehearsed to them? Indeed, in it is a mercy and a reminder to those who believe"
  29,52,"Say, “Enough is God for a witness between you and me. He knows what is in the heavens and on earth, and it is those who believe in vanities and reject God who will perish"
