quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,14,"Fight them, and God will punish them by your hands, cover them with shame, help you to victory over them, heal the chest of believers"
  9,15,"And remove anger from their hearts, for God will turn to whom He wills, and God is All Knowing, All Wise"
  9,16,"Or do you think that you will be abandoned, as though God did not know those among you who strive? And take none for friends and protectors except God, His messenger, and the believers? But God is well acquainted with all that you do"
  9,17,"It is not for those who join gods with God to visit or maintain the places of worship of God, while witnessing against their own selves to unbelief. The works of such people bear no fruit, and they will dwell in fire"
  9,18,"The place of worship of God will be visited and maintained by those who believe in God and the Last Day, establish prayer, give zakat, and who fear none except God. They should expect to be on true guidance"
  9,19,"Do you make the giving of drink to pilgrims, or the maintenance of the Sacred Masjid, equal to the deeds of those who believe in God and the Last Day, and strive in the cause of God? They are not comparable in the sight of God, and God does not guide those who do wrong"
  9,20,"Those who believe, suffer exile, and strive in God's cause with their goods and their persons, have the highest rank in the sight of God. They are the people who will achieve salvation"
