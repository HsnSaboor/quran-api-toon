  55,69,Then which of the favors of your Lord will you deny
  55,70,"In them will be those good, and beautiful"
  55,71,Then which of the favors of your Lord will you deny
  55,72,"Companions subtle, in pavilions"
  55,73,Then which of the favors of your Lord will you deny
  55,74,Whom no human or jinn has touched before them
  55,75,Then which of the favors of your Lord will you deny
  55,76,Reclining on green cushions and rich carpets of beauty
  55,77,Then which of the favors of your Lord will you deny
  55,78,"Blessed is the name of your Lord, Full of Majesty, Bounty, and Honor"
  56,1,When the inevitable event comes to pass

  56,4,When the earth will be shaken to its depths
  56,5,And the mountains will be crumbled to atoms
  56,6,Becoming dust scattered abroad
  56,7,And you will be sorted out into three classes
  56,8,"The companions of the right, what are the companions of the right"
  56,9,"And the companions of the left, what are the companions of the left"
  56,10,"And those foremost, will be foremost"

  56,12,In gardens of bliss
  56,13,A number of people from those of the past
  56,14,And a few from those of later times
  56,15,On thrones encrusted
  56,16,"Reclining on them, facing each other"
