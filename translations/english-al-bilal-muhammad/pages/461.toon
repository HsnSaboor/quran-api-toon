quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,"Is one whose heart God has opened to Al-Islam, so that he has received enlightenment from God, no better than one hard-hearted? Woe to those whose hearts are hardened against celebrating the praises of God. They are clearly in error"
  39,23,"God has revealed the best hadith, a book consistent with itself, repeating. The skin of those who fear their Lord shivers from it. Then their skin and their hearts soften to the celebration of God's praises. Such is the guidance of God. He guides with it whom He pleases, but those who God leaves to stray, can have none to guide"
  39,24,"Is then one who has to fear the brunt of the penalty on the Day of Accountability on his face, like one guarded from it? It will be said to the wrongdoers, “Taste of what you earned.”"
  39,25,"Those before them also rejected it, and so the punishment came to them from directions they did not perceive"
  39,26,"So God gave them a taste of humiliation in the present life, but greater is the punishment of the hereafter, if they only knew"
  39,27,"We have put forth for humanity in this Quran, every kind of parable, in order that they may receive advice"
  39,28,"A Quran in Arabic, without anything out-of-place, in order that they may guard against wrong"
  39,29,"God puts forth a parable of a person belonging to many partners at odds with each other, and a person belonging entirely to one man. Are those two equal in comparison? Praise God, but most of them do not understand"
  39,30,"Truly you will die, and truly they will die"
  39,31,"In the end will you all, on the Day of Accountability, settle your disputes in the presence of your Lord. 31 (End of Part)"
