  90,1,I call to witness this city
  90,2,And you are free in this city
  90,3,As are the parent and child
  90,4,Indeed We have created the human being into toil and struggle
  90,5,Do they think that none has power over them

  90,14,Or giving food in a day of hunger
  90,15,To the orphan who claims relationship
