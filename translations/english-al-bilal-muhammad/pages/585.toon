quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and turned away
  80,2,Because there came to him the blind man
  80,3,But how could you know whether he might be purified
  80,4,"Or that he might receive advice, and the teaching might profit him"
  80,5,As for one who regards Himself as self-sufficient
  80,6,To him you attend
  80,7,Though it is no blame on you if he grows not
  80,8,But as to him who came to you striving earnestly
  80,9,And with consciousness
  80,10,Of him were you unmindful
  80,11,"By no means should this be so, for it is indeed a message of instruction"
  80,12,"So whosoever wills, may ponder it"
  80,13,In books held in honor
  80,14,Exalted and purified
  80,15,By the hands of scribes
  80,16,"Honorable, pious and just"
  80,17,"Woe to humanity, what has made them reject God"
  80,18,From what has He created them
  80,19,"From a zygote, He has created him, and then molds them in due proportions"
  80,20,Then He makes his path smooth for him
  80,21,"Then He causes him to die, and puts him in his grave"
  80,22,"Then, when it is His will, He will raise him up"
  80,23,By no means has he fulfilled what God has asked of him
  80,24,Then let the human being look at his food
  80,25,And that We pour out water in abundance
  80,26,And We split the earth into pieces
  80,27,And produce therein corn
  80,28,Grapes and nutritious plants
  80,29,Olives and dates
  80,30,"And enclosed gardens, dense with lofty trees"
  80,31,And fruits and fodder
  80,32,For use and convenience for you and your livestock
  80,33,Then when there comes the deafening noise
  80,34,The day one will flee from his own brother
  80,35,And from his mother and his father
  80,36,And from his wife and children
  80,37,"Each one of them, that day, will have enough concern to make him indifferent to the others"
  80,38,Some faces that day will be beaming
  80,39,"Laughing, rejoicing"
  80,40,And other faces that day will be dust-stained
  80,41,Darkness will cover them
  80,42,"Such will be the rejecters of God, the immoral"
