quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,"Though they will be put in sight of each other. Those who are corrupt, their desire will be that he could redeem himself from the penalty of that day with his children"
  70,12,"His wife, and his brother"
  70,13,His family who sheltered him
  70,14,"And all who are on earth, so that it could save him"
  70,15,"By no means, for it would be the fire of hell"
  70,16,Burning down to the skull
  70,17,Inviting all those who turn their backs and turn away their faces
  70,18,Collecting and hiding it
  70,19,Truly the human being was created impatient
  70,20,Depressed when harm touches him
  70,21,And arrogant when good reaches him
  70,22,Not so those who pray
  70,23,Those who stay focused on their prayer
  70,24,And those who recognize a right to their wealth
  70,25,"For those who ask, and those unable to ask"
  70,26,And those who hold to the truth of the Day of Accountability
  70,27,And those who fear the displeasure of their Lord
  70,28,For their Lord’s displeasure is unlike peace and tranquility
  70,29,And those who guard their chastity
  70,30,"Except with their spouses and those that their right hands possess, for they are not to be blamed"
  70,31,But those who trespass beyond this are transgressors
  70,32,And those who respect their trusts and covenants
  70,33,And those who stand firm in their testimonies
  70,34,And those who guard their worship
  70,35,These will be the honored ones in the gardens
  70,36,Now what is the matter with the unbelievers that they rush madly before you
  70,37,"From the right and from the left, in crowds"
  70,38,Does every person among them long to enter the garden of bliss
  70,39,"By no means, for We have created them from what they know"
