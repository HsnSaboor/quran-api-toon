  35,39,"It is He Who has made you inheritors in the earth. If any then reject God, their rejection will work against them. Their rejection only adds to disbelief for the unbelievers in the sight of their Lord. Their rejection only adds to their undoing"
  35,40,"Say, “Have you seen these partners of yours whom you call upon besides God? Show Me what it is they have created in the earth. Or have they a share in the heavens? Or have We given them a book from which they can derive guidance? No, the wrongdoers promise each other nothing but delusions"
  35,41,"It is God Who sustains the heavens and the earth, lest they cease to function, and if they should fail, there is none, not one, who can sustain them thereafter. Indeed He is Most Understanding, Oft-Forgiving"
  35,42,"They swore their strongest oath by God that if a warner came to them, they would follow his guidance better than any other people, but when a warner came to them, it only increased their flight"

  35,44,"Do they not travel through the earth, and see what the end of those before them was, though they were superior to them in strength? Nor is God to be escaped by anything in the heavens or on earth, for He is All Knowing, All Powerful"
