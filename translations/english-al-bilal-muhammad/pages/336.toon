quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,31,"Be true in faith to God, and never assign partners to Him. If anyone assigns partners to God, it is as if he had fallen from heaven, and had been snatched up by birds, or the wind had blown and thrown him into a distant place"
  22,32,"Whoever holds in honor the symbols of God, it should truly come from piety of heart"
  22,33,In them you have benefits for a term appointed. In the end their place of sacrifice is near the Ancient House
  22,34,"To every people We appointed rites that they might mention the name of God over the sustenance He gave them from animals. And your God is One God, so submit your will to Him, and give the good news to those who humble themselves"
  22,35,"They are those whose hearts, when God is mentioned, are filled with awe. Who show patient perseverance over their afflictions, establish prayer, and give out of what We have bestowed upon them"
  22,36,"And the sacrificial animal, We have made it for you among the symbols from God. In them is good for you. So remember the name of God over it as they line up, and when they are down on their sides. Then eat of it, and feed the needy who do not ask, and those who do. Thus We have made animals subject to you, that you may be grateful"
  22,37,"It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches God, it is your piety that reaches Him. He has made them subject to you, that you may praise God for His guidance to you, and proclaim the good news to all who do right"
  22,38,"Indeed God will defend those who believe, indeed God does not love any who is a traitor of faith or who shows ingratitude"
