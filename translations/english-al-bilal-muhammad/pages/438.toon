quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  35,31,"That which We have revealed to you of the Book is the truth reflecting the truth of what was revealed before it, for God is surely, to His servants, well acquainted and fully observant"
  35,32,"And We have given the Book for inheritance, to those of Our servants as We chose, but there are among them, some who wrong their own souls, some who follow a middle course, and some who are, by God's permission, foremost in good deeds, and that is the highest blessing"
  35,33,"They will enter Gardens of eternity, therein they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments will be of silk"
  35,34,"And they will say, “Praise God, Who has removed from us all sorrow, for our Lord is indeed oft-forgiving, ready to appreciate"
  35,35,"“He Who has, out of His bounty, settled us in a home that will last. Neither fatigue nor sense of weariness will touch us therein.”"
  35,36,"But those who reject God, for them will be the fire of hell. No term will be determined for them, thus not allowing them to die, nor will its penalty be lightened for them. This is how We reward every ungrateful one"
  35,37,"Therein will they cry aloud, “Our Lord, let us out. We will work righteously, not the deeds we used to do.” “Did We not give you a long enough life so that all could take the advice? And the warner came to you. So taste this, for the wrongdoers there is no helper.”"
  35,38,"Indeed God knows all the hidden things of the heavens and the earth, and indeed He has full knowledge of all that is in the heart"
