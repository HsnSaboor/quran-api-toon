quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"These are the ones who wait and watch. If you gain a victory from God they say, “Were we not with you?” But if the unbelievers gain a victory they say to them, “Did we not gain an advantage over you, and did we not guard you from the believers?” But God will judge between you on the Day of Accountability, and never will God grant to the unbelievers a way to triumph over the believers"
  4,142,"The hypocrites think they are over-reaching God, but He will over-reach them. When they stand up for prayer, they stand without earnestness, only to be seen by people. And little do they hold God in remembrance"
  4,143,"They are distracted in mind, even in the middle of it, being committed to neither one group nor the other. God leaves them straying, and never will you find for him the way"
  4,144,"O you who believe, take not for friends unbelievers rather than believers. Do you wish to offer God an open proof against you"
  4,145,"The hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the fire, no helper will you find for them"
  4,146,"Except for those who repent, mend their lives, hold fast to God, and redeem their ways in God's sight. If so, they will be numbered with the believers. And soon will God grant to the believers a reward of immense value"
  4,147,"What can God gain by your punishment, if you are grateful and believe? No, it is God Who recognizes good, and knows all things. 147 (End of Part)"
