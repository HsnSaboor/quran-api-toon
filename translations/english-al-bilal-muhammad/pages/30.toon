quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,191,"And slay them wherever you catch them. And drive them out from where they have driven you out, for oppression is worse than slaughter. But do not fight them at the Sacred Masjid, unless they attack you there, and if they attack you, slay them. Such is the punishment of those who suppress faith"
  2,192,"But if they cease, indeed God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming"
  2,193,"And fight against them until there is no more oppression, and justice prevails, as does faith in God. But if they cease, let there be no hostility to any except those who practice oppression"
  2,194,"The prohibited month for the prohibited month, and so for all things prohibited, there is the law of equality. But if anyone transgresses the prohibition against you, respond likewise against him, but be aware of God, and know that God is with those who show restraint"
  2,195,"And give of your sustenance in the cause of God, and do not make your hands contribute to your own destruction. But do good, for God loves those who do good"
  2,196,"And complete the Hajj and ‘Umra in service of God. But if you are prevented, send something of value which is manageable. And do not shave your heads until the offering reaches the place of sacrifice. And if any of you are sick, or has an ailment in his scalp, he should in exchange either fast, feed the poor, or offer sacrifice. When ready, if anyone wishes to continue the ‘Umra, on to the Hajj, he must make an offering, such as he can afford. But if he cannot afford it, he should fast three days during the Hajj and seven days on his return, making ten days in all. This is for those whose household is not in the Sacred Masjid. And be aware of God, and know that God is strict in punishment"
