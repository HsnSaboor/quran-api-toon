  41,47,"To Him is referred the knowledge of the Hour. No date-fruit comes out of its sheath, nor does a female conceive or deliver on the day that God will ask them, “Where are the partners you associated with Me?” They will say, “We assure you, not one of us can bear witness.”"
  41,48,"The deities they used to invoke will leave them, but they will see that they have no way to escape"

  41,50,"When we give him a taste of some mercy from Ourselves, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say, “This is due to me. I do not think the Hour will be established, but if I am brought back to my Lord, I have enough good stored in His sight.” But We will show the unbelievers the truth of all that they did, and We will give them the taste of a severe penalty"
  41,51,"When We bestow favor on the human being, he turns away and distances himself, and when harm seizes him, he comes full of prolonged prayer"
