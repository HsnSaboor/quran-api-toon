quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,6,There is no moving creature on earth whose sustenance does not depend on God. He knows the time and place of its activity and its place of rest. All is in a clear record
  11,7,"He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and His throne was over the waters, so that He would make evident which of you is best in conduct. But if you were to say to them, “You will indeed be raised up after death,” the unbelievers would be sure to say, “This is nothing but obvious delusion.”"
  11,8,"If We delay the penalty for them for a definite term, they are sure to say, “What keeps it back?” On the day it reaches them, nothing will keep it back, and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock"
  11,9,"If We give a man a taste of mercy from Ourselves, and then withdraw it from him, behold, he is in despair and falls into blasphemy"
  11,10,"But if We give him a taste of Our favors after adversity has touched him, he is sure to say, “All problems have left me.” Behold, he falls into exultation and pride"
  11,11,"Not so do those who show patience and constancy, and work righteousness, for them is forgiveness and a great reward"
  11,12,"Perhaps you may want to give up a part of what is revealed to you, and your heart feels distressed when they say, “Why is a treasure not sent down to him, or why does an angel not come down with him?” But you are there only to warn, God manages everything"
