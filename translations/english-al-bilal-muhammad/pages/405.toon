  30,9,"Do they not travel through the earth, and see what the end of those before them was? They were superior to them in strength. They tilled the soil and populated it in greater numbers than these have. There came to them their messengers with guidance which they rejected to their own peril. It was not God Who wronged them, but they wronged their own souls"
