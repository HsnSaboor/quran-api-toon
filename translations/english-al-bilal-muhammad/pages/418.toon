quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  33,1,"O Prophet, be conscious of God and do not listen to the unbelievers nor the hypocrites, indeed God is full of Knowledge and Wisdom"
  33,2,"But follow that which comes to you by inspiration from your Lord, for God is well acquainted with all that you do"
  33,3,"And put your trust in God, and enough is God as a manager of affairs"
  33,4,"God has not made for any person two hearts in his one body, nor has He made your wives whom you divorce by Zihar your mothers, nor has He made those who you call sons, your sons. These are your sayings, but God tells you the truth, and He shows the right way"
  33,5,"Call them by the names of their fathers. That is more just in the sight of God, but if you do not know their father’s names, call them your brothers in faith, or your friends, but there is no blame on you if you make a mistake concerning this. What counts is the intention of your hearts, and God is Oft-Returning, Mercifully Redeeming"
  33,6,"The prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are their mothers. But blood relatives among you have closer personal ties in the decree of God, than the community of believers and Muhajirs. But still do what is just to your closest friends. Such is the writing in the decree of God"
