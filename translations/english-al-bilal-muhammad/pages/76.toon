quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,195,"And their Lord accepted this from them and answered, “Never will I cause to be lost the work of any of you, be they male or female. You are connected, one to the other. Those who have left their homes, or have been banished from it, or suffered harm in My cause, or fought or have been slain, I will indeed remove from them their sins, and admit them into gardens with rivers flowing beneath. A reward from the presence of God, and from His presence is the best of rewards.”"
  3,196,Let not the strutting about of the unbelievers through the land deceive you
  3,197,Little is their enjoyment. Their ultimate abode is hell– the torturous tomb of misery
  3,198,"But for those who are conscious of their Lord are gardens with rivers flowing beneath, there they will dwell forever, a gift from the presence of God, and that which is in the presence of God is best for the righteous"
  3,199,"And there are certainly among the people of the Book, those who believe in God, in the revelation sent to you, and in the revelation sent to them, bowing in humility to God. They will not sell the signs of God for a miserable gain, for them is a reward with their Lord, and God is swift in account"
  3,200,"O you who believe, persevere in patience and constancy, compete in such perseverance, strengthen each other, and be conscious of God, so that you may flourish"
