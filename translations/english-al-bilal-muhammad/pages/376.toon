  26,207,"It will not profit them, that they enjoyed this life"
  26,208,"Never did We destroy a population, except those who had been warned"
  26,209,"By way of reminder, and We are never unjust"
  26,210,No devils have brought down this revelation
  26,211,It would neither suit them nor would they be able to produce it
  26,212,Indeed they have been removed far from even the chance of hearing it
  26,213,"So do not call on any other god with God, or you will be among those under the penalty"
  26,214,And advise your nearest relatives
  26,215,And lower your wing to the believers who follow you
  26,216,"Then if they ignore you say, “I am free from responsibility for what you do.”"
  26,217,"And put your trust in the Exalted in Might, the Merciful Redeemer"
  26,218,The One who sees you standing in prayer
  26,219,And your movements among those who prostrate themselves
  26,220,For it is He Who hears and knows all things

  26,223,"They repeat what they hear, though most of the deny it"
  26,224,"And of the poets, it is the misguided who follow them"
  26,225,Do you not see that they roam in every lowland
  26,226,And that they say what they do not do
  26,227,"Except those who believe, work righteousness, engage much in the remembrance of God, and defend themselves after they are unjustly attacked, and soon the assailants will know at what misfortune they will arrive"
