quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  22,73,"O humanity, here is a parable put forward, listen to it. Those on whom you call other than God, cannot even create a fly, even if they all met together for the purpose, and if the fly snatches away anything from them, they would have no power to release it from the fly. Feeble are those who petition, as are those whom they petition"
  22,74,"No just estimate have they made of God, for God is He Who is strong and able to carry out His will"
  22,75,"God chooses messengers from angels and from human beings, for God is He Who hears and sees all things"
  22,76,He knows what is before them and what is behind them and to God go back all questions
  22,77,"O you who believe, bow down, prostrate yourselves, adore your Lord, and do good, so that you may flourish"
  22,78,"And strive in His cause, as you ought to strive. He has chosen you, and has imposed no difficulties on you in this way, it is the way of your father Abraham. It is He Who has named you Muslims, both before and in this revelation, that the messenger may be a witness for you, and you are witnesses for humanity. So establish prayer, give zakat, and hold fast to God. He is your Protector, the best to protect and the best to help. (End of Part)"
