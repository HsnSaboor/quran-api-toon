quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  8,17,"It is not you who slew them, but it was God. When you threw a handful of dust, it was not your act, but God's, in order that He might challenge the believers by a gracious trial from Himself, for God is He Who hears and knows all things"
  8,18,"That, and because God is He Who makes weak the plans and strategy of the unbelievers"
  8,19,"If you prayed for victory and judgment, judgment has now come to you. If you stop, it will be best for you. If you return to the attack, so will We. Not the least good will your forces be to you even if they were multiplied, for indeed God is with those who believe"
  8,20,"O you who believe, follow God and His messenger, and do not turn away from him when you hear him speak"
  8,21,"Nor be like those who say, “We hear, but do not listen"
  8,22,"For the worst of creatures in the sight of God are the deaf and the dumb, those who understand not"
  8,23,"If God had found in them any good, He would indeed have made them listen. If He had made them listen, they would have turned back and rejected"
  8,24,"O you who believe, respond to God and His messenger when he calls you to that which will give you life, and know that God hovers between a person and his heart, and to Him you all will be gathered"
  8,25,"And be aware of trials which affects not only those of you who do wrong, and know that God is strict in punishment"
