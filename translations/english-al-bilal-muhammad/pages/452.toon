quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you? How judge you
  37,155,Will you not then receive advice
  37,156,Or have you an authority manifest
  37,157,Then bring your book if you are truthful
  37,158,And they have created a blood relationship between Him and the jinn. But the jinn know that they have indeed to appear
  37,159,"Glory be to God, He is free from the things they ascribe to Him"
  37,160,"Not so the servants of God, sincere and devoted"
  37,161,Indeed neither you nor those you worship
  37,162,Can lead any into temptation concerning God
  37,163,Except those whom are themselves heading to the blazing fire
  37,164,"“Not us, only for him is a place known"
  37,165,“And indeed we are arranged in ranks
  37,166,“And we are indeed those who declare God's glory.”
  37,167,And there were those who said
  37,168,“If only we had before us a message from those in the past
  37,169,"“We would certainly have been servants of God, sincere.”"
  37,170,"So they reject it, but soon will they know"
  37,171,Our word has already been passed on before to Our servants sent by Us
  37,172,So that they would certainly be assisted
  37,173,And that Our forces surely must conquer
  37,174,So turn away from them for a little while
  37,175,"And watch them, and they soon will see"
  37,176,Do they wish to rush our punishment
  37,177,"But when it descends into the open space before them, terrible will be the morning for those who were warned"
  37,178,So turn away from them for a little while
  37,179,And watch and they soon will see
  37,180,"Glory to your Lord, the Lord of Honor and Power, free from what they ascribe to Him"
  37,181,And peace on the messengers
  37,182,"And praise God, the Guardian Evolver of all the worlds"
