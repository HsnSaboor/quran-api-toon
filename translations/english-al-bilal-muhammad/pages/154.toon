  7,31,"O children of Adam, take your zeenah with you to every place of prayer. Eat and drink, but waste not by excess, for God does not love wasters"
  7,32,"Say, “Who has forbidden the beautiful gifts of God which He has produced for His servants, and the things clean and pure for sustenance?” Say, “They are in the life of the present for those who believe, and exclusively for them on the Day of Accountability.” Thus We explain the signs in detail for those who understand"
  7,33,"Say, “The things that my Lord has indeed made forbidden are shameful deeds whether open or secret, deeds and ideas against truth and reason, assigning partners to God for which He has revealed no authority, and saying things about God which you do not know.”"
  7,34,To every people is a term appointed. When their term is reached not an hour can they delay or advance it
  7,35,"O you children of Adam, there comes to you messengers from among you, rehearsing My signs to you, those who are righteous and mend their lives, on them will be no fear, nor shall they grieve"
  7,36,"But those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance, they are companions of the fire, and will dwell in there forever"
  7,37,"Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against God, or rejects His signs? For them, their appointed portion must reach them from the Book. Until when our messengers arrive and take their souls and they say, “Where are the things that you used to invoke besides God?” They will reply, “They have left us lost,” and they will bear witness against themselves, because they rejected it"
