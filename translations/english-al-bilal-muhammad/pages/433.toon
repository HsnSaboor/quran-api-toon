quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,40,"One day He will gather them all together and say to the angels, “Was it you that these people used to worship?”"
  34,41,"They will say, “Glory to You, Our tie is with You as a Protector, not with them. No, but they worshipped the jinn. Most of them believed in them.”"
  34,42,"So on that day, no power will they have over each other, for profit or harm, and We will say to the wrongdoers, “Taste the penalty of the fire which you used to deny.”"
  34,43,"When Our clear signs are rehearsed to them they say, “This is only a person who wishes to hinder you from the worship which your parents practiced.” And they say, “This is only a lie invented.” And the unbelievers say of the truth when it comes to them, “This is nothing but obvious deception.”"
  34,44,"But We had not given them books which they could study, nor sent messengers to them before you as warners"
  34,45,"And their predecessors rejected the truth, these have not received a tenth of what We had granted to those. Yet when they rejected My messengers, how terrible My rejection of them was"
  34,46,"Say, “I advise you on one point. That you should stand up before God, whether it is in pairs, or it is individually, and reflect within yourselves. Your companion is not possessed. He is no less than a warner to you, in face of a terrible penalty.”"
  34,47,"Say, “No reward do I ask of you. It is all in your interest. My reward is only due from God, and He is witness to all things.”"
  34,48,"Say, “Indeed my Lord gives the truth, He Who has full knowledge of all that is hidden.”"
