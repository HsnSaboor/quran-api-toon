quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,104,"When it is said to them, “Come to what God has revealed, come to the messenger. They say, “Enough for us are the ways we found our fathers following.” What, even though their fathers were void of knowledge and guidance"
  5,105,"O you who believe, guard your souls. If you follow guidance, no harm can come to you from those who stray. The goal of you all is to God. He will show you the truth of all that you do"
  5,106,"O you who believe, when death approaches any of you, take witnesses among yourselves when making wills, take two just people from your brothers, or two others from outside if you are journeying through the earth and the chance of death befalls you. If you doubt their words, keep them both after prayer, and let them both swear by God, “We do not want any worldly gain, even though the beneficiary is a near relative. We will not hide the proof before God, and if we do, then behold, the sin is on us.”"
  5,107,"But if it becomes known that these two were guilty of this sin, let two others stand forth in their place, those nearest in family from among those who claim a lawful right. Let them swear by God that, “We affirm that our witness is truer than that of those two, and that we have not trespassed beyond the truth. If we did, behold, the harm is on us.”"
  5,108,"That is most suitable, that they may give the evidence in its true form, or else they should fear that other testimonies would be taken over their testimony. So be conscious of God, and listen, for God does not guide a rebellious people"
