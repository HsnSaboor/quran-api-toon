  50,36,But how many generations before them did We destroy who were stronger in power than they were? Then they wandered through the land. Was there any place of escape for them

  50,38,"We created the heavens and the earth, and all between them in six days, and no sense of weariness touched Us"

  50,41,And listen for the day when the caller will call out from a near place
  50,42,"The day when they will hear a mighty blast. In fact, that will be the Day of Resurrection"
  50,43,"Indeed it is We Who give life and death, and to Us is the final goal"
  50,44,The day when the earth will be split asunder from people hurrying out. That will be a gathering together that is easy for Us
  50,45,"We know best what they say, and you are not one to overwhelm them by force. So advise with the Quran, those who fear My warning"
  51,1,By that which scatters by broadcast
  51,2,And those who lift and bear heavy weights
  51,3,And those who flow with ease and gentleness
  51,4,And those who distribute influence
  51,5,Indeed that which you are promised is true
  51,6,And indeed judgment and justice must come to pass
