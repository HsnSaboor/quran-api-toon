  14,6,"Remember Moses said to his people, “Call to mind the favor of God to you, when He delivered you from the people of Pharaoh. They gave you hard work and punished you, slaughtered your sons, and let your females live. This was a tremendous trial from your Lord.”"
  14,7,"And remember, your Lord caused to be declared, “If you are grateful, I will give you more, but if you show ingratitude, truly My punishment is terrible indeed.”"
  14,8,"And Moses said, “Do not show ingratitude, you and all those on earth, but God is free of all wants, worthy of all praise"
  14,9,"Has the story not reached you of those who went before? Of the people of Noah, ‘Ad, Thamud, and of those after them? None knows of them but God. To them came messengers with clear signs, but they put their hands up to their mouths and said, “We deny the mission which you have been sent, and we are really in suspicious doubt as to that which you invite us.”"
  14,10,"Their messengers said, “Is there any doubt about God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? It is He Who invites you in order that He may forgive you your sins, and give you respite for a term appointed.” They said, “You are no more than human, like us. If you wish to turn us away from the gods our parents used to worship, then bring us some clear authority.”"
