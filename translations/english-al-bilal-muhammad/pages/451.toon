  37,127,"But they rejected him, and they will certainly be called up"
  37,128,Except the sincere and devoted servants of God
  37,129,And We left this blessing for him among generations to come

  37,150,Or did you see Us create the angels female
  37,151,Is it not that they say falsely
  37,152,“God has children”? But they are liars
