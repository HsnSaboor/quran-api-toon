quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  4,20,"But if you decide to place a spouse in the place of the other, even if you had given the latter a whole treasure as a dowry, do not take the least bit of it back. Would you take it by slander and manifest wrong"
  4,21,"And how could you take it when you have bonded with each other, and they have taken from you a solemn covenant"
  4,22,"Do not marry women whom your fathers married, except what has undoubtedly passed. It was immoral and detestable, an abominable custom indeed"
  4,23,"Prohibited to you for marriage are your mothers, daughters, sisters, father’s sisters, mother’s sisters, brother’s daughters, sister’s daughters, foster-mothers, foster-sisters, your wives’ mothers, your step-daughters under your guardianship born of your wives to whom you have been intimate, no prohibition if you have not been intimate, those who have been wives of your sons proceeding from your loins, and two sisters in wedlock at the same time, except what has undoubtedly passed, for God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming. 23 (End of Part)"
