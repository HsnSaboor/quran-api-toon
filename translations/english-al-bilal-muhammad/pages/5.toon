quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,25,"But give the good news to those who believe and work righteousness, that their reward is gardens with rivers flowing through them. Every time they are fed with fruits from it they say, “This is what we were fed with before.” They are given similar things, they have therein companions who are pure, and they will live there forever"
  2,26,"God does not hesitate to use examples of the lowest of things as well as the highest. Those who believe know that this is the truth from their Lord, but those who do not believe say, “What does God mean by this parable?” By it He allows many to stray, and many He leads to the straight path, but He allows none to stray except those who leave the path"
  2,27,"Those who break God's sacred agreement after it is confirmed, and who separate what God has ordered to be joined, and do wrong on earth, these cause harm to themselves"
  2,28,"How can you lose faith in God, seeing that you were without life, and He gave you life? Then He will cause you to die, and will again bring you to life, and again to Him you will return"
  2,29,"It is He Who has created for you all things that are on earth, then He turned to the heaven, and fashioned it into seven firmaments, and He has perfect knowledge of all things"
