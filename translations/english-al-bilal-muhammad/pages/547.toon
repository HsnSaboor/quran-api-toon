quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  59,10,"And those who came after them say, “Our Lord, forgive us, and our brothers who came before us into the faith, and do not leave in our hearts hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord, You are indeed Full of Kindness, the Merciful Redeemer.”"
  59,11,"Did you not observe the hypocrites that said to their misbelieving brothers among the people of the Book? “If you are expelled, we too will go out with you, and we will never listen to anyone concerning your situation, and if you are attacked we will help you.” But God is witness that they are indeed liars"
  59,12,"If they are expelled, never will they go out with them, and if they are attacked, they will never help them, and if they do help them, they will turn their backs, so that they will receive no help"
  59,13,"Truthfully, you are stronger because of the fear in their hearts sent by God. This is because they are people void of understanding"
  59,14,"They will not even fight you together, except in a fortified town, or from behind walls. Strong is their fighting among themselves. You would think they were united, but their hearts are divided. That is because they are a people devoid of wisdom"
  59,15,"Like those of late. They have tasted the harmful result of their conduct, and for them is a terrible penalty"
  59,16,"Like Satan, when he says to the human being, “Deny God.” But once he denies God he says, “I disassociate myself from you. I fear God, the Guardian Evolver of all the systems of knowledge.”"
