quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,46,"And in their footsteps, We sent Jesus the son of Mary, reflecting the truth of the Law that had come before him. We sent him the gospel, containing guidance and light, a reflection of the truth of the Law that had come before him, guidance and advice to those who are conscious"
  5,47,"Let the people of the gospel judge by what God has revealed in it. If any fail to make decisions using what God has revealed, they are those who are not at peace"
  5,48,"To you We sent the Scripture in truth, reflecting the truth of the Scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety. So judge between them by what God has revealed, and do not follow their vain desires, diverging from the truth that has come to you. To each one among you We have prescribed a law and a clear way. If God had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but His plan is to challenge you with what He has given you. So strive as in a race to all virtues. The goal of you all is to God. It is He Who will show you the truth of that which you dispute"
  5,49,"And judge between them by what God has revealed. And do not follow their selfish desires, but beware of them, so that they will not mislead you from that which God has sent down to you. And if they turn away, know that for some of their sins it is God's will to punish them. And indeed most people are rebellious"
  5,50,"Do they then seek a judgment of ignorance? But who, for a people whose faith is assured, can give better judgment than God"
