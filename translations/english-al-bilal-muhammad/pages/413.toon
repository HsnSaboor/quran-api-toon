quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  31,20,"Do you not see that God has subjected to your use, all things in the heavens and on earth, and has made his bounties flow to you in exceeding measure, both seen and unseen?

  31,22,"Whoever submits his whole self to God, and is a doer of good, has indeed grasped the most trustworthy handhold, and with God rests the end and the decision of all affairs"

  31,25,"If you ask them who it is that created the heavens and the earth they will certainly say, “God.” Say, “Praise God.” But most of them do not understand"
  31,26,"To God belong all things in heaven and earth, indeed God is He Who is free of all wants, worthy of all praise"
  31,27,"And if all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean were ink, with seven oceans behind it to add to its supply, still the words of God would not be exhausted, for God is Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom"
