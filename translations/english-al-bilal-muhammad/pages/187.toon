  9,2,"Go then for four months, backward and forward throughout the land, but know that you cannot stop God, but that God will cover with shame those who reject Him"
  9,3,"And announce from God and His messenger, to the people on the day of the Great Hajj, that God and His messenger dissolves your obligations to the pagans. If you then repent, it is best for you. But if you turn away, know that you cannot stop God. And proclaim a terrible penalty to those who do not believe"
  9,4,"But the treaties are not dissolved with those pagans with whom you have entered into an alliance, and who have not since failed you concerning anything, nor aided anyone against you. So fulfill your responsibility to them to the end of their term, for God loves the righteous"
  9,5,"But when the forbidden months have passed, fight and slay the pagans wherever you find them. And seize them, surround them, and lie and wait for them with every strategy of war.

  9,6,"If anyone among the pagans asks you for asylum, grant it to him, so that he may hear the word of God. Then escort him to where he can be secure, because they are people without knowledge"
