  53,45,"That He created in pairs, male and female"
  53,46,From a zygote when lodged in its place
  53,47,That He has promised a second creation
  53,48,That it is He Who gives wealth and satisfaction
  53,49,That He is the Lord of Sirius
  53,50,"And that it is He Who caused to perish, the ancient ‘Ad people"
