quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,“So no friend has he here this day
  69,36,"“Nor has he any food, except of what remains from the washing of wounds"
  69,37,“Which none eat but the wrong-doers.”
  69,38,So I call to witness what you see
  69,39,And what you see not
  69,40,That this is indeed the word of an honored messenger
  69,41,It is not the word of a poet. Little is it you believe
  69,42,Nor is it the word of an oracle. Little advice is it you receive
  69,43,A message sent down from the Lord of all worlds
  69,44,And if the messenger were to invent any sayings in Our name
  69,45,We would certainly seize him by his right hand
  69,46,Then We would certainly cut off the artery of his heart
  69,47,Nor could any of you protect him
  69,48,But indeed this is a message for those who are conscious
  69,49,And We certainly know that there are among you those who reject it
  69,50,But truly it is a cause of sorrow for the unbelievers
  69,51,But indeed it is certainly true
  69,52,"So glorify the name of your Lord, Most High"
  70,1,A questioner asked about a penalty to befall
  70,2,The unbelievers which there is none to ward off
  70,3,"A penalty from God, Lord of the ways of ascent"
  70,4,The angels and the spirit ascend to him in a day the duration of fifty thousand years
  70,5,"Therefore be patient, beautifully patient"
  70,6,They see it as indeed distant
  70,7,But We see it as near
  70,8,The day that the sky will be like molten brass
  70,9,And the mountains will be like wool
  70,10,And no friend will ask about a friend
