quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star when it goes down
  53,2,Your companion is neither astray nor being misled
  53,3,Nor does he say anything of his own volition
  53,4,It is no less than inspiration sent down to him
  53,5,He was taught by one mighty in power
  53,6,"Endued with wisdom, for he appeared"
  53,7,While he was in the highest part of the horizon
  53,8,Then he approached and came closer
  53,9,And was at a distance of only two bow-lengths or nearer
  53,10,So God conveyed the inspiration to His servant which He meant to convey
  53,11,His heart in no way falsified that which he saw
  53,12,Will you then dispute with him concerning what he saw
  53,13,For indeed he saw him at a second descent
  53,14,Near the lotus-tree beyond which none may pass
  53,15,Near is the garden of abode
  53,16,"Behold, the lotus-tree was shrouded"
  53,17,"His sight never deviated, nor did it go wrong"
  53,18,"For truly he saw the signs of his Lord, the Greatest"
  53,19,Have you seen Lat and ‘Uzza
  53,20,"And another, the third, Manat"
  53,21,"What, for you the male, and for Him, the female"
  53,22,"Behold, that would indeed be a division unfair"
  53,23,"These are nothing but names which you have made up, you and your fathers, for which God has sent down no authority. They follow nothing but speculation, and what their own soul’s desire. Even though there has already come to them guidance from their Lord"
  53,24,"No, will human beings have everything they pursue"
  53,25,But it is to God that the end and the beginning belong
  53,26,"However many angels there are in the heavens, their intercession will avail them nothing, except after God has given permission to whom He pleases, and that they are acceptable to Him"
