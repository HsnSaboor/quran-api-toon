quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  35,12,"Nor are the two bodies of flowing water alike, the one palatable, sweet, and pleasant to drink, and the other, salty and bitter. Yet from each kind of water do you eat meat fresh and tender, and you extract ornaments to wear, and you see the ships in it that plow the waves, so that you may seek the bounty of God, and that you may be grateful"
  35,13,"He merges night into day, and He merges day into night, and He has subjected the Sun and the Moon to His law. Each one runs its course for a term appointed. Such is God your Lord. To Him belongs all control, and those whom you invoke besides Him have no power in the least"
  35,14,"If you invoke them, they will not listen to your call, and if they were to listen, they could not answer you. On the Day of Accountability, they will reject your partnership, and none can inform you like the One who is acquainted with all things"
  35,15,"O you people, it is you who have need of God, but God is the One free of all wants, worthy of all praise"
  35,16,"If He so pleased, He could remove you and bring about a new creation"
  35,17,Nor is that difficult for God
  35,18,"Nor can a bearer of burdens bear another’s burdens. If one heavily laden should call another to his load, not the least portion of it can be carried by the other, even if they are nearly related. You can only advise those who fear their Lord unseen, and establish prayer. And whoever purifies himself does so for the benefit of his own soul, and the destination is to God"
