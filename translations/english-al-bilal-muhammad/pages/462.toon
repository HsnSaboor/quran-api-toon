quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  39,32,"Who then does more wrong than one who tells a lie concerning God, and rejects the truth when it comes to him. Should hell not be a home for blasphemers"
  39,33,But he who brings the truth and he who confirms it. Such are the people who do right
  39,34,They will have all that they wish for in the presence of their Lord. Such is the reward for those who do right
  39,35,"So that God will turn away from them the worst of their deeds, and give them their reward according to the best of what they have done"
  39,36,"Is God not enough for his servant? But they threaten you with others besides Him. For those who God leaves to stray, there can be no guide"
  39,37,"And those who God guides, there can be none to lead astray. Is God not Exalted in Power, Lord of Retribution"
  39,38,"If you ask them who it is that created the heavens and the earth, they would be sure to say, “God.” Say, “Then do you see what you invoke besides God? Can they, if God wills some penalty for me, remove His penalty? Or if He wills some benefit for me, can they keep back His grace?” Say, “Sufficient is God for me. Those who are trusting, trust Him.”"
  39,39,"Say, “O my people, do whatever you can, I will do my part, but soon will you know—"
  39,40,"“Who it is to whom comes a penalty of disgrace, and on whom descends a penalty that persists.”"
