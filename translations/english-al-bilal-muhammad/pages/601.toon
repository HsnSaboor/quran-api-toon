quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By time
  103,2,Indeed the human being is lost
  103,3,"Except those who have faith, work to make things right, and join together in the mutual teaching of truth, patience, and constancy"
  104,1,"Woe to every scandalous, backbiter"
  104,2,Who accumulates wealth and counts it
  104,3,Thinking that his wealth will make him last forever
  104,4,By no means. He will surely be thrown into that which breaks into pieces
  104,5,And what will explain to you about that which breaks into pieces
  104,6,It is the fire of God kindled to a blaze
  104,7,That mounts right up to the hearts
  104,8,It will be made into a vault over them
  104,9,"In columns, extended"
  105,1,Do you not see how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant
  105,2,Did He not make their treacherous plan go astray
  105,3,And He sent against them flocks of birds
  105,4,Striking them with stones of baked clay
  105,5,Then He made them like an empty field of stalks and straw which has been eaten
