quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,None will reach it but the most unfortunate ones
  92,16,Who give the lie to truth and turn their backs
  92,17,But those most devote will be removed far from it
  92,18,Those who give their wealth for self-purification
  92,19,"And have in their minds no favor from anyone, for which a reward is expected in return"
  92,20,But only the desire to seek for the Countenance of their Lord Most High
  92,21,And soon will they attain satisfaction
  93,1,By the glorious morning light
  93,2,And by the night when it is still
  93,3,"Your Lord has not abandoned you, nor is He displeased"
  93,4,And indeed the future will be better for you than the present
  93,5,And soon your Lord will give you that with which you will be well pleased
  93,6,Did He not find you an orphan and give you shelter
  93,7,"And He found you wandering, and He gave you guidance"
  93,8,"And He found you in need, and made you independent"
  93,9,"Therefore, treat not the orphan with harshness"
  93,10,Nor refuse the petitioner
  93,11,"But the bounty of your Lord, proclaim"
  94,1,Have We not expanded your chest
  94,2,And removed from you your burden
  94,3,Which galled your back
  94,4,And raised high the esteem you are held
  94,5,"So indeed, with every difficulty there is relief"
  94,6,"Indeed, with every difficulty there is relief"
  94,7,"Therefore, when you are free, still labor hard"
  94,8,And turn all of your attention to your Lord
