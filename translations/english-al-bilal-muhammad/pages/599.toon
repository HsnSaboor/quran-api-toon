quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  98,8,"Their reward with God is gardens of eternity, beneath which rivers flow, they will dwell therein forever, God well pleased with them, and they with Him. All this for those who are conscious of their Lord"
  99,1,When the earth is shaken to its utmost convulsion
  99,2,And the earth throws up its burden
  99,3,"And the human being yells, “What is the matter with it?”"
  99,4,On that day it will declare its information
  99,5,Because your Lord would have given it inspiration
  99,6,"On that day, humanity will proceed in groups sorted out, to be shown their deeds"
  99,7,Then anyone who has done an atom’s weight of good see it
  99,8,And anyone who has done an atom’s weight of wrong will see it
  100,1,By those who race with panting breath
  100,2,And strike sparks of fire
  100,3,And push home the charge in the morning
  100,4,And raise the dust in clouds
  100,5,And move forward en masse
  100,6,Truly the human being is ungrateful to their Guardian Evolver
  100,7,And to that they bear witness
  100,8,And violent is their love of wealth
  100,9,"Does he not know, when that which is in the graves is scattered abroad"
