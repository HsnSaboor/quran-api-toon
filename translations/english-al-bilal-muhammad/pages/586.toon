quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun is folded up
  81,2,"When the stars fall, losing their luster"
  81,3,When the mountains vanish
  81,4,"When the she-camels, ten months with young, are left untended"
  81,5,When the wild creatures are herded together
  81,6,When the oceans are made to overflow
  81,7,When the souls are sorted out
  81,8,When the female infant buried alive is asked
  81,9,For what crime she was killed
  81,10,When the scrolls are laid open
  81,11,When the world on high is unveiled
  81,12,When the blazing fire is kindled to a fierce blaze
  81,13,And when the garden is brought near
  81,14,Then will each soul know what it has put forward
  81,15,So indeed I call to witness the planets that recede
  81,16,Go straight or hide
  81,17,And the night as it disappears
  81,18,And the dawn as it breathes away the darkness
  81,19,Indeed it is the word of an honorable messenger
  81,20,"Endued with power, with rank before the Lord of the throne"
  81,21,"With authority there, and faithful to his trust"
  81,22,And your companion is not one possessed
  81,23,And without doubt he saw him on the clear horizon
  81,24,He neither grudgingly withholds knowledge of the unknown
  81,25,Nor is it the word of Satan
  81,26,So where are you going
  81,27,Indeed it is no less than a message to all the worlds
  81,28,For whomever among you wills to go straight
  81,29,"But you will not will, except as God wills, the Lord of all the worlds"
