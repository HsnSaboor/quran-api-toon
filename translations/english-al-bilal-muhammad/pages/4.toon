quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"Their likeness is that of a man who kindled a fire. When it lights all around him, God took away his light and left them in darkness"
  2,18,"Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return to the path"
  2,19,"Or it is like that of a rain-laden cloud from the sky. In it are zones of darkness, thunder and lightning. They press their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunderclap, while in fear of death, but God encompasses those who reject faith"
  2,20,"The lightning nearly snatches away their sight. Every time the light flashes before them they walk in it. But when darkness covers them they stand still. And if God willed, He could take away their ability to hear and see, for God has power over all things"
  2,21,"O you people, adore your Guardian Lord, Who created you and those who came before you, that you may become righteous"
  2,22,"Who has made the earth your couch, and the skies your canopy, and sent down rain from the skies, and grew with it fruits for your sustenance. So do not set up rivals with God when you know the truth"
  2,23,"And if you are in doubt as to what We have revealed from time to time to Our servant, then produce a Surah like it, and call your witnesses or helpers, besides God, if your doubts are true"
  2,24,"But if you cannot, and surely you cannot, then be aware of the fire whose fuel is people and stones, which is prepared for those who reject faith"
