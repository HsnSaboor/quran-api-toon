  2,220,"This life and the hereafter. They ask you concerning orphans. Say, “The best things to do is what is best for them.

He is indeed the Exalted in Power.”"
  2,221,"Do not marry disbelieving women until they believe. A slave woman who believes is better than a disbelieving woman is, though she is attractive to you. Nor marry disbelieving men until they believe. A slave man who believes is better than a disbeliever is, even though he is attractive to you.

  2,222,"They ask you concerning women’s menses. Say, “It is a renewal. Thus decline them during their menses, nor go unto them until they are renewed.

  2,223,"Your wives are tilth to you. So approach your tilth when and how you two decide. But do some good acts for yourselves beforehand, and be conscious of God, and know that you are to meet Him. And give good news to those who believe"
  2,224,"And do not make God an excuse in your promises against doing good, or acting right, or making peace between people. For God is the One who hears and knows all things"
