quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  58,1,"God has indeed heard the statement of the woman who pleads with you concerning her husband, directing her complaint to God, and God hears the arguments between both sides among you, for God hears and sees all things"
  58,2,"Some men among you attempt to divorce their wives by Zihar, by prohibiting himself from relations with her as he would his mother, but they are not their mothers. None can be their mothers except those who gave birth to them, so in fact, they use words that are both hurtful and false, but truly God is the One who corrects and forgives you"
  58,3,"But those who divorce their wives by Zihar, then wish to go back on the words they spoke, should free a slave before they touch each other. This you are advised to perform, and God is well acquainted with all that you do"
  58,4,"And if any do not have the means, he should fast for two months consecutively, before they touch each other, but if any are unable to do so, he should feed sixty indigent ones, in order that you may show your belief in God and His messenger. Those are limits set by God, and for those who reject Him, there is a terrible penalty"
  58,5,"Those who resist God and His messenger will be humbled to dust, as were those before them, for We have already sent down clear signs, and the unbelievers will have a crushing penalty"
  58,6,"On the day that God will raise them all and show them the truth of their conduct. God has decreed its value though they may have forgotten it, for God is witness to all things"
