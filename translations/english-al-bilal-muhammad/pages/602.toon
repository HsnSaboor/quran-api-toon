quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,For the security enjoyed by the Quraysh
  106,2,Their security covering journeys by winter and summer
  106,3,Let them adore the Guardian Evolver of this house
  106,4,"Who provides them with food against hunger, and with security against fear of danger"
  107,1,Do you see the one who denies the Judgment
  107,2,They are those who repulse the orphan
  107,3,And do not encourage the feeding of the indigent
  107,4,So woe to the worshippers
  107,5,Who are neglectful of their prayers
  107,6,Those who want to be seen
  107,7,But refuse to do even neighborly deeds
  108,1,"To you, We have granted the fountain of abundance"
  108,2,Therefore turn in prayer and sacrifice to your Lord
  108,3,"For he who hates you, he will be cut off"
