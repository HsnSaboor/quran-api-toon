quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  76,26,"And part of the night, prostrate yourself to Him, and praise Him throughout the night"
  76,27,"As for these, they love the fleeting life, and put away behind them a trying day"
  76,28,"It is We who created them, and We have made their forms strong, but when We will, We can substitute the like of them with a change"
  76,29,"This is advice, whosoever wills, let him take a path to his Lord"
  76,30,"But you cannot, except as God wills, and God is full of Knowledge and Wisdom"
  76,31,"He will admit to His mercy whom He wills, but the wrongdoers, for them has He prepared a terrible penalty"
  77,1,By those sent forth one after another
  77,2,That blow violently in tempestuous gusts
  77,3,And scatter far and wide
  77,4,"Then separate them, one from another"
  77,5,Then spread abroad a message
  77,6,Whether of justification or of warning
  77,7,Surely what you are promised must come to pass
  77,8,Then when the stars become dim
  77,9,When the heaven is cleft asunder
  77,10,When the mountains are scattered as dust
  77,11,And when the messengers are all appointed a time
  77,12,For what day are these deferred
  77,13,For the day of sorting out
  77,14,And what will explain to you what the day of sorting out is
  77,15,Ah woe that day to the rejecters of truth
  77,16,Did We not destroy people in the past
  77,17,So We will make those of late follow them
  77,18,This is how We deal with the people of sin
  77,19,Ah woe that day to the rejecters of truth
