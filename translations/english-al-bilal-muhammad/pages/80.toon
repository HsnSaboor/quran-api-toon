quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,15,"If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, take the evidence of four witnesses from among you against them. And if they testify, confine them to houses until death claims them or God ordains for them some other way"
  4,16,"If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and change, leave them alone, for God is Oft-Returning, the Merciful Redeemer"
  4,17,"God accepts the repentance of those who do wrong in ignorance and repent soon afterward. To them God will turn in mercy, for God is full of knowledge and wisdom"
  4,18,"Of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do wrong until death faces one of them and he says, “Now have I repented indeed. Nor of those who die rejecting faith. For them We have prepared a punishment most terrible"
  4,19,"O you who believe, you are forbidden to marry women against their will, nor should you treat them with harshness by taking away part of the dowry you have given them, except when they have been guilty of open lewdness. Instead, live with them in kindness. If you take a disliking to them, it may be that you dislike something with which God brings a great deal of good"
