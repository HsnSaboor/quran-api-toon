quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,78,"He said, “This has been given to me because of what I know.” Did he not know that God had caused to perish before him, entire generations which were superior to him in strength and greater in the riches they had accumulated? But the wrong-doers are not called immediately to account for their sins"
  28,79,"So he went to his people with the pride of his worldly glitter. Said those whose goal is the life of the present, “Oh I wish we had the like of what Qarun has, he is truly a master of good fortune.”"
  28,80,"But those who had been granted true knowledge said, “Unfortunately for you, the reward of God in the hereafter is best for those who believe and work righteousness, but none will attain this, except those who persevere in good.”"
  28,81,"Then We caused the earth to swallow him up, and his house, and he had not the least little group to help him against God, nor could he defend himself"
  28,82,"And those who had envied his position the day before began to say, “It is indeed God Who enlarges the provisions or restricts them for any of His servants He pleases. Had it not been that God was gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up. Indeed those who reject God will never prosper.”"
  28,83,"The home of the hereafter, We will give it to those who do not intend haughtiness or wrong on earth, and the end is best for the righteous"
  28,84,"If any does right, the reward for him is better than his deed, but if any does wrong, the doers of wrong are only punished to the extent of what they do"
