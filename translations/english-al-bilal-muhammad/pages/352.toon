quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  24,21,"O you who believe, follow not Satan’s footsteps. If any follow the footsteps of Satan, he will command what is shameful and wrong, and were it not for the grace and mercy of God on you, not one of you would have ever been purified, but God purifies whom He pleases, and God is the One who hears and knows all things"
  24,22,"Let not those among you who are endued with grace and means, resolve by promise against helping their relatives, those in want, and those who have left their homes in God's cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that God would forgive you? For God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming"
  24,23,"Those who slander chaste women, indiscreet but believing, are cursed in this life and in the hereafter, for them is a terrible penalty"
  24,24,"On the day when their tongues, their hands, and their feet will bear witness against them as to their actions"
  24,25,"On that day, God will pay them back all that is due, and they will realize that God is the Truth, He Who makes all things manifest"
  24,26,"Unethical women are for unethical men, and immoral men are for immoral women. And refined women are for refined men, and refined men are for refined women. These are not affected by what people say, for them there is forgiveness and an honorable reward"
  24,27,"O you who believe, enter not houses other than your own, until you have asked permission and greeted those in them. That is best for you, and perhaps you will apply it"
