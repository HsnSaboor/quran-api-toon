quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Your Lord knows that you rise nearly two-thirds of the night, or half the night, or a third of the night, and so does a group of those with you. But God appoints night and day in due measure, He knows that you are unable to keep count of it. So He has turned to you. Therefore read of the Quran as much as is easy for you. He knows that there may be some among you in ill-health, others traveling through the land, seeking God's bounty, and others fighting in God's cause. Therefore read as much of the Quran as is easy, and establish prayer and give zakat, and loan to God a handsome loan, and whatever good you send forth for your souls, you will find it in God's presence. Yes, better and greater in reward. And seek the grace of God, for God is Oft-Forgiving, Redeeming"
  74,1,O you wrapped up
  74,2,Arise and deliver your warning
  74,3,And praise your Lord
  74,4,"And your garments, keep free from stain"
  74,5,And avoid all abomination
  74,6,"Nor expect from giving, any increase"
  74,7,"But for your Lord’s sake, be patient and constant"
  74,8,"Finally, when the trumpet is sounded"
  74,9,"That day, will be a day of distress"
  74,10,Far from easy for those without faith
  74,11,Leave Me alone with those that I created alone
  74,12,To whom I granted resources in abundance
  74,13,And children to be by his side
  74,14,To whom I made life smooth and comfortable
  74,15,Yet he is greedy. Should I add even more
  74,16,"By no mean, because to Our signs he has been rebellious"
  74,17,Soon I will visit him with a mount of disasters
