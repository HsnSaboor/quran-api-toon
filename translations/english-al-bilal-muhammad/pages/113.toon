  5,32,"On that account, We ordained for the Children of Israel, that if anyone slew a person, unless it is for murder or for spreading devilry in the land, it would be as if he slew a whole people, and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of a whole people. Then, although there came to them Our messengers with clear signs, even after that, many of them continued to commit atrocities in the land"
  5,33,"The punishment of those who wage war against God and His messenger, and commit crimes through the land, is execution, crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land. That is their disgrace in the present, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the hereafter"
  5,34,"Except for those who repent before they fall to your power. In that case, know that God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming"
  5,35,"O you who believe, do your duty to God, seek the way to Him, and strive in his cause, that you may flourish"
  5,36,"As for those who do not believe, if they had everything on earth, and twice repeated to ransom themselves with it from the penalty on the Day of Accountability, it would never be accepted of them, for them is a terrible penalty"
