  34,32,"The arrogant ones will say to those who had been oppressed, “Was it we who kept you back from guidance after it reached you? No, rather it was you who transgressed.”"
  34,33,"Those who had been oppressed will say to the arrogant ones, “No, it was a plot of yours by day and by night. Behold, you constantly ordered us to be ungrateful to God, and to attribute equals to Him.” They will declare repentance when they see the penalty. We will put chains on the necks of the unbelievers. It would only be punishment for their deeds"
  34,34,"Never did We send a warner to a population but the elites among them said, “We do not believe in the message with which you have been sent.”"

  34,36,"Say, “Indeed my Lord enlarges and restricts the provision to whom He pleases, but most people do not understand.”"
