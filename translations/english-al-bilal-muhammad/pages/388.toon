  28,22,"Then when he turned his face towards the land of Madyan he said, “I hope that my Lord will show me the smooth path.”"
  28,23,"And when he arrived at the watering-place in Madyan, he found there a group of men watering their flocks, and besides them he found two ladies who were keeping back their flocks. He said, “What is the problem?” They said, “We cannot water our flocks until the shepherds move their flocks, for our father is a very old man.”"
  28,24,"So he watered their flocks for them, then he went back to the shade and said, \"O my Lord, indeed I am in desperate need of any good that You can send me.”"
  28,25,"Afterward, one of the damsels came back to him walking shyly. She said, “My father invites you that he may reward you for having watered our flocks for us.” So when he came to him and told the story he said, “Fear not, you escaped from people of wrongdoing.”"
  28,26,"Said one of them, “O my father, hire him, truly the best of people for you to employ is one of integrity.”"
  28,27,"He said, “I intend to wed one of my daughters to you on condition that you work for me for eight years, but if you complete ten years, it will be a favor from you, but I intend not to place you under any difficulty. Indeed you will find me, God willing, one of the righteous.”"
  28,28,"He said, “Let there be an agreement between you and me, that whichever of the two terms I fulfill let there be no resentment toward me, and God is a witness to what we say.”"
