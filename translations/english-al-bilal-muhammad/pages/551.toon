  60,12,"O messenger, when believing women come to you, and promise that they will not associate in worship any other thing with God, that they will not steal, that they will not have impermissible sex, that they will not kill their children, that they will not commit slander to intentionally misrepresent and deceive, and that they will not ignore you in what they know to be right, then take their word, and pray to God for their forgiveness, for God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming"
