quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  48,24,"And it is He Who has restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in Mecca, after He gave you the victory over them, and God sees well all that you do"
  48,25,"They are the ones who denied revelation and hindered you from the Sacred Masjid and the sacrificial animals which they kept from reaching their place of sacrifice. Had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not know you were trampling, and on whose account a crime would have come to you without your knowledge, God would have allowed you to force your way. But He held back your hands, so that He may admit to His mercy those whom He wills. If they had been apart, We would certainly have punished the unbelievers among them with a terrible punishment"
  48,26,"While the unbelievers had in their hearts distain, distain of ignorance, God sent down His tranquility to His messenger and to the believers, and made them adhere to the command of self-restraint, and they were well entitled to it and worthy of it, and God has full knowledge of all things"
  48,27,"Truly God fulfilled this vision for His messenger, you will enter the Sacred Masjid, if God wills, with minds secure, heads shaved or cut, and without fear. And He knew what you did not, and He granted in addition to this, a speedy victory"
  48,28,"It is He Who has sent His messenger with guidance and a true way of life, to proclaim over all other ways of life, and enough is God for a witness"
