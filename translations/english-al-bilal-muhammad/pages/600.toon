quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,And that which is in the chest is made manifest
  100,11,That their Guardian Evolver had been well acquainted with them that day
  101,1,The Disaster
  101,2,What is the Disaster
  101,3,And what will explain to you what the Disaster is
  101,4,It is a day when humanity will be like scattered moths
  101,5,And the mountains will be as wool
  101,6,Then he whose scales will be heavy
  101,7,Will be in a life of blessings and satisfaction
  101,8,But he whose scale will be found light
  101,9,Will have his home in a pit
  101,10,And what will explain to you what this is
  101,11,It is a fire blazing fiercely
  102,1,The competition for accumulating diverts you
  102,2,Until you all visit the graves
  102,3,"But no, you will soon know"
  102,4,"Again, you will soon know"
  102,5,"No, were you to know with certainty of mind"
  102,6,You will certainly see hellfire
  102,7,"Again, you will see it with certainty of sight"
  102,8,"Then, you will be questioned that day about the pleasure you indulged in"
