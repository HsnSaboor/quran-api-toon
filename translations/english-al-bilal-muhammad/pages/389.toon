quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,29,"So when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was traveling with his family, he perceived a fire in the direction of Mount Tur. He said to his family, “Wait, I perceive a fire. I hope to bring you some knowledge from there, or a torch, that you may warm yourselves.”"
  28,30,"But when he came to the fire, a voice was heard from the right bank of the valley, from a tree in hallowed ground, “O Moses, indeed I am God, Lord of all the worlds"
  28,31,"“Now throw your staff.” But when he saw it moving of its own accord, as if it had been a snake, he turned back in retreat, and would not immediately return. “O Moses,” it was said, “Come close, and fear not, for you are of those who are secure"
  28,32,"“Put your hand in your chest and it will come out white without harm, and draw your hand close to your side to guard against fear. Those are two pieces of evidence from your Lord to Pharaoh and his advisors, for truly they are people rebellious and wicked.”"
  28,33,"He said, “O my Lord, I have slain a person among them, so I fear they will try to slay me"
  28,34,"“And my brother Aaron, he is more eloquent in speech than I, so send him with me as a helper, to edify and strengthen me, for I fear that they may accuse me of falsehood.”"
  28,35,"He said, “We will certainly strengthen your arm through your brother, and invest you both with authority, so they will not be able to touch you. With Our sign you will triumph, you two as well as those who follow you.”"
