quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,62,"To you they swear by God, in order to please you. But it is more fitting that they should please God and His messenger, if they are believers"
  9,63,Do they not know that for those who oppose God and His messenger is the fire of hell where they will dwell forever? That is the terrible disgrace
  9,64,"The hypocrites are afraid that a Surah will be sent down about them, revealing what is in their heart. Say, “You mock, but indeed God will bring to light all that you fear.”"
  9,65,"If you question them they declare, “We were only talking, we were playing.” Say, “Was it God, His signs, and His messenger which you were mocking?”"
  9,66,"Make you no excuses. You have rejected faith after you had accepted it. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others among you, because they are wrongdoers"
  9,67,"The hypocrites, men and women, are with each other. They encourage evil and forbid what is just, and close their hands. They have forgotten God, so He has forgotten them. Indeed the hypocrites are rebellious"
  9,68,"God has promised the hypocrites, men and women, and the rejecters of faith, the fire of hell. Therein will they dwell. Appropriate is it for them. For them is the curse of God and an enduring punishment"
