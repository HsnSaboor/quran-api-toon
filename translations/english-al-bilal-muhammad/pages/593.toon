quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the dawn
  89,2,By the ten nights
  89,3,By the even and odd
  89,4,And by the night when it passes away
  89,5,Is there not in these an oath for those who understand
  89,6,Do you not see how your Lord dealt with the ‘Ad
  89,7,"Of Iram, with lofty pillars"
  89,8,The like of which were not produced in all the land
  89,9,"And with the Thamud, who carved out rocks in the valley"
  89,10,"And with Pharaoh, lord of stakes"
  89,11,All of these transgressed beyond bounds in the lands
  89,12,And spread corruption therein
  89,13,Therefore your Lord poured on them a scourge of diverse chastisements
  89,14,For your Lord is on a watchtower
  89,15,"Now, as for humanity, when their Lord tries them, giving them honor and gifts, they then say, “My Lord has honored me.”"
  89,16,"But when He tries them, restricting subsistence from them, he says then, “My Lord has humiliated me.”"
  89,17,"But no, you do not honor the orphans"
  89,18,Nor do you encourage one another to feed the poor
  89,19,"And you devour inheritance, all with greed"
  89,20,And you love wealth with inordinate love
  89,21,"No, when the earth is pounded to powder"
  89,22,"And your Lord comes, and His angels, rank upon rank"
  89,23,"And hell, that day, is brought forth, on that day will the human being remember, but how will that remembrance profit him"
