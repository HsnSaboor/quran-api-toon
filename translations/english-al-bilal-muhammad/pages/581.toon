quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Have We not created you from a fluid seemingly worthless
  77,21,"Which We placed in a place of rest, firmly fixed"
  77,22,For a period determined
  77,23,"And We decide, for We are the best to decide"
  77,24,Ah woe that day to the rejecters of truth
  77,25,Have We not made the earth to draw together–
  77,26,The living and the dead
  77,27,"And made therein mountains standing firm and lofty, and provided for you sweet water"
  77,28,Ah woe that day to the rejecters of truth
  77,29,It will be said “Go to that which you used to reject as false
  77,30,“Depart to a shadow in three columns
  77,31,"“Which yields no shade of coolness, and is of no use against the fierce blaze.”"
  77,32,“Indeed it throws about sparks as forts
  77,33,“As if there were yellow camels.”
  77,34,Ah woe that day to the rejecters of truth
  77,35,That will be a day when they will be unable to speak
  77,36,Nor will it be open to them to put forth pleas
  77,37,Ah woe that day to the rejecters of truth
  77,38,That will be a day of sorting out. We will gather you together with those before you
  77,39,"Now, if you have a plot, use it against Me"
  77,40,Ah woe that day to the rejecters of truth
  77,41,"As for the righteous, they will be amid shade and springs"
  77,42,"And fruits, all they desire"
  77,43,"“Eat and drink to your heart’s content, for all that you did"
  77,44,We certainly reward the doers of good
  77,45,Ah woe that day to the rejecters of truth
  77,46,"Eat and enjoy yourselves a little while, because you are wrong-doers"
  77,47,Ah woe that day to the rejecters of truth
  77,48,"And when it is said to them, “Prostrate yourselves,” they do not do so"
  77,49,Ah woe that day to the rejecters of truth
  77,50,Then in what message after that will they believe? 50 (End of Part)
