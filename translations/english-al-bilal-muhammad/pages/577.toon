quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,Then will no intercession of intercessors profit them
  74,49,Then what is the matter with them that they turn away from advice
  74,50,As if they were affrighted animals
  74,51,Fleeing from a lion
  74,52,Still each one of them wants to be given scrolls spread out
  74,53,"By no means, but they are not conscious of the hereafter"
  74,54,"No, indeed it is a reminder"
  74,55,Let any who wills keep it in remembrance
  74,56,"But none will keep it in remembrance except as God wills. He is the Lord of righteousness, and the Lord of forgiveness"
  75,1,I call to witness the day of resurrection
  75,2,And I call to witness the self-accusing soul
  75,3,Does the human being think that We cannot assemble his bones
  75,4,"Indeed We are able to put together in perfect order, the very tips of their fingers"
  75,5,But the human being wishes to do wrong in the time in front of him
  75,6,"He questions, “When is the Day of Resurrection?”"
  75,7,"Then, when the sight is dazed"
  75,8,And the Moon is buried in darkness
  75,9,And the Sun and Moon are synchronized
  75,10,"That day the human being will say, “Where is the refuge?”"
  75,11,By no means is it a place of safety
  75,12,Before your Lord that day will be the place of rest
  75,13,"That day the human being will be told all that he pushed forward, and all that he keep back"
  75,14,"No, the human being will be evidence against himself"
  75,15,Even though he were to put forth his excuses
  75,16,Move not your tongue to hasten it
  75,17,It is for Us to collect it and to recite it
  75,18,"But when We have recited it, follow its recital"
  75,19,And indeed it is upon Us to explain it
