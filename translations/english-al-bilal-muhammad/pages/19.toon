quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,120,"Never will Jews or Christians be satisfied with you unless you follow their way. Say, “The way of God, that is the only way.” If you followed their desires after the knowledge has reached you, then you would find neither protector nor helper"
  2,121,"Those to whom We have sent the Book, read it as it should be read, they are the ones who believe. Those who do not believe, the loss is their own"
  2,122,"O Children of Israel, call to mind the favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you to all others"
  2,123,"So guard yourselves against a day when no soul will avail another, nor will compensation be accepted from her, nor will intercession profit her, nor will anyone be helped"
  2,124,"And remember that Abraham was tried by his Lord with certain commands which he fulfilled. He said, “I will make you a leader of the nations.” He pleaded, “And also from my offspring.” He answered, “But My promise is not within reach of the wrongdoers.”"
  2,125,"Remember We made the House a place of assembly for humanity and a place of safety. And take the station of Abraham as a place of prayer. And We made a covenant with Abraham and Ishmael, that they should redeem My house for those who circle it, or use it as a retreat, or bow, or prostrate themselves"
  2,126,"And remember Abraham said, “My Lord, make this a city of peace, and feed its people with fruit, those of them who believe in God and the Last Day.” He said, “And those who do not believe, I will grant them their pleasure for a while, but will soon drive them to the torment of the fire, a miserable destination indeed.”"
