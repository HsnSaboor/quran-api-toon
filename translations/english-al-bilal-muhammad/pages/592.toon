quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,"No, you prefer the life of the present"
  87,17,But the hereafter is better and longer lasting
  87,18,And this is in the Ancient Books
  87,19,The Books of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Has the story reached you of the overwhelming event
  88,2,Some faces that day will be humiliated
  88,3,Laboring hard
  88,4,While they are entering the blazing fire
  88,5,"While they are given drink, from a boiling hot spring"
  88,6,No food will there be for them but a bitter Dhari’
  88,7,That will neither nourish nor satisfy hunger
  88,8,Faces that day will be joyful
  88,9,Pleased with their striving
  88,10,In a garden on high
  88,11,Where they will hear no vanity
  88,12,There will be a bubbling spring
  88,13,There will be thrones raised on high
  88,14,Goblets placed
  88,15,And cushions set in rows
  88,16,And rich carpets spread out
  88,17,"Do they not look at the camels, how they are made"
  88,18,"And at the sky, how it is raised high"
  88,19,"And at the mountains, how they are firmly fixed"
  88,20,"And at the earth, how it is spread out"
  88,21,"Therefore give advice, for you are one to advise"
  88,22,You are not one to manage their affairs
  88,23,But if any turn away and reject God
  88,24,God will punish him with a mighty punishment
  88,25,To Us will be their return
  88,26,Then it will be for Us to call them to account
