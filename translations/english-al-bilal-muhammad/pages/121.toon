quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,77,"Say, “O people of the Book, do not go to extremes in your religions, other than in truth. Nor follow the vain desires of people who went wrong in times gone by, who misled many and strayed from the balanced way.”"
  5,78,"Condemnation was pronounced on those among the Children of Israel who rejected faith, by the tongue of David and of Jesus the son of Mary, because they did not follow them and persisted in excesses"
  5,79,Nor did they discourage one another the immorality which they committed. Wrong indeed were the things they did
  5,80,"You see many of them turning in friendship to the unbelievers. Wrong indeed is that which their souls have sent forward before them. God's punishment is on them, and they will live in torment"
  5,81,"If only they had believed in God, in the messenger, and in what is revealed to him, never would they have taken them for friends and protectors, but many of them are rebellious wrongdoers"
  5,82,"Strongest among people in opposition to the believers will you find among the Jews and pagans. And alongside those believers in devotion will you find those who say, “We are Christians,” because among these are those devoted to learning and those who are in service to humanity, and they are not arrogant. 82 (End of Part)"
