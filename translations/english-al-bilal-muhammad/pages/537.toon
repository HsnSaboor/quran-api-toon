quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,That this is indeed a Quran most honorable
  56,78,In a book well guarded
  56,79,Which none will touch but those who are clean
  56,80,A revelation from the Guardian Evolver of all the systems of knowledge
  56,81,Is it such a message that you would hold in light esteem
  56,82,And have you made it your life to declare it false
  56,83,Then why do you not intervene when the soul reaches the throat
  56,84,But you just stand there looking on
  56,85,"But We are nearer to him than you, but you see not"
  56,86,"Then why do you not, if you are exempt from account"
  56,87,"Call back the soul, if you are truthful"
  56,88,Then if he is of those nearest to God
  56,89,"There is for him rest and satisfaction, and a garden of pleasure"
  56,90,And if he is of the companions of the right hand
  56,91,"Then for him is the salutation, “Peace be unto you,” from the companions of the right hand"
  56,92,"And if he is of those who treat truth as false, and who go wrong"
  56,93,For him is entertainment with boiling water
  56,94,And burning in hellfire
  56,95,"Indeed, this is the truth with certainty"
  56,96,"So glorify with praises the name of your Lord, the Supreme"
  57,1,"That which is in the heavens and on earth, let it declare the praises and glory of God, for He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise"
  57,2,"To Him belongs the control of the heavens and the earth. It is He Who gives life and death, and He has power over all things"
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last, the Evident and the Hidden, and He has full knowledge of all things"
