quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"“Who used to say, ‘What, are you among those who bear witness to the truth"
  37,53,"“When we die and become dust and bones, will we indeed receive rewards and punishments?”"
  37,54,"A voice said, “Would you like to look down?”"
  37,55,He looked down and saw him in the middle of the fire
  37,56,"He said, “By God, you were just short of bringing me to perdition"
  37,57,"“Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those sent there"
  37,58,“Is it the case that we will not die
  37,59,"“Except our first death, and that we will not be punished?”"
  37,60,Indeed this is the greatest achievement
  37,61,For the like of this let all strive who wish to strive
  37,62,Is that the better entertainment or the Tree of Zaqqum
  37,63,For We have truly made it a trial for the wrongdoers
  37,64,For it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of hellfire
  37,65,The shoots of its fruit-stalks are like the heads of devils
  37,66,Truly they will eat of it and fill their stomachs
  37,67,Then indeed on top of that they will be given a mixture made of boiling water
  37,68,Then their return will be to the fire
  37,69,Truly they found their parents on the wrong path
  37,70,So they were rushed down on their footsteps
  37,71,"And truly before them, many of the ancients went astray"
  37,72,"But We sent among them, people to advise them"
  37,73,Then see what was the end of those who were advised
  37,74,Except the sincere servants of God
  37,75,"Noah called to Us, and We are the best to hear prayers"
  37,76,And We delivered him and his people from the Great Calamity
