quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,71,"They thought there would be no trial or punishment, so they became blind and deaf. Still God turned to them, but again, many of them became blind and deaf, but God sees well all that they do"
  5,72,"They do blaspheme who say, “God is Christ the son of Mary.” But what Christ said was, “O Children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord.” Whoever joins other gods with God, He will forbid him the garden, and the fire will be his abode. For the wrongdoers there will be no one to help"
  5,73,"They do blaspheme who say, “God is one of three in a trinity,” for there is no god except the one God. If they do not desist from these words, indeed a terrible penalty will befall the blasphemers among them"
  5,74,"Why do they not turn to God and seek His forgiveness? For God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming"
  5,75,"Christ the son of Mary was no more than a messenger. Many were the messengers who passed away before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They both had to eat their food. See how God makes His signs clear to them, yet see in what ways they are deluded away from the truth"
  5,76,"Say, “Will you worship besides God something that has power neither to harm nor benefit you? But God, He hears and knows all things.”"
