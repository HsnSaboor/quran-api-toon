quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,187,"Encouraged for you on the night of the fast is sexual relations with your wives. They are garments for you and you are garments for them. God knows what you used to do secretly among yourselves, but He turned to you and forgave you. So associate with them now, and seek what God has ordained for you. And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn appears to you distinct from its black thread. Then continue to fast until night. But do not be intimate with your wives while you are in retreat in the masjid. Those are limits set by God, do not come near it. God makes clear His signs to humanity, that they may become realized"
  2,188,"And do not consume your property among yourselves in vanity, nor use it as bribes for the judges, with intent that you may consume wrongfully and knowingly, a little of other people’s property"
  2,189,"They ask you concerning the new moons. Say, “They are signs to mark fixed periods of time for humanity, including the Hajj.” It is not righteous to enter your houses from the back. But it is righteous to be one who is conscious of God, and to enter houses through there proper doors, and to be aware of God, that you may flourish"
  2,190,"Fight in the cause of God, those who fight you, but do not transgress limits, for God does not love transgressors"
