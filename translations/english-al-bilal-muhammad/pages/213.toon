quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"Say, “Of your partners, can any originate creation and repeat it?” Say, “It is God Who originates creation and repeats it. So how are you deluded?”"
  10,35,"Say, “Of your partners, are there any that can give any guidance towards truth?” Say, “It is God Who gives guidance towards truth. Then is He Who gives guidance to truth more worthy to be followed, or he who finds no guidance unless he is guided? What then is the matter with you, and oh how you judge?”"
  10,36,"But most of them follow nothing but their desire, and truly desire can be of no avail against truth. Indeed God is well aware of all that they do"
  10,37,"This Quran could not be produced by any other than God. It is a reflection of the truth that came before it, and an explanation of the Bible, it is no doubt from the Guardian Evolver of all the systems of knowledge"
  10,38,"Or do they say, “He fabricated it?” Say, “Well, bring a Surah like it, and call anyone you can, besides God, if you speak the truth.”"
  10,39,"No, they charge with falsehood him whose knowledge they cannot encompass, even before the understanding of it has reached them. And those before them made similar charges of falsehood. Then consider what the end of those who did wrong was"
  10,40,"Of them, there are some who believe in it, and some who do not, and your Lord knows best those who are out to do wrong"
  10,41,"If they charge you with falsehood say, “My deeds to me, and yours to you. You are free from responsibility for what I do, and I for what you do.”"
  10,42,"Among them are some who hear you, but can you cause the deaf to hear when they are without understanding"
