quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,On thrones they will observe
  83,36,Will the unbelievers not have been paid back for what they did
  84,1,When the universe is ripped apart
  84,2,"And it listens to its Guardian Evolver, as it must"
  84,3,And when the earth is flattened out
  84,4,And casts up what is within it and becomes empty
  84,5,"And listens to its Lord, as it must"
  84,6,"O human beings, indeed you are toiling on towards your Lord, ever toiling, but you will meet Him"
  84,7,Then he who is given his record in his right hand
  84,8,Soon his account will be taken by an easy reckoning
  84,9,And he will turn to his people rejoicing
  84,10,But he who is given his record behind his back
  84,11,Soon he will cry for perdition
  84,12,And he will enter a blazing fire
  84,13,"Indeed he went about among his people, rejoicing"
  84,14,Indeed he thought that he would not have to return to Us
  84,15,"No, no, for his Lord was watchful of him"
  84,16,So I call to witness the ruddy glow of sunset
  84,17,The night and its homing
  84,18,And the moon in its fullness
  84,19,You will surely travel from stage to stage
  84,20,What then is the matter with them that they do not believe
  84,21,"And when the Quran is read to them, they do not fall prostrate"
  84,22,But instead the unbelievers reject it
  84,23,But God has full knowledge of what they hide
  84,24,So announce to them a terrible penalty
  84,25,"Except to those who believe and do righteous deeds, for them is a reward that will never fail"
