quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,Concerning what they are disputing
  78,2,Concerning the great announcement
  78,3,About which they cannot agree
  78,4,Indeed they will soon come to know
  78,5,"Again, indeed they will soon come to know"
  78,6,Have We not made the earth as a wide expanse
  78,7,And the mountains as pegs
  78,8,And created you mates
  78,9,And made your sleep for rest
  78,10,And made the night as a covering
  78,11,And made the day as a means of subsistence
  78,12,And built over you the seven firmaments
  78,13,And placed a light of splendor
  78,14,And do We not send down from the clouds water in abundance
  78,15,That We may produce with it grains and vegetables
  78,16,And gardens of luxurious growth
  78,17,Indeed the day of sorting out is a thing appointed
  78,18,"The day the trumpet will be sounded, and you will come forth in crowds"
  78,19,And the heavens will be opened as if there were doors
  78,20,"And the mountains will vanish, as if they were a mirage"
  78,21,Truly hell is a place of ambush
  78,22,For the transgressors a place of destination
  78,23,They will dwell therein for ages
  78,24,"Nothing cool will they taste therein, nor any drink"
  78,25,"Except a boiling fluid, and a fluid dark, murky, intensely cold"
  78,26,A fitting reward
  78,27,Because they feared not any account for their deeds
  78,28,And they treated Our signs as false
  78,29,All things have We preserved on record
  78,30,"So taste this, for no increase will We grant you, except in punishment"
