  37,26,"No, but that day they will submit"
  37,27,"And they will turn to one another, and question each other"
  37,28,"They will say, “It was you who used to come to us from the right.”"
  37,29,"They will reply, “No, you yourselves had no faith"
  37,30,"“Nor had we any authority over you. No, it was you who were a people in obstinate rebellion"
  37,31,"“So now has been proved true against us, the word of our Lord, so we will indeed taste it"
  37,32,"“We led you astray, for indeed we were ourselves astray.”"
  37,33,"Indeed that day, they will all share in the penalty"
  37,34,Indeed that is how We will deal with the wrong-doers
  37,35,"For they, when they were told that there is no god except God, would puff themselves up with pride–"

  37,44,Facing each other on thrones
  37,45,Round will be passed to them a cup from a clear-flowing fountain
  37,46,"White, of a taste delicious to those who drink of it"
  37,47,"Free from harm, nor will they suffer intoxication from it"
  37,48,And with them will be companions of modest gaze and beautiful eyes
  37,49,Like delicate eggs closely guarded
  37,50,Then they will turn to one another and question each other
  37,51,"One of them will start the conversation by saying, “I had a friend"
