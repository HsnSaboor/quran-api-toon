quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,59,"And We refrain from sending the signs only because the people of previous generations treated them as false. We sent the she-camel to the Thamud to open their eyes, but they treated it wrongfully. We only send the signs as a warning"
  17,60,"And when We told you that your Lord encompasses humanity, We granted the vision which We showed you as a trial for humanity, and the Cursed Tree in the Quran. We put fear into them, but it only increases their transgression"
  17,61,"Behold, We said to the angels, “Bow down to Adam.” They all bowed down, except Lucifer. He said, “Shall I bow down to one whom You created from mud?”"
  17,62,"He said, “See this one whom You have honored above me? If You give me respite until the Day of Accountability, I will surely bring his descendants under my sway, all but a few.”"
  17,63,"God said, “Go your way, if any of them follow you, indeed hell will be the reward of you all, a sufficient reward"
  17,64,"“Lead to destruction with your voice, those among them whom you can, make assaults on them with your cavalry and your infantry, share with them in their wealth and children, and make promises to them.” But Satan promises them nothing but deceit"
  17,65,"“As for My servants, no authority will you have over them.” Enough is your Lord for a manager of affairs"
  17,66,"Your Lord is He Who makes the ship sail smoothly for you through the sea, in order that you may seek of His bounty, for He is to you the Merciful Redeemer"
