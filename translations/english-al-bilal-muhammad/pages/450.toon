  37,104,"We called out to him “O Abraham,”"
  37,105,“You have already fulfilled the vision.” Indeed We reward those who do right
  37,106,For this was a challenge
  37,107,And We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice
  37,108,And We left this blessing for him among generations to come
  37,109,“Peace and salutation to Abraham.”
  37,110,Indeed We reward those who do right

  37,118,And We guided them to the straight way
  37,119,And We left this blessing for them among generations to come
  37,120,“Peace and salutation to Moses and Aaron.”
  37,121,So indeed We reward those who do right
  37,122,For they were two of our believing servants
