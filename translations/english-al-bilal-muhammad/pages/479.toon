quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  41,21,"They will say to their skin, “Why do you bear witness against us?” They will say, “God has given us speech, He Who gives speech to everything. He created you for the first time, and to Him were you to return"
  41,22,"“You did not seek to protect yourselves, so that your hearing, your sight, and your skin would not bear witness against you. But you thought that God did not know many of the things you used to do"
  41,23,"“But this thought of yours which you entertained concerning your Lord has brought you to destruction, and you became of those utterly lost.”"
  41,24,"Even if then they have patience, the fire will be a home for them, and if they beg for favor, favor they will not receive"
  41,25,"And We have destined for them close companions, who made alluring to them that which was before them and behind them, and the accusation among the previous generations of jinn and humans who have passed away is proven against them, for they are utterly lost"
  41,26,"The unbelievers say, “Do not listen to this Quran, but talk at random in the middle of its reading, that you may gain the upper hand.”"
  41,27,"But We will certainly give the unbelievers a taste of a severe penalty, and We will charge them for the worst of their deeds"
  41,28,"Such is the punishment for the enemies of God. In the fire will be their eternal home, repayment because they used to reject Our signs"
  41,29,"And the unbelievers will say, “Our Lord, show us those among the jinn and humans who misled us. We will crush them beneath our feet, so that they become the lowest.”"
