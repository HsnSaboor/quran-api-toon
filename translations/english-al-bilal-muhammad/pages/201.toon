quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,87,"They prefer to be with those who remain behind. Their hearts are sealed, so they do not understand"
  9,88,"But the messenger, and those who believe with him, strive and fight with their wealth and their persons, for them are all good things, and they will flourish"
  9,89,"God has prepared for them gardens with rivers flowing through them, to dwell therein forever. That is the ultimate accomplishment"
  9,90,"And there were among the desert Arabs, those who made excuses and came to claim exemption. And those who lied to God and His messenger sat inactive. Soon a terrible penalty will seize the unbelievers among them"
  9,91,"There is no blame on those who are infirm or ill, or who find no resources to give. If they are sincere to God and His messenger, no ground of complaint can there be against those who do right, and God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming"
  9,92,"Nor on those who came to you to be provided with mounts and when you said, “I can find no mounts for you,” they eventually left, their eyes streaming with tears of grief, because they could not find the resources"
  9,93,"The grounds of complaint are against those who claim exemption while they are rich. They prefer to stay with those who remain behind. God sealed their hearts, but they knew not. 93 (End of Part)"
