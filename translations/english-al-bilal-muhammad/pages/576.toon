  74,18,For he thought and he plotted
  74,19,"Oh, how he plotted"
  74,20,"Yes, woe to him, how he plotted"
  74,21,Then he looked around
  74,22,Then he frowned and he scowled
  74,23,Then he turned back and was arrogant

  74,26,Soon I will cast him into hellfire
  74,27,And what will explain to you what hellfire is
  74,28,"Nothing does it permit to endure, and nothing does it leave alone"
  74,29,Darkening and changing the color of human beings
  74,30,Over it are nineteen
  74,31,"And We have set none other than angels as guardians of the fire. And We have fixed their number only as a challenge for unbelievers, in order that the people of the Book may arrive at certainty, and the believers may increase in faith, and that no doubts may be left for the people of the Book and the believers, and that those in whose hearts is a disease, and the unbelievers may say, “What meaning does God intend by this?” So God leaves to stray whom He pleases, and guides whom He pleases, and none can know the forces of your Lord except Him.

  74,32,"No, indeed by the Moon"
  74,33,And by the night as it retreats
  74,34,And by the dawn as it shines forth
  74,35,Indeed it is one of the greatest

  74,41,Those who were corrupt
  74,42,“What led you into hellfire?”
  74,43,"They will say, “We were not of those who prayed"
  74,44,“Nor were we of those who fed the indigent
  74,45,“But we used to speak vainly with vain people
  74,46,“And we used to deny the Day of Accountability
  74,47,“Until there came to us that which is certain.”
