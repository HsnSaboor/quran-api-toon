quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  7,156,"“And ordain for us that which is good, in this life and in the hereafter, for we have turned to You.” He said, “With My punishment I visit whom I will, but My mercy extends to all things, and I will ordain My mercy for those who do right, and give zakat, and those who believe in Our signs"
  7,157,"“Those who follow the messenger, the prophet of mother wit, who they find mentioned in their own scriptures, in the Torah and the gospel. For he commands them what is just and forbids them what is unjust, he encourages for them as permissible that which is good, and prohibits them from what is harmful. He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the chains that are upon them. So it is those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which is sent down to him, it is these who will flourish.”"
  7,158,"Say, “O humanity, I am sent to you all as the messenger of God, to Whom belongs the control of the heavens and the earth. There is no god but He. It is He Who gives both life and death. So believe in God and His messenger, the prophet of mother wit, who believes in God and His words. Follow him that you may be guided.”"
  7,159,"Of the people of Moses, a group of them guides and does justice in the light of truth"
