  18,21,"Then We made their story known, that they would understand that the promise of God is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour of Accountability. Behold, they dispute among themselves as to their story. They said, “Construct a building over them.” Their Lord knows best concerning them. Those who would dispute over their affair said, “Let us at least build a place of worship over them.”"
  18,22,"Some will say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them, others say they were five, the dog being the sixth, doubtfully guessing at the unknown, still others say they were seven, the dog being the eighth. Say, “My Lord knows best their number, it is only a few others who know.” Therefore, do not enter into controversies concerning them, except on a matter that is clear, nor consult any of them about the Sleepers"
