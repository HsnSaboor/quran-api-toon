quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,43,"No people can hasten their term, nor can they delay it"
  23,44,Then We sent our messengers in succession. Every time there came to a people their messenger they accused him of falsehood. So We made them follow each other in punishment. We made them as a tale that is told. So away with a people who will not believe
  23,45,Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and with clear authority
  23,46,And to Pharaoh and his nomarchs. But they behaved arrogantly. They were a people conceited
  23,47,"They said, “Shall we believe in two people like ourselves while their people are subject to us?”"
  23,48,"So they accused them of falsehood, and they became of those that were caused to perish"
  23,49,"And We gave Moses the Book, in order that they might receive guidance"
  23,50,"And We made the son of Mary and his mother as a sign. We gave them both shelter on a high ground of tranquility, and springs"
  23,51,"O you messengers, enjoy things good and refined, and work righteousness, for I am well acquainted with all that you do"
  23,52,"And indeed this community of yours is a single community, and I am your Lord. Therefore fear Me and no other"
  23,53,But the people cut off the events of unity between them into sects. Each group rejoices in that which is with it
  23,54,But leave them in their confused ignorance for now
  23,55,Do they think that because We have granted them abundance of wealth and sons
  23,56,"That We would funnel them all the good. No, they do not understand"
  23,57,Indeed those who live in awe for fear of their Lord
  23,58,Those who believe in the signs of their Lord
  23,59,"Those who do not join in worship, partners with their Lord"
