quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and its splendor
  91,2,By the moon as it follows it
  91,3,By the day as it shows its glory
  91,4,By the night as it conceals it
  91,5,By the firmament and its structure
  91,6,By the earth and its expanse
  91,7,"By the soul, and the proportion and order given to it"
  91,8,And its enlightenment as to its difficulty and its consciousness
  91,9,Certainly she succeeds who purifies it
  91,10,And she fail who corrupts it
  91,11,The Thamud rejected through their inordinate wrongdoing
  91,12,"Behold, their representative was the most terrible person among them"
  91,13,"But the messenger of God said to them, “It is a she-camel of God, so let it have a drink.”"
  91,14,"Then they rejected him, and they hamstrung it. So their Lord, on account of their crime, obliterated their traces and leveled them"
  91,15,And for Him is no fear of its consequences
  92,1,By the night as it conceals
  92,2,By the day as it appears in glory
  92,3,By the creation of male and female
  92,4,"Indeed, what you strive for is diverse"
  92,5,So he who gives and is conscious of God
  92,6,And testifies to the best
  92,7,We will indeed make smooth for him the path to bliss
  92,8,But he who suffers from greed and thinks himself self-sufficient
  92,9,And denies the best
  92,10,We will indeed make smooth for him the path to misery
  92,11,Nor will his wealth profit him when he falls headlong
  92,12,Indeed We take upon Ourselves to guide
  92,13,And indeed to Us belong the end and the beginning
  92,14,Therefore I warn you of a fire blazing fiercely
