  22,40,"Those who have been expelled from their homes in defiance of right, for no reason except that they say, “Our Guardian Evolver is God.” If God did not check one group of people by means of another, there would surely have been pulled down monasteries, churches, synagogues, and masjids, in which the name of God is commemorated in abundant measure. God will certainly aid those who aid Him, for indeed God is Full of Strength, Exalted in Might"
  22,41,"Those who, if We establish them in the land, establish prayer and give zakat, encourage right and forbid wrong, then with God rests the end of all their affairs"

  22,45,"How many populations have We caused to perish which were given to wrongdoing which tumbled down on their roofs? And how many wells are lying idle and neglected, as well as castles lofty and well-built"
  22,46,"Do they not travel through the land, so that their hearts may learn wisdom, and their ears may learn to hear? Truly it is not their eyes that are blind, but the hearts in their breasts"
