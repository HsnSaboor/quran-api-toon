  6,125,"Those whom God wills to guide, He opens their heart to Al-Islam. Those whom He wills to leave straying, He makes their heart closed and constricted, as if they had to climb up to the skies. And God heaps punishment on those who refuse to believe"

  6,127,"For them will be a home of peace in the presence of their Lord. He will be their Friend, because they practiced righteousness"
  6,128,"One day He will gather them all together and say, “O you assembly of jinn, much did you take from humanity.” Their friends among humanity will say, “Our Guardian Evolver, we made profit from each other, but we reached our term which You appointed for us.” He will say, “The fire will be your dwelling-place, you will dwell there forever, except as God wills.” For your Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge"

  6,130,"“O you assembly of jinn and humans, did there not come to you messengers from among you, relating to you My signs, and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours?” They will say, “We bear witness against ourselves.” The life of the present deceived them. So against themselves will they bear witness that they rejected faith"
  6,131,"For this, your Lord would not destroy them for their wrongdoing, or the peoples’ houses, while their occupants were unwarned"
