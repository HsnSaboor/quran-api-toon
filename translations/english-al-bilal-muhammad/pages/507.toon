quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"Those who reject God and hinder people from the path of God, God will cause their deeds to be lost"
  47,2,"But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, and believe in the revelation sent down to Muhammad, because it is the truth from their Lord, He will remove from them their sins and improve their condition"
  47,3,"Because those who reject God follow vanities, while those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. So God sets out for humanity their lessons by similitude"
  47,4,"Therefore, when you meet the unbelievers in war, strike at their necks, then when you have thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond firmly. Afterwards is the time for either generosity or ransom, but not until the war lays down its burdens, but if it had been God's will, He could certainly have taken retribution from them Himself. But He wills to challenge you with others, but those who are slain in the way of God, He will never let their deeds be lost"
  47,5,Soon will He guide them and improve their condition
  47,6,And admit them to the garden which He has announced for them
  47,7,"O you who believe, if you will aid God, He will aid you, and plant your feet firmly"
  47,8,"But those who reject God, for them is destruction, and God will render their deeds lost"
  47,9,Because they hate the revelation of God. So He has made their deeds fruitless
  47,10,"Do they not travel through the earth and see what the end of those before them was? God brought utter destruction on them, and a similar fate awaits those who reject God"
  47,11,"Because God is the Protector of those who believe, but those who reject God have no protector"
