  20,65,"They said, “O Moses, would you rather that you throw first, or that we be the first to throw?”"
  20,66,"He said, “No please, throw first.” Then behold, their ropes and their staffs. And it seemed to him on account of their illusions that they began to move"
  20,67,Then Moses sensed fear in himself
  20,68,"We said, “Fear not, for you have indeed the upper hand"
  20,69,"“Present that which is in your right hand. Quickly it will swallow up that which they had faked. What they had faked is but an illusionist’s trick and the illusionist thrives not, no matter where he goes.”"
  20,70,"So the illusionists were humbled. They said, “We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.”"
  20,71,"He said, “Believe in Him before I give you permission? Surely this must be your leader, who has taught you illusions. Indeed I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will have you crucified on trunks of palm trees. So you will know for certain which of us can give more severe and more lasting punishment.”"
  20,72,"They said, “Never will we consider you more than the clear signs that have come to us, or more than Him Who created us. So do whatever you want to do, for you can only influence in the life of the present"
  20,73,"“For us, we have believed in our Lord. May He forgive us our faults, and the illusions to which you compelled us to do, for God is Best and Ever Lasting.”"
  20,74,"Indeed he who returns to his Lord as a wrong-doer, for him is hell. Therein will he neither die nor live"
  20,75,"But those who come to Him as believers who have worked righteous deeds, for them are ranks exalted"
  20,76,"Gardens of eternity, beneath which rivers flow. They will dwell therein forever. Such is the reward of those who refine themselves"
