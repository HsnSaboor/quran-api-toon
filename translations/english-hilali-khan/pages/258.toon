quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  14,19,"Do you not see that Allâh has created the heavens and the earth with truth? If He wills, He can remove you and bring (in your place) a new creation!",""
  14,20,"And for Allâh that is not hard or difficult.",""
  14,21,"And they all shall appear before Allâh (on the Day of Resurrection); then the weak will say to those who were arrogant (chiefs): ""Verily, we were following you; can you avail us anything against Allâh’s Torment?"" They will say: ""Had Allâh guided us, we would have guided you. It makes no difference to us (now) whether we rage, or bear (these torments) with patience; there is no place of refuge for us.""",""
  14,22,"And Shaitân (Satan) will say when the matter has been decided: ""Verily, Allâh promised you a promise of truth. And I too promised you, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I deny your former act in associating me (Satan) as a partner with Allâh (by obeying me in the life of the world). Verily, there is a painful torment for the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).""",""
  14,23,"And those who believed (in the Oneness of Allâh and His Messengers and whatever they brought) and did righteous deeds, will be made to enter Gardens under which rivers flow, - to dwell therein for ever (i.e. in Paradise), with the Permission of their Lord. Their greeting therein will be: Salâm (peace!).<sup>2</sup>","[2] (V.14:23) See the footnote of (V.4:86)."
  14,24,"See you not how Allâh sets forth a parable? A goodly word as a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches (reach) to the sky (i.e. very high).",""
