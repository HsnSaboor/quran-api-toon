  14,6,"And (remember) when Mûsâ (Moses) said to his people: ""Call to mind Allâh’s Favour to you, when He delivered you from Fir‘aun’s (Pharaoh) people who were afflicting you with horrible torment, and were slaughtering your sons and letting your women alive; and in it was a tremendous trial from your Lord.""",""
  14,7,"And (remember) when your Lord proclaimed: ""If you give thanks (by accepting Faith and worshipping none but Allâh), I will give you more (of My Blessings); but if you are thankless (i.e. disbelievers), verily My punishment is indeed severe.""",""
  14,8,"And Mûsâ (Moses) said: ""If you disbelieve, you and all on earth together, then verily Allâh is Rich (Free of all needs), Owner of all Praise.""",""
  14,9,"Has not the news reached you, of those before you, the people of Nûh (Noah), and ‘Âd, and Thamûd? And those after them? None knows them but Allâh. To them came their Messengers with clear proofs, but they put their hands in their mouths (biting them from anger) and said: ""Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent, and we are really in grave doubt as to that to which you invite us (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism).""",""
  14,10,"Their Messengers said: ""What! Can there be a doubt about Allâh, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He calls you (to Monotheism and to be obedient to Allâh) that He may forgive you of your sins and give you respite for a term appointed."" They said: ""You are no more than human beings like us! You wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship. Then bring us a clear authority (i.e. a clear proof of what you say).""",""
