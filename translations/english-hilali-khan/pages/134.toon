  6,53,"Thus We have tried some of them with others, that they might say: ""Is it these (poor believers) whom Allâh has favoured from amongst us?"" Does not Allâh know best those who are grateful?",""
  6,54,"When those who believe in Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) come to you, say: ""Salâmun ‘Alaikum"" (peace be on you); your Lord has written (prescribed) Mercy for Himself, so that if any of you does evil in ignorance, and thereafter repents and does righteous good deeds (by obeying Allâh), then surely, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  6,55,"And thus do We explain the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in detail, that the way of the Mujrimûn (criminals, polytheists, sinners) may become manifest.",""
  6,56,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""I have been forbidden to worship those whom you invoke (worship) besides Allâh."" Say: ""I will not follow your vain desires. If I did, I would go astray, and I would not be one of the rightly guided.""",""
  6,57,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""I am on clear proof from my Lord (Islâmic Monotheism), but you deny it (the truth that has come to me from Allâh). I have not gotten what you are asking for impatiently (the torment). The decision is only for Allâh, He declares the truth, and He is the Best of judges.""",""
  6,58,"Say: ""If I had that which you are asking for impatiently (the torment), the matter would have been settled at once between me and you, but Allâh knows best the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).""",""
  6,59,"And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but he knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.",""
