quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,18,"And (both) the Jews and the Christians say: ""We are the children of Allâh and His loved ones."" Say: ""Why then does He punish you for your sins?"" Nay, you are but human beings of those He has created, He forgives whom He wills and He punishes whom He wills. And to Allâh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them; and to Him is the return (of all).",""
  5,19,"O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Now has come to you Our Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) making (things) clear unto you, after a break in (the series of) Messengers, lest you say: ""There came unto us no bringer of glad tidings and no warner.<sup>8</sup>"" But now has come unto you a bringer of glad tidings and a warner. And Allâh is Able to do all things.","[8] (V.5:19)\na) See the footnote of (V.3:85) and see (V.3:116).\nb) See the footnote (B) of (V.2:252)."
  5,20,"And (remember) when Mûsâ (Moses) said to his people: ""O my people! Remember the Favour of Allâh to you when He made Prophets among you, made you kings and gave you what He had not given to any other among the ‘Âlamîn (mankind and jinn, in the past).""",""
  5,21,"""O my people! Enter the holy land (Palestine) which Allâh has assigned to you and turn not back (in flight); for then you will be returned as losers.""",""
  5,22,"They said: ""O Mûsâ (Moses)! In it (this holy land) are a people of great strength, and we shall never enter it till they leave it; when they leave, then we will enter.""",""
  5,23,"Two men of those who feared (Allâh and) on whom Allâh had bestowed His Grace (they were يوشع وكالب Yûsha‘ and Kâlab) said: ""Assault them through the gate; for when you are in, victory will be yours; and put your trust in Allâh if you are believers indeed.""",""
