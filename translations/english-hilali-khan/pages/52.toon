  3,16,"Those who say: ""Our Lord! We have indeed believed, so forgive us our sins and save us from the punishment of the Fire.""",""
  3,17,"(They are) those who are patient, those who are true (in Faith, words, and deeds), and obedient with sincere devotion in worship to Allâh. Those who spend [give the Zakât and alms in the Way of Allâh] and those who pray and beg Allâh’s Pardon in the last hours of the night.",""
  3,18,"Allâh bears witness that Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He always) maintains His creation in Justice. Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.",""
  3,19,"Truly, the religion with Allâh is Islâm. Those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) did not differ except, out of mutual jealousy, after knowledge had come to them. And whoever disbelieves in the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh, then surely, Allâh is Swift in calling to account.",""
  3,20,"So if they dispute with you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) say: ""I have submitted myself to Allâh (in Islâm), and (so have) those who follow me."" And say to those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and to those who are illiterates (Arab pagans): ""Do you (also) submit yourselves (to Allâh in Islâm)?"" If they do, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the Message; and Allâh is All-Seer of (His) slaves<sup>2</sup>.","[2] (V.3:20): See footnote of (V.3:85)."
  3,21,"Verily! Those who disbelieve in the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh and kill the Prophets without right, and kill those men who order just dealings, ... then announce to them a painful torment.",""
  3,22,"They are those whose works will be lost in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers.",""
