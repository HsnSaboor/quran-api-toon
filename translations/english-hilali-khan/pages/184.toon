  8,54,"Similar to the behaviour of the people of Fir‘aun (Pharaoh), and those before them. They belied the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of their Lord, so We destroyed them for their sins, and We drowned the people of Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) for they were all Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).",""
