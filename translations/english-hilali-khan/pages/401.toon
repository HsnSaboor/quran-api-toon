  29,39,"And (We destroyed also) Qârûn (Korah), Fir‘aun (Pharaoh), and Hâmân. And indeed Mûsâ (Moses) came to them with clear Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), but they were arrogant in the land, yet they could not outstrip Us (escape Our punishment).",""
  29,40,"So We punished each (of them) for his sins; of them were some on whom We sent Hâsib (a violent wind with shower of stones) [as on the people of Lût (Lot)], and of them were some who were overtaken by As-Saihah [torment - awful cry. (as Thamûd or Shu‘aib’s people)], and of them were some whom We caused the earth to swallow [as Qârûn (Korah)], and of them were some whom We drowned [as the people of Nûh (Noah), or Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his people]. It was not Allâh Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves.",""
  29,41,"The likeness of those who take (false deities as) Auliyâ’ (protectors, helpers) other than Allâh is the likeness of a spider who builds (for itself) a house; but verily, the frailest (weakest) of houses is the spider’s house - if they but knew.",""
  29,42,"Verily, Allâh knows what things they invoke instead of Him. He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.<sup>7</sup>","[7] (V.29:42) See the footnote of (V.2:165)."
  29,43,"And these similitudes We put forward for mankind; but none will understand them except those who have knowledge (of Allâh and His Signs).",""
  29,44,"(Allâh says to His Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""Allâh (Alone) created the heavens and the earth with truth (and none shared Him in their creation)."" Verily! Therein is surely a sign for those who believe.",""
  29,45,"Recite (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) what has been revealed to you of the Book (the Qur’ân), and perform As-Salât (Iqamât-as-Salât). Verily, As-Salât (the prayer) prevents from Al-Fahshâ’ (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse) and Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed)<sup>8</sup> and the remembering<sup>9</sup> (praising) of (you by) Allâh (in front of the angels) is greater indeed [than your remembering (praising) of Allâh in prayers. And Allâh knows what you do.","[8] (V.29:45) It is said by Ibn ‘Abbâs and ‘Abdullâh bin Mas‘ûd رضي الله عنهم: If the Salât (prayer) of anyone does not prevent him from Al-Fâhshâ’ and Al-Munkar (all kinds of evil, illegal and sinful deeds), then his Salât (prayer) increases him in nothing but loss, and to be far away from his Lord (Allah) [Tafsir Al-Qurtubi].\n[9] (V.29:45) See the footnotes of (V.13:28) and also (B) of (V.2:152)."
