  4,155,"Because of their breaking the covenant, and of their rejecting the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh, and of their killing the Prophets unjustly, and of their saying: ""Our hearts are wrapped (with coverings, i.e. we do not understand what the Messengers say)"" - nay, Allâh has set a seal upon their hearts because of their disbelief, so they believe not but a little.",""
  4,156,"And because of their (Jews) disbelief and uttering against Maryam (Mary السلام عليهما) a grave false charge (that she has committed illegal sexual intercourse);",""
  4,157,"And because of their saying (in boast), ""We killed Messiah ‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), the Messenger of Allâh,"" - but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them [the resemblance of ‘Îsâ (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man)], and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not [i.e. ‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) عليهما السلام]:",""
  4,158,"But Allâh raised him [‘Îsâ (Jesus)] up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he عليه السلام is in the heavens). And Allâh is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.",""
  4,159,"And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must believe in him [‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), as only a Messenger of Allâh and a human being]<sup>42</sup> before his [‘Îsâ (Jesus) عليه السلام) or a Jew’s or a Christian’s] death<sup>43</sup> (at the time of the appearance of the angel of death). And on the Day of Resurrection, he [‘Îsâ (Jesus)] will be a witness against them.","[42] (V.4:159) See the footnote of (V.3:55).\n[43] (V.4:159) - ""Before his death,"" has two interpretations: before Jesus’ death after his descent from the heavens, or a Jew’s or a Christian’s death, at the time of the appearance of the Angel of Death when he will realize that ‘Îsâ (Jesus) was only a Messenger of Allâh, and had no share in Divinity."
  4,160,"For the wrong-doing of the Jews, We made unlawful for them certain good foods which had been lawful for them - and for their hindering many from Allâh’s Way;",""
  4,161,"And their taking of Ribâ (usury) though they were forbidden from taking it and their devouring of men’s substance wrongfully (bribery). And We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful torment.",""
  4,162,"But those among them who are well-grounded in knowledge, and the believers, believe in what has been sent down to you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and what was sent down before you; and those who perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât ), and give Zakât and believe in Allâh and in the Last Day, it is they to whom We shall give a great reward.",""
