  57,25,"Indeed We have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance (justice) that mankind may keep up justice. And We brought forth iron wherein is mighty power (in matters of war<sup>3</sup>), as well as many benefits for mankind, that Allâh may test who it is that will help Him (His religion) and His Messengers in the unseen. Verily, Allâh is All-Strong, All-Mighty.","[3] (V.57:25) Paradise is under the blades of swords (in Jihâd in Allâh’s cause).\na) Narrated Al-Mughîrah bin Shu‘bah رضي الله عنه : Our Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم told us about the Message of our Lord that...""whoever amongst us is killed (in Jihâd in Allâh’s cause) will go to Paradise"". ‘Umar asked the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم "" Is it not true that our men who are killed (in Jihâd in Allâh’s cause) will go to Paradise and theirs (i.e. those of the pagan’s) will go to the (Hell) Fire?"" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Yes"".\nb) Narrated ‘Abdullâh bin Abî Aufâ رضي الله عنهما ! Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Know that Paradise is under the shades of sword (Jihâd in Allâh’s cause). (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.4, Hadîth No.73 and its chapter No.22)."
  57,26,"And indeed, We sent Nûh (Noah) and Ibrâhîm (Abraham), and placed in their offspring Prophethood and Scripture. And among them there are some who are guided; but many of them are Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh).",""
  57,27,"Then, We sent after them Our Messengers, and We sent ‘Îsâ (Jesus) - son of Maryam (Mary), and gave him the Injeel (Gospel). And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and mercy. But the monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them, but (they sought it) only to please Allâh therewith, but they did not observe it with the right observance. So We gave those among them who believed their (due) reward; but many of them are Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh).",""
  57,28,"O you who believe [in Mûsâ (Moses) (i.e. Jews) and ‘Îsâ (Jesus) (i.e. Christians)]! Fear Allâh, and believe in His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), He will give you a double portion of His Mercy, and He will give you a light by which you shall walk (straight). And He will forgive you. And Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.<sup>4</sup>","[4] (V.57:28)\n(a) Narrated Abû Buradah’s father: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Any man who has a slave-girl whom he educates properly, teaches good manners, manumits and marries her will get a double reward. And if any man of the people of the Scriptures (Jews and Christians) believes in his own Prophet and then believes in me (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) too, he will (also) get a double reward. And any slave who fulfils his duty to his master and to his Lord (Allâh) will (also) get a double reward."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.7, Hadîth No.20).\n(b) It is obligatory to have Belief in the Messengership of the Prophet (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم).\nNarrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""By Him (Allâh) in Whose Hand Muhammad’s soul is, there is none from amongst the Jews and the Christians (of these present nations) who hears about me and then dies without believing in the Message with which I have been sent (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism), but he will be from the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire."" (Sahih Muslim , the Book of Faith, Vol.1, Chapter No.240) See also (V.3:85) and (V.3:116)."
  57,29,"So that the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) may know that they have no power whatsoever over the Grace of Allâh, and that (His) Grace is (entirely) in His Hand to bestow it on whomsoever He wills. And Allâh is the Owner of Great Bounty.",""
