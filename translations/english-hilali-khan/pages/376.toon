  26,214,"And warn your tribe (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) of near kindred.<sup>4</sup>","[4] (V.26:214) Narrated Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما: When the Verse: ""And warn your tribe (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) of near kindred."" (V.26:214) was revealed, Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم went out, and when he had ascended As-Safa mountain, he shouted, ""Yâ Sabâhâh!*"" The people said, ""Who is that?"" ""Then they gathered around him, whereupon he said, ""Do you see? If I inform you that cavalrymen are proceeding up the side of this mountain, will you believe me?"" They said, ""We have never heard you telling a lie."" Then he said, ""I am a plain warner to you of a coming severe punishment."" Abû Lahab said: ""May you perish! You gathered us only for this reason?"" Then Abû Lahab went away. So Sûrat Al-Masad ""Perish the hands of Abû Lahab!"" (V.111:1) was revealed. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadîth No.495).\n* ""Yâ Sabâhâh!"" is an Arabic expression used when one appeals for help or draws the attention of others to some danger."

  26,226,"And that they say what they do not do.",""
  26,227,"Except those who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous deeds, and remember Allâh much, and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged [by replying back in poetry to the unjust poetry (which the pagan poets utter against the Muslims)]. And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.",""
