quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  21,36,"And when those who disbelieved (in the Oneness of Allâh) see you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), they take you not except for mockery (saying): ""Is this the one who talks (badly) about your gods?"" While they disbelieve at the mention of the Most Gracious (Allâh). [Tafsir Al-Qurtubî].",""
  21,37,"Man is created of haste. I will show you My Ayât (torments, proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.). So ask Me not to hasten (them).",""
  21,38,"And they say: ""When will this promise (come to pass), if you are truthful.""",""
  21,39,"If only those who disbelieved knew (the time) when they will not be able to ward off the Fire from their faces, nor from their backs, and they will not be helped.",""
  21,40,"Nay, it (the Fire or the Day of Resurrection) will come upon them all of a sudden and will perplex them, and they will have no power to avert it nor will they get respite.",""
  21,41,"Indeed, (many) Messengers were mocked before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), but the scoffers were surrounded by that, whereat they used to mock.",""
  21,42,"Say: ""Who can guard and protect you in the night or in the day from the (punishment of the) Most Gracious (Allâh)?"" Nay, but they turn away from the remembrance of their Lord.",""
  21,43,"Or have they âlihah (gods) who can guard them from Us? They have no power to help themselves, nor can they be protected from Us (i.e. from Our Torment).",""
  21,44,"Nay, We gave the luxuries of this life to these men and their fathers until the period grew long for them. See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders? Is it then they who will overcome?<sup>2</sup>","[2] (V.21:44). ""See they not that We gradually reduce the land (of disbelievers, by giving it to the believers, in war victories) from its outlying borders. And Allâh judges, there is none to put back His Judgement and He is Swift at reckoning."" [The Qur’ân, Verse 13:41]"
