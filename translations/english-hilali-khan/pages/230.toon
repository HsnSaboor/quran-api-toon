They shall not reach you!<sup>6</sup> So travel with your family in a part of the night, and let not any of you look back; but your wife (will remain behind), verily, the punishment which will afflict them, will afflict her. Indeed, morning is their appointed time. Is not the morning near?""","[6] (V.11:81) See the Qur’ân (V.54:33-39)."
