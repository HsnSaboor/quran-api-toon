  2,211,"Ask the Children of Israel how many clear Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) We gave them. And whoever changes Allâh’s Favour after it had come to him, [e.g. renounces the Religion of Allâh (Islâm) and accepts Kufr (disbelief)] then surely, Allâh is Severe in punishment.",""
  2,212,"Beautified is the life of this world for those who disbelieve, and they mock at those who believe. But those who obey Allâh’s Orders and keep away from what He has forbidden, will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. And Allâh gives (of His Bounty, Blessings, Favours, Honours on the Day of Resurrection) to whom He wills without limit.",""
  2,213,"Mankind were one community and Allâh sent Prophets with glad tidings and warnings, and with them He sent down the Scripture in truth to judge between people in matters wherein they differed. And only those to whom (the Scripture) was given differed concerning it after clear proofs had come unto them through hatred, one to another. Then Allâh by His Leave guided those who believed to the truth of that wherein they differed. And Allâh guides whom He wills to the Straight Path.",""
  2,214,"Or think you that you will enter Paradise without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you? They were afflicted with severe poverty and ailments and were so shaken that even the Messenger and those who believed along with him said, ""When (will come) the Help of Allâh?"" Yes! Certainly, the Help of Allâh is near!",""
  2,215,"They ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) what they should spend. Say: Whatever you spend of good must be for parents and kindred and orphans and Al-Masâkîn (the poor) and the wayfarer, and whatever you do of good deeds, truly, Allâh knows it well.",""
