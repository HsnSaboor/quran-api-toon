  9,14,"Fight against them so that Allâh will punish them by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal the breasts of a believing people,",""
  9,15,"And remove the anger of their (believers’) hearts. Allâh accepts the repentance of whom He wills. Allâh is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",""
  9,16,"Do you think that you shall be left alone while Allâh has not yet tested those among you who have striven hard and fought and have not taken Walîjah [(Bitânah - helpers, advisors and consultants from disbelievers, pagans.) giving openly to them their secrets] besides Allâh, and His Messenger, and the believers. Allâh is Well-Acquainted with what you do.",""
  9,17,"It is not for the Mushrikûn (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh), to maintain the Mosques of Allâh (i.e. to pray and worship Allâh therein, to look after their cleanliness and their building,), while they witness against their ownselves of disbelief. The works of such are in vain and in Fire shall they abide.",""
  9,18,"The Mosques of Allâh shall be maintained only by those who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât and fear none but Allâh. It is they who are on true guidance.",""
  9,19,"Do you consider the providing of drinking water to the pilgrims and the maintenance of Al-Masjidal-Harâm (at Makkah) as equal to the worth of those who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, and strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allâh? They are not equal before Allâh. And Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).",""
  9,20,"Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) and emigrated and strove hard and fought in Allâh’s Cause with their wealth and their lives are far higher in degree with Allâh. They are the successful.<sup>3</sup>","[3] (V.9:20).\na. Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Whoever believes in Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم performs Salât (Iqamât-as-Salât) and observes Saum (fasts) during the month of Ramadan, then it will be a promise binding upon Allâh to admit him to Paradise, no matter whether he fights in Allâh’s Cause or remains in the land where he is born."" The people said, ""O Allâh’s Messenger! Shall we acquaint the people with this good news?"" He said, ""Paradise has one hundred grades which Allâh has reserved for the Mujahidûn who fight in His Cause, and the distance between each of two grades is like the distance between the heaven and the earth. So, when you ask Allâh (for something), ask for Al-Firdaus which is the middle and highest part of Paradise."" [the subnarrator added, ""I think the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم also said, ‘Above it (i.e. Al-Firdaus ) is the Throne of the Most Gracious (i.e. Allâh), and from it gushes forth the rivers of Paradise]."" (Sahih Al Bukhârî, Vol.4, Hadith No.48).\nb. The wish for martyrdom.\nNarrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""By Him in Whose Hand my soul is! Were it not for some men amongst the believers who dislike to be left behind me, and whom I cannot provide with means of conveyance, I would certainly never remain behind any Sariya (army unit) going out for Jihâd in Allâh’s Cause. By Him in Whose Hand my soul is! I would love to be martyred in Allâh’s Cause and then come back to life, and then get martyred and then come back to life again, and then get martyred and then come back to life again, and then get martyred."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadith No.54)."
