quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  16,27,"Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will disgrace them and will say: ""Where are My (so called) partners concerning whom you used to disagree and dispute (with the believers, by defying and disobeying Allâh)?"" Those who have been given the knowledge (about the Torment of Allâh for the disbelievers) will say: ""Verily! Disgrace and misery this Day are upon the disbelievers.",""
  16,28,"""Those whose lives the angels take while they are doing wrong to themselves (by disbelief and by associating partners in worship with Allâh and by committing all kinds of crimes and evil deeds)."" Then, they will make (false) submission (saying): ""We used not to do any evil."" (The angels will reply): ""Yes! Truly, Allâh is All-Knower of what you used to do.",""
  16,29,"""So enter the gates of Hell, to abide therein,<sup>11</sup> and indeed, what an evil abode will be for the arrogant.""","[11] (V.16:29) See the footnote of (V.2:31)"
  16,30,"And (when) it is said to those who are the Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2) ""What is it that your Lord has sent down?"" They say: ""That which is good."" For those who do good in this world, there is good, and the home of the Hereafter will be better. And excellent indeed will be the home (i.e. Paradise) of the Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2).",""
  16,31,"‘Adn (Eden) Paradise (Gardens of Eternity) which they will enter, under which rivers flow, they will have therein all that they wish. Thus Allâh rewards the Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2).",""
  16,32,"Those whose lives the angels take while they are in a pious state (i.e. pure from all evil, and worshipping none but Allâh Alone) saying (to them): Salâmun ‘Alaikum (peace be on you) enter you Paradise, because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world).""",""
  16,33,"Do they (the disbelievers and polytheists) await but that the angels should come to them [to take away their souls (at death)], or there should come the command (i.e. the torment or the Day of Resurrection) of your Lord? Thus did those before them. And Allâh wronged them not, but they used to wrong themselves.",""
  16,34,"Then, the evil results of their deeds overtook them, and that at which they used to mock at surrounded them.",""
