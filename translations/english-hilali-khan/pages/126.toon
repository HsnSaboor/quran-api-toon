quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,109,"On the Day when Allâh will gather the Messengers together and say to them: ""What was the response you received (from men to your teaching)?"" They will say: ""We have no knowledge, verily, only You are the All-Knower of all that is hidden (or unseen).""",""
  5,110,"(Remember) when Allâh will say (on the Day of Resurrection). ""O ‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Remember My Favour to you and to your mother when I supported you with Rûh-ul-Qudus [Jibrîl (Gabriel)] so that you spoke to the people in the cradle<sup>38</sup> and in maturity; and when I taught you writing, Al-Hikmah (the power of understanding), the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel); and when you made out of the clay a figure like that of a bird, by My Permission, and you breathed into it, and it became a bird by My Permission, and you healed those born blind, and the lepers by My Permission, and when you brought forth the dead by My Permission; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from you (when they resolved to kill you) as you came unto them with clear proofs, and the disbelievers among them said: ‘This is nothing but evident magic.’""","[38] (V.5:110) See the footnote (V.3:46)."
  5,111,"And when I (Allâh) revealed to Al-Hawâriyyûn (the disciples) [of ‘Îsâ (Jesus)] to believe in Me and My Messenger, they said: ""We believe. And bear witness that we are Muslims.""",""
  5,112,"(Remember) when Al-Hawâriyyûn (the disciples) said: ""O ‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Can your Lord send down to us a table spread (with food) from heaven?"" ‘Îsâ (Jesus) said: ""Fear Allâh, if you are indeed believers.""",""
  5,113,"They said: ""We wish to eat thereof and to satisfy our hearts (to be stronger in Faith), and to know that you have indeed told us the truth and that we ourselves be its witnesses.""",""
