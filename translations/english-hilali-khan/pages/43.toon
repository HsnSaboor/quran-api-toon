quran[3]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,257,"Allâh is the Walî (Protector or Guardian) of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light. But as for those who disbelieve, their Auliyâ (supporters and helpers) are Tâghût [false deities and false leaders], they bring them out from light into darkness. Those are the dwellers of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever. (See V.2:81,82)",""
  2,258,"Have you not looked at him who disputed with Ibrâhîm (Abraham) about his Lord (Allâh), because Allâh had given him the kingdom? When Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said (to him): ""My Lord (Allâh) is He Who gives life and causes death."" He said, ""I give life and cause death."" Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said, ""Verily! Allâh brings the sun from the east; then bring it you from the west."" So the disbeliever was utterly defeated. And Allâh guides not the people, who are Zâlimûn (wrong-doers).",""
  2,259,"Or like the one who passed by a town while it had tumbled over its roofs. He said: ""Oh! How will Allâh ever bring it to life after its death?"" So Allâh caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: ""How long did you remain (dead)?"" He (the man) said: ""(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day"". He said: ""Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change; and look at your donkey! And thus We have made of you a sign for the people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh"". When this was clearly shown to him, he said, ""I know (now) that Allâh is Able to do all things.""",""
