quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,58,"And (remember) when We said: ""Enter this town (Jerusalem) and eat bountifully therein with pleasure and delight wherever you wish, and enter the gate in prostration (or bowing with humility) and say: ‘Forgive us,’ and We shall forgive you your sins and shall increase (reward) for the good-doers.""",""
  2,59,"But those who did wrong changed the word from that which had been told to them for another, so We sent upon the wrong-doers Rijz (a punishment)<sup>14</sup> from the heaven because of their rebelling against Allâh’s obedience. (Tafsir At-Tabarî).","[14] (V.2:59) Narrated Usâmah bin Zaid رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Plague was a means of torture sent on a group of Israelis (or on some people before you). So if you hear of its spread in a land, don’t approach it, and if plague should appear in a land where you are present, then don’t leave that land in order to run away from it (i.e. plague)."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri Vol.4, Hadîth No.679)."
  2,60,"And (remember) when Mûsâ (Moses) asked for water for his people, We said: ""Strike the stone with your stick."" Then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs. Each (group of) people knew its own place for water. ""Eat and drink of that which Allâh has provided and do not act corruptly, making mischief on the earth.""",""
  2,61,"And (remember) when you said, ""O Mûsâ (Moses)! We cannot endure one kind of food. So invoke your Lord for us to bring forth for us of what the earth grows, its herbs, its cucumbers, its Fûm (wheat or garlic), its lentils and its onions."" He said, ""Would you exchange that which is better for that which is lower? Go you down to any town and you shall find what you want!"" And they were covered with humiliation and misery, and they drew on themselves the Wrath of Allâh. That was because they used to disbelieve the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations etc.) of Allâh and killed the Prophets wrongfully. That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds (in their disobedience to Allâh, i.e. commit crimes and sins).",""
