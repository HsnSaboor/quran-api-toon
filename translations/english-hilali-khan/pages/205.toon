  9,112,"(The believers whose lives Allâh has purchased are) those who turn to Allâh in repentance (from polytheism and hypocrisy, etc.), who worship (Him), who praise (Him), who fast (or go out in Allâh’s Cause), who bow down (in prayer), who prostrate themselves (in prayer), who enjoin (on people) Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all what Islâm has ordained) and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds and all that Islâm has forbidden), and who observe the limits set by Allâh (do all that Allâh has ordained and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which Allâh has forbidden). And give glad tidings to the believers.<sup>22</sup>","[22] (V.9:112) Narrated Sahl bin Sa‘d: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Whoever can guarantee (the chastity of) what is between his two jaw-bones and what is between his two legs (i.e., his mouth, tongue and his private parts)*. I guarantee Paradise for him."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.481)\n* i.e. whoever protects his tongue from illegal talk e.g., to tell lies, or backbiting, etc., and his mouth from eating and drinking forbidden illegal things, and his private parts from illegal sexual acts."
  9,113,"It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allâh’s Forgiveness for the Mushrikûn (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh), even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the Fire (because they died in a state of disbelief).",""
  9,114,"And Ibrâhîm’s (Abraham) invoking (of Allâh) for his father’s forgiveness was only because of a promise he [Ibrâhîm (Abraham)] had made to him (his father). But when it became clear to him [Ibrâhîm (Abraham)] that he (his father) is an enemy of Allâh, he dissociated himself from him. Verily Ibrâhîm (Abraham) was Awwah (one who invokes Allâh with humility, glorifies Him and remembers Him much) and was forbearing. (Tafsir Al-Qurtubî)<sup>23</sup>.","[23] (V.9:114) See the footnote of (V.6:74)."

  9,117,"Allâh has forgiven the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم), the Muhâjirûn (Muslim emigrants who left their homes and came to Al-Madinah) and the Ansâr (Muslims of Al-Madinah) who followed him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) in the time of distress (Tabûk expedition), after the hearts of a party of them had nearly deviated (from the Right Path), but He accepted their repentance. Certainly, He is unto them full of Kindness, Most Merciful.",""
