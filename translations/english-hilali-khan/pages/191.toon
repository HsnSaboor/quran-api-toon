quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,27,"Then after that Allâh will accept the repentance of whom He wills. And Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  9,28,"O you who believe (in Allâh’s Oneness and in His Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)! Verily, the Mushrikûn (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh, and in the Message of Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) are Najasun (impure).<sup>5</sup> So let them not come near Al-Masjidal-Harâm (at Makkah) after this year; and if you fear poverty, Allâh will enrich you if He wills, out of His Bounty. Surely, Allâh is All-Knowing, All-Wise.","[5] (V.9:28) Their impurity is spiritual and physical: spiritual, because they don’t believe in Allâh’s Oneness and in His Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ; and physical, because they lack personal hygiene (filthy as regards urine, stools and blood). And the word Najas is used only for those persons who have spiritual impurity e.g. Al-Mushrikûn"
  9,29,"Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allâh, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allâh and His Messenger Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islâm) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah <sup>6</sup> with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.","[6] (V.9:29) a) See the footnote of (V.2:193)\nb) Narrated Abû Hurairah رضي الله عنه : Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""The Hour will not be established untill you fight against the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say, ‘O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him’ "" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 4, Hadîth No.177)\nc) Jizyah a tax levied from the people of the Scriptures (Jews and Christians), who are under the protection of a Muslim government."
  9,30,"And the Jews say: ‘Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allâh, and the Christians say: Messiah is the son of Allâh. That is their saying with their mouths, resembling the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime. Allâh’s Curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth!<sup>7</sup>","[7] (V.9:30)\na) See the footnote of (V.2:116).\nb) See the footnote of (V.4:40) and the footnote (c) of (V.68:42)."
  9,31,"They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allâh (by obeying them in things which they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by Allâh), and (they also took as their Lord) Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] to worship none but One Ilâh (God - Allâh) Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He)<sup>8</sup>. Praise and glory be to Him (far above is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him).""","[8] (V.9:31) Once while Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم was reciting this Verse, ‘Adi bin Hâtim said, ""O Allâh’s Messenger! They do not worship them (i.e. the rabbis and monks)."" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""They certainly do. [They (i.e. the rabbis and monks) made lawful things as unlawful and unlawful things as lawful, and they (i.e. Jews and Christians) followed them; and by doing so, they really worshipped them]."" (Narrated by Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Jarîr)."
