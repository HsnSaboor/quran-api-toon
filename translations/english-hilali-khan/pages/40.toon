quran[3]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,246,"Have you not thought about the group of the Children of Israel after (the time of) Mûsâ (Moses)? When they said to a Prophet of theirs, ""Appoint for us a king and we will fight in Allâh’s Way."" He said, ""Would you then refrain from fighting, if fighting was prescribed for you?"" They said, ""Why should we not fight in Allâh’s Way while we have been driven out of our homes and our children (families have been taken as captives)?"" But when fighting was ordered for them, they turned away, all except a few of them. And Allâh is All-Aware of the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).",""
  2,247,"And their Prophet (Samuel عليه السلام) said to them, ""Indeed Allâh has appointed Tâlût (Saul) as a king over you."" They said, ""How can he be a king over us when we are fitter than him for the kingdom, and he has not been given enough wealth."" He said: ""Verily, Allâh has chosen him above you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allâh grants His kingdom to whom He wills. And Allâh is All-Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All-Knower.""",""
  2,248,"And their Prophet (Samuel عليه السلام) said to them: Verily! The sign of His kingdom is that there shall come to you At-Tâbût (a wooden box), wherein is Sakînah <sup>65</sup> (peace and reassurance) from your Lord and a remnant of that which Mûsâ (Moses) and Hârûn (Aaron) left behind, carried by the angels. Verily, in this is a sign for you if you are indeed believers.","[65] (V.2:248) Narrated Al-Barâ’: A man was reciting Sûrah Al-Kahf and his horse was tied with two ropes beside him. A cloud came down and spread over that man, and it kept on coming closer and closer to him till his horse started jumping (as if afraid of something). When it was morning, the man came to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and told him of that experience. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""That was As-Sakînah (tranquillity or peace and reassurance along with angels), which descended because of (the recitation of) the Qur’ân."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 6, Hadîth No.531)."
