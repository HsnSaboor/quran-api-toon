The day that some of the Signs of your Lord do come, no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before, nor earned good (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his Faith.

  6,159,"Verily, those who divide their religion and break up into sects (all kinds of religious sects)<sup>21</sup>, you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) have no concern in them in the least.
