  17,39,"This is (part) of Al-Hikmah (wisdom, good manners and high character) which your Lord has revealed to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم). And set not up with Allâh any other ilâh (god) lest you should be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected, (from Allâh’s Mercy).",""
  17,40,"Has then your Lord (O pagans of Makkah!) preferred for you sons, and taken for Himself from among the angels daughters? Verily you indeed utter an awful saying.",""
  17,41,"And surely, We have explained [Our Promises, Warnings and (set forth many) examples] in this Qur’ân that they (the disbelievers) may take heed, but it increases them in naught save aversion.",""
  17,42,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم to these polytheists, pagans): ""If there had been other âlihah (gods) along with Him as they assert, then they would certainly have sought out a way to the Lord of the Throne (seeking His Pleasures and to be near to Him).",""
  17,43,"Glorified and Exalted be He! High above (the great falsehood) that they say! (i.e. forged statements that there are other gods along with Allâh, but He is Allâh, the One, the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need. He begets not, nor was He begotten, and there is none comparable or coequal unto Him).",""
  17,44,"The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise. But you understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.",""
  17,45,"And when you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) recite the Qur’ân, We put between you and those who believe not in the Hereafter, an invisible veil<sup>8</sup> (or screen their hearts, so they hear or understand it not).","[8] (V.17:45) It is said in the Book of Tafsîr (Imâm Qurtubî) as regards this Verse (17:45):\nNarrated Sa‘îd bin Jubair رضي الله عنه ""When the Sûrah No.111 (Tabbat Yadâ) was revealed, the wife of Abu Lahab came looking for the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم while Abu Bakr رضي الله عنه, was sitting beside him. Abu Bakr said to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: ""I wish if you get aside (or go away) as she is coming to us, she may harm you."" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""There will be a screen set between me and her."" So she did not see him. She said to Abu Bakr: ""Your companion is saying poetry against me,"" Abu Bakr said: ""By Allâh, he does not say poetry."" She said: ""Do you believe that?"" Then she left. Abu Bakr said, ""O Allâh’s Messenger! She did not see you."" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""An angel was screening me from her."" [This Hadith is quoted in Musnad Abu Ya‘la.]\nIt is said that if the above Verse (17:45) is recited by a real believer (of Islâmic Monotheism) he will be screened from a disbeliever. (Allâh knows better). (Tafsîr Al-Qurtubî, Vol.10, Page 269)."
  17,46,"And We have put coverings over their hearts lest they should understand it (the Qur’ân), and in their ears deafness. And when you make mention of your Lord Alone [Lâ ilâha illallâh (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh) Islâmic Monotheism (توحيد الله)] in the Qur’ân, they turn on their backs, fleeing in extreme dislike.",""
  17,47,"We know best of what they listen to, when they listen to you. And when they take secret counsel, then the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) say: ""You follow none but a bewitched man.""",""
  17,48,"See what examples they have put forward for you. So they have gone astray, and never can they find a way.",""
  17,49,"And they say: ""When we are bones and fragments (destroyed), should we really be resurrected (to be) a new creation?""",""
