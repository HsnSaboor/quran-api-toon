quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,89,"And when there came to them (the Jews), a Book (this Qur’ân) from Allâh confirming what is with them [the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], although aforetime they had invoked Allâh (for coming of Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) in order to gain victory over those who disbelieved, then when there came to them that which they had recognised, they disbelieved in it. So let the Curse of Allâh be on the disbelievers.",""
  2,90,"How bad is that for which they have sold their ownselves, that they should disbelieve in that which Allâh has revealed (the Qur’ân), grudging that Allâh should reveal of His Grace unto whom He wills of His slaves. So they have drawn on themselves wrath upon wrath. And for the disbelievers, there is disgracing torment.",""
  2,91,"And when it is said to them (the Jews), ""Believe in what Allâh has sent down,"" they say, ""We believe in what was sent down to us."" And they disbelieve in that which came after it, while it is the truth confirming what is with them. Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to them): ""Why then have you killed the Prophets of Allâh aforetime, if you indeed have been believers?""",""
  2,92,"And indeed Mûsâ (Moses) came to you with clear proofs, yet you worshipped the calf after he left, and you were Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrongdoers).",""
  2,93,"And (remember) when We took your covenant and We raised above you the Mount (saying), ""Hold firmly to what We have given you and hear (Our Word)."" They said, ""We have heard and disobeyed."" And their hearts absorbed (the worship of) the calf because of their disbelief. Say: ""Worst indeed is that which your faith enjoins on you if you are believers.""",""
