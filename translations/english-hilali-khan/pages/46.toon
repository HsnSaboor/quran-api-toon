quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,270,"And whatever you spend for spendings (e.g., in Sadaqah - charity for Allâh’s Cause) or whatever vow you make, be sure Allâh knows it all. And for the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers) there are no helpers.",""
  2,271,"If you disclose your Sadaqât (alms-giving), it is well; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, that is better for you. (Allâh) will expiate you some of your sins. And Allâh is Well-Acquainted with what you do.",""
  2,272,"Not upon you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) is their guidance, but Allâh guides whom He wills. And whatever you spend in good, it is for yourselves, when you spend not except seeking Allâh’s Countenance. And whatever you spend in good, it will be repaid to you in full, and you shall not be wronged.",""
  2,273,"(Charity is) for Fuqarâ (the poor), who in Allâh’s Cause are restricted (from travel), and cannot move about in the land (for trade or work). The one who knows them not, thinks that they are rich because of their modesty. You may know them by their mark, they do not beg of people at all.<sup>72</sup> And whatever you spend in good, surely, Allâh knows it well.","[72] (V.2:273) The Arabic word Ilhâfa literally means: ""to beg with importunity,"" but Imâm Tabari in his Tafsir and the majority of the religious scholars agree that the Verse means: ""They do not beg of people at all."""
  2,274,"Those who spend their wealth (in Allâh’s Cause) by night and day, in secret and in public, they shall have their reward with their Lord. On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.<sup>73</sup>","[73] (V.2:274) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Seven people will be shaded by Allâh under His Shade on the Day (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) when there will be no shade except His. They are:\na) a just ruler;\nb) a young man who has been brought up in the worship of Allâh, [i.e. worships Allâh (Alone) sincerely from his childhood];\nc) a man whose heart is attached to the mosques (who offers the five compulsory congregational prayers in the mosques);\nd) two persons who love each other only for Allâh’s sake, and they meet and part in Allâh’s Cause only;\ne) a man who refuses the call of a charming woman of noble birth for illegal sexual intercourse with her and says: I fear Allâh;\nf) a person who practises charity so secretly that his left hand does not know what his right hand has given (i.e., nobody knows how much he has given in charity).\ng) a person who remembers Allâh in seclusion and his eyes become flooded with tears."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 2, Hadîth No.504)."
