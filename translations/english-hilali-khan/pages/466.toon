  39,68,"And the Trumpet will be blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will swoon away, except him whom Allâh wills. Then it will be blown a second time, and behold they will be standing, looking on (waiting).<sup>16</sup>","[16] (V.39:68).\na) Narrated Abû Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""I will be the first to raise my head after the second blowing of the Trumpet and will see Mûsâ (Moses) holding or clinging to the Throne; and I will not know whether he had been in that state all the time or after the blowing of the Trumpet."" (Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol. 6, Hadîth No.337).\nb) Narrated Abû Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Between the two blowings of the Trumpet there will be forty."" The people said, ""O Abû Hurairah! Forty days?"" I refused to reply. They said, ""Forty years?"" I refused to reply. They said, ""Forty Months?"" I refused to reply and added: Everything of a human body will waste away, perish or decay except the last coccyx bone (of the tail) and from that bone Allâh will reconstruct the whole body. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 6, Hadîth No.338)."
  39,69,"And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord (Allâh, when He will come to judge among men): and the Book will be placed (open); and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward; and it will be judged between them with truth, and they will not be wronged.",""
  39,70,"And each person will be paid in full of what he did; and He is Best Aware of what they do.",""
  39,71,"And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups till, when they reach it, the gates thereof will be opened (suddenly like a prison at the arrival of the prisoners). And its keepers will say, ""Did not the Messengers come to you from yourselves, reciting to you the Verses of your Lord, and warning you of the Meeting of this Day of yours?"" They will say: ""Yes, but the Word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers!""<sup>17</sup>","[17] (V.39:71) See the footnote of (V.3:85)."
  39,72,"It will be said (to them): ""Enter you the gates of Hell, to abide therein. And (indeed) what an evil abode of the arrogant!""",""

You have done well, so enter here to abide therein.""","[18] (V.39:73) ""Al-Muttaqûn"" See (V.2:2)."
  39,74,"And they will say: ""All the praises and thanks be to Allâh Who has fulfilled His Promise to us and has made us inherit (this) land. We can dwell in Paradise where we will; how excellent a reward for the (pious, good) workers!""",""
