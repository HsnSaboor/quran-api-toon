  5,65,"And if only the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) had believed (in Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and warded off evil (sin, ascribing partners to Allâh) and had become Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2) We would indeed have expiated from them their sins and admitted them to Gardens of pleasure (in Paradise).",""
  5,66,"And if only they had acted according to the Taurât (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), and what has (now) been sent down to them from their Lord (the Qur’ân), they would surely have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet. There are from among them people who are on the right course (i.e. they act on the revelation and believe in Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم as ‘Abdullâh bin Salâm<sup>23</sup> رضي الله عنه), but many of them do evil deeds.","[23] (V.5: 66) Narrated Anas رضي الله عنه: When the news of the arrival of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, at Al-Madinah reached ‘Abdullâh bin Salâm, he went to him (i.e. the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم) to ask him about certain things. He said, ""I am going to ask you about three things which only a Prophet can answer: What is the first sign of The Hour? What is the first food which the people of Paradise will eat? Why does a child attract the similarity to his father or to his mother?"" the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم replied, ""Jibrael (Gabriel) has just now informed me of that."" Ibn Salâm said, ""He [i.e. Jibrael (Gabriel)] is the enemy of the Jews from amongst the angels."" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""As for the first sign of The Hour, it will be a fire that will collect (or gather) the people from the east to the west. As for the first meal which the people of Paradise will eat, it will be the caudate (extra) lobe of the fish-liver. As for the child, if the man’s discharge precedes the woman’s discharge, the child attracts the similarity to the man, and if the woman’s discharge precedes the man’s, then the child attracts the similarity to the woman."" On this, ‘Abdullâh bin Salâm said, ""I testify that Lâ ilâha illallâh (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh) and that you are the Messenger of Allâh"", and added, ""O Allâh’s Messenger! Jews make such lies as make one astonished, so please ask them about me before they know about my conversion to Islâm.""\nThe Jews came and the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""What kind of man is ‘Abdullâh bin Salâm among you?"" They replied, ""The best of us and the son of the best of us and the most superior among us, and the son of the most superior among us."" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""What would you think if ‘Abdullâh bin Salâm should embrace Islâm?"" They said, ""May Allâh protect him from that."" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم repeated his question and they gave the same answer, then ‘Abdullâh came out to them and said. ""I testify that Lâ ilâha illallâh (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh), and that Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is the Messenger of Allâh!"" On this, the Jews said, ""He is the most wicked among us and the son of the most wicked among us."" So they degraded him. On this, he (i.e. ‘Abdullâh bin Salâm) said, ""It is this that I was afraid of, O Allâh’s Messenger."" (Sahih Al-Bukhârî, Vol.5, Hadîth No.275)."
  5,67,"O Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. Allâh will protect you from mankind. Verily, Allâh guides not the people who disbelieve.",""
  5,68,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) ""O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! You have nothing (as regards guidance) till you act according to the Taurât (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), and what has (now) been sent down to you from your Lord (the Qur’ân)."" Verily, that which has been sent down to you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) from your Lord increases in most of them (their) obstinate rebellion and disbelief. So be not sorrowful over the people who disbelieve.",""
  5,69,"Surely, those who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh, in His Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and all that was revealed to him from Allâh), and those who are the Jews and the Sabians and the Christians, - whosoever believed in Allâh and the Last Day, and worked righteousness, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.<sup>24</sup>","[24] (V.5:69) This verse (V.5:69) and (Verse 2:62) should not be misinterpreted by the reader as mentioned by Ibn ‘Abbâs (Tafsir At-Tabarî) that the provision of this Verse was abrogated by the (V.3:85). And after the coming of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, no other religion except Islâm will be accepted from anyone."
  5,70,"Verily, We took the covenant of the Children of Israel and sent Messengers to them. Whenever there came to them a Messenger with what they themselves desired not, - a group of them they called liars, and others among them they killed.",""
