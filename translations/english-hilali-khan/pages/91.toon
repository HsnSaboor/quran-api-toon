  4,80,"He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), has indeed obeyed Allâh, but he who turns away, then we have not sent you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as a watcher over them.<sup>28</sup>","[28] (V.4:80)\n(A) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Whoever obeys me, he obeys Allâh, and whoever disobeys me, he disobeys Allâh, and whoever obeys the ruler I appoint, he obeys me, and whoever disobeys him, he disobeys me."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.9, Hadîth No.251).\n(B) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""All my followers will enter Paradise except those who refuse."" They said, ""O Allâh’s Messenger! Who will refuse?"" He said, ""Whoever obeys me will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys me is the one who refuses (to enter it)."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.9, Hadîth No.384)."
  4,81,"They say: ""We are obedient,"" but when they leave you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), a section of them spend all night in planning other than what you say. But Allâh records their nightly (plots). So turn aside from them (do not punish them), and put your trust in Allâh. And Allâh is Ever All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.",""
  4,82,"Do they not then consider the Qur’ân carefully? Had it been from other than Allâh, they would surely have found therein many a contradiction.",""
  4,83,"When there comes to them some matter touching (public) safety or fear, they make it known (among the people); if only they had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly). Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of Allâh upon you, you would have followed Shaitân (Satan), save a few of you.",""
  4,84,"Then fight (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) in the Cause of Allâh, you are not tasked (held responsible) except for yourself, and incite the believers (to fight along with you), it may be that Allâh will restrain the evil might of the disbelievers. And Allâh is Stronger in Might and Stronger in punishing.",""
  4,85,"Whosoever intercedes for a good cause will have the reward thereof, and whosoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a share in its burden. And Allâh is Ever All-Able to do (and also an All-Witness to) everything.",""
  4,86,"When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally. Certainly, Allâh is Ever a Careful Account Taker of all things.<sup>29</sup>","[29] (V.4:86) How the Salâm (greeting) began.\nNarrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Allâh created Adam in His Image,* sixty cubits (about 30 metres) in height. When He created him, He said (to him), ""Go and greet that group of angels sitting there, and listen what they will say in reply to you, for that will be your greeting and the greeting of your offspring."" Adam (went and) said, ""As-Salâmu ‘Alaikum (peace be upon you)."" They replied, ""As-Salâmu ‘Alaikum wa Rahmatullah (Peace and Allâh’s Mercy be on you)."" So they increased ‘wa Rahmatullah ’ "" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, ""So, whoever will enter Paradise, will be of the shape and picture of Adam. Since then the creation of Adam’s (offspring) (i.e. stature of human beings) is being diminished continuously up to the present time."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.8, Hadîth No.246).\n*""His Image"" means that Adam has been bestowed with life, knowledge, power of hearing, seeing, understanding, but the features of Adam are different from those of Allâh, only the names are the same, e.g., Allâh has life and knowledge and power of understanding, and Adam also has them, but there is no comparison between the Creator and the created thing. As Allâh says in the Qur’ân: ""There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer."" (V.42:11), Allâh does not eat or sleep, while Adam used to eat and sleep [for details See Fath Al-Bâri, Vol.6, Page 108,9 and Vol.13, Page 238,9]."
