quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,102,"They followed what the Shayâtîn (devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the lifetime of Sulaimân (Solomon). Sulaimân did not disbelieve, but the Shayâtîn (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels, Hârût and Mârût, but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, ""We are only for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us)."" And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife, but they could not thus harm anyone except by Allâh’s Leave. And they learn that which harms them and profits them not. And indeed they knew that the buyers of it (magic) would have no share in the Hereafter. And how bad indeed was that for which they sold their ownselves, if they but knew.",""
  2,103,"And if they had believed, and guarded themselves from evil and kept their duty to Allâh, far better would have been the reward from their Lord, if they but knew!",""
  2,104,"O you who believe! Say not (to the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم) Râ‘ina <sup>19</sup> but say Unzurna (make us understand) and hear. And for the disbelievers there is a painful torment. (See Verse 4:46)","[19] (V.2:104) Râ‘ina In Arabic means ""Be careful; Listen to us, and we listen to you"", whereas in Hebrew it means ""an insult"", and the Jews used to say it to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم with bad intentions. (See V.4:46)"
  2,105,"Neither those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) nor Al-Mushrikûn (the idolaters, polytheists, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh, pagans, etc.) like that there should be sent down unto you any good from your Lord. But Allâh chooses for His Mercy whom He wills. And Allâh is the Owner of Great Bounty.",""
