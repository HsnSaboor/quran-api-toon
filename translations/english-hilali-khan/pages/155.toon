quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,38,"(Allâh) will say: ""Enter you in the company of nations who passed away before you, of men and jinn, into the Fire."" Every time a new nation enters, it curses its sister nation (that went before) until they will be gathered all together in the Fire. The last of them will say to the first of them: ""Our Lord! These misled us, so give them a double torment of the Fire."" He will say: ""For each one there is double (torment), but you know not.""",""
  7,39,"The first of them will say to the last of them: ""You were not better than us, so taste the torment for what you used to earn.""",""
  7,40,"Verily, those who belie Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations) and treat them with arrogance, for them the gates of heaven will not be opened, and they will not enter Paradise until the camel goes through the eye of the needle (which is impossible). Thus do We recompense the Mujrimûn (criminals, polytheists and sinners).",""
  7,41,"Theirs will be a bed of Hell (Fire), and over them coverings (of Hell-fire). Thus do We recompense the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).",""
  7,42,"But those who believed (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism), and worked righteousness - We tax not any person beyond his scope - such are the dwellers of Paradise. They will abide therein.",""
  7,43,"And We shall remove from their breasts any (mutual) hatred or sense of injury (which they had, if at all, in the life of this world); rivers flowing under them, and they will say: ""All the praises and thanks be to Allâh, Who has guided us to this, and never could we have found guidance, were it not that Allâh had guided us! Indeed, the Messengers of our Lord did come with the truth."" And it will be cried out to them: ""This is the Paradise which you have inherited for what you used to do.""",""
