  5,83,"And when they (who call themselves Christians) listen to what has been sent down to the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth they have recognised. They say: ""Our Lord! We believe; so write us down among the witnesses.",""
  5,84,"""And why should we not believe in Allâh and in that which has come to us of the truth (Islâmic Monotheism)? And we wish that our Lord will admit us (in Paradise on the Day of Resurrection) along with the righteous people (Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and his Companions رضي الله عنهم).""",""
  5,85,"So because of what they said, Allâh rewarded them Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), they will abide therein forever. Such is the reward of Al-Muhsinûn (the good-doers).",""
  5,86,"But those who disbelieved and belied Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they shall be the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire.",""
  5,87,"O you who believe! Make not unlawful the Tayyibât (all that is good as regards foods, things, deeds, beliefs, persons) which Allâh has made lawful to you, and transgress not. Verily, Allâh does not like the transgressors.",""
  5,88,"And eat of the things which Allâh has provided for you, lawful and good, and fear Allâh in Whom you believe.",""
  5,89,"Allâh will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths; for its expiation feed ten Masâkîn (poor persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn<sup>28</sup>. And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much)<sup>29</sup>. Thus Allâh make clear to you His Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) that you may be grateful.","[28] (V.5:89) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""We (Muslims) are the last (to come) in the world, but (will be) foremost on the Day of Resurrection."" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم also said, ""By Allâh, if anyone of you insists on fulfilling an oath by which he may harm his family, he commits a greater sin in Allâh’s consideration than that of dissolving his oath and making its expiation with that which Allâh has commanded. (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.8, Hadîth No.621).\n[29] (V.5:89) It is better not to take oaths, but if you have taken it, and later you find a better solution for the problem, then act according to the better one and give expiation for the oath."
