quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,75,"And what is wrong with you that you fight not in the Cause of Allâh, and for those weak, ill-treated and oppressed among men, women, and children, whose cry is: ""Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from You one who will protect, and raise for us from You one who will help.""",""
  4,76,"Those who believe, fight in the Cause of Allâh, and those who disbelieve, fight in the cause of Tâghût (Satan).<sup>26</sup> So fight you against the friends of Shaitân (Satan). Ever feeble indeed is the plot of Shaitân (Satan).","[26] (V.4:76) See the footnote of (V.2:256)."
  4,77,"Have you not seen those who were told to hold back their hands (from fighting) and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât but when the fighting was ordained for them, behold! a section of them fear men as they fear Allâh or even more. They say: ""Our Lord! Why have you ordained for us fighting? Would that You had granted us respite for a short period?"" Say: ""Short is the enjoyment of this world. The Hereafter is (far) better for him who fears Allâh, and you shall not be dealt with unjustly even equal to a scalish thread in the long slit of a date-stone.",""
  4,78,"""Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you even if you are in fortresses built up strong and high!"" And if some good reaches them, they say, ""This is from Allâh,"" but if some evil befalls them, they say, ""This is from you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)."" Say: ""All things are from Allâh,"" so what is wrong with these people that they fail to understand any word?",""
  4,79,"Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allâh, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself. And We have sent you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as a Messenger to mankind, and Allâh is Sufficient as a Witness.<sup>27</sup>","[27] (V.4:79) See the footnote (A) of the (V.2:252)."
