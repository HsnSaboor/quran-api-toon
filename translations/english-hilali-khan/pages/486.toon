quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  42,23,"That is (the Paradise) whereof Allâh gives glad tidings to His slaves who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds. Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم): ""No reward do I ask of you for this except to be kind to me for my kinship with you.""<sup>6</sup> And whoever earns a good righteous deed, We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof. Verily, Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate (the deeds of those who are obedient to Him).","[6] (V.42:23) i.e. I do not ask for any reward from you (in the form of wealth, money, etc.) for my preaching of Islamic Monotheism, but I only request you not to harm me for the kinship between you and me, as you are my tribesmen, and you have more right to obey me and follow me in my doctrine of Islamic Monotheism."
  42,24,"Or say they: ""He has invented a lie against Allâh?"" If Allâh willed, He could have sealed up your heart (so that you forget all that you know of the Qur’ân). And Allâh wipes out falsehood, and establishes the truth (Islâm) by His Word (this Qur’ân). Verily, He knows well what (secrets) are in the breasts (of mankind).",""
  42,25,"And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do.<sup>7</sup>","[7] (V.42:25)\nNarrated Shaddâd bin Aus رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, "" The most superior way of asking for forgiveness from Allah is: Allâhumma anta Rabbî, lâ ilâha illâ Anta. Anta khalaqtanî wa ana ‘abduka, wa ana ‘alâ ‘ahdika wa wa‘dika mastata‘tu. A‘ûdhu bika min sharri ma sana‘tu, Abû’u laka bi ni‘matika ‘alaiya, wa abû’u laka bi dhanbi faghfirlî fa innahu lâ yaghfiru dhdhunûba illâ Anta ’"" * The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added: ""If somebody recites it during the day with firm faith in it, and dies on the same day before the evening, he will be from the people of Paradise; and if somebody recites it at night with firm faith in it, and dies before the morning, he will be from the people of Paradise."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadîth No.318).\n* O Allah, You are my Lord! None has the right to be worshipped but You. You created me and I am Your slave, and I am faithful to my covenant and my promise (to You) as much as I can. I seek refuge with You from all the evil I have done. I acknowledge before You all the blessings You have bestowed upon me, and I confess to You all my sins. So I entreat You to forgive my sins, for nobody can forgive sins except You."
  42,26,"And He answers (the invocation of) those who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, and gives them increase of His Bounty. And as for the disbelievers, theirs will be a severe torment.",""
  42,27,"And if Allâh were to enlarge the provision for His slaves, they would surely rebel in the earth, but He sends down by measure as He wills. Verily! He is, in respect of His slaves, the Well-Aware, the All-Seer (of things that benefit them).",""
  42,28,"And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired, and spreads His Mercy. And He is the Walî (Helper, Supporter, Protector, Lord), Worthy of all Praise.",""
  42,29,"And among His Ayât (proofs, evidence, lessons, signs, etc.) is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and whatever moving (living) creatures He has dispersed in them both. And He is All-Potent over their assembling (i.e. resurrecting them on the Day of Resurrection after their death, and dispersion of their bodies) whenever He wills.",""
  42,30,"And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much. (See the Qur’ân Verse 35:45).",""
  42,31,"And you cannot escape from Allâh (i.e. His punishment) in the earth, and besides Allâh you have neither any Walî (guardian or a protector, helper) nor any helper.",""
