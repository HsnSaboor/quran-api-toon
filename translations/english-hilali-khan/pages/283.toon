  17,10,"And that those who believe not in the Hereafter, for them We have prepared a painful torment (Hell).",""
  17,11,"And man invokes (Allâh) for evil as he invokes (Allâh) for good and man is ever hasty [i.e., if he is angry with somebody, he invokes (saying): ""O Allâh! Curse him"" and that one should not do, but one should be patient].",""
  17,12,"And We have appointed the night and the day as two Ayât (signs etc.). Then, We have obliterated the sign of the night (with darkness) while We have made the sign of the day illuminating, that you may seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may know the number of the years and the reckoning. And We have explained everything (in detail) with full explanation.",""

The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said; (1) To perform the (daily compulsory) Salât (prayers) at their (early) stated fixed times; (2) To be good and dutiful to one’s own parents (3) and to participate in Jihâd in Allâh’s Cause.""
