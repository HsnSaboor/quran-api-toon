quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,95,"Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allâh with their wealth and their lives. Allâh has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allâh has promised good (Paradise), but Allâh has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward.",""
  4,96,"Degrees of (higher) grades from Him, and Forgiveness and Mercy. And Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  4,97,"Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): ""In what (condition) were you?"" They reply: ""We were weak and oppressed on the earth."" They (angels) say: ""Was not the earth of Allâh spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?"" Such men will find their abode in Hell - What an evil destination!<sup>31</sup>","[31] (V.4:97) See the footnote of the (V.3:149)."
  4,98,"Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way.",""

  4,100,"He who emigrates (from his home) in the Cause of Allâh, will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by. And whosoever leaves his home as an emigrant unto Allâh and His Messenger, and death overtakes him, his reward is then surely incumbent upon Allâh. And Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  4,101,"And when you (Muslims) travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten As-Salât (the prayer) if you fear that the disbelievers may put you in trial (attack you etc.), verily, the disbelievers are ever unto you open enemies.",""
