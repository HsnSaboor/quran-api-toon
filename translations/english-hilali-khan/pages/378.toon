quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  27,14,"And they belied them (those Ayât) wrongfully and arrogantly, though their ownselves were convinced thereof [i.e. those (Ayât ) are from Allâh, and Mûsâ (Moses) is the Messenger of Allâh in truth, but they disliked to obey Mûsâ (Moses), and hated to believe in his Message of Monotheism]. So see what was the end of the Mufsidûn (disbelievers, disobedient to Allâh, evil-doers and liars.).",""
  27,15,"And indeed We gave knowledge to Dâwûd (David) and Sulaimân (Solomon), and they both said: ""All the praises and thanks be to Allâh, Who has preferred us above many of His believing slaves!""",""
  27,16,"And Sulaimân (Solomon) inherited (the knowledge of) Dâwûd (David). He said: ""O mankind! We have been taught the language of birds, and on us have been bestowed all things. This, verily, is an evident grace (from Allâh).""",""
  27,17,"And there were gathered before Sulaimân (Solomon) his hosts of jinn and men, and birds, and they all were set in battle order (marching forward).",""
  27,18,"Till, when they came to the valley of the ants, one of the ants said: ""O ants! Enter your dwellings, lest Sulaimân (Solomon) and his hosts should crush you, while they perceive not.""",""
  27,19,"So he [Sulaimân (Solomon)] smiled, amused at her speech<sup>1</sup> and said: ""My Lord! Grant me the power and ability that I may be grateful for Your Favours which You have bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may do righteous good deeds that will please You, and admit me by Your Mercy among Your righteous slaves.""","[1] (V.27:19) See the footnote of (V.6:143)."
  27,20,"He inspected the birds, and said: ""What is the matter that I see not the hoopoe? Or is he among the absentees?",""
  27,21,"""I will surely punish him with a severe torment, or slaughter him, unless he brings me a clear reason.""",""
  27,22,"But the hoopoe stayed not long: he (came up and) said: ""I have grasped (the knowledge of a thing) which you have not grasped and I have come to you from Saba’ (Sheba) with true news.",""
