quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  12,23,"And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him (to do an evil act), and she closed the doors and said: ""Come on, O you."" He said: ""I seek refuge in Allâh (or Allâh forbid)! Truly, he (your husband) is my master! He made my living in a great comfort! (So I will never betray him). Verily, the Zâlimûn (wrong and evil-doers) will never be successful.""",""
  12,24,"And indeed she did desire him, and he would have inclined to her desire, had he not seen the evidence of his Lord. Thus it was, that We might turn away from him evil and illegal sexual intercourse. Surely, he was one of Our chosen (guided) slaves.",""
  12,25,"So they raced with one another to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back. They both found her lord (i.e. her husband) at the door. She said: ""What is the recompense (punishment) for him who intended an evil design against your wife, except that he be put in prison or a painful torment?""",""
  12,26,"He [Yûsuf (Joseph)] said: ""It was she that sought to seduce me;"" and a witness of her household bore witness (saying): ""If it be that his shirt is torn from the front, then her tale is true and he is a liar!",""
  12,27,"""But if it be that his shirt is torn from the back, then she has told a lie and he is speaking the truth!""",""
  12,28,"So when he (her husband) saw his [(Yûsuf’s (Joseph)] shirt torn at the back, he (her husband) said: ""Surely, it is a plot of you women! Certainly mighty is your plot!",""
  12,29,"""O Yûsuf (Joseph)! Turn away from this! (O woman!) Ask forgiveness for your sin. Verily, you were of the sinful.""",""
  12,30,"And women in the city said: ""The wife of Al-‘Azîz is seeking to seduce her (slave) young man, indeed she loves him violently; verily we see her in plain error.""",""
