quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  18,21,"And thus We made their case known (to the people), that they might know that the Promise of Allâh is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour. (Remember) when they (the people of the city) disputed among themselves about their case, they said: ""Construct a building over them; their Lord knows best about them;"" (then) those who won their point said (most probably the disbelievers): ""We verily shall build a place of worship over them.""",""
  18,22,"(Some) say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them; and (others) say they were five, the dog being the sixth, - guessing at the unseen; (yet others) say they were seven, and the dog being the eighth. Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""My Lord knows best their number; none knows them but a few."" So debate not (about their number) except with the clear proof (which We have revealed to you). And consult not any of them (people of the Scripture - Jews and Christians) about (the affair of) the people of the Cave.",""
  18,23,"And never say of anything, ""I shall do such and such thing tomorrow.""",""
  18,24,"Except (with the saying), ""If Allâh will!"" And remember your Lord when you forget and say: ""It may be that my Lord guides me unto a nearer way of truth than this.""",""
  18,25,"And they stayed in their Cave three hundred (solar) years, adding nine (for lunar years). (Tafsir Al-Qurtubi)",""
  18,26,"Say: ""Allâh knows best how long they stayed. With Him is (the knowledge of) the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. How clearly He sees, and hears (everything)! They have no Walî (Helper, Disposer of affairs, Protector) other than Him, and He makes none to share in His Decision and His Rule.""",""
  18,27,"And recite what has been revealed to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) of the Book (the Qur’ân) of your Lord (i.e. recite it, understand and follow its teachings and act on its orders and preach it to men). None can change His Words, and none will you find as a refuge other than Him.",""
