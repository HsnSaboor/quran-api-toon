  13,43,"And those who disbelieved, say: ""You (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) are not a Messenger."" Say: ""Sufficient as a witness between me and you is Allâh and those too who have knowledge of the Scripture (such as ‘Abdullâh bin Salâm and other Jews and Christians who embraced Islâm).""",""
  14,1,"Alif-Lâm-Râ. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur’ân, and none but Allâh (Alone) knows their meanings]. (This is) a Book which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness (of disbelief and polytheism) into light (of belief in the Oneness of Allâh and Islâmic Monotheism) by their Lord’s Leave to the Path of the All-Mighty, the Owner of all Praise.",""
  14,2,"Allâh to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth! And woe unto the disbelievers from a severe torment.",""
  14,3,"Those who prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter, and hinder (men) from the Path of Allâh (i.e. Islâm) and seek crookedness therein - they are far astray.",""
  14,4,"And We sent not a Messenger except with the language of his people, in order that he might make (the Message) clear for them. Then Allâh misleads whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.",""
  14,5,"And indeed We sent Mûsâ (Moses) with Our Ayât (signs, proofs, and evidence) (saying): ""Bring out your people from darkness into light, and remind them of the Annals of Allâh. Truly, therein are Ayât (evidence, proofs and signs) for every patient, thankful (person).""",""
