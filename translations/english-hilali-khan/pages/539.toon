quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  57,12,"On the Day you shall see the believing men and the believing women: their light running forward before them and by their right hands. Glad tidings for you this Day! Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever! Truly, this is the great success!",""
  57,13,"On the Day when the hypocrites - men and women - will say to the believers: ""Wait for us! Let us get something from your light!"" It will be said: ""Go back to your rear! Then seek a light!"" So a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein. Inside it will be mercy, and outside it will be torment.""",""
  57,14,"(The hypocrites) will call the believers: ""Were we not with you?"" The believers will reply: ""Yes! But you led yourselves into temptations, you looked forward for our destruction; you doubted (in Faith) and you were deceived by false desires, till the Command of Allâh came to pass. And the chief deceiver (Satan) deceived you in respect of Allâh.""",""
  57,15,"So this Day no ransom shall be taken from you (hypocrites), nor of those who disbelieved, (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism). Your abode is the Fire. That is your maulâ (friend - proper place), and worst indeed is that destination.",""
  57,16,"Has not the time come for the hearts of those who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) to be affected by Allâh’s Reminder (this Qur’ân), and that which has been revealed of the truth, lest they become as those who received the Scripture [the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] before (i.e. Jews and Christians), and the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened? And many of them were Fâsiqûn (the rebellious, the disobedient to Allâh).",""
  57,17,"Know that Allâh gives life to the earth after its death! Indeed We have made clear the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) to you, if you but understand.",""
  57,18,"Verily, those who give Sadaqât (i.e. Zakât and alms), men and women, and lend Allâh a goodly loan, it shall be increased manifold (to their credit), and theirs shall be an honourable good reward (i.e. Paradise).",""
