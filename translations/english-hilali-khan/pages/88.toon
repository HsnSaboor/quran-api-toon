  4,60,"Have you not seen those (hypocrites) who claim that they believe in that which has been sent down to you, and that which was sent down before you, and they wish to go for judgement (in their disputes) to the Tâghût <sup>24</sup> (false judges) while they have been ordered to reject them. But Shaitân (Satan) wishes to lead them far astray<sup>25</sup>.","[24] (V.4:60) Tâghût: See the footnote of (V.2:256)\n[25] (V.4:60) This verse was revealed in connection with a hypocrite claiming to be a Muslim, who had a dispute with a Jew and he wanted to take his case to a soothsayer rather than to the Prophet (Muhammad صلى الله عليه (وسلم for judgement - For details, see Tafsir At- Tabari."
  4,61,"And when it is said to them: ""Come to what Allâh has sent down and to the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم),"" you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) see the hypocrites turn away from you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) with aversion.",""
  4,62,"How then, when a catastrophe befalls them because of what their hands have sent forth, they come to you swearing by Allâh, ""We meant no more than goodwill and conciliation!""",""
  4,63,"They (hypocrites) are those of whom Allâh knows what is in their hearts; so turn aside from them (do not punish them) but admonish them, and speak to them an effective word (i.e. to believe in Allâh, worship Him, obey Him, and be afraid of Him) to reach their innerselves.",""
  4,64,"We sent no Messenger, but to be obeyed by Allâh’s Leave. If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and begged Allâh’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allâh All-Forgiving (One Who forgives and accepts repentance), Most Merciful.",""
  4,65,"But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.",""
