quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,70,"They said, ""Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us what it is. Verily, to us all cows are alike. And surely, if Allâh wills, we will be guided.""",""
  2,71,"He [Mûsâ (Moses)] said, ""He says, ‘It is a cow neither trained to till the soil nor water the fields, sound, having no other colour except bright yellow.’ "" They said, ""Now you have brought the truth."" So they slaughtered it though they were near to not doing it.",""
  2,72,"And (remember) when you killed a man and fell into dispute among yourselves as to the crime. But Allâh brought forth that which you were hiding.",""
  2,73,"So We said: ""Strike him (the dead man) with a piece of it (the cow)."" Thus Allâh brings the dead to life and shows you His Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) so that you may understand.",""
  2,74,"Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness. And indeed, there are stones out of which rivers gush forth, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which split asunder so that water flows from them, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which fall down for fear of Allâh. And Allâh is not unaware of what you do.",""
  2,75,"Do you (faithful believers) covet that they will believe in your religion inspite of the fact that a party of them (Jewish rabbis) used to hear the Word of Allâh [the Taurât (Torah)], then they used to change it knowingly after they understood it?",""
  2,76,"And when they (Jews) meet those who believe (Muslims), they say, ""We believe"", but when they meet one another in private, they say, ""Shall you (Jews) tell them (Muslims) what Allâh has revealed to you [Jews, about the description and the qualities of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, that which are written in the Taurât (Torah)]<sup>17</sup>, that they (Muslims) may argue with you (Jews) about it before your Lord?"" Have you (Jews) then no understanding?","[17] (V.2:76) See the footnote of (V.2:42)"
