quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,7,"How can there be a covenant with Allâh and with His Messenger for the Mushrikûn (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh) except those with whom you made a covenant near Al-Masjid-al-Harâm (at Makkah)? So long as they are true to you, stand you true to them. Verily, Allâh loves Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2).",""
  9,8,"How (can there be such a covenant with them) that when you are overpowered by them, they regard not the ties, either of kinship or of covenant with you? With (good words from) their mouths they please you, but their hearts are averse to you, and most of them are Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh).",""
  9,9,"They have purchased with the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh a little gain, and they hindered men from His Way; evil indeed is that which they used to do.",""
  9,10,"With regard to a believer, they respect not the ties, either of kinship or of covenant! It is they who are the transgressors.",""
  9,11,"But if they repent, perform As-Salât, (Iqâmat-as-Salât) and give Zakât,<sup>2</sup> then they are your brethren in religion. (In this way) We explain the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in detail for a people who know.","[2] (V.9:11) See the footnote of (V.9:5)."
  9,12,"But if they violate their oaths after their covenant, and attack your religion with disapproval and criticism, then fight (you) the leaders of disbelief (chiefs of Quraish pagans of Makkah) - for surely their oaths are nothing to them - so that they may stop (evil actions).",""
  9,13,"Will you not fight a people who have violated their oaths (pagans of Makkah), and intended to expel the Messenger while they did attack you first? Do you fear them? Allâh has more right that you should fear Him if you are believers.",""
