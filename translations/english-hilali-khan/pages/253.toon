quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  13,29,"Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism), and work righteousness, Tûbâ (all kinds of happiness or name of a tree in Paradise) is for them and a beautiful place of (final) return.",""
  13,30,"Thus have We sent you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to a community before whom other communities have passed away, in order that you might recite unto them what We have revealed to you, while they disbelieve in the Most Gracious (Allâh) Say: ""He is my Lord! Lâ ilâha illâ Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He)! In Him is my trust, and to Him will be my return with repentance.""",""
  13,31,"And if there had been a Qur’ân with which mountains could be moved (from their places), or the earth could be cloven asunder, or the dead could be made to speak (it would not have been other than this Qur’ân). But the decision of all things is certainly with Allâh. Have not then those who believed yet known that had Allâh willed, He could have guided all mankind? And a disaster will not cease to strike those who disbelieved because of their (evil) deeds or it (i.e. the disaster) settles close to their homes, until the Promise of Allâh comes to pass. Certainly, Allâh breaks not His Promise.",""
  13,32,"And indeed (many) Messengers were mocked at before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم), but I granted respite to those who disbelieved, and finally I punished them. Then how (terrible) was My punishment!",""
  13,33,"Is then He (Allâh) Who takes charge (guards, maintains, provides) of every person and knows all that he has earned (like any other deities who know nothing)? Yet, they ascribe partners to Allâh. Say: ""Name them! Is it that you will inform Him of something He knows not in the earth or is it (just) a show of false words."" Nay! To those who disbelieved, their plotting is made fairseeming, and they have been hindered from the Right Path; and whom Allâh sends astray, for him there is no guide.",""
  13,34,"For them is a torment in the life of this world, and certainly, harder is the torment of the Hereafter. And they have no Wâq (defender or protector) against Allâh.",""
