  21,25,"And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) but We revealed to him (saying): Lâ ilâha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allâh)], so worship Me (Alone and none else).""",""
  21,26,"And they say: ""The Most Gracious (Allâh) has begotten a son (or children)."" Glory to Him! They [whom they call children of Allâh i.e. the angels, ‘Îsâ (Jesus) - son of Maryam (Mary), ‘Uzair (Ezra)], are but honoured slaves.",""
  21,27,"They speak not until He has spoken, and they act on His Command.",""

  21,29,"And if any of them should say: ""Verily, I am an ilâh (a god) besides Him (Allâh),"" such a one We should recompense with Hell. Thus We recompense the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).",""
