Their hearts will be as if the heart of a single man for they will have neither difference nor any enmity amongst themselves, and everyone of them shall have two wives, each of whom will be so beautiful, pure and transparent that the marrow of the bones of their legs will be seen through the flesh. They will be glorifying Allâh in the morning and afternoon, and will never fall ill, and they will neither blow their noses nor spit.
