  9,118,"And (He did forgive also) the three [who did not join the Tabûk expedition whose case was deferred (by the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم)] (for Allâh’s Decision) till for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened and their ownselves were straitened to them, and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allâh, and no refuge but with Him. Then, He forgave them (accepted their repentance), that they might beg for His pardon [repent (unto Him)] Verily, Allâh is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful.",""
  9,119,"O you who believe! Be afraid of Allâh, and be with those who are true (in words and deeds).<sup>25</sup>","[25] (V.9:119) The Statement of Allâh تعالى : ‘O you who believe! Be afraid of Allâh, and be with those who are true (in words and deeds).’ (V.9:119).\nAnd what is forbidden as regards telling of lies.\na) Narrated ‘Abdullâh رضي الله عنه : The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Truthfulness leads to Al-Birr (righteousness) and Al-Birr (righteousness) leads to Paradise. And a man keeps on telling the truth until he becomes a truthful person. Falsehood leads to Al-Fujûr (i.e. wickedness - evil-doing), and Al-Fujûr leads to the (Hell) Fire, and a man keeps on telling lies until he is written as a liar before Allâh."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.8, Hadîth No.116).\nb) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""The signs of a hypocrite are three: Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie; and whenever he promises, he breaks his promise; and whenever he is entrusted, he betrays (proves to be dishonest)."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.117).\nc) Narrated Samurah bin Jundub رضي الله عنه : The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""I saw (in a dream), two men came to me."" Then the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم narrated the story (saying): ""They said: The person, the one whose cheek you saw being torn away (from the mouth to the ear) was a liar and used to tell lies and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.118)."
  9,120,"It was not becoming of the people of Al-Madinah and the bedouins of the neighbourhood to remain behind Allâh’s Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم when fighting in Allâh’s Cause) and (it was not becoming of them) to prefer their own lives to his life. That is because they suffer neither thirst nor fatigue, nor hunger in the Cause of Allâh, nor they take any step to raise the anger of disbelievers nor inflict any injury upon an enemy but is written to their credit as a deed of righteousness. Surely, Allâh wastes not the reward of the Muhsinûn <sup>26</sup>","[26] (V.9:120) Muhsinûn: Doers of good, i.e. those who perform good deeds totally for Allâh’s sake only without any show-off or to gain praise or fame, etc., and they do them in accordance with the Sunnah (legal ways) of Allâh’s Messenger, Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم."
  9,121,"Nor do they spend anything (in Allâh’s Cause) - small or great - nor cross a valley, but is written to their credit that Allâh may recompense them with the best of what they used to do (i.e. Allâh will reward their good deeds according to the reward of their best deeds which they did in the most perfect manner).<sup>27</sup>","[27] (V.9:121)\na) Islâm demolishes all the previous evil deeds and so do migration (for Allâh’s sake) and Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah).

(Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.1, Hadith No. 40A)\nNarrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""If anyone of you improves (follow strictly) his Islâmic religion, then his good deeds will be rewarded ten times to seven hundred times for each good deed and a bad deed will be recorded as it is."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.1, Hadith No.4DB)"
  9,122,"And it is not (proper) for the believers to go out to fight (Jihâd ) all together. Of every troop of them, a party only should go forth, that they (who are left behind) may get instructions in (Islâmic) religion, and that they may warn their people when they return to them, so that they may beware (of evil).",""
