quran[10]{c,v,t,f}:
  39,22,"Is he whose breast Allâh has opened to Islâm, so that he is in light from His Lord (as he who is a non-Muslim)? So woe to those whose hearts are hardened against remembrance of Allâh! They are in plain error!",""
  39,23,"Allâh has sent down the Best Statement, a Book (this Qur’ân), its parts resembling each other (in goodness and truth) (and) oft-repeated. The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver from it (when they recite it or hear it). Then their skin and their heart soften to the remembrance of Allâh. That is the guidance of Allâh. He Guides therewith whom He wills; and whomever Allâh sends astray, for him there is no guide.",""
  39,24,"Is he then, who will confront with his face the awful torment on the Day of Resurrection (as he who enters peacefully in Paradise)? And it will be said to the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers): ""Taste what you used to earn!""",""
  39,25,"Those before them belied, and so the torment came on them from directions they perceived not.",""
  39,26,"So Allâh made them to taste the disgrace in the present life, but greater is the torment of the Hereafter if they only knew!",""
  39,27,"And indeed We have put forth for men, in this Qur’ân every kind of similitude in order that they may remember.",""
  39,28,"An Arabic Qur’ân, without any crookedness (therein) in order that they may avoid all evil which Allâh has ordered them to avoid, fear Him and keep their duty to Him.",""
  39,29,"Allâh puts forth a similitude: a (slave) man belonging to many partners (like those who worship others along with Allâh) disputing with one another, and a (slave) man belonging entirely to one master (like those who worship Allâh Alone). Are those two equal in comparison? All the praises and thanks be to Allâh! But most of them know not.",""
  39,30,"Verily you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will die, and verily they (too) will die.",""
  39,31,"Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will be disputing before your Lord.",""
