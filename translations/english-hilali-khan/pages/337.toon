  22,41,"Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) enjoin Iqamat-as-Salât<sup>8</sup> [i.e. to perform the five compulsory congregational Salât (prayers) (the males in mosques)], to pay the Zakât and they enjoin Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism and all that Islâm has forbidden) [i.e. they make the Qur’ân as the law of their country in all the spheres of life]. And with Allâh rests the end of (all) matters (of creatures).","[8] (V.22:41):\nA) Iqâmat-as-Salât: Performing of Salât (prayers) It means that:\na) Every Muslim, male or female, is obliged to offer his Salât (prayers) regularly five times a day at the specified times; the male in the mosque in congregation and the female at home. As the Prophetصلى الله عليه وسلم has said: Order your children to perform Salât (prayer) at the age of seven and beat them (about it) at the age of ten. The chief (of a family, town, tribe, etc.) and the Muslim rulers of a country are held responsible before Allâh in case of non-fulfilment of this obligation by the Muslims under their authority.\nb) One must offer the Salât (prayers) as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم used to offer them with all their rules and regulations. i.e., standing, bowing, prostrating, sitting, etc. As he صلى الله عليه وسلم has said: ""Offer your Salât (prayers) the way you see me offering them (Hadîth No.352, Vol. 9, Sahih Al-Bukhârî)."" [For the characteristics of the Salât (prayer) of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم see Sahih Al-Bukhârî, Vol.1, Hadîth Nos. 702, 703,704, 723, 786 and 787].\nB) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""No Salât (prayer) is heavier (harder) for the hypocrites than the Fajr and the ‘Ishâ prayers, but if they knew the reward for these Salât (prayers) at their respective times, they would certainly present themselves (in the mosques) even if they had to crawl."" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, ""Certainly, I intended (or was about) to order the Mu’adhdhin (call-maker) to pronounce Iqâmah and order a man to lead the Salât (prayer) and then take a fire flame to burn all those (men along with their houses) who had not yet left their houses for the Salât (prayer) (in the mosques).""
