quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,187,"(And remember) when Allâh took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) to make it (the news of the coming of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and the religious knowledge) known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it, but they threw it away behind their backs, and purchased with it some miserable gain! And indeed worst is that which they bought.",""
  3,188,"Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done, - think not you that they are rescued from the torment, and for them is a painful torment.",""
  3,189,"And to Allâh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allâh has power over all things.",""
  3,190,"Verily! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding.",""
  3,191,"Those who remember Allâh (always, and in prayers) standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and think deeply about the creation of the heavens and the earth, (saying): ""Our Lord! You have not created (all) this without purpose, glory to You! (Exalted are You above all that they associate with You as partners). Give us salvation from the torment of the Fire.",""
  3,192,"""Our Lord! Verily, whom You admit to the Fire, indeed, You have disgraced him; and never will the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) find any helpers.",""
  3,193,"""Our Lord! Verily, we have heard the call of one (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) calling to Faith: ‘Believe in your Lord,’ and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and expiate from us our evil deeds, and make us die (in the state of righteousness) along with Al-Abrâr (the pious believers of Islamic Monotheism).",""
  3,194,"""Our Lord! Grant us what You promised unto us through Your Messengers and disgrace us not on the Day of Resurrection, for You never break (Your) Promise.""",""
