  12,87,"""O my sons! Go you and enquire about Yûsuf (Joseph) and his brother, and never give up hope of Allâh’s Mercy. Certainly no one despairs of Allâh’s Mercy, except the people who disbelieve.""",""
  12,88,"Then, when they entered unto him [Yûsuf (Joseph)], they said: ""O ruler of the land! A hard time has hit us and our family, and we have brought but poor capital, so pay us full measure and be charitable to us. Truly, Allâh does reward the charitable.""",""
  12,89,"He said: ""Do you know what you did with Yûsuf (Joseph) and his brother, when you were ignorant?""",""
  12,90,"They said: ""Are you indeed Yûsuf (Joseph)?"" He said: ""I am Yûsuf (Joseph), and this is my brother (Benjamin). Allâh has indeed been gracious to us. Verily, he who fears Allâh with obedience to Him (by abstaining from sins and evil deeds, and by performing righteous good deeds), and is patient, then surely, Allâh makes not the reward of the Muhsinûn (good-doers - see V.2:112) to be lost.""",""
  12,91,"They said: ""By Allâh! Indeed Allâh has preferred you above us, and we certainly have been sinners.""",""
  12,92,"He said: ""No reproach on you this day; may Allâh forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!<sup>4</sup>","[4] (V.12:92) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, ""Verily Allâh created mercy. The day He created it, He made it into one hundred parts. He withheld with Him ninety-nine parts, and sent its one part to all His creatures. Had a disbeliever known of all the mercy which is in the Hands of Allâh, he would not have lost hope of entering Paradise, and had a believer known of all the punishment which is present with Allâh, he would not have considered himself safe from the Hell-fire."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.476)."
  12,93,"""Go with this shirt of mine, and cast it over the face of my father, he will become clear-sighted, and bring me all your family.""",""

  12,95,"They said: ""By Allâh! Certainly, you are in your old error.""",""
