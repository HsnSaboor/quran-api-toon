  13,1,"Alif-Lâm-Mîm-Râ.
[These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur’an; and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings].These are the Verses of the Book (the Qur’an), and that which has been revealed unto you (Muhammad ﷺ) from your Lord is the truth, out most men believe not.",""
  13,2,"Allâh is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see. Then, He rose above (Istawâ) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty). He has subjected the sun and the moon (to continue going round), each running (its course) for a term appointed. He manages and regulates all affairs; He explains the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in detail, that you may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord.",""
  13,3,"And it is He Who spread out the earth, and placed therein firm mountains and rivers and of every kind of fruits He made Zawjain Ithnaîn (two in pairs - may mean two kinds or it may mean: of two varieties, e.g. black and white, sweet and sour, small and big). He brings the night as a cover over the day. Verily, in these things, there are Ayât (proofs, evidence, lessons, signs, etc.) for people who reflect.",""
  13,4,"And in the earth are neighbouring tracts, and gardens of vines, and green crops (fields), and date-palms, growing into two or three from a single stem root, or otherwise (one stem root for every palm), watered with the same water; yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat. Verily, in these things there are Ayât (proofs, evidence, lessons, signs) for the people who understand.",""
  13,5,"And if you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) wonder (at these polytheists who deny your message of Islâmic Monotheism and have taken besides Allâh others for worship who can neither harm nor benefit), then wondrous is their saying: ""When we are dust, shall we indeed then be (raised) in a new creation?"" They are those who disbelieved in their Lord! They are those who will have iron chains tying their hands to their necks. They will be the dwellers of the Fire to abide therein.",""
