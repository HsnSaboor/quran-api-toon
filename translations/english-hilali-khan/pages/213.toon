  10,34,"Say: ""Is there of your (Allâh’s called) partners one that originates the creation and then repeats it?"" Say: ""Allâh originates the creation and then He repeats it. Then how are you deluded away (from the truth)?""",""
  10,35,"Say: ""Is there of your (Allâh’s so-called) partners one that guides to the truth?"" Say: ""It is Allâh Who guides to the truth. Is then He Who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed, or he who finds not guidance (himself) unless he is guided? Then, what is the matter with you? How judge you?""",""
  10,36,"And most of them follow nothing but conjecture. Certainly, conjecture can be of no avail against the truth. Surely, Allâh is All-Aware of what they do.",""
  10,37,"And this Qur’ân is not such as could ever be produced by other than Allâh (Lord of the heavens and the earth), but it is a confirmation of (the revelation)<sup>8</sup> which was before it [i.e. the Taurât (Torah), and the Injeel (Gospel)], and a full explanation of the Book (i.e. laws, decreed for mankind) - wherein there is no doubt - from the Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn, and all that exists).","[8] (V.10:37) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""There was no Prophet among the Prophets but was given miracles because of which people had security or had belief, but what I have been given is the Divine Revelation which Allâh has revealed to me. So I hope that my followers will be more than those of any other Prophet on the Day of Resurrection."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.9, Hadith No.379)."
  10,38,"Or do they say: ""He (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) has forged it?"" Say: ""Bring then a Sûrah (chapter) like unto it, and call upon whomsoever you can besides Allâh, if you are truthful!""",""
  10,39,"Nay, they have belied the knowledge whereof they could not comprehend and what has not yet been fulfilled (i.e. their punishment). Thus those before them did belie. Then see what was the end of the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers)!",""
  10,40,"And of them there are some who believe therein; and of them there are some who believe not therein, and your Lord is All-Aware of the Mufsidûn (evil-doers, liars).",""
  10,41,"And if they belie you, say: ""For me are my deeds and for you are your deeds! You are innocent of what I do, and I am innocent of what you do!""",""
  10,42,"And among them are some who listen to you, but can you make the deaf to hear - even though they apprehend not?",""
