  30,17,"So glorify Allâh [above all that (evil) they associate with Him (O believers)] when you come up to the evening [i.e. offer the (Maghrib ) sunset and (‘Ishâ’) night prayers], and when you enter the morning [i.e. offer the (Fajr) morning prayer].",""
  30,18,"And His are all the praises and thanks in the heavens and the earth; and (glorify Him) in the afternoon (i.e. offer ‘Asr prayer) and when you come up to the time, when the day begins to decline (i.e. offer Zuhr prayer). (Ibn ‘Abbâs said: ""These are the five compulsory congregational prayers mentioned in the Qur’ân)."" [Tafsir At-Tabari]",""
  30,19,"He brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from the living. And He revives the earth after its death. And thus shall you be brought out (resurrected).",""
  30,20,"And among His Signs is this, that He created you (Adam) from dust, and then [Hawwâ’ (Eve) from Adam’s rib, and then his offspring from the semen, and], - behold you are human beings scattered!",""

Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who listen.","[1] (V.30:23) It is a sign from among the Signs of Allah that a person goes to sleep; the medical world up to now does not know exactly why a person goes to sleep. There are only theories. So this Qur’ân is a miracle from Allah, and not an invented tale as the disbelievers (in the Oneness of Allah) argue."
  30,24,"And among His Signs is that He shows you the lightning, for fear and for hope, and He sends down water (rain) from the sky, and therewith revives the earth after its death. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who understand.",""
