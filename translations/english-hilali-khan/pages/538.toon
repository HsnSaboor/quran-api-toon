And Allâh is the All-Seer of what you do.",""
  57,5,"His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And to Allâh return all the matters (for decision).",""
  57,6,"He merges night into day (i.e. the decrease in the hours of the night is added into the hours of the day), and merges day into night (i.e. the decrease in the hours of the day is added into the hours of the night), and He has full knowledge of whatsoever is in the breasts.",""
  57,7,"Believe in Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and spend of that whereof He has made you trustees.<sup>1</sup> And such of you as believe and spend (in Allâh’s Way), theirs will be a great reward.","[1] (V.57:7) See the footnote of (V.4:37)."

  57,10,"And what is the matter with you that you spend not in the Cause of Allâh? And to Allâh belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth. Not equal among you are those who spent and fought before the conquering (of Makkah, with those among you who did so later). Such are higher in degree than those who spent and fought afterwards. But to all Allâh has promised the best (reward). And Allâh is All-Aware of what you do.",""
