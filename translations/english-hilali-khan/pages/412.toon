  31,12,"And indeed We bestowed upon Luqmân Al-Hikmah (wisdom and religious understanding) saying: ""Give thanks to Allâh."" And whoever gives thanks, he gives thanks for (the good of) his ownself. And whoever is unthankful, then verily, Allâh is All-Rich (Free of all needs), Worthy of all praise.",""
  31,13,"And (remember) when Luqmân said to his son when he was advising him: ""O my son! Join not in worship others with Allâh. Verily joining others in worship with Allâh is a great Zûlm (wrong) indeed.<sup>4</sup>","[4] (V.31:13)\na) See the footnote (C) of (V.27:59).\nb) See the footnote of (V.2:22)."
  31,14,"And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years - give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination.<sup>5</sup>","[5] (V.31:14).\na) See the footnote of (V.17:13).\nb) Narrated ‘Âishah رضي الله عنها: (that she said), ""O Allâh’s Messenger!

Aqim-As-Salât (perform As-Salât), enjoin (on people) Al-Ma‘rûf - (Islâmic Monotheism and all that is good), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief in the Oneness of Allâh, polytheism of all kinds and all that is evil and bad), and bear with patience whatever befalls you.
