quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,164,"And when a community among them said: ""Why do you preach to a people whom Allâh is about to destroy or to punish with a severe torment?"" (The preachers) said: ""In order to be free from guilt before your Lord (Allâh), and perhaps they may fear Allâh.""",""
  7,165,"So when they forgot the remindings that had been given to them, We rescued those who forbade evil, but We seized those who did wrong with a severe torment because they used to rebel against Allâh’s Command (disobey Allâh).",""
  7,166,"So when they exceeded the limits of what they were prohibited, We said to them: ""Be you monkeys, despised and rejected.""<sup>13</sup>","[13] (V.7:166) It is a severe warning to the mankind that they should not disobey what Allâh commands them to do, and keep far away from what He prohibits them.*\n* See the footnote of (V.9: 112)."
  7,167,"And (remember) when your Lord declared that He would certainly keep on sending against them (i.e. the Jews), till the Day of Resurrection, those who would afflict them with a humiliating torment. Verily, your Lord is Quick in Retribution (for the disobedient, wicked) and certainly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful (for the obedient and those who beg Allâh’s Forgiveness).",""
  7,168,"And We have broken them (i.e. the Jews) up into various separate groups on the earth: some of them are righteous and some are away from that. And We tried them with good (blessings) and evil (calamities) in order that they might turn (to Allâh’s Obedience).",""
  7,169,"Then after them succeeded an (evil) generation, which inherited the Book, but they chose (for themselves) the goods of this low life (evil pleasures of this world) saying (as an excuse): ""(Everything) will be forgiven to us."" And if (again) the offer of the like (evil pleasures of this world) came their way, they would (again) seize them (would commit those sins). Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not say about Allâh anything but the truth? And they have studied what is in it (the Book). And the home of the Hereafter is better for those who are Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2). Do not you then understand?",""
  7,170,"And as to those who hold fast to the Book (i.e. act on its teachings) and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât ), certainly We shall never waste the reward of those who do righteous deeds.",""
