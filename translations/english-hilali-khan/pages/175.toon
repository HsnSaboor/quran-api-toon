quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,188,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""I possess no power over benefit or harm to myself except as Allâh wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe.""",""
  7,189,"It is He Who has created you from a single person (Adam), and (then) He has created from him his wife [Hawwâ’ (Eve)], in order that he might enjoy the pleasure of living with her. When he (a polytheist from Adam’s offspring - as stated by Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir) had sexual relation with her (the polytheist’s wife), she became pregnant and she carried it about lightly. Then when it became heavy, they both invoked Allâh, their Lord (saying): ""If You give us a Sâlih (good in every aspect) child, we shall indeed be among the grateful.""",""
  7,190,"But when He gave them (the polytheist and his wife) a Sâlih (good in every aspect) child, they ascribed partners to Him (Allâh) in that which He has given to them. High be Allâh, Exalted above all that they ascribe as partners to Him. (Tafsir Ibn Kathir).",""
  7,191,"Do they attribute as partners to Allâh those who created nothing but they themselves are created?",""
  7,192,"No help can they give them, nor can they help themselves.",""
  7,193,"And if you call them to guidance, they follow you not. It is the same for you whether you call them or you keep silent.",""
  7,194,"Verily, those whom you call upon besides Allâh are slaves like you. So call upon them and let them answer you if you are truthful.",""
  7,195,"Have they feet wherewith they walk? Or have they hands wherewith they hold? Or have they eyes wherewith they see? Or have they ears wherewith they hear? Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""Call your (so-called) partners (of Allâh) and then plot against me, and give me no respite!",""
