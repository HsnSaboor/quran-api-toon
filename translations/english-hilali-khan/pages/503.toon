  46,6,"And when mankind are gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.",""
  46,7,"And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, the disbelievers say of the truth (this Qur’ân) when it reaches them: ""This is plain magic!""",""
  46,8,"Or say they: ""He (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) has fabricated it."" Say: ""If I have fabricated it? still you have no power to support me against Allâh. He knows best of what you say among yourselves concerning it (i.e. this Qur’ân)! Sufficient is He as a witness between me and you! And He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.""",""
  46,9,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""I am not a new thing among the Messengers (of Allâh i.e. I am not the first Messenger) nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow that which is revealed to me, and I am but a plain warner.""",""
  46,10,"Say: ""Tell me! If this (Qur’ân) is from Allâh and you deny it, and a witness from among the Children of Israel (‘Abdullâh bin Salâm رضي الله عنه) testifies that [this Qur’ân is from Allâh (like the Taurât (Torah)], and he believed (embraced Islâm)<sup>2</sup> while you are too proud (to believe)."" Verily, Allâh guides not the people who are Zâlimûn (polytheists, disbelievers and wrong-doers).","[2] (V.46:10) See the footnote of (V.5:66)."
  46,11,"And those who disbelieve (the strong and wealthy) say of those who believe (the weak and poor): ""Had it (Islâmic Monotheism to which Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is inviting mankind) been a good thing, they (the weak and poor) would not have preceded us thereto!"" And when they have not let themselves be guided by it (this Qur’ân), they say: ""This is an ancient lie!""",""
  46,12,"And before this was the Scripture of Mûsâ (Moses) as a guide and a mercy. And this is a confirming Book (the Qur’ân) in the Arabic language, to warn those who do wrong, and as glad tidings to the Muhsinûn (good-doers. See the footnote of V.9:120).",""
  46,13,"Verily, those who say: ""Our Lord is (only) Allâh,"" and thereafter stand firm and straight on the Islâmic Faith of Monotheism,<sup>3</sup> on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.","[3] (V.46:13): stand firm on the Islamic Monotheism i.e. by abstaining from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which Allâh has forbidden and by performing all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained.

  46,14,"Such shall be the dwellers of Paradise, abiding therein (forever) - a reward for what they used to do.",""
