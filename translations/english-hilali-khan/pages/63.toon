  3,101,"And how would you disbelieve, while unto you are recited the Verses of Allâh, and among you is His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)? And whoever holds firmly to Allâh, (i.e. follows Islâm - Allâh’s Religion, and obeys all that Allâh has ordered, practically), then he is indeed guided to the Right Path.",""
  3,102,"O you who believe! Fear Allâh (by doing all that He has ordered and by abstaining from all that He has forbidden) as He should be feared. [Obey Him, be thankful to Him, and remember Him always], and die not except in a state of Islâm [as Muslims (with complete submission to Allâh)].",""
  3,103,"And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allâh (i.e. this Qur’ân), and be not divided among yourselves<sup>20</sup>, and remember Allâh’s Favour on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His Grace, you became brethren (in Islâmic Faith), and you were on the brink of a pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus Allâh makes His Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.,) clear to you, that you may be guided.","[20] (V.3:103) It has been narrated by Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه in the Hadîth Books (At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Mâjah and Abu Dâwûd) that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""The Jews and Christians were divided into seventy-one or seventy-two religious sects, and this nation will be divided into seventy-three religious sects - all in Hell, except one, and that one is the one on which I and my Companions are today [i.e. following the Qur’ân and the Prophet’s Sunnah (legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)]."""
  3,104,"Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islâm), enjoining Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do) and forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islâm has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful.",""
  3,105,"And be not as those who divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them. It is they for whom there is an awful torment.",""
  3,106,"On the Day (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) when some faces will become white and some faces will become black; as for those whose faces will become black (to them will be said): ""Did you reject Faith after accepting it? Then taste the torment (in Hell) for rejecting Faith.""",""
  3,107,"And for those whose faces will become white, they will be in Allâh’s Mercy (Paradise), therein they shall dwell forever.",""
  3,108,"These are the Verses of Allâh: We recite them to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) in truth, and Allâh wills no injustice to the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists).",""
