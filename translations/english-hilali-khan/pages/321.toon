quran[10]{c,v,t,f}:
  20,126,"(Allâh) will say: ""Like this: Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) came unto you, but you disregarded them (i.e. you left them, did not think deeply in them, and you turned away from them), and so this Day, you will be neglected (in the Hell-fire, away from Allâh’s Mercy).""",""
  20,127,"And thus do We requite him who transgresses beyond bounds [i.e. commits the great sins and disobeys his Lord (Allâh) and believes not in His Messengers, and His revealed Books, like this Qur’an], and believes not in the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his Lord; and the torment of the Hereafter is far more severe and more lasting.",""
  20,128,"Is it not a guidance for them (to know) how many generations We have destroyed before them, in whose dwellings they walk? Verily, in this are signs indeed for men of understanding.",""
  20,129,"And had it not been for a Word that went forth before from your Lord, and a term determined, (their punishment) must necessarily have come (in this world).",""
  20,130,"So bear patiently (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) what they say, and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before its setting, and during some hours of the night, and at the ends of the day (an indication for the five compulsory congregational prayers), that you may become pleased (with the reward which Allâh shall give you).",""
  20,131,"And strain not your eyes in longing for the things We have given for enjoyment to various groups of them (polytheists and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh), the splendour of the life of this world, that We may test them thereby. But the provision (good reward in the Hereafter) of your Lord is better and more lasting.",""
  20,132,"And enjoin As-Salât (the prayer) on your family, and be patient in offering them [i.e. the Salât (prayers)]. We ask not of you a provision (i.e. to give Us something: money): We provide for you. And the good end (i.e. Paradise) is for the Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2).",""
  20,133,"They say: ""Why does he not bring us a sign (proof) from his Lord?"" Has there not come to them the proof of that which is (written) in the former papers [Scriptures, i.e. the Taurât (Torah), and the Injeel (Gospel), about the coming of the Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم]?",""
  20,134,"And if We had destroyed them with a torment before this (i.e. Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and the Qur’ân), they would surely have said: ""Our Lord! If only You had sent us a Messenger, we should certainly have followed Your Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), before we were humiliated and disgraced.""<sup>7</sup>","[7] (V.20:134) Narrated Abu Sa‘îd Al-Khudrî رضي الله عنه: ‘Alî bin Abî Tâlib sent a piece of gold, not yet taken out of its ore, in a tanned leather container to Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم . Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم distributed that amongst four persons: ‘Uyainah bin Badr, Aqra‘ bin Hâbis, Zaid Al-Khail and the fourth was either ‘Alqamah or ‘Âmir bin At-Tufail. On that, one of his companions said, ""We are more deserving of this (gold) than these (persons)."" When that news reached the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم he said, ""Don’t you trust me though I am the trustworthy man of the One in the heavens, and I receive the news of heavens (i.e. Divine Revelation) both in the morning and in the evening?"" There got up a man with sunken eyes, raised cheek bones, raised forehead, a thick beard, a shaven head and a waist-sheet that was tucked up and he said, ""O Allâh’s Messenger! Be afraid of Allâh."" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Woe to you! Am I not of all the people of the earth the most entitled to fear Allâh?"" Then that man went away. Khâlid bin Al-Walîd said, ""O Allâh’s Messenger! Shall I chop his neck off?"" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""No, may be he offers prayers."" Khâlid said, ""Numerous are those who offer prayers and say by their tongues (i.e. mouths) what is not in their hearts."" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""I have not been ordered (by Allâh) to search the hearts of the people or cut open their bellies."" Then the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم looked at him (i.e. that man) while the latter was going away and said, ""From the offspring of this (man) there will come out (people) who will recite the Qur’ân continuously and elegantly but it will not exceed their throats. (They will neither understand it nor act upon it). They would go out of the religion (i.e., discard Islâm) as an arrow goes out through a game’s body."" I think he also said, ""If I should be present at their time, I would kill them as the nations of Thamûd were killed."" [Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.5, Hadith No.638]."
  20,135,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""Each one (believer and disbeliever.) is waiting, so wait you too; and you shall know who are they that are on the Straight and Even Path (i.e. Allâh’s religion of Islâmic Monotheism), and who are they that have let themselves be guided (on the Right Path).",""
