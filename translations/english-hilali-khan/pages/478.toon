quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  41,12,"Then He completed and finished from their creation (as) seven heavens in two Days and He made in each heaven its affair. And We adorned the nearest (lowest) heaven with lamps (stars)<sup>1</sup> to be an adornment as well as to guard (from the devils by using them as missiles against the devils). Such is the Decree of Him the All-Mighty, the All-Knower.","[1] (V.41:12) See the footnote of (V.6:97)."
  41,13,"But if they turn away, then say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""I have warned you of a Sâ‘iqah (a destructive awful cry, torment, hit, a thunderbolt) like the Sâ‘iqah which overtook ‘Âd and Thamûd (people).""",""
  41,14,"When the Messengers came to them, from before them and behind them (saying): ""Worship none but Allâh"", they said: ""If our Lord had so willed, He would surely have sent down the angels. So indeed we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.""",""
  41,15,"As for ‘Âd, they were arrogant in the land without right, and they said: ""Who is mightier than us in strength?"" See they not that Allâh, Who created them was mightier in strength than them. And they used to deny Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, revelations, etc.)!",""
  41,16,"So We sent upon them a furious wind in days of evil omen (for them) that We might give them a taste of disgracing torment in this present worldly life. But surely the torment of the Hereafter will be more disgracing, and they will never be helped.",""
  41,17,"And as for Thamûd, We showed and made clear to them the Path of Truth (Islâmic Monotheism) through Our Messenger, (i.e. showed them the way of success), but they preferred blindness to guidance; so the Sâ‘iqah (a destructive awful cry, torment, hit, a thunderbolt) of disgracing torment seized them because of what they used to earn.",""
  41,18,"And We saved those who believed and used to fear Allâh, keep their duty to Him and avoid evil.",""
  41,19,"And (remember) the Day that the enemies of Allâh will be gathered to the Fire, then they will be driven [(to the Fire), former ones being withheld till their later ones will join them].",""
  41,20,"Till, when they reach it (Hell-fire), their hearing (ears) and their eyes, and their skins will testify against them as to what they used to do.",""
