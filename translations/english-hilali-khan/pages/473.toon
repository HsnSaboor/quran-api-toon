  40,50,"They will say: ""Did there not come to you, your Messengers with (clear) evidence (and signs)?"" They will say: ""Yes."" They will reply: ""Then call (as you like)! And the invocation of the disbelievers is nothing but in vain (as it will not be answered by Allâh)!""",""
  40,51,"Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) in this world’s life and on the Day when the witnesses will stand forth, (i.e. Day of Resurrection) -",""
  40,52,"The Day when their excuses will be of no profit to Zâlimûn (polytheists, wrong-doers and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh). Theirs will be the curse, and theirs will be the evil abode (i.e. painful torment in Hell-fire).",""

They will never have it (i.e. Prophethood which Allâh has bestowed upon you). So seek refuge in Allâh (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم from the arrogants). Verily, it is He Who is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.","[4] (V.40:56) See the footnote of (V.3:85)."
