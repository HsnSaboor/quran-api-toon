quran[11]{c,v,t,f}:
  21,91,"And she who guarded her chastity [Virgin Maryam (Mary)]: We breathed into (the sleeves of) her (shirt or garment) [through Our Rûh - Jibrîl (Gabriel)],<sup>6</sup> and We made her and her son [‘Îsâ (Jesus)] a sign for Al-‘Âlamîn (the mankind and jinn).","[6] (V.21:91) It is said that Jibrael (Gabriel) had merely breathed in the sleeve of Maryam’s (Mary) shirt and thus she conceived."
  21,92,"Truly! This, your Ummah [Shari‘ah or religion (Islâmic Monotheism)] is one religion, and I am your Lord, therefore worship Me (Alone). [Tafsîr Ibn Kathîr]",""
  21,93,"But they have broken up and differed as regards their religion among themselves. (And) they all shall return to Us.",""
  21,94,"So whoever does righteous good deeds while he is a believer (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism), his efforts will not be rejected. Verily We record it for him (in his Book of deeds).<sup>7</sup>","[7] (V.21:94) See the footnote of (V.9:121)."
  21,95,"And a ban is laid on every town (population) which We have destroyed that they shall not return (to this world again, nor repent to Us).",""
  21,96,"Until, when Ya’jûj and Ma’jûj (Gog and Magog)<sup>8</sup> are let loose (from their barrier), and they swoop down from every mound.","[8] (V.21:96) See the footnote of (V.18:94)."
  21,97,"And the true promise (Day of Resurrection) shall draw near (of fulfillment). Then (when mankind is resurrected from their graves), you shall see the eyes of the disbelievers fixedly staring in horror. (They will say): ""Woe to us! We were indeed heedless of this - nay, but we were Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).""",""
  21,98,"Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allâh, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely), you will enter it.<sup>9</sup>","[9] (V.21:98) When the following Statement of Allâh عز وجل was revealed: ""Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allâh are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely), you will enter it.""\nThe Quraish pagans were delighted and said: ""We are pleased to be with our gods in the Hell-fire, as the idols will be with the idolaters (in the Hell-fire), and therefore ‘Îsâ (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary) will be with his worshippers (i.e. in the Hell-fire) and so on.\nSo (to clear the misunderstanding) Allâh عز وجل revealed the following Verse (to deny and reject their claim): ""Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell). [e.g. ‘Îsâ (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary); ‘Uzair (Ezra)]."" [The Qur’ân, Verse 21:101]."
  21,99,"Had these (idols) been âlihah (gods), they would not have entered there (Hell), and all of them will abide therein.",""
  21,100,"Therein they will be breathing out with deep sighs and roaring and therein they will hear not.<sup>10</sup>","[10] (V.21:100) Ibn Mas‘ûd رضي الله عنه recited this Verse and then said: ""When those (who are destined to remain in the Hell-fire forever) will be thrown in the Hell-fire, each of them will be put in a separate Tabût (box) of Fire, so that he will not see anyone punished in the Hell fire except himself."" Then Ibn Mas‘ûd recited this Verse (21:100). [Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Tabari and Qurtubî]."
  21,101,"Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell) [e.g. ‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary); ‘Uzair (Ezra)].",""
