  2,113,"The Jews said that the Christians follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); and the Christians said that the Jews follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); though they both recite the Scripture. Like unto their word, said (the pagans) who know not. Allâh will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they have been differing.",""
  2,114,"And who are more unjust than those who forbid that Allâh’s Name be glorified and mentioned much (i.e. prayers and invocations, etc.) in Allâh’s Mosques and strive for their ruin? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them (Allâh’s Mosques) except in fear. For them there is disgrace in this world, and they will have a great torment in the Hereafter.",""
  2,115,"And to Allâh belong the east and the west, so wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of Allâh (and He is High above, over His Throne). Surely! Allâh is All-Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All-Knowing.",""
  2,116,"And they (Jews, Christians and pagans) say: Allâh has begotten a son (children or offspring)<sup>22</sup>. Glory be to Him (Exalted be He above all that they associate with Him).

As for telling lies against Me, he claims that I cannot re-create him as I created him before; and as for his abusing Me: it is his statement that I have a son (or offspring) No! Glorified be Me! I am far from taking a wife or a son (or offspring).’ "" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 6, Hadîth No. 9)."

  2,118,"And those who have no knowledge say: ""Why does not Allâh speak to us (face to face) or why does not a sign come to us?"" So said the people before them words of similar import. Their hearts are alike, We have indeed made plain the signs for people who believe with certainty.",""
  2,119,"Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) with the truth (Islâm), a bringer of glad tidings (for those who believe in what you brought, that they will enter Paradise) and a warner (for those who disbelieve in what you brought, that they will enter the Hell-fire).<sup>23</sup> And you will not be asked about the dwellers of the blazing Fire.","[23] (V.2:119) See the footnote of (V.3:85)"
