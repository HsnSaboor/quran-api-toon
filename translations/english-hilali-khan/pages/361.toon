  25,12,"When it (Hell) sees them from a far place, they will hear its raging and its roaring.",""
  25,13,"And when they shall be thrown into a narrow place thereof, chained together, they will exclaim therein for destruction.",""
  25,14,"Exclaim not today for one destruction, but exclaim for many destructions.",""
  25,15,"Say: (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) ""Is that (torment) better or the Paradise of Ete - nity which is promised to the Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2)?"" It will be theirs as a reward and as a final destination.",""
  25,16,"For them there will be therein all that they desire, and they will abide (there forever). It is a promise binding upon your Lord that must be fulfilled.",""
  25,17,"And on the Day when He will gather them together and that which they worship besides Allâh [idols, angels, pious men, saints]<sup>1</sup>. He will say: ""Was it you who misled these My slaves or did they (themselves) stray from the (Right) Path?""","[1] (V.25:17) Narrated Mu‘âdh bin Jabal رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""O Mu‘âdh! Do you know what Allâh’s Right upon His slaves is?"" I said, ""Allâh and His Messenger know better."" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""To worship Him (Allâh) Alone and to join none in worship with Him (Allâh). Do you know what their right upon Him is?"" I replied, ""Allâh and His Messenger know better."" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Not to punish them (if they did so)."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 9, Hadith No. 470)."
  25,18,"They will say: ""Glorified be You! It was not for us to take any Auliyâ’ (Protectors, Helpers) besides You, but You gave them and their fathers comfort till they forgot the warning, and became a lost people (doomed to total loss).",""
  25,19,"Thus they (false gods - all deities other than Allâh) will belie you (polytheists) regarding what you say (that they are gods besides Allâh): then you can neither avert (the punishment), nor get help. And whoever among you does wrong (i.e. sets up rivals to Allâh), We shall make him taste a great torment.",""
  25,20,"And We never sent before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) any of the Messengers but verily, they ate food and walked in the markets. And We have made some of you as a trial for others: will you have patience? And your Lord is Ever All-Seer (of everything).",""
