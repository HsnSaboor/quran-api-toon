quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  28,29,"Then, when Mûsâ (Moses) had fulfilled the term, and was travelling with his family, he saw a fire in the direction of Tûr (Mount). He said to his family: ""Wait, I have seen a fire; perhaps I may bring you from there some information, or a burning fire-brand that you may warm yourselves.""",""
  28,30,"So when he reached it (the fire), he was called from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place, from the tree: ""O Mûsâ (Moses)! Verily I am Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists)!",""
  28,31,"""And throw your stick!"" But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight, and looked not back. (It was said:) ""O Mûsâ (Moses)! Draw near, and fear not. Verily, you are of those who are secure.",""
  28,32,"""Put your hand in your bosom, it will come forth white without a disease; and draw your hand close to your side to be free from the fear (which you suffered from the snake, and also your hand will return to its original state). These are two Burhâns (signs, miracles, evidence, proofs) from your Lord to Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his chiefs. Verily, they are the people who are Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh).",""
  28,33,"He said: ""My Lord! I have killed a man among them, and I fear that they will kill me.",""
  28,34,"""And my brother Hârûn (Aaron) - he is more eloquent in speech than me: so send him with me as a helper to confirm me. Verily I fear that they will belie me.""",""
  28,35,"Allâh said: ""We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power, so they shall not be able to harm you: with Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors.""",""
