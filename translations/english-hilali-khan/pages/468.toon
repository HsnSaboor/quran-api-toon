  40,8,"""Our Lord! And make them enter the ‘Adn (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens) which you have promised them - and to the righteous among their fathers, their wives, and their offspring! Verily, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.",""
  40,9,"""And save them from (the punishment, for what they did of) the sins, and whomsoever You save from (the punishment for what he did of) the sins (i.e. pardon him) that Day, him verily, You have taken into mercy."" And that is the supreme success.",""
  40,10,"Those who disbelieve will be addressed (at the time of entering the Fire): ""Allâh’s aversion was greater towards you (in the worldly life when you used to reject the Faith) than your aversion towards one another (now in the Fire of Hell, as you are now enemies to one another), when you were called to the Faith but you used to refuse.""",""
  40,11,"They will say: ""Our Lord! You have made us to die twice (i.e. we were dead in the loins of our fathers and dead after our life in this world), and You have given us life twice (i.e. life when we were born and life when we are Resurrected)! Now we confess our sins, then is there any way to get out (of the Fire)?"" (Tafsir Al-Qurtubi,)",""
  40,12,"(It will be said): ""This is because, when Allâh Alone was invoked (in worship) you disbelieved (denied), but when partners were joined to Him, you believed! So the judgement is only with Allâh, the Most High, the Most Great!<sup>2</sup>""","[2] (V.40:12) Narrated ‘Abdullâh رضي الله عنه: ""The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said one statement and I said another. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""Whoever dies while still invoking anything other than Allâh as a rival to Allâh, will enter Hell (Fire)."" And I said, ‘Whoever dies without invoking anything as a rival to Allâh, will enter Paradise.’"" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 6, Hadith No. 24)."
  40,13,"It is He Who shows you His Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and sends down (rain with which grows) provision for you from the sky. And none remembers but those who turn (to Allâh in obedience and) in repentance (by begging His Pardon and by worshipping and obeying Him Alone and none else).",""
  40,14,"So, call you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and the believers) upon (or invoke) Allâh making (your) worship pure for Him (Alone) (by worshipping none but Him and by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allâh’s sake only and not to show off and not to set up rivals with Him in worship), however much the disbelievers (in the Oneness of Allâh) may hate (it).",""
  40,15,"(He is Allâh) Owner of High Ranks and Degrees, the Owner of the Throne. He sends the revelation by His Command to any of His slaves He wills, that he (the person who receives revelation) may warn (men) of the Day of Mutual Meeting (i.e. the Day of Resurrection).",""
  40,16,"The Day when they will (all) come out, nothing of them will be hidden from Allâh. Whose is the kingdom this Day? (Allâh Himself will reply to His Question): It is Allâh’s the One, the Irresistible!",""
