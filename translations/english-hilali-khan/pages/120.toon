  5,71,"They thought there will be no Fitnah (trial or punishment), so they became blind and deaf; after that Allâh turned to them (with Forgiveness); yet again many of them became blind and deaf. And Allâh is the All-Seer of what they do.",""
  5,72,"Surely, they have disbelieved who say: ""Allâh is the Messiah [‘Îsâ (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary)."" But the Messiah [‘Îsâ (Jesus)] said: ""O Children of Israel! Worship Allâh, my Lord and your Lord."" Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allâh, then Allâh has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode<sup>25</sup>. And for the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) there are no helpers.","[25] (V.5:72): See the footnote of the (V.2:165)."
  5,73,"Surely, disbelievers are those who said: ""Allâh is the third of the three (in a Trinity)."" But there is no Ilâh (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Ilâh (God -Allâh). And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them.",""
  5,74,"Will they not turn with repentance to Allâh and ask His Forgiveness? For Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.<sup>26</sup>","[26] (V.5:74) Narrated Anas bin Mâlik رضي الله عنه : Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said; ""Allâh is more pleased with the repentance of His slave than anyone of you is pleased with finding his camel which he had lost in a desert."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.8, Hadîth No.321)."
  5,75,"The Messiah [‘Îsâ (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary), was no more than a Messenger; many were the Messengers that passed away before him. His mother [Maryam (Mary)] was a Siddîqah [i.e. she believed in the Words of Allâh and His Books (see Verse 66:12)]. They both used to eat food (as any other human being, while Allâh does not eat). Look how We make the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) clear to them; yet look how they are deluded away (from the truth).",""
  5,76,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to mankind): ""How do you worship besides Allâh something which has no power either to harm or benefit you? But it is Allâh Who is the All-Hearer, All-Knower.""",""
