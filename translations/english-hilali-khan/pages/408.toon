quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  30,33,"And when harm touches men, they cry sincerely only to their Lord (Allâh), turning to Him in repentance; but when He gives them a taste of His Mercy, behold, a party of them associates partners in worship with their Lord.",""
  30,34,"So as to be ungrateful for the graces which We have bestowed on them. Then enjoy (your short life); but you will come to know.",""
  30,35,"Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him?",""
  30,36,"And when We cause mankind to taste of mercy, they rejoice therein; but when some evil afflicts them because of (evil deeds and sins) that their (own) hands have sent forth, behold, they are in despair!",""
  30,37,"Do they not see that Allâh enlarges the provision for whom He wills and straitens (it for whom He wills). Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who believe.",""
  30,38,"So give to the kindred his due, and to Al-Miskîn (the poor) and to the wayfarer. That is best for those who seek Allâh’s Countenance; and it is they who will be successful.",""
  30,39,"And that which you give in gift<sup>5</sup> (to others), in order that it may increase (your wealth by expecting to get a better one in return) from other people’s property, has no increase with Allâh; but that which you give in Zakât (sadaqa - charity etc.) seeking Allâh’s Countenance, then those, they shall have manifold increase.","[5] (V.30:39) See Tafsîr Ibn Kathir"
  30,40,"Allâh is He Who created you, then provided food for you, then will cause you to die, then (again) He will give you life (on the Day of Resurrection). Is there any of your (so-called) partners (of Allâh) that do anything of that? Glory be to Him! And Exalted be He above all that (evil) they associate (with Him).",""
  30,41,"Evil (sins and disobedience to Allâh) has appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of men have earned (by oppression and evil deeds), that He (Allâh) may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return (by repenting to Allâh, and begging His Pardon).",""
