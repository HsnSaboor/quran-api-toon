  7,179,"And surely, We have created many of the jinn and mankind for Hell. They have hearts wherewith they understand not, and they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not (the truth). They are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless ones.",""
  7,180,"And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allâh<sup>14</sup>, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who belie or deny (or utter impious speech against) His Names. They will be requited for what they used to do.","[14] (V.7:180) Allâh has one hundred minus one Names. (i.e. 99).\nNarrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : Allâh has ninety-nine Names, i.e. one-hundred minus one; and whoever believes in their meanings and acts accordingly, will enter Paradise; and Allâh is Witr (One) and loves the ‘witr’. (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 8, hadîth No.419)."
  7,181,"And of those whom We have created, there is a community who guides (others) with the truth, and establishes justice therewith.",""

  7,185,"Do they not look in the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all things that Allâh has created; and that it may be that the end of their lives is near. In what message after this will they then believe?",""
  7,186,"Whomsoever Allâh sends astray, none can guide him; and He lets them wander blindly in their transgressions.",""
  7,187,"They ask you about the Hour (Day of Resurrection): ""When will be its appointed time?"" Say: ""The knowledge thereof is with my Lord (Alone). None can reveal its time but He. Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you except all of a sudden."" They ask you as if you have a good knowledge of it. Say: ""The knowledge thereof is with Allâh (Alone), but most of mankind know not.""<sup>15</sup>","[15] (V.7:187): Narrated ‘Abdullâh رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""The keys of the unseen are five: Verily Allâh! With Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs. No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no person knows in what land he will die. Verily, Allâh is All-Knower, All-Aware."" (V.31:34). (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 6, hadîth No. 151)."
