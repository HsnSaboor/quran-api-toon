quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,84,"And (remember) when We took your covenant (saying): Shed not the blood of your (people), nor turn out your own people from their dwellings. Then, (this) you ratified and (to this) you bear witness.",""
  2,85,"After this, it is you who kill one another and drive out a party of you from their homes, assist (their enemies) against them, in sin and transgression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their expulsion was forbidden to you. Then do you believe in a part of the Scripture and reject the rest? Then what is the recompense of those who do so among you, except disgrace in the life of this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they shall be consigned to the most grievous torment. And Allâh is not unaware of what you do.",""
  2,86,"Those are they who have bought the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter. Their torment shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped.",""
  2,87,"And indeed, We gave Mûsâ (Moses) the Book and followed him up with a succession of Messengers. And We gave ‘Îsâ (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), clear signs and supported him with Rûh-ul-Qudus [Jibrael (Gabriel عليه السلام)]. Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with what you yourselves desired not, you grew arrogant? Some you disbelieved and some you killed.",""
  2,88,"And they say, ""Our hearts are wrapped (i.e. do not hear or understand Allâh’s Word)."" Nay, Allâh has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is that which they believe.",""
