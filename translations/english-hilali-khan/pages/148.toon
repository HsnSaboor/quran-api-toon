quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,147,"If they (Jews) belie you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) say: ""Your Lord is the Owner of Vast Mercy, and never will His Wrath be turned back from the people who are Mujrimûn (criminals, polytheists or sinners).""",""
  6,148,"Those who took partners (in worship) with Allâh will say: ""If Allâh had willed, we would not have taken partners (in worship) with Him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against His Will)."" Likewise belied those who were before them, (they argued falsely with Allâh’s Messengers), till they tasted Our Wrath. Say: ""Have you any knowledge (proof) that you can produce before us? Verily, you follow nothing but guess and you do nothing but lie.""",""
  6,149,"Say: ""With Allâh is the perfect proof and argument, (i.e. the Oneness of Allâh, the sending of His Messengers and His Holy Books to mankind); had He so willed, He would indeed have guided you all.""",""
  6,150,"Say: ""Bring forward your witnesses, who can testify that Allâh has forbidden this. Then if they testify, testify not you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) with them. And you should not follow the vain desires of such as treat Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) as falsehoods, and such as believe not in the Hereafter, and they hold others as equal (in worship) with their Lord.""",""
  6,151,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with Him; be good and dutiful to your parents; kill not your children because of poverty - We provide sustenance for you and for them; come not near to Al-Fawâhish (shameful sins, illegal sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly; and kill not anyone whom Allâh has forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islâmic law). This He has commanded you that you may understand.",""
