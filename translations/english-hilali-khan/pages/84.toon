quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,34,"Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allâh and to their husbands), and guard in the husband’s absence what Allâh orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity, their husband’s property). As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allâh is Ever Most High, Most Great.",""
  4,35,"If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from her’s; if they both wish for peace, Allâh will cause their reconciliation. Indeed Allâh is Ever All-Knower, Well-Acquainted with all things.",""
  4,36,"Worship Allâh and join none with Him (in worship); and do good to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, Al-Masâkîn (the poor), the neighbour who is near of kin, the neighbour who is a stranger, the companion by your side, the wayfarer (you meet), and those (slaves) whom your right hands possess. Verily, Allâh does not like such as are proud and boastful.",""
  4,37,"Those who are miserly and enjoin miserliness on other men and hide what Allâh has bestowed upon them of His Bounties. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a disgraceful torment.<sup>11</sup>","[11] (V.4:37) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Everyday two angels come down from heaven and one of them says, ‘O Allâh! Compensate every person who spends in Your Cause,’ and the other (angel) says, ‘O Allâh! Destroy every miser.’"" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.2, Hadîth No.522)."
