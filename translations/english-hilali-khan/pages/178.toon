  8,11,"(Remember) when He covered you with a slumber as a security from Him, and He caused water (rain) to descend on you from the sky, to clean you thereby and to remove from you the Rijz (whispering, evil-suggestions) of Shaitân(Satan), and to strengthen your hearts, and make your feet firm thereby.",""
  8,12,"(Remember) when your Lord revealed to the angels, ""Verily, I am with you, so keep firm those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who have disbelieved, so strike them over the necks, and smite over all their fingers and toes.""",""
