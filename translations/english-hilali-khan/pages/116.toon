  5,46,"And in their footsteps, We sent ‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary),<sup>15</sup> confirming the Taurât (Torah) that had come before him, and We gave him the Injeel (Gospel), in which was guidance and light and confirmation of the Taurât (Torah) that had come before it, a guidance and an admonition for Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2).","[15] (V.5:46) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, ""I am the nearest of all the people to the son of Maryam (Mary), and all the Prophets are paternal brothers, and there has been no Prophet between me and him [i.e., ‘Îsâ (Jesus)]."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No.651)"
  5,47,"Let the people of the Injeel (Gospel) judge by what Allâh has revealed therein. And whosoever does not judge by what Allâh has revealed (then) such (people) are the Fâsiqûn [the rebellious i.e. disobedient (of a lesser degree)] to Allâh.",""
  5,48,"And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) the Book (this Qur’ân) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Muhaymin (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures)<sup>16</sup>. So judge among them by what Allâh has revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging away from the truth that has come to you. To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way. If Allâh had willed, He would have made you one nation, but that (He) may test you in what He has given you; so compete in good deeds. The return of you (all) is to Allâh; then He will inform you about that in which you used to differ.","[16] (V.5:48) Muhaimin: that which testifies the truth that is therein and falsifies the falsehood that is added therein."
  5,49,"And so judge (you O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) among them by what Allâh has revealed and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they turn you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) far away from some of that which Allâh has sent down to you. And if they turn away, then know that Allâh’s Will is to punish them for some sins of theirs. And truly, most of men are Fâsiqûn (rebellious and disobedient to Allâh).",""
  5,50,"Do they then seek the judgement of (the days of) Ignorance?<sup>17</sup> And who is better in judgement than Allâh for a people who have firm Faith.","[17] (V.5:50): Narrated Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""The most hated persons to Allâh are three: (1) A person who deviates from the right conduct, i.e., an evil doer, in the Haram (sanctuaries of Makkah and Al-Madinah); (2) a person who wants that the traditions of the pre-Islâmic period of Ignorance should remain in Islâm; and (3) a person who seeks to shed somebody’s blood without any right"" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.9. Hadîth No. 21)."
