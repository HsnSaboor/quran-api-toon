quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  24,32,"And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Sâlihûn (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves). If they be poor, Allâh will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allâh is All-Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All-Knowing (about the state of the people).",""
  24,33,"And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allâh enriches them of His Bounty. And such of your slaves as seek a writing (of emancipation), give them such writing, if you find that there is good and honesty in them. And give them something (yourselves) out of the wealth of Allâh which He has bestowed upon you. And force not your maids to prostitution, if they desire chastity, in order that you may make a gain in the (perishable) goods of this worldly life. But if anyone compels them (to prostitution), then after such compulsion, Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful (to those women, i.e. He will forgive them because they have been forced to do this evil act unwillingly).",""
  24,34,"And indeed We have sent down for you Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) that make things plain, and the example of those who passed away before you, and an admonition for those who are Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2).",""
  24,35,"Allâh is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as (if there were) a niche and within it a lamp: the lamp is in a glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east (i.e. neither it gets sun-rays only in the morning) nor of the west (i.e. nor it gets sun-rays only in the afternoon, but it is exposed to the sun all day long), whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself), though no fire touched it. Light upon Light! Allâh guides to His Light whom He wills. And Allâh sets forth parables for mankind, and Allâh is All-Knower of everything.",""
  24,36,"In houses (mosques) which Allâh has ordered to be raised (to be cleaned, and to be honoured), in them His Name is remembered [i.e. Adhan, Iqamah, Salât (prayers), invocations, recitation of the Qur’ân etc.]. Therein glorify Him (Allah) in the mornings and in the afternoons or the evenings,<sup>4</sup>","[4] (V.24:36).\na) Narrated Abu Qatâdah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""If anyone of you enters a mosque, he should pray two Rak‘at (Tahiyyat-al-Masjid) before sitting."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.1, Hadith No.435).\nb) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""The reward of the Salât (prayer) offered by a person in congregation is multiplied twenty- five times as much than that of the Salât (prayer) offered in one’s house or in the market (alone). And this is because if he performs ablution and does it perfectly and then proceeds to the mosque, with the sole intention of praying: then for every step he takes towards the mosque, he is upgraded one degree in reward and one of his sins is taken off (crossed out) from his accounts (of deeds). When he offers his Salât (prayer), the angels keep on asking Allâh’s Blessings and Allâh’s Forgiveness for him as long as he is (staying) at his Musallâ (place of prayer). They say: ‘O Allâh! Bestow Your Blessings upon him, be merciful and kind to him.’ And one is regarded in Salât (prayer) as long as one is waiting for the Salât (prayer)."" (Sahih Al Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadith No.620)."
