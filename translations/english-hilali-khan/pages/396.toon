  28,85,"Verily, He Who has given you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) the Qur’an (i.e. ordered you to act on its laws and to preach it to others) will surely bring you back to Ma‘âd (place of return, either to Makkah or to Paradise after your death). Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""My Lord is Aware of him who brings guidance, and of him who is in manifest error.""",""
  28,86,"And you were not expecting that the Book (this Qur’ân) would be sent down to you, but it is a mercy from your Lord. So never be a supporter of the disbelievers.",""
  28,87,"And let them not turn you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) away from (preaching) the Ayât (revelations and verses) of Allâh after they have been sent down to you: and invite (men) to (believe in) your Lord<sup>7</sup> and be not of Al-Mushrikûn (those who associate partners with Allâh, e.g. polytheists, pagans, idolaters, and those who disbelieve in the Oneness of Allâh and deny the Prophethood of Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم).","[7] (V.28:87) i.e: in the Oneness (Tauhîd ) of Allâh - (1) Oneness of the Lordship of Allâh; (2) Oneness of the worship of Allâh; (3) Oneness of the Names and Qualities of Allâh."
  28,88,"And invoke not any other ilâh (god) along with Allâh: Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Everything will perish save His Face. His is the Decision, and to Him you (all) shall be returned.",""
  29,1,"Alif-Lâm-Mîm.",""
  29,2,"Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: ""We believe,"" and will not be tested.",""
  29,3,"And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allâh will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allâh knows all that before putting them to test).",""
  29,4,"Or think those who do evil deeds that they can outstrip Us (i.e. escape Our punishment)? Evil is that which they judge!",""
  29,5,"Whoever hopes for the Meeting<sup>1</sup> with Allâh, then Allâh’s Term is surely coming and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.","[1] (V.29:5) See (V.6:31) and its footnote."
  29,6,"And whosoever strives, he strives only for himself. Verily, Allâh stands not in need of any of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn, and all that exists).",""
