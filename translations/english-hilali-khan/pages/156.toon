quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,44,"And the dwellers of Paradise will call out to the dwellers of the Fire (saying): ""We have indeed found true what our Lord had promised us; have you also found true, what your Lord promised (warnings)?"" They shall say: ""Yes."" Then a crier will proclaim between them: ""The Curse of Allâh is on the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).""",""
  7,45,"Those who hindered (men) from the Path of Allâh, and would seek to make it crooked, and they were disbelievers in the Hereafter.",""
  7,46,"And between them will be a (barrier) screen and on Al-A‘râf <sup>4</sup> (a wall with elevated places) will be men (whose good and evil deeds would be equal in scale), who would recognise all (of the Paradise and Hell people), by their marks (the dwellers of Paradise by their white faces and the dwellers of Hell by their black faces), they will call out to the dwellers of Paradise, ""Salâmun ‘Alaikum"" (Peace be on you), and at that time they (men on Al-A‘râf) will not yet have entered it (Paradise), but they will hope to enter (it) with certainty.","[4] (V.7:46)\nAl-A‘râf It is said that it is a wall between Paradise and Hell and it has on it elevated places. [Please see Tafsir Al-Qurtubi]."
  7,47,"And when their eyes will be turned towards the dwellers of the Fire, they will say: ""Our Lord! Place us not with the people who are Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).""",""
  7,48,"And the men on Al-A‘râf (the wall) will call unto the men whom they would recognise by their marks, saying: ""Of what benefit to you were your great numbers (and hoards of wealth), and your arrogance (against Faith)?""",""
  7,49,"Are they those, of whom you swore that Allâh would never show them mercy. (Behold! It has been said to them): ""Enter Paradise, no fear shall be on you, nor shall you grieve.""",""
  7,50,"And the dwellers of the Fire will call to the dwellers of Paradise: ""Pour on us some water or anything that Allâh has provided you with."" They will say: ""Both (water and provision) Allâh has forbidden to the disbelievers.""",""
  7,51,"""Who took their religion as an amusement and play, and the life of the world deceived them."" So this Day We shall forget them as they forgot their meeting of this Day, and as they used to reject Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations).",""
