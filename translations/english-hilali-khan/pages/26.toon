quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,170,"When it is said to them: ""Follow what Allâh has sent down."" They say: ""Nay! We shall follow what we found our fathers following."" (Would they do that!) even though their fathers did not understand anything nor were they guided?",""
  2,171,"And the example of those who disbelieve is as that of him who shouts to those (flock of sheep) that hears nothing but calls and cries. (They are) deaf, dumb and blind. So they do not understand. (Tafsîr Al-Qurtubi )",""
  2,172,"O you who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism)! Eat of the lawful things that We have provided you<sup>34</sup> with, and be grateful to Allâh, if it is indeed He Whom you worship.","[34] (V.2:172) Narrated An-Nu‘mân bin Bashîr رضي الله عنه: I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, ""Both legal and illegal things are evident but in between them there are doubtful (unclear) things, and most of the people have no knowledge about them. So whoever saves himself from these unclear things, he saves his religion and his honour. And whoever indulges in these unclear things is like a shepherd who grazes (his animals) near the Himâ (private pasture) of someone else, and at any moment he is liable to get in it. (O people!) Beware! Every king has a Himâ and the Himâ of Allâh عز وجل on the earth is His illegal (forbidden) things. Beware! There is a piece of flesh in the body if it becomes good (reformed), the whole body becomes good, but if it gets spoilt, the whole body gets spoilt and that is the heart."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadîth No.49)."
  2,173,"He has forbidden you only the Maitah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allâh (or has been slaughtered for idols, on which Allâh’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering). But if one is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him. Truly, Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  2,174,"Verily, those who conceal what Allâh has sent down of the Book, and purchase a small gain therewith (of worldly things), they eat into their bellies nothing but fire. Allâh will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor purify them, and theirs will be a painful torment.",""
  2,175,"Those are they who have purchased error at the price of Guidance, and torment at the price of Forgiveness. So how bold they are (for evil deeds which will push them) to the Fire.",""
  2,176,"That is because Allâh has sent down the Book (the Qur’ân) in truth. And verily, those who disputed as regards the Book are far away in opposition.",""
