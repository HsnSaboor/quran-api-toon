  10,89,"Allâh said: ""Verily, the invocation of you both is accepted. So you both keep to the Straight Way (i.e. keep on doing good deeds and preaching Allâh’s Message with patience), and follow not the path of those who know not (the truth i.e. to believe in the Oneness of Allâh, and also to believe in the Reward of Allâh: Paradise).""",""
  10,90,"And We took the Children of Israel across the sea, and Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) with his hosts followed them in oppression and enmity, till when drowning overtook him, he said: ""I believe that none has the right to be worshipped but He (Allâh) in Whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am one of the Muslims (those who submit to Allâh’s Will).""",""
  10,91,"Now (you believe) while you refused to believe before and you were one of the Mufsidûn (evil-doers, the corrupters).",""
  10,92,"So this day We shall deliver your (dead) body (out from the sea) that you may be a sign to those who come after you! And verily, many among mankind are heedless of Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.).",""
  10,93,"And indeed We settled the Children of Israel in an honourable dwelling place (Shâm and Misr), and provided them with good things, and they differed not until the knowledge came to them. Verily, Allâh will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection in that in which they used to differ.",""
  10,94,"So if you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) are in doubt concerning that which We have revealed unto you, [i.e. that your name is written in the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], then ask those who are reading the Book [the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] before you. Verily, the truth has come to you from your Lord. So be not of those who doubt (it).<sup>13</sup>","[13] (V.10:94): See (V.2:76), (V.7:157) and their footnotes."
  10,95,"And be not one of those who belie the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh, for then you shall be one of the losers.",""
  10,96,"Truly! Those, against whom the Word (Wrath) of your Lord has been justified, will not believe.",""
  10,97,"Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the painful torment.",""
