  33,7,"And (remember) when We took from the Prophets their covenant, and from you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and from Nûh (Noah), Ibrâhîm (Abraham), Mûsâ (Moses), and ‘Îsâ (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary). We took from them a strong covenant.<sup>4</sup>","[4] (V.33:7) There are many Prophets and Messengers of Allâh. About twenty-five of them are mentioned in the Qur’an; out of these twenty-five, only five are of strong will: namely (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, Nûh (Noah), Ibrâhîm (Abraham), Mûsâ (Moses) and ‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) عليهم السلام)."
  33,8,"That He may ask the truthful (Allâh’s Messengers and His Prophets) about their truth (i.e. the conveyance of Allâh’s Message that which they were charged with). And He has prepared for the disbelievers a painful torment (Hell-fire).",""
  33,9,"O you who believe! Remember Allâh’s Favour to you, when there came against you hosts, and We sent against them a wind and forces that you saw not [i.e. troops of angels during the battle of Al-Ahzâb (the Confederates)]. And Allâh is Ever All-Seer of what you do.",""

  33,12,"And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease (of doubts) said: ""Allâh and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) promised us nothing but delusion!""",""
  33,13,"And when a party of them said: ""O people of Yathrib (Al-Madinah)! There is no stand (possible) for you (against the enemy attack!) Therefore go back!"" And a band of them ask for permission of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying: ""Truly, our homes lie open (to the enemy)."" And they lay not open. They but wished to flee.",""
  33,14,"And if the enemy had entered from all sides (of the city), and they had been exhorted to Al-Fitnah (i.e. to renegade from Islâm to polytheism), they would surely have committed it and would have hesitated thereupon but little.",""
