quran[11]{c,v,t,f}:
  28,60,"And whatever you have been given is an enjoyment of the life of (this) world and its adornment, and that (Hereafter) which is with Allâh is better and will remain forever. Have you then no sense?",""
  28,61,"Is he whom We have promised an excellent promise (Paradise) - which he will find true - like him whom We have made to enjoy the luxuries of the life of (this) world, then on the Day of Resurrection, he will be among those brought up (to be punished in the Hell-fire)?",""
  28,62,"And (remember) the Day when He will call to them and say: ""Where are My (so-called) partners whom you used to assert?""",""
  28,63,"Those about whom the Word will have come true (to be punished) will say: ""Our Lord! These are they whom we led astray. We led them astray, as we were astray ourselves. We declare our innocence (from them) before You. It was not us they worshipped.""",""
  28,64,"And it will be said (to them): ""Call upon your (so-called) partners (of Allâh)"", and they will call upon them, but they will give no answer to them, and they will see the torment. (They will then wish) if only they had been guided!",""
  28,65,"And (remember) the Day (Allâh) will call to them, and say: ""What answer gave you to the Messengers?""",""
  28,66,"Then the news of a good answer will be obscured to them on that day, and they will not be able to ask one another.",""
  28,67,"But as for him who repented (from polytheism and sins), believed (in the Oneness of Allâh, and in His Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and did righteous deeds (in the life of this world), then he will be among those who are successful.",""
  28,68,"And your Lord creates whatsoever He wills and chooses: no choice have they (in any matter). Glorified be Allâh, and exalted above all that they associate (as partners with Him).",""
  28,69,"And your Lord knows what their breasts conceal, and what they reveal.",""
  28,70,"And He is Allâh: Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), all praises and thanks be to Him (both) in the first (i.e. in this world) and in the last (i.e. in the Hereafter). And for Him is the Decision, and to Him shall you (all) be returned.",""
