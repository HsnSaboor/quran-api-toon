  30,42,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""Travel in the land and see what was the end of those before (you)! Most of them were Mushrikûn (polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah).""",""
  30,43,"So set you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) your face (in obedience to Allâh, your Lord) to the straight and right religion (Islâmic Monotheism), before there comes from Allâh a Day which none can avert. On that Day men shall be divided [(in two groups), a group in Paradise and a group in Hell].",""
  30,44,"Whosoever disbelieves will suffer from his disbelief, and whosoever does righteous good deeds (by practising Islâmic Monotheism), then such will prepare a good place (in Paradise) for themselves (and will be saved by Allâh from His Torment).",""
  30,45,"That He may reward those who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism), and do righteous good deeds, out of His Bounty. Verily, He likes not the disbelievers.",""
  30,46,"And among His Signs is this, that He sends the winds as glad tidings, giving you a taste of His Mercy (i.e. rain), and that the ships may sail at His Command, and that you may seek of His Bounty, in order that you may be thankful.",""
  30,47,"And indeed We did send Messengers before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) to their own peoples. They came to them with clear proofs, then, We took vengeance on those who committed crimes (disbelief, setting partners in worship with Allâh, sins); and (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon Us to help (them).",""
  30,48,"Allâh is He Who sends the winds, so that they raise clouds, and spread them along the sky as He wills, and then break them into fragments, until you see rain drops come forth from their midst! Then when He has made them fall on whom of His slaves as He wills, lo, they rejoice!",""
  30,49,"And verily before that (rain) - just before it was sent down upon them - they were in despair!",""
  30,50,"Look then at the effects (results) of Allâh’s Mercy: how He revives the earth after its death. Verily, that (Allâh) (Who revived the earth after its death) shall indeed raise the dead (on the Day of Resurrection), and He is Able to do all things.",""
