quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  34,23,"Intercession with Him profits not except for him whom He permits. So much so that when fear is banished from their (angels’) hearts, they (angels) say: ""What is it that your Lord has said?"" They say: ""The truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.""",""
  34,24,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to polytheists, pagans) ""Who gives you provision from the heavens and the earth?"" Say: ""Allâh. And verily, (either) we or you are rightly guided or in plain error.""",""
  34,25,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to polytheists, pagans) ""You will not be asked about our sins, nor shall we be asked of what you do.""",""
  34,26,"Say: ""Our Lord will assemble us all together (on the Day of Resurrection), then He will judge between us with truth. And He is the Just Judge, the All-Knower of the true state of affairs [Tafsir Ibn Kathir]",""
  34,27,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to polytheists and pagans): ""Show me those whom you have joined with Him as partners. Nay (there are not at all any partners with Him)! But He is Allâh (Alone), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.""",""
  34,28,"And We have not sent you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind, but most of men know not.<sup>2</sup>","[2] (V.34:28) See the footnote of (V.2:252)."
  34,29,"And they say: ""When is this promise (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) if you are truthful?""",""
  34,30,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""The appointment to you is for a Day, which you cannot put back for an hour (or a moment) nor put forward.""",""
  34,31,"And those who disbelieve say: ""We believe not in this Qur’ân nor in that which was before it."" But if you could see when the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) will be made to stand before their Lord, how they will cast the (blaming) word one to another! Those who were deemed weak will say to those who were arrogant: ""Had it not been for you, we should certainly have been believers!""",""
