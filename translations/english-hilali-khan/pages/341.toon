quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  22,73,"O mankind! A similitude has been coined, so listen to it (carefully): Verily those on whom you call besides Allâh, cannot create (even) a fly, even though they combine together for the purpose. And if the fly snatches away a thing from them, they will have no power to release it from the fly. So weak are (both) the seeker and the sought.",""
  22,74,"They have not estimated Allâh His Rightful Estimate. Verily, Allâh is All-Strong, All-Mighty.",""
  22,75,"Allâh chooses Messengers from angels and from men. Verily, Allâh is All-Hearer, All-Seer.",""
  22,76,"He knows what is before them, and what is behind them. And to Allâh return all matters (for decision).",""
  22,77,"O you who have believed! Bow down, and prostrate yourselves, and worship your Lord and do good that you may be successful.",""
  22,78,"And strive hard in Allâh’s Cause as you ought to strive (with sincerity and with all your efforts that His Name should be superior). He has chosen you (to convey His Message of Islâmic Monotheism to mankind by inviting them to His religion of Islâm), and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship:<sup>9</sup> it is the religion of your father Ibrâhîm (Abraham) (Islâmic Monotheism). It is He (Allâh) Who has named you Muslims both before and in this (the Qur’ân), that the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) may be a witness over you and you be witnesses over mankind!<sup>10</sup> So perform As-Salât (Iqamat-as-Salât), give Zakât and hold fast to Allâh [i.e. have confidence in Allâh, and depend upon Him in all your affairs]. He is your Maulâ (Patron, Lord), what an Excellent Maulâ (Patron, Lord) and what an Excellent Helper!","[9] (V.22:78) Religion is very easy. And the statement of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: ""The most beloved religion to Allâh عز وجل is the tolerant Hanifiyyah [i.e., Islâmic Monotheism, i.e., to worship Him (Allâh) Alone and not to worship anything else along with Him.]""\nNarrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Religion is very easy and whoever overburdens himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So you should not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and receive the good tidings that you will be rewarded; and gain strength by offering the Salât (prayers) in the mornings, afternoons and during the last hours of the nights."" (See Fath Al-Bari, Vol.1, Page 102). (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.1, Hadith No.38).\n[10] (V.22:78) See the footnote of (V.2:143)."
