  10,62,"No doubt! Verily, the Auliyâ’ of Allâh [i.e. those who believe in the Oneness of Allâh and fear Allâh much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he has forbidden), and love Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)], no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve.<sup>10</sup>","[10] (V.10:62) Narrated Abu Sa‘îd Al-Khudrî رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""When the funeral is ready and the men carry it on their shoulders, if the deceased was righteous, it will say: ‘Present me (hurriedly),’ and if he was not righteous, it will say: ‘Woe to it (me)! Where are they taking it (me)?’ Its voice is heard by everything except man, and if he heard it, he would fall unconscious."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.2,Hadith No.400)."
  10,63,"Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism), and used to fear Allâh much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing righteous deeds).",""
  10,64,"For them are glad tidings, in the life of the present world<sup>11</sup> (i.e. through a righteous dream seen by the person himself or shown to others), and in the Hereafter. No change can there be in the Words of Allâh. This is indeed the supreme success.","[11] (V.10:64)\na) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying: ""Nothing is left of النبوة An-Nubuwwah (Prophethood) except Al-Mubashshirât."" They asked, ""What is Al-Mubashshirât?"" He replied, ""The true good dreams (that convey glad tidings)."". (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.9,Hadith No.119). b) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""The (good) dream of a faithful believer is a part of the forty-six parts of An-Nubuwwah (Prophethood)."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.9,Hadith No. 117)."
  10,65,"And let not their speech grieve you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), for all power and honour belong to Allâh. He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.",""
  10,66,"No doubt! Verily, to Allâh belongs whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth. And those who worship and invoke others besides Allâh, in fact they follow not (Allâh’s so-called) partners, they follow only a conjecture and they only invent lies.",""
  10,67,"He it is Who has appointed for you the night that you may rest therein, and the day to make things visible (to you). Verily, in this are Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) for a people who listen (i.e. those who think deeply).",""
  10,68,"They (Jews, Christians and pagans) say: ""Allâh has begotten a son (children)."" Glory is to Him! He is Rich (Free of all needs). His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. No warrant you have for this. Do you say against Allâh what you know not.<sup>12</sup>","[12] (V.10:68) See the footnote of (V.6:101)"
  10,69,"Say: ""Verily, those who invent a lie against Allâh will never be successful"" -",""
  10,70,"(A brief) enjoyment in this world! - and then unto Us will be their return, then We shall make them taste the severest torment because they used to disbelieve [in Allâh, belie His Messengers, deny and challenge His Ayât (proofs, signs, verses, etc.)].",""
