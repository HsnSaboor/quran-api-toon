quran[10]{c,v,t,f}:
  30,51,"And if We send a wind [which would spoil the green growth (tilth) brought up by the previous rain], and they see (their tilth) turn yellow - behold, they then (after their being glad,) would become unthankful (to their Lord Allâh as) disbelievers. [Tafsir At-Tabari]",""
  30,52,"So verily, you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) cannot make the dead to hear (i.e. the disbelievers), nor can you make the deaf to hear the call, when they show their backs and turn away.",""
  30,53,"And you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) cannot guide the blind from their straying; you can make to hear only those who believe in Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), and have submitted to Allâh in Islâm (as Muslims).",""
  30,54,"Allâh is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness and grey hair. He creates what He wills. And it is He Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful (i.e. Able to do all things).",""
  30,55,"And on the Day that the Hour will be established, the Mujrimûn (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) will swear that they stayed not but an hour - thus were they ever deluded [away from the truth (i.e. they used to tell lies and take false oaths, and turn away from the truth) in this life of the world)]",""
  30,56,"And those who have been bestowed with knowledge and faith will say: ""Indeed you have stayed according to the Decree of Allâh, until the Day of Resurrection: so this is the Day of Resurrection, but you knew not.""",""
  30,57,"So on that Day no excuse of theirs will avail those who did wrong (by associating partners in worship with Allâh, and by denying the Day of Resurrection), nor will they be allowed (then) to return to seek Allâh’s Pleasure (by having Islâmic Faith with righteous deeds and by giving up polytheism, sins and crimes with repentance).",""
  30,58,"And indeed We have set forth for mankind, in this Qur’ân every kind of parable. But if you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) bring to them any sign or proof (as an evidence for the truth of your Prophethood), the disbelievers are sure to say (to the believers): ""You follow nothing but falsehood, and magic.""",""
  30,59,"Thus does Allâh seal up the hearts of those who know not [the proofs and evidence of the Oneness of Allâh i.e. those who try not to understand true facts that which you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) have brought to them].",""
  30,60,"So be patient (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم). Verily, the Promise of Allâh is true; and let not those who have no certainty of faith, discourage you from conveying Allâh’s Message (which you are obliged to convey).",""
