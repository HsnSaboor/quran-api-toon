  4,163,"Verily, We have sent the revelation to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)<sup>44</sup> as We sent the revelation to Nûh (Noah) and the Prophets after him; We (also) sent the revelation to Ibrâhîm (Abraham), Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael), Ishâq (Isaac), Ya‘qûb (Jacob), and Al-Asbât [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya‘qûb (Jacob)], ‘Îsâ (Jesus), Ayyûb (Job), Yûnus (Jonah), Hârûn (Aaron), and Sulaimân (Solomon); and to Dâwûd (David) We gave the Zabûr (Psalms).","[44] (V.4:163) - Ash-Shaikh Al-Imâm Al-Hâfiz Abu ‘Abdullâh Muhammad bin Isma‘îl bin Ibrahîm bin Al-Mughîrah Al-Bukhâri (may Allâh عز وجل be Merciful to him) said: How the Divine Inspiration started to be revealed to Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم. And the Statement of Allâh تعالى: ""Indeed, We have sent the revelation to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as We sent the revelation to Nûh (Noah) and the Prophets after him."" (V.4:163). Narrated ‘Umar bin Al-Khttâb رضي الله عنه: I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, ""The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended.

Narrated ‘Aishah, the mother of the faithful believers رضي الله عنها: Al-Hârith bin Hishâm رضي الله عنه asked Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم: ""O Allâh’s Messenger! How is the Divine Inspiration revealed to you?"" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم replied, ""Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell, this form of the revelation is the hardest of all and then this state passes off after I have grasped what is inspired. Sometimes the angel comes in the from of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says."" ‘Aishah رضي الله عنها added: ""Verily, I saw the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم being inspired divinely and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead on a very cold day as the revelation was over.""
