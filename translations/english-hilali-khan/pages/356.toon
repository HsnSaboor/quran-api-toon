quran[10]{c,v,t,f}:
  24,44,"Allâh causes the night and the day to succeed each other (i.e. if the day is gone, the night comes, and if the night is gone, the day comes, and so on). Truly, in this is indeed a lesson for those who have insight.",""
  24,45,"Allâh has created every moving (living) creature from water. Of them there are some that creep on their bellies, and some that walk on two legs, and some that walk on four. Allâh creates what He wills. Verily Allâh is Able to do all things.",""
  24,46,"We have indeed sent down (in this Qur’ân) manifest Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, lawful and unlawful things, and the set boundaries of Islâmic religion, etc. that make things clear showing the Right Path of Allâh). And Allâh guides whom He wills to the Straight Path (i.e. to Allâh’s religion of Islâmic Monotheism).",""
  24,47,"They (hypocrites) say: ""We have believed in Allâh and in the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and we obey,"" then a party of them turn away thereafter, such are not believers.",""
  24,48,"And when they are called to Allâh (i.e. His Words, the Qur’ân) and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), to judge between them, lo! a party of them refuses (to come) and turns away.",""
  24,49,"But if the truth is on their side, they come to him willingly with submission.",""
  24,50,"Is there a disease in their hearts? Or do they doubt or fear lest Allâh and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) should wrong them in judgement. Nay, it is they themselves who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists, hypocrites and wrong-doers).",""
  24,51,"The only saying of the faithful believers, when they are called to Allâh (His Words, the Qur’ân) and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), to judge between them, is that they say: ""We hear and we obey."" And such are the successful (who will live forever in Paradise).",""
  24,52,"And whosoever obeys Allâh and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), fears Allâh, and keeps his duty (to Him), such are the successful.",""
  24,53,"They swear by Allâh their strongest oaths, that if only you would order them, they would leave (their homes for fighting in Allâh’s Cause). Say: ""Swear you not; (this) obedience (of yours) is known (to be false). Verily, Allâh knows well what you do.""",""
