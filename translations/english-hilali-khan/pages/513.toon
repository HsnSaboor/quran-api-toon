quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  48,16,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) to the bedouins who lagged behind: ""You shall be called to fight against a people given to great warfare, then you shall fight them, or they shall surrender. Then if you obey, Allâh will give you a fair reward; but if you turn away as you did turn away before, He will punish you with a painful torment.""",""
  48,17,"No blame or sin is there upon the blind, nor is there blame or sin upon the lame, nor is there blame or sin upon the sick (that they go not for fighting). And whosoever obeys Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), He will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow (Paradise); and whosoever turns back, He will punish him with a painful torment.",""
  48,18,"Indeed, Allâh was pleased with the believers when they gave the Bai‘ah (pledge) to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) under the tree: He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down As-Sakînah (calmness and tranquillity) upon them, and He rewarded them with a near victory.",""
  48,19,"And abundant spoils that they will capture. And Allâh is Ever All-Mighty, All-Wise.",""
  48,20,"Allâh has promised you abundant spoils that you will capture, and He has hastened for you this, and He has restrained the hands of men from you: that it may be a sign for the believers, and that He may guide you to the Straight Path.",""
  48,21,"And other (victories and much booty He promises you) which are not yet within your power; indeed Allâh compasses them. And Allâh is Ever Able to do all things.",""
  48,22,"And if those who disbelieve fight against you, they certainly would have turned their backs; then they would have found neither a Walî (protector, guardian) nor a helper.",""
  48,23,"That has been the Way of Allâh already with those who passed away before. And you will not find any change in the Way of Allâh.",""
