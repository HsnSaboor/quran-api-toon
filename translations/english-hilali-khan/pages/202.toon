quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,94,"They (the hypocrites) will present their excuses to you (Muslims), when you return to them. Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) ""Present no excuses, we shall not believe you. Allâh has already informed us of the news concerning you. Allâh and His Messenger will observe your deeds. In the end you will be brought back to the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen, then He (Allâh) will inform you of what you used to do."" [Tafsir At-Tabari]",""
  9,95,"They will swear by Allâh to you (Muslims) when you return to them, that you may turn away from them. So turn away from them. Surely, they are Rijs [i.e. Najas (impure) because of their evil deeds], and Hell is their dwelling place - a recompense for that which they used to earn.",""
  9,96,"They (the hypocrites) swear to you (Muslims) that you may be pleased with them, but if you are pleased with them, certainly Allâh is not pleased with the people who are Al-Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh).",""
  9,97,"The bedouins are the worst in disbelief and hypocrisy, and more likely to be in ignorance of the limits (Allâh’s Commandments and His Laws) which Allâh has revealed to His Messenger. And Allâh is All-Knower, All-Wise.",""
  9,98,"And of the bedouins there are some who look upon what they spend (in Allâh’s Cause) as a fine and watch for calamities for you, on them be the calamity of evil. And Allâh is All-Hearer, All-Knower.",""
  9,99,"And of the bedouins there are some who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, and look upon what they spend in Allâh’s Cause as means of nearness to Allâh, and a cause of receiving the Messenger’s invocations. Indeed these (spendings in Allâh’s Cause) are a means of nearness for them. Allâh will admit them to His Mercy. Certainly Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
