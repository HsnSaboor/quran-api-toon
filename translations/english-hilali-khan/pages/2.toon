  2,2,"This is the Book (the Qur’ân), whereof there is no doubt, a guidance to those who are Al-Muttaqûn [the pious believers of Islamic Monotheism who fear Allâh much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He has forbidden) and love Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)].",""
  2,3,"Who believe in the Ghaib <sup>1</sup> and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât),<sup>2</sup> and spend out of what We have provided for them [i.e. give Zakât <sup>3</sup>, spend on themselves, their parents, their children, their wives, etc., and also give charity to the poor and also in Allâh’s Cause - Jihâd].","[1] (V.2:3): Al-Ghaib: literally means a thing not seen. But this word includes vast meanings: Belief in Allâh, Angels, Holy Books, Allâh’s Messengers, Day of Resurrection and Al-Qadar (Divine Pre-ordainments). It also includes what Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم informed about the knowledge of the matters of past, present, and future e.g., news about the creation of the heavens and earth, botanical and zoological life, the news about the nations of the past, and about Paradise and Hell.\n[2] (V.2:3): Iqâmat-as-Salât إقامة الصلاة: The performance of Salât (prayers). It means that:\n[3] (V.2:3) Zakât زكاة : A certain fixed proportion of the wealth and of each and every kind of property liable to Zakât of a Muslim to be paid yearly for the benefit of the poor in the Muslim community. The payment of Zakât is obligatory as it is one of the five pillars of Islâm. Zakât is the major economic means for establishing social justice and leading the Muslim society to prosperity and security. [See Sahih Al- Bukhâri, Vol. 2, Book of Zakât, No. 24]"

(Resurrection, recompense of their good and bad deeds, Paradise and Hell).","[4] (V.2:4) Narrated Ibn ‘Umar رضي الله عنهما: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: Islâm is based on (the following) five (principles):\n1. To testify that "" Lâ ilâha illallâh wa anna Muhammad-ur-Rasûl Allâh "" (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh and that Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is the Messenger of Allâh). \n2. Iqâmat-as-Salât: to perform the five (compulsory congregational) Salât (prayers). \n3. To pay Zakât \n4. To perform Hajj (i.e. pilgrimage to Makkah). \n5. To observe Saum (fasting) during the month of Ramadan. (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 1, Hadith No. 7)."
