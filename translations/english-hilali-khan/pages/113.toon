quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,32,"Because of that We ordained for the Children of Israel that if anyone killed a person not in retaliation of murder, or (and) to spread mischief in the land - it would be as if he killed all mankind, and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind. And indeed, there came to them Our Messengers with clear proofs, evidence, and signs, even then after that many of them continued to exceed the limits (e.g. by doing oppression unjustly and exceeding beyond the limits set by Allâh by committing the major sins) in the land!<sup>10</sup>","[10] (V.5:32) Narrated Anas bin Mâlik رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""The biggest of Al-Kabâ’ir (the great sins) are: (1) To join others as partners in worship with Allâh, (2) to murder a human being, (3) to be undutiful to one’s parents (4) and to make a false statement,"" or said, ""to give a false witness."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.9, Hadîth No.10)."
  5,33,"The recompense of those who wage war against Allâh and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off from opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter.",""
  5,34,"Except for those who (having fled away and then) came back (as Muslims) with repentance before they fall into your power; in that case, know that Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  5,35,"O you who believe! Do your duty to Allâh and fear Him. And seek the means of approach to Him, and strive hard in His Cause (as much as you can), so that you may be successful.<sup>11</sup>","[11] (V.5:35) See the footnote of (V.2:186)."
  5,36,"Verily, those who disbelieve, if they had all that is in the earth, and as much again therewith to ransom themselves thereby from the torment on the Day of Resurrection, it would never be accepted of them, and theirs would be a painful torment.<sup>12</sup>","[12] (V.5:36) See the footnote of (V.3:91)."
