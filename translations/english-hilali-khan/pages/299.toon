quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  18,46,"Wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world. But the good righteous deeds,<sup>3</sup> that last, are better with your Lord for rewards and better in respect of hope.","[3] (V.18:46): good righteous deeds:- five compulsory prayers, deeds of Allâh’s obedience, good and nice talk, remembrance of Allâh with glorification, praises and thanks."
  18,47,"And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a levelled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.",""
  18,48,"And they will be set before your Lord in (lines as) rows, (and Allâh will say): ""Now indeed, you have come to Us as We created you the first time. Nay, but you thought that We had appointed no meeting for you (with Us).""",""
  18,49,"And the Book (one’s Record) will be placed (in the right hand for a believer in the Oneness of Allâh, and in the left hand for a disbeliever in the Oneness of Allâh), and you will see the Mujrimûn (criminals, polytheists, sinners), fearful of that which is (recorded) therein. They will say: ""Woe to us! What sort of Book is this that leaves neither a small thing nor a big thing, but has recorded it with numbers!"" And they will find all that they did, placed before them, and your Lord treats no one with injustice.",""
  18,50,"And (remember) when We said to the angels: ""Prostrate yourselves unto Adam."" So they prostrated themselves except Iblîs (Satan). He was one of the jinn; he disobeyed the Command of his Lord. Will you then take him (Iblîs) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you? What an evil is the exchange for the Zâlimûn (polytheists, and wrong-doers).",""
  18,51,"I (Allâh) made them (Iblîs and his offspring) not to witness (nor took their help in) the creation of the heavens and the earth and not (even) their own creation, nor was I (Allâh) to take the misleaders as helpers.",""
  18,52,"And (remember) the Day He will say: ""Call those (so-called) partners of Mine whom you pretended."" Then they will cry unto them, but they will not answer them, and We shall put a Maubiq (barrier)<sup>4</sup> between them.","[4] (V.18:52): In Arabic ""Maubiq"" also means enmity, or destruction, or a valley in Hell."
  18,53,"And the Mujrimûn (criminals, polytheists, sinners) shall see the Fire and apprehend that they have to fall therein. And they will find no way of escape from there.",""
