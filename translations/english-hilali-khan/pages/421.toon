quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  33,23,"Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allâh [i.e. they have gone out for Jihâd (holy fighting), and showed not their backs to the disbelievers]; of them some have fulfilled their obligations (i.e. have been martyred); and some of them are still waiting, but they have never changed [i.e. they never proved treacherous to their covenant which they concluded with Allâh] in the least.<sup>5</sup>","[5] (V.33:23) Narrated Anas رضي الله عنه: My uncle Anas bin An-Nadr was absent from the battle of Badr. He said, ""O Allâh’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم)! I was absent from the first battle you fought against the pagans. (By Allah) if Allah gives me a chance to fight the pagans, no doubt, Allah will see how (bravely) I will fight."" On the day of Uhud when the Muslims turned their backs and fled, he said, ""O Allah! I apologise to You for what these (i.e. his companions) have done, and I denounce what these (i.e. the pagans) have done."" Then he advanced and Sa‘d bin Mu‘âdh met him. He said, ""O Sa‘d bin Mu‘âdh! By the Lord of An-Nadr, Paradise! I am smelling its aroma coming from before (the mountain of) Uhud,"" Later on, Sa‘d said, ""O Allah’s Messenger! I cannot achieve or do what he (i.e. Anas bin An-Nadr) did. We found more than eighty wounds by swords and arrows on his body. We found him dead and his body mutilated so badly that none except his sister could recognise him by his fingers."" We used to think that the following Verse was revealed concerning him and other men of his sort: ""Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah.""(V.33:23).\nHis sister Ar-Rubaiyi‘ broke a front tooth of a woman and Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم ordered for retaliation. On that Anas bin An-Nadr, said, ""O Allâh’s Messenger! By Him Who has sent you with the truth, my sister’s tooth shall not be broken, then the opponents of Anas’s sister accepted the compensation and gave up the claim of retaliation. So Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""There are some people amongst Allâh’s slaves whose oaths are fulfilled by Allah when they take them."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.4, Hadîth No.61)."
  33,24,"That Allâh may reward the men of truth for their truth (i.e. for their patience at the accomplishment of that which they covenanted with Allâh), and punish the hypocrites, if He wills, or accept their repentance by turning to them (in Mercy). Verily, Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  33,25,"And Allâh drove back those who disbelieved in their rage: they gained no advantage (booty). Allâh sufficed for the believers in the fighting (by sending against the disbelievers a severe wind and troops of angels). And Allâh is Ever All-Strong, All-Mighty.",""
  33,26,"And those of the people of the Scripture who backed them (the disbelievers), Allâh brought them down from their forts and cast terror into their hearts, (so that) a group (of them) you killed, and a group (of them) you made captives.",""
  33,27,"And He caused you to inherit their lands, and their houses, and their riches, and a land which you had not trodden (before). And Allâh is Able to do all things.",""
  33,28,"O Prophet (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)! Say to your wives: ""If you desire the life of this world, and its glitter, then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free in a handsome manner (divorce).<sup>6</sup>","[6] (V.33:28)\na) Narrated ‘Âishah رضي الله عنها, the wife of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: When Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم was ordered to give option to his wives, he started with me, saying, ""I am going to mention to you something, but you shall not hasten (to give your reply) unless you consult your parents."" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم knew that my parents would not order me to leave him. Then he said, ""Allâh says: ""O Prophet (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)! Say to your wives: ‘If you desire the life of this world and its glitter... an enormous reward.’ "" (V.33:29).\nI said, ""Then why consult I my parents? Verily, I desire Allah, His Messenger and the Home of the Hereafter."" Then all the other wives of the Prophet did the same as I did.\n(Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadith No.309).\nb) Narrated ‘Âishah رضي الله عنها: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم gave us the option (to remain with him or to be divorced) and we chose Allâh and His Messenger. So that option was not regarded as divorce. (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.7, Hadîth No.188)."
  33,29,"""But if you desire Allâh and His Messenger, and the home of the Hereafter, then verily, Allâh has prepared for Al-Muhsinât (good-doers) amongst you an enormous reward.""",""
  33,30,"O wives of the Prophet! Whoever of you commits an open illegal sexual intercourse, the torment for her will be doubled, and that is ever easy for Allâh.",""
