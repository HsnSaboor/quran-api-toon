quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,28,"Nay, it has become manifest to them what they had been concealing before. But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars.",""
  6,29,"And they said: ""There is no (other life) but our (present) life of this world, and never shall we be resurrected (on the Day of Resurrection).""",""
  6,30,"If you could but see when they will be held (brought and made to stand) in front of their Lord! He will say: ""Is not this (Resurrection and the taking of the accounts) the truth?"" They will say: ""Yes, by our Lord!"" He will then say: ""So taste you the torment because you used not to believe.""",""
  6,31,"They indeed are losers who denied their Meeting with Allâh,<sup>4</sup> until all of a sudden, the Hour (signs of death) is on them, and they say: ""Alas for us that we gave no thought to it,"" while they will bear their burdens on their backs; and evil indeed are the burdens that they will bear!","[4] (V.6:31) Narrated Abu Mûsâ رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Whoever loves the Meeting with Allâh, Allâh too loves the Meeting with him; and whoever hates the Meeting with Allâh, Allâh too hates the Meeting with him."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.8, Hadîth No.515)."
  6,32,"And the life of this world is nothing but play and amusement. But far better is the house in the Hereafter for those who are Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2). Will you not then understand?",""
  6,33,"We know indeed the grief which their words cause you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): it is not you that they deny, but it is the Verses (the Qur’ân) of Allâh that the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) deny.",""
  6,34,"Verily, (many) Messengers were denied before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), but with patience they bore the denial, and they were hurt; till Our Help reached them, and none can alter the Words (Decisions) of Allâh. Surely there has reached you the information (news) about the Messengers (before you).",""
  6,35,"If their aversion (from you, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and from that with which you have been sent) is hard on you, (and you cannot be patient of their harm to you), then if you were able to seek a tunnel in the earth or a ladder to the sky, so that you may bring them a sign (and you cannot do it, so be patient). And had Allâh willed, He could have gathered them together (all) on true guidance, so be not you one of those who are Al-Jâhilûn (the ignorant).",""
