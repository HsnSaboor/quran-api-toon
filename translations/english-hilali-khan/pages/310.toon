  19,65,"Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, so worship Him (Alone) and be constant and patient in His worship. Do you know of any who is similar to Him? (of course none is similar or co-equal or comparable to Him, and He has none as partner with Him). [There is nothing like Him and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer].<sup>12</sup>","[12] (V.19:65) See the footnote of (V.3:73)."
  19,66,"And man (the disbeliever) says: ""When I am dead, shall I then be raised up alive?""",""
  19,67,"Does not man remember that We created him before, while he was nothing?",""
  19,68,"So by your Lord, surely, We shall gather them together, and (also) the Shayâtîn (devils) (with them), then We shall bring them round Hell on their knees.",""
  19,69,"Then indeed We shall drag out from every sect all those who were worst in obstinate rebellion against the Most Gracious (Allâh).",""
  19,70,"Then, verily, We know best those who are most worthy of being burnt therein.",""
  19,71,"There is not one of you but will pass over it (Hell): this is with your Lord; a Decree which must be accomplished.<sup>13</sup>","[13] (V.19:71) See the footnote (C) of (V.68:42)."
  19,72,"Then We shall save those who used to fear Allâh and were dutiful to Him. And We shall leave the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrongdoers) therein (humbled) to their knees (in Hell).",""
  19,73,"And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, those who disbelieve (the rich and strong among the pagans of Quraish who live a life of luxury) say to those who believe (the weak, poor companions of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم who have a hard life): ""Which of the two groups (i.e. believers or disbelievers) is best in (point of) position and as regards station (place of council for consultation).""",""
  19,74,"And how many a generation (past nations) have We destroyed before them, who were better in wealth, goods and outward appearance?",""
  19,75,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) whoever is in error, the Most Gracious (Allâh) will extend (the rope) to him, until, when they see that which they were promised, either the torment or the Hour, they will come to know who is worst in position, and who is weaker in forces. [This is the answer to the question in Verse No.19:73]",""
  19,76,"And Allâh increases in guidance those who walk aright.<sup>14</sup> And the righteous good deeds that last, are better with your Lord, for reward and better for resort.","[14] (V.19:76) those who walk aright i.e. the true believers in the Oneness of Allâh - who fear Allâh much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He has forbidden), and love Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)."
