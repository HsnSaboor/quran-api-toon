quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  28,44,"And you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) were not on the western side (of the Mount), when We made clear to Mûsâ (Moses) the commandment, and you were not among the witnesses.",""
  28,45,"But We created generations [after generations i.e. after Mûsâ (Moses) عليه السلام], and long were the ages that passed over them. And you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) were not a dweller among the people of Madyan (Midian), reciting Our Verses to them. But it is We Who kept sending (Messengers).",""
  28,46,"And you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) were not at the side of the Tûr (Mount) when We did call: [it is said that Allâh called the followers of Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, and they answered His Call, or that Allâh called Mûsâ (Moses)]. But (you are sent) as a mercy from your Lord, to give warning to a people to whom no warner had come before you: in order that they may remember or receive admonition. [Tafsir At-Tabarî].",""
  28,47,"And if (We had) not (sent you to the people of Makkah) - in case a calamity should seize them for (the deeds) that their hands have sent forth, they would have said: ""Our Lord! Why did You not send us a Messenger? We would then have followed Your Ayât (Verses of the Qur’ân) and would have been among the believers.""",""
  28,48,"But when the truth (i.e. Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم with his Message) has come to them from Us, they say: ""Why is he not given the like of what was given to Mûsâ (Moses)? Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Mûsâ (Moses) of old? They say: ""Two kinds of magic [the Taurât (Torah) and the Qur’an], each helping the other!"" And they say: ""Verily in both we are disbelievers.""",""
  28,49,"Say (to them, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""Then bring a Book from Allâh, which is a better guide than these two [the Taurât (Torah) and the Qur’an], that I may follow it, if you are truthful.""",""
  28,50,"But if they answer you not (i.e. do not bring the Book nor believe in your doctrine of Islâmic Monotheism), then know that they only follow their own lusts. And who is more astray than one who follows his own lusts, without guidance from Allâh? Verily Allâh guides not the people who are Zâlimûn (wrong-doers, disobedient to Allâh, and polytheists).",""
