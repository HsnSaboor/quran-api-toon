quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  48,10,"Verily, those who give Bai‘ah (pledge) to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) they are giving Bai‘ah (pledge) to Allâh. The Hand of Allâh is over their hands. Then whosoever breaks his pledge, breaks it only to his own harm; and whosoever fulfils what he has covenanted with Allâh, He will bestow on him a great reward.",""
  48,11,"Those of the bedouins who lagged behind will say to you: ""Our possessions and our families occupied us, so ask forgiveness for us."" They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: ""Who then has any power at all (to intervene) on your behalf with Allâh, if He intends you hurt or intends you benefit? Nay, but Allâh is Ever All-Aware of what you do.",""
  48,12,"""Nay, but you thought that the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and the believers would never return to their families, and that was made fair-seeming in your hearts, and you did think an evil thought and you became a useless people going for destruction.""",""
  48,13,"And whosoever does not believe in Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), then verily, We have prepared for the disbelievers a blazing Fire.<sup>4</sup>","[4] (V.48:13) See the footnote of (V.3:85)."
  48,14,"And to Allâh belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills, and punishes whom He wills. And Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  48,15,"Those who lagged behind will say, when you set forth to take the spoils, ""Allow us to follow you."" They want to change Allâh’s Words. Say: ""You shall not follow us; thus Allâh has said beforehand."" Then they will say: ""Nay, you envy us."" Nay, but they understand not except a little.",""
