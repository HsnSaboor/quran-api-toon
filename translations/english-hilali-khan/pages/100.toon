quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,135,"O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allâh, even though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, be he rich or poor, Allâh is a Better Protector to both (than you). So follow not the lusts (of your hearts), lest you avoid justice; and if you distort your witness or refuse to give it, verily, Allâh is Ever Well-Acquainted with what you do.<sup>37</sup>","[37] (V.4:135) Narrated Anas رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم was asked about the great sins. He said, They are:\na) To join others in worship with Allâh.\nb) To be undutiful to one’s parents.\nc) To kill a person (which Allâh has forbidden to be killed i.e. to commit the crime of murdering).\nd) And to give a false witness.\n(Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.3, Hadîth No.821)."
  4,136,"O you who believe! Believe in Allâh, and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and the Book (the Qur’ân) which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He sent down to those before (him); and whosoever disbelieves in Allâh, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away.",""
  4,137,"Verily, those who believe, then disbelieve, then believe (again), and (again) disbelieve, and go on increasing in disbelief; Allâh will not forgive them, nor guide them on the (Right) Way.",""
  4,138,"Give to the hypocrites the tidings that there is for them a painful torment.<sup>38</sup>","[38] (V.4:138) See ""Hypocrisy"" - Appendix 2."
  4,139,"Those who take disbelievers for Auliyâ’ (protectors or helpers or friends) instead of believers, do they seek honour, power and glory with them? Verily, then to Allâh belongs all honour, power and glory.",""
  4,140,"And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’ân) that when you hear the Verses of Allâh being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allâh will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell.",""
