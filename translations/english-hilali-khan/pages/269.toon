  16,20,"Those whom they (Al-Mushrikûn<sup>10</sup>) invoke besides Allâh have not created anything, but are themselves created.","[10] (V.16:20) Al-Mushrikûn: i.e. polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh, those who worship others along with Allâh, and also those who set up rivals with (or partners to) Allâh."
