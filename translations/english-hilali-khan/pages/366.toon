[Al-Lu’lu’ Wal-Marjan, Vol. 1, Chapter 52, Page 205]\nNarrated Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما: Some pagans who committed murders in great number and committed illegal sexual intercourse excessively, came to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and said: ""O Muhammad! Whatever you say, and invite people to, is good, but we wish if you could inform us whether we can make an expiation for our (past evil) deeds."" So the Divine Verses came: ""Those who invoke not with Allah any other god, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse."" (V.25:68) ""...Except those who repent..."" (V.25:70).\nAnd there was also revealed: ""Say: O My slaves who have transgressed against their ownselves! (by committing sins), despair not of the Mercy of Allah."" (V.39:53). (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 6, Hadîth No. 334)."

  25,76,"Abiding therein - excellent it is as an abode, and as a place to rest in.",""
  25,77,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to the disbelievers): ""My Lord pays attention to you only because of your invocation to Him. But now you have indeed denied (Him). So the torment will be yours for ever (inseparable, permanent punishment).""",""
