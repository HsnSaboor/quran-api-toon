quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  11,6,"And no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allâh. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit (in the uterus, grave). All is in a Clear Book (Al-Lauh Al-Mahfûz - the Book of Decrees with Allâh).",""
  11,7,"And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds. But if you were to say to them: ""You shall indeed be raised up after death,"" those who disbelieve would be sure to say, ""This is nothing but obvious magic.<sup>1</sup>""","[1] (V.11:7) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""The Right (Hand) of Allâh is full, and (its fullness) is not affected by the continuous spending night and day. Do you see what He has spent since He created the heavens and the earth? Yet all that has not decreased what is in His Right Hand. His Throne is over the water and in His other Hand is the Bounty or the Power to bring about death, and He raises some people and brings others down."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.9, Hadith No.515)"
  11,8,"And if We delay the torment for them till a determined term, they are sure to say, ""What keeps it back?"" Verily, on the day it reaches them, nothing will turn it away from them, and they will be surrounded by (or fall in) that at which they used to mock!",""
  11,9,"And if We give man a taste of Mercy from Us, and then withdraw it from him, verily! he is despairing, ungrateful.",""
  11,10,"But if We let him taste good (favour) after evil (poverty and harm) has touched him, he is sure to say: ""Ills have departed from me."" Surely, he is exultant, and boastful (ungrateful to Allâh).",""
  11,11,"Except those who show patience and do righteous good deeds: those, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward (Paradise).",""
  11,12,"So perchance you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) may give up a part of what is revealed unto you, and that your breast feels straitened for it because they say, ""Why has not a treasure been sent down unto him, or an angel has come with him?"" But you are only a warner. And Allâh is a Wakîl (Disposer of affairs, Trustee, Guardian) over all things.",""
