  29,7,"Those who believe [in the Oneness of Allâh (Monotheism) and in Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم , and do not give up their faith because of the harm they receive from the polytheists], and do righteous good deeds, surely, We shall expiate from them their evil deeds and shall reward them according to the best of that which they used to do.<sup>2</sup>","[2] (V.29:7) See the footnote of (V.9:121)."
  29,8,"And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents; but if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return and I shall tell you what you used to do.",""
  29,9,"And for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh and the other articles of Faith)<sup>3</sup> and do righteous good deeds, surely, We shall make them enter with (in the entrance of) the righteous (in Paradise).","[3] (V.29:9) See the footnote (b) of (V.3:85)"
  29,10,"Of mankind are some who say: ""We believe in Allâh."" But if they are made to suffer for the sake of Allâh, they consider the trial of mankind as Allâh’s punishment; and if victory comes from your Lord, (the hypocrites) will say: ""Verily we were with you (helping you)."" Is not Allâh Best Aware of what is in the breasts of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind and jinn).",""
  29,11,"Verily, Allâh knows those who believe, and verily, He knows the hypocrites [i.e. Allâh will test the people with good and hard days to discriminate the good from the wicked, although Allâh knows all that before putting them to test].",""
  29,12,"And those who disbelieve say to those who believe: ""Follow our way and we will verily bear your sins."" Never will they bear anything of their sins. Surely, they are liars.",""
  29,13,"And verily, they shall bear their own loads, and other loads besides their own; and verily, they shall be questioned on the Day of Resurrection about that which they used to fabricate.",""
  29,14,"And indeed We sent Nûh (Noah) to his people, and he stayed among them a thousand years less fifty years [inviting them to believe in the Oneness of Allâh (Monotheism), and discard the false gods and other deities]; and the Deluge overtook them while they were Zâlimûn (wrong-doers, polytheists, disbelievers).",""
