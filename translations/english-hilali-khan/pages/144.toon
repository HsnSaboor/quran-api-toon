quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,125,"And whomsoever Allâh wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islâm; and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky. Thus Allâh puts the wrath on those who believe not.<sup>16</sup>","[16] (V.6:125) If Allâh تعالى wants to do good to a person, He makes him comprehend the religion [the understanding of the Qur’ân and the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم].\nNarrated Mu‘âwiya رضي الله عنه in a Khuthah (religious talk): I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, ""If Allâh wants to do good to a person, He makes him comprehend the religion [the understanding of the Qur’ân and the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم]. I am just a distributor, but the grant is from Allâh. (And remember) that this nation (true Muslims, real followers of Islâmic Monotheism) will remain obedient to Allâh’s Orders [i.e., following strictly Allâh’s Book (the Qur’ân) and the Prophet’s Sunnah (legal ways)] and they will not be harmed by anyone who will oppose them (going on a different path) till Allâh’s Order (Day of Judgement) is established."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadîth No.71)."
  6,126,"And this is the Path of your Lord (the Qur’ân and Islâm) leading Straight. We have detailed Our Revelations for a people who take heed.",""
  6,127,"For them will be the home of peace (Paradise) with their Lord. And He will be their Walî (Helper and Protector) because of what they used to do.",""
  6,128,"And on the Day when He will gather them (all) together (and say): ""O you assembly of jinn! Many did you mislead of men,"" and their Auliyâ’ (friends and helpers) amongst men will say: ""Our Lord! We benefited one from the other, but now we have reached our appointed term which You did appoint for us."" He will say: ""The Fire be your dwelling-place, you will dwell therein forever, except as Allâh may will. Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.""",""
  6,129,"And thus We do make the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) Auliyâ’ (supporters and helpers) of one another (in committing crimes), because of that which they used to earn.",""
  6,130,"O you assembly of jinn and mankind! ""Did not there come to you Messengers from amongst you, reciting unto you My Verses and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?"" They will say: ""We bear witness against ourselves."" It was the life of this world that deceived them. And they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers.",""
  6,131,"This is because your Lord would not destroy the (populations of) towns for their wrong-doing (i.e. associating others in worship along with Allâh) while their people were unaware (so the Messengers were sent).",""
