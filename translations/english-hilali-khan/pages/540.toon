  57,19,"And those who believe in (the Oneness of) Allâh and His Messengers - they are the Siddiqûn (i.e. those followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them), and the martyrs with their Lord, they shall have their reward and their light. But those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) and deny Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) - they shall be the dwellers of the blazing Fire.",""
  57,20,"Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children. (It is) as the likeness of vegetation after rain, thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller; afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw. But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment (for the disbelievers - evil-doers), and (there is) Forgiveness from Allâh and (His) Good Pleasure (for the believers - good-doers). And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.",""
  57,21,"Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord (Allâh), and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth, prepared for those who believe in Allâh and His Messengers. That is the Grace of Allâh which He bestows on whom He is pleased with. And Allâh is the Owner of Great Bounty.",""
  57,22,"No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but it is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (Al-Lauh Al-Mahfûz) before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allâh.<sup>2</sup>","[2] (V.57:22) Narrated Ibn ‘Abbas رضي الله عنهما : Once I was behind the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and he said: ""O boy, I will teach you a few words:\n(a) Be loyal and obedient to Allâh [worship Him (Alone)], remember Him always, obey His Orders. He will save you from every evil and will take care of you in all the spheres of life.\n(b) Be loyal and obedient to Allâh, you will find Him near (in front of you) i.e. He will respond to your requests.\n(c) If you ask, ask Allâh.\n(d) If you seek help, seek help from Allâh.\n(e) Know that if all the people get together in order to benefit you with something, they will not be able to benefit you in anything except what Allâh has decreed for you. And if they all get together in order to harm you with something, they will not be able to harm you in anything except what Allâh has decreed for you.\nThe pens have stopped writings [Divine (Allâh’s) Preordainments]. And (the ink over) the papers (Book of Decrees) has dried."" [This Hadith is quoted in Sahih At-Tirmidhi]."
  57,23,"In order that you may not grieve at the things that you fail to get, nor rejoice over that which has been given to you. And Allâh likes not prideful boasters.",""
  57,24,"Those who are misers and enjoin upon people miserliness - (Allâh is not in need of their charity). And whosoever turns away (from Faith - Allâh’s Monotheism), then Allâh is Rich (Free of all needs), Worthy of all praise.",""
