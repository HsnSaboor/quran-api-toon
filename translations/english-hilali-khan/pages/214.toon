  10,45,"And on the Day when He shall gather (resurrect) them together, (it will be) as if they had not stayed (in the life of this world and graves) but an hour of a day. They will recognise each other. Ruined indeed will be those who denied the Meeting with Allâh, and were not guided.",""
  10,46,"Whether We show you (in your lifetime, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) some of what We promise them (the torment), or We cause you to die - still unto Us is their return, and moreover, Allâh is Witness over what they used to do.",""

  10,52,"Then it will be said to them who wronged themselves: ""Taste you the everlasting torment! Are you recompensed (aught) save what you used to earn?""",""
  10,53,"And they ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) to inform them (saying): ""Is it true (i.e. the torment and the establishment of the Hour - the Day of Resurrection)?"" Say: ""Yes! By my Lord! It is the very truth! and you cannot escape it!""",""
