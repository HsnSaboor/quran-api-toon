  5,58,"And when you proclaim the call for As-Salât [call for the prayer (Adhân)], they take it (but) as a mockery and fun; that is because they are a people who understand not.<sup>20</sup>","[20] (V.5:58) How the Adhân (the call to prayer)* for the prayer was started. And the Statement of Allâh عز وجل:\n""And when you proclaim the call to prayer (Adhân ) they take it (but) as a mockery and fun; that is because they are a people who understand not."" (V.5:58).\nAnd also the Statement of Allâh عز وجل: ""When the call (Adhân ) for the prayer is proclaimed on the day of Friday."" (V.62:9).\nNarrated Anas رضي الله عنه: The people mentioned the fire and the bell (they suggested those as signals to indicate the starting of prayers), and by that they mentioned the Jews and the Christians, then Bilâl was ordered to pronounce Adhân for the prayer by saying its wordings twice (in doubles), and for the Iqâmah (the call for the actual standing for the prayers in rows) by saying its wordings once (in singles) (Iqâmah is pronounced when the people are ready for the prayer). (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadîth No.577).\n* The wording of Adhân : Allâhu-Akbar, Allâhu-Akbar, Allâhu-Akbar, Aâhu-Akbar; Ash-hadu an lâ ilaha illallâh, Ash-hadu an lâ ilâha illallâh; Ash-hadu anna Muhammad-ar Rasûl-Ullâh, Ash-hadu anna Muhammad-ar-Rasûl-Ullâh; Hayya-‘alas-Salâh, Hayya ‘alas-Salâh; Hayya ‘alal-Falâh, Hayya ‘alal-Falâh; Allâhu-Akbar, Allâhu-Akbar; Lâ ilâha illallâh."
  5,59,"Say: ""O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Do you criticize us for no other reason than that we believe in Allâh, and in (the revelation) which has been sent down to us and in that which has been sent down before (us), and that most of you are Fâsiqûn [rebellious and disobedient (to Allâh)]?""",""
  5,60,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to the people of the Scripture): ""Shall I inform you of something worse than that, regarding the recompense from Allâh: those (Jews) who incurred the Curse of Allâh and His Wrath, and those of whom (some) He transformed into monkeys and swines, and those who worshipped Tâghût <sup>21</sup> (false deities); such are worse in rank (on the Day of Resurrection in the Hell-fire), and far more astray from the Right Path (in the life of this world).""","[21] (V.5:60) Tâghût See the footnote of (V.2:256)."
  5,61,"When they come to you, they say: ""We believe."" But in fact they enter with (an intention of) disbelief and they go out with the same. And Allâh knows all what they were hiding.",""
  5,62,"And you see many of them (Jews) hurrying towards sin and transgression, and eating illegal things [as bribes and Ribâ (usury)]. Evil indeed is that which they have been doing.",""
  5,63,"Why do not the rabbis and the religious learned men forbid them from uttering sinful words and from eating illegal things. Evil indeed is that which they have been performing.",""
  5,64,"The Jews say: ""Allâh’s Hand is tied up (i.e. He does not give and spend of His Bounty)."" Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands<sup>22</sup> are widely outstretched. He spends (of His Bounty) as He wills. Verily, the Revelation that has come to you from your Lord (Allâh) increases in most of them (their) obstinate rebellion and disbelief. We have put enmity and hatred amongst them till the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allâh extinguished it; and they (ever) strive to make mischief on the earth. And Allâh does not like the Mufsidûn (mischief-makers).","[22] (V.5:64) Sifât-ullâh صفات الله عز وجل (Qualities of Allâh): [See the footnote of (V.3:73)].\nNarrated Ibn ‘Umar: رضي الله عنهما Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""On the Day of Resurrection, Allâh will grasp the whole (planet of) earth by His Hand, and all the heavens in His Right, and then He will say, ‘I am the King’ "".\nAbu Hurairah said, ""Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ‘Allâh will grasp the (planet of) earth’ "" (Sahih Al-Bukhârî, Vol.9, Hadîth No. 509)."
