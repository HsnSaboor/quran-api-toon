  10,79,"And Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) said: ""Bring me every well-versed sorcerer.""",""
  10,80,"And when the sorcerers came, Mûsâ (Moses) said to them: ""Cast down what you want to cast!""",""
  10,81,"Then when they had cast down, Mûsâ (Moses) said: ""What you have brought is sorcery; Allâh will surely make it of no effect. Verily, Allâh does not set right the work of Al-Mufsidûn (the evil-doers, corrupters).",""
  10,82,"""And Allâh will establish and make apparent the truth by His Words, however much the Mujrimûn (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) may hate it.""",""
  10,83,"But none believed in Mûsâ (Moses) except the offspring of his people, because of the fear of Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his chiefs, lest they should persecute them; and verily, Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) was an arrogant tyrant on the earth, he was indeed one of the Musrifûn (polytheists, sinners and transgressors, those who give up the truth and follow the evil, and commit all kinds of great sins).",""
  10,84,"And Mûsâ (Moses) said: ""O my people! If you have believed in Allâh, then put your trust in Him if you are Muslims (those who submit to Allâh’s Will).""",""
  10,85,"They said: ""In Allâh we put our trust. Our Lord! Make us not a trial for the folk who are Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) (i.e. do not make them overpower us).",""
  10,86,"""And save us by Your Mercy from the disbelieving folk.""",""
  10,87,"And We revealed to Mûsâ (Moses) and his brother (saying): ""Provide dwellings for your people in Egypt, and make your dwellings as places for your worship, and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât ), and give glad tidings to the believers.""",""
  10,88,"And Mûsâ (Moses) said: ""Our Lord! You have indeed bestowed on Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his chiefs splendour and wealth in the life of this world, our Lord! that they may lead men astray from Your Path. Our Lord! Destroy their wealth, and harden their hearts, so that they will not believe until they see the painful torment.""",""
