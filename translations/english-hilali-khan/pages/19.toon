  2,120,"Never will the Jews nor the Christians be pleased with you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) till you follow their religion. Say: ""Verily, the Guidance of Allâh (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism) that is the (only) Guidance. And if you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) were to follow their (Jews and Christians) desires after what you have received of Knowledge (i.e. the Qur’ân), then you would have against Allâh neither any Walî (protector or guardian) nor any helper.",""
  2,121,"Those (who embraced Islâm from Banî Israel) to whom We gave the Book [the Taurât (Torah)] [or those (Muhammad’s صلى الله عليه وسلم companions) to whom We have given the Book (the Qur’ân)] recite it (i.e. obey its orders and follow its teachings) as it should be recited (i.e. followed), they are the ones who believe therein. And whoso disbelieve in it (the Qur’ân), those are they who are the losers. (Tafsir Al-Qurtubî).",""
  2,122,"O Children of Israel! Remember My Favour which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you to the ‘Âlamîn [mankind and jinn (of your time-period, in the past)].",""

  2,124,"And (remember) when the Lord of Ibrâhîm (Abraham) [i.e., Allâh] tried him with (certain) Commands,<sup>24</sup> which he fulfilled. He (Allâh) said (to him), ""Verily, I am going to make you an Imâm (a leader) for mankind (to follow you)."" [Ibrâhîm (Abraham)] said, ""And of my offspring (to make leaders)."" (Allâh) said, ""My Covenant (Prophethood) includes not Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).""","[24] (V.2:124) It is said that those commands were many. Some of them are as follows:\n(A) To invite mankind to the Tauhîd (Islamic Monotheism).\n(B) To show mankind the Manâsik (See V.2:128).\n(C) To practise the characteristics of Al-Fitrah:\nNarrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: I heard the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم saying:\nFive practices are characteristic of Al-Fitrah:\n(1) Circumcision.\n(2) Shaving the pubic hair.\n(3) Cutting the moustaches short.\n(4) Clipping the nails.\n(5) and depilating the hair of the armpits.\n(Sahih Al-Bukhari, Hadith No.779, Vol.7)\nNarrated Ibn Umar رضي الله عنهما Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""Cut the moustaches short and leave the beard (as it is)."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Hadith No.781, Vol.7)\n(D) It is also mentioned that Ibrâhîm عليه السلام was put to test: (1) When he عليه السلام was thrown in the Fire. (2) When he عليه السلام was ordered to slaughter his son. (Tafsir Ibn Kathir)"
  2,125,"And (remember) when We made the House (the Ka‘bah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety. And take you (people) the Maqâm (place) of Ibrâhîm (Abraham) [or the stone on which Ibrâhîm (Abraham) عليه السلام stood while he was building the Ka‘bah] as a place of prayer (for some of your prayers, e.g. two Rak‘at after the Tawâf of the Ka‘bahat Makkah), and We commanded Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) that they should purify My House (the Ka‘bah at Makkah) for those who are circumambulating it, or staying (I‘tikâf), or bowing or prostrating themselves (there, in prayer).",""
  2,126,"And (remember) when Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said, ""My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place of security and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allâh and the Last Day."" He (Allâh) answered: ""As for him who disbelieves, I shall leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the torment of the Fire, and worst indeed is that destination!""",""
