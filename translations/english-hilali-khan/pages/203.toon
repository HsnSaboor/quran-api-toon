(V.9:102)\nNarrated Samurah bin Jundub رضي الله عنه : Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Tonight two (visitors) came to me (in my dream) and took me to a town built with gold bricks and silver bricks. There, we met men who, (by) half of their bodies looked like the most handsome human beings you have ever seen, and (by) the other half, the ugliest human beings you have ever seen. Those two visitors said to those men: ‘Go and dip yourselves in that river.’ So they dipped themselves therein and then came to us, their ugliness having disappeared and they were in the most handsome shape. The visitors said, ‘This is the ‘Adn Paradise, and that is your dwelling place.’ Then they added, ‘As for those people who were half ugly and half handsome, they were those who have mixed deeds that were good with deeds that were evil, but Allâh forgave them.’ "" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadith No.196)."

  9,105,"And say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) ""Do deeds! Allâh will see your deeds, and (so will) His Messenger and the believers. And you will be brought back to the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. Then He will inform you of what you used to do.""",""
  9,106,"And others are made to await for Allâh’s Decree, whether He will punish them or will forgive them. And Allâh is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",""
