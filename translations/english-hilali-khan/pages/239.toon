quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  12,31,"So when she heard of their accusation, she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them; she gave each one of them a knife (to cut the foodstuff with), and she said [(to Yûsuf (Joseph)]: ""Come out before them."" Then, when they saw him, they exalted him (at his beauty) and (in their astonishment) cut their hands. They said: ""How perfect is Allâh (or Allâh forbid)! No man is this! This is none other than a noble angel!""",""
  12,32,"She said: ""This is he (the young man) about whom you did blame me, and I did seek to seduce him, but he refused. And now if he refuses to obey my order, he shall certainly be cast into prison, and will be one of those who are disgraced.""",""
  12,33,"He said: ""O my Lord! Prison is dearer to me than that to which they invite me. Unless You turn away their plot from me, I will feel inclined towards them and be one (of those who commit sin and deserve blame or those who do deeds) of the ignorant.""",""
  12,34,"So his Lord answered his invocation and turned away from him their plot. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.",""
  12,35,"Then it occurred to them, after they had seen the proofs (of his innocence), to imprison him for a time.",""
  12,36,"And there entered with him two young men in the prison. One of them said: ""Verily, I saw myself (in a dream) pressing wine."" The other said: ""Verily, I saw myself (in a dream) carrying bread on my head and birds were eating thereof."" (They said): ""Inform us of the interpretation of this. Verily, we think you are one of the Muhsinûn (doers of good).""",""
  12,37,"He said: ""No food will come to you (in wakefulness or in dream) as your provision, but I will inform (in wakefulness) its interpretation before it (the food) comes. This is of that which my Lord has taught me. Verily, I have abandoned the religion of a people that believe not in Allâh and are disbelievers in the Hereafter (i.e. the Kan‘anyyûn of Egypt who were polytheists and used to worship sun and other false deities).",""
