  3,149,"O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will send you back on your heels, and you will turn back (from Faith) as losers.<sup>29</sup>","[29] (V.3:149) What is said about residence (staying) in the land of Ash-Shirk (polytheism i.e. the land where polytheism is practised). Narrated Samurah bin Jundubرضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""Anybody (from among the Muslims) who meets, gathers together, lives, and stays (permanently) with a Mushrik (polytheist or a disbeliever in the Oneness of Allâh, etc.) and agrees to his ways, opinion, etc. and (enjoys) his living with him (Mushrik) then he (that Muslim) is like him (Mushrik). (This Hadîth indicates that a Muslim should not stay in a non-Muslim country, he must emigrate to a Muslim country, where Islâm is practised.)"" [The Book of Jihâd, Abu Dâwûd]."
  3,150,"Nay, Allâh is your Maulâ (Patron, Lord, Helper, Protector), and He is the Best of helpers.",""
  3,151,"We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because they joined others in worship with Allâh, for which He had sent no authority; their abode will be the Fire and how evil is the abode of the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).",""
  3,152,"And Allâh did indeed fulfil His Promise to you when you were killing them (your enemy) with His Permission; until (the moment) you lost your courage and fell to disputing about the order, and disobeyed after He showed you (of the booty) which you love. Among you are some that desire this world and some that desire the Hereafter. Then He made you flee from them (your enemy), that He might test you. But surely, He forgave you, and Allâh is Most Gracious to the believers.",""
  3,153,"(And remember) when you ran away (dreadfully) without even casting a side glance at anyone, and the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) was in your rear calling you back. There did Allâh give you one distress after another by way of requital to teach you not to grieve for that which had escaped you, nor for that which had befallen you. And Allâh is Well-Aware of all that you do.",""
