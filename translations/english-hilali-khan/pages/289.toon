  17,67,"And when harm touches you upon the sea, those that you call upon vanish from you except Him (Allâh Alone). But when He brings you safe to land, you turn away (from Him). And man is ever ungrateful<sup>11</sup>.","[11] (V.17:67) Ibn Kathir in his Book of Tafsîr as regards this Verse (17:67) said: ‘Ikrimah bin Abî Jahl fled from Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم (at the time) when Makkah was conquered. He rode over the (Red) Sea to cross over to Ethiopia, but (as they proceeded), a heavy stormy wind overtook their boat, and huge waves came to them from all sides, and they thought that they are encircled therein. The people of the boat said to one another ""None can save you except Allâh (the Only True God of the heavens and earth). So invoke (call upon) Him (Allâh) (by making your Faith pure for Him Alone and none else) to deliver you safe (from drowning)."" ‘Ikrimah said to himself. ‘By Allâh if none can benefit in the sea except Allâh (Alone) then no doubt none can benefit over the land except Allâh (Alone). O Allâh! I promise You that if You delivered me safe from this, I will go and put my hands in the hands of (Prophet) Muhammad and surely I will find him full of pity, kindness and mercy.’ So they were delivered safe (by Allâh), and returned to their sea-shore and came out of the sea. ‘Ikrimah then proceeded to Allâh’s Messenger, Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم (narrated his story), embraced Islâm (just as he promised Allâh), and became a perfect Muslim."" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir)."
  17,68,"Do you then feel secure that He will not cause a side of the land to swallow you up, or that He will not send against you a violent sand-storm? Then, you shall find no Wakîl (guardian - one to guard you from the torment).",""
  17,69,"Or do you feel secure that He will not send you back a second time to sea and send against you a hurricane of wind and drown you because of your disbelief? Then you will not find any avenger therein against Us.",""
  17,70,"And indeed We have honoured the Children of Adam, and We have carried them on land and sea, and have provided them with At-Tayyibât (lawful good things), and have preferred them above many of those whom We have created with a marked preferment.",""
  17,71,"(And remember) the Day when We shall call together call human beings with their (respective) Imâm [their Prophets, or their records of good and bad deeds, or their Holy Books like the Qur’ân, the Taurât (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), the leaders whom the people followed in this world.]. So whosoever is given his record in his right hand, such will read their records, and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least.",""
  17,72,"And whoever is blind in this world (i.e., does not see Allâh’s Signs and believes not in Him), will be blind in the Hereafter, and more astray from the Path.",""
  17,73,"Verily, they were about to tempt you away from that which We have revealed (the Qur’ân) unto you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم), to fabricate something other than it against Us, and then they would certainly have taken you a Khalîl (an intimate friend)!",""
  17,74,"And had We not made you stand firm, you would nearly have inclined to them a little.",""
  17,75,"In that case We would have made you taste a double portion (of punishment) in this life and a double portion (of punishment) after death. And then you would have found none to help you against Us.",""
