  28,73,"It is out of His Mercy that He has made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein (i.e. during the night) and that you may seek of His Bounty (i.e. during the day) - and in order that you may be grateful.",""
  28,74,"And (remember) the Day when He (your Lord - Allâh) will call to them (those who worshipped others along with Allâh), and will say: ""Where are My (so-called) partners, whom you used to assert?""",""
  28,75,"And We shall take out from every nation a witness, and We shall say: ""Bring your proof."" Then they shall know that the truth is with Allâh (Alone), and the lies (false gods) which they invented will disappear from them.",""
  28,76,"Verily, Qârûn (Korah) was of Mûsâ’s (Moses) people, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. And We gave him of the treasures, that of which the keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men. Remember when his people said to him: ""Do not exult (with riches, being ungrateful to Allâh). Verily Allâh likes not those who exult (with riches, being ungrateful to Allâh).",""
  28,77,"""But seek, with that (wealth) which Allâh has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world; and do good as Allâh has been good to you, and seek not mischief in the land. Verily, Allâh likes not the Mufsidûn (those who commit great crimes and sins, oppressors, tyrants, mischief-makers, corrupters).""",""
