  63,5,"And when it is said to them: ""Come, so that the Messenger of Allâh may ask forgiveness from Allâh for you,"" they twist their heads, and you would see them turning away their faces in pride.<sup>2</sup>","[2] (V.63:5) See the footnote of (V.22:9)."
  63,6,"It is equal to them whether you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) ask forgiveness or ask not forgiveness for them, Allâh will never forgive them. Verily, Allâh guides not the people who are the Fâsiqîn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh).<sup>3</sup>","[3] (V.63:6) See the Qur’ân (V.4:138-145)."
  63,7,"They are the ones who say: ""Spend not on those who are with Allâh’s Messenger, until they desert him."" And to Allâh belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites comprehend not.",""
  63,8,"They (hyprocrites) say: ""If we return to Al-Madinah, indeed the more honourable (‘Abdullâh bin Ubai bin Salûl, the chief of hyprocrites at Al-Madinah) will expel therefrom the meaner (i.e. Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم)."" But honour, power and glory belong to Allâh, and to His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and to the believers, but the hypocrites know not.",""
  63,9,"O you who believe! Let not your properties or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allâh. And whosoever does that, then they are the losers.",""
  63,10,"And spend (in charity) of that with which We have provided you before death comes to one of you, and he says: ""My Lord! If only You would give me respite for a little while (i.e. return to the worldly life), then I should giveSadaqah (i.e. Zakât ) of my wealth,<sup>4</sup> and be among the righteous [i.e. perform Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) and other good deeds].","[4] (V.63:10).\nA) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Everyday two angels come down from heaven and one of them says, ‘O Allâh! Compensate every person who spends in Your Cause,’ and the other (angel) says, ‘O Allâh! Destroy every miser.’"" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.2, Hadith No.522).\nB) The performance of Hajj is an enjoined duty and its superiority, and the Statement of Allâh عز وجل: ""Hajj (pilgrimage) to the House (Ka‘bah), is a duty that mankind owes to Allâh, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence); and whoever disbelieves [i.e. denies Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah), then he is a disbeliever of Allâh], then Allâh stands not in need of any of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind and jinn)."" (V.3:97).\nC) Islâm demolishes all the previous evil deeds and so do migration (for Allâh’s sake) and Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) [Al-Lû’lû’ wal-Marjân, Vol. 1, Chapter 52, Page 205] (Sahih Muslim, Vol.1, Chapter 52, Page 78)\nD) See the footnote of (V.3:180)."
  63,11,"And Allâh grants respite to none when his appointed time (death) comes. And Allâh is All-Aware of what you do.",""
