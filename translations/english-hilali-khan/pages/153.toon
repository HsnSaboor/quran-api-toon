  7,23,"They said: ""Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers.""",""
  7,24,"(Allâh) said: ""Get down, one of you is an enemy to the other [i.e. Adam, Hawwâ’ (Eve), and Shaitân (Satan)]. On earth will be a dwelling-place for you and an enjoyment for a time.""",""
  7,25,"He said: ""Therein you shall live, and therein you shall die, and from it you shall be brought out (i.e. resurrected).""",""
  7,26,"O Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts) and as an adornment; and the raiment of righteousness, that is better. Such are among the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh, that they may remember (i.e. leave falsehood and follow truth<sup>2</sup>).","[2] (V.7:26) It is said that the pagan Arabs in the Pre-Islâmic Period of Ignorance used to do Tawâf (going round) of the Ka‘bah in a naked state. So when Islâm became victorious and Makkah was conquered, the pagans and the polytheists were forbidden to enter Makkah, and none was allowed to do Tawâf of the Ka‘bah in a naked state."
  7,27,"O Children of Adam! Let not Shaitân (Satan) deceive you, as he got your parents [Adam and Hawwâ’ (Eve)] out of Paradise, stripping them of their raiments, to show them their private parts. Verily, he and Qabîluhu (his soldiers from the jinn or his tribe) see you from where you cannot see them. Verily, We made the Shayâtin (devils) Auliyâ’ (protectors and helpers) for those who believe not.",""
  7,28,"And when they commit a Fâhishah (evil deed, going round the Ka‘bah in naked state, and every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse), they say: ""We found our fathers doing it, and Allâh has commanded it on us."" Say: ""Nay, Allâh never commands Fâhishah. Do you say of Allâh what you know not?""",""
  7,29,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): My Lord has commanded justice and (said) that you should face Him only (i.e. worship none but Allâh and face the Qiblah, i.e. the Ka‘bah at Makkah during prayers) in every place of worship, in prayers (and not to face other false deities and idols), and invoke Him only making your religion sincere to Him (by not joining in worship any partner with Him and with the intention that you are doing your deeds for Allâh’s sake only). As He brought you (into being) in the beginning, so shall you be brought into being [on the Day of Resurrection in two groups, one as a blessed one (believers), and the other as a wretched one (disbelievers)].",""
  7,30,"A group He has guided, and a group deserved to be in error; (because) surely they took the Shayâtîn (devils) as Auliyâ’ (protectors and helpers) instead of Allâh, and think that they are guided.",""
