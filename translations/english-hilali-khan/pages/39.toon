  2,238,"Guard strictly (five obligatory) As-Salawât (the prayers) especially the middle Salât (i.e. the best prayer - ‘Asr )<sup>62</sup>. And stand before Allâh with obedience [and do not speak to others during the Salât (prayers)].","[62] (V.2:238).\na) The sin of one who misses the ‘Asr prayer (intentionally):\n""Narrated Ibn ‘Umar رضي الله عنهما: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Whoever misses the ‘Asr prayers (intentionally), then it is as if he lost his family and property."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadîth No. 527).\n(b) One who omits (does not offer) the ‘Asr prayer (intentionally):*\nNarrated Abu Al-Malîh: We were with Buraidah in a battle on a cloudy day and he said, ""Offer the ‘Asr prayer early as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Whoever omits the ‘Asr prayer, all his (good) deeds will be lost."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadîth No.528).\n* i.e. The one who omits (does not offer) the ‘Asr prayer intentionally until its stated time is over and if he prays after that time, then it is useless."
  2,239,"And if you fear (an enemy), perform Salât (pray) on foot or riding.<sup>63</sup> And when you are in safety, offer the Salât (prayer) in the manner He has taught you, which you knew not (before).","[63] (V.2:239) Narrated Sâlih Khawwat or Sahl bin Abî Hathmah concerning those who witnessed the Fear Prayer that was performed in the battle of Dhat-ur-Riqa‘ in the company of Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم: One batch lined up behind him while another batch (lined up) facing the enemy. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم led the batch that was with him in one Rak‘ah, and he stayed in the standing posture while that batch completed their (two Rak‘at) prayer by themselves and went away, lining in the face of the enemy, while the other batch came and he (i.e. the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم) offered his remaining Rak‘ah with them, and then, kept on sitting till they completed their prayer by themselves, and he then finished his prayer with Taslîm along with them. [Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 5, Hadîth No.451]."
  2,240,"And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year’s maintenance and residence without turning them out, but if they (wives) leave, there is no sin on you for that which they do of themselves, provided it is honourable (e.g. lawful marriage). And Allâh is All-Mighty, All-Wise<sup>64</sup>.","[64] (V.2:240): The provision of this Verse has been abrogated by Verse (4:12)"

  2,243,"Did you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) not think of those who went forth from their homes in thousands, fearing death? Allâh said to them, ""Die"". And then He restored them to life. Truly, Allâh is full of bounty to mankind, but most men thank not.",""
