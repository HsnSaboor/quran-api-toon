  3,84,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""We believe in Allâh and in what has been sent down to us, and what was sent down to Ibrâhîm (Abraham), Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael), Ishâq (Isaac), Ya‘qûb (Jacob) and Al-Asbât [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya‘qûb (Jacob)] and what was given to Mûsâ (Moses), ‘Îsâ (Jesus) and the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between one another among them and to Him (Allâh) we have submitted (in Islâm).""",""
  3,85,"And whoever seeks a religion other than Islâm, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers<sup>17</sup>.","[17] (V.3:85).\na) It is obligatory to have Belief in the Messengership of the Prophet (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم). Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""By Him (Allâh) in Whose Hand Muhammad’s soul is, there is none from amongst the Jews and the Christians (of these present nations) who hears about me and then dies without believing in the Message with which I have been sent (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism), but he will be from the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire."" (Sahih Muslim , the Book of Faith, Vol.1, Hadith No.240). [See also (V.3:116)]\nb) The asking of (angel) Jibrael (Gabriel) from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم about Belief, Islâm, Ihsân (perfection) and the knowledge of the Hour (Doomsday), and their explanation given to him by the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. Then the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said (to his companions): ""Jibrael (Gabriel) عليه السلام came to teach you your religion."" So the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم regarded all that as a religion. And all that which the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم explained to the delegation of ‘Abdûl-Qais was a part of faith. (See Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadîth No.50 and 87) And the Statement of Allâhعز وجل : ""And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him."" (3:85).\nNarrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : One day while the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم was sitting in the company of some people, (The angel) Jibrael (Gabriel) عليه السلام came and asked, ""What is Faith?"" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم replied, ""Faith is to believe in Allâh, His angels, (the) meeting with Him, His messengers, and to believe in Resurrection.""* Then he further asked, ""What is Islâm?"" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم replied, ""To worship Allâh Alone and none else, to perform As-Salât (Iqamât-as-Salât), to give the Zakât and to observe Saum (fasts) during the month of Ramadân,""** then he further asked, ""What is Ihsân (perfection)?"" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم replied, ""To worship Allâh عز وجل as if you see Him, and if you cannot achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is looking at you."" Then he further asked, ""When will the Hour be established?"" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم replied, ""The answerer has no better knowledge than the questioner. But I will inform you about its portents:\n(1) When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master.\n(2) When the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing with others in the construction of higher buildings. And the Hour is one of the five things which nobody knows except Allâh.\nThe Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم then recited: ""Verily, the knowledge of the Hour is with Allâh (Alone)."" (31:34). Then that man (Gabriel عليه السلام) left and the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم asked his Companions to call him back, but they could not see him. Then the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""That was (angel) Gabriel عليه السلام who came to teach the people their religion.""\nAbu ‘Abdullâh رضي الله عنه said: He (the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم) considered all that as a part of faith. (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadîth No.47).\n*In this Hadîth, only 4 articles are mentioned, while in another Hadîth, 6 articles are mentioned: (i) Allâh, (ii) His Angels, (iii) His Books (The Torah, The Gospel, The Qur’ân and all the other Holy Books revealed by Allâh), (iv) His Messengers, (v) Day of Resurrection and (vi) Al-Qadar (Divine Pre-ordainments), i.e. whatever Allâh has ordained, must come to pass.\n**Again the principles of Islâm mentioned here are 4, but in other narrations, they are 5 - 5th is the pilgrimage (Haji ) to Makkah for the one who can afford it once in a lifetime."
  3,86,"How shall Allâh guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and after they bore witness that the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) is true and after clear proofs had come unto them? And Allâh guides not the people who are Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).",""
  3,87,"They are those whose recompense is that on them (rests) the Curse of Allâh, of the angels, and of all mankind.",""
  3,88,"They will abide therein (Hell). Neither will their torment be lightened, nor will it be delayed or postponed (for a while).",""
  3,89,"Except for those who repent after that and do righteous deeds. Verily, Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  3,90,"Verily, those who disbelieved after their Belief and then went on increasing in their disbelief (i.e. disbelief in the Qur’ân and in Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) - never will their repentance be accepted [because they repent only by their tongues and not from their hearts]. And they are those who are astray.",""
  3,91,"Verily, those who disbelieved, and died while they were disbelievers, the (whole) earth full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them even if they offered it as a ransom<sup>18</sup>. For them is a painful torment and they will have no helpers.","[18] (V.3:91). Narrated Anas bin Mâlik رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم used to say, ""A disbeliever will be asked: ‘Suppose you had as much gold as to fill the earth, would you offer it to ransom yourself (from the Hell-Fire)?’ He will reply, ‘Yes.’ Then it will be said to him, ‘You were asked for something easier than that (to join none in worship) with Allâh (i.e. to accept Islâm, but you refused.)’ "" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 8, Hadîth No. 546)."
