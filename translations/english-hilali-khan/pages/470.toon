  40,26,"Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) said: ""Leave me to kill Mûsâ (Moses), and let him call his Lord (to stop me from killing him)! I fear that he may change your religion, or that he may cause mischief to appear in the land!""",""
  40,27,"Mûsâ (Moses) said: ""Verily I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant who believes not in the Day of Reckoning!""",""
  40,28,"And a believing man of Fir‘aun’s (Pharaoh) family, who hid his faith said: ""Would you kill a man because he says: My Lord is Allâh, and he has come to you with clear signs (proofs) from your Lord? And if he is a liar, upon him will be (the sin of) his lie; but if he is telling the truth, then some of that (calamity) wherewith he threatens you will befall on you."" Verily, Allâh guides not one who is a Musrif (a polytheist, or a murderer who shed blood without a right, or those who commit great sins, oppressor, transgressor), a liar!",""
  40,29,"""O my people! Yours is the kingdom today, you being dominant in the land. But who will save us from the Torment of Allâh, should it befall us?"" Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) said: ""I show you only that which I see (correct), and I guide you only to the path of right policy!""",""
  40,30,"And he who believed said: ""O my people! Verily, I fear for you a fate like that day (of disaster) of the Confederates (of old)!",""
  40,31,"""Like the fate of the people of Nûh (Noah), and ‘Âd, and Thamûd and those who came after them. And Allâh wills no injustice for (His) slaves.",""
  40,32,"""And, O my people! Verily, I fear for you the Day when there will be mutual calling (between the people of Hell and of Paradise).""",""
  40,33,"A Day when you will turn your backs and flee having no protector from Allâh. And whomsoever Allâh sends astray, for him there is no guide.",""
