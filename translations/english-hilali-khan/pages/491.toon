  43,23,"And similarly, We sent not a warner before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: ""We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.""",""
  43,24,"(The warner) said: ""Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following?"" They said: ""Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.""",""
  43,25,"So We took revenge on them, then see what was the end of those who denied (Islâmic Monotheism).",""
  43,26,"And (remember) when Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said to his father and his people: ""Verily, I am innocent of what you worship,",""
  43,27,"""Except Him (i.e. I worship none but Allâh Alone) Who did create me; and verily He will guide me.""",""
  43,28,"And he made it [i.e. Lâ ilâha illallâh (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh Alone)] a Word lasting among his offspring, (True Monotheism), that they may turn back (i.e. to repent to Allâh or receive admonition).",""
  43,29,"Nay, but I gave (the good things of this life) to these (polytheists) and their fathers to enjoy, till there came to them the truth (the Qur’ân), and a Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) making things clear.",""
  43,30,"And when the truth (this Qur’ân) came to them, they (the disbelievers in this Qur’ân) said: ""This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.""",""
  43,31,"And they say: ""Why is not this Qur’ân sent down to some great man of the two towns (Makkah and Tâ’if)?""",""
  43,32,"Is it they who would portion out the Mercy of your Lord? It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world, and We raised some of them above others in ranks, so that some may employ others in their work. But the Mercy (Paradise) of your Lord (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) is better than the (wealth of this world) which they amass.",""
  43,33,"And were it not that mankind would have become of one community (all disbelievers, desiring worldly life only), We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious (Allâh), silver roofs for their houses, and elevators whereby they ascend,",""
