quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,141,"And that Allâh may test (or purify) the believers (from sins) and destroy the disbelievers.",""
  3,142,"Do you think that you will enter Paradise before Allâh tests those of you who fought (in His Cause) and (also) tests those who are As-Sâbirûn (the patient)?",""
  3,143,"You did indeed wish for death (Ash-Shahâdah - martyrdom) before you met it. Now you have seen it openly with your own eyes.",""
  3,144,"Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allâh; and Allâh will give reward to those who are grateful.",""
  3,145,"And no person can ever die except by Allâh’s Leave and at an appointed term. And whoever desires a reward in (this) world, We shall give him of it; and whoever desires a reward in the Hereafter, We shall give him thereof. And We shall reward the grateful.",""
  3,146,"And many a Prophet (i.e. many from amongst the Prophets) fought (in Allâh’s Cause) and along with him (fought) large bands of religious learned men. But they never lost heart for that which did befall them in Allâh’s Way, nor did they weaken nor degrade themselves. And Allâh loves As-Sâbirûn (the patient).",""
  3,147,"And they said nothing but: ""Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and our transgressions (in keeping our duties to You), establish our feet firmly, and give us victory over the disbelieving folk.""",""
  3,148,"So Allâh gave them the reward of this world, and the excellent reward of the Hereafter. And Allâh loves Al-Muhsinûn (the good-doers - See the footnote of V.3:134 and of V.9:120).",""
