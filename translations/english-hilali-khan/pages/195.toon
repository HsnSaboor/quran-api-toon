  9,48,"Verily, they had plotted sedition before, and had upset matters for you, until the truth (victory) came and the Decree of Allâh (His religion, Islâm) became manifest though they hated it.",""
  9,49,"And among them is he who says: ""Grant me leave (to be exempted from Jihâd) and put me not into trial."" Surely, they have fallen into trial. And verily, Hell is surrounding the disbelievers.",""
  9,50,"If good befalls you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), it grieves them, but if a calamity overtakes you, they say: ""We took our precaution beforehand"" and they turn away rejoicing.",""
  9,51,"Say: ""Nothing shall ever happen to us except what Allâh has ordained for us.<sup>13</sup> He is our Maulâ (Lord, Helper and Protector)."" And in Allâh let the believers put their trust.","[13] (V.9:51) See the footnote of (V.57:22)."
  9,52,"Say: ""Do you wait for us (anything) except one of the two best things (martyrdom or victory); while we await for you either that Allâh will afflict you with a punishment from Himself or at our hands. So wait, we too are waiting with you.""",""

  9,54,"And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allâh and in His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and that they came not to As-Salât (the prayer) except in a lazy state,<sup>14</sup> and that they offer not contributions but unwillingly.","[14] (V.9:54) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""No Salât (prayer) is more heavy (harder) for the hypocrites than the Fajr and the ‘Ishâ prayer; but if they knew the reward for these Salât (prayers) at their respective times, they would certainly, present themselves (in the mosques) even if they had to crawl."" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, ""Certainly, I intended (or was about) to order the Mu‘adhdhin (call-maker) to pronounce Iqâmah and order a man to lead the Salât (prayer), and then take a fire flame to burn all those (men along with their houses) who had not yet left their houses for the Salât (prayer) (in the mosques).""
