  16,111,"(Remember) the Day when every person will come up pleading for himself, and every one will be paid in full for what he did (good or evil, belief or disbelief in the life of this world) and they will not be dealt with unjustly.",""
  16,112,"And Allâh puts forward the example of a township (Makkah), that dwelt secure and well-content: its provision coming to it in abundance from every place, but it (its people) denied the Favours of Allâh (with ungratefulness). So Allâh made it taste extreme of hunger (famine) and fear, because of that (evil, i.e. denying Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) which they (its people) used to do<sup>22</sup>.","[22] (V.16:112) Narrated Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""I was shown the Hell-fire and that the majority of its dwellers were women who were disbelievers or ungrateful."" He was asked, ""Do they disbelieve in Allâh?"" (or are they ungrateful to Allâh?) He replied, ""They are ungrateful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favours and the good (charitable deeds) done to them. If you have always been good (benevolent) to one of them for a period of time and then she sees something in you (not of her liking), she will say, ‘I have never seen any good from you.’ "" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.1, Hadith No.28)."
  16,113,"And verily, there had come unto them a Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) from among themselves, but they denied him, so the torment overtook them while they were Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).",""
  16,114,"So eat of the lawful and good food<sup>23</sup> which Allâh has provided for you. And be grateful for the Favour of Allâh, if it is He Whom you worship.","[23] (V.16:114) The meat of cattle beast which Allâh has made lawful to you (Muslims) and are slaughtered according to Islâmic way."
  16,115,"He has forbidden you only Al-Maitah (meat of a dead animal), blood, the flesh of swine, and any animal which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allâh (or has been slaughtered for idols or on which Allâh’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering). But if one is forced by necessity, without wilful disobedience, and not transgressing, - then, Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  16,116,"And say not concerning that which your tongues put forth falsely: ""This is lawful and this is forbidden,"" so as to invent lies against Allâh. Verily, those who invent lies against Allâh will never prosper.",""
  16,117,"A passing brief enjoyment (will be theirs), but they will have a painful torment.",""
  16,118,"And unto those who are Jews, We have forbidden such things as We have mentioned to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) before [see Verse 6:146]. And We wronged them not, but they used to wrong themselves.",""
