quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  22,65,"See you not that Allâh has subjected to you (mankind) all that is on the earth, and the ships that sail through the sea by His Command? He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth except by His Leave. Verily, Allâh is, for mankind, Full of Kindness, Most Merciful.",""
  22,66,"It is He, Who gave you life, and then will cause you to die, and will again give you life (on the Day of Resurrection). Verily man is indeed an ingrate.",""
  22,67,"For every nation We have ordained religious ceremonies [e.g. slaughtering of the cattle during the three days of stay at Mîna (Makkah) during the Hajj (pilgrimage)] which they must follow; so let them (the pagans) not dispute with you on the matter (i.e. to eat of the cattle which you slaughter, and not to eat of the cattle which Allâh kills by its natural death), but invite them to your Lord. Verily you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) indeed are on the (true) straight guidance (i.e. the true religion of Islâmic Monotheism).",""
  22,68,"And if they argue with you (as regards the slaughtering of the sacrifices), say ""Allâh knows best of what you do.",""
  22,69,"""Allâh will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein you used to differ.""",""
  22,70,"Know you not that Allâh knows all that is in the heaven and on the earth? Verily, it is (all) in the Book (Al-Lauh-al-Mahfûz). Verily that is easy for Allâh.",""
  22,71,"And they worship besides Allâh others for which He has sent down no authority, and of which they have no knowledge; and for the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers, polytheists and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh) there is no helper.",""
  22,72,"And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, you will notice a denial on the faces of the disbelievers! They are nearly ready to attack with violence those who recite Our Verses to them. Say: ""Shall I tell you of something worse than that? The Fire (of Hell) which Allâh has promised to those who disbelieved, and worst indeed is that destination!""",""
