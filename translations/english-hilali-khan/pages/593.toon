  89,2,"By the ten nights (i.e. the first ten days of the month of Dhul-Hijjah)<sup>1</sup>,","[1] (V.89:2) Narrated Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""No good deeds done on other days are superior to those done on these (first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah)."" Then some Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Not even Jihâd ?"" He replied, ""Not even Jihâd, except that of a man who does it by putting himself and his property in danger (for Allâh’s sake) and does not return with any of those things.""

Some say: Even is the Day of Slaughtering of the Sacrifices, i.e. 10th of Dhul-Hijjah, and Odd is the Day of ‘Arafah (Hajj ), i.e. 9th of Dhul-Hijjah. Others say: Even is all the creatures and Odd is Allâh. Some say it is the compulsory congregational prayer, i.e. Maghrib is Witr , and the other four prayers are Shaf‘"
