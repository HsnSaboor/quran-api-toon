Verily, We have prepared Hell as an entertainment for the disbelievers (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism)<sup>8</sup>.","[8] (V.18:102) Almighty Allâh says: ""They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords (by obeying them in things that they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by Allâh) besides Allâh, and (they also took as their Lord) Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] to worship none but one Ilâh (God - Allâh), Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Praise and Glory be to Him, (far above is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him).""
