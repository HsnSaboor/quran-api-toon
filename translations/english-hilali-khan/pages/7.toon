  2,41,"And believe in what I have sent down (this Qur’ân), confirming that which is with you, [the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], and be not the first to disbelieve therein, and buy [get (تاخذ اجرا)] not with My Verses [the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] a small price (i.e. getting a small gain by selling My Verses), and fear Me and Me Alone. (Tafsîr At-Tabarî ).",""
  2,42,"And mix not truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth [i.e. Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is Allâh’s Messenger and his qualities are written in your Scriptures, the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] while you know (the truth).<sup>10</sup>","[10] (V.2:42) Narrated ‘Atâ bin Yasâr: I met ‘Abdullâh bin ‘Amr bin Al-‘Aas and asked him, ""Tell me about the description of Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم which is mentioned in the Taurât (Torah)."" He replied, ""Yes. By Allâh, he is described in the Taurât (Torah) with some of the qualities attributed to him in the Qur’ân as follows: ‘O Prophet! We have sent you as a witness (for Allâh’s True Religion). And a giver of glad tidings (to the faithful believers). And a warner (to the disbelievers), and a guardian of the illiterates. You are My slave and My Messenger I have named you Al-Mutawakkil (who depends upon Allâh). You are neither discourteous, harsh nor a noise-maker in the markets, and you do not do evil to those who do evil to you, but you deal with them with forgiveness and kindness. Allâh will not let him (the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم) die till he makes straight the crooked people by making them say: ‘La ilâha illallâh ’ (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh), by which ‘blind eyes, deaf ears and closed hearts’ will be opened.""

  2,43,"And perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât and bow down (or submit yourselves with obedience to Allâh) along with Ar-Raki‘ûn<sup>11</sup>.","[11] (V.2:43) Ar-Râki‘ûn: Those who bow down or submit themselves with obedience to Allâh with Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم as the Muslims have done, i.e., embrace Islâm (worshipping none but Allâh Alone and doing good with the only intention of seeking Allâh’s Pleasure)."
  2,44,"Enjoin you Al-Birr (piety and righteousness and each and every act of obedience to Allâh) on the people and you forget (to practise it) yourselves,<sup>12</sup> while you recite the Scripture [the Taurât (Torah)]! Have you then no sense?","[12] (V.2:44) Narrated Abu Wâ’il رضي الله عنه: Someone said to Usâma, Will you not talk to this (‘Uthmân)?"" Usâma said, ""I talked to him (secretly) without being the first man to open an evil door. I will never tell a ruler who rules over two men or more that he is good after I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, ‘A man will be brought and put in Hell (Fire) and he will circumambulate (go round and round) in Hell (Fire) like a donkey of a (flour) grinding mill, and all the people of Hell (Fire) will gather around him and will say to him ‘O so and so! Didn‘t you use to order others for Al-Ma‘rûf (Islâmic Monotheism and all that is good) and forbid them from Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and that is evil)?’ That man will say, ‘I used to order others to do Al-Ma‘rûf (Islâmic Monotheism and all that is good) but I myself never used to do it, and I used to forbid others from Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that is evil) but I myself used to do Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that is evil)’"".

  2,45,"And seek help in patience and As-Salât (the prayer) and truly it is extremely heavy and hard except for Al-Khâshi‘ûn [i.e. the true believers in Allâh - those who obey Allâh with full submission, fear much from His Punishment, and believe in His Promise (Paradise) and in His Warnings (Hell)].",""
  2,46,"(They are those) who are certain that they are going to meet their Lord, and that unto Him they are going to return.",""
