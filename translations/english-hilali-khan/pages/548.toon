  59,21,"Had We sent down this Qur’ân on a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rent asunder by the fear of Allâh. Such are the parables which We put forward to mankind that they may reflect.<sup>3</sup>","[3] (V.59:21) Narrated Jâbir bin ‘Abdullâh رضي الله عنهما: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم used to stand by a tree or a date-palm on Friday. Then an Ansâri woman or man said, ""O Allâh’s Messenger! Shall we make a pulpit for you?"" He replied, ""If you wish."" So they made a pulpit for him and when it was Friday, he proceeded towards the pulpit [for delivering the Khutbah (religious talk)]. The date-palm cried like a child! The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم descended (from the pulpit) and embraced it while it continued moaning like a child being quietened. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""It was crying for (missing) what it used to hear of religious knowledge given near it."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.4, Hadîth No. 784)."

Glory be to Allâh! (High is He) above all that they associate as partners with Him.",""
  59,24,"He is Allâh, the Creator, the Inventor of all things, the Bestower of forms. To Him belong the Best Names.<sup>4</sup> All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.","[4] (V.59:24) See the footnote of (V.7:180)."
