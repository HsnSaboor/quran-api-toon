  29,24,"So nothing was the answer of [Ibrâhîm’s (Abraham)] people except that they said: ""Kill him or burn him."" Then Allâh saved him from the fire. Verily, in this are indeed signs for a people who believe.<sup>4</sup>","[4] (V.29:24) See the footnote of (V.3:173)."
  29,25,"And [Ibrâhîm (Abraham)] said: ""You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allâh. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.""",""
  29,26,"So Lût (Lot) believed in him [Ibrâhîm’s (Abraham) Message of Islâmic Monotheism]. He [Ibrâhîm (Abraham)] said: ""I will emigrate for the sake of my Lord. Verily, He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.<sup>5</sup>""","[5] (V.29:26) See the footnote of (V.9:121)."
  29,27,"And We bestowed on him [Ibrâhîm (Abraham)], Ishâq (Isaac) and Ya‘qûb (Jacob), and We ordained among his offspring Prophethood and the Book [i.e. the Taurât (Torah) (to Mûsâ - Moses), the Injeel (Gospel) (to ‘Îsâ - Jesus), and the Qur’ân (to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), all from the offspring of Ibrâhîm (Abraham)], and We granted him his reward in this world; and verily, in the Hereafter he is indeed among the righteous.",""
  29,28,"And (remember) Lût (Lot), when he said to his people: ""You commit Al-Fâhishah (sodomy - the worst sin) which none has preceded you in (committing) it in the ‘Âlamîn (mankind and jinn).""",""
  29,29,"""Verily, you practise sodomy with men, and rob the wayfarer (travellers)! And practise Al-Munkar (disbelief and polytheism and every kind of evil wicked deed) in your meetings."" But his people gave no answer except that they said: ""Bring Allâh’s Torment upon us if you are one of the truthful.""",""
  29,30,"He said: ""My Lord! Give me victory over the people who are Mufsidûn (those who commit great crimes and sins, oppressors, tyrants, mischief-makers, corrupters).",""
