quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  41,21,"And they will say to their skins, ""Why do you testify against us?"" They will say: ""Allâh has caused us to speak as He causes all things to speak: and He created you the first time, and to Him you are made to return.""",""
  41,22,"And you have not been hiding yourselves (in the world), lest your ears, and your eyes, and your skins should testify against you; but you thought that Allâh knew not much of what you were doing.",""
  41,23,"And that thought of yours which you thought about your Lord, has brought you to destruction; and you have become (this Day) of those utterly lost!",""
  41,24,"Then, if they bear the torment patiently, then the Fire is the home for them, and if they seek to please Allâh, yet they are not of those who will ever be allowed to please Allâh.",""
  41,25,"And We have assigned for them (devils) intimate companions (in this world), who have made fair-seeming to them, what was before them (evil deeds which they were doing in the present worldly life and disbelief in the Reckoning and the Resurrection) and what was behind them (denial of the matters in the coming life of the Hereafter as regards punishment or reward). And the Word (i.e. the torment) is justified against them as it was justified against those who were among the previous generations of jinn and men that had passed away before them. Indeed they (all) were the losers.",""
  41,26,"And those who disbelieve say: ""Listen not to this Qur’ân, and make noise in the midst of its (recitation) that you may overcome.""",""
  41,27,"But surely, We shall cause those who disbelieve to taste a severe torment, and certainly, We shall requite them the worst of what they used to do.",""
  41,28,"That is the recompense of the enemies of Allâh: the Fire. Therein will be for them the eternal home, a (deserving) recompense for that they used to deny Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.).",""
  41,29,"And those who disbelieve will say: ""Our Lord! Show us those among jinn and men who led us astray: that we may crush them under our feet so that they become the lowest.""",""
