  3,71,"O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): ""Why do you mix truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know?""<sup>14</sup>","[14] (V.3:71) Narrated Anas رضي الله عنه : There was a christian who embraced Islâm and read Sûrat-Al-Baqara and Al-‘Imrân, and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. Later on he reverted to Christianity again, and he used to say: ""Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم knows nothing but what I have written for him."" Then Allâh caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, ""This is the act of Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body out because he had run away from them."" They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, ""This is an act of Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body outside it, for he had run away from them."" They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground). (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No.814)."
  3,72,"And a party of the people of the Scripture say: ""Believe in the morning in that which is revealed to the believers (Muslims), and reject it at the end of the day, so that they may turn back.",""
  3,73,"And believe no one except the one who follows your religion. Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""Verily! Right guidance is the Guidance of Allâh"" and do not believe that anyone can receive like that which you have received, otherwise they would engage you in argument before your Lord. Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""All the bounty is in the Hand<sup>15</sup> of Allâh; He grants to whom He wills. And Allâh is All-Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All-Knower.""","[15] (V.3:73) ""The Qualities of Allâh عز وجل ""\nصفات الله عز وجل\nإن جميع ما ورد في كتاب الله عز وجل من صفات الله تعالى كالوجه والعين واليد والساق والمجيء، والاستواء وغيرها من الصفات ، أو مما وصفه الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم وثبت في الأحاديث النبوية الصحيحة كالنزول ، والضحك ، وغيرها فإن العلماء بالكتاب والسنة يؤمنون بهذه الصفات ، ويثبتونها لله تعالى من غير تأويل أو تشبيه أو تعطيل ، وهي صفات تليق بالله تعالى لا تشبه صفات أحد من المخلوقين لقوله تعالى (لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ) 42/11 وقوله تعالى (وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُواً أَحَدُ) 112/4 .\nSifât-ullâh (Qualities of Allâh).\nAll that has been revealed in Allâh’s Book [the Qur’ân] as regards the [Sifâf ] Qualities of Allâh عز وجل , the Most High, like His Face, Eyes, Hands, Shins, (Legs), His Coming, His (Istawa ) rising over His Throne and others, or all that Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم qualified Him in the true authentic Prophet’s Ahadith (narrations) as regards His Qualities like [Nuzûl ], His Descent or His laughing and others, the religious scholars of the Qur’ân and the Sunnah believe in these Qualities of Allâh and they confirm that these are really His Qualities, without Ta’wîl (interpreting their meanings into different things) or Tashbîh"" (giving resemblance or similarity to any of the creatures) or [Ta‘tîl ] (completely ignoring or denying them i.e., there is no Face, or Eyes or Hands, or Shins for Allâh). These Qualities befit or suit only for Allâh Alone, and He does not resemble any of (His) creatures. As Allâh’s Statement (in the Qur’ân): (1) ""There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, The All-Seer"" (V.42.11) There is none comparable unto him (V.112:4)."""
  3,74,"He selects for His Mercy (Islâm and the Qur’ân with Prophethood) whom He wills and Allâh is the Owner of Great Bounty.",""
  3,75,"Among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is he who, if entrusted with a Qintâr (a great amount of wealth, etc.), will readily pay it back; and among them there is he who, if entrusted with a single silver coin, will not repay it unless you constantly stand demanding, because they say: ""There is no blame on us to betray and take the properties of the illiterates (Arabs)."" But they tell a lie against Allâh while they know it.",""
  3,76,"Yes, whoever fulfils his pledge and fears Allâh much; verily, then Allâh loves those who are Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2).",""
  3,77,"Verily, those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allâh’s Covenant and their oaths, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter (Paradise). Neither will Allâh speak to them, nor look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful torment.",""
