  3,110,"You [true believers in Islâmic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his Sunnah] are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm has ordained) and forbid Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islâm has forbidden), and you believe in Allâh<sup>21</sup>. And had the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) believed, it would have been better for them; among them are some who have faith, but most of them are Al-Fâsiqûn (disobedient to Allâh - and rebellious against Allâh’s Command).","[21] (V.3:110) a) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه The Verse:\n""You [true believers in Islâmic Monotheism and real followers of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and his Sunnah], are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind"" means, the best of the people for the people, as you bring them with chains on their necks till they embrace Islâm (and thereby save them from the eternal punishment in the Hell-fire and make them enter Paradise in the Hereafter). (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.6, Hadîth No.80).\nb) CHAPTER 144. The prisoners of war in chains.\nNarrated Abû Hurairah رضي الله عنه : The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, ""Allâh wonders at those people who will enter Paradise in chains."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No. 254).*\n* The people referred to here may be the prisoners of war who were captured and chained by the Muslims and their imprisonment was the cause of their conversion to Islâm. So, it is as if their chains were the means of winning Paradise."

  3,112,"Indignity is put over them wherever they may be, except when under a covenant (of protection) from Allâh, and from men; they have drawn on themselves the Wrath of Allâh, and destruction is put over them. This is because they disbelieved in the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh and killed the Prophets without right. This is because they disobeyed (Allâh) and used to transgress beyond bounds (in Allâh’s disobedience, crimes and sins).",""
  3,113,"Not all of them are alike; a party of the people of the Scripture stand for the right, they recite the Verses of Allâh during the hours of the night, prostrating themselves in prayer.",""
  3,114,"They believe in Allâh and the Last Day; they enjoin Al-Ma‘rûf (Islâmic Monotheism, and following Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and forbid Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and opposing Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم); and they hasten in (all) good works; and they are among the righteous.",""
  3,115,"And whatever good they do, nothing will be rejected of them; for Allâh knows well those who are Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2).",""
