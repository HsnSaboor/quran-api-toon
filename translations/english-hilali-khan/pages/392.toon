  28,52,"Those to whom We gave the Scripture [i.e. the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] before it, they believe in it (the Qur’ân).",""
  28,53,"And when it is recited to them, they say: ""We believe in it. Verily, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed even before it we have been from those who submit themselves to Allâh in Islâm as Muslims (like ‘Abdullâh bin Salâm and Salmân Al-Farisî).<sup>1</sup>","[1] (V.28:53): See the footnote of (V.5:66)."
  28,54,"These will be given their reward twice over,<sup>2</sup> because they are patient, and repel evil with good, and spend (in charity) out of what We have provided them.","[2] (V.28:54)\na) Narrated Abû Burdah’s father: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Any man who has a slave-girl whom he educates properly, teaches good manners, manumits and marries her, will get a double reward. And if any man of the people of the Scriptures (Jews and Christians) believes in his own Prophet and then believes in me (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) too, he will (also) get a double reward. And any slave who fulfils his duty to his master and to his Lord (Allah), will (also) get a double reward."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.7, Hadîth No.20).\nb) See the footnote of (V.3:85)."
  28,55,"And when they hear Al-Laghw (dirty, false, evil vain talk), they withdraw from it and say: ""To us our deeds, and to you your deeds. Peace be to you. We seek not (the way of) the ignorant.""",""
  28,56,"Verily you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) guide not whom you like, but Allâh guides whom He wills. And He knows best those who are the guided.<sup>3</sup>","[3] (V.28:56) Narrated Al-Musayyab: When Abû Tâlib was on his death bed, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم went to him while Abû Jahl was sitting beside him. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""O my uncle! Say: Lâ ilâha illallâh (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah), an expression with which I will defend your case, before Allah."" Abû Jahl and ‘Abdullâh bin Umayyah said: ""O Abû Tâlib! Will you leave the religion of ‘Abdul Muttalib?"" So they kept on saying this to him so that the last statement he said to them (before he died) was: ""I am on the religion of ‘Abdul Muttalib."" Then the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""I will keep on asking for Allah’s Forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden to do so."" Then the following Verse was revealed: ""It is not proper for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah’s Forgiveness for the Mushrikûn even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire (because they died in a state of disbelief)."" (V.9:113).\nThe other Verse was also revealed: ""Verily, you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) guide not whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills."" (V.28:56). (Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol.5, Hadîth No.223)."
  28,57,"And they say: ""If we follow the guidance with you, we would be snatched away from our land."" Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary (Makkah), to which are brought fruits of all kinds, a provision from Ourselves, but most of them know not.<sup>4</sup>","[4] (V.28:57)\na) Narrated Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما: On the day of the conquest of Makkah, Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""Allâh has made this town a sanctuary. Its thorny bushes should not be cut, its game should not be chased, and its fallen things should not be picked up except by one who would announce them publicly."" (Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol.2, Hadîth No.657).\nb) See the footnote of (V.2:191)."
  28,58,"And how many a town (population) have We destroyed, which was thankless for its means of livelihood (disobeyed Allâh, and His Messengers, by doing evil deeds and crimes)! And those are their dwellings, which have not been inhabited after them except a little. And verily! We have been the inheritors.",""
  28,59,"And never will your Lord destroy the towns (populations) until He sends to their mother town a Messenger reciting to them Our Verses. And never would We destroy the towns unless the people thereof are Zâlimûn (polytheists, wrong-doers, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh, oppressors and tyrants).",""
