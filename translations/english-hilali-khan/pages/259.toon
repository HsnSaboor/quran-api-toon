  14,25,"Giving its fruit at all times, by the Leave of its Lord, and Allâh sets forth parables for mankind in order that they may remember.",""
  14,26,"And the parable of an evil word is that of an evil tree uprooted from the surface of earth, having no stability.",""
  14,27,"Allâh will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world (i.e. they will keep on worshipping Allâh Alone and none else), and in the Hereafter.<sup>3</sup> And Allâh will cause to go astray those who are Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers), and Allâh does what He wills.<sup>4</sup>","[3] (V.14:27) i.e. immediately after their death (in their graves, etc.), when the angels (Munkar and Nakîr ) will ask them three questions: As to: (1) Who is your Lord? (2) What is your religion? and (3) What do you say about this man (Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) who was sent to you? The believers will give the correct answers, i.e. (1) My Lord is Allâh; (2) My religion is Islâm; and (3) This man Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is Allâh’s Messenger, and he came to us with clear signs and we believed in him, - while the wrong-doers who believed not in the Message of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم will not be able to answer these questions. [See Tafsir Ibn Kathir].\n[4] (V.14:27) See the footnotes of (V.3:85) and (V.6:93)."

  14,30,"And they set up rivals to Allâh, to mislead (men) from His Path! Say: ""Enjoy (your brief life)! But certainly, your destination is the (Hell) Fire!""",""
  14,31,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to ‘Ibâdî (My slaves) who have believed, that they should perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât ), and spend in charity out of the sustenance We have given them, secretly and openly, before the coming of a Day on which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending.",""
  14,32,"Allâh is He Who has created the heavens and the earth and sends down water (rain) from the sky, and thereby brought forth fruits as provision for you; and He has made the ships to be of service to you, that they may sail through the sea by His Command; and He has made rivers (also) to be of service to you.",""
