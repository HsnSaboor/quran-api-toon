quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  10,26,"For those who have done good is the best (reward, i.e. Paradise) and even more (i.e. having the honour of glancing at the Countenance of Allâh جل جلاله). Neither darkness nor dust nor any humiliating disgrace shall cover their faces. They are the dwellers of Paradise, they will abide therein forever.",""
  10,27,"And those who have earned evil deeds, the recompense of an evil deed is the like thereof, and humiliating disgrace will cover them (their faces). No defender will they have from Allâh. Their faces will be covered as it were with pieces from the darkness of night. They are the dwellers of the Fire, they will abide therein forever.",""
  10,28,"And the Day whereon We shall gather them all together, then We shall say to those who did set partners in worship with Us: ""Stop at your place! You and your partners (whom you had worshipped in the worldly life)."" then We shall separate them, and their (Allâh’s so-called) partners shall say: ""It was not us that you used to worship.""",""
  10,29,"""So sufficient is Allâh as a witness between us and you that we indeed knew nothing of your worship of us.""",""
  10,30,"There! Every person will know (exactly) what he had earned before and they will be brought back to Allâh, their rightful Maulâ (Lord), and their invented false deities will vanish from them.",""
  10,31,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""Who provides for you from the sky and the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs?"" They will say: ""Allâh."" Say: ""Will you not then be afraid of Allâh’s punishment (for setting up rivals in worship with Allâh)?""",""
  10,32,"Such is Allâh, your Lord in truth. So after the truth, what else can there be, save error? How then are you turned away?",""
  10,33,"Thus is the Word of your Lord justified against those who rebel (disobey Allâh) that they will not believe (in the Oneness of Allâh and in Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم as the Messenger of Allâh).",""
