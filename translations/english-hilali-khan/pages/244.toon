quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  12,70,"So when he had furnished them forth with their provisions, he put the (golden) bowl in his brother’s bag. Then a crier cried: ""O you (in) the caravan! Surely, you are thieves!""",""
  12,71,"They, turning towards them, said: ""What is it that you have lost?""",""
  12,72,"They said: ""We have lost the (golden) bowl of the king and for him who produces it is (the reward of) a camel load; and I will be bound by it.""",""
  12,73,"They said: ""By Allâh! Indeed you know that we came not to make mischief in the land, and we are no thieves!""",""
  12,74,"They [Yûsuf’s (Joseph) men] said: ""What then shall be the penalty of him, if you are (proved to be) liars.""",""
  12,75,"They [Yûsuf’s (Joseph) brothers] said: ""His penalty should be that he, in whose bag it is found, should be held for the punishment (of the crime). Thus we punish the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers)!""",""
  12,76,"So he [Yûsuf (Joseph)] began (the search) in their bags before the bag of his brother. Then he brought it out of his brother’s bag. Thus did We plan for Yûsuf (Joseph). He could not take his brother by the law of the king (as a slave), except that Allâh willed it. (So Allâh made the brothers to bind themselves with their way of ""punishment, i.e. enslaving of a thief."") We raise to degrees whom We will, but over all those endowed with knowledge is the All-Knowing (Allâh).",""
  12,77,"They [(Yûsuf’s (Joseph) brothers] said: ""If he steals, there was a brother of his [Yûsuf (Joseph)] who did steal before (him)."" But these things did Yûsuf (Joseph) keep in himself, revealing not the secrets to them. He said (within himself): ""You are in worst case, and Allâh is the Best Knower of that which you describe!""",""
  12,78,"They said: ""O ruler of the land! Verily, he has an old father (who will grieve for him); so take one of us in his place. Indeed we think that you are one of the Muhsinûn (good-doers - see the footnote of V.9:120).""",""
