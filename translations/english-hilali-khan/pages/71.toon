  3,161,"It is not for any Prophet to take illegally a part of booty (Ghulul ),<sup>31</sup> and whosoever deceives his companions as regards the booty, he shall bring forth on the Day of Resurrection that which he took (illegally). Then every person shall be paid in full what he has earned, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.","[31] (V.3:161) Al-Ghulul: (Stealing from the war booty before its distribution), and the Statement of Allâh تعالى: ""And whosoever deceives his companions as regards booty, he shall bring forth on the Day of Resurrection that which he took (illegally)"".\nNarrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم got up amongst us and mentioned Al-Ghulul, emphasised its magnitude and declared that it was a great sin saying, ""Don’t commit Al-Ghulul for I should not like to see anyone amongst you on the Day of Resurrection, carrying over his neck a sheep that will be bleating, or carrying over his neck a horse that will be neighing. Such a man will be saying: ‘O Allâh’s Messenger! Intercede with Allâh for me,’ and I will reply, ‘I can’t help you, for I have conveyed Allâh’s Message to you.’ Nor should I like to see a man carrying over his neck, a camel that will be grunting. Such a man will say, ‘O Allâh’s Messenger! Intercede with Allâh for me,’ and I will say, ‘I can’t help you for I have conveyed Allâh’s Message to you’; or one carrying over his neck gold and silver and saying, ‘O Allâh’s Messenger! Intercede with Allâh for me.’ And I will say, ‘I can’t help you, for I have conveyed Allâh’s Message to you, or one carrying clothes that will be fluttering, and the man will say, ‘O Allâh’s Messenger!

  3,164,"Indeed Allâh conferred a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) from among themselves, reciting unto them His Verses (the Qur’ân), and purifying them (from sins by their following him), and instructing them (in) the Book (the Qur’ân) and Al-Hikmah [the wisdom and the Sunnah of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم (i.e. his legal ways, statements, acts of worship)], while before that they had been in manifest error.<sup>32</sup>","[32] (V.3:164) Following the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم.

Ibn ‘Aun said, ""(There are) three things which I love for myself and for my brothers, i.e. this Sunnah (the legal ways of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم) which they should learn and ask about; the Qur’ân which they should understand and ask the people about; and that they should leave the people except when intending to do good (for them).""

Some of them said, ""He is sleeping."" Others said, His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake."" Then they said, ""There is an example for this companion of yours."" One of them said, ""Then set forth an example for him."" Some of them said, ""He is sleeping."" The others said, ""His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake."" Then they said, ""His example is that of a man who has built a house and then, offered therein a banquet and sent an inviter (messenger) to invite the people. So whosoever accepted the invitation of the inviter, entered the house and ate of the banquet, and whoever did not accept the invitation of the inviter, did not enter the house, nor did he eat of the banquet."" Then the angels said, ""Interpret this parable to him so that he may understand it."" Some of them said, ""He is sleeping."" The others said, ""His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake."" And then they said, ""The house stands for Paradise and the call-maker is Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and whoever obeys Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم , obeys Allâh; and whoever disobeys Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, disobeys Allâh. Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم separated the people (i.e., through his message, the good is distinguished from the bad, and the believers from the disbelievers).""

So this is the example of that person who obeys me and follows that truth which I have brought (the Qur’ân and the Sunnah), and the example of the one who disobeys me and disbelieves the truth I have brought.""
