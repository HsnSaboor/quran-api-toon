quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  42,11,"The Creator of the heavens and the earth. He has made for you mates from yourselves, and for the cattle (also) mates. By this means He creates you (in the wombs). There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.",""
  42,12,"To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. He enlarges provision for whom He wills, and straitens (it for whom He wills). Verily He is the All-Knower of everything.",""
  42,13,"He (Allâh) has ordained for you the same religion (Islâmic Monotheism) which He ordained for Nûh (Noah), and that which We have revealed to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم), and that which We ordained for Ibrâhîm (Abraham), Mûsâ (Moses) and ‘Îsâ (Jesus) saying you should establish religion (i.e. to do what it orders you to do practically), and make no divisions<sup>3</sup> in it (religion) (i.e. various sects in religion). Intolerable for the Mushrikûn,<sup>4</sup> is that (Islamic Monotheism) to which you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) call them. Allâh chooses for Himself whom He wills, and guides unto Himself who turns to Him in repentance and in obedience.","[3] (V.42:13) See the footnote of (V.3:103).\n[4] (V.42:13) Mushrikun: Polytheists, pagans, idolaters, and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah, those who worship others along with Allah or set up rivals or partners to Allah."
  42,14,"And they divided not till after knowledge had come to them, through (selfish) transgression between themselves. And had it not been for a Word that went forth before from your Lord for an appointed term, the matter would have been settled between them. And verily, those who were made to inherit the Scripture [i.e. the Taurâh (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] after them (i.e. Jews and Christians) are in grave doubt concerning it (i.e. Allâh’s true religion - Islâm or the Qur’ân).",""
  42,15,"So unto this (religion of Islâm alone and this Qur’ân) then invite (people) (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم), and stand firm [on Islâmic Monotheism by performing all that is ordained by Allâh (good deeds), and by abstaining from all that is forbidden by Allâh (sins and evil deeds)], as you are commanded, and follow not their desires but say: ""I believe in whatsoever Allâh has sent down of the Book [all the holy Books, - this Qur’ân and the Books of the old from the Taurât (Torah), or the Injeel (Gospel) or the Pages of Ibrâhîm (Abraham)] and I am commanded to do justice among you. Allâh is our Lord and your Lord. For us our deeds and for you your deeds. There is no dispute between us and you. Allâh will assemble us (all), and to Him is the final return.""",""
