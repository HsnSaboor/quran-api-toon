quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,160,"And We divided them into twelve tribes (as distinct) nations. We revealed to Mûsâ (Moses) when his people asked him for water (saying): ""Strike the stone with your stick"", and there gushed forth out of it twelve springs, each group knew its own place for water. We shaded them with the clouds and sent down upon them Al-Manna <sup>11</sup> and the quails (saying): ""Eat of the good things with which We have provided you."" They harmed Us not but they used to harm themselves.","[11] (V.7:160) See the footnote of (V.2:57)"
  7,161,"And (remember) when it was said to them: ""Dwell in this town (Jerusalem) and eat therefrom wherever you wish, and say, ‘(O Allâh) forgive our sins’; and enter the gate prostrate (bowing with humility). We shall forgive you your wrong-doings. We shall increase (the reward) for the good-doers.""",""
  7,162,"But those among them who did wrong changed the word that had been told to them. So We sent on them a torment from the heaven in return for their wrong-doings.<sup>12</sup>","[12] (V.7:162): See (V.2:59) and its footnote."
  7,163,"And ask them (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) about the town that was by the sea; when they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday): when their fish came to them openly on the Sabbath day, and did not come to them on the day they had no Sabbath. Thus We made a trial of them, for they used to rebel against Allâh’s Command (disobey Allâh) [see the Qur’ân: V.4:154 and its footnote].",""
