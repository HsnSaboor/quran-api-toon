  6,36,"It is only those who listen (to the Message of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), will respond (benefit from it), but as for the dead (i.e. disbelievers), Allâh will raise them up, then to Him they will be returned (for their recompense).",""
  6,37,"And they said: ""Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?"" Say: ""Allâh is certainly Able to send down a sign, but most of them know not.""",""
  6,38,"There is not a moving (living) creature on earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered.",""
  6,39,"Those who reject Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) are deaf and dumb in the darkness. Allâh sends astray whom He wills and He guides on the Straight Path whom He wills.",""
  6,40,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""Tell me if Allâh’s Torment comes upon you, or the Hour comes upon you, would you then call upon any one other than Allâh? (Reply) if you are truthful!""",""
  6,41,"Nay! To Him Alone you would call, and, if He wills, He would remove that (distress) for which you call upon Him, and you would forget at that time whatever partners you joined (with Him in worship)!",""
  6,42,"Verily, We sent (Messengers) to many nations before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم). And We seized them with extreme poverty (or loss in wealth) and loss in health (with calamities) so that they might humble themselves (believe with humility).",""
  6,43,"When Our Torment reached them, why then did they not humble themselves (believe with humility)? But their hearts became hardened, and Shaitân (Satan) made fair-seeming to them that which they used to do.",""
  6,44,"So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened for them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them (in punishment), and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.",""
