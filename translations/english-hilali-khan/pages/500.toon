  45,14,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the believers to forgive those who (harm them and) hope not for the Days of Allâh (i.e. His Recompense), that He may recompense people, according to what they have earned (i.e. to punish these disbelievers who harm the believers).<sup>1</sup>","[1] (V.45:14) The provision of this Verse was abrogated by the Verse of Jihâd (holy fighting) (V.9:36) against the polytheists."
  45,15,"Whosoever does a good deed, it is for his ownself, and whosoever does evil, it is against (his ownself). Then to your Lord you will be made to return.",""
  45,16,"And indeed We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture, and the understanding of the Scripture and its laws, and the Prophethood; and provided them with good things, and preferred them above the ‘Âlamîn (mankind and jinn of their time, during that period),",""
  45,17,"And gave them clear proofs in matters [by revealing to them the Taurât (Torah)]. And they differed not until after the knowledge came to them, through envy among themselves. Verily, Your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they used to differ.",""
  45,18,"Then We have put you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) on a (plain) way of (Our) commandment [like the one which We commanded Our Messengers before you (i.e. legal ways and laws of the Islâmic Monotheism)]. So follow you that (Islâmic Monotheism and its laws), and follow not the desires of those who know not. (Tafsir At-Tabarî).",""
  45,19,"Verily, they can avail you nothing against Allâh (if He wants to punish you). Verily, the Zâlimûn (polytheists, wrong-doers) are Auliyâ’ (protectors, helpers) of one another, but Allâh is the Walî (Helper, Protector) of the Muttaqûn (the pious. See V.2:2).",""
