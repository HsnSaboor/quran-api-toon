quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  40,34,"And indeed Yûsuf (Joseph) did come to you, in times gone by, with clear signs, but you ceased not to doubt in that which he did bring to you: till when he died you said: ""No Messenger will Allâh send after him."" Thus Allâh leaves astray him who is a Musrif (a polytheist, an oppressor, a criminal, sinner who commit great sins) and a Murtâb (one who doubts Allâh’s Warning and His Oneness).",""
  40,35,"Those who dispute about the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh, without any authority that has come to them, it is greatly hateful and disgusting to Allâh and to those who believe. Thus does Allâh seal up the heart of every arrogant, tyrant. (So they cannot guide themselves to the Right Path).",""
  40,36,"And Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) said: ""O Hâmân! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways -",""
  40,37,"""The ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the Ilâh (God) of Mûsâ (Moses): But verily, I think him to be a liar."" Thus it was made fair-seeming, in Fir‘aun’s (Pharaoh) eyes, the evil of his deeds, and he was hindered from the (Right) Path; and the plot of Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) led to nothing but loss and destruction (for him).",""
  40,38,"And the man who believed said: ""O my people! Follow me, I will guide you to the way of right conduct [i.e. guide you to Allâh’s religion of Islâmic Monotheism with which Mûsâ (Moses) has been sent].",""
  40,39,"""O my people! Truly, this life of the world is nothing but a (quick passing) enjoyment, and verily, the Hereafter that is the home that will remain forever.""",""
  40,40,"""Whosoever does an evil deed, will not be requited except the like thereof; and whosoever does a righteous deed, whether male or female and is a true believer (in the Oneness of Allâh), such will enter Paradise, where they will be provided therein (with all things in abundance) without limit.",""
