  28,14,"And when he attained his full strength, and was perfect (in manhood), We bestowed on him Hukm (Prophethood and right judgement of the affairs) and religious knowledge [of the religion of his forefathers i.e. Islâmic Monotheism]. And thus do We reward the Muhsinûn (i.e. good doers. See the footnote of V.9:120).",""
  28,15,"And he entered the city at a time of unawareness of its people: and he found there two men fighting, - one of his party (his religion - from the Children of Israel), and the other of his foes. The man of his (own) party asked him for help against his foe, so Mûsâ (Moses) struck him with his fist and killed him. He said: ""This is of Shaitan’s (Satan) doing: verily, he is a plain misleading enemy.""",""
  28,16,"He said: ""My Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself, so forgive me."" Then He forgave him. Verily, He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.",""
  28,17,"He said: ""My Lord! For that with which You have favoured me, I will never more be a helper of the Mujrimûn (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners)!""",""
  28,18,"So he became afraid, looking about in the city (waiting as to what will be the result of his crime of killing), when behold, the man who had sought his help the day before, called for his help (again). Mûsâ (Moses) said to him: ""Verily, you are a plain misleader!""",""
  28,19,"Then when he decided to seize the man who was an enemy to both of them, the man said: ""O Mûsâ (Moses)! Is it your intention to kill me as you killed a man yesterday? Your aim is nothing but to become a tyrant in the land, and not to be one of those who do right.""",""
  28,20,"And there came a man running, from the farthest end of the city. He said: ""O Mûsâ (Moses)! Verily, the chiefs are taking counsel together about you, to kill you, so escape. Truly, I am one of the good advisers to you.""",""
  28,21,"So he escaped from there, looking about in a state of fear. He said: ""My Lord! Save me from the people who are Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers)!""",""
