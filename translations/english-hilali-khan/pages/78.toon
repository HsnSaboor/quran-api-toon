quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,7,"There is a share for men and a share for women from what is left by parents and those nearest related, whether the property be small or large - a legal share.",""
  4,8,"And when the relatives and the orphans and Al-Masâkîn (the poor) are present at the time of division, give them out of the property, and speak to them words of kindness and justice.",""
  4,9,"And let those (executors and guardians) have the same fear in their minds as they would have for their own, if they had left weak offspring behind. So let them fear Allâh and speak right words.",""
  4,10,"Verily, those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans, they eat up only fire into their bellies, and they will be burnt in the blazing Fire!",""
  4,11,"Allâh commands you as regards your children’s (inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females; if (there are) only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers (or sisters), the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts. You know not which of them, whether your parents or your children, are nearest to you in benefit; (these fixed shares) are ordained by Allâh. And Allâh is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.",""
