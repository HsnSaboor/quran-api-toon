  10,15,"And when Our clear Verses are recited unto them, those who hope not for their meeting with Us, say: ""Bring us a Qur’ân other than this, or change it."" Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""It is not for me to change it on my own accord; I only follow that which is revealed unto me. Verily, I fear the torment of the Great Day (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) if I were to disobey my Lord.""",""
  10,16,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""If Allâh had so willed, I should not have recited it to you nor would He have made it known to you. Verily, I have stayed amongst you a life time before this. Have you then no sense?""",""
  10,17,"So who does more wrong than he who forges a lie against Allâh or denies His Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.)? Surely, the Mujrimûn (criminals, sinners, disbelievers and polytheists) will never be successful!",""
  10,18,"And they worship besides Allâh things that harm them not, nor profit them, and they say: ""These are our intercessors with Allâh."" Say: ""Do you inform Allâh of that which He knows not in the heavens and on the earth?"" Glorified and Exalted is He above all that which they associate as partners (with Him)!",""
  10,19,"Mankind were but one community (i.e. on one religion - Islâmic Monotheism), then they differed (later); and had not it been for a Word that went forth before from your Lord, it would have been settled between them regarding what they differed<sup>5</sup>.","[5] (V.10:19) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Every child is born on Al-Fitrah [true faith of Islâmic Monotheism (i.e. to worship none but Allâh Alone)], but his parents convert him to Judaism or Christianity or Magianism, as an animal gives birth to a perfect baby animal. Do you find it mutilated?"" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.2, Hadith No.467). [See also the Qur’ân, Verse 30:30]"
  10,20,"And they say: ""How is it that not a sign is sent down on him from his Lord?"" Say: ""The Unseen belongs to Allâh Alone, so wait you, verily, I am with you among those who wait (for Allâh’s Judgement).""",""
