  6,152,"""And come not near to the orphan’s property, except to improve it, until he (or she) attains the age of full strength; and give full measure and full weight with justice. We burden not any person, but that which he can bear. And whenever you give your word (i.e. judge between men or give evidence), say the truth even if a near relative is concerned, and fulfil the Covenant of Allâh. This He commands you, that you may remember<sup>19</sup>.","[19] (V.6:152):\nA) See the footnotes of (V.3:130).\nB) See the footnote of (V.4:135)."
  6,153,"""And verily, this (i.e. Allâh’s Commandments mentioned in the above two Verses 151 and 152) is My Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - see V.2:2).""",""
  6,154,"Then, We gave Mûsâ (Moses) the Book [the Taurât (Torah)] to complete (Our Favour) upon those who would do right, and explaining all things in detail and a guidance and a mercy that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord.",""
  6,155,"And this is a blessed Book (the Qur’ân) which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allâh (i.e. do not disobey His Orders), that you may receive mercy (i.e. be saved from the torment of Hell).",""
  6,156,"Lest you (pagan Arabs) should say: ""The Book was sent down only to two sects before us (the Jews and the Christians), and for our part, we were in fact unaware of what they studied.""",""
  6,157,"Or lest you (pagan Arabs) should say: ""If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely have been better guided than they (Jews and Christians)."" So now has come unto you a clear proof (the Qur’ân) from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy. Who then does more wrong than one who rejects the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh and turns away therefrom? We shall requite those who turn away from Our Ayât with an evil torment, because of their turning away (from them). [Tafsir At-Tabari]",""
