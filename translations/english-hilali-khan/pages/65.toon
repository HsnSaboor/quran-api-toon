  3,116,"Surely, those who reject Faith (disbelieve in Allâh and in Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as being Allâh’s Messenger and in all that which he صلى الله عليه وسلم has brought from Allâh), neither their properties, nor their offspring will avail them aught against Allâh. They are the dwellers of the Fire, therein they will abide. (Tafsir At-Tabarî).",""
  3,117,"The likeness of what they spend in this world is the likeness of a wind which is extremely cold; it struck the harvest of a people who did wrong against themselves and destroyed it, (i.e. the good deed of a person is only accepted if he is a monotheist and believes in all the Prophets of Allâh, including the Christ عليه السلام and Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم). Allâh wronged them not, but they wronged themselves.",""
  3,118,"O you who believe! Take not as (your) Bitânah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed We have made plain to you the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses) if you understand.",""
  3,119,"Lo! You are the ones who love them but they love you not, and you believe in all the Scriptures [i.e. you believe in the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), while they disbelieve in your Book, the Qur’ân]. And when they meet you, they say, ""We believe."" But when they are alone, they bite the tips of their fingers at you in rage. Say: ""Perish in your rage. Certainly, Allâh knows what is in the breasts (all the secrets).""",""
  3,120,"If a good befalls you, it grieves them, but if some evil overtakes you, they rejoice at it. But if you remain patient and become Al-Muttaqûn [the pious - See V.2:2], not the least harm will their cunning do to you. Surely, Allâh surrounds all that they do.",""
  3,121,"And (remember) when you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) left your household in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle (of Uhud). And Allâh is All-Hearer, All-Knower.",""
