  4,148,"Allâh does not like that the evil should be uttered in public except by him who has been wronged. And Allâh is Ever All-Hearer, All-Knower.",""
  4,149,"Whether you (mankind) disclose (by good words of thanks) a good deed (done to you in the form of a favour by someone), or conceal it, or pardon an evil, ... verily, Allâh is Ever Oft-Pardoning, All-Powerful.",""
  4,150,"Verily, those who disbelieve in Allâh and His Messengers and wish to make distinction between Allâh and His Messengers (by believing in Allâh and disbelieving in His Messengers) saying, ""We believe in some but reject others,"" and wish to adopt a way in between.",""
  4,151,"They are in truth disbelievers. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating torment.",""
  4,152,"And those who believe in Allâh and His Messengers and make no distinction between any of them (Messengers), We shall give them their rewards; and Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  4,153,"The people of the Scripture (Jews) ask you to cause a book to descend upon them from heaven. Indeed they asked Mûsâ (Moses) for even greater than that, when they said: ""Show us Allâh in public,"" but they were struck with thunderclap and lightning for their wickedness. Then they worshipped the calf even after clear proofs, evidence, and signs had come to them. (Even) so We forgave them. And We gave Mûsâ (Moses) a clear proof of authority.",""
  4,154,"And for their covenant, We raised over them the Mount and (on the other occasion) We said: ""Enter the gate prostrating (or bowing) with humility;"" and We commanded them: ""Transgress not (by doing worldly works) on the Sabbath (Saturday)."" And We took from them a firm covenant<sup>41</sup>.","[41] (V.4:154) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""It was said to Banî Israel, ‘Enter the gate (of the town) bowing with humility (prostrating yourselves) and say: ‘Repentance’, but they changed the word and entered the town crawling on their buttocks and said: ‘A wheat grain in the hair’*."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No. 615).\n*They said so just to ridicule Allâh’s Order as they were disobedient to Him. So Allâh punished them severely by sending on them punishment, most probably in the form of (an epidemic of) plague (See Tafsir At-Tabari )."
