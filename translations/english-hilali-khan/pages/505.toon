quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  46,21,"And remember (Hûd) the brother of ‘Âd, when he warned his people in Al-Ahqâf (the curved sand-hills in the southern part of Arabian Peninsula). And surely, there have passed away warners before him and after him (saying): ""Worship none but Allâh; truly, I fear for you the torment of a mighty Day (i.e. the Day of Resurrection).""",""
  46,22,"They said: ""Have you come to turn us away from our âlihah (gods)? Then bring us that with which you threaten us, if you are one of the truthful!""",""
  46,23,"He said: ""The knowledge (of the time of its coming) is with Allâh only. And I convey to you that wherewith I have been sent, but I see that you are a people given to ignorance!""",""
  46,24,"Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud coming towards their valleys, they said: ""This is a cloud bringing us rain!"" Nay, but it is that (torment) which you were asking to be hastened - a wind wherein is a painful torment!",""
  46,25,"Destroying everything by the Command of its Lord! So they became such that nothing could be seen except their dwellings! Thus do We recompense the people who are Mujrimûn (polytheists, disbelievers, sinners)!",""
  46,26,"And indeed We had firmly established them with that wherewith We have not established you (O Quraish)! And We had assigned them the (faculties of) hearing (ears), seeing (eyes), and hearts; but their hearing (ears), seeing (eyes), and their hearts availed them nothing since they used to deny the Ayât (Allâh’s Prophets and their Prophethood, proofs, evidence, verses, signs, revelations) of Allâh, and they were completely encircled by that which they used to mock at!",""
  46,27,"And indeed We have destroyed towns (populations) round about you, and We have (repeatedly) shown (them) the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in various ways that they might return (to the truth and believe in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism).",""
  46,28,"Then why did those whom they had taken for âlihah (gods) besides Allâh, as a way of approach (to Allâh) not help them? Nay, but they vanished completely from them (when there came the torment). And that was their lie, and their inventions which they had been inventing (before their destruction).",""
