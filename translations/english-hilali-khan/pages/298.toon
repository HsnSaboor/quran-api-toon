  18,36,"""And I think not the Hour will ever come, and if indeed I am brought back to my Lord, (on the Day of Resurrection), I surely shall find better than this when I return to Him.""",""
  18,37,"His companion said to him during the talk with him: ""Do you disbelieve in Him Who created you out of dust (i.e. your father Adam), then out of Nutfah (mixed semen drops of male and female discharge), then fashioned you into a man?",""
  18,38,"""But as for my part, (I believe) that He is Allâh, my Lord, and none shall I associate as partner with my Lord.",""

A man (amongst his companions) ascended it and shouted in a loud voice. Lâ ilâha illal-lahu wallâhu Akbar* (At that time) Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم was riding his mule. Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""You are not calling upon a deaf or an absent one."" and added, ""O Abu Mûsâ (or, O ‘Abdullâh)! Shall I tell you a sentence from the treasure of Paradise?"" I said, ""Yes.""

  18,43,"And he had no group of men to help him against Allâh, nor could he defend (or save) himself.",""
  18,44,"There (on the Day of Resurrection), Al-Walâyah (protection, power, authority and kingdom) will be for Allâh (Alone), the True God. He (Allâh) is the Best for reward and the Best for the final end. (Lâ ilâha illallâh- none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh).",""
  18,45,"And put forward to them the example of the life of this world: it is like the water (rain) which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it, and becomes fresh and green.
