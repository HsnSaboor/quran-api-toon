  66,1,"O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allâh has allowed to you, seeking to please your wives? And Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  66,2,"Allâh has already ordained for you (O men) the absolution from your oaths. And Allâh is your Maulâ (Lord, or Master, or Protector) and He is the All-Knower, the All-Wise.",""
  66,3,"And (remember) when the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his wives (Hafsah), then she told it (to another i.e. ‘Âishah). And Allâh made it known to him; he informed part thereof and left a part. Then when he told her (Hafsah) thereof, she said: ""Who told you this?"" He said: ""The All-Knower, the All-Aware (Allâh) has told me.""",""
  66,4,"If you two (wives of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم : ‘Âishah and Hafsah رضي الله عنهما) turn in repentance to Allâh, (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم likes); but if you help one another against him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), then verily, Allâh is his Maulâ (Lord, or Master, or Protector), and Jibrîl (Gabriel), and the righteous among the believers; and furthermore, the angels are his helpers.",""
  66,5,"It may be if he divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you - Muslims (who submit to Allâh), believers, obedient (to Allâh), turning to Allâh in repentance, worshipping Allâh sincerely, given to fasting or emigrants (for Allâh’s sake), previously married and virgins.",""
  66,6,"O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allâh, but do that which they are commanded.",""
  66,7,"(It will be said in the Hereafter) O you who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism)! Make no excuses this Day! You are being requited only for what you used to do.<sup>1</sup>","[1] (V.66:7) See the footnote of (V.3:85)."
