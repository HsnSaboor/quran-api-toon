  31,20,"See you not (O men) that Allâh has subjected for you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and has completed and perfected His Graces upon you, (both) apparent (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism, and the lawful pleasures of this world, including health, good looks, etc.) and hidden [i.e. One’s Faith in Allâh (of Islâmic Monotheism) knowledge, wisdom, guidance for doing righteous deeds, and also the pleasures and delights of the Hereafter in Paradise]? Yet of mankind is he who disputes about Allâh without knowledge or guidance or a Book giving light!",""
  31,21,"And when it is said to them: ""Follow that which Allâh has sent down"", they say: ""Nay, we shall follow that which we found our fathers (following)."" (Would they do so) even if Shaitân (Satan) invites them to the torment of the Fire?",""
  31,22,"And whosoever submits his face (himself) to Allâh,<sup>7</sup> while he is a Muhsin (good-doer i.e. performs good deeds totally for Allâh’s sake without any show off or to gain praise or fame and does them in accordance with the Sunnah of Allâh’s Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold [Lâ ilâha illallâh (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh)]. And to Allâh return all matters for decision.","[7] (V.31:22) his face to Allâh i.e. follows Allâh’s religion of Islâmic Monotheism, worships Allâh (Alone) with sincere Faith in the (1) Oneness of His Lordship, (2) Oneness of His worship, and (3) Oneness of His Names and Qualities."
  31,23,"And whoever disbelieves, let not his disbelief grieve you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم). To Us is their return, and We shall inform them what they have done. Verily, Allâh is the All-Knower of what is in the breasts (of men).",""
  31,24,"We let them enjoy for a little while, then in the end We shall oblige them to (enter) a great torment.",""
  31,25,"And if you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) ask them: ""Who has created the heavens and the earth,"" they will certainly say: ""Allâh."" Say: ""All the praises and thanks be to Allâh!"" But most of them know not.",""
  31,26,"To Allâh belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. Verily, Allâh, He is Al-Ghanî (Rich, Free of all needs), Worthy of all praise.",""
  31,27,"And if all the trees on the earth were pens and the sea (were ink wherewith to write), with seven seas behind it to add to its (supply), yet the Words of Allâh would not be exhausted. Verily, Allâh is All-Mighty, All-Wise.",""
  31,28,"The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as (the creation and resurrection of) a single person. Verily, Allâh is All-Hearer, All-Seer.",""
