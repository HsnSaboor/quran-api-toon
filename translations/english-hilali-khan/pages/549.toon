quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  60,1,"O you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies (i.e. disbelievers and polytheists) as friends, showing affection towards them, while they have disbelieved in what has come to you of the truth (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism, this Qur’ân, and Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and have driven out the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and yourselves (from your homeland) because you believe in Allâh your Lord! If you have come forth to strive in My Cause and to seek My Good Pleasure, (then take not these disbelievers and polytheists as your friends). You show friendship to them in secret, while I am All-Aware of what you conceal and what you reveal. And whosoever of you (Muslims) does that, then indeed he has gone (far) astray from the Straight Path<sup>1</sup>.","[1] (V.60:1) See (V.3:149) and its footnote."
  60,2,"Should they gain the upper hand over you, they would behave to you as enemies, and stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you with evil, and they desire that you should disbelieve.",""
  60,3,"Neither your relatives nor your children will benefit you on the Day of Resurrection (against Allâh). He will judge between you. And Allâh is the All-Seer of what you do.",""
  60,4,"Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: ""Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allâh: we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you hostility and hatred for ever until you believe in Allâh Alone"" - except the saying of Ibrâhîm (Abraham) to his father: ""Verily, I will ask forgiveness (from Allâh) for you, but I have no power to do anything for you before Allâh.<sup>2</sup>"" Our Lord! In You (Alone) we put our trust, and to You (Alone) we turn in repentance, and to You (Alone) is (our) final Return.","[2] (V.60:4) See the Qur’ân Verses (V.9:114), (V.19:41-49) and (V.26:70-86)"
  60,5,"""Our Lord! Make us not a trial for the disbelievers, and forgive us, Our Lord! Verily, You, only You, are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.""",""
