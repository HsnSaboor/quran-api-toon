  4,141,"Those (hypocrites) who wait and watch about you; if you gain a victory from Allâh, they say: ""Were we not with you?"" But if the disbelievers gain a success, they say (to them): ""Did we not gain mastery over you and did we not protect you from the believers?"" Allâh will judge between you (all) on the Day of Resurrection. And never will Allâh grant to the disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the believers.",""
  4,142,"Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allâh, but it is He Who deceives them.<sup>39</sup> And when they stand up for As-Salât (the prayer), they stand with laziness and to be seen of men, and they do not remember Allâh but little.","[39] (V.4:142) See (V.57:12-15)."
  4,143,"(They are) swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these nor to those; and he whom Allâh sends astray, you will not find for him a way (to the truth - Islâm).",""
  4,144,"O you who believe! Take not for Auliyâ’ (protectors or helpers or friends) disbelievers instead of believers. Do you wish to offer Allâh a manifest proof against yourselves?",""
  4,145,"Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire; no helper will you find for them.<sup>40</sup>","[40] (V.4:145):\na) Narrated ‘Abdullâh bin ‘Amr رضي الله عنهما: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""Whoever has the following four (characteristics) will be a pure hypocrite and whoever has one of the following four characteristics will have one characteristic of hypocrisy unless and until he gives it up:\n1. Whenever he is entrusted, he betrays (proves dishonest).\n2. Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie.\n3. Whenever he makes a covenant, he proves treacherous.\n4. Whenever he quarrels, he behaves in a very imprudent, evil and insulting manner."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadîth No.33).\nb) See the footnote of (V.9:54).\nc) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""The worst people before Allâh on the Day of Resurrection will be the double-faced people who appear to some people with one face and to other people with another face."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.8, Hadith No.84)."
  4,146,"Except those who repent (from hypocrisy), do righteous good deeds, hold fast to Allâh, and purify their religion for Allâh (by worshipping none but Allâh, and do good for Allâh’s sake only, not to show off), then they will be with the believers. And Allâh will grant the believers a great reward.",""
  4,147,"Why should Allâh punish you if you have thanked (Him) and have believed in Him. And Allâh is Ever All-Appreciative (of good), All-Knowing.",""
