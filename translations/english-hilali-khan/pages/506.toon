  46,29,"And (remember) when We sent towards you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) a group (three to ten persons) of the jinn, (quietly) listening to the Qur’ân. When they stood in the presence thereof, they said: ""Listen in silence!"" And when it was finished, they returned to their people, as warners.",""
  46,30,"They said: ""O our people! Verily, we have heard a Book (this Qur’ân) sent down after Mûsâ (Moses), confirming what came before it: it guides to the truth and to the Straight Path (i.e. Islâm).",""
  46,31,"O our people! Respond (with obedience) to Allâh’s Caller (i.e. Allâh’s Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and believe in him (i.e. believe in that which Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم has brought from Allâh and follow him). He (Allâh) will forgive you of your sins, and will save you from a painful torment (i.e. Hell-fire)<sup>4</sup>","[4] (V.46:31) See the footnote of (V.3:85)."
  46,32,"And whosoever does not respond to Allâh’s Caller, he cannot escape on earth, and there will be no Auliyâ’ (lords, helpers, supporters, protectors) for him besides Allâh (from Allâh’s punishment). Those are in manifest error.",""
  46,33,"Do they not see that Allâh, Who created the heavens and the earth, and was not wearied by their creation, is Able to give life to the dead? Yes, He surely is Able to do all things.",""
  46,34,"And on the Day when those who disbelieve will be exposed to the Fire (it will be said to them): ""Is this not the truth?"" They will say: ""Yes, By our Lord!"" He will say: ""Then taste the torment, because you used to disbelieve!""",""
  46,35,"Therefore be patient (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as did the Messengers of strong will<sup>5</sup> and be in no haste about them (disbelievers). On the Day when they will see that (torment) with which they are promised (i.e. threatened, it will be) as if they had not stayed more than an hour in a single day. (O mankind! this Qur’ân is sufficient as) a clear Message (or proclamation to save yourself from destruction). But shall any be destroyed except the people who are Al-Fâsiqûn (the rebellious against Allâh’s Command, the disobedient to Allâh)?","[5] (V.46:35) There are many Prophets and Messengers of Allah, about twenty-five of them are mentioned in the Qur’an; out of these twenty-five, only five are of strong will: namely, Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, Nûh (Noah), Ibrâhîm (Abraham), Mûsâ (Moses) and ‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) عليها السلام ."
