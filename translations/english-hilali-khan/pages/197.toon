  9,62,"They swear by Allâh to you (Muslims) in order to please you, but it is more fitting that they should please Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), if they are believers.",""
  9,63,"Know they not that whoever opposes and shows hostility to Allâh (عز وجل) and His Messenger(صلى الله عليه وسلم), certainly for him will be the Fire of Hell to abide therein. That is the extreme disgrace.",""
  9,64,"The hypocrites fear lest a Sûrah (chapter of the Qur’ân) should be revealed about them, showing them what is in their hearts. Say: ""(Go ahead and) mock! But certainly Allâh will bring to light all that you fear.""",""
  9,65,"If you ask them (about this), they declare: ""We were only talking idly and joking."" Say: ""Was it at Allâh (عز وجل), and His Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations) and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) that you were mocking?""",""
  9,66,"Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were Mujrimûn (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals.).",""
  9,67,"The hypocrites, men and women, are one from another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief and polytheism of all kinds and all that Islâm has forbidden), and forbid (people) from Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and they close their hands [from giving (spending in Allâh’s Cause) alms]. They have forgotten Allâh, so He has forgotten them. Verily, the hypocrites are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh).",""
  9,68,"Allâh has promised the hypocrites - men and women - and the disbelievers, the Fire of Hell; therein shall they abide. It will suffice them. Allâh has cursed them and for them is the lasting torment.",""
