quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  34,40,"And (remember) the Day when He will gather them all together, then He will say to the angels: ""Was it you that these people used to worship?""",""
  34,41,"They (the angels) will say: ""Glorified be You! You are our Walî (Lord) instead of them. Nay, but they used to worship the jinn; most of them were believers in them.""",""
  34,42,"So Today (i.e. the Day of Resurrection), none of you can profit or harm one another. And We shall say to those who did wrong [i.e. worshipped others (like the angels, jinn, prophets, saints, righteous persons) along with Allâh]: ""Taste the torment of the Fire which you used to belie.<sup>3</sup>","[3] (V.34:42) Almighty Allâh says: ""They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords (by obeying them in things that they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by Allâh) besides Allâh, and (they also took as their Lord) Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] to worship none but one llâh (God - Allâh), Lâ ilâha illâ Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Praise and Glory is to Him, (far above is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him)."" [The Qur’ân, Verse 9:31]\nOnce, while Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم was reciting the above Verse, ‘Adi bin Hâtim said, ""O Allâh’s Prophet! They do not worship them (rabbis and monks)."" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""They certainly do. They (i.e. rabbis and monks) made legal things illegal, and illegal things legal, and they (i.e. Jews and Christians) followed them, and by doing so they really worshipped them."" [Narrated by Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Jarir. (Tafsîr At-Tabarî, Vol.10, Page No.114)]."
  34,43,"And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, they say: ""This (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) is naught but a man who wishes to hinder you from that which your fathers used to worship."" And they say: ""This (the Qur’ân) is nothing but an invented lie."" And those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them (i.e. Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم when Allâh sent him as a Messenger with proofs, evidence, verses of this Qur’ân, lessons, signs, etc.): ""This is nothing but evident magic!""",""
  34,44,"And We had not given them Scriptures which they could study, nor sent to them before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) any warner (Messenger).",""
  34,45,"And those before them belied; these have not received even a tenth of what We had granted to those (of old); yet they belied My Messengers. Then how (terrible) was My denial (punishment)!",""
  34,46,"Say (to them O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""I exhort you to one (thing) only: that you stand up for Allâh’s sake in pairs and singly, and reflect (within yourselves the life history of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم): there is no madness in your companion (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم). He is only a warner to you in face of a severe torment.""",""
  34,47,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""Whatever wage I might have asked of you is yours. My wage is from Allâh only, and He is a Witness over all things.""",""
  34,48,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""Verily my Lord sends down (Revelation and makes apparent) the truth (i.e. this Revelation that had come to me), the All-Knower of the Ghaib (Unseen).",""
