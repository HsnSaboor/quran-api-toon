quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  40,78,"And, indeed We have sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): of some of them We have related to you their story.<sup>10</sup> And of some We have not related to you their story, and it was not given to any Messenger that he should bring a sign except by the Leave of Allâh. But, when comes the Commandment of Allâh, the matter will be decided with truth, and the followers of falsehood will then be lost.","[10] (V.40:78) There are many Prophets and Messengers of Allâh. About twenty-five of them are mentioned in the Qur’an; out of these twenty-five, only five are of strong will, namely: Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, Nûh (Noah), Ibrâhîm (Abraham), Mûsâ (Moses), and ‘Îsâ (Jesus) - son of Maryam (Mary) عليهم السلام ."
  40,79,"Allâh, it is He Who has made cattle for you, that you may ride on some of them, and of some you eat.",""
  40,80,"And you have (many other) benefits from them, and that you may reach by their means a desire that is in your breasts (i.e. carry your goods, loads, etc.), and on them and on ships you are carried.",""
  40,81,"And He shows you His Ayât (signs and proofs) (of His Oneness in all the above-mentioned things). Which, then of the Ayât (signs and proofs) of Allâh do you deny?",""
  40,82,"Have they not travelled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them? They were more in number than them and mightier in strength, and in the traces (they have left behind them) in the land; yet all that they used to earn availed them not.",""
  40,83,"Then when their Messengers came to them with clear proofs, they were glad (and proud) with that which they had of the knowledge (of worldly things). And that at which they used to mock, surrounded them (i.e. the punishment).",""
  40,84,"So when they saw Our punishment, they said: ""We believe in Allâh Alone and reject (all) that we used to associate with Him as (His) partners.",""
  40,85,"Then their Faith (in Islâmic Monotheism) could not avail them when they saw Our punishment. (Like) this has been the way of Allâh in dealing with His slaves. And there the disbelievers lost utterly (when Our Torment covered them).",""
