  2,146,"Those to whom We gave the Scripture (Jews and Christians) recognise him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم or the Ka‘bah at Makkah) as they recognise their sons. But verily, a party of them conceal the truth while they know it - [i.e. the qualities of Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم which are written in the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)].<sup>30</sup>","[30] (V.2:146) See the footnote of (V.2:42) (Qualities of Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)."
  2,147,"(This is) the truth from your Lord. So be you not one of those who doubt.",""
  2,148,"For every nation there is a direction to which they face (in their prayers). So hasten towards all that is good. Wheresoever you may be, Allâh will bring you together (on the Day of Resurrection). Truly, Allâh is Able to do all things.",""
  2,149,"And from wheresoever you start forth (for prayers), turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid-Al-Harâm (at Makkah), that is indeed the truth from your Lord. And Allâh is not unaware of what you do.",""
  2,150,"And from wheresoever you start forth (for prayers), turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid-Al-Harâm (at Makkah), and wheresoever you are, turn your faces towards it (when you pray) so that men may have no argument against you except those of them that are wrong-doers, so fear them not, but fear Me! - And so that I may complete My Blessings on you and that you may be guided.",""
  2,151,"Similarly (to complete My Blessings on you), We have sent among you a Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) of your own, reciting to you Our Verses (the Qur’ân) and purifying you, and teaching you the Book (the Qur’ân) and the Hikmah (i.e. Sunnah, Islâmic laws and Fiqh - jurisprudence), and teaching you that which you used not to know.",""
  2,152,"Therefore remember Me (by praying, glorifying),<sup>31</sup> I will remember you, and be grateful to Me (for My countless Favours on you) and never be ungrateful to Me.","[31] (V.2:152)\na) See the footnote of (V.13:28).\nb) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Allâh عز وجل says, I am just as My slave thinks I am, (i.e. I am Able to do for him what he thinks I can do for him) and I am with him if he remembers Me. If he remembers Me in himself, I too, remember him in Myself; and if he remembers Me in a group of people, I remember him in a group that is better than them; and if he comes one span nearer to Me, I go one cubit nearer to him; and if he comes one cubit nearer to Me, I go a distance of two outstretched arms nearer to him; and if he comes to Me walking, I go to him running. (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.9, Hadîth No.502)."
  2,153,"O you who believe! Seek help in patience and As-Salât (the prayer). Truly! Allâh is with As-Sâbirûn (the patient).",""
