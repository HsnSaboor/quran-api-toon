quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,88,"The chiefs of those who were arrogant among his people said: ""We shall certainly drive you out, O Shu‘aib, and those who have believed with you from our town, or else you (all) shall return to our religion."" He said: ""Even though we hate it!?""",""
  7,89,"""We should have invented a lie against Allâh if we returned to your religion, after Allâh has rescued us from it. And it is not for us to return to it unless Allâh, our Lord, should will. Our Lord comprehends all things in His Knowledge. In Allâh (Alone) we put our trust. Our Lord! Judge between us and our people in truth, for You are the Best of those who give judgment.""",""
  7,90,"The chiefs of those who disbelieved among his people said (to their people): ""If you follow Shu‘aib, be sure then you will be the losers!""",""
  7,91,"So the earthquake seized them and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes.",""
  7,92,"Those who belied Shu‘aib, became as if they had never dwelt there (in their homes). Those who belied Shu‘aib, they were the losers.",""
  7,93,"Then he (Shu‘aib) turned from them and said: ""O my people! I have indeed conveyed my Lord’s Messages unto you and I have given you good advice. Then how can I sorrow for the disbelieving people’s (destruction).""",""
  7,94,"And We sent no Prophet unto any town (and they denied him), but We seized its people with suffering from extreme poverty (or loss in wealth) and loss of health (and calamities), so that they might humiliate themselves (and repent to Allâh).",""
  7,95,"Then We changed the evil for the good, until they increased in number and in wealth, and said: ""Our fathers were touched with evil (loss of health and calamities) and with good (prosperity)."" So We seized them all of a sudden while they were unaware.",""
