  11,47,"Nûh (Noah) said: ""O my Lord! I seek refuge with You from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have Mercy on me, I will indeed be one of the losers.""",""
  11,48,"It was said: ""O Nûh (Noah)! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you (and on some of their off-spring), but (there will be other) people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.""",""
  11,49,"This is of the news of the Unseen which We reveal unto you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم); neither you nor your people knew it before this. So be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2)",""
