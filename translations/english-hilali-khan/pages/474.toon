quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  40,59,"Verily, the Hour (Day of Judgement) is surely coming, there is no doubt about it, yet most men believe not.",""
  40,60,"And your Lord said: ""Invoke Me, [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islâmic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation). Verily! Those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness, (Islâmic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!""",""
  40,61,"Allâh, it is He Who has made the night for you that you may rest therein and the day for you to see. Truly, Allâh is full of Bounty to mankind; yet, most of mankind give no thanks.",""
  40,62,"That is Allâh, your Lord, the Creator of all things: Lâ ilâha illâ Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). How then are you turning away (from Allâh, by worshipping others instead of Him)?",""
  40,63,"Thus were turned away those who used to deny the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh.",""
  40,64,"Allâh, it is He Who has made for you the earth as a dwelling place and the sky as a canopy, and has given you shape and made your shapes good (looking) and has provided you with good things. That is Allâh, your Lord: so Blessed be Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists).",""
  40,65,"He is the Ever Living, Lâ ilâha illâ Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He); so invoke Him making your worship pure for Him Alone (by worshipping Him Alone, and none else, and by doing righteous deeds sincerely for Allâh’s sake only, and not to show off, and not setting up rivals with Him in worship). All the praises and thanks be to Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists).",""
  40,66,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""I have been forbidden to worship those whom you worship besides Allâh, since there have come to me evidence from my Lord; and I am commanded to submit (in Islâm) to the Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists).",""
