  27,36,"So when (the messengers with the present) came to Sulaimân (Solomon), he said: ""Will you help me in wealth? What Allâh has given me is better than that which He has given you! Nay, you rejoice in your gift!""",""
  27,37,"[Then Sulaimân (Solomon) said to the chief of her messengers who brought the present]: ""Go back to them. We verily shall come to them with hosts that they cannot resist, and we shall drive them out from there in disgrace, and they will be abased.""",""

  27,40,"One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: ""I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye!"" Then when he [Sulaimân (Solomon)] saw it placed before him, he said: ""This is by the Grace of my Lord - to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! And whoever is grateful, truly, his gratitude is for (the good of) his ownself; and whoever is ungrateful, (he is ungrateful only for the loss of his ownself). Certainly my Lord is Rich (Free of all needs), Bountiful.""",""

Verily, I have wronged myself, and I submit [in Islâm, together with Sulaimân (Solomon)] to Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists).""",""
