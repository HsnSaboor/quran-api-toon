quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,131,"But whenever good came to them, they said: ""Ours is this."" And if evil afflicted them, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Mûsâ (Moses) and those with him. Be informed! Verily, their evil omens are with Allâh but most of them know not.",""
  7,132,"They said [to Mûsâ (Moses)]: ""Whatever Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) you may bring to us, to work therewith your sorcery on us, we shall never believe in you.""",""
  7,133,"So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, and the blood (as a succession of) manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were Mujrimûn (criminals, polytheists, sinners).",""
  7,134,"And when the punishment fell on them they said: ""O Mûsâ (Moses)! Invoke your Lord for us because of His Promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.""",""
  7,135,"But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!",""
  7,136,"So We took retribution from them. We drowned them in the sea, because they belied Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and were heedless about them.",""
  7,137,"And We made the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We have blessed. And the fair Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because of their endurance. And We destroyed completely all the great works and buildings which Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his people erected.",""
