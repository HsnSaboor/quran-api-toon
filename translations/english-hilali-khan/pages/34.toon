  2,216,"Jihâd <sup>51</sup> (holy fighting in Allâh’s cause) is ordained for you (Muslims) though you dislike it, and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allâh knows but you do not know.","[51] (V.2:216) See the footnote of (V.2:190)."
  2,217,"They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months (i.e. 1st, 7th, 11th and 12th months of the Islâmic calendar). Say ""Fighting therein is a great (transgression) but a greater (transgression)<sup>52</sup> with Allâh is to prevent mankind from following the Way of Allâh, to disbelieve in Him, to prevent access to Al-Masjid-Al-Harâm (at Makkah), and to drive out its inhabitants, and Al-Fitnah<sup>53</sup> is worse than killing. And they will never cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion (Islâmic Monotheism) if they can. And whosoever of you turns back from his religion and dies as a disbeliever, then his deeds will be lost in this life and in the Hereafter, and they will be the dwellers of the Fire. They will abide therein forever.""","[52] (V.2:217) The provision of this Verse has been abrogated by Verse 9:36. Jihâd cf., (V.2:216). \n[53] (V.2:217) Fitnah: polytheism and to disbelieve after one has believed in Allâh, or a trial or a calamity or an affliction or to set up rivals in worship with Allâh, etc."

  2,219,"They ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) concerning alcoholic drink and gambling.<sup>54</sup> Say: ""In them is a great sin, and (some) benefit for men, but the sin of them is greater than their benefit.""

Thus Allâh makes clear to you His Laws in order that you may give thought."" <sup>55</sup>","[54] (V.2:219):\n a) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Whoever takes an oath in which he (forgetfully), mentions Lat and ‘Uzza (i.e. two idols of Arab pagans) should say: ""La ilaha illallâh"" (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh), and whoever says to his companion, ‘Come along, let us gamble,’ must give alms (as an expiation).""
