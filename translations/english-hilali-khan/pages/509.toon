  47,20,"Those who believe say: ""Why is not a Sûrah (chapter of the Qur’ân) sent down (for us)? But when a decisive Sûrah (explaining and ordering things) is sent down, and fighting (Jihâd - holy fighting in Allâh’s cause) is mentioned (i.e. ordained) therein, you will see those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy) looking at you with a look of one fainting to death. But it was better for them (hypocrites, to listen to Allâh and to obey Him).",""
  47,21,"Obedience (to Allâh) and good words (were better for them). And when the matter (preparation for Jihâd ) is resolved on, then if they had been true to Allâh, it would have been better for them.",""
  47,22,"Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship?<sup>6</sup>","[6] (V.47:22).\na) Narrated Abû Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Allâh created His creation, and when He finished it, the womb got up and caught hold of Allâh whereupon Allâh said, ‘What is the matter?’ On that, it said, ‘I seek refuge with you from Al-qatî‘âh (those who sever the ties of kith and kin).’ On that Allâh said, ‘Will you accept (be satisfied) if I bestow My Favours on him who keeps your ties, and withhold My Favours from him who severs your ties?’ On that it said, ‘Yes, O my Lord!’ Then Allâh said, ‘That is for you.’ Abu Hurairah added: If you wish, you can recite: ""Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land and sever your ties of kinship?"" (V.47:22). (Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadîth No.354).\nb) See the footnote of (V.2:27)."
  47,23,"Such are they whom Allâh has cursed, so that He has made them deaf and blinded their sight.",""
  47,24,"Do they not then think deeply in the Qur’ân, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?",""
  47,25,"Verily, those who have turned back (have apostatised) as disbelievers after the guidance has been manifested to them - Shaitân (Satan) has beautified for them (their false hopes), and (Allâh) prolonged their term (age).",""
  47,26,"This is because they said to those who hate what Allâh has sent down: ""We will obey you in part of the matter."" But Allâh knows their secrets.",""
  47,27,"Then how (will it be) when the angels will take their souls at death, smiting their faces and their backs?",""
  47,28,"That is because they followed that which angered Allâh and hated that which pleased Him. So He made their deeds fruitless.",""
  47,29,"Or do those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy), think that Allâh will not bring to light all their hidden ill-wills?<sup>7</sup>","[7] (V.47:29) See hypocrisy in the Appendix II"
