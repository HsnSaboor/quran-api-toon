  17,78,"Perform As-Salât (Iqamât-as-Salât)<sup>12</sup> from mid-day till the darkness of the night (i.e. the Zuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib and ‘Ishâ’ prayers), and recite the Qur’ân in the early dawn (i.e. the morning prayer). Verily, the recitation of the Qur’ân in the early dawn is ever witnessed (attended by the angels in charge of mankind of the day and the night)<sup>13</sup>.","[12] (V.17:78) See the glossary.\n[13] (V.17:78)\nNarrated Abu Salâmah bin ‘Abdur-Râhman: Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه said, ""I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, ‘The reward of a Salât (prayer) in congregation is twenty-five times superior in degrees to that of a Salât (prayer) offered by a person alone. The angels of the night and the angels of the day gather at the time of Fajr prayer.’ ""\nAbu Hurairah then added, ""Recite the Holy Book if you wish, for ‘Verily, the recitation of the Qur’ân in the early dawn (Fajr prayer) is ever witnessed (attended by the angels in charge of mankind of the day and the night)’ (V.17:78)"".

  17,79,"And in some parts of the night (also) offer the Salât (prayer) with it (i.e. recite the Qur’ân in the prayer), as an additional prayer (Tahajjud optional prayer - Nawâfil) for you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم). It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqâm Mahmûd (a station of praise and glory, i.e. the honour of intercession on the Day of Resurrection.)<sup>14</sup>.","[14] (V.17:79)\nA). Narrated Ibn ‘Umar رضي الله عنهما ""On the Day of Resurrection the people will fall on their knees and every nation will follow their Prophet and they will say, ‘O so-and-so! Intercede (for us with Allâh)’, till (the right of) of intercession will be given to the Prophet (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and that will be the day when Allâh will raise him to Maqâm Mahmûd (a station of praise and glory i.e the honour of intercession on the Day of Resurrection)"". (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadith No.242)\nB). Narrated Jâbir bin ‘Abdullâhرضي الله عنهما: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Whoever, after listening to the Adhân (call for the prayer) says, ‘O Allâh, the Lord of this complete call and of this prayer, which is going to be established! Give Muhammad Al-Wasîlah and Al-Fadîlah* and raise him to Maqâm Mahmûd , which You have promised him,’ will be granted my intercession for him on the Day of Resurrection."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadith No.243).\n* Al-Wasîlah is the highest position in Paradise which is granted to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم particularly; Al-Fadîlah is the extra degree of honour which is bestowed on him above all creation."
  17,80,"And say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم): My Lord! Let my entry (to the city of Al-Madinah) be good, and (likewise) my exit (from the city of Makkah) be good. And grant me from You an authority to help me (or a firm sign or a proof).",""

  17,82,"And We send down of the Qur’ân that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe (in Islâmic Monotheism and act on it), and it increases the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) nothing but loss.",""
  17,83,"And when We bestow Our Grace on man (the disbeliever), he turns away and becomes arrogant (far away from the Right Path). And when evil touches him, he is in great despair.",""
