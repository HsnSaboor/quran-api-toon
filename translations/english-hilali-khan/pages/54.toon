  3,32,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""Obey Allâh and the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)."" But if they turn away, then Allâh does not like the disbelievers<sup>5</sup>.","[5] (V.3:32) See the footnote of (V.3:85)."

Verily, Allâh provides sustenance to whom He wills, without limit.""","[7] (V.3:37) Al-Mihrâb: a praying place or a private room."
