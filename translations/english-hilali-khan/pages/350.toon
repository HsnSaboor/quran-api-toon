  24,1,"(This is) a Sûrah (chapter of the Qur’ân) which We have sent down and which We have enjoined, (ordained its laws); and in it We have revealed manifest Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations - lawful and unlawful things, and set boundaries of Islâmic Religion), that you may remember.",""
  24,2,"The fornicatress and the fornicator, flog each of them with a hundred stripes. Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by Allâh, if you believe in Allâh and the Last Day. And let a party of the believers witness their punishment. (This punishment is for unmarried persons guilty of the above crime, but if married persons commit it (illegal sex), the punishment is to stone them to death, according to Allâh’s Law).<sup>1</sup>","[1] (V.24:2)\na) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم judged that the unmarried person who was guilty of illegal sexual intercourse be exiled for one year and receive the legal punishment (i.e., be flogged with one hundred stripes). (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.8, Hadith No. 819)\nb) Narrated Jâbir bin ‘Abdullâh Al-Ansâri رضي الله عنهما: A man from the tribe of Bani Aslam came to Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم and informed him that he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and he bore witness four times against himself. Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم ordered him to be stoned to death as he was a married person. (Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.805).\nc) See (V.4:25)."
  24,3,"The adulterer-fornicator marries not but an adulteress-fornicatress or a Mushrikah, and the adulteress-fornicatress none marries her except an adulterer-fornicator or a Muskrik [and that means that the man who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan or idolatress) or a prostitute, then surely he is either an adulterer-fornicator, or a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater). And the woman who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater) or an adulterer-fornicator, then she is either a prostitute or a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan, or idolatress)]. Such a thing is forbidden to the believers (of Islâmic Monotheism).",""
  24,4,"And those who accuse chaste women, and produce not four witnesses, flog them with eighty stripes, and reject their testimony forever. They indeed are the Fâsiqûn (liars, rebellious, disobedient to Allâh).",""
