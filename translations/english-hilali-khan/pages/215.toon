quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  10,54,"And if every person who had wronged (by disbelieving in Allâh and by worshipping others besides Allâh) possessed all that is on the earth and sought to ransom himself therewith (it will not be accepted), and they would feel in their hearts regret when they see the torment, and they will be judged with justice, and no wrong will be done unto them.<sup>9</sup>","[9] (V.10:54) See the footnote of (V.3:91)."
  10,55,"No doubt, surely, all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allâh. No doubt, surely, Allâh’s Promise is true. But most of them know not.",""
  10,56,"It is He Who gives life, and causes death, and to Him you (all) shall return.",""
  10,57,"O mankind! There has come to you a good advice from your Lord (i.e. the Qur’ân, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil), and a healing for that (disease of ignorance, doubt, hypocrisy and differences) which is in your breasts, - a guidance and a mercy (explaining lawful and unlawful things) for the believers.",""
  10,58,"Say: ""In the Bounty of Allâh, and in His Mercy (i.e. Islâm and the Qur’ân); - therein let them rejoice."" That is better than what (the wealth) they amass.",""
  10,59,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to these polytheists): ""Tell me, what provision Allâh has sent down to you! And you have made of it lawful and unlawful."" Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""Has Allâh permitted you (to do so), or do you invent a lie against Allâh?""",""
  10,60,"And what think those who invent a lie against Allâh, on the Day of Resurrection? [i.e. Do they think that they will be forgiven and excused! Nay, they will have an eternal punishment in the Fire of Hell]. Truly, Allâh is full of Bounty to mankind, but most of them are ungrateful.",""
  10,61,"Neither you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) do any deed nor recite any portion of the Qur’ân, - nor you (mankind) do any deed (good or evil) but We are Witness thereof, when you are doing it. And nothing is hidden from your Lord (so much as) the weight of an atom (or small ant) on the earth or in the heaven. Not what is less than that or what is greater than that but is (written) in a Clear Record. (Tafsir At-Tabarî).",""
