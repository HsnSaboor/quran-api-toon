quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,30,"And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: ""Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth."" They said: ""Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, - while we glorify You with praises and thanks and sanctify You."" He (Allâh) said: ""I know that which you do not know.""",""
  2,31,"And He taught Adam all the names (of everything)<sup>8</sup>, then He showed them to the angels and said, ""Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful.""","[8] (V.2:31) The Statement of Allâh تعالى: ‘And He taught Adam all the names (of everything).’ Narrated Anas رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""On the Day of Resurrection the believers will assemble and say, ‘Let us ask somebody to intercede for us with our Lord.’ So they will go to Adam and say, ‘You are the father of all the people, and Allâh created you with His Own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate themselves to you, and taught you the names of all things; so please intercede for us with our Lord, so that He may relieve us from this place of ours.’ Adam will say, ‘I am not fit for this (i.e. intercession for you).’ Then Adam will remember his sin and feel ashamed thereof. He will say, ‘Go to Nûh (Noah), for he was the first Messenger Allâh sent to the inhabitants of the earth.’ They will go to him and Nûh (Noah) will say, ‘I am not fit for this undertaking.’ He will remember his appeal to his Lord to do something of which he had no knowledge, then he will feel ashamed thereof and will say, ‘Go to Khalil-ur-Rahmân. * [i.e. Ibrâhîm (Abraham)]. They will go to him and will say, ‘I am not fit for this undertaking. Go to Mûsâ (Moses), the slave to whom Allâh spoke (directly) and gave him the Taurât (Torah).’ So they will go to him and he will say, ‘I am not fit for this undertaking,’ and he will mention (his) killing a person who was not a killer, and so he will feel ashamed thereof before his Lord, and he will say, ‘Go to ‘Îsâ (Jesus), Allâh’s slave, His Messenger and Allâh’s Word and a spirit coming from Him. ** ‘Îsâ (Jesus) will say, ‘I am not fit for this undertaking, go to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم the slave of Allâh whose past and future sins were forgiven by Allâh.’ So they will come to me and I will proceed till I ask my Lord’s Permission and I will be given permission. When I see my Lord, I will fall down in prostration and He will let me remain in that state as long as He wishes and then I will be addressed. ‘(Muhammad!) Raise your head. Ask, and your request will be granted; say and your saying will be listened to; intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.’ I will raise my head and praise Allâh with a saying (i.e. invocation) He will teach me, and then I will intercede. He will fix a limit for me (to intercede) whom I will admit into Paradise. Then I will come back again to Allâh, and when I see my Lord, the same thing will happen to me. And then I will intercede and Allâh will fix a limit for me (to intercede) whom I will admit into Paradise, then I will come back for the third time; and then I will come back for the fourth time, and He will say, ‘None remains in Hell but those whom the Qur’ân has imprisoned (in Hell) and who have been destined to an eternal stay in Hell.’"" (The compiler) Abu ‘Abdullâh said; ‘But those whom the Qur’ân has imprisoned in Hell’ refers to the statement of Allâh عز وجل: ""To abide therein ... V.16:29"" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.6, Hadîth No. 3).\n* The intimate friend of the Most Gracious (Allâh).\n** This may wrongly be understood as the spirit or soul of Allâh, in fact, it is a soul created by Allâh, i.e. ‘Îsâ (Jesus). It was His Word: ""Be!"" - and he was (created like the creation of Adam). Please see the word Rûh-ullâh in the glossary for further details."
  2,32,"They (angels) said: ""Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what you have taught us. Verily, it is You, the All-Knower, the All-Wise.""",""
  2,33,"He said: ""O Adam! Inform them of their names,"" and when he had informed them of their names, He said: ""Did I not tell you that I know the Ghaib (Unseen) in the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you have been concealing?""",""
  2,34,"And (remember) when We said to the angels: ""Prostrate yourselves before Adam."". And they prostrated except Iblîs (Satan), he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allâh).",""
  2,35,"And We said: ""O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight, of things therein as wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers).""",""
  2,36,"Then the Shaitân (Satan) made them slip therefrom (the Paradise), and got them out from that in which they were. We said: ""Get you down, all, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time.""",""
  2,37,"Then Adam received from his Lord Words.<sup>9</sup> And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily, He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the Most Merciful.","[9] (V.2:37): These words are mentioned in the Qur’ân; (Verse 7:23): They are: ""Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers."""
