quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,41,"March forth, whether you are light (being healthy, young and wealthy) or heavy (being ill, old and poor), and strive hard with your wealth and your lives in the Cause of Allâh. This is better for you, if you but knew.",""
  9,42,"Had it been a near gain (booty in front of them) and an easy journey, they would have followed you, but the distance (Tabuk expedition) was long for them; and they would swear by Allâh, ""If we only could, we would certainly have come forth with you."" They destroy their ownselves, and Allâh knows that they are liars.",""
  9,43,"May Allâh forgive you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم). Why did you grant them leave (for remaining behind; you should have persisted as regards your order to them to proceed on Jihâd ), until those who told the truth were seen by you in a clear light, and you had known the liars?",""
  9,44,"Those who believe in Allâh and the Last Day would not ask your leave to be exempted from fighting with their properties and their lives; and Allâh is the All-Knower of Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2).",""
  9,45,"It is only those who believe not in Allâh and the Last Day and whose hearts are in doubt that ask your leave (to be exempted from Jihâd). So in their doubts they waver.",""
  9,46,"And if they had intended to march out, certainly, they would have made some preparation for it; but Allâh was averse to their being sent forth, so He made them lag behind, and it was said (to them), ""Sit you among those who sit (at home).""",""
  9,47,"Had they marched out with you, they would have added to you nothing except disorder, and they would have hurried about in your midst (spreading corruption) and sowing sedition among you - and there are some among you who would have listened to them. And Allâh is the All-Knower of the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).",""
