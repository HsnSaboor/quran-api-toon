  43,12,"And Who has created all the pairs and has appointed for you ships and cattle on which you ride:",""
  43,13,"In order that you may mount on their backs, and then may remember the Favour of your Lord when you mount thereon, and say: ""Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could never have it (by our efforts).",""

  43,15,"Yet, they assign to some of His slaves a share with Him (by pretending that He has children, and considering them as equals or co-partners in worship with Him). Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!",""
