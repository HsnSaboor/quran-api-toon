quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,80,"Whether you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) ask forgiveness for them (hypocrites) or ask not forgiveness for them - (and even) if you ask seventy times for their forgiveness - Allâh will not forgive them because they have disbelieved in Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم). And Allâh guides not those people who are Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh).",""
  9,81,"Those who stayed away (from Tabuk expedition) rejoiced in their staying behind the Messenger of Allâh; they hated to strive and fight with their properties and their lives in the Cause of Allâh, and they said: ""March not forth in the heat."" Say: ""The Fire of Hell is more intense in heat""; if only they could understand!",""
  9,82,"So let them laugh a little and (they will) cry much as a recompense of what they used to earn (by committing sins).",""
  9,83,"If Allâh brings you back to a party of them (the hypocrites), and they ask your permission to go out (to fight), say: ""Never shall you go out with me nor fight an enemy with me; you were pleased to sit (inactive) on the first occasion, then you sit (now) with those who lag behind.""",""
  9,84,"And never (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) pray (funeral prayer) for any of them (hypocrites) who dies, nor stand at his grave. Certainly they disbelieved in Allâh and His Messenger, and died while they were Fâsiqûn (rebellious, - disobedient to Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم).",""
  9,85,"And let not their wealth or their children amaze you. Allâh’s Plan is to punish them with these things in this world, and that their souls shall depart (die) while they are disbelievers.",""
  9,86,"And when a Sûrah (chapter from the Qur’ân) is revealed, enjoining them to believe in Allâh and to strive hard and fight along with His Messenger, the wealthy among them ask your leave to exempt them (from Jihâd) and say, ""Leave us (behind), we would be with those who sit (at home).""",""
