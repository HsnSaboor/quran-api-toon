  23,60,"And those who give that (their charity) which they give (and also do other good deeds) with their hearts full of fear (whether their alms and charities have been accepted or not),<sup>3</sup> because they are sure to return to their Lord (for reckoning).","[3] (V.23:60) Narrated ‘Âishah رضي الله عنها (the wife of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم), I asked Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم about this (following Verse): ""And those who give that (their charity) which they give (and also do other good deeds) with their hearts full of fear ..."" (V.23:60).\nShe added: ""Are these who drink alcoholic drinks and steal?"" Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم replied: ""No! O the daughter of As-Siddîq, but they are those who fast, pray, and practise charity and they are afraid that (their good) deeds may not be accepted (by Allâh) from them. ‘It is these who hasten in good deeds.’ "" (Sunan At-Tirmidhi Hadith No.3225), (Tafsîr Al-Qurtubî)."
  23,61,"It is these who hasten in the good deeds, and they are foremost in them [e.g. offering the compulsory Salât (prayers) in their (early) stated, fixed times and so on].",""
  23,62,"And We task not any person except according to his capacity, and with Us is a Record which speaks the truth, and they will not be wronged.",""
  23,63,"Nay, but their hearts are covered from (understanding) this (the Qur’ân), and they have other (evil) deeds, besides, which they are doing.",""
  23,64,"Until when We seize those of them who lead a luxurious life with punishment: behold they make humble invocation with a loud voice.",""
  23,65,"Invoke not loudly this day! Certainly you shall not be helped by Us.",""
  23,66,"Indeed My Verses used to be recited to you, but you used to turn back on your heels (denying them, and refusing with hatred to listen to them).",""
  23,67,"In pride (they - Quraish pagans and polytheists of Makkah used to feel proud that they are the dwellers of Makkah sanctuary - Haram), talking evil about it (the Qur’ân) by night.",""
  23,68,"Have they not pondered over the Word (of Allâh, i.e. what is sent down to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم), or has there come to them what had not come to their fathers of old?",""
  23,69,"Or is it that they did not recognize their Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) so they deny him?",""
  23,70,"Or say they: There is madness in him? Nay, but he brought them the truth [i.e. Tauhîd: Worshipping Allâh Alone in all aspects, the Qur’ân and the religion of Islâm], but most of them (the disbelievers) are averse to the truth.",""
  23,71,"And if the truth had been in accordance with their desires, verily, the heavens and the earth, and whosoever is therein would have been corrupted! Nay, We have brought them their reminder, but they turn away from their reminder.",""
  23,72,"Or is it that you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) ask them for some wages? But the recompense of your Lord is better, and He is the Best of those who give sustenance.",""
  23,73,"And certainly, you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) call them to the Straight Path (true religion - Islâmic Monotheism).",""
  23,74,"And verily, those who believe not in the Hereafter are indeed deviating far astray from the Path (true religion - Islâmic Monotheism).",""
