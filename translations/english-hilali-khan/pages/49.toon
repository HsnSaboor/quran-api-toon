quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,283,"And if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then let there be a pledge taken (mortgaging)<sup>78</sup>; then if one of you entrust the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully), and let him be afraid of Allâh, his Lord. And conceal not the evidence for he, who hides it, surely his heart is sinful. And Allâh is All-Knower of what you do.","[78] (V.2:283) Narrated ‘Âishah رضي الله عنها: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم bought some foodstuff on credit for a limited period and mortgaged his armour for it. (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 3, Hadîth No.686)"
  2,284,"To Allâh belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and whether you disclose what is in your ownselves or conceal it, Allâh will call you to account for it. Then He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And Allâh is Able to do all things.",""
  2,285,"The Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allâh, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say), ""We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers"" - and they say, ""We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).""",""
  2,286,"Allâh burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. ""Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians); our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us Forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Maulâ (Patron, Supporter and Protector, etc.) and give us victory over the disbelieving people.<sup>79</sup>""","[79] (V.2:286) Narrated Abu Mas‘ûd Al-Badri رضي الله عنه Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Whosoever recited the last two Verses of Sûrat Al-Baqarah at night, that will be sufficient for him."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 5, Hadîth No.345)."
