  8,17,"You killed them not, but Allâh killed them. And you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) threw not when you did throw, but Allâh threw, that He might test the believers by a fair trial from Him. Verily, Allâh is All-Hearer, All-Knower.",""
  8,18,"This (is the fact) and surely, Allâh weakens the deceitful plots of the disbelievers.",""
  8,19,"(O disbelievers) if you ask for a judgement, now has the judgement come unto you; and if you cease (to do wrong), it will be better for you, and if you return (to the attack), so shall We return, and your forces will be of no avail to you, however numerous they be; and verily, Allâh is with the believers.",""
  8,20,"O you who believe! Obey Allâh and His Messenger, and turn not away from him (i.e. Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) while you are hearing.",""

And verily to Him you shall (all) be gathered.","[1] (V.8:24) See the footnote of (V.1:2).\n[2] (V.8:24) i.e., one is alive, - a true believer (of Islâmic Monotheism) who is obedient to Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and follows the Qur’ân and Prophet’s Sunnah practically, and he goes out for Jihâd in Allâh’s Cause; in case he is martyred, that is not a death but an eternal life (in Paradise) forever, unlike to a disbeliever who is dead (as regards faith), and will be punished in Hell forever (neither alive nor dead)."
