quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  58,1,"Indeed Allâh has heard the statement of her (Khaulah bint Tha‘labah) that disputes with you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) concerning her husband (Aus bin As-Sâmit), and complains to Allâh. And Allâh hears the argument between you both. Verily, Allâh is All-Hearer, All-Seer.",""
  58,2,"Those among you who make their wives unlawful to them by (Zihâr الظهار)<sup>1</sup> (i.e. by saying to them ""You are like my mother’s back,"") they cannot be their mothers. None can be their mothers except those who gave them birth. And verily, they utter an ill word and a lie. And verily, Allâh is Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.","[1] (V.58:2) Az-Zihâr الظهار is the saying of a husband to his wife: You are to me like the back of my mother (i.e. unlawful for me to approach)."
  58,3,"And those who make unlawful to them their wives by Zihâr and wish to free themselves from what they uttered, (the penalty) in that case is the freeing of a slave before they touch each other. That is an admonition to you (so that you may not repeat such an ill thing). And Allâh is All-Aware of what you do.",""
  58,4,"And he who finds not (the money for freeing a slave) must fast two successive months before they both touch each other. And he who is unable to do so, should feed sixty Miskîns (poor). That is in order that you may have perfect Faith in Allâh and His Messenger. These are the limits set by Allâh. And for disbelievers, there is a painful torment.",""
  58,5,"Verily, those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)<sup>2</sup> will be disgraced, as those before them (among the past nation) were disgraced. And We have sent down clear Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.). And for the disbelievers is a disgracing torment.","[2] (V.58:5) See the footnote of (V.3:85)."
  58,6,"On the Day when Allâh will resurrect them all together (i.e. on the Day of Resurrection) and inform them of what they did. Allâh has kept account of it, while they have forgotten it. And Allâh is Witness over all things.",""
