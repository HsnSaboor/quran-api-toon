quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  33,16,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to these hypocrites who ask your permission to run away from you): ""Flight will not avail you if you flee from death or killing and then you will enjoy no more than a little while!""",""
  33,17,"Say: ""Who is he who can protect you from Allâh if He intends to harm you, or intends mercy on you?"" And they will not find, besides Allâh, for themselves any Walî (protector, supporter) or any helper.",""
  33,18,"Allâh already knows those among you who keep back (men) from fighting in Allâh’s Cause, and those who say to their brethren ""Come here towards us,"" while they (themselves) come not to the battle except a little,",""
  33,19,"Being miserly towards you (as regards help and aid in Allâh’s Cause). Then when fear comes, you will see them looking to you, their eyes revolving like (those of) one over whom hovers death; but when the fear departs, they will smite you with sharp tongues, miserly towards (spending anything in any) good (and only covetous of booty and wealth). Such have not believed. Therefore Allâh makes their deeds fruitless and that is ever easy for Allâh.",""
  33,20,"They think that Al-Ahzâb (the Confederates) have not yet withdrawn; and if Al-Ahzâb (the Confederates) should come (again), they would wish they were in the deserts (wandering) among the bedouins, seeking news about you (from a far place); and if they (happen) to be among you, they would not fight but little.",""
  33,21,"Indeed in the Messenger of Allâh (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allâh and the Last Day, and remembers Allâh much.",""
  33,22,"And when the believers saw Al-Ahzâb (the Confederates), they said: ""This is what Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) had promised us; and Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) had spoken the truth. And it only added to their Faith and to their submissiveness (to Allâh).",""
