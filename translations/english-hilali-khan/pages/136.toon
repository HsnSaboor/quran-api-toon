quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,69,"Those who fear Allâh, keep their duty to Him and avoid evil are not responsible for them (the disbelievers) in any case, but (their duty) is to remind them, that they may fear Allah (and refrain from mocking at the Qur’ân). [The provision of this Verse was abrogated by the Verse 4:140].",""
  6,70,"And leave alone those who take their religion as play and amusement, and whom the life of this world has deceived. But remind (them) with it (the Qur’ân) lest a person be given up to destruction for that which he has earned, when he will find for himself no protector or intercessor besides Allâh, and even if he offers every ransom, it will not be accepted from him. Such are they who are given up to destruction because of that which they have earned. For them will be a drink of boiling water and a painful torment because they used to disbelieve.",""
  6,71,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""Shall we invoke others besides Allâh (false deities), that can do us neither good nor harm, and shall we turn back on our heels after Allâh has guided us (to true Monotheism)? - like one whom the Shayâtîn (devils) have made to go astray in the land in confusion, his companions calling him to guidance (saying): ‘Come to us.’ "" Say: ""Verily, Allâh’s Guidance is the only guidance, and we have been commanded to submit (ourselves) to the Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists);",""
  6,72,"And to perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and to be obedient to Allâh and fear Him, and it is He to Whom you shall be gathered.",""
  6,73,"It is He Who has created the heavens and the earth in truth, and on the Day (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) He will say: ""Be!"", - and it is! His Word is the Truth. His will be the dominion on the Day when the Trumpet will be blown. All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the All-Wise, Well-Aware (of all things).",""
