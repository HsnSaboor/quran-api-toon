quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  48,29,"Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is the Messenger of Allâh. And those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking Bounty from Allâh and (His) Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Taurât (Torah). But their description in the Injeel (Gospel) is like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, and becomes thick and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. Allâh has promised those among them who believe (i.e. all those who follow Islâmic Monotheism, the religion of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم till the Day of Resurrection) and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward (i.e. Paradise).",""
  49,1,"O you who believe! Make not (a decision) in advance<sup>1</sup> before Allâh and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), and fear Allâh. Verily! Allâh is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.","[1] (V.49:1) i.e. hasten not to decide in matters of war or religion before Allah and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, that you may decide the contrary to what Allah and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم may decide."
  49,2,"O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم), nor speak aloud to him in talk as you speak aloud to one another, lest your deeds should be rendered fruitless while you perceive not.",""
  49,3,"Verily, those who lower their voices in the presence of Allâh’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), they are the ones whose hearts Allâh has tested for piety. For them is forgiveness and a great reward.",""
  49,4,"Verily those who call you from behind the dwellings, most of them have no sense.",""
