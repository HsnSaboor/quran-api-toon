quran[12]{c,v,t,f}:
  25,21,"And those who expect not a Meeting with Us (i.e. those who deny the Day of Resurrection and the life of the Hereafter) said: ""Why are not the angels sent down to us, or why do we not see our Lord?"" Indeed they think too highly of themselves, and are scornful with great pride.<sup>2</sup>","[2] (V.25:21) See the footnote of (V.22:9)."
  25,22,"On the Day they will see the angels - no glad tidings will there be for the Mujrimûn (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) that day. And they (angels) will say: ""All kinds of glad tidings are forbidden to you,"" [none will be allowed to enter Paradise except the one who said: Lâ ilâha illallâh, ""(none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh) and acted practically on its legal orders and obligations. See the footnote of V.2:193)].",""
  25,23,"And We shall turn to whatever deeds they (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust.",""
  25,24,"The dwellers of Paradise (i.e. those who deserved it through their Islamic Monotheistic Faith and their deeds of righteousness) will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.",""
  25,25,"And (remember) the Day when the heaven shall be rent asunder with clouds, and the angels will be sent down, with a grand descending.",""
  25,26,"The sovereignty on that Day will be the true (sovereignty), belonging to the Most Gracious (Allâh), and it will be a hard Day for the disbelievers (those who disbelieve in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism).",""
  25,27,"And (remember) the Day when the Zâlim (wrong-doer, oppressor, polytheist) will bite at his hands, he will say: ""Oh! Would that I had taken a path with the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم).<sup>3</sup>","[3] (V.25:27) See the footnote of (V.3:85)."
  25,28,"""Ah! Woe to me! Would that I had never taken so-and-so as a Khalîl (an intimate friend)!",""
  25,29,"""He indeed led me astray from the Reminder (this Qur’ân) after it had come to me. And Shaitân (Satan) is to man ever a deserter in the hour of need."" [Tafsir Al-Qurtubi]",""
  25,30,"And the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will say: ""O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur’ân (neither listened to it, nor acted on its laws and teachings).",""
  25,31,"Thus have We made for every Prophet an enemy among the Mujrimûn (disbelievers, polytheists, criminals). But Sufficient is your Lord as a Guide and Helper.",""
  25,32,"And those who disbelieve say: ""Why is not the Qur’ân revealed to him all at once?"" Thus (it is sent down in parts), that We may strengthen your heart thereby. And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages. (It was revealed to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم in 23 years.).",""
