quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,15,"And those of your women who commit illegal sexual intercourse, take the evidence of four witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them (i.e. women) to houses until death comes to them or Allâh ordains for them some (other) way.<sup>4</sup>","[4] (V.4:15) The provision of this Verse has been abrogated by the Verse of Sûrat An-Nûr (V.24:2), ordaining lashing for the unmarried and stoning to death for the married, when four witnesses testify to the crime."
  4,16,"And the two persons (man and woman) among you who commit illegal sexual intercourse, hurt them both.<sup>5</sup> And if they repent (promise Allâh that they will never repeat, i.e. commit illegal sexual intercourse and other similar sins) and do righteous good deeds, leave them alone. Surely, Allâh is Ever All-Forgiving (the One Who forgives and accepts repentance), (and He is) Most Merciful.","[5] (V.4:16) See (V.24:2)."
  4,17,"Allâh accepts only the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and foolishness and repent soon afterwards; it is they whom Allâh will forgive and Allâh is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.",""
  4,18,"And of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of them and he says: ""Now I repent;"" nor of those who die while they are disbelievers. For them We have prepared a painful torment.",""
  4,19,"O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will; and you should not treat them with harshness, that you may take away part of the Mahr <sup>6</sup> you have given them, unless they commit open illegal sexual intercourse; and live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allâh brings through it a great deal of good.","[6] (V.4:19) Mahr: Bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage."
