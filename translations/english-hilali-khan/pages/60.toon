quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,78,"And verily, among them is a party who distort the Book with their tongues (as they read), so that you may think it is from the Book, but it is not from the Book, and they say: ""This is from Allâh,"" but it is not from Allâh; and they speak a lie against Allâh while they know it.",""
  3,79,"It is not (possible) for any human being to whom Allâh has given the Book and Al-Hukm (the knowledge and understanding of the laws of religion) and Prophethood to say to the people: ""Be my worshippers rather than Allâh’s."" On the contrary (he would say): ""Be you Rabbâniyyûn (learned men of religion who practise what they know and also preach others), because you are teaching the Book, and you are studying it.""",""
  3,80,"Nor would he order you to take angels and Prophets for lords (gods)<sup>16</sup>. Would he order you to disbelieve after you have submitted to Allâh’s Will? (Tafsir At-Tabarî).","[16] (V.3:80) Narrated ‘Umar رضي الله عنه: I heard the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, ""Do not exaggerate in praising me as the Christians praised the son of Maryam (Mary)*, for I am only a slave. So call me the slave of Allâh and His Messenger."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No. 654).\n* The Christians overpraised ‘Îsâ (Jesus) عليه السلام till they took him as a god besides Allâh."
  3,81,"And (remember) when Allâh took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: ""Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allâh), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him."" Allâh said: ""Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?"" They said: ""We agree."" He said: ""Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this).""",""
  3,82,"Then whoever turns away after this, they are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious: those who turn away from Allâh’s Obedience).",""
  3,83,"Do they seek other than the religion of Allâh (the true Islâmic Monotheism - worshipping none but Allâh Alone), while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly. And to Him shall they all be returned.",""
