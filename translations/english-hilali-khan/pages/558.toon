quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  65,1,"O Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)! When you divorce women, divorce them at their ‘Iddah (prescribed periods) and count (accurately) their ‘Iddah (periods<sup>1</sup>). And fear Allâh your Lord (O Muslims). And turn them not out of their (husband’s) homes nor shall they (themselves) leave, except in case they are guilty of some open illegal sexual intercourse. And those are the set limits of Allâh. And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allâh, then indeed he has wronged himself. You (the one who divorces his wife) know not it may be that Allâh will afterward bring some new thing to pass (i.e. to return her back to you if that was the first or second divorce).","[1] (V.65:1) Narrated ‘Abdullâh bin ‘Umar رضي الله عنهما that he had divorced his wife while she was menstruating during the lifetime of Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم . ‘Umar bin Al-Khattâb رضي الله عنه asked Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم about that. Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Order him (your son) to take her back and keep her till she is clean from her menses and then to wait till she gets her next period and becomes clean again, whereupon, if he wishes to keep her, he can do so, and if he wishes to divorce her he can divorce her before having sexual intercourse with her; and that is the ‘Iddah (prescribed period) which Allâh has fixed for the women meant to be divorced."" (Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol.7, Hadîth No.178)."
  65,2,"Then when they are about to attain their term appointed, either take them back in a good manner or part with them in a good manner. And take as witness two just persons from among you (Muslims). And establish the testimony for Allâh. That will be an admonition given to him who believes in Allâh and the Last Day. And whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).",""
  65,3,"And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allâh, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allâh will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allâh has set a measure for all things.",""
  65,4,"And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the ‘Iddah (prescribed period), if you have doubt (about their periods), is three months; and for those who have no courses [(i.e. they are still immature) their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise, except in case of death]<sup>2</sup>. And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is until they lay down their burden; and whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him.","[2] (V.65:4) See the Our’ân, Verse 2:234."
  65,5,"That is the Command of Allâh, which He has sent down to you; and whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will expiate from him his sins, and will enlarge his reward.",""
