  39,49,"When harm touches man, he calls to Us (for help); then when We have (rescued him from that harm and) changed it into a favour from Us, he says: ""Only because of knowledge (that I possess) I obtained it."" Nay, it is only a trial, but most of them know not!",""
  39,50,"Verily, those before them said it, yet (all) that they had earned availed them not.",""
  39,51,"So, the evil results of that which they earned overtook them. And those who did wrong of these [people to whom you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) have been sent] will also be overtaken by the evil results (torment) for that which they earned; and they will never be able to escape.<sup>11</sup>","[11] (V.39:51) See the footnote of (V.5:90)."
  39,52,"Do they not know that Allâh enlarges the provision for whom He wills, and straitens it (for whom He wills). Verily, in this are signs for the folk who believe!",""
  39,53,"Say: ""O ‘Ibâdî (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allâh: verily, Allâh forgives all sins.
