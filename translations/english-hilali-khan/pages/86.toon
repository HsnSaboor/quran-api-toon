quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,45,"Allâh has full knowledge of your enemies, and Allâh is Sufficient as a Walî (Protector), and Allâh is Sufficient as a Helper.",""
  4,46,"Among those who are Jews, there are some who displace words from (their) right places and say: ""We hear your word (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and disobey,"" and ""Hear and let you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) hear nothing."" And Râ‘ina <sup>15</sup> with a twist of their tongues and as a mockery of the religion (Islâm). And if only they had said: ""We hear and obey"", and ""Do make us understand,"" it would have been better for them, and more proper; but Allâh has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not except a few.","[15] (V.4:46) Râ‘inâ means in Arabic ""Be careful, listen to us, and we listen to you"", whereas in Hebrew, it means an insult."
  4,47,"O you who have been given the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Believe in what We have revealed (to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) confirming what is (already) with you, before We efface faces (by making them like the back of necks; without nose, mouth) and turn them hindwards, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers<sup>16</sup>. And the Commandment of Allâh is always executed.<sup>17</sup>","[16] (V.4:47) This Verse is a severe warning to the Jews and Christians, and an absolute obligation that they must believe in Allâh’s Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلمand in his Message of Islâmic Monotheism and in this Qur’ân.\n[17] (V.4:47) See the footnote of the (V.3:85), and see (V.3:116), (V.8:39 and its footnote)."
  4,48,"Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills; and whoever sets up partners with Allâh in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin.<sup>18</sup>","[18] (V.4:48) Narrated Anas :رضي الله عنه The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Allâh will say to that person of the (Hell) Fire who will receive the least punishment, ‘If you had everything on the earth, would you give it as a ransom to free yourself (i.e. save yourself from this Fire)?’ He will say, `Yes’. Then Allâh will say, `While you were in the backbone of Adam, I asked you much less than this, (i.e. not to worship others besides Me), but you insisted on worshipping others besides me.’"" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 4, Hadîth No 551)."
  4,49,"Have you not seen those (Jews and Christians)<sup>19</sup> who claim sanctity for themselves. Nay, but Allâh sanctifies whom He wills, and they will not be dealt with injustice even equal to the extent of a scalish thread in the long slit of a date-stone.","[19] (V.4:49) See Tafseer Ibn Kathîr"
  4,50,"Look, how they invent a lie against Allâh, and enough is that as a manifest sin.",""
  4,51,"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They believe in Jibt and Tâghût <sup>20</sup> and say to the disbelievers that they are better guided as regards the way than the believers (Muslims).","[20] (V.4:51) The words ""Jibt and Tâghût"" cover wide meanings: They mean anything worshipped other than the Real God (Allâh) i.e. all the false deities, it may be an idol, satan, graves, stone, sun, star, angel, saints or any human being. [Please see Tafsir Ibn Kathir and the footnote of (V.2:256)]."
