quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,164,"Verily! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, and the ships which sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind, and the water (rain) which Allâh sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive therewith after its death, and the moving (living) creatures of all kinds that He has scattered therein, and in the veering of winds and clouds which are held between the sky and the earth, are indeed Ayât (proofs, evidence, signs, etc.) for people of understanding.",""
  2,165,"And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allâh as rivals<sup>33</sup> (to Allâh). They love them as they love Allâh. But those who believe, love Allâh more (than anything else). If only, those who do wrong could see, when they will see the torment, that all power belongs to Allâh and that Allâh is Severe in punishment.","[33] (V.2:165) Narrated ‘Abdullâh رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said one statement and I said another. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""Whoever dies while still invoking anything other than Allâh as a rival to Allâh, will enter Hell (Fire)."" And I said, ""Whoever dies without invoking anything as a rival to Allâh, will enter Paradise"". (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.6, Hadîth No.24)."
  2,166,"When those who were followed, disown (declare themselves innocent of) those who followed (them), and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them.",""
  2,167,"And those who followed will say: ""If only we had one more chance to return (to the worldly life), we would disown (declare ourselves as innocent from) them as they have disowned (declared themselves as innocent from) us."" Thus Allâh will show them their deeds as regrets for them. And they will never get out of the Fire.",""
  2,168,"O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth, and follow not the footsteps of Shaitan (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open enemy.",""
  2,169,"He [Shaitân (Satan)] commands you only what is evil and Fahshâ (sinful), and that you should say against Allâh what you know not.",""
