  6,12,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth?"" Say: ""To Allâh. He has prescribed Mercy for Himself.<sup>2</sup> Indeed He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt. Those who have lost themselves will not believe [in Allâh as being the only Ilâh (God), and Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم as being one of His Messengers, and in Resurrection].","[2] (V.6:12)\nA) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, ""Allâh has divided Mercy into one hundred parts, and He kept ninety-nine parts with Him and sent down one part to the earth, and because of that one single part, His creatures are merciful to each other, so that even the mare lifts up its hoof away from its baby animal, lest it should trample on it."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.8, Hadîth No.29).\nB) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""When Allâh completed the creation, He wrote in His Book which is with Him on His Throne: ‘Verily, My Mercy has overcome My Anger.’ "" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No.416)."

  6,15,"Say: ""I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the torment of a Mighty Day.""",""
