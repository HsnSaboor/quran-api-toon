  2,77,"Know they (Jews) not that Allâh knows what they conceal and what they reveal?",""
  2,78,"And there are among them (Jews) unlettered people, who know not the Book, but they trust upon false desires and they but guess.",""
  2,79,"Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then say, ""This is from Allâh,"" to purchase with it a little price! Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for that they earn thereby.",""
  2,80,"And they (Jews) say, ""The Fire (i.e. Hell-fire on the Day of Resurrection) shall not touch us but for a few numbered days."" Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to them): ""Have you taken a covenant from Allâh, so that Allâh will not break His Covenant? Or is it that you say of Allâh what you know not?""",""
  2,81,"Yes! Whosoever earns evil and his sin has surrounded him, they are dwellers of the Fire (i.e. Hell); they will dwell therein forever.",""
  2,82,"And those who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh تعالى - Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, they are dwellers of Paradise, they will dwell therein forever. (See V. 2:257)",""
  2,83,"And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, (saying): Worship none but Allâh (Alone) and be dutiful and good to parents, and to kindred, and to orphans and Al-Masâkîn <sup>18</sup> (the poor), and speak good to people [i.e. enjoin righteousness and forbid evil, and say the truth about Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم], and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât. Then you slid back, except a few of you, while you are backsliders. (Tafsir Al-Qurtubî).","[18] (V.2:83) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, "" Al-Miskîn (the poor) is not the one who goes round the people and ask them for a mouthful or two (of meals) or a date or two, but Al-Miskîn (the poor) is that who has not enough (money) to satisfy his needs and whose condition is not known to other, that others may give him something in charity, and who does not beg of people."", (Sahih Al-Bukhâri Vol.2 Hadith No. 557.
