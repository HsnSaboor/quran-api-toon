  17,28,"And if you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) turn away from them (kindred, poor, wayfarer whom We have ordered you to give their rights, but if you have no money at the time they ask you for it) and you are awaiting a mercy from your Lord for which you hope, then, speak unto them a soft kind word (i.e. Allâh will give me and I shall give you).",""
  17,29,"And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.",""
  17,30,"Truly, your Lord enlarges the provision for whom He wills and straitens (for whom He wills). Verily, He is Ever All-Knower, All-Seer of His slaves.",""
  17,31,"And kill not your children for fear of poverty. We shall provide for them as well as for you. Surely, the killing of them is a great sin.",""
  17,32,"And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Fâhishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin), and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allâh forgives him).",""
  17,33,"And do not kill anyone whose killing Allâh has forbidden, except for a just cause. And whoever is killed wrongfully (Mazlûman intentionally with hostility and oppression and not by mistake), We have given his heir the authority [to demand Qisâs, - Law of Equality in punishment - or to forgive, or to take Diyah (blood money)]. But let him not exceed limits in the matter of taking life (i.e he should not kill except the killer). Verily, he is helped (by the Islâmic law).<sup>6</sup>","[6] (V.17:33):\na) See the footnote of (V.2:22).\nb) See the footnote of (V.5:50)."

  17,36,"And follow not (O man i.e., say not, or do not or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge.<sup>7</sup> Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those one will be questioned (by Allâh).","[7] (V.17:36) e.g. one’s saying: ""I have seen,"" while in fact he has not seen, or ""I have heard,"" while he has not heard."
  17,37,"And walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance. Verily, you can neither rend nor penetrate the earth, nor can you attain a stature like the mountains in height.",""
  17,38,"All the bad aspects of these (the above mentioned things) are hateful to your Lord.",""
