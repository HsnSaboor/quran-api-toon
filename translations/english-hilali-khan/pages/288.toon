quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  17,59,"And nothing stops Us from sending the Ayât (proofs, evidence, signs) but that the people of old denied them. And We sent the she-camel to Thamûd as a clear sign, but they did her wrong. And We sent not the signs except to warn, and to make them afraid (of destruction).",""
  17,60,"And (remember) when We told you: ""Verily! Your Lord has encompassed mankind (i.e. they are in His Grip)."" And We made not the vision which we showed you (O Muhammad as an actual eye-witness and not as a dream on the night of Al-Isrâ’<sup>10</sup>) but a trial for mankind, and (likewise) the accursed tree (Zaqqûm, mentioned) in the Qur’ân. We warn and make them afraid but it only increases them in naught save great disbelief, oppression and disobedience to Allâh.","[10] (V.17:60) See footnote of (V.53:12) Al-Mi‘râj"
  17,61,"And (remember) when We said to the angels: ""Prostrate yourselves unto Adam."" They prostrated themselves except Iblîs (Satan). He said: ""Shall I prostrate myself to one whom You created from clay?""",""
  17,62,"[Iblîs (Satan)] said: ""See this one whom You have honoured above me, if You give me respite (keep me alive) to the Day of Resurrection, I will surely seize and mislead his offspring (by sending them astray) all but a few!""",""
  17,63,"(Allâh) said: ""Go, and whosoever of them follows you, surely Hell will be the recompense of you (all) - an ample recompense.",""
  17,64,"""And befool them gradually those whom you can among them with your voice (i.e. songs, music, and any other call for Allâh’s disobedience), make assaults on them with your cavalry and your infantry, share with them wealth and children (by tempting them to earn money by illegal ways - usury, or by committing illegal sexual intercourse), and make promises to them."" But Satan promises them nothing but deceit.",""
  17,65,"""Verily, My slaves (i.e. the true believers of Islâmic Monotheism) - you have no authority over them. And All-Sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.""",""
  17,66,"Your Lord is He Who drives the ship for you through the sea, in order that you may seek of His Bounty. Truly He is Ever Most Merciful towards you.",""
