  29,31,"And when Our Messengers came to Ibrâhîm (Abraham) with the glad tidings they said: ""Verily, we are going to destroy the people of this [Lût (Lot’s)] town (i.e. the town of Sodom in Palestine); truly, its people have been Zâlimûn [wrong-doers, polytheists disobedient to Allâh, and who belied their Messenger Lût (Lot)].""",""
  29,32,"Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said: ""But there is Lût (Lot) in it."" They said: ""We know better who is there. We will verily save him [Lût (Lot)] and his family except his wife: she will be of those who remain behind (i.e. she will be destroyed along with those who will be destroyed from her folk).""",""
  29,33,"And when Our Messengers came to Lût (Lot), he was grieved because of them, and felt straitened on their account. They said: ""Have no fear, and do not grieve! Truly, we shall save you and your family, except your wife: she will be of those who remain behind (i.e. she will be destroyed along with those who will be destroyed from her folk).",""
  29,34,"""Verily, we are about to bring down on the people of this town a great torment from the sky, because they have been rebellious (against Allâh’s Command).""",""
  29,35,"And indeed We have left thereof an evident Ayâh (a lesson and a warning and a sign - the place where the Dead Sea is now in Palestine)<sup>6</sup> for a folk who understand.","[6] (V.29:35) See the book of history كتاب التاريخ لابن كثير ""Stories of the Prophets"" by Ibn Kathir (رحمه الله)."
  29,36,"And to (the people of) Madyan (Midian), We sent their brother Shu‘aib. He said: ""O my people! Worship Allâh (Alone) and hope for (the reward of good deeds by worshipping Allâh Alone, on) the last Day (i.e. the Day of Resurrection), and commit no mischief on the earth as Mufsidûn (those who commit great crimes, oppressors, tyrants, mischief-makers, corrupters). [Tafsir At-Tabari]",""
  29,37,"And they belied him [Shu‘aib]: so the earthquake seized them, and they lay (dead), prostrate in their dwellings.",""
  29,38,"And ‘Âd and Thamûd (people)! And indeed (their destruction) is clearly apparent to you from their (ruined) dwellings. Shaitân (Satan) made their deeds fair-seeming to them, and turned them away from the (Right) Path, though they were intelligent.",""
