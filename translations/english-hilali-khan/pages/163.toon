  7,96,"And if the people of the towns had believed and had the Taqwâ (piety), certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth, but they belied (the Messengers). So We took them (with punishment) for what they used to earn (polytheism and crimes).",""
  7,97,"Did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment by night while they were asleep?",""
  7,98,"Or, did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment in the forenoon while they were playing?",""
  7,99,"Did they then feel secure against the Plan of Allâh? None feels secure from the Plan of Allâh except the people who are the losers.",""
  7,100,"Is it not clear to those who inherit the earth in succession from its (previous) possessors, that had We willed, We would have punished them for their sins. And We seal up their hearts so that they hear not?",""
  7,101,"Those were the towns whose story We relate unto you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم). And there came indeed to them their Messengers with clear proofs, but they were not such as to believe in that which they had rejected before. Thus Allâh does seal up the hearts of the disbelievers (from every kind of religious guidance).",""
  7,102,"And most of them We found not true to their covenant, but most of them We found indeed Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh).",""
  7,103,"Then after them We sent Mûsâ (Moses) with Our Signs to Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them. So see how was the end of the Mufsidûn (mischief-makers, corrupters).",""
  7,104,"And Mûsâ (Moses) said: ""O Fir‘aun (Pharaoh)! Verily, I am a Messenger from the Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists).",""
