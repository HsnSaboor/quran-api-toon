quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  8,70,"O Prophet (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) Say to the captives that are in your hands! ""If Allâh knows any good in your hearts, He will give you something better than what has been taken from you, and He will forgive you, and Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.""",""
  8,71,"But if they intend to betray you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), they indeed betrayed Allâh before. So He gave (you) power over them. And Allâh is All-Knower, All-Wise.",""
  8,72,"Verily, those who believed, and emigrated and strove hard and fought with their property and their lives in the Cause of Allâh as well as those who gave (them) asylum and help, - these are (all) allies to one another. And as to those who believed but did not emigrate (to you O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), you owe no duty of protection to them until they emigrate<sup>7</sup>; but if they seek your help in religion, it is your duty to help them except against a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance; and Allâh is the All-Seer of what you do.","[7] (V.8:72): See the footnote of (V.3:149)."
  8,73,"And those who disbelieve are allies of one another, (and) if you (Muslims of the whole world collectively) do not do so [i.e. become allies, as one united block under one Khalifah (a chief Muslim ruler for the whole Muslim world) to make victorious Allâh’s religion of Islâmic Monotheism], there will be Fitnah (wars, battles, polytheism) and oppression on the earth, and a great mischief and corruption (appearance of polytheism).<sup>8</sup>","[8] (V.8:73) It has been mentioned in Tafsjr At-Tabari, that the best interpretation of this Verse: - [""And those who disbelieve are allies of one another, (and) if you (Muslims of the whole world collectively) do not do so (i.e. become allies, as one united block V.8:73).""] is ""That if you do not do what We (Allâh) have ordered you to do, [i.e. all of you (Muslims of the whole world) do not become allies as one united block to make Allâh’s religion Islâm) victorious, there will be a great Fitnah (polytheism, wars, battles, killing, robbing, a great mischief, corruption and oppression.)""]. And it is Fitnah to have many Khalifahs (Muslim rulers), as it has been mentioned in Sahih Muslim by ‘Arfajah, who said: I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying: ""When you all (Muslims) are united (as one block) under a single Khalifah (chief Muslim ruler), and a man comes up to disintegrate you and separate you into different groups, then kill that man.""\nAlso there is another narration in Sahih Muslim: Narrated Abu Sa‘îd Al-Khudrî رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلمsaid: ""If the Muslim world gave the Bai‘a (pledge) to two Khalifah (chief Muslim rulers), the first one who was given the Bai‘a (pledge) first will remain as the Khalifah, then kill the latter (the second) one."" So it is a legal obligation, from the above-mentioned evident proofs (from the Qur’ân and the Prophet’s statement), that there shall not be more than one Khalifah (a chief Muslim ruler) for the whole Muslim world or otherwise there will be a great Fitnah (mischief and evil) amongst the Muslims, the ultimate results of which will not be worthy of praise."
  8,74,"And those who believed, and emigrated and strove hard in the Cause of Allâh (Al-Jihâd), as well as those who gave (them) asylum and aid - these are the believers in truth, for them is forgiveness and Rizqun Karîm (a generous provision i.e. Paradise).",""
  8,75,"And those who believed afterwards, and emigrated and strove hard along with you (in the Cause of Allâh), they are of you. But kindred by blood are nearer to one another (regarding inheritance) in the decree ordained by Allâh. Verily, Allâh is the All-Knower of everything.",""
