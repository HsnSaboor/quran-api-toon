  6,19,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""What thing is the most great in witness?"" Say: ""Allâh (the Most Great!) is Witness between me and you; this Qur’ân has been revealed to me that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach. Can you verily bear witness that besides Allâh there are other âlihah (gods)?"" Say ""I bear no (such) witness!"" Say: ""But in truth He (Allâh) is the only one Ilâh (God). And truly I am innocent of what you join in worship with Him.""",""
  6,20,"Those to whom We have given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) recognize him (i.e. Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم as a Messenger of Allâh, and they also know that there is no Ilâh (God) but Allâh and Islâm is Allâh’s Religion), as they recognize their own sons. Those who have lost (destroyed) themselves will not believe.<sup>3</sup> (Tafsir At-Tabarî).","[3] (V.6:20) See the footnote of (V.3:85)."
  6,21,"And who does more aggression and wrong than he who invents a lie against Allâh or rejects His Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons or revelations)? Verily, the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) shall never be successful.",""
  6,22,"And on the Day when We shall gather them all together, then We shall say to those who joined partners (in worship with Us): ""Where are your partners (false deities) whom you used to assert (as partners in worship with Allâh)?""",""
  6,23,"There will then be (left) no Fitnah (excuses or statements or arguments) for them but to say: ""By Allâh, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allâh.""",""
  6,24,"Look! How they lie against themselves! But the (lie) which they invented will disappear from them.",""
  6,25,"And of them there are some who listen to you; but We have set veils on their hearts, so they understand it not, and deafness in their ears; and even if they see every one of the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) they will not believe therein; to the point that when they come to you to argue with you, the disbelievers say: ""These are nothing but tales of the men of old.""",""
  6,26,"And they prevent others from him (from following Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and they themselves keep away from him, and (by doing so) they destroy not but their ownselves, yet they perceive (it) not.",""
  6,27,"If you could but see when they will be held over the (Hell) Fire! They will say: ""Would that we were but sent back (to the world)! Then we would not deny the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, revelations, etc.) of our Lord, and we would be of the believers!""",""
