  16,80,"And Allâh has made for you in your homes an abode, and made for you out of the hides of the cattle (tents for) dwelling, which you find so light (and handy) when you travel and when you stay (in your travels); and of their wool, fur, and hair (sheep wool, camel fur, and goat hair), furnishings and articles of convenience (e.g. carpets, blankets), comfort for a while.",""
  16,81,"And Allâh has made for you out of that which He has created shades, and has made for you places of refuge in the mountains, and has made for you garments to protect you from the heat (and cold), and coats of mail to protect you from your (mutual) violence. Thus does He perfect His Favour unto you, that you may submit yourselves to His Will (in Islâm).",""
  16,82,"Then, if they turn away, your duty (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) is only to convey (the Message) in a clear way.",""
  16,83,"They recognise the Grace of Allâh, yet they deny it (by worshipping others besides Allâh) and most of them are disbelievers (deny the Prophethood of Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم).",""
  16,84,"And (remember) the Day when We shall raise up from each nation a witness (their Messenger), then, those who disbelieved will not be given leave (to put forward excuses), nor will they be allowed (to return to the world) to repent and ask for Allâh’s Forgiveness (of their sins).",""
  16,85,"And when those who did wrong (the disbelievers) will see the torment, then it will not be lightened unto them, nor will they be given respite.",""
  16,86,"And when those who associated partners with Allâh see their (Allâh’s so-called) partners, they will say: ""Our Lord! These are our partners whom we used to invoke besides you."" But they will throw back their word at them (and say): ""Surely! You indeed are liars!""",""
  16,87,"And they will offer (their full) submission to Allâh (Alone) on that Day, and their invented false deities [all that they used to invoke besides Allâh, e.g. idols, saints, priests, monks, angels, jinn, Jibrîl (Gabriel), Messengers] will vanish from them.",""
