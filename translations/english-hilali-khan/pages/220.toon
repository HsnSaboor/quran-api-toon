  10,98,"Was there any town (community) that believed (after seeing the punishment), and its Faith (at that moment) saved it (from the punishment)?

  10,99,"And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) then compel mankind, until they become believers.",""
  10,100,"It is not for any person to believe, except by the Leave of Allâh, and He will put the wrath on those who are heedless.",""

  10,105,"""And (it is revealed to me): Direct your face (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) entirely towards the religion Hanîf (Islâmic Monotheism, i.e. to worship none but Allâh Alone), and never be one of the Mushrikûn (those who ascribe partners to Allâh, polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh, and those who worship others along with Allâh).",""
  10,106,"""And invoke not besides Allâh, any such that will neither profit you nor harm you, but if (in case) you did so, you shall certainly be one of the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).<sup>14</sup>""","[14] (V.10:106) See the footnote of (V.2:165)."
