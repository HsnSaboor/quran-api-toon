  3,133,"And march forth in the way (which leads to) forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2).",""
  3,134,"Those who spend (in Allâh’s Cause) in prosperity and in adversity<sup>25</sup>, who repress anger<sup>26</sup>, and who pardon men; verily, Allâh loves Al-Muhsinûn <sup>27</sup> (the good-doers).","[25] (V.3:134) Narrated Abu Hurairahرضي الله عنه : The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, ""Charity is obligatory everyday on every joint of a human being"".* If one helps a person in matters concerning his riding animal by helping him to ride on it or by lifting his luggage on to it, all this will be regarded as charity. A good word, and every step one takes to offer the compulsory congregational prayer is regarded as charity; and guiding somebody on the road is regarded as charity."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No.141).\n* To show gratitude to Allâh for keeping your body safe and sound, you should give in charity or do charitable deeds. \n[26] (V.3:134) Narrated Abu Hurairahرضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger(صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, ""The strong is not the one who overcomes the people by his strength, but the strong is the one who controls himself while in anger."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.8, Hadîth No.135).\n[27] (V.3:134) Al-Muhsinûn: Doers of good, those who perform good deeds totally for Allâh’s sake only without any show-off or to gain praise or fame and they do them in accordance with the Sunnah (legal ways) of Allâh’s Messenger, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم)."
  3,135,"And those who, when they have committed Fâhishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allâh and ask forgiveness for their sins; - and none can forgive sins but Allâh - and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know.<sup>28</sup>","[28] (V.3:135) See the footnote of (V.42:25)."
  3,136,"For such, the reward is Forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath (Paradise), wherein they shall abide forever. How excellent is this reward for the doers (who do righteous deeds according to Allâh’s Orders).",""
  3,137,"Many similar ways (and mishaps of life) were faced by nations (believers and disbelievers) that have passed away before you (as you have faced in the battle of Uhud), so travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who disbelieved (in the Oneness of Allâh, and disobeyed Him and His Messengers).",""
  3,138,"This (the Qur’ân) is a plain statement for mankind, a guidance and instruction to those who are Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2).",""
  3,139,"So do not become weak (against your enemy), nor be sad, and you will be superior (in victory) if you are indeed (true) believers.",""
  3,140,"If a wound (and killing) has touched you, be sure a similar wound (and killing) has touched the others. And so are the days (good and not so good), We give to men by turns, that Allâh may test those who believe, and that He may take martyrs from among you. And Allâh likes not the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).",""
