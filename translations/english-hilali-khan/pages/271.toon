quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  16,35,"And those who joined others in worship with Allâh said: ""If Allâh had so willed, neither we nor our fathers would have worshipped aught but Him, nor would we have forbidden anything without (Command from) Him."" So did those before them. Then! Are the Messengers charged with anything but to convey clearly the Message?",""
  16,36,"And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): ""Worship Allâh (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Tâghût<sup>12</sup> (all false deities i.e. do not worship Tâghût besides Allâh)."" Then of them were some whom Allâh guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied (the truth).","[12] (V.16:36) Tâghut: See the footnote of (V.2:256)."
  16,37,"If you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) covet for their guidance,<sup>13</sup> then verily Allâh guides not those whom He makes to go astray (or none can guide him whom Allâh sends astray). And they will have no helpers.","[13] (V.16:37) Narrated Abû Hurairah رضي الله عنه: I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, ""My example and the example of the people is that of a man who made a fire, and when it lighted what was around it, moths and other insects started falling into the fire. The man tried (his best) to prevent them, (from falling in the fire) but they overpowered him and rushed into the fire."" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added; ""Now, similarly, I take hold of the knots at your waist (belts) to prevent you from falling into the fire, but you insist on falling into it.""* (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.490).\n* The fire symbolizes the unlawful deeds which the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم warned the people of."
  16,38,"And they swear by Allâh their strongest oaths, that Allâh will not raise up him who dies. Yes, (He will raise them up), - a promise (binding) upon Him in truth, but most of mankind know not.",""
  16,39,"In order that He may make manifest to them the truth of that wherein they differ, and that those who disbelieved (in Resurrection, and in the Oneness of Allâh) may know that they were liars.",""
  16,40,"Verily! Our Word unto a thing when We intend it, is only that We say unto it: ""Be!"" - and it is.<sup>14</sup>","[14] (V.16:40) See the footnote of (V.51:30)"
  16,41,"And as for those who emigrated for the Cause of Allâh, after they had been wronged, We will certainly give them goodly residence in this world, but indeed the reward of the Hereafter will be greater; if they but knew!",""
  16,42,"(They are) those who remained patient (in this world for Allâh’s sake), and put their trust in their Lord (Allâh Alone).",""
