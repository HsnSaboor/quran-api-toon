quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  14,11,"Their Messengers said to them: ""We are no more than human beings like you, but Allâh bestows His Grace to whom He wills of His slaves. It is not ours to bring you an authority (proof) except by the Permission of Allâh. And in Allâh (Alone) let the believers put their trust.",""
  14,12,"""And why should we not put our trust in Allâh while He indeed has guided us our ways? And we shall certainly bear with patience all the hurt you may cause us, and in Allâh (Alone) let those who trust, put their trust.""",""
  14,13,"And those who disbelieved, said to their Messengers: ""Surely, we shall drive you out of our land, or you shall return to our religion."" So their Lord revealed to them: ""Truly, We shall destroy the Zâlimûn (polytheists, disbelievers and wrong-doers).",""
  14,14,"""And indeed, We shall make you dwell in the land after them. This is for him who fears standing before Me (on the Day of Resurrection or fears My punishment) and also fears My threat.""",""
  14,15,"And they (the Messengers) sought victory and help [from their Lord (Allâh)]; and every obstinate, arrogant dictator (who refuses to believe in the Oneness of Allâh) was brought to a complete loss and destruction.",""
  14,16,"In front of him (every obstinate, arrogant dictator) is Hell, and he will be made to drink boiling, festering water.",""
  14,17,"He will sip it unwillingly, and he will find a great difficulty to swallow it down his throat<sup>1</sup>; and death will come to him from every side, yet he will not die and in front of him, will be a great torment.","[1] (V.14:17) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""The width between the two shoulders of a Kâfir (disbeliever) will be equal to the distance covered by a fast rider in three days."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.559A)"
  14,18,"The parable of those who disbelieved in their Lord is that their works are as ashes, on which the wind blows furiously on a stormy day; they shall not be able to get aught of what they have earned. That is the straying, far away (from the Right Path).",""
