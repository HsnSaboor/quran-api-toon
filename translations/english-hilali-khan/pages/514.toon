quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  48,24,"And He it is Who has withheld their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makkah, after He had made you victors over them. And Allâh is Ever the All-Seer of what you do.",""
  48,25,"They are the ones who disbelieved (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) and hindered you from Al-Masjid-al-Harâm (at Makkah) and detained the sacrificial animals from reaching their place of sacrifice. Had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not know, that you may kill them and on whose account a sin would have been committed by you without (your) knowledge, that Allâh might bring into His Mercy whom He wills - if they (the believers and the disbelievers) had been apart, We verily would have punished those of them who disbelieved with painful torment.",""
  48,26,"When those who disbelieve had put in their hearts pride and haughtiness - the pride and haughtiness of the time of ignorance, - then Allâh sent down His Sakînah (calmness and tranquillity) upon His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and upon the believers, and made them stick to the word of piety (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh); and they were well entitled to it and worthy of it. And Allâh is the All-Knower of everything.",""
  48,27,"Indeed Allâh shall fulfil the true vision which He showed to His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) [i.e. the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم saw a dream that he has entered Makkah along with his Companions, having their (head) hair shaved and cut short] in very truth. Certainly, you shall enter Al-Masjid-al-Harâm, if Allâh wills, secure, (some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short, having no fear. He knew what you knew not, and He granted besides that a near victory.",""
  48,28,"He it is Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islâm), that He may make it (Islâm) superior to all religions. And All-Sufficient is Allâh as a Witness.",""
