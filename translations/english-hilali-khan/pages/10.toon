  2,62,"Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians,<sup>15</sup> whoever believes in Allâh and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.<sup>16</sup>","[15] (V.2:62) A past nation used to live in Mûsal (Iraq) and say Lâ ilâha illallâh (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh) and used to read Az-Zabur (the Psalms of the Sabians) and they were neither Jews nor Christians.\n[16] (V.2:62) This Verse (and Verse 5:69), mentioned in the Qur’ân should not be misinterpreted by the reader as mentioned by Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما (Tafsîr At-Tabari) that the provision of this Verse was abrogated by the Verse 3:85: ""And whosoever seeks a religion other than Islâm, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter, he will be one of the losers."" (i.e. after the coming of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم on the earth, no other religion except Islâm, will be accepted from anyone)."
  2,63,"And (O Children of Israel, remember) when We took your covenant and We raised above you the Mount (saying): ""Hold fast to that which We have given you, and remember that which is therein so that you may become Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2).",""
  2,64,"Then after that you turned away. Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of Allâh upon you, indeed you would have been among the losers.",""
  2,65,"And indeed you knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday). We said to them: ""Be you monkeys, despised and rejected.""",""
  2,66,"So We made this punishment an example to their own and to succeeding generations and a lesson to those who are Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2).",""
  2,67,"And (remember) when Mûsâ (Moses) said to his people: ""Verily, Allâh commands you that you slaughter a cow."" They said, ""Do you make fun of us?"" He said, ""I take Allâh’s Refuge from being among Al-Jâhilûn (the ignorant or the foolish).""",""
  2,68,"They said, ""Call upon your Lord for us that He may make plain to us what it is!"" He said, ""He says, ‘Verily, it is a cow neither too old nor too young, but (it is) between the two conditions’, so do what you are commanded.""",""
  2,69,"They said, ""Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us its colour."" He said, ""He says, ‘It is a yellow cow, bright in its colour, pleasing to the beholders.’ """,""
