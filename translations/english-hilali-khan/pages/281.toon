  16,119,"Then, verily! Your Lord - for those who do evil (commit sins and are disobedient to Allâh) in ignorance and afterward repent and do righteous deeds, verily, your Lord thereafter, (to such) is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",""
  16,120,"Verily, Ibrâhîm (Abraham) was an Ummah (a leader having all the good righteous qualities), or a nation, obedient to Allâh, Hanîf (i.e. to worship none but Allâh), and he was not one of those who were Al-Mushrikûn (polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh, and those who joined partners with Allâh).",""
  16,121,"(He was) thankful for His (Allâh’s) Favours. He (Allâh) chose him (as an intimate friend) and guided him to a Straight Path (Islâmic Monotheism - neither Judaism nor Christianity<sup>24</sup>).","[24] (V.16:121) (A) Ibrâhîim (Abraham) was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanîf (Islâmic Monotheism - to worship none but Allâh Alone) and he joined none in worship with Allâh. [The Qur’an, Verse 3: 67]\n(B) See the footnote (B) of (V.16:71).\n(C) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Ibrâhîm (Abraham) عليه السلام did not tell a lie except on three occasions. Twice for the sake of Allâh عز وجل when he said, ""I am sick,"" and he said, ""(I have not done this but) the big idol has done it.""* The (third was) that while Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and Sârah (his wife) were going (on a journey) they passed by (the territory of) a tyrant from among the tyrants. Someone said to the tyrant, ""This man (i.e. Ibrâhîm (Abraham) عليه السلام) is accompanied by a very charming lady."" So, he sent for Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and asked him about Sârah saying, ""Who is this lady?"" Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said, ""She is my sister."" Ibrâhîm (Abraham) went to Sârah and said, ‘O Sârah! There are no believers on the surface of the earth except you and I. This man asked me about you and I have told him that you are my sister, so don’t contradict my statement."" The tyrant then called Sârah and when she went to him, he tried to take hold of her with his hand, but (his hand got stiff and) he was confounded. He asked Sârah, ""Pray to Allâh for me, and I shall not harm you."" So Sârah asked Allâh to cure him and he got cured. He tried to take hold of her for the second time, but (his hand got as stiff as or stiffer than before and) was more confounded. He again requested Sârah, ""Pray to Allâh for me, and I will not harm you,"" Sârah asked Allâh again and he became right. He then called one of his guards (who had brought her) and said, ""You have not brought me a human being but have brought me a devil."" The tyrant then gave Hâjar as a girl-servant to Sârah. Sârah came back [to Ibrâhîm (Abraham)] while he was praying. Ibrâhîm (Abraham), gesturing with his hand, asked, ""What has happened?"" She replied ""Allâh has spoiled the evil plot of the infidel (or immoral person) and gave me Hâjar for service"". (Abu Hurairah then addressed his listeners saying, ""That (Hâjar) was your mother, O Banî Mâ’-is-Samâ’ (i.e. the Arabs)."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.4, Hadith No.578)\n* The idolaters invited Ibrâhîm (Abraham) to join them in their celebrations outside the city, but he refused, claiming that he was sick. When he was left alone, he came to their idols and broke them into pieces. When the idolaters questioned him, he claimed that he had not destroyed their idols but the chief idol had, which Ibrâhîm (Abraham) left undisturbed and on whose shoulder he had put an axe to lay the accusation on it."
  16,122,"And We gave him good in this world, and in the Hereafter he shall be of the righteous.",""
  16,123,"Then, We have sent the revelation to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم saying): ""Follow the religion of Ibrâhîm (Abraham) Hanif (Islâmic Monotheism<sup>25</sup> - to worship none but Allâh) and he was not of the Mushrikûn (polytheists, idolaters and disbelievers).","[25] (V.16:123) See the footnote of (V.2:135)."
  16,124,"The Sabbath was only prescribed for those who differed concerning it, and verily, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they used to differ.",""
  16,125,"Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better. Truly, your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His Path, and He is the Best Aware of those who are guided.",""
  16,126,"And if you punish (your enemy, O you believers in the Oneness of Allâh), then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted. But if you endure patiently, verily, it is better for As-Sâbirûn (the patient).<sup>26</sup>","[26] (V.16:126)\na) The Statement of Allâh: ""Only those who are patient shall receive their rewards in full, without reckoning"" (V.39:10)\nNarrated Abu Mûsâ رضي الله عنه : The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""None is more patient than Allâh against the harmful saying He hears from the people, they ascribe a son (or offspring) to Him, yet He gives them health and (supplies them with) provision."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.121)\nb) Narrated ‘Abdullâh رضي الله عنه: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم divided and distributed something as he used to do with some of his distributions. A man from the Ansâr said, ""By Allâh! in this division the pleasure of Allâh has not been intended."" I said, ""I will definitely tell this to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. "" So I went to him while he was sitting with his companions and told him of it secretly. That was hard upon the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and the colour of his face changed, and he became so angry that I wished I had not told him. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم then said, ""Mûsâ (Moses) was harmed with more than this, yet he remained patient."" (Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.122)"
  16,127,"And endure you patiently (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم), your patience is not but from Allâh. And grieve not over them (polytheists and pagans), and be not distressed because of what they plot.",""
  16,128,"Truly, Allâh is with those who fear Him (keep their duty unto Him),<sup>27</sup> and those who are Muhsinûn (good-doers. See the footenote of V.9:120).","[27] (V.16:128) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""The deeds of anyone of you will not save you [from the (Hell) Fire]."" They said, ""Even you (will not be saved by your deeds), O Allâh’s Messenger?"" He said, ""No, even I (will not be saved) unless and until Allâh bestows His Mercy on me and protects me with His Grace. Therefore, do good deeds properly, sincerely and moderately, and worship Allâh in the forenoon and in the afternoon and during a part of the night, and always adopt a middle, moderate, regular course whereby you will reach your target (Paradise).""
