quran[10]{c,v,t,f}:
  45,23,"Have you seen him who takes his own lust (vain desires) as his ilâh (god)? And Allâh knowing (him as such), left him astray, and sealed his hearing and his heart, and put a cover on his sight. Who then will guide him after Allâh? Will you not then remember?",""
  45,24,"And they say: ""There is nothing but our life of this world, we die and we live and nothing destroys us except Ad-Dahr (time).<sup>4</sup> And they have no knowledge of it: they only conjecture.","[4] (V.45:24) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ""Allâh said, ‘The son of Adam annoys Me for he abuses Ad-Dahr* (Time) though I am Ad-Dahr (Time); in My Hands are all things, and I cause the revolution of day and night.’ "" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadîth No.351).\n* ‘I am Ad-Dahr’ means ‘I am the Creator of Time, and I manage the affairs of all creation including Time.’ One should not attribute anything whether cheerful or disastrous to Time, for everything is in the Hands of Allâh and only He is the Disposer of everything."
  45,25,"And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, their argument is no other than that they say: ""Bring back our (dead) fathers, if you are truthful!""",""
  45,26,"Say (to them): ""Allâh gives you life, then causes you to die, then He will assemble you on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt. But most of mankind know not.""",""
  45,27,"And to Allâh belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And on the Day that the Hour will be established - on that Day the followers of falsehood (polytheists, disbelievers, worshippers of false deities) shall lose (everything).",""
  45,28,"And you will see each nation humbled to their knees (kneeling): each nation will be called to its Record (of deeds). This Day you shall be recompensed for what you used to do.",""
  45,29,"This Our Record speaks about you with truth. Verily, We were recording what you used to do (i.e. Our angels used to record your deeds).",""
  45,30,"Then, as for those who believed (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) and did righteous good deeds, their Lord will admit them to His Mercy. That will be the evident success.",""
  45,31,"But as for those who disbelieved (it will be said to them): ""Were not Our Verses recited to you? But you were proud, and you were a people who were Mujrimûn (polytheists, disbelievers, sinners, criminals).""",""
  45,32,"And when it was said: ""Verily, Allâh’s Promise is the truth, and there is no doubt about the coming of the Hour,"" you said: ""We know not what is the Hour: we do not think it but as a conjecture, and we have no firm convincing belief (therein).""",""
