quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,10,"Verily, those who disbelieve, neither their properties nor their offspring will avail them whatsoever against Allâh; and it is they who will be fuel of the Fire.",""
  3,11,"Like the behaviour of the people of Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and those before them; they belied Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.). So Allâh seized (destroyed) them for their sins. And Allâh is Severe in punishment.",""
  3,12,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) to those who disbelieve: ""You will be defeated and gathered together to Hell, and worst indeed is that place to rest.""",""
  3,13,"There has already been a sign for you (O Jews) in the two armies that met (in combat i.e. the battle of Badr). One was fighting in the Cause of Allâh, and as for the other, (they) were disbelievers. They (the believers) saw them (the disbelievers) with their own eyes twice their number (although they were thrice their number). And Allâh supports with His Victory whom He wills. Verily, in this is a lesson for those who understand. (See Verse 8:44). (Tafsir At-Tabarî)",""
  3,14,"Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women, children, much of gold and silver (wealth), branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land. This is the pleasure of the present world’s life; but Allâh has the excellent return (Paradise with flowing rivers) with Him.",""
  3,15,"Say: ""Shall I inform you of things far better than those? For Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2) there are Gardens (Paradise) with their Lord, underneath which rivers flow. Therein (is their) eternal (home) and Azwâjun Mutahharatun <sup>1</sup> (purified mates or wives). And Allâh will be pleased with them. And Allâh is All-Seer of the (His) slaves"".","[1] (V.3:15) i.e. they will have no menses, urine, or stool, See Tafsir Ibn Kathir and also see footnote of (V.29:64)."
