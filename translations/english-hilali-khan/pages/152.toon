  7,12,"(Allâh) said: ""What prevented you (O Iblîs) that you did not prostrate yourself, when I commanded you?"" Iblîs said: ""I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire, and him You created from clay.""",""
  7,13,"(Allâh) said: ""(O Iblîs) get down from this (Paradise), it is not for you to be arrogant here. Get out, for you are of those humiliated and disgraced.""",""
  7,14,"(Iblîs) said: ""Allow me respite till the Day they are raised up (i.e. the Day of Resurrection).""",""
  7,15,"(Allâh) said: ""You are of those respited.""",""
  7,16,"(Iblîs) said: ""Because You have sent me astray, surely I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your Straight Path.",""
  7,17,"""Then I will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of them as thankful ones (i.e. they will not be dutiful to You).""",""
  7,18,"(Allâh) said (to Iblîs): ""Get out from this (Paradise), disgraced and expelled. Whoever of them (mankind) will follow you, then surely I will fill Hell with you all.""",""

  7,20,"Then Shaitân (Satan) whispered suggestions to them both in order to uncover that which was hidden from them of their private parts (before); he said: ""Your Lord did not forbid you this tree save that you should become angels or become of the immortals.""",""
  7,21,"And he [Shaitân (Satan)] swore by Allâh to them both (saying): ""Verily, I am one of the sincere well-wishers for you both.""",""
  7,22,"So he misled them with deception. Then when they tasted of the tree, that which was hidden from them of their shame (private parts) became manifest to them and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise (in order to cover their shame). And their Lord called out to them (saying): ""Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you: Verily, Shaitân (Satan) is an open enemy unto you?""",""
