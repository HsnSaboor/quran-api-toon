quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  35,39,"He it is Who has made you successors generations after generations in the earth, so whosoever disbelieves (in Islâmic Monotheism) on him will be his disbelief. And the disbelief of the disbelievers adds nothing but hatred of their Lord. And the disbelief of the disbelievers adds nothing but loss.<sup>2</sup>","[2] (V.35:39) See the footnote of (V.3:85)."
  35,40,"Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ""Tell me or inform me (what) do you think about your (so-called) partner-gods to whom you call upon besides Allâh? Show me, what they have created of the earth. Or have they any share in the heavens? Or have We given them a Book, so that they act on clear proof therefrom? Nay, the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) promise one another nothing but delusions.""",""
  35,41,"Verily! Allâh grasps the heavens and the earth lest they should move away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, there is not one that could grasp them after Him. Truly, He is Ever Most Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.<sup>3</sup>","[3] (V.35:41) Narrated Abû Hurairah رضي الله عنه: I heard Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, ""(On the Day of Resurrection) Allah will grasp the whole planet of earth (by His Hand), and roll all the heavens up with His Right Hand, and then He will say, ‘I am the King; where are the kings of the earth?’ "" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadîth No.336)."
  35,42,"And they swore by Allâh their most binding oath that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than any of the nations (before them); yet when a warner (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) came to them, it increased in them nothing but flight (from the truth)",""
  35,43,"(They took to flight because of their) arrogance in the land and their plotting of evil. But the evil plot encompasses only him who makes it. Then, can they expect anything (else) but the Sunnah (way of dealing) of the peoples of old? So no change will you find in Allâh’s Sunnah (way of dealing), and no turning off will you find in Allâh’s Sunnah (way of dealing).",""
  35,44,"Have they not travelled in the land, and seen what was the end of those before them - though they were superior to them in power? Allâh is not such that anything in the heavens or in the earth escapes Him. Verily, He is All-Knowing, All-Omnipotent.",""
