(The Prophet) Ibrâhîm (Abraham) will say (to him): ‘Didn’t I tell you not to disobey me?’ His father will reply: ‘Today I will not disobey you.’ Ibrâhîm (Abraham) will say: ‘O Lord! You promised me not to disgrace me on the Day of Resurrection; and what will be more disgraceful to me than cursing and dishonouring my father?’ Then Allâh تعالى will say (to him): ‘I have forbidden Paradise for the disbelievers.’ Then he will be addressed, ‘O Ibrâhîm (Abraham)! Look! What is underneath your feet?’ He will look and there he will see a Dhîkh (Hyena,) blood-stained, which will be caught by the legs and thrown in the (Hell) Fire.""
