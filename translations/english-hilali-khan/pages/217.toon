  10,71,"And recite to them the news of Nûh (Noah). When he said to his people: ""O my people, if my stay (with you), and my reminding (you) of the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh is hard on you, then I put my trust in Allâh. So devise your plot, you and your partners, and let not your plot be in doubt for you. Then pass your sentence on me and give me no respite.",""
  10,72,"""But if you turn away [from accepting my doctrine of Islâmic Monotheism, i.e. to worship none but Allâh], then no reward have I asked of you; my reward is only from Allâh, and I have been commanded to be of the Muslims (i.e. those who submit to Allâh’s Will).""",""
  10,73,"They denied him, but We delivered him, and those with him in the ship, and We made them generations replacing one after another, while We drowned those who belied Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.). Then see what was the end of those who were warned.",""
  10,74,"Then after him We sent Messengers to their people. They brought them clear proofs, but they would not believe what they had already rejected beforehand. Thus We seal the hearts of the transgressors (those who disbelieve in the Oneness of Allâh and disobey Him).",""
  10,75,"Then after them We sent Mûsâ (Moses) and Hârûn (Aaron) to Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his chiefs with Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.). But they behaved arrogantly and were Mujrimûn (disbelievers, sinners, polytheists, criminals) folk.",""
  10,76,"So when came to them the truth from Us, they said: ""This is indeed clear magic.""",""
  10,77,"Mûsâ (Moses) said: ""Say you (this) about the truth when it has come to you? Is this magic? But the magicians will never be successful.""",""
  10,78,"They said: ""Have you come to us to turn us away from that (Faith) we found our fathers following, and that you two may have greatness in the land? We are not going to believe you two!""",""
