quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,142,"The fools among the people (pagans, hypocrites, and Jews) will say, ""What has turned them (Muslims) from their Qiblah [prayer direction (towards Jerusalem)] to which they used to face in prayer."" Say, (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) ""To Allâh belong both, east and the west. He guides whom He wills to the Straight Way.""",""
  2,143,"Thus We have made you [true Muslims - real believers of Islâmic Monotheism, true followers of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and his Sunnah (legal ways)], a just (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind<sup>29</sup> and the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) be a witness over you. And We made the Qiblah (prayer direction towards Jerusalem) which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) from those who would turn on their heels (i.e. disobey the Messenger). Indeed it was great (heavy) except for those whom Allâh guided. And Allâh would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e. your prayers offered towards Jerusalem). Truly, Allâh is full of Kindness, the Most Merciful towards mankind.","[29] (V.2:143) Narrated Abu Sa‘îd Al-Khudrî رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said ""Nûh (Noah) will be called on the Day of Resurrection and he will say, ‘Labbaik and Sa‘daik, (I respond to Your Call and I am obedient to Your Orders) O my Lord! Allâh will say, ‘Did you convey Our Message of Islâmic Monotheism?’ Nûh (Noah) will say, ‘Yes’. His nation will then be asked, ‘Did he convey Our Message of Islâmic Monotheism to you?’ They will say, ‘No warner came to us.’ Then Allâh will say [to Nûh (Noah)], ‘Who will bear witness in your favour?’ He will say, ‘Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and his followers.’ So they (i.e., Muslims) will testify that he conveyed the Message - and the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will be a witness over you, and that is what is meant by the Statement of Allâh عز وجل: We made you [true Muslims - real believers of Islâmic Monotheism, true followers of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and his Sunnah (legal ways)] a just (and the best) nation that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will be a witness over you."" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol.6, Hadîth No.14)."
  2,144,"Verily! We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad’s صلى الله عليه وسلم) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid-al-Harâm (at Makkah). And wheresoever you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction. Certainly, the people who were given the Scripture (i.e. Jews and the Christians) know well that, that (your turning towards the direction of the Ka‘bah at Makkah in prayers) is the truth from their Lord. And Allâh is not unaware of what they do.",""
  2,145,"And even if you were to bring to the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) all the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they would not follow your Qiblah (prayer direction), nor are you going to follow their Qiblah (prayer direction). And they will not follow each other’s Qiblah (prayer direction). Verily, if you follow their desires after that which you have received of knowledge (from Allâh), then indeed you will be one of the Zâlimûn (polytheists, wrong-doers).",""
