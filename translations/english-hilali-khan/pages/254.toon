  13,35,"The description of the Paradise which the Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2) have been promised: Underneath it rivers flow, its provision is eternal and so is its shade; this is the end (final destination) of the Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2), and the end (final destination) of the disbelievers is Fire. (See Verse 47:15)",""
  13,36,"Those to whom We have given the Book (such as ‘Abdullâh bin Salâm and other Jews who embraced Islâm), rejoice at what has been revealed unto you (i.e. the Qur’ân),<sup>7</sup> but there are among the Confederates (from the Jews and pagans) those who reject a part thereof. Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم): ""I am commanded only to worship Allâh (Alone) and not to join partners with Him. To Him (Alone) I call and to Him is my return.""","[7] (V.13:36) See the footnote of (V.5:66)."
  13,37,"And thus have We sent it (the Qur’ân) down to be a judgement of authority in Arabic. Were you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to follow their (vain) desires after the knowledge which has come to you, then you will not have any Walî (protector) or Wâq (defender) against Allâh.",""
  13,38,"And indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) and made for them wives and offspring. And it was not for a Messenger to bring a sign except by Allâh’s Leave. (For) every matter there is a Decree (from Allâh). [Tafsir Al-Tabari]",""
  13,39,"Allâh blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother of the Book (Al-Lauh Al-Mahfûz)",""
  13,40,"Whether We show you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) part of what We have promised them or cause you to die, your duty is only to convey (the Message) and on Us is the reckoning.",""
  13,41,"See they not that We gradually reduce the land (of the disbelievers, by giving it to the believers, in war victories) from its outlying borders. And Allâh judges, there is none to put back His Judgement and He is Swift at reckoning.",""
  13,42,"And verily, those before them did devise plots, but all planning is Allâh’s. He knows what every person earns, and the disbelievers will know who gets the good end (final destination).",""
