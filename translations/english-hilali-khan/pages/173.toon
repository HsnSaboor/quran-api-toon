  7,171,"And (remember) when We raised the mountain over them as if it had been a canopy, and they thought that it was going to fall on them. (We said): ""Hold firmly to what We have given you [i.e. the Taurât (Torah)], and remember that which is therein (act on its commandments), so that you may fear Allâh and obey Him.""",""
  7,172,"And (remember) when your Lord brought forth from the Children of Adam, from their loins, their seed (or from Adam’s loin his offspring) and made them testify as to themselves (saying): ""Am I not your Lord?"" They said: ""Yes! We testify,"" lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection: ""Verily, we have been unaware of this.""",""
  7,173,"Or lest you should say: ""It was only our fathers afortime who took others as partners in worship along with Allâh, and we were (merely their) descendants after them; will You then destroy us because of the deeds of men who practised Al-Bâtil (i.e. polytheism and committing crimes and sins, invoking and worshipping others besides Allâh)?"" (Tafsir At-Tabarî).",""
  7,174,"Thus do We explain the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in detail, so that they may turn (unto the truth).",""
  7,175,"And recite (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), but he threw them away; so Shaitân (Satan) followed him up, and he became of those who went astray.",""
  7,176,"And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith but he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desire. So his parable is the parable of a dog: if you drive him away, he lolls his tongue out, or if you leave him alone, he (still) lolls his tongue out. Such is the parable of the people who reject Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.). So relate the stories, perhaps they may reflect.",""
  7,177,"Evil is the parable of the people who rejected Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses and signs, etc.), and used to wrong their ownselves.",""
  7,178,"Whomsoever Allâh guides, he is the guided one, and whomsoever He sends astray,- then those! they are the losers.",""
