  36,19,"They (Messengers) said: ""Your evil omens be with you! (Do you call it ""evil omen"") because you are admonished? Nay, but you are a people Musrifûn (transgressing all bounds by committing all kinds of great sins, and by disobeying Allâh).",""

(Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.489).\nb) Narrated Anas bin Mâlik رضي الله عنه : The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ""Nobody who enters Paradise likes to go back to the world even if he got everything on the earth, except a martyr who wishes to return to the world so that he may be martyred ten times because of the honour and dignity he received (from Allâh).""

I seek refuge with You from helplessness, laziness, cowardice and senile old age; I seek refuge with You from Fitan (trials and afflictions) of life and death and seek refuge with You from the punishment in the grave."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.4, Hadith No.77).\ne) Narrated ‘Abdullah bin Umar رضي الله عنهما: I heard Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, ""People are just like camels: out of one hundred, one can hardly find a single camel suitable to ride.""
