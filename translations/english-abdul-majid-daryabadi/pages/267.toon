quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  15,91,Those who have made the scripture bits
  15,92,"By thy Lord, We will question them all"
  15,93,For that which they have been working
  15,94,"Promulgate thou that which thou art commanded, and turn away from the associaters"
  15,95,Verily We will suffice unto thee against the mockers
  15,96,Who set up along with Allah anot her god; presently they shall know
  15,97,And assuredly We know that thou straitenest thy breast by that which they say
  15,98,"So hallow thou the praise of thy Lord, and be thou of the prostrate"
  15,99,And worship thy Lord until there cometh unto thee the certainty
  16,1,"The affair of Allah cometh, so seek not to hasten it. Hallowed be He and Exalted above that which they associate"
  16,2,"He sendeth down the angels with the spirit by His command upon whomsoever of his bondmen He willeth: warn that there is no god but I, wherefore fear Me"
  16,3,He hath created the heavens and the earth with a purpose. Exalted is He above that which they associate
  16,4,"He hath created man from a drop, and Lo! he is a disputer open"
  16,5,And the cattle! He hath created them. For you in them there is warmth and other profits and of them ye eat
  16,6,And for you there is beauty in them as ye drive them at eventide and as ye drive them out to pasture
