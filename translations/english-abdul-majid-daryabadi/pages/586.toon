quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun shall be wound round
  81,2,And when the stars shall dart down
  81,3,And when the mountains shall be made to pass away
  81,4,And when the she-camels big with young shall be abandoned
  81,5,And when the wild beasts shall be gathered together
  81,6,And when the seas shall be filled
  81,7,And when the souls he paired
  81,8,And when the girl buried alive shall be asked
  81,9,For what sin she was slain
  81,10,And when the Writs shall be lain open
  81,11,And when the heaven shall be stripped
  81,12,And when the Scorch shall be made to blaze
  81,13,And when the Garden shall be brought nigh
  81,14,"Then every soul shall know that which it: hath presented"
  81,15,I swear by the receding stars
  81,16,Moving swiftly and hiding themselves
  81,17,And by the night when it departeth
  81,18,And by the morning when it shineth forth
  81,19,Verily it is a Word brought by a messenger honoured
  81,20,"Owner of strength, of established dignity with the Lord of the Throne"
  81,21,Obeyed one there; trustWorthy
  81,22,Nor is your companion distracted
  81,23,Assuredly he beheld him in the horizon manifest
  81,24,And he is of the unseen not a tenacious concealer
  81,25,Nor is it the word of a Satan accursed
  81,26,Whither then go ye
  81,27,This is naught but an Admonition Unto the worlds
  81,28,Unto whomsoever of you willeth to walk straight
  81,29,"And ye shall not will unless it be that Allah, the Lord of the worlds, willeth"
