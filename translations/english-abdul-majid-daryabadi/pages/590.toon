quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  85,1,By the heaven adorned with big stars
  85,2,And by the Day promised
  85,3,And by the Day witnessing and the Day witnessed
  85,4,Perish the fellows of the ditch
  85,5,Of fire fuel-fed
  85,6,When they sat by it
  85,7,And to that which they did to the believers were witnesses
  85,8,"And they persecuted them for naught save that they believed in Allah, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy"
  85,9,"Him, Whose is the dominion of heavens and the earth. And Allah is over everything a Witness"
  85,10,"Verily those who affected the believing men and the believing women, and then repented not, theirs shall be the torment of Hell, and theirs shall be the torment of burning"
  85,11,"Verily those who believed and worked righteons works, theirs shall be Gardens whereunder the rivers flow; that is the supreme achievement"
  85,12,Verily the grip of thine Lord is severe
  85,13,Verily He! He it is who beginneth and repeateth it
  85,14,"And He is the Fogiving, the Loving"
  85,15,"Lord of the Throne, the Glorious"
  85,16,Doer of whatsoever He intendeth
  85,17,Hath there come Unto thee the story of the hosts
  85,18,Of the Fir'awn and the Thamud
  85,19,But those who disbelieve are engaged in denial
  85,20,"Whereas Allah is, from behind them, Encompassing"
  85,21,Aye! it is a Recitation glorious
  85,22,Inscribed in a tablet preserved
