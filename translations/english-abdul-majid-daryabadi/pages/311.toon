quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Hast thou observed him who disbelieveth in Our signs and saith: surely I shall be vouchsafed riches and children"
  19,78,"Hath he looked unto the Unseen, or hath he taken of the Compassionate a covenant"
  19,79,By no means! We shall write down that which he saith; and We shall lengthen for him of the torment a length
  19,80,"And We shall inherit from him that whereof he spake, and he shall come to us alone"
  19,81,And they have taken gods beside Allah that they might be unto them a glory
  19,82,"By no means! anon they shall deny their worship, and become unto them an adversary"
  19,83,Beholdest thou not that We have sent the satans upon the infidels inciting them by an incitement
  19,84,So hasten thou not against them; We are only counting against them a counting
  19,85,On the Day whereon We shall gather the God-feaing unto the Com- passionate as an embassy
  19,86,And shall drive the culprits to Hell as a herd
  19,87,"They shall not own intercession, excepting those who have taken of the Compassionate a covenant"
  19,88,"And they say: the Compassionate hath taken a son"
  19,89,Assuredly ye have brought a thing monstrous
  19,90,Well-nigh the heavens are rent thereat and the earth cleft in sunder and the mountains fall down in pieces
  19,91,That they should ascribe unto the Compassionate a son
  19,92,And it behoveth not the Compassionate that he should take a son
  19,93,None there is in the heavens and the earth but must come unto the Compassionate as a bondman
  19,94,Assuredly He hath comprehanded them and counted them a full Counting
  19,95,And each of them is to come to Him on the Day of Judgment alone
