quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,And a sign Unto them is that We bear their offspring in a laden ship
  36,42,And We have created for them of the like thereUnto whereon they ride
  36,43,"And if We list, We shall drown them, and there will be no shout for them, nor will they be saved"
  36,44,"unless it be a mercy from us, and as an enjoyment for a season"
  36,45,"And when it is said Unto them: fear that which is before you and that which is behind you, that haply ye may find mercy, they withdraw"
  36,46,"And not a sign cometh Unto them of the signs of their Lord, but they are ever backsliders therefrom"
  36,47,"And when it is said Unto them: expend of that wherewith Allah hath provided you, those who disbelieve say Unto those who believe: shall we feed those whom God Himself would have fed, if He listed? Ye are in naught else than error manifest"
  36,48,"And they say: when will this promise be fulfilled if ye say sooth"
  36,49,"They await not but one shout, which shall lay hold of them while they are yet wrangling"
  36,50,"And they will not be able to make a disposition, nor to their family they return"
  36,51,"And the trumpet shall be blown, and lo! from the tombs Unto their Lord they shall be hastening"
  36,52,"They will say: Ah woe Unto us! who hath roused us from our sleeping-place? This is that which the Compassionate had promised, and truly spake the sent ones"
  36,53,It shall be but one shout; and lo! they shall all be brought together before us
  36,54,To-day no soul will be wronged at all; nor shall ye be requited but for that which ye have been working
