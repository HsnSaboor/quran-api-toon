quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,What shall that which they enjoyed avail them
  26,208,And We destroyed not a city but it had its warners
  26,209,"By way of admonition, and We have never been oppressors"
  26,210,And the satans have not brought it down
  26,211,"It behoveth them not, nor they can"
  26,212,Verily far from hearing are they removed
  26,213,"So call not thou unto anot her god along with Allah, lest thou be of the doomed"
  26,214,"And warn thou thy clan, the nearest ones"
  26,215,And lower thou thy Wlng Unto those who follow thee as believers
  26,216,"And if they disobey thee, say thou: verily I am quit of that which ye work"
  26,217,"And rely thou upon the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,218,Who seeth thee when thou standest up
  26,219,And thy movements among those who fall prostrate
  26,220,"Verily He! He is the Hearer, the Knower"
  26,221,Shall declare unto you upon whom the satans descend
  26,222,"They descend upon every calumniator, sinner"
  26,223,"Who give ear, and most of them are liars"
  26,224,As for the poets -it is the seduced who follow them
  26,225,"Observest thou not, that they Wander about every vale"
  26,226,And that they say that which they do not
  26,227,"Save those who believed and worked righteous works and remembered Allah much, and vindicated themselves after they had been wronged. And anon those who do wrong shall come to know with what a translating they shall be translated"
