quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,Though they shall be made to see one another. Fain would the guilty ransom himself from the torment of that Day by his children
  70,12,And his spouse and his brother
  70,13,And his kin that sheltered him
  70,14,And all who are on the earth; so that this might deliver him
  70,15,By no means! Verily it is a Flame
  70,16,Flaying off the scalp-skin
  70,17,It shall calll him who turneth back and backslideth
  70,18,And masseth and then hoardeth
  70,19,Verily man is formed impatient
  70,20,"When evil toucheth him, he is bewailing"
  70,21,And when good toucheth him he is begrudging
  70,22,Not so are the prayerful
  70,23,Who are at their prayer constant
  70,24,And those in whose riches is a known right
  70,25,For the beggar and the destitute
  70,26,And those who testify to the Day of Requital
  70,27,And those who are fearful of their Lord's torment
  70,28,Verily the torment of their Lord is not a thing to feel secure from
  70,29,And those who of their private parts are guards
  70,30,Save in regard to their spouses or those whom their right hands own; so verily they are not blameworthy
  70,31,"And whosoever seeketh beyond that, then it is those who are the trespassers"
  70,32,And those who of their trusts and their covenant are keepers
  70,33,And those who stand firm in their testimonies
  70,34,And those who of their prayer are observant
  70,35,"Those shall dwell in Gardens, honoured"
  70,36,"What aileth those who disbelieve, toward thee hastening"
  70,37,"On the right and on the left, in companies"
  70,38,"Coveteth every man of them, that he shall enter the Garden of Delight"
  70,39,By no means! veriiy We! We have created them from that which they know
