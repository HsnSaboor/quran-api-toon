  4,87,"Allah! there is no god but he. Surely He shall gather you together on the Day of Resurrecticn, whereof there is no doubt; and who is more truthful than Allah in discourse"
  4,88,"What aileth you then, that ye are two parties regarding the hypocrites? whereas Allah hath reverted them because of that which they have earned. Would ye lead aright those whom Allah hath sent astray? And whomsoever Allah sendeth astray, for him thou shalt not find a way"
  4,89,"Fain would they that ye disbelieved even as they have disbelieved, so that ye may be all alike. Wherefore take not friends from among them until they migrate for the sake of Allah; and if they turn away, then lay hold of them and slay them, wheresoever ye find them, and take not from among them a friend or a helper"
  4,90,"Excepting those who join a people between whom and you there is a bond or who come to you with their breasts straitened that they should fight you or fight their own people. And had Allah so willed, He would have surely set them upon you. If then they withdraw from you, and fight not against you and offer you peace, then Allah openoth not for you against them a way"
  4,91,"Surely ye will find others desiring, that they may be secure from you and may be secure from their people; and yet so oft as they are brought back into the temptation, they revert thereto. Wherefore if they withdraw not from you, nor offer you peace, nor restrain their hands, lay hold of them and slay them wheresoever ye find them. These: against them We have given you a clear warranty"
