quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,That it is a Recitation honourable
  56,78,In a Book Hidden
  56,79,Which none can touch except the purified
  56,80,It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
  56,81,Is it this discourse that ye hold lightly
  56,82,And make it your provision that ye should belie it
  56,83,Wherefore then - when the soul cometh up to the wind-pipe
  56,84,And ye are then looking on
  56,85,"And We are nigher Unto him than ye are, but ye behold not"
  56,86,"Wherefore then, if ye are not to be requited"
  56,87,"Cause ye it not to return, if ye say sooth"
  56,88,Then if he be of the broughtnigh
  56,89,"For him shall be comfort, and fragrance and a Garden of Delight"
  56,90,And if he be of the fellows on the right hand
  56,91,"Then: peace Unto thee, for thou art of those on the right hand"
  56,92,"And if he be of the beliers, the erring"
  56,93,Then an entertainment of boiling water
  56,94,And roasting in a Blaze
  56,95,Verily this! this is the very truth
  56,96,"Wherefore hallow thou the name of thy Lord, the Mighty"
  57,1,"Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth halloweth Allah; and He is the Mighty, the Wise"
  57,2,His is the dominion of the heavens and the earth; He giveth life and He causeth to die; and He is over everything Potent
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last, and the OutWard and the inward, and He is of everything the Knower"
