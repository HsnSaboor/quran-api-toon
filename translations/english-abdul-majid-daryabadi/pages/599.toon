quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  98,8,"Their recompense with their Lord shall be Gardens Everlasting, whereunder rivers flow - as abiders therein for evermore. Well-pleases will be Allah with them and well-pleased will be they with Him, That is for him who feareth his Lord"
  99,1,When the earth is shaken by the shaking thereof
  99,2,And the earth bringeth forth her burthens
  99,3,"And man saith: what aileth her"
  99,4,On that Day she will tell out the tidings thereof
  99,5,Because thy Lord will inspire her
  99,6,"On that Day mankind will proceed in bands, that they may be shewn their works"
  99,7,Then whosoever hath worked good of an atom's weight shall behold it
  99,8,And whosoever hath worked ill Of an atom's weight shall behold it
  100,1,By the chargers panting
  100,2,And striking off fire by dashing their hoofs
  100,3,And raiding at dawn
  100,4,And therein raising dust
  100,5,And cleaving their way therein into the host
  100,6,Verily man is Unto his Lord ungrateful
  100,7,And verily to that he is witness
  100,8,And verily in the love of wealth he is vehement
  100,9,"Knoweth he not - when that which is in the graves, shall be ransacked"
