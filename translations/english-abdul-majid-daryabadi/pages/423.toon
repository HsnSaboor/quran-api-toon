quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,"And it is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His apostle have decreed an affair, that they should have any choice in their affair. And whosoever disobeyeth Allah and His apostle hath strayed with a manifest straying"
  33,37,"And recall what time thou wast saying unto him on whom Allah had conferred favour and thou hadst conferred favour: keep thy wife to thyself and fear Allah; so and thou wast concealing in thy mind that which Allah was going to disclose, and thou wast fearing mankind, whereas Allah had a better right that Him thou shouldst fear. Then when Zaid had performed his purpose concerning her, We wedded her to thee, that there should be no blame for believers in respect of wives of their adopted sons, when they have performed their purpose concerning them. And the ordinance of Allah was to be fulfilled"
  33,38,No blame there is upon the Prophet in that which Allah hath decreed for him. That hath been Allah's dispensation with those who have passed away afore - and the ordinance of Allah hath been a destiny destined
  33,39,"Those who preached the messages of Allah and feared Him, and feared none save Allah; and Allah sufficeth as a Reckoner"
  33,40,"Muhammad is not the father of any of your males, but the apostle of Allah and the seal of the prophets; and Allah of everything is ever the Knower"
  33,41,O Ye who believe! remember Allah with much remembrance
  33,42,And hallow Him morning and evening
  33,43,He it is Who sendeth His benedictions to you and His angels also that he may bring you forth from darknessess into light; and unto the believers He is ever Merciful
