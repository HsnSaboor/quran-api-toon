quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,25,What aileth you that ye succour not one another
  37,26,Nay! on that Day they will be entirely submissive
  37,27,And they will advance toward each other mutually questioning
  37,28,"They will say: verily ye! ye were wont to come Unto us Imposing"
  37,29,"They will say: nay! ye yourselves were not believers"
  37,30,"And we had over you no authority, but ye were a people exorbitant"
  37,31,"So on us hath been justified the sentence of our Lord: verily we are to taste"
  37,32,We seduced you astray; verily we were ourselves the seduced ones
  37,33,So verily on that Day they all in the torment will be sharers
  37,34,Verily We! in this wise We deal with the culprits
  37,35,"Verily when it was said Unto them: there is no god but Allah, they ever grew stiff-necked"
  37,36,"And they said: are we going to abandon our gods on account of a Poet distracted"
  37,37,"Aye! he hath come with the truth, and he confesseth to the sent ones"
  37,38,Verily ye are going to taste a torment afflictive
  37,39,And ye shall be required not except for that which ye have been doing
  37,40,"But the bondmen of Allah, the sincere ones"
  37,41,Those! theirs shall be a provision known
  37,42,Fruits! And they shall be honoured
  37,43,In Gardens of Delight
  37,44,"On couches, facing one another"
  37,45,Round shall be passed a cup Unto them filled with limpid drink
  37,46,"White, a pleasure Unto the drinkers"
  37,47,"No headiness there shall be therein, nor shall they be therewith Inebriated"
  37,48,"And with them shall be damsels of refraining looks, large- eyed"
  37,49,As though they were eggs hidden
  37,50,"Then they will advance Unto each other, mutually questioning"
  37,51,"And a speaker from among them will say: verily there was Unto me a mate"
