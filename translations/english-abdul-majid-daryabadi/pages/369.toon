quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,40,Belike we may follow the magicians if they are the winners
  26,41,"Then when the magicians came, they said unto Fir'awn: will there surely be a big hire for us if we are the winners"
  26,42,"He said: yea; and ye shall verily then be of those brought nigh"
  26,43,"Musa said unto them: cast whatsoever ye have to cast"
  26,44,"Then they cast their cords and their staves, and said: by the might of Fir'awn, verily we! we shall be the winners"
  26,45,"Then Musa cast down his staff, and lo! it swallowed up that which they had devised"
  26,46,Then the magicians flung themselves prostrate
  26,47,"They said: we believe in the Lord of the worlds"
  26,48,The Lord of Musa and Harun
  26,49,"Fir'awn said: ye believed in him ere I gave you leave. Verily he is your chief who hath taught you magic, so ye shall surely come to know. Surely I shall cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and surely I shall crucify you all"
  26,50,"They said: no harm! verily unto our Lord we are to return"
  26,51,Verily we long that our Lord shall forgive us our faults because we have been the first of the believers
  26,52,"And We revealed unto Musa saying: go by night with My bondmen verily ye shall be pursued"
  26,53,Then Fir'awn sent unto the cities callers
  26,54,Verily these are but a band small
  26,55,And verily they have enraged US
  26,56,And verily we are host well-provided
  26,57,Then We drave them forth from gardens and springs
  26,58,And treasures and a station noble
  26,59,Even so. And We caused the Children of Isra'il to inherit them
  26,60,Then they pursued them at sunrise
