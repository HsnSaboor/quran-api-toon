  80,1,He frowned and turned away
  80,2,Because there came Unto him a blind man
  80,3,"How canst thou know, whether haply he might be cleansed"
  80,4,"Or be admonished, so that the admonition might have profited him"
  80,5,As for him who regardeth himself self-sufficient
  80,6,Unto him thou attendest
  80,7,Whereas it is not on thee that he is not cleansed
  80,8,And as for him who cometh Unto thee running
  80,9,And he feareth
  80,10,Him thou neglectest
  80,11,By no means! Verily it is an admonition
  80,12,So whosoever willeth-let him be admonished therewlth
  80,13,Inscribed in Writs honoured
  80,14,"Exalted, Purified"
  80,15,By the hands of scribes
  80,16,Honourable and virtuous
  80,17,Perish man! how ungrateful he is
  80,18,Of what thing hath He created him
  80,19,Of a drop of seed. He created him and formed him according to a measure
  80,20,Then the way He made easy
  80,21,Then He caused him to die and made him to be buried
  80,22,"Then when He listeth, He shall raise him to life"
  80,23,By no means He performed not that which He had commanded him
  80,24,Let man look at his food
  80,25,"It is We Who pour forth water, pouring"
  80,26,Thereafter We cleave the earth in clefts
  80,27,Then We cause therein the grain to grow
  80,28,And grapes and vegetables
  80,29,And olives and palms
  80,30,And enclosed gardens luxuriant
  80,31,And fruits and herbage
  80,32,A provision for you and for your cattle
  80,33,Then when cometh the Deafening Cry
  80,34,On the Day whereon a man shall flee from his brother
  80,35,And his mother and his father
  80,36,And his wife and his sons
  80,37,For every one of them on that Day shall be business enough to occupy
  80,38,Faces on that Day shall be beaming
  80,39,"Laughing, rejoicing"
  80,40,And faces on that Day! upon them shall be gloom
  80,41,Dust shall cover them
  80,42,"Those! they are the infidels, the ungodly"
