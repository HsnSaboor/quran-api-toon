quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,"Not equal are the holders back among the believers, save those who are disabled, and the strivers in the way of Allah with their- riches and their lives. Allah hath preferred in rank the strivers with their riches and their lives above the holders-back, and unto all Allah hath promised good. And Allah hath preferred the strivers above the holdersback with a mighty hire"
  4,96,"Ranks from Him and forgiveness and mercy; and Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful"
  4,97,"Verily unto those whom the angels carry off in death, while they are yet oppressors of their souls, they will say: what were ye in? They will say: Weakened were we in the land. They Will say: was not Allah's land wide so that ye could migrate thereto. These: their resort is hell an evil retreat"
  4,98,"Excepting the weak ones among men, women and children, unable to find a stratagem and not guided to a way"
  4,99,"These: belike Allah will pardon them, and Allah is ever Pardoning, Forgiving"
  4,100,"And whosoever migrateth in the way of Allah, shall find in the earth plentiful refuge and ampleness; and whosoever goes forth from his house as a fugitive unto Allah and His apostle, and death then overtaketh him his hire hath surely devolved upon Allah, and Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful"
  4,101,"And when ye are journeying in the earth there shall be no fault in you that ye shorten the prayer if ye fear that those who disbelieve shall molest you, verily the infidels are ever unto you an avowed enemy"
