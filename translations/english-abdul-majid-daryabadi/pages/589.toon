quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,"Reclining on couches, looking on"
  83,36,The infidels have indeed been rewarded for that which they had been doing
  84,1,When the heaven is sundered
  84,2,"And it hearkeneth to its Lord, and is duteous"
  84,3,And when the earth shall be stretched forth
  84,4,"And shall cast forth that which is therein, and shall become empty"
  84,5,"And it hearkeneth to its Lord, and is duteous"
  84,6,"O man! verily thou art toiling toward thy Lord a painful toiling, and art about to meet Him"
  84,7,Then as to him who shall be given his book in his right hand
  84,8,His account shall presently be taken by an easy reckoning
  84,9,And he shall return Unto his people joyfully
  84,10,And as to him who shall be given his book from behind his back
  84,11,He shall presently call for death
  84,12,And he shall roast into a Blaze
  84,13,Verily he was among his people joyous
  84,14,Verily he imagined that he would not be back
  84,15,Yea! his Lord had ever been beholding him
  84,16,I swear by the afterglow of sunset
  84,17,And by the night and that which it driveth together
  84,18,And by the moon when she becometh full
  84,19,Surely ye shall ride layer upon layer
  84,20,"What aileth them then, that they believe not"
  84,21,"And that, when the Qur'an is read Unto them, they prostrate not them-selves"
  84,22,Yea those who disbelieve belie
  84,23,Whereas Allah knoweth best that which they cherish
  84,24,Wherefore announce thou Unto them a torment afflictive
  84,25,"But those who believe and work righteous works, theirs shall be a hire unending"
