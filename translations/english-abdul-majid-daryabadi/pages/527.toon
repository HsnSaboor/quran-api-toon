quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,Verily those who believe not in the Hereafter name the angels with the names of females
  53,28,"And they have no knowledge thereof; they follow but a vain opinion, and verily a vain opinion attaineth not aught of the truth"
  53,29,Wherefore withdraw thou from him who turneth away from Our admonition and seeketh not but the life of the world
  53,30,"That is their highest point of knowledge. Verily thine Lord! it is He Who is the Best Knower of him who strayeth from His way, and He is the Best Knower of him who letteth himself be guided"
  53,31,"And Allah's is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, that He may recompense those who do evil for that which they worked and reward those who do good with good"
  53,32,"They are those who avoid enormities of sin and abominations save the minor offences. Verily thy Lord is of vast for giveness: He is Best Knower of you when He produced you out Of the earth, and when ye were embryos in the bellies of your mothers. So justify not yourselves; He is the Best Knower of him who feareth Him"
  53,33,Observedest thou him who turned away
  53,34,"And gave little, and then stopped"
  53,35,Is with him knowledge of the unseen so that he seeth
  53,36,Hath he not been told of that which is in the writs of Musa
  53,37,And of Ibrahim who faithfully fulfilled
  53,38,"To wit, that a burthened soul shall not bear the burthen of another"
  53,39,And that for man shall be naught save that wherefor he endeavoureth
  53,40,And that his endeavour shall be presently observed
  53,41,Thereafter he shall be recompensed therefor with the fullest recompense
  53,42,And that Unto thy Lord is the goal
  53,43,And that it is He Who causeth to laugh and causeth to weep
  53,44,And that it is He Who causeth to die and causeth to live
