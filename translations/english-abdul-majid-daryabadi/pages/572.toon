quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  72,1,"Say thou: it hath been revealed Unto me that a company of the Jinn listened, and said, verily we have listened to a Recitation wondrous"
  72,2,"Guiding Unto rectitude; wherefore we have believed therein, and we shall by no means associate with our Lord anyone"
  72,3,And He - exalted be the majesty of our Lord!-hath taken neither a spouse nor a son
  72,4,And the foolish among us were wont to forge lie against Allah exceedingly
  72,5,And verily we! we had imagined that humankind and Jinn would never forge against Allah a lie
  72,6,"And persons among humankind have been seeking refuge with persons of the Jinn, so that they increased them in evil disposition"
  72,7,"And indeed they imagined, even as ye imagined, that Allah will not raise any one"
  72,8,And we sought to reach the heaven; then we found it filled with a strong guard and darting meteors
  72,9,And we were wont to sit on seats therein to listen; but whosoever listeneth now findeth for him a dartin meteor in wait
  72,10,"And we know not whether evil is boded for those who are on the earth, or whether their Lord intendeth for them a right direction"
  72,11,"And of us there are some righteous, and of us are some otherwise; we have been following very diverse"
  72,12,"And we known that we cannot frustrate Allah in the earth, nor can we frustrate Him by flight"
  72,13,"And when we heard the Message of guidance, we believed therein; and whosoever believeth in his Lord, he shall fear neither diminution nor wrong"
