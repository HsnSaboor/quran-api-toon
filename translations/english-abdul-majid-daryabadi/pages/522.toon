  51,33,That we may send down upon them stones of baked clay
  51,34,"Marked, from before thy Lord, for extravagant"
  51,35,Thus We brought forth from there in who were believers
  51,36,And We found not therein more than one house of the Muslims
  51,37,And We left therein a sign for those who fear the afflictive torment
  51,38,"And in Musa also was a lesson, when We sent him Unto Fir'awn with authority manifest"
  51,39,"Then he turned away with his court, and said: a magician or a madman"
  51,40,"Then We laid hold of him and his hosts and flung them into the sea, and he was reproachable"
