quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,Recall what time his Lord called Unto him in the holy vale of Tuwa
  79,17,"Saying:'go thou Unto Fir'awn; verily he hath waxen exorbitant"
  79,18,"Then say thou: 'wouldst thou to be purified"
  79,19,Then shall guide thee Unto thy Lord so that thou shalt fear
  79,20,Then he shewed him the great sign
  79,21,Yet he belied and disobeyed
  79,22,Then he turned back striving
  79,23,Then he gathered and cried aloud
  79,24,"And he said: I am Your Lord, most high"
  79,25,Wherefore Allah laid hold of him with the punishment of the Hereafter and of the present
  79,26,Verily herein is lesson for him who feareth
  79,27,Are ye harder to create or the heaven which He hath builded
  79,28,He hath raised the height thereof and perfected it
  79,29,"And He made dark its night, and brought forth its sunshine"
  79,30,And the earth!- thereafter He stretched it out
  79,31,"And he brought forth therefrom its water, and its pasture"
  79,32,And the mountains! - He established them firm
  79,33,A provision for you and your cattle
  79,34,Then when the Grand Calamity shall come
  79,35,The Day whereon man shall rember whatsoever he had striven for
  79,36,And the Scorch will be made apparent to any one who beholdeth
  79,37,Then as for him who waxed exorbitant
  79,38,And who chose the life of the world
  79,39,Verily the Scorch! that shall be his resort
  79,40,"And as for him who dreaded standing before his Lord, and restrained his soul from lust"
  79,41,Verily the Garden! -that shall be his resort
  79,42,"They question thee of the Hour:'when will its arrival be"
  79,43,Wherein art thou concerred with the declaration thereof
  79,44,Unto thy Lord is the Knowledge of the limit fixed therefor
  79,45,Thou art but a warner Unto him who feareth
  79,46,"On the Day whereon they behold it, it will appear to them as though they had not tarried save an evening or the morn thereof"
