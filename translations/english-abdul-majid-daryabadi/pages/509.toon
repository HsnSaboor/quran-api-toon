quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"And those who believe say wherefore hath not a Surah been revealed? Then when there is sent down a Surah firmly constructed, and fighting is mentioned therein, thou seest those in whose hearts is a disease looking at thee with the look of one swooning Unto death. So also for them"
  47,21,"Their obedience and speech are known. Then when the affair is determined, if even then they gave credence Unto Allah, it would have been better for them"
  47,22,"Then, belike ye are, if ye turn to cause corruption in the earth away, and to sever your kinship"
  47,23,"Those are they whom Allah hath cursed, and then hath deafened them and blinded their sights"
  47,24,"Ponder then they not on the Qur'an, or are on the hearts locks thereof"
  47,25,"Verily those who have apostated on their backs after the guidance had become manifest Unto them, the devil hath embellished this apostacy for them and hath given them false hopes"
  47,26,"That is because they said Unto those who detest that which Allah hath revealed: we shall obey you in part of the affair; and Allah knoweth their talking in secret"
  47,27,How then shall it be when the angels shall take them away at death smiting their faces and their backs
  47,28,That is because they followed that which angered Allah and detested His good-will; so He made their works of non-effect
  47,29,Deem those in whose hearts is a disease that Allah will never bring to light their secret malevolence
