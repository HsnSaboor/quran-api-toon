quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"Who said: art thou of those who confess to the doctrine of Resurrection"
  37,53,"When we are dead and have become dust and bones, are we indeed going to be requited"
  37,54,"Allah will say: will ye look down"
  37,55,Then he will look down and see him in the midst of the Flaming Fire
  37,56,"And he will say: by Allah, thou hadst wellnigh causedest me to perish"
  37,57,"And but for the favourcf my lord, I should have been of those brought forward"
  37,58,Are we not then to die
  37,59,"Save our first death, and are we not to be tormented"
  37,60,Verily this! that is the supreme achievement
  37,61,"For the like of this, then, let the workers work"
  37,62,Is this better as an entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum
  37,63,Verily We! We have made it a temptation for the wrong- doers
  37,64,Verily it is a tree that springeth forth in the bottom of Flaming Fire
  37,65,The fruit thereof is as though the hoods of the serpents
  37,66,And verily they must eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith
  37,67,And thereafter verily they shall have thereon a draught of balling water
  37,68,And thereafter verily their return is Unto the Flaming Fire
  37,69,Verily they found their fathers gone astray
  37,70,So they in their footsteps are rushing
  37,71,And assuredly there went stray before them many of the ancients
  37,72,And assuredly We sent among them warners
  37,73,So behold what wise hath been the end of those who were warned
  37,74,Save the bondmen of Allah sincere
  37,75,And assuredly Nuh cried Unto us; and We are the Best of answerers
  37,76,And We delivered him and his people from the great affliction
