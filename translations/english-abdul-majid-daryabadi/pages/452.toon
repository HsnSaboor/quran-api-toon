quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What aileth you? How judge ye
  37,155,Will ye not then be admonished
  37,156,"Or, is there for you a clear warranty"
  37,157,"Then bring your book, if ye say sooth"
  37,158,And they have made a kinship between Him and the jinn a kinship whereas the jinn assuredly know that they are to be brought up
  37,159,Hallowed be Allah from that which they ascribe to Him
  37,160,Except the bondmen of Allah sincere
  37,161,Wherefore verily neither ye nor that which ye worship
  37,162,Can tempt anyone to rebel against Him
  37,163,Save him Who is to roast in the Flaming Fire
  37,164,Of us there is none but hath a station assigned
  37,165,And verily we! we are ranged in ranks
  37,166,And verily we! we halloW
  37,167,And they surely were wont to say
  37,168,Had we but an admonition as had the ancients
  37,169,Surefy we would have been the bondmen of God sincere
  37,170,Yet they disbelieve therein. Presently they shall come to know
  37,171,"And assuredly Our word hath already gone forth Our bondmen, the sent ones"
  37,172,That verily they! they shall be made triumphant
  37,173,And verily Our host! they are to be overcome
  37,174,So turn thou aside from them for a season
  37,175,And see them thou; they themselves shall presently see
  37,176,Our torment seek they to hasten on
  37,177,"Then when it descendeth Unto them face to, face, a hapless morn that shall be for those who were Warned"
  37,178,And turn thou aside from them for a season
  37,179,"And see thou: they themselves shall presently see"
  37,180,"Hallowed be thine Lord, the Lord of Majesty, from that which they ascribe"
  37,181,And peace be Unto the sent ones
  37,182,And all praise Unto Allah the Lord of the worlds
