quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,Verily for the God-fearing is an achievement
  78,32,Gardens enclosed and vineyards
  78,33,And full-breasted maidens of equal age
  78,34,And a cup overflowing
  78,35,They will hear therein no babble nor falsehood
  78,36,A recompense from thy Lord-a gift sufficient
  78,37,"From the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of whatsoever is in bet-ween them, the Compassionate with Whom they can demand not audience"
  78,38,"On the Day whereon the spirits and the angels will stand arrayed, they will not be able to speak save him whom the Compassionate giveth leave and who speaketh aright"
  78,39,"That is the Sure Day. Whosoever therefore willeth, let him betake Unto his Lord a resort"
  78,40,"Verily We! We have warned you of a torment nigh at hand, a Day whereon a man shall behold that which his hands have sent forth, and the infidel will say: would that I were dust"
  79,1,By the angels who drag forth vehemently
  79,2,By the angels who release with gentle release
  79,3,By the angels who glide swimmingiy
  79,4,And then they speed with foremost speed
  79,5,And then they manage the affair
  79,6,A Day shall come whereon the quaking will quake
  79,7,And there will follow it the next blast
  79,8,Hearts on that Day will be throbbing
  79,9,Their looks will be downcast
  79,10,"They say: shall we indeed be restored to the first state"
  79,11,When we have become bones decayed
  79,12,"They say: that then shall be a losing return"
  79,13,It will be only one scaring shout
  79,14,And lo! they all shall appear on the surface
  79,15,Hath there come Unto thee the story of Musa
