quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,But ye prefer the life of this world
  87,17,Whereas the Hereafter is better and more lasting
  87,18,Verily this is in Writs ancient
  87,19,Writs of Ibrahim and Musa
  88,1,Hath there come Unto thee the story of the Enveloping Event
  88,2,Faces on that Day shall be downcast
  88,3,"Travailing, worn"
  88,4,They shall roast into the scalding Fire
  88,5,Given to drink of a spring fiercely boiling
  88,6,No food shall be theirs save bitter thorn
  88,7,Which shall neither nourish nor avail against hunger
  88,8,Faces on that Day shall be de lighted
  88,9,With their endeavour well pleased
  88,10,They shall be in a Garden lofty
  88,11,They shall hear therein no vain discourse
  88,12,Therein shall be a spring running
  88,13,Therein shall be couches elevated
  88,14,And goblets ready placed
  88,15,And cushions ranged
  88,16,And carpets ready spread
  88,17,"Look they not at the camels, how they are created"
  88,18,"And at the heaven, how it is raised"
  88,19,"And at the mountains, how they are rooted"
  88,20,"And at the earth, how it is outspread"
  88,21,Admonish thou then; thou art but an admonisher
  88,22,Thou art not over them a warden
  88,23,But whosoever will turn back and disbelieve
  88,24,Him Allah shall torment with the greatest torment
  88,25,Verily Unto us is their reckoning
  88,26,Then verily on us is their reckoning
