quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,"And that He createth the pair, the male and the female"
  53,46,From seed when it is emitted
  53,47,And that upon Him is another bringing forth
  53,48,And that it is He Who enricheth and preserveth property
  53,49,And that it is He Who is the Lord of Sirius
  53,50,And that He destroyed the former 'A-ad
  53,51,And that Thamud! He left not
  53,52,And also the people of Nuh aforetime. Verily they were even greater wrong-doers and more contumacious
  53,53,And the subverted cities He overthrew
  53,54,Then covered them with that which covered them
  53,55,Which then of thy Lord's benefits wilt thou doubt
  53,56,This is a warner of the warners of old
  53,57,There hath approached the approaching Hour
  53,58,"None, except Allah, can avert it"
  53,59,At this discourse then marvel ye
  53,60,And laugh and not weep
  53,61,And ye are behaving proudly
  53,62,So prostrate yourselves before Allah and worship
  54,1,"The Hour hath drawn nigh, and the moon hath been rent in sunder.. And if they behold a sign, they turn away and say: magic continuous"
  54,2,"And if they behold a sign, they turn away and say: \"magic continous"
  54,3,"And they belied, and they followed their lusts; and every affair cometh to a final goal"
  54,4,And assuredly there hath come Unto them tidings wherein is a deterrent
  54,5,Wisdom consummate. But warnings avail not
  54,6,Wherefore withdrew thou from them. The Day whereon the sum- moner Will summon mankind Unto a thing unpleasant
