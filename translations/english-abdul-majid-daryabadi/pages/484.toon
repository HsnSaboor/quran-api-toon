quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  42,11,"The Creator of the heavens and the earth: He hath made for you mates of yourselves, and of the cattle also mates, whereby He diffuseth you. Not like Unto Him is aught, and He is the Hearer, the Beholder"

  42,14,"And they divided not until after knowledge had come to them, through spite between themselves; And had not a word gone forth from thy Lord for an appointed term, the affair would surely have been judged between them. And verily those who have been made inheritors of the Book after them are in doubt thereof dubitating"
  42,15,"Wherefore Unto that summon thou, and be steadfast as thou hast been commanded, and follow not their desires. And say thou: I believe in whatsoever Allah hath sent down of the Book, and I am commanded that I should do justice between you; Allah is our Lord and your Lord; Unto us our works, and Unto you your works; let there be no contention between us and you; Allah will assemble us, and Unto Him is the return"
