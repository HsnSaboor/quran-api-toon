quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,For the keeping of the Quraish
  106,2,For their keeping to the journey in the winter and the summer
  106,3,Let them worship the Lord of this House
  106,4,Who hath fed them against hunger; and hath rendered them secure from fear
  107,1,Beholdest thou him who belieth the Requital
  107,2,It is he who pusheth away the orphan
  107,3,And urgeth not the feeding of the poor
  107,4,"Woe, therefore, Unto such performers of prayer"
  107,5,As are of their prayer careless
  107,6,They who would be seen
  107,7,And who withholds even common necessaries
  108,1,Verily We! We have given thee Kauthar
  108,2,"Wherefore pray thou Unto thy Lord, and sacrifice"
  108,3,Verily it is thy traducer who shall be tail-less
