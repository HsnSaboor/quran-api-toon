quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,103,Then when the twain had submitted themselves and he had prostrated him upon his temple
  37,104,"We cried Unto him: O Ibrahim"
  37,105,Of a surety thou hast fulfilled the vision. Verily We! thus We recompense the well-doers
  37,106,Verily that! that was a trial manifest
  37,107,And We ransomed him with a mighty victim
  37,108,And We left for him among the posterity
  37,109,Peace be Unto Ibrahim
  37,110,Verily We! thus We compense the well-doers
  37,111,Verily he was one of Our believing bondmen
  37,112,"And We gave him the glad tidings of Is-haq, a prophet, and of the righteous"
  37,113,And We blessed him and Is-haq; and of their offspring are some well-doers and some who wrong themselves manifestly
  37,114,And assuredly We gave grace Unto Musa and Harun
  37,115,And delivered them and their people from the great affliction
  37,116,And We succoured them so that they became overcomers
  37,117,And We vouchsafed Unto the twain a Book luminous
  37,118,And We led the twain on Unto the straight path
  37,119,And We left for the twain among the posterity
  37,120,Peace be Unto Musa and Harun
  37,121,Verily We! thus We recompense the well-doers
  37,122,Verily the twain were of Our bondmen believing
  37,123,"And verily, llyas was one of the sent ones"
  37,124,"Recall what time he said Unto his people: fear ye not"
  37,125,Call ye upon Bal and forsake the Best of creators
  37,126,"Allah, your Lord and Lord of your forefathers"
