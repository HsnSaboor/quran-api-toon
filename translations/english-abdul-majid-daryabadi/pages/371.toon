quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,And appoint for me an honourable mention among the posterity
  26,85,And make me one of the inheritors of the Garden of Delight
  26,86,And forgive my father; verily he is of the erring
  26,87,And humiliate me not on the Day whereon people shall be raised
  26,88,The Day whereon will profit neither substance nor sons
  26,89,"Unless it be he, who shall bring unto Allah a whole heart"
  26,90,"And the Garden shall be brought nigh to the God, fearing"
  26,91,And the Fierce Fire shall be made apparent unto the seduced ones
  26,92,And it shall be said unto them where is that which ye were wont to worship
  26,93,Beside Allah? Can they succour you or succour themselves
  26,94,"Then they shall be hurled therein, they and the seduced ones"
  26,95,And the hosts of Iblis together
  26,96,"And they, While contending therein, shall say"
  26,97,"By Allah, we have indeed been in an error manifest"
  26,98,When we equalled you with the Lord of the worlds
  26,99,And none led us astray except the Culprits
  26,100,So none we have as intercessors
  26,101,Nor any loving friend
  26,102,"Were there for us a return, we would be of the believers"
  26,103,"Verily herein is a sign, but most of them are not believers"
  26,104,"And verily thy Lord! He is the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,105,And Nuh's people belied the sent ones
  26,106,"When their brother Nuh said Unto them: fear ye not"
  26,107,Verily I am unto you an apostle trusted
  26,108,So fear Allah and obey me
  26,109,And I ask of you no hire therefor; my hire is but with the Lord of the worlds
  26,110,So fear Allah and obey me
  26,111,"They said: shall We believe in thee when the meanest follow thee"
