  28,60,And whatsoever ye are vouchsafed is an enjoyment of the life of the world and an adornment thereof; and that which is with Allah is better and more lasting. Will ye not therefore reflect
  28,61,"Is he, then, whom We have promised an excellent promise which he is going to meet, like unto him whom We have suffered to enjoy awhile the enjoyment of the life of the world, then on the Day of Resurrection he shall be of those brought up"
  28,62,"And on the Day whereon He shall call unto them and say: where are My associates whom ye were wont to assert"
  28,63,"Those upon whom the sentence will be pronounced will say: our Lord these are they whom we seduced, we seduced them even as we our selves were seduced. We declare ourselves quit of them before Thee; not our selves they were wont to worship"
  28,64,"And it shall be said: Call upon your associate-gods. And they shall call upon them, and they shall not answer them, and they shall behold the torment. Would that they had received the guidance"
  28,65,"And on the Day whereon He shall call unto them and say: what answer gave ye to the sent ones"
  28,66,"Bedimmed unto them shall be all excuses on that Day, wherefore they shall not be able to ask one of another"

  28,68,And thy lord createth whatsoever He listeth and chooseth; no Choice is to be far them. Hallowed be Allah and exalted above that which they associate
  28,69,And thy Lord knoweth that which their breasts conceal and that which they make known
  28,70,"And He is Allah there is no god but he! His is all praise in the first and in the last, and His is the command, and unto Him ye shall be returned"
