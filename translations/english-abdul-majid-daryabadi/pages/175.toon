quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"Say thou: I possess no power over benefit or hurt to myself save as Allah willeth; and had I knowledge of the unseen I would have amassed ample good, and evil would not have touched me. I am naught but a warner and a bringer of tidings unto a people who believe"
  7,189,"He it is who created you from a single soul, and He created therefrom his spouse that he might find repose in her. Then when he covereth her she beareth a light burthen and fareth about there with; then when she groweth heavy the twain call upon Allah their Lord: if Thou vouchsafest us a goodly Child, we shall surely be of the thankful"
  7,190,But when He vouchsafeth the twain a goodly child they set up unto Him associates in respect of that which He hath vouchsafed to them. Exalted be Allah far from that which they associate
  7,191,Associate they those who cannot create aught and are created
  7,192,"And who cannot succour them, nor can succour themselves"
  7,193,"And if ye call them toward guidance they follow you not: it is the same to you whether ye call them or are silent"
  7,194,"Verily those whom ye call upon beside Allah are creatures like unto you; so call on them, and let them answer you if ye say sooth"
  7,195,"Have they feet wherewith they wend? Have they hands wherewith they grip? Have they eyes wherewith they see? Have they ears wherewith they hearken? Say thou: call upon your associate gods, and then plot against me and respite me not"
