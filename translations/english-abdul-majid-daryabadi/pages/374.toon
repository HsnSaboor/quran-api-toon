quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,The people of Lut belied the sent ones
  26,161,"When their brother Lut said unto them: fear ye not"
  26,162,Verily I am unto you an apostle trusted
  26,163,"So fear Allah, and obey me"
  26,164,And I ask of you no hire there for; my hire is but with the Lord of the worlds
  26,165,"Go ye in, of all creatures, unto the males"
  26,166,And leave ye your spouses your Lord hath created for you? Aye! ye are a people trespassing
  26,167,"They said: if thou desistest not, O Lut! thou shalt surely be of those driven forth"
  26,168,"He said: verily I am of those who abhor your work"
  26,169,My Lord! deliver me and my household from that which they work
  26,170,So We delivered him and his household all
  26,171,Save an old woman among the lingerers
  26,172,Thereafter We annihilated the rest
  26,173,And We rained on them a rain. So ill was the rain on those warned
  26,174,"Verily herein is a sign, yet most of them are not believers"
  26,175,"And verily thy Lord! He is the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,176,The dwellers of the wood belied the sent ones
  26,177,"What time Shu'aib, said unto them: fear ye not"
  26,178,Verily I am unto you an apostle trusted
  26,179,"So fear Allah, and obey me"
  26,180,And ask of you no hire therefor; and my hire is but with the Lord of the worlds
  26,181,"Give full measure, and be not of those who cause others to lose"
  26,182,And weigh with a balance straight
  26,183,"And defraud not people of their things, and commit not corruption on the earth"
