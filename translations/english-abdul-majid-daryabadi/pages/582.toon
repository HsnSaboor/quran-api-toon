quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,Of what ask they
  78,2,Of the mighty Announcement
  78,3,Concerning which they differ
  78,4,By no means! anon they shall know
  78,5,"Again, by no means! anon they shall know"
  78,6,Have We not made the earth an expanse
  78,7,And the mountains as stakes
  78,8,And We have created you in pairs
  78,9,And We have made your sleep as a rest
  78,10,And We have made the night a covering
  78,11,And We have made the day for seeking livelihood
  78,12,And We have builded over you seven strong heavens
  78,13,And We have set therein lamps glowing
  78,14,And We have sent down from the rain-clouds water plenteous
  78,15,So that We bring forth thereby corn and vegetation
  78,16,And gardens thick with trees
  78,17,Verily the Day of Decision is a time appointed
  78,18,"It is a Day whereon the trumpet will be blown, and ye will come in multitudes"
  78,19,"And the heaven will have been opened, and it will have become doors"
  78,20,"And the mountains will have been removed away, and they will have become as mirage"
  78,21,Verily the Hell is an ambuscade
  78,22,For the exorbitant a receptacle
  78,23,They will tarry therein for ages
  78,24,They will not taste therein cool or any drink
  78,25,Save scalding water and corruption
  78,26,Recompense fitted
  78,27,Verily they were wont not to look for a reckoning
  78,28,And they belied Our revelations with strong belying
  78,29,And everything We have recorded in a book
  78,30,Taste therefore. We shall not increase you in aught but torment
