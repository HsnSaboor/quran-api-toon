quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"Then they belied him, so verily they are to be brought up"
  37,128,Except the bondmen of Allah sincere
  37,129,And We left for him among the posterity
  37,130,Peace be Unto Elyasin
  37,131,Verily We! thus We recompense the well-doers
  37,132,Verily he was one of Our bondmen believing
  37,133,And verily Lut was of the sent ones
  37,134,"Recall what time We delivered him and his household, all"
  37,135,Save an old woman among the lingerers
  37,136,Then We annihilated the others
  37,137,And surely ye pass by them in the morning
  37,138,And at night. Will ye not therefore reflect
  37,139,And verily Yunus was Of the sent ones
  37,140,Recall what time he ran away Unto a laden ship
  37,141,"Then he joined the lots, and was of the condemned"
  37,142,"And a fish swallowed him, and he was reproaching himself"
  37,143,And had he not been of those who hallow Him
  37,144,He would have tarried in the belly thereof till the Day when they are raised
  37,145,Then We cast him on a bare desert whilst he was sick
  37,146,"And We caused to grow over him a tree, a gourd"
  37,147,"And We had sent him to a hundred thousand: rather they exceeded"
  37,148,"And they believed, whrefore We let them enjoy life for a season"
  37,149,"Now ask thou them: there for thy Lord daughters and for them sons"
  37,150,Or created We the angels females while they were witnesses
  37,151,Lo! verily it is of their falsehood that they say
  37,152,God hath begotten. Verily they are the liars
  37,153,Hath He chosen daughters above sons
