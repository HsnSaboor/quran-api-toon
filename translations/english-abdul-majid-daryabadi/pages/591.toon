quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the heaven and the night-comer
  86,2,And what shall make thee know that which the night-comer is
  86,3,It is the star shing brightly
  86,4,No soul is there but hath over it a watcher
  86,5,So let man look - from what is he created
  86,6,He is created from a water drip-ping
  86,7,That issueth from between the loins and the breast-bones
  86,8,Verily He is Able to restore him
  86,9,On a Day whereon secrets shall be out
  86,10,Then he shall have no power nor any helper
  86,11,By the heaven which returneth
  86,12,And by the earth which splitteth

  86,14,And it is not a frivolity
  86,15,Verily they are plotting a plot
  86,16,And I am plotting a plot
  86,17,So respite thou the infidels - respite them gently
  87,1,"Hallow thou the name of thine Lord, the Most High"

  87,4,And Who bringeth forth the pasturage
  87,5,Then maketh it to stubble dusky
  87,6,"We shall enable thee to recite, and then thou shalt not forget"
  87,7,Save that which Allah may will. Verily He knoweth the public and that which is hidden
  87,8,And We shall make easy Unto thee the easy way
  87,9,Wherefore admonish thou; admonition hath surely profited
  87,10,Admonished is he indeed who feareth
  87,11,And the wretched shunneth it
  87,12,He Who shall roast into the Great Fire
  87,13,Wherein he shall neither die nor live
  87,14,He indeed hath attained bliss who hath cleansed himself
  87,15,"And who remembereth the name of his Lord, and then prayeth"
