  104,2,Who amasseth wealth; and counteth it
  104,3,He bethinketh that his wealth shall abide for him

  104,8,Verily it shall close upon them
  104,9,In pillars stretched forth
  105,1,Hast thou not observed what wise thy Lord dealt with the fellows of the elephant
  105,2,Put He not their stratagem to straying
  105,3,And He sent against them birds in flocks
  105,4,They hurled upon them stones of baked clay
  105,5,Then He rendered them as stubble devoured
