quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star when it setteth
  53,2,"Your companion hath not gone astray, nor hath he erred"
  53,3,And he speaketh not of his own desire
  53,4,It is but a revelation revealed
  53,5,One of mighty powers hath taught it him
  53,6,One strong of make. Then he stood straight
  53,7,While he was on the uppermost horizon
  53,8,"Thereafter he drew nigh, then he let himself down"
  53,9,Till he was two bows length off or yet nearer
  53,10,Thus He revealed Unto His bondman whatsoever He revealed
  53,11,The heart lied not in that which he saw
  53,12,Will ye therefore dispute with him concerning that which he hath Seen
  53,13,And assuredly he saw him at another descent
  53,14,Nigh Unto the lote-tree at the boundary
  53,15,Nigh thereto is the Garden of Abode
  53,16,When that covered the lote-tree which covered it
  53,17,"The sight turned not aside, nor it exceeded"
  53,18,"Assuredly he beheld of the sign of his Lord, the greatest"
  53,19,Have ye then considered Al-Lat and AL-'uzza
  53,20,And Manat the other third
  53,21,What!-Unto YOu the males and Unto Him the females
  53,22,That indeed is a division unfair
  53,23,"They are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which Allah hath sent down no authority. They follow but their fancy, and that which pleaseth their souls; whereas assuredly there hath come Unto them from their Lord the guidance"
  53,24,Shall man have whatsoever he wisheth for
  53,25,Allah's is the last and the first
  53,26,And many soever are angels in the heavens whose intercession shall not avail at all save after Allah hath given leave for whomsoever He listeth and pleaseth
