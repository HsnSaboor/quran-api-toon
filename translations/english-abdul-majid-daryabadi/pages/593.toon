quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the dawn
  89,2,And by ten nights
  89,3,And by the even and the odd
  89,4,And by the night when it departeth
  89,5,Indeed in that there is an oath for a man of sense
  89,6,Bethinkest thou not in what wise thy Lord did with the 'A'ad
  89,7,The people of many-columned lram
  89,8,The like of which was not built in the cities
  89,9,And With Thamud who hewed out rocks in the vale
  89,10,"And with Fir'awn, owner of the stakes"
  89,11,Who all waxed exorbitant in the cities
  89,12,And multiplied therein corruption
  89,13,Wherefore thy Lord poured on them the scourge of His torment
  89,14,Verily thy Lord is in an ambuscade
  89,15,"As for man - when his Lord proveth him and so honoureth him and is bounteous Unto him, then he saith: 'my Lord hath honoured me"
  89,16,"And when He proveth him, and so stinteth Unto him his provision, he saith: 'my Lord hath despised me"
  89,17,By no means! But ye honour not the orphan
  89,18,Nor urge upon each other the feeding of the poor
  89,19,And devour the inheritance devouring greedily
  89,20,And ye love riches with exceeding love
  89,21,"By no means! when the earth shall be ground with grinding, grinding"
  89,22,"And thy Lord shall come and the angels, rank on rank"
  89,23,"And the Hell on that Day shall be brought nigh. On that Day man shall remember, but how will remembrance avail him"
