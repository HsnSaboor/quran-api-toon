  36,13,"And propound thou Unto them the similitude of the inhabitants of a town, When there came thereto the sent ones"
  36,14,"What time We sent Unto them two, then they belied the twain, wherefore We strengthened them with a third, and they said: verily we are Unto you the sent ones"
  36,15,"They said: ye are but human beings like ourselves; the Compassionate hath not sent down aught; ye are only lying"
  36,16,"They said: our Lord knoweth that we are surely Unto you the sent ones"
  36,17,And on us is naught but manifest preaching
  36,18,"They said: verily we augur ill of you; if ye desist not, we shall surely stone you, and there will befall you from us a torment afflictive"
  36,19,"They said: your evil augury be with you. Call ye it an ill- luck because ye are admonished! Aye! ye are a people extravagant"

  36,24,Verily then I should be in error manifest
  36,25,Verily I believe now in your Lord; so hearken Unto me
  36,26,"It was said: enter thou the Garden. He said: would that my people knew"
  36,27,"That my Lord hath forgiven me, and hath made me of the honoured ones"
