quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  68,16,Anon We shall brand him on snout
  68,17,Verily We! We have proved them even as We proved the fellows of a garden when they swarethat they would surely reap it in the morning
  68,18,And they made not the exception
  68,19,Wherefore an encircling visitation visited it even as they slept on
  68,20,Then in the morning it became as though it had been reaped
  68,21,Then they cried out Unto each other in the morning
  68,22,"Saying: go out betimes to your tilth if ye would reap"
  68,23,So they went off speaking to each other in a low voice
  68,24,Let there not enter upon you today any needy man
  68,25,And they went out betimes determined in purpose
  68,26,"Then when they beheld it, they said: verily we have strayed"
  68,27,Aye! it is we who are deprived
  68,28,"The most moderate of them said: said I not Unto you, wherefore hallow him ye not"
  68,29,"They said: hallowed be Our Lord! verily we have been wrong- doers"
  68,30,Then they turned to each other reproaching
  68,31,"They said: woe Unto us! verily we! we have been arrogant"
  68,32,Belike our Lord may exchange for us better garden than this; verily we are Unto our Lord beseechers
  68,33,Such is the torment. And the torment of the Hereafter is far greater; if they but knew
  68,34,"Verily for the God-fearing, are with their Lord Gardens of Delight"
  68,35,Shall We then make the Muslims like the culprits
  68,36,What aileth you? How ill ye judge
  68,37,Is there with you a Book wherein ye study
  68,38,That therein is yours that which. ye may choose
  68,39,"Or have ye oaths from us reaching to the Day of Resurrection, that you shall be that which ye judge"
  68,40,"Ask then, which of them will stand thereof a surety"
  68,41,Have they associate gods? Then let them produce their associate gods if they say sooth
  68,42,"Remember the Day whereon the shank shall be bared and they shall be called upon to Prostrate themselves, but they shall not be able"
