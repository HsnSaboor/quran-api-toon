  75,21,And leave the Hereafter

  76,2,"Verily We! We created man from a sperm of mixtures, that We might prove him, wherefore We made him hearing, seeing"
  76,3,Verily We! We shewed him the way; then he becometh either thankful or ingrate
  76,4,Verily We! We have gotten ready for the infidels chains and collars and a Blaze
  76,5,Verily the pious shall drink of a cup whereof the admixture is like Unto camphor
