quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,"And of us some are Muslims, and of us some are deviators. Then whosoever hath embraced Islam - such have endeavoured after a Path of rectitude"
  72,15,"And as for the deviators, for Hell they shall be fuel"
  72,16,And had they kept to the path surely We would have watered them with rain plenteous
  72,17,"That We might try them there by. And whosoever turneth aside from the remembrance of his Lord, him He shall thrust into a torment vehement"
  72,18,And the prostrations are for Allah; wherefore call not along with Allah anyone
  72,19,"And when the bondman of Allah stood calling upon Him, they well nigh pressed on him stifling"
  72,20,"Say thou: I simply call upon Allah, and I associate not with Him any-one"
  72,21,"Say thou: 'verily own not for you power of hurt nor of benefit"
  72,22,"Say thou: 'verily none can protect me from Allah, nor can I find beside Him any refuge"
  72,23,"Mine is but the publishing from Allah and His messages; and whosoever disobeyeth Allah and His apostle, his portion verily is the Hell-Fire as abiders therein for evermore"
  72,24,They shall go on denying until they; behold that which they are promised wherefore then they shall know who were weaker in protectors and fewer in number
  72,25,"Say thou: know not whather that which ye are promised is nigh, or whether my Lord hath appointed for it a distant term"
  72,26,"He is the Knower of the unseen, and He discloseth not His unseen Unto anyone"
  72,27,Save Unto an apostle chosen. And then He causeth to go before him and behind him a guard
  72,28,"That He may know that they have preached the message of their Lord. And He comprehendeth whatever is with them, and He keepeth count of everything numbered"
