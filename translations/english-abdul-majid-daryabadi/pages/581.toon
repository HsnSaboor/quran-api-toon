quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Created We you not of water despicable
  77,21,Which We placed in a depository safe
  77,22,Till a limit known
  77,23,So We decreed. How excellent are We as decreers
  77,24,Woe on that day Unto the beliers
  77,25,Have We not made the earth a receptacle
  77,26,Both for the living and the dead
  77,27,And have placed therein firm and tall mountains and given you to drink of water fresh
  77,28,Woe on that day Unto the beliers
  77,29,Depart Unto that which ye were wont to belie
  77,30,Depart Unto the shadow three branched
  77,31,Neither shading nor availing against the flame
  77,32,Verily it shall cast forth sparks like Unto a castle
  77,33,As though they were camels yellow tawny
  77,34,Woe on that day Unto the beliers
  77,35,This is a Day whereon they shall not be able to speak
  77,36,Nor shall they be permitted so that they might excuse themselves
  77,37,Woe on that day Unto the beliers
  77,38,"This is the Day of Decision, We have assembled both ye and the ancients"
  77,39,"If now ye have any craft, try that craft upon Me"
  77,40,Woe on the day Unto the beliers
  77,41,Verily the God-fearing shall be amid shades and springs
  77,42,And fruits such as they shall desire
  77,43,Eat and drink with relish that which ye have been working
  77,44,Verily We! in this wise We recompense the well-doers
  77,45,Woe on that day Unto the beliers
  77,46,Eat and enjoy a little; verily ye are culprits
  77,47,Woe on that day Unto the beliers
  77,48,"And when it is said Unto them: 'bow down, they bow not down"
  77,49,Woe on that day Unto the beliers
  77,50,"In what discourse, then, after it, will they believe"
