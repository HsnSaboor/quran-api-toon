quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,135,"And they say: become Jews or Nazarenes, and ye shall be guided. Say thou: Aye! we follow the faith of Ibrahim, the upright, and he was not of the associators"
  2,136,"Say: we believe in Allah and that which hath been sent down unto us and that which was sent down unto Ibrahim and Ismai'l and Ishaq and Ya'qub and the tribes, and that which was vouchsafed unto Musa and lsa, and that which was vouchsafed unto the prophets from their Lord; we differentiate not between any of them, and unto Him are submissive"
  2,137,"So if they believe in the like of that which ye believe in, surely they are guided; but if they turn away, then they are but in Cleavage. So Allah will suffice thee against them and He is the Hearer, the Knower"
  2,138,Ours is the dye of Allah! and who is better at dyeing than Allah! And we are His worshippers
  2,139,"Say thou: contend ye with us regarding Allah, whereas He is our Lord even as He is Your Lord And unto us our works, and unto you your works, and we are His devotees"
  2,140,"Or say ye that Ibrahim and Ismai'l and Ishaq and Ya'qub, and the tribes were Jews or Nazarenes? Say thou: are ye the more knowing or is Allah? And who is more unjust than he who hideth a testimony that is with him from Allah? And Allah is not neglectful of that which ye Work"
  2,141,"That are a community who have passed away; unto them shall be that which they earned, and unto you that which ye earn; and ye shall be questioned not of that which they were wont to Work"
