quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  54,7,"With looks downcast they will come forth, from the tombs, as though they were locusts scattered abroad"
  54,8,"Hastening toward the summoner. The infidels will say: this is a day diffrcult"
  54,9,"There belied before them the people of Nuh. So they belied Our bondman Nuh and said: `a madman;' and moreover he was reproven"
  54,10,"Thereupon he prayed Unto his Lord: verily am overcome, so vindicate me"
  54,11,Then We opened the portals of heaven with water poured out
  54,12,And We made the earth break forth with springs; SO that the water met for an affair already decreed
  54,13,And We bare him on a thing of planks and nails
  54,14,"Moving forward under Our eyes: a requital for him who had been rejected"
  54,15,And assuredly We left it for a sign. Is there then anyone who would be admonished
  54,16,So how dreadful have been My torment and My warning
  54,17,And assuredly We have made the Qur'an easy for admonition; is there then any one who would be admonished
  54,18,And there belied the 'A-ad; so how dreadful have been My torment and warning
  54,19,Verily We! We sent against them a raging Wind On a day of calamity continuous
  54,20,Carrying men away as though they were trunks of palm-trees uprooted
  54,21,So how dreodful have been My torment and My warning
  54,22,And assuredly We have made the Qur'an easy for admonition; is therethen any one who would be admonished
  54,23,And the Thamud belied the warnings
  54,24,"And they said: a mere humanbeing from amongst us, and single! shall we follow him! verily then we should fall in error and madness"
  54,25,Hath the Admonition been laid upon him from amongst us! Aye! he is a liar insolent
  54,26,They shall know tomorrow whichsoever is a liar insolent
  54,27,"Verify We are sending the she-camel as a test for them, so watch them thou and have patience"
