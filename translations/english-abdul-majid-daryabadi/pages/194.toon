quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,41,"March forth light and heavy and strive hard with your riches and your lives in the way of Allah; that is the best for you, if ye have knowledge"
  9,42,"Were there a gear nigh and a journey moderate, they would have surely followed thee, but the distance seemed far unto them.

  9,43,Allah pardon thee! why didst thou give them leave before it was manifest unto thee as to whosoever told the truth and thou hadst known the liars
  9,44,Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day would not ask thy leave to be excused from striving hard with their riches and their lives; and Allah is Knower of the God-fearing
  9,45,"It is only those who believe not in Allah and the Last Day and whose hearts doubt who ask thy leave, so in their doubt they are tossed to and fro"
  9,46,"And had they intended the going forth, they would have made some preparation therefor; But Allah was averse to their wending, wherefore He withheld them, and the word was passed: stay of home with the stay-at-homes"
  9,47,"Had they gene forth with you, they would have added unto you naught save unsoundness, and they would surely have hurried about in Your midst seeking sedition unto you; and amongst you there are listeners to them; and Allah is Knower of the wrong-doers"
