quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and his morning bright-ness
  91,2,"By the moon, when she followeth him"
  91,3,By the day when it glorifieth him
  91,4,By the night; when it envelopeth him
  91,5,By the heaven and Him Who builded it
  91,6,By the earth and Him Who spread it forth
  91,7,By the soul and Him Who propertioned it
  91,8,And inspired it with the wickedness thereof and the piety thereof
  91,9,"Surely blissful is he who hath cleansed, it"
  91,10,And miserable is he who hath buried it
  91,11,Thamud belied in their exorbitance
  91,12,What time the greatest wretch of them rose up

  91,14,"Then they belied him, and they hamstrung her; wherefore their Lord overwhelmed them for their crime, and made it equal"
  91,15,And He feared not the consequence thereof
  92,1,By the night when it envelopeth
  92,2,By the day when it appeareth in glory
  92,3,By Him Who hath created the male and the female

  92,7,Unto him therefore We shall indeed make easy the path to ease
  92,8,And as for him who stinteth and is heedless
  92,9,And who belieth the Good
  92,10,Unto him therefore We shall Indeed make easy the path to hardship
  92,11,And his substance will avail him not when he perisheth
  92,12,Verify on us is the guidance
  92,13,And verify Ours is both the Hereafter and the life present
  92,14,Wherefore have warned you of Fire flaming
