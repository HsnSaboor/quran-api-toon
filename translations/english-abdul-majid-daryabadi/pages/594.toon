quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  89,24,He will say. 'would that I had sent before for this life of mine
  89,25,Wherefore on that Day none shall torment with His torment
  89,26,Nor shall any bind with His bond
  89,27,O thou peaceful soul
  89,28,Return Unto thine Lord well pleased and well-pleasing
  89,29,Enter thou among My righteous bondmen
  89,30,And enter thou My Garden
  90,1,I swear by yonder city
  90,2,And thou shalt be allowed in yonder city
  90,3,And by the begetter and that which he begat
  90,4,Assuredly We have created man in trouble
  90,5,Deemest he that none will overpower him
  90,6,"He saith: 'I have wasted riches plenteous"
  90,7,Deemest he that none beholdeth him
  90,8,"Have We not, made for him two eyes"
  90,9,And a tongue and two lips
  90,10,And shown Unto him the two highways
  90,11,Yet he attempteth not the steep
  90,12,And what shall make thee understand that which the steep is
  90,13,It is freeing the neck
  90,14,"Or, feeding, in a day of privation"
  90,15,"An orphan, of kin"
  90,16,Or a poor man cleaving to the dust
  90,17,Then he became of those who believed and enjoined on each other steadfastness and enjoined on each other compassion
  90,18,These are the fellows of the righthand
  90,19,And those who disbelieve Our signs - they are the fellows of the lefthand
  90,20,Over them shall be Fire closing round
