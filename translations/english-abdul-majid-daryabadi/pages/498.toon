  44,40,Verily the Day of Distinction is the term appointed for all of them
  44,41,"A Day whereon a friend shall not avail a friend at all, nor shall they be helped"

  44,43,Verily the tree of Zaqqum
  44,44,Food of the sinner
  44,45,Like the dregs of all! It shall seethe in the bellies
  44,46,As the seething of boiling water
  44,47,"Lay hold of him, and drag him Unto the midst of the Flaming Fire"
  44,48,Then pour upon his head the torment of balling water
  44,49,"Taste thou! thou art indeed mighty, honoured"
  44,50,Verily this is that whereof ye were wont to doubt
  44,51,Verily the God-fearing will be in a place secure
  44,52,Amidst gardens and springs
  44,53,"Attired in fine silk and brocade, facing each other"

  44,56,"They will not taste death therein, except the first death; and He will preserve them from the torment of the Flaming Fire"
  44,57,A bounty from thy Lord. That! that is the supreme achievement
  44,58,And We have made it easy in thy language; they might haply be admonished
  44,59,Wait thou then; verily they also are waiting
