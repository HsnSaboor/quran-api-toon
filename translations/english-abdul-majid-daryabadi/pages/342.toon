quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,Blissful are the believers
  23,2,Those who in their prayer are lowly
  23,3,And those who from everything vain turn away
  23,4,And those who for the sake of purification are doers
  23,5,And those who of their private Parts are guards
  23,6,"Save in regard to their spouses and those whom their right hands own: so they are not blameworthy"
  23,7,"And Whosoever seeketh beyond that, then it is these who are the transgressors"
  23,8,And those who of their trusts and covenant are keepers
  23,9,And those who of their prayers are observant
  23,10,These! they are the inheritors
  23,11,Who shall inherit Paradise; therein they shall be abiders
  23,12,And assuredly We created man of an extract of clay
  23,13,Thereafter We made him of a Sperm In a receptacle safe
  23,14,"Thereafter We created the sperm a clot; then We created the clot a lump of flesh; then We created the lump of flesh bones; then We clothed the bones with flesh: thereafter We brought him forth as anot her creature. Blest then be Allah, the Best of creators"
  23,15,"Then verily, thereafter, ye are sure to die"
  23,16,Then verily on the Day of Judgment ye shall be raised up
  23,17,"And assuredly We created above you seven paths, and of the creation We have not been neglectful"
