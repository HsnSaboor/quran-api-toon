quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"Those who devour Usury Shall not be able to stand except standeth one whom the Satan hath confounded with his touch. That shall be because they say: bargaining is but as usury whereas Allah hath allowed bargaining and hath forbidden usury. Wherefore Unto whomsoever an exhortation cometh from his Lord, and he desisteth, his is that which is past, and his affair is with Allah. And whosoever returnoth --such shall be the fellows of the Fire, therein they shall be abiders"
  2,276,"Allah obliterateth usury, and increaseth the alms. And Allah loveth not any ingrate sinner"
  2,277,"Verily those who believe and work righteous works and establish prayer and give the Poor-rate, theirs shall be their hire with their Lord: no fear shall come on them nor shall they grieve"
  2,278,"O O Ye who believe: fear Allah and leave that which remainoth of usury if ye are believers"
  2,279,"But if ye will do it not, then be apprised of war from Allah and His apostle. And if ye repent, then yours shall be your capital sums; ye shall neither wrong nor be wronged"
  2,280,"And if one be in difficulties, then let there be and deferment until easiness. But if ye forego, it were better for you if ye knew"
  2,281,"And fear the Day whereon ye shall be brought back unto Allah, then shall each sour be repaid, in full that which he hath earned, and they shall not be wronged"
