quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,Wherefore for him here this Day there is no friend
  69,36,Nor any food save filthy corruption
  69,37,None shall eat it but the sinners
  69,38,I swear by that which ye see
  69,39,And that which ye see not
  69,40,That it is surely the speech brought by messenger honourable
  69,41,And it is not the speech of a poet. Little it is that ye believe
  69,42,Nor is it the speech of a sooth- sayer. Little are ye admonished
  69,43,It is a Revelation from the Lord of the worlds
  69,44,And if he had forged concerning us some discourses
  69,45,We surely had lain hold of him by the right hand
  69,46,And then severed his life-vein
  69,47,And not one of you would have withheld us from punishing him
  69,48,And verily it is an Admonition Unto the God-fearing
  69,49,And verily We! We know that some among you are beliers thereof
  69,50,And verily it shall be an occasion of anguish Unto the infidels
  69,51,And verily it is the truth of assured certainty
  69,52,"Wherefore hallow thou the name of thy Lord, the Mighty"
  70,1,There hath asked an asker for the torment about to befall
  70,2,"The infidels, of which there is no averter"
  70,3,"From Allah, Owner of the ascending steps"
  70,4,"Whereby the angels ascend Unto Him and also the spirit, On a Day whereof the measure is fifty thousand years"
  70,5,Wherefore be thou patient with a becoming patience
  70,6,Verily they behold it afar off
  70,7,And We behold it nigh
  70,8,It shall befall on a Day whereon the heaven shall become like Unto dregs of oil
  70,9,And then the mountains shall become like Unto wool dyed
  70,10,And not a friend shall ask a friend
