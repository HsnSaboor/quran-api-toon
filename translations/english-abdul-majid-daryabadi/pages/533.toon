  55,41,"The culprits will be recognised by their marks, and will be lain hold of by the forelocks and the feet"
  55,42,"Which, then, of the benefits of your Lord will ye twain belie"
  55,43,Yonder is the Hell which the culprits belied
  55,44,Going round between it and balling water fierce
  55,45,"Which, then, of the benefits of your Lord will ye twain belie"
  55,46,And for him who dreadeth the standing before his Lord will be two Gardens
  55,47,"Which, then, of the benefits of your Lord will ye twain belie"
  55,48,With spreading branches
  55,49,"Which, then, of the benefits of your Lord will ye twain belie"
  55,50,"In which, will be two fountains running"
  55,51,"Which, then, of the benefits of your Lord will ye twain belie"
  55,52,In which will be of every fruit two kinds
  55,53,"Which, then, of the benefits of your Lord will ye twain belie"
  55,54,Reclining on carpets whereof the linings will be of brocade; and the fruit of the two Gardens shall be near at hand
  55,55,"Which, then, of the benefits of your Lord will ye twain belie"
  55,56,Therein shall be those of refraining looks whom before them hath deflowered neither man nor jinn
  55,57,"Which, then, of the benefits of Your Lord will ye twain belie"

  55,60,Shall the recompense of kindness be aught save kindness
  55,61,"Which, then, of the benefits of your Lord will ye twain belie"
  55,62,And beside the two there will be two other Gardens
  55,63,"Which, then, of the benefits of your Lord will ye twain beli"
  55,64,Dark-green
  55,65,"Which, then, of the benefits of your Lord will ye twain belie"
  55,66,In which will be two fountains gushing forth
  55,67,"Which, then, of the benefits of your Lord will ye twain belie"
