quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,152,"And approach not the substance of an orphan save with that which is best until he attaineth his age of strength, and fill up the measure and balance with equity- We burthen not a soul except according to its capacity and when ye speak, be fair, even though it be against a kinsman; and the covenant of Allah fulfil. Thus He enjoineth you that haply ye may be admonished"
  6,153,"And that: verily this is my path, straight; follow it then, and follow not other ways; that will deviate you from His way. Thus He enjoineth you, that haply ye may fear God"
  6,154,"Then unto Musa We vouchsafed the Book perfect for him who would do well and detailing every thing and a guidance and a mercy, that haply in the meeting of their Lord they would believe"
  6,155,"And this is a Book We have sent down, blest, follow it then and fear God, haply ye may be shewn mercy"
  6,156,"Lest ye should say: the Book was only sent down to the two sects before us, and we in sooth were unaware of their readings"
  6,157,"Or lest ye should say. if only the Book had been sent down to us, we should surely have been better guided than they. So now surely there hath come unto you an evidence from Your Lord and a guidance and a mercy. Who then doth greater wrong than he who belieth the signs of Allah and shunneth them? Anon We will requite those who shun Our signs with an evil torment in as much as they were wont to shun them"
