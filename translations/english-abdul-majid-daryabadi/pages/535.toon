quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,There shall go round Unto them youths ever-young
  56,18,With goblets and ewers and a cup of limpid drink
  56,19,Whereby there shall be neither headiness nor will they be inebriated
  56,20,And with fruit from that which they choose
  56,21,And with flesh of fowls from that Which they desire
  56,22,And there will be fair ones large eyed
  56,23,The likes Unto pearls hidden
  56,24,A recompense for that which they have been working
  56,25,Therein they hear no vain or sinful discourse
  56,26,"Nought but the saying: peace! peace"
  56,27,And the fellows on the right hand; how be happy shall the fellows on the right hand be
  56,28,Midst lote-trees thornless
  56,29,And plantains laden with fruit
  56,30,And a shade ever-spread
  56,31,And water everflowing
  56,32,And fruit abundant
  56,33,Neither ending nor forbidden
  56,34,And carpets raised
  56,35,Verily We! We have created those maidens by a creation
  56,36,And have made them virgins
  56,37,"Loving, of equal age"
  56,38,For the fellows on the right hand
  56,39,A multitude from the ancients
  56,40,And a multitude from the later generations
  56,41,And the fellows on the left hand; how miserable Shall the fellows on the left hand be
  56,42,Amidst scorching wind and scalding water
  56,43,And the shade of black smoke
  56,44,Neither cool nor pleasant
  56,45,Verily they have been heretofore affluent
  56,46,And they have been persisting in the heinous offence
  56,47,"And they were wont to say: when we have died and become dust and bones, shall we, then, verily be raised"
  56,48,We and our fathers of old
  56,49,"Say thou: verily the ancients and those of later generations"
  56,50,Are going to be assembled on the appointed time of a Day Known
