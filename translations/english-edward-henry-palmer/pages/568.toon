quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,therefore he has not here today any warm friend
  69,36,nor any food except foul ichor
  69,37,which none save sinners shall eat
  69,38,I need not swear by what ye see
  69,39,or what ye do not see
  69,40,"verily, it is the speech of a noble apostle"
  69,41,"and it is not the speech of a poet:- little is it ye believe"
  69,42,"And it is not the speech of a soothsayer,- little is it that ye mind"
  69,43,a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
  69,44,Why if he had invented against us any sayings
  69,45,we would have seized him by the right hand
  69,46,then we would have cut his jugular vein
  69,47,nor could any one of you have kept us off from him
  69,48,"Verily, it is a memorial to the pious"
  69,49,"and, verily, we know that there are amongst you those who say it is a lie"
  69,50,"and, verily, it is a source of sighing to the misbelievers"
  69,51,"and, verily, it is certain truth"
  69,52,Therefore celebrate the name of thy mighty Lord
  70,1,An asker asked for torment that must befall
  70,2,for the unbelievers; there is no repelling it
  70,3,from God the Lord of the ascents
  70,4,whereby ascend the angels and the Spirit unto Him in a day whose length is fifty thousand years
  70,5,Wherefore be patient with fair patience
  70,6,"verily, they see it as afar off"
  70,7,but we see it nigh
  70,8,The day when the heaven shall be as molten brass
  70,9,and the mountains shall be like flocks of wool
  70,10,when no warm friend shall question friend
