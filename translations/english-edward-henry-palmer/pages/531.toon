quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,"and our bidding is but one (word), like the twinkling of an eye"
  54,51,We have destroyed the like of you - but is there any who will mind
  54,52,And everything they do is in the books
  54,53,and everything small and great is written down
  54,54,"Verily, the pious shall be amid gardens and rivers"
  54,55,"in the seat of truth, with the powerful king"
  55,1,The Merciful
  55,2,taught the Qur'an
  55,3,He created man
  55,4,taught him plain speech
  55,5,The sun and the moon have their appointed time
  55,6,The herbs and the trees adore
  55,7,"And the heavens, He raised them and set the balance"
  55,8,that ye should not be outrageous in the balance
  55,9,"But weigh ye aright, and stint not the balance"
  55,10,And the earth He has set it for living creatures
  55,11,"therein are fruits and palms, with sheaths"
  55,12,and grain with chaff and frequent shoots
  55,13,Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
  55,14,He created men of crackling clay like the potters
  55,15,And He created the ginn from smokeless fire
  55,16,Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
