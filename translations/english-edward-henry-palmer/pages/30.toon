quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,191,"Kill them wherever ye find them, and drive them out from whence they drive you out; for sedition is worse than slaughter; but fight them not by the Sacred Mosque until they fight you there; then kill them, for such is the recompense of those that misbelieve"
  2,192,"But if they desist, then, verily, God is forgiving and merciful"
  2,193,"But fight them that there be no sedition and that the religion may be God's; but, if they desist, then let there be no hostility save against the unjust"
  2,194,"The sacred month for the sacred month; for all sacred things demand retaliation; and whoso transgresses against you, transgress against him like as he transgressed against you; but fear ye God, and know that God is with those who fear"
  2,195,"Expend in alms in God's way and be not cast by your own hands into perdition; but do good, for God loves those who do good"
  2,196,"And fulfil the pilgrimage and the visitation to God; but if ye be besieged, then what is easiest for you by way of gift. But shave not your heads until your gift shall reach its destination; and he amongst you who is sick or has a hurt upon his head, then the redemption is by fasting or by alms or by an offering. But when ye are safe again, then let him who would enjoy the visitation until the pilgrimage (bring) what is easiest as a gift. And he who cannot find (anything to bring), then let him fast three days on the pilgrimage and seven when ye return; these make ten days complete. That is, for him whose family are not present in the Sacred Mosque; and fear God and know that God is keen to punish"
