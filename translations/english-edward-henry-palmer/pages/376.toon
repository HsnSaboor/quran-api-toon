quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,that will not avail them which they had to enjoy
  26,208,But we do not destroy any city without its having warners
  26,209,"as a reminder, for we are never unjust"
  26,210,The devils did not descend therewith
  26,211,it is not fit work for them; nor are they able to do it
  26,212,"Verily, they are deposed from listening"
  26,213,"call not then with God upon other gods, or thou wilt be of the tormented"
  26,214,but warn thy clansmen who are near of kin
  26,215,And lower thy wing to those of the believers who follow thee
  26,216,"but if they rebel against thee, say, 'Verily, I am clear of what ye do"
  26,217,"and rely thou upon the mighty, merciful One"
  26,218,who sees thee when thou dost stand up
  26,219,and thy posturing amongst those who adore
  26,220,"Verily, He both bears and knows"
  26,221,Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend
  26,222,they descend upon every sinful liar
  26,223,and impart what they have heard; but most of them are liars
  26,224,And the poets do those follow who go astray
  26,225,Dost thou not see that they wander distraught in every vale
  26,226,and that they say that which they do not do
  26,227,"save those who believe, and do right, and remember God much, and defend themselves after they are wronged; but those who do wrong shall know with what a turn they shall be turned"
