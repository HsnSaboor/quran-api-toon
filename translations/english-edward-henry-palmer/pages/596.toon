quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,"None shall broil thereon, but the most wretched"
  92,16,who says it is a lie and turns his back
  92,17,But the pious shall be kept away from it
  92,18,he who gives his wealth in alms
  92,19,and who gives no favour to any one for the sake of reward
  92,20,but only craving the face of his Lord most High
  92,21,in the end he shall be well pleased
  93,1,By the forenoon
  93,2,And the night when it darkens
  93,3,"Thy Lord has not forsaken thee, nor hated thee"
  93,4,and surely the hereafter is better for thee than the former
  93,5,"and in the end thy Lord will give thee, and thou shalt be well pleased"
  93,6,"Did He not find thee an orphan, and give the shelter"
  93,7,"and find thee erring, and guide thee"
  93,8,"and find thee poor with a family, and nourish thee"
  93,9,But as for the orphan oppress him not
  93,10,and as for the beggar drive him not away
  93,11,and as for the favour of thy Lord discourse thereof
  94,1,Have we not expanded for thee thy breast
  94,2,and set down from thee thy load
  94,3,which galled thy back
  94,4,and exalted for thee thy renown
  94,5,"Verily, with difficulty is ease"
  94,6,"verily, with difficulty is ease"
  94,7,And when thou art at leisure then toil
  94,8,and for thy Lord do thou yearn
