quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star when it falls
  53,2,"your comrade errs not, nor is he deluded"
  53,3,nor speaks he out of lust
  53,4,It is but an inspiration inspired
  53,5,One mighty in power taught him
  53,6,"endowed with sound understanding, and appeared"
  53,7,he being in the loftiest tract
  53,8,Then drew he near and hovered o'er
  53,9,until he was two bows length off or nigher still
  53,10,Then he inspired his servant what he inspired him
  53,11,the heart belies not what he saw
  53,12,"What, will ye dispute with him on what he saw"
  53,13,And he saw him another time
  53,14,by the lote tree none may pass
  53,15,near which is the garden of the Abode
  53,16,When there covered the lote tree what did cover it
  53,17,The sight swerved not nor wandered
  53,18,He saw then the greatest of the signs of his Lord
  53,19,Have ye considered Allat and Al 'Huzza
  53,20,and Manat the other third
  53,21,Shall there be male offspring for Him and female for you
  53,22,That were an unfair division
  53,23,"They are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers! God has sent down no authority for them! They do but follow suspicion and what their souls lust after!- And yet there has come to them guidance from their Lord"
  53,24,Shall man have what he desires
  53,25,But God's is the hereafter and the present
  53,26,"How many an angel in the heaven!- their intercession avails not at all, save after God has given permission to whomsoever He will and is pleased with"
