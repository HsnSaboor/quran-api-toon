quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,For the uniting of the Qurais
  106,2,uniting them for the caravan of winter and summer
  106,3,So let them serve the Lord of this house
  106,4,who feeds them against hunger and makes them safe against fear
  107,1,Hast thou considered him who calls the judgment a lie
  107,2,He it is who pushes the orphan away
  107,3,and urges not (others) to feed the poor
  107,4,But woe to those who pray
  107,5,and who are careless in their prayers
  107,6,Who pretend
  107,7,and withhold necessaries
  108,1,"Verily, we have given thee El Kauthar"
  108,2,So pray to thy Lord and slaughter (victims)
  108,3,"Verily, he who hates thee shall be childless"
