quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  76,6,a spring from which God's servants shall drink and make it gush out as they please
  76,7,"They who fulfill their vows, and fear a day, the evil which shall fly abroad"
  76,8,and who give food for His love to the poor and the orphan and the captive
  76,9,We only feed you for God's sake; we desire not from you either reward or thanks
  76,10,"we fear from our Lord a frowning, calamitous day"
  76,11,And God will guard them from the evil of that day and will cast on them brightness and joy
  76,12,and their reward for their patience shall be Paradise and silk
  76,13,reclining therein upon couches they shall neither see therein sun nor piercing cold
  76,14,and close down upon them shall be its shadows; and lowered over them its fruits to cull
  76,15,and they shall be served round with vessels of silver and goblets that are as flagons
  76,16,flagons of silver which they shall mete out
  76,17,and they shall drink therein a cup tempered with Zingabil
  76,18,a spring therein named Silsabil
  76,19,and there shall go round about them eternal boys; when thou seest them thou wilt think them scattered pearls
  76,20,and when thou seest them thou shalt see pleasure and a great estate
  76,21,On them shall be garments of green embroidered satin and brocade; and they shall be adorned with bracelets of silver; and their Lord shall give them to drink pure drink
  76,22,"Verily, this is a reward for you, and your efforts are thanked"
  76,23,"Verily, we have sent down upon thee the Qur'an"
  76,24,"Wherefore wait patiently for the judgment of thy Lord, and obey not any sinner or misbeliever amongst them"
  76,25,"But remember the name of thy Lord morning, and evening"
