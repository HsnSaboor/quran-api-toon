quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,But there shall not profit them the intercession of the intercessors
  74,49,What ailed them that they turned away from the memorial
  74,50,as though they were timid asses
  74,51,fleeing from a lion
  74,52,"Nay, every man of them wished that he might have given him books spread open"
  74,53,"Nay, but they did not fear the hereafter"
  74,54,"Nay, it is a memorial"
  74,55,and let him who will remember it
  74,56,but none will remember it except God please. He is most worthy of fear; and he is most worthy to forgive
  75,1,I need not swear by the resurrection day
  75,2,Nor need I swear by the self-accusing soul
  75,3,Does man think that we shall not collect his bones
  75,4,Able are we to arrange his finger tips
  75,5,"Nay, but man wishes to be wicked henceforward"
  75,6,"he asks, When is the resurrection day"
  75,7,But when the sight shall be dazed
  75,8,and the moon be eclipsed
  75,9,and the sun and the moon be together
  75,10,"and man shall say upon that day, 'Where is a place to flee to"
  75,11,"nay, no refuge"
  75,12,and to thy Lord that day is the sure settlement
  75,13,He will inform man on that day of what He has sent forward or delayed
  75,14,"Nay, man is an evidence against himself"
  75,15,and even if he thrusts forward his excuses
  75,16,Do not move thy tongue thereby to hasten it
  75,17,It is for us to collect it and to read it
  75,18,and when we read it then follow its reading
  75,19,And again it is for us to explain it
