quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,"Verily, for the pious is a blissful place"
  78,32,gardens and vineyards
  78,33,and girls with swelling breasts of the same age as themselves
  78,34,and a brimming cup
  78,35,they shall hear therein no folly and no lie
  78,36,"a reward from thy Lord, a sufficient gift"
  78,37,"The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and what is between them both,- the Merciful,- they cannot obtain audience of Him"
  78,38,"The day when the Spirit and the angels shall stand in ranks, they shall not speak save to whom the Merciful permits, and who speaks aright"
  78,39,That is the true day; and whoso pleases let him take to a resort unto his Lord
  78,40,"Verily, we have warned you of a torment that is nigh: on a day when man shall see what his two hands have sent forward; and the misbeliever shall say, 'Would that I were dust"
  79,1,By those who tear out violently
  79,2,And by those who gaily release
  79,3,And by those who float through the air
  79,4,And the preceders who precede
  79,5,And those who manage the affair
  79,6,On the day when the quaking quakes
  79,7,which the following one shall succeed
  79,8,Hearts on that day shall tremble
  79,9,eyes thereon be humbled
  79,10,"They say, 'Shall we be sent back to our old course"
  79,11,What! when we are rotten bones
  79,12,"they say, 'That then were a losing return"
  79,13,But it will only be one scare
  79,14,and lo! they will be on the surface
  79,15,Has the story of Moses come to you
