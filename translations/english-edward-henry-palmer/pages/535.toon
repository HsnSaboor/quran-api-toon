quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,Around them shall go eternal youths
  56,18,with goblets and ewers and a cup of flowing wine
  56,19,"no headache shall they feel therefrom, nor shall their wits be dimmed"
  56,20,And fruits such as they deem the best
  56,21,And flesh of fowl as they desire
  56,22,And bright and large-eyed maids
  56,23,like hidden pearls
  56,24,A reward for that which they have done
  56,25,They shall hear no folly there and no sin
  56,26,"Only the speech, 'Peace, Peace"
  56,27,And the fellows of the right - what right lucky fellows
  56,28,Amid thornless lote trees
  56,29,And tall trees with piles of fruit
  56,30,And outspread shade
  56,31,And water out-poured
  56,32,And fruit in abundance
  56,33,neither failing nor forbidden
  56,34,And beds upraised
  56,35,"Verily, we have produced them a production"
  56,36,And made them virgins
  56,37,darlings of equal age (with their spouses)
  56,38,for the fellows of the right
  56,39,A crowd of those of yore
  56,40,and a crowd of those of the latter day
  56,41,And the fellows of the left - what unlucky fellows
  56,42,In hot blasts and boiling water
  56,43,And a shade of pitchy smoke
  56,44,Neither cool nor generous
  56,45,"Verily, they were affluent ere this"
  56,46,and did persist in mighty crime
  56,47,"and used to say, 'What, when we die and have become dust and bones, shall we then indeed be raised"
  56,48,or our fathers of yore
  56,49,"Say, 'Verily, those of yore and those of the latter day"
  56,50,shall surely be gathered together unto the tryst of the well-known day
