quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"Said he, 'And about what is your errand, O ye messengers"
  51,32,"They said, 'Verily, we are sent unto a sinful people"
  51,33,to send upon them stones of clay
  51,34,marked from thy Lord for the extravagant
  51,35,And we sent out therefrom such as were in it of the believers
  51,36,but we only found therein one house of Muslims
  51,37,And we left therein a sign to those who fear the grievous woe
  51,38,And in Moses; when we sent him to Pharaoh with obvious authority
  51,39,"But he turned his back towards his column and said, 'A sorcerer or mad"
  51,40,And we seized him and his hosts and hurled them into the sea; for he was to be blamed
  51,41,"And in 'Ad, when we sent against them a desolating wind"
  51,42,that left naught on which it came without making it ashes
  51,43,"And in Thamud, when it was said to them, 'Enjoy yourselves for a season"
  51,44,But they revolted against the bidding of their Lord; and the noise caught them as they looked on
  51,45,"And they could not stand upright, and they were not helped"
  51,46,"And the people of Noah of yore; verily, they were an abominable people"
  51,47,"And the heaven - we have built it with might, and, verily, we do surely give it ample space"
  51,48,And the earth - we have spread it out; and how well we lay it out
  51,49,"And of everything have we created pairs, haply ye may be mindful"
  51,50,"Flee then to God; verily, I am a plain warner from Him to you"
  51,51,"And do not set with God another god; verily, I am a plain warner from Him to you"
