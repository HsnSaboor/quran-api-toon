quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,"they shall gaze on each other, and the sinner would fain give as a ransom from the torment of that day his sons"
  70,12,"and his mate, and his brother"
  70,13,and his kin who stand by him
  70,14,"and all who are in the earth, that yet it might rescue him"
  70,15,"Nay, verily, it is a flame"
  70,16,dragging by the scalp
  70,17,it shall call those who retreated and turned their backs
  70,18,and who amassed and hoarded
  70,19,"Verily, man is by nature rash"
  70,20,"when evil touches him, very impatient"
  70,21,"when good touches him, niggardly"
  70,22,all save those who pray
  70,23,who remain at their prayers
  70,24,and in whose wealth is a reasonable due (set aside)
  70,25,for him who asks and him who is kept from asking
  70,26,and those who believe in a day of judgment
  70,27,and those who shrink in terror from the torment of their Lord
  70,28,"verily, the torment of their Lord is not safe"
  70,29,and those who guard their private parts
  70,30,"except for their wives or the (slave girls) whom their right hands possess, for they are not to be blamed"
  70,31,"but whoso craves beyond this, they are the transgressors"
  70,32,and those who observe their trusts and their compacts
  70,33,and those who are upright in their testimonies
  70,34,and those who keep their prayers
  70,35,these shall dwell in gardens honoured
  70,36,What ails the misbelievers that they hurry on before thee
  70,37,crowding together on the right and on the left
  70,38,Does every man of them wish to enter the garden of pleasure
  70,39,"Nay, we created them of what they know"
