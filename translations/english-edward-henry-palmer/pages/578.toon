  75,20,"Nay, indeed, but ye love the transient life"
  75,21,and ye neglect the hereafter
  75,22,Faces on that day shall be bright
  75,23,gazing on their Lord
  75,24,And faces on that day shall be dismal
  75,25,Thou wilt think that a back-breaking calamity has happened to them
  75,26,"Nay, but when the [soul] comes up into the throat"
  75,27,"and it is said, 'Who will charm it back"
  75,28,"and he will think that it is his parting [hour]"
  75,29,And leg shall be pressed on leg
  75,30,unto thy Lord on that day shall the driving be
  75,31,For he did not believes and did not pray
  75,32,"but he said it was a lie, and turned his back"
  75,33,Then he went to his people haughtily
  75,34,"woe to thee, and woe to thee"
  75,35,"again woe to thee, and woe to thee"
  75,36,Does man think that he shall be left to himself
  75,37,Wasn't he a clot of emitted seed
  75,38,"Then he was congealed blood, and (God) created him, and fashioned him"
  75,39,"and made of him pairs, male and female"
  75,40,Is not He able to quicken the dead
  76,1,Does there not come on man a portion of time when he is nothing worth mentioning
  76,2,"Verily, We created man from a mingled clot, to try him; and we gave him hearing and sight"
  76,3,"Verily, we guided him in the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful"
  76,4,"Verily, we have prepared for those who misbelieve chains and fetters and a blaze"
  76,5,"Verily, the righteous shall drink of a cup tempered with Kafur"
