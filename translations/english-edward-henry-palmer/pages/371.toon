quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,and give me a tongue of good report amongst posterity
  26,85,and make me of the heirs of the paradise of pleasure
  26,86,"and pardon my father, verily, he is of those who err"
  26,87,and disgrace me not on the day when they are raised up again
  26,88,"the day when wealth shall profit not, nor sons"
  26,89,but only he who comes to God with a sound heart
  26,90,And paradise shall be brought near to the pious
  26,91,and hell shall be brought forth to those who go astray
  26,92,"and it shall be said to them, \"Where is what ye used to worship"
  26,93,"beside God? can they help you, or get help themselves"
  26,94,"And they shall fall headlong into it, they and those who have gone astray"
  26,95,and the hosts of Iblis all together
  26,96,"They shall say, while they quarrel therein"
  26,97,By God! we were surely in an obvious error
  26,98,when we made you equal to the Lord of the worlds
  26,99,but it was only sinners who led us astray
  26,100,But we have no intercessors
  26,101,and no warm friend
  26,102,but had we a turn we would be of the believers
  26,103,"Verily, in that is a sign, but most of them will never be believers"
  26,104,"and, verily, thy Lord He is mighty and merciful"
  26,105,The people of Noah said the apostles were liars
  26,106,"when their brother Noah said to them, 'Will ye not fear"
  26,107,"verily, I am a faithful apostle to you"
  26,108,then fear God and obey me
  26,109,I do not ask you for it any hire; my hire is only with the Lord of the worlds
  26,110,So fear God and obey me
  26,111,"They said, 'Shall we believe in thee, when the reprobates follow thee"
