  48,16,"Say to those desert Arabs who were left behind, 'Ye shall be called out against a people endowed with vehement valour, and shall fight them or they shall become Muslims. And if ye obey, God will give you a good hire; but if ye turn your backs, as ye turned your backs before, He will torment you with grievous woe"
  48,17,"There is no compulsion on the blind, and no compulsion on the lame, and no compulsion on the sick, but whoso obeys God and His Apostle, He will make him enter gardens beneath which rivers flow; but whoso turns his back He will torment with grievous woe"
  48,18,"God was well pleased with the believers when they did swear allegiance to thee beneath the tree; and He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down His shechina upon them and rewarded them with a victory nigh at hand"
  48,19,"and many spoils for them to take; for God is mighty, wise"
  48,20,"God promised you many spoils and hastened this on for you, and restrained men's hands from you; and it may be a sign for the believers and guide you in a right way"
  48,21,and other (spoils) which ye could not gain; but God has encompassed them; for God is mighty over all
  48,22,"And had those who misbelieved fought you, they would have turned their backs; then they would have found neither patron nor helper"
  48,23,"God's course which has been followed before, and thou shalt find no change in the course of God"
