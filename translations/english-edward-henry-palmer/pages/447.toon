quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,25,Why do ye not help each other
  37,26,"nay, on that day they shall resign themselves"
  37,27,"and some shall draw near to others, to question each other"
  37,28,"and they shall say, 'Verily, ye came to us from the right"
  37,29,"They shall say, 'Nay, ye were not believers"
  37,30,"nor had we any authority over you; nay, ye were an outrageous people"
  37,31,"And the sentence of our Lord shall be due for us; verily, we shall surely taste thereof"
  37,32,"we did seduce you - verily, we were erring too"
  37,33,"therefore, verily, on that day they shall share the torment"
  37,34,thus it is that we will do with the sinners
  37,35,"Verily, when it is said to them, 'There is no god but God,' they get too big with pride"
  37,36,"and say, 'What! shall we leave our gods for an infatuated poet"
  37,37,"Nay, he came with the truth, and verified the apostles"
  37,38,"verily, ye are going to taste of grievous woe"
  37,39,nor shall ye be rewarded save for that which ye have done
  37,40,Except God's sincere servants
  37,41,these shall have a stated provision
  37,42,"of fruits, and they shall be honoured"
  37,43,in the gardens of pleasure
  37,44,upon couches facing each other
  37,45,they shall be served all round with a cup from a spring
  37,46,white and delicious to those who drink
  37,47,"wherein is no insidious spirit, nor shall they be drunk therewith"
  37,48,"and with them damsels, restraining their looks, large eyed"
  37,49,as though they were a sheltered egg
  37,50,and some shall come forward to ask others
  37,51,"and a speaker amongst them shall say, 'Verily, I had a mate"
