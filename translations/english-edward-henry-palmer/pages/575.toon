quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Verily, thy Lord knows that thou dost stand up to pray nearly two-thirds of the night, or the half of it or the third of it, as do part of those who are with thee; for God measures the night and the day; He knows that ye cannot calculate it, and He turns relentant towards you. So read what is easy of the Qur'an. He knows that there will be of you some who are sick and others who beat about in the earth craving the grace of God, and others who are fighting in the cause of God. Then read what is easy of it and be steadfast in prayer, and give alms, and lend to God a goodly loan, for what ye send forward for yourselves of good ye will find it with God. It is better and a greater hire; and ask ye pardon of God: verily, God is forgiving, merciful"
  74,1,O thou who art covered
  74,2,rise up and warn
  74,3,And thy Lord magnify
  74,4,And thy garments purify
  74,5,And abomination shun
  74,6,And grant not favours to gain increase
  74,7,And for thy Lord await
  74,8,And when the trump is blown
  74,9,for that day is a difficult day
  74,10,for the misbelievers aught but easy
  74,11,Leave me alone with him I have created
  74,12,and for whom I have made extensive wealth
  74,13,and sons that he may look upon
  74,14,and for whom I have smoothed things down
  74,15,Then he desires that I should increase
  74,16,"nay, verily, he is hostile to our signs"
  74,17,I will drive him up a hill
