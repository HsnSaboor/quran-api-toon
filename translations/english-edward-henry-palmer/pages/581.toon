quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Did we not create you from contemptible water
  77,21,and place it in a sure depository
  77,22,unto a certain decreed term
  77,23,for we are able and well able too
  77,24,Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
  77,25,Have we not made for them the earth
  77,26,to hold the living and the dead
  77,27,and set thereon firm mountains reared aloft? and given you to drink water in streams
  77,28,Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
  77,29,Go off to that which ye did call a lie
  77,30,Go off to the shadow of three columns
  77,31,that shall not shade nor avail against the flame
  77,32,"Verily, it throws off sparks like towers"
  77,33,as though they were yellow camels
  77,34,Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
  77,35,This is the day when they may not speak
  77,36,when they are not permitted to excuse themselves
  77,37,Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
  77,38,This is the day of decision! We have assembled you with those of yore
  77,39,if ye have any stratagem employ it now
  77,40,Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
  77,41,"Verily, the pious are amid shades and springs"
  77,42,and fruit such as they love
  77,43,"Eat and drink with good digestion, for that which ye have done"
  77,44,"Verily, thus do we reward those who do well"
  77,45,Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
  77,46,"Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little; verily, ye are sinners"
  77,47,Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
  77,48,"And when it is said to them bow down, they bow not down"
  77,49,Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
  77,50,And in what new discourse after it will they believe
