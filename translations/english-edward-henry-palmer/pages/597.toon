quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the fig! And by the olive
  95,2,And by Mount Sinai
  95,3,And by this safe land
  95,4,We have indeed created man in the best of symmetry
  95,5,Then we will send him back the lowest of the low
  95,6,save those who believe and act aright; for theirs is a hire that is not grudged
  95,7,But what shall make thee call the judgment after this a lie
  95,8,Is not God a most just of judges
  96,1,"READ, in the name of thy Lord"
  96,2,Who created man from congealed blood
  96,3,"Read, for thy Lord is most generous"
  96,4,Who taught the pen
  96,5,Taught man what he did not know
  96,6,"Nay, verily, man is indeed outrageous"
  96,7,at seeing himself get rich
  96,8,"Verily, unto thy Lord is the return"
  96,9,Hast thou considered him who forbids
  96,10,a servant when he prays
  96,11,Hast thou considered if he were in guidance
  96,12,or bade piety
  96,13,"Hast thou considered if he said it was a lie, and turned his back"
  96,14,Did he not know that God can see
  96,15,"Nay, surely, if he do not desist we will drag him by the forelock"
  96,16,the lying sinful forelock
  96,17,So let him call his counsel
  96,18,we will call the guards of hell
  96,19,"Nay, obey him not, but adore and draw nigh"
