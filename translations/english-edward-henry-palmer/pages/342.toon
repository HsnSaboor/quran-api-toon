quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,Prosperous are the believers
  23,2,who in their prayers are humble
  23,3,and who from vain talk turn aside
  23,4,and who in almsgiving are active
  23,5,And who guard their private parts
  23,6,"except for their wives or what their right hands possess for then, verily, they are not to be blamed"
  23,7,"but whoso craves aught beyond that, they are the transgressors"
  23,8,and who observe their trusts and covenants
  23,9,and who guard well their prayers
  23,10,these are the heirs
  23,11,who shall inherit Paradise; they shall dwell therein for aye
  23,12,We have created man from an extract of clay
  23,13,then we made him a clot in a sure depository
  23,14,"then we created the clot congealed blood, and we created the congealed blood a morsel; then we created the morsel bone, and we clothed the bone with flesh then we produced it another creation; and blessed be God, the best of creators"
  23,15,Then shall ye after that surely die
  23,16,then shall ye on the day of resurrection be raised
  23,17,And we have created above you seven roads; nor are we heedless of the creation
