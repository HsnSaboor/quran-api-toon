quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,"Nay, verily, the book of the wicked is in Siggin"
  83,8,and what shall make thee know what Siggin is
  83,9,a book inscribed
  83,10,Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
  83,11,Who call the judgment day a lie
  83,12,but none shall call it a lie except every sinful transgressor
  83,13,"who, when our signs are read to him, says, Old folks tales"
  83,14,"Nay, but that which they have gained has settled upon their hearts"
  83,15,"Nay, verily, from their Lord on that day are they veiled"
  83,16,"and then, verily, they shall broil in hell"
  83,17,"then it shall be said, 'This is what ye once did call a lie"
  83,18,"Nay, verily, the book of the righteous is in Illiyun"
  83,19,and what shall make thee know what Illiyun is
  83,20,book inscribed
  83,21,those nigh to God shall witness it
  83,22,"Verily, the righteous shall be in pleasure"
  83,23,upon couches shall they gaze
  83,24,thou mayest recognise in their faces the brightness of pleasure
  83,25,they shall be given to drink wine that is sealed
  83,26,whose seal is musk; for that then let the aspirants aspire
  83,27,and it shall be tempered with Tasnim
  83,28,a spring from which those nigh to God shall drink
  83,29,"Verily, those who sin do laugh at those who believe"
  83,30,and when they pass by they wink at one another
  83,31,and when they return to their family they return ridiculing them
  83,32,"and when they see them they say, Verily, these do go astray"
  83,33,but they are not sent as guardians over them
  83,34,But today those who believe shall at the misbelievers laugh
