quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and its noonday brightness
  91,2,And the moon when it follows him
  91,3,And the day when it displays him
  91,4,And the night when it covers him
  91,5,And the heaven and what built it
  91,6,And the earth and what spread it
  91,7,"And the soul and what fashioned it, and taught it"
  91,8,its sin and its piety
  91,9,Prosperous is he who purifies it
  91,10,And disappointed is he who corrupts it
  91,11,Thamud called the apostle a liar in their outrage
  91,12,when their wretch rose up
  91,13,"and the apostle of God said to them, God's she-camel! so give her to drink"
  91,14,"But they called him a liar, and they ham-strung her; but their Lord destroyed them in their sins, and served them all alike"
  91,15,and He fears not the result thereof
  92,1,By the night when it veils
  92,2,And the day when it is displayed
  92,3,And by what created male and female
  92,4,"Verily, your efforts are diverse"
  92,5,But as for him who gives alms and fears God
  92,6,And believes in the best

  92,8,"But as for him who is niggardly, And longs for wealth"
  92,9,And calls the good a lie
  92,10,We will send him easily to difficulty
  92,11,And his wealth shall not avail him When he falls down (into hell)
  92,12,"Verily, it is for us to guide"
  92,13,"And, verily, ours are the hereafter and the former life"
  92,14,And I have warned you of a fire that flames
