quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"And when they hear what has been revealed to the prophet, you will see their eyes gush with tears at what they recognise as truth therein; and they will say, 'O our Lord! we believe, so write us down amongst the witnesses"
  5,84,"Why should we not believe in God and the truth that is given to us, nor desire that our Lord should make us enter with the upright people"
  5,85,"Therefore has God rewarded them, for what they said, with gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for aye; that is the reward of those who do good"
  5,86,"but those who disbelieve and say our signs are lies, they are the fellows of hell"
  5,87,"O ye who believe! forbid not the good things which God has made lawful for you, nor transgress; verily, God loves not the transgressors"
  5,88,"But eat of what God has provided you lawfully of good things; and fear God, in whom ye believe"
  5,89,"God will not catch you up for a casual word in your oaths, but He will catch you up for having what ye make deliberate oaths about; and the expiation thereof is to feed ten poor men with the middling food ye feed your families withal, or to clothe them, or to free a neck; but he who has not the means, then let him fast three days. That is the expiation of your oaths, when ye have sworn to keep your oaths; thus does God explain to you His signs, - haply ye may be grateful"
