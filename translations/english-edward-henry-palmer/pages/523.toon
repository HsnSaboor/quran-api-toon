quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  51,52,"Thus there came no apostle to those before them, but they said, 'A sorcerer, mad"
  51,53,"Do they bequeath it to each other? Yea, they are an outrageous people"
  51,54,"So turn thy back upon them, so thou wilt not be to blame"
  51,55,"And remind; for, verily, the reminder shall profit the believers"
  51,56,And I have not created the ginn and mankind save that they may worship me
  51,57,"I do not desire any provision from them, and I do not wish them to feed me"
  51,58,"Verily, God, He is the provider, endowed with steady might"
  51,59,"Verily, for those who injure (the Apostle) shall be a portion like the portion of their fellows, but let them not hurry Me"
  51,60,Then woe to those who misbelieve from their day which they are threatened
  52,1,By the mount
  52,2,by the Book inscribed
  52,3,upon an outstretched vellum
  52,4,by the frequented house
  52,5,by the elevated roof
  52,6,by the swelling sea
  52,7,"verily, the torment of thy Lord will come to pass"
  52,8,there is none to avert it
  52,9,The day when the heavens shall reel about
  52,10,and the mountains shall move about
  52,11,then woe upon that day to those who call (the apostles) liars
  52,12,who plunge into discussion for a sport
  52,13,On the day when they shall be thrust away into the fire of hell
  52,14,"This is the fire, the which ye used to call a lie"
