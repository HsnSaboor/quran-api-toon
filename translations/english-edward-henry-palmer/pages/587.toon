quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When the heaven is cleft asunder
  82,2,And when the stars are scattered
  82,3,And when the seas gush together
  82,4,And when the tombs are turned upside down
  82,5,The soul shall know what it has sent on or kept back
  82,6,O man! what has seduced thee concerning thy generous Lord
  82,7,"who created thee, and fashioned thee, and gave thee symmetry"
  82,8,and in what form He pleased composed thee
  82,9,"Nay, but ye call the judgment a lie"
  82,10,but over you are guardians set
  82,11,"noble, writing down"
  82,12,they know what ye do
  82,13,"Verily, the righteous are in pleasure"
  82,14,"and, verily, the wicked are in hell"
  82,15,they shall broil therein upon the judgment day
  82,16,nor shall they be absent therefrom
  82,17,And what shall make thee know what is the judgment day
  82,18,"Again, what shall make thee know what is the judgment day"
  82,19,a day when no soul shall control aught for another; and the bidding on that day belongs to God
  83,1,Woe to those who give short weight
  83,2,who when they measure against others take full measure
  83,3,"but when they measure to them or weigh to them, diminish"
  83,4,Do not these think that they shall be raised again
  83,5,at the mighty day
  83,6,the day when men shall stand before the Lord of the worlds
