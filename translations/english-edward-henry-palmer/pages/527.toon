  53,28,"but they have no knowledge thereof; they do but follow suspicion, and, verily, suspicion shall not avail against the truth at all"
  53,29,But turn aside from him who turns his back upon our remembrance and desires naught but this world's life
  53,30,"This is their sum of knowledge; verily, thy Lord knows best who has erred from His way, and He knows best who is guided"
  53,31,"God's is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, that He may reward those who do evil for what they have done; and may reward those who do good with good"

  53,39,and that man shall have only that for which he strives
  53,40,and that his striving shall at length be seen
  53,41,Then shall he be rewarded for it with the most full reward
  53,42,and that unto thy Lord is the limit
  53,43,and that it is He who makes men laugh and weep
  53,44,and that it is He who kills and makes alive
