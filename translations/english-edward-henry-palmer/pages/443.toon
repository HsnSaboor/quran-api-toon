  36,41,And a sign for them is that we bear their seed in a laden ship
  36,42,and we have created for them the like thereof whereon to ride
  36,43,"and if we please, we drown them, and there is none for them to appeal to; nor are they rescued"
  36,44,"save by mercy from us, as a provision for a season"
  36,45,"And when it is said to them, 'Fear what is before you and what is behind you, haply ye may obtain mercy"
  36,46,"and thou bringest them not any one of the signs of their Lord, but they turn away therefrom"
  36,47,"and when it is said to them, 'Expend in alms of what God has bestowed upon you,' those who misbelieve say to those who believe, 'Shall we feed him whom, if God pleased, He would feed? ye are only in an obvious error"
  36,48,"They say, 'When shall this promise come to pass, if ye do tell the truth"
  36,49,"They await but a single noise, that shall seize them as they are contending"
  36,50,And they shall not be able to make a bequest; nor to their people shall they return
  36,51,"but the trumpet shall be blown, and, behold, from their graves unto their Lord shall they slip out"
  36,52,"They shall say, 'O, woe is us! who has raised us up from our sleeping-place? this is what the Merciful promised, and the apostles told the truth"
  36,53,"It shall be but a single noise, and lo! they are all arraigned before us"
  36,54,"And on that day no soul shall be wronged at all, nor shall ye be rewarded for aught but that which ye have done"
