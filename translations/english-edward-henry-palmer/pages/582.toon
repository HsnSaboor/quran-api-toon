quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,Of what do they ask each other
  78,2,Of the mighty information
  78,3,whereon they do dispute
  78,4,"nay, they shall know too well"
  78,5,"Again, nay, they shall know too well"
  78,6,Have we not set the earth as a couch
  78,7,and the mountains as stakes
  78,8,and created you in pairs
  78,9,and made your sleep for rest
  78,10,and made the night a garment
  78,11,and made the day for livelihood
  78,12,and built above you seven solid (heavens)
  78,13,and set a burning lamp
  78,14,"and, sent down from the rain-expressing clouds water pouring forth"
  78,15,to bring out thereby the grain and herb
  78,16,and gardens thickly planted
  78,17,"Verily, the day of decision is an appointed time"
  78,18,"and the day when the trumpet shall be blown, and ye shall come in troops"
  78,19,"and the heavens shall be opened, and shall be all doors"
  78,20,"and the mountains shall be moved, and shall be like a mirage"
  78,21,"Verily, hell is an ambuscade"
  78,22,a reward for the outrageous
  78,23,to tarry therein for ages
  78,24,They shall not taste therein cool nor drink
  78,25,but only boiling water and pus
  78,26,a fit reward
  78,27,"Verily, they did not hope for the account"
  78,28,but they ever said our signs were lies
  78,29,Everything have we remembered in a book
  78,30,"Then taste, for we will only increase your torment"
