  26,116,"They said, 'Verily, if thou desist not, O Noah! thou shalt surely be of those who are stoned"
  26,117,"Said he, 'My Lord! verily, my people call me liar"
  26,118,"open between me and between them an opening, and save me and those of the believers who are with me"

  26,132,and fear Him who hath

  26,134,and gardens and springs
  26,135,"Verily, fear for you the torment of a mighty day"
  26,136,"They said, 'It is the same to us if thou admonish or art not of those who do admonish"
