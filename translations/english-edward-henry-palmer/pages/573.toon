quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,"And, verily, of us are some who are Muslims, and of us some are trespassers; but those of us who are Muslims they strive after right direction"
  72,15,and as for the trespassers they are fuel for hell
  72,16,"And if they will go right upon the way, we will irrigate them with copious water"
  72,17,to try them thereby; and whoso turns from the remembrance of his Lord He will drive him to severe torment
  72,18,"And (say) that the mosques are God's, and that ye should not call on any one with God"
  72,19,and that when God's servant stood up to pray they called out to him and well-nigh crowded upon him
  72,20,"Say, 'I only call upon my Lord, and I join no one with Him"
  72,21,"Say, 'Verily, I cannot control for you either harm, or right direction"
  72,22,"Say, 'Verily, as for me none can protect me against God, nor do I find any refuge beside Him"
  72,23,"except delivering the message from God and His errands: and whoso rebels against God and His Apostle, verily, for him is the fire of hell for them to dwell therein for ever and for aye"
  72,24,"Until when they see what they are threatened with, then shall they surely know who is most weak at helping and fewest in numbers"
  72,25,"Say, 'I know not if what ye are threatened with be nigh, or if my Lord will set for it a term"
  72,26,"He knows the unseen, and He lets no one know His unseen"
  72,27,"save such apostle as He is well pleased with: for, verily, He sends marching before him and behind him a guard"
  72,28,"That He may know that they have delivered the errands of their Lord, for He compasses what they have, and reckons everything by number"
