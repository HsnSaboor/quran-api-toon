quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,Nay! but ye prefer the life of this world
  87,17,while the hereafter is better and more lasting
  87,18,"Verily, this was in the books of yore"
  87,19,the books of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Has there come to thee the story of the overwhelming
  88,2,Faces on that day shall be humble
  88,3,"labouring, toiling"
  88,4,shall broil upon a burning fire
  88,5,shall be given to drink from a boiling spring
  88,6,no food shall they have save from the foul thorn
  88,7,which shall not fatten nor avail against hunger
  88,8,Faces on that day shall be comfortable
  88,9,content with their past endeavours
  88,10,in a lofty garden
  88,11,wherein they shall hear no foolish word
  88,12,wherein is a flowing fountain
  88,13,wherein are couches raised on high
  88,14,and goblets set down
  88,15,and cushions arranged
  88,16,and carpets spread
  88,17,Do they not look then at the camel how she is created
  88,18,And at the heaven how it is reared
  88,19,And at the mountains how they are set up
  88,20,And at the earth how it is spread out
  88,21,"But remind: thou art only one to remind"
  88,22,thou art not in authority over them
  88,23,except such as turns his back and misbelieves
  88,24,for him will God torment with the greatest torment
  88,25,"Verily, unto us is their return"
  88,26,"and, verily, for us is their account"
