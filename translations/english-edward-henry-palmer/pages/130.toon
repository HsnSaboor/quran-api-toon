quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Say, 'What is the greatest witness?' Say, 'God is witness between you and me.' This Qur'an was inspired to me to warn you and those it reaches. Do ye really bear witness that with God are other gods? Say, 'I bear not witness thereto:' say, 'He is but one God, and I am clear of your associating (gods with him)"
  6,20,Those to whom we have brought the Book know him as they know their sons;- those who lose their souls do not believe
  6,21,"Who is more unjust than he who forges against God a lie, or says His signs are lies? verily, the unjust shall not prosper"
  6,22,"On the day when we shall gather them all together, then shall we say to those who have associated others with ourself, 'Where are your associates whom ye did pretend"
  6,23,"Then they will have no excuse but to say, 'By God our Lord, we did not associate (others with thee)"
  6,24,"See how they lie against themselves, and how what they did forge deserts them"
  6,25,"And they are some who listen unto thee, but we have placed a veil upon their hearts lest they should understand it, and in their ears is dullness of hearing; and though they saw each sign they would not believe therein; until when they come to thee to wrangle with thee, the unbelievers say, 'These are but old folks' tales"
  6,26,They forbid it and they avoid it;- but they destroy none but themselves; yet they do not perceive
  6,27,"But couldst thou see when they are set over the fire and say, 'Would that we were sent back! we would not call our Lord's signs lies, but we would be of the believers"
