quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,Upon couches shall they gaze
  83,36,are the misbelievers rewarded for what they have done
  84,1,When the heaven is rent asunder
  84,2,"and gives ear unto its Lord, and is dutiful"
  84,3,And when the earth is stretched out
  84,4,"and casts forth what is in it, and is empty"
  84,5,"and gives ear unto its Lord, and is dutiful"
  84,6,"O man! verily, thou are toiling after thy Lord, toiling; wherefore shalt thou meet Him"
  84,7,And as for him who is given his book in his right hand
  84,8,he shall be reckoned with by an easy reckoning
  84,9,and he shall go back to his family joyfully
  84,10,But as for him who is given his book behind his back
  84,11,he shall call out for destruction
  84,12,but he shall broil in a blaze
  84,13,"Verily, he was amongst his family joyful"
  84,14,"Verily, he thought that he should never return to God"
  84,15,"Yea, verily, his Lord on him did look"
  84,16,I need not swear by the evening glow
  84,17,"Or by the night, and what it drives together"
  84,18,Or by the moon when it is at its full
  84,19,Ye shall be surely transferred from state to state
  84,20,What ails them that they do not believe
  84,21,"and, when the Koran is read to them, do not adore"
  84,22,"Nay, those who misbelieve do say it is a lie"
  84,23,but God knows best the (malice) that they hide
  84,24,So give them the glad tidings of grievous woe
  84,25,"save those who believe and act aright, for them is hire that is not grudged"
