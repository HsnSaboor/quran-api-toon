quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By the afternoon
  103,2,"verily, man is in loss"
  103,3,"save those who believe and do right, and bid each other be true, and bid each other be patient"
  104,1,Woe to every slanderous backbiter
  104,2,who collects wealth and counts it
  104,3,He thinks that his wealth can immortalize him
  104,4,Not so! he shall be hurled into ElHutamah
  104,5,And what shall make thee understand what ElHutamah is
  104,6,the fire of God kindled
  104,7,which rises above the hearts
  104,8,"Verily, it is an archway over them"
  104,9,on long-drawn columns
  105,1,Hast thou not seen what thy Lord did with the fellows of the elephant
  105,2,Did He not make their stratagem lead them astray
  105,3,and send down on them birds in flocks
  105,4,to throw down on them stones of baked clay
  105,5,and make them like blades of herbage eaten down
