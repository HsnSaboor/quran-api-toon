quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,what ails you? how ye judge
  37,155,will ye not be mindful
  37,156,or have ye obvious authority
  37,157,then bring your Book if ye do speak the truth
  37,158,"And they made him to be related to the ginns, while the ginns know that they shall be arraigned"
  37,159,celebrated be God's praises from what they attribute
  37,160,save God's sincere servants
  37,161,"Verily, ye and what ye worship"
  37,162,shall not try any one concerning him
  37,163,save him who shall broil in hell
  37,164,"there is none amongst us but has his appointed place, and"
  37,165,"verily, we are ranged, and"
  37,166,"verily, we celebrate His praises"
  37,167,And yet they say
  37,168,Had we a reminder from those of yore
  37,169,we should surely have been of God's sincere servants
  37,170,But they misbelieved in it; but soon shall they know
  37,171,But our word has been passed to our servants who were sent
  37,172,that they should be helped
  37,173,"that, verily, our hosts should gain mastery for them"
  37,174,Then turn thou thy back upon them for a time
  37,175,"and look upon them, for soon they too shall look"
  37,176,Would they hasten on our torment
  37,177,"but when it descends in their court, ill will the morning be of those who have been warned"
  37,178,But turn thy back upon them for a time
  37,179,"and look, for soon they too shall look"
  37,180,"Celebrated be the praises of thy Lord, the Lord of glory, above what they attribute"
  37,181,and peace be upon the apostles
  37,182,"and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds"
