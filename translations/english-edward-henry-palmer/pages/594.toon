  89,24,"He will say, 'Would that I had sent something forward for my life"
  89,25,But on that day no one shall be tormented with a torment like his
  89,26,and none shall be bound with bonds like his
  89,27,O thou comforted soul
  89,28,"return unto thy Lord, well pleased and well pleased with"
  89,29,And enter amongst my servants

  90,18,these are the fellows of the right
  90,19,"But those who disbelieve in our signs, they are the fellows of the left"
  90,20,for them is fire that closes in
