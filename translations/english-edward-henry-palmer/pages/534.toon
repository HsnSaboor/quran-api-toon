quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  55,68,In each fruit and palms and pomegranates
  55,69,Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
  55,70,In them maidens best and fairest
  55,71,Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
  55,72,Bright and large-eyed maids kept in their tents
  55,73,Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
  55,74,Whom no man nor ginn has deflowered before them
  55,75,Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
  55,76,Reclining on green cushions and beautiful carpets
  55,77,Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
  55,78,Blessed be the name of thy Lord possessed of majesty and honour
  56,1,When the inevitable happens
  56,2,none shall call its happening a lie
  56,3,abasing - exalting
  56,4,"When the earth shall quake, quaking"
  56,5,"and the mountains shall crumble, crumbling"
  56,6,and become like motes dispersed
  56,7,And ye shall be three sorts
  56,8,And the fellows of the right hand - what right lucky fellows
  56,9,And the fellows of the left hand - what unlucky fellows
  56,10,And the foremost foremost
  56,11,These are they who are brought nigh
  56,12,In gardens of pleasure
  56,13,A crowd of those of yore
  56,14,And a few of those of the latter day
  56,15,And gold-weft couches
  56,16,reclining on them face to face
