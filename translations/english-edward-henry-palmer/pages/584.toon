quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,when his Lord addressed him in the holy valley of Tuva
  79,17,"Go unto Pharaoh, verily, he is outrageous"
  79,18,"and say, \"Hast thou a wish to purify thyself"
  79,19,"and that I may guide thee to thy Lord, and thou mayest fear"
  79,20,So he showed him the greatest signs
  79,21,but he called him a liar and rebelled
  79,22,Then he retreated hastily
  79,23,"and gathered, and proclaimed"
  79,24,"and said, 'I am your Lord most High"
  79,25,but God seized him with the punishment of the future life and of the former
  79,26,"Verily, in that is a lesson to him who fears"
  79,27,Are ye harder to create or the heaven that He has built
  79,28,He raised its height and fashioned it
  79,29,"and made its night to cover it, and brought forth its noonday light"
  79,30,and the earth after that He did stretch out
  79,31,He brings forth from it its water and its pasture
  79,32,And the mountains He did firmly set
  79,33,a provision for you and for your cattle
  79,34,And when the great predominant calamity shall come
  79,35,on the day when man shall remember what he strove after
  79,36,and hell shall be brought out for him who sees
  79,37,And as for him who was outrageous
  79,38,and preferred the life of this world
  79,39,"verily, hell is the resort"
  79,40,"But as for him who feared the station of his Lord, and prohibited his soul from lust"
  79,41,"verily, Paradise is the resort"
  79,42,"They shall ask thee about the Hour, for when it is set"
  79,43,Whereby canst thou mention it
  79,44,Unto thy Lord its period belongs
  79,45,Thou art only a warner to him who fears it
  79,46,"On the day they see it, it will be as though they had only tarried an evening or the noon thereof"
