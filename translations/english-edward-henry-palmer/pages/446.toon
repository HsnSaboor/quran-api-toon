quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,1,By the (angels) ranged in ranks
  37,2,and the drivers driving
  37,3,and the reciters of the reminder
  37,4,"Verily, your God is one"
  37,5,"the Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between the two, and the Lord of the sunrises"
  37,6,"Verily, we have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the stars"
  37,7,and to preserve it from every rebellious devil
  37,8,that they may not listen to the exalted chiefs; for they are hurled at from every side
  37,9,"driven off, and for them is lasting woe"
  37,10,"save such as snatches off a word, and there follows him a darting flame"
  37,11,Ask them whether they are stronger by nature or (the angels) whom we have created? We have created them of sticky clay
  37,12,"Nay, thou dost wonder and they jest"
  37,13,and when they are reminded they will not remember
  37,14,and when they see a sign they make a jest thereof
  37,15,"and say, 'This is naught but obvious sorcery"
  37,16,"What! when we are dead, and have become earth and bones, shall we then be raised"
  37,17,what! and our fathers of yore
  37,18,"Say, 'Yes, and ye shall shrink up"
  37,19,"and it shall only be one scare, and, behold, they shall look on"
  37,20,"and they shall say, 'O, woe is us! this is the day of judgment"
  37,21,"this is the day of decision, which ye did call a lie"
  37,22,"Gather ye together, ye who were unjust, with their mates and what they used to serve"
  37,23,"beside God, and guide them to the way of hell"
  37,24,"and stop them; verily, they shall be questioned"
