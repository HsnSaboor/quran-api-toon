quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun is folded up
  81,2,And when the stars do fall
  81,3,And when the mountains are moved
  81,4,And when the she-camels ten months gone with young shall be neglected
  81,5,And when the beasts shall be crowded together
  81,6,And when the seas shall surge up
  81,7,And when souls shall be paired with bodies
  81,8,And when the child who was buried alive shall be asked
  81,9,for what sin she was slain
  81,10,And when the pages shall be spread out
  81,11,And when the heaven shall be flayed
  81,12,And when hell shall be set ablaze
  81,13,And when Paradise shall be brought nigh
  81,14,The soul shall know what it has produced
  81,15,I need not swear by the stars that slink back
  81,16,"moving swiftly, slinking into their dens"
  81,17,Nor by the night when darkness draws on
  81,18,Nor by the morn when it first breathes up
  81,19,"Verily, it is the speech of a noble apostle"
  81,20,"mighty, standing sure with the Lord of the throne"
  81,21,obeyed and trusty too
  81,22,Your comrade is not mad
  81,23,he saw him on the plain horizon
  81,24,nor does he grudge to communicate the unseen
  81,25,Nor is it the speech of a pelted devil
  81,26,Then whither do ye go
  81,27,It is but a reminder to the worlds
  81,28,to whomsoever of you pleases to go straight
  81,29,"but ye will not please, except God, the Lord of the world, should please"
