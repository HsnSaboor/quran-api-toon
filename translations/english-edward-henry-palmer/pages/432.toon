quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,32,"Those who were big with pride shall say to those who were thought weak, 'Was it we who turned you away from the guidance after it came to you? nay, ye were sinners"
  34,33,"And those who were thought weak shall say to those who were big with pride, 'Nay, but it was the plotting by night and day, when ye did bid us to disbelieve in God, and to make peers for Him!' and they shall display repentance when they see the torment; and we will put fetters on the necks of those who misbelieved. Shall they be rewarded except for that which they have done"
  34,34,"We have not sent to any city a warner but the opulent thereof said, 'We, in what ye are sent with, disbelieve"
  34,35,"And they say, 'We have more wealth and children, and we shall not be tormented"
  34,36,"Say, 'Verily, my Lord extends provision to whom He pleases or doles it out, but most men do not know"
  34,37,"but neither your wealth nor your children is that which will bring you to a near approach to us, save him who believes and does right; these, for them is a double reward for what they have done, and they in upper rooms shall be secure"
  34,38,"And those who strive concerning our signs to frustrate them, these in the torment shall be arraigned"
  34,39,"Verily, my Lord extends provision to whomsoever He will of His servants, or doles it out to him. And what ye expend in alms at all, He will repay it; for He is the best of providers"
