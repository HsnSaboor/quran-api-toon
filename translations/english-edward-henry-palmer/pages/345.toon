  23,43,"No nation can anticipate its appointed time, nor keep it back"
  23,44,Then we sent our apostles one after another. Whenever its apostle came to any nation they called him a liar; and we made some to follow others; and we made them legends; away then with a people who do not believe
  23,45,Then we sent Moses and his brother Aaron with our signs
  23,46,"and with plain authority to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they were too big with pride, and were a haughty people"
  23,47,"And they said, 'Shall we believe two mortals like ourselves, when their people are servants of ours"
  23,48,"So they called them liars, and were of those who perished"
  23,49,"And we gave Moses the Book, that haply they might be guided"
  23,50,"And we made the son of Mary and his mother a sign; and we lodged them both on a high place, furnished with security and a spring"
  23,51,"O ye apostles! eat of the good things and do right; verily, what ye do I know"
  23,52,"And, verily, this nation of yours is one nation, and I am your Lord; so fear me"

  23,55,Do they reckon that that of which we grant them such an extent
  23,56,"of wealth and children, we hasten to them as good things - nay, but they do not perceive"
  23,57,"Verily, those who shrink with terror at their Lord"
  23,58,and those who in the signs of their Lord believe
  23,59,and those who with their Lord join none
