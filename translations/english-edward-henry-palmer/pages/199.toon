quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,73,"O thou prophet! strive strenuously against the misbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern against them; for their resort is hell, and an ill journey shall it be"
  9,74,"They swear by God they did not speak it, but they did speak the word of misbelief; and they disbelieved after they had embraced Islam, and they designed what they could not attain; and they only disapproved it because God and His Apostle had enriched them of His grace. If they turn again 'tis better for them; but if they turn their backs, God will torment them with mighty woe in this world and in the next, nor shall they have upon the earth a patron or protector"
  9,75,"And of them are some who make a treaty with God, that 'If He bring us of His grace, we will give alms and we will surely be among the righteous"
  9,76,"But when He gave them of His grace they were niggardly thereof, and turned their backs and swerved aside"
  9,77,"So He caused hypocrisy to pursue them in their hearts unto the day when they shall meet Him,- for that they did fail God in what they promised Him, and for that they were liars"
  9,78,"Do they not know that God knows their secrets and their whisperings, and that God knows the unseen things"
  9,79,"Those who defame such of the believers as willingly give their alms, and such as can find nothing to give but their exertions, and who mock at them,- God will mock at them, and for them is grievous woe"
