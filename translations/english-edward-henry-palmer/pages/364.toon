quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,44,"or dost thou reckon that most of them will hear or understand? they are only like the cattle, nay, they err more from the way"
  25,45,Hast thou not looked to thy Lord how He prolongs the shadow? but had He willed He would have made it stationary; then we make the sun a guide thereto
  25,46,then we contract it towards us with an easy contraction
  25,47,"And He it is who made the night for a garment; and sleep for repose, and made the day for men to rise up again"
  25,48,And He it is who sent the winds with glad tidings before His mercy; and we send down from the heavens pure water
  25,49,"to quicken therewith the dead country, and to give it for drink to what we have created,- the cattle and many folk"
  25,50,We have turned it in various ways amongst them that they may remember; though most men refuse aught but to misbelieve
  25,51,"But, had we pleased, we would have sent in every city a warner"
  25,52,So obey not the unbelievers and fight strenuously with them in many a strenuous fight
  25,53,"He it is who has let loose the two seas, this one sweet and fresh, that one bitter and pungent, and has made between them a rigorous prohibition"
  25,54,"And he it is who has created man from water, and has made for him blood relationship and marriage relationship; for thy Lord is mighty"
  25,55,Yet they worship beside God what can neither profit them nor harm them; but he who misbelieves in his Lord backs up (the devil)
