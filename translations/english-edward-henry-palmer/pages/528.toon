quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,"and that He created pairs, male and female"
  53,46,from a clot when it is emitted
  53,47,and that for Him is the next production
  53,48,and that he enriches and gives possession
  53,49,and that He is the Lord of the Dog-star
  53,50,and that He it was who destroyed 'Ad of yore
  53,51,"and Thamud, and left none of them"
  53,52,"and the people of Noah before them,- verily, they were most unjust and outrageous"
  53,53,And the overthrown (cities) He threw down
  53,54,and there covered them what did cover them
  53,55,Which then of your Lord's benefits do ye dispute
  53,56,"This is a warner, one of the warners of yore"
  53,57,The approaching day approaches
  53,58,"there, is none to discover it but God"
  53,59,At this new discourse then do ye wonder
  53,60,and do ye laugh and not weep
  53,61,and ye divert yourselves the while
  53,62,But adore God and serve (Him)
  54,1,"The Hour draws nigh, and the moon is split asunder"
  54,2,"But if they see a sign they turn aside and say, 'Magic, continuous"
  54,3,And they call it a lie and follow their lusts; but every matter is settled
  54,4,There has come to them some information with restraint in it
  54,5,wisdom far-reaching - but warners avail not
  54,6,But turn thy back on them! The day when the caller shall call to an awkward thing
