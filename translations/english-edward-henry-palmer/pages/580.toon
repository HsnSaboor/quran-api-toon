quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  76,26,"and through the night, and adore Him, and celebrate His praises the whole night long"
  76,27,"Verily, these love the transitory life, and leave behind them a heavy day"
  76,28,We created them and strengthened their joints; and if we please we can exchange for the likes of them in their stead
  76,29,"Verily, this is a memorial, and whoso will, let him take unto his Lord a way"
  76,30,"But ye will not please except God please! Verily, God is knowing, wise"
  76,31,He makes whomsoever He pleases to enter into His mercy; but the unjust He has prepared for them a grievous woe
  77,1,By those sent in a series
  77,2,And by those who speed swiftly
  77,3,And by the dispensers abroad
  77,4,And by the separators apart
  77,5,And by those who instil the reminder
  77,6,as an excuse or warning
  77,7,"Verily, what ye are threatened with shall surely happen"
  77,8,And when the stars shall be erased
  77,9,And when the heaven shall be cleft
  77,10,And when the mountains shall be winnowed
  77,11,And when the apostles shall have a time appointed for them
  77,12,For what day is the appointment made
  77,13,For the day of decision
  77,14,and what shall make thee know what the decision is
  77,15,Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
  77,16,Have we not destroyed those of yore
  77,17,and then followed them up with those of the latter day
  77,18,Thus do we with the sinners
  77,19,Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
