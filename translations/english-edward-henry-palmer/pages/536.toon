quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  56,51,"Then ye, O ye who err! who say it is a lie"
  56,52,shall eat of the Zaqqum tree
  56,53,and fill your bellies with it
  56,54,and drink thereon of boiling water
  56,55,and drink as drinks the thirsty camel
  56,56,This is their entertainment on the judgment day
  56,57,"We created you, then why do ye not credit"
  56,58,Have ye considered what ye emit
  56,59,"Do we create it, or are we the creators"
  56,60,We have decreed amongst you death; but we are not forestalled
  56,61,"from making the likes of you in exchange, or producing you as ye know not of"
  56,62,Ye do know the first production - why then do ye not mind
  56,63,Have ye considered what ye till
  56,64,"Do ye make it bear seed, or do we make it bear seed"
  56,65,"If we pleased we could make it mere grit, so that ye would pause to marvel"
  56,66,"Verily, we have got into debt"
  56,67,and we are excluded
  56,68,Have ye considered the water which ye drink
  56,69,"Do ye make it come down from the clouds, or do we make it come down"
  56,70,If we pleased we could make it pungent - why then do ye not give thanks
  56,71,Have ye considered the fire which ye strike
  56,72,"Do ye produce the tree that gives it, or do we produce it"
  56,73,We have made it a memorial and a chattel for the traveller of the waste
  56,74,Then celebrate the grand name of thy Lord
  56,75,So I will not swear by the positions of the stars
  56,76,"and, verily, it is a grand oath if ye did but know"
