quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  72,1,"Say, 'I have been inspired that there listened a company of the ginn, and they said, \"We have heard a marvellous Qur'an"
  72,2,"that guides to the right direction; and we believe therein, and we join no one with our Lord"
  72,3,"for, verily, He - may the majesty of our Lord be exalted!- has taken to Himself neither consort nor son"
  72,4,"And, verily, a fool among us spake against God wide of the mark"
  72,5,And we thought that men and ginn would never speak a lie against God
  72,6,And there are persons amongst men who seek for refuge with persons amongst the ginn; but they increase them in their perverseness
  72,7,"And they thought, as ye thought, that God would not raise up any one from the dead"
  72,8,But we touched the heavens and found them filled with a mighty guard and shooting-stars
  72,9,and we did sit in certain seats thereof to listen; but whoso of us listens now finds a shooting-star for him on guard
  72,10,"And, verily, we know not whether evil be meant for those who are in the earth, or if their Lord means right by them"
  72,11,"And of us are some who are pious, and of us are some who are otherwise: we are in separate bands"
  72,12,"And we thought that we could not frustrate God in the earth, and could not frustrate Him by flight"
  72,13,"But, verily, when we heard the guidance we believed therein, and he who believes in his Lord shall fear neither diminution nor loss"
