quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,and what is in the breasts is brought to light
  100,11,"Verily, thy Lord upon that day indeed is well aware"
  101,1,The smiting
  101,2,What is the smiting
  101,3,And what shall make thee know what the smiting is
  101,4,The day when men shall be like scattered moths
  101,5,and the mountains shall be like flocks of carded wool
  101,6,And as for him whose balance is heavy
  101,7,he shall be in a well-pleasing life
  101,8,But as for him whose balance is light
  101,9,his dwelling shall be the pit of hell
  101,10,And who shall make thee know what it is
  101,11,a burning fire
  102,1,The contention about numbers deludes you
  102,2,till ye visit the tombs
  102,3,Not so! In the end ye shall know
  102,4,And again not so! In the end ye shall know
  102,5,Not so! Did ye but know with certain knowledge
  102,6,Ye shall surely see hell
  102,7,And again ye shall surely see it with an eye of certainty
  102,8,Then ye shall surely be asked about pleasure
