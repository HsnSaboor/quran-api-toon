quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and turned his back
  80,2,for that there came to him a blind man
  80,3,But what should make thee know whether haply he may be purified
  80,4,or may be mindful and the reminder profit him
  80,5,But as for him who is wealthy
  80,6,thou dost attend to him
  80,7,and thou dost not care that he is not purified
  80,8,but as for him who comes to thee earnestly
  80,9,fearing the while
  80,10,from him thou art diverted
  80,11,"Nay! verily, it is a memorial"
  80,12,and whoso pleases will remember it
  80,13,In honoured pages
  80,14,"exalted, purified"
  80,15,in the hands of
  80,16,"noble, righteous scribes"
  80,17,May man be killed! how ungrateful he is
  80,18,Of what did He create him
  80,19,Of a clot. He created him and fated him
  80,20,then the path He did make easy for him
  80,21,"then He killed him, and laid him in the tomb"
  80,22,then when He pleases will He raise him up again
  80,23,"Nay, he has not fulfilled his bidding"
  80,24,But let man look unto his foods
  80,25,"Verily, we have poured the water out in torrents"
  80,26,then we have cleft the earth asunder
  80,27,and made to grow therefrom the grain
  80,28,"and the grape, and the hay"
  80,29,"and the olive, and the palm"
  80,30,and gardens closely planted
  80,31,"and fruits, and grass"
  80,32,a provision for you and for your cattle
  80,33,But when the stunning noise shall come
  80,34,on the day when man shall flee from his brother
  80,35,and his mother and his father
  80,36,and his spouse and his sons
  80,37,Every man among them on that day shall have a business to employ him
  80,38,Faces on that day shall be bright
  80,39,"laughing, joyous"
  80,40,and faces shall have dust upon them
  80,41,darkness shall cover them
  80,42,those are the wicked misbelievers
