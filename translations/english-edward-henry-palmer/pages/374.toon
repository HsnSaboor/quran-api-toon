quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,The people of Lot called the apostles liars
  26,161,"when their brother Lot said to them, 'Do ye not fear"
  26,162,"verily, I am to you a faithful apostle"
  26,163,then fear God and obey me
  26,164,I do not ask you for it any hire; my hire is only with the Lord of the worlds
  26,165,Do ye approach males of all the world
  26,166,"and leave what God your Lord has created for you of your wives? nay, but ye are people who transgress"
  26,167,"They said, 'Surely, if thou dost not desist, O Lot! thou shalt be of those who are expelled"
  26,168,"Said he, 'Verily, I am of those who hate your deed"
  26,169,my Lord! save me and my people from what they do
  26,170,And we saved him and his people all together
  26,171,except an old woman amongst those who lingered
  26,172,Then we destroyed the others
  26,173,and we rained down upon them a rain; and evil was the rain of those who were warned
  26,174,"Verily, in that is a sign; but most, of them will never be believers"
  26,175,"And, verily, thy Lord He is mighty, merciful, compassionate"
  26,176,The fellows of the Grove called the apostles liars
  26,177,"Sho'haib said to them, 'Will ye not fear"
  26,178,"verily, I am to you a faithful apostle"
  26,179,then fear God and obey me
  26,180,I do not ask you for it any hire; my hire is only with the Lord of the worlds
  26,181,"Give good measure, and be not of those who diminish"
  26,182,and weigh with a fair balance
  26,183,"and do not cheat men of their goods; and waste not the land, despoiling it"
