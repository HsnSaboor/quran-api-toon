quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,"that, verily, this is the honourable Qur'an"
  56,78,in the laid-up Book
  56,79,Let none touch it but the purified
  56,80,A revelation from the Lord of the worlds
  56,81,What! this new discourse will ye despise
  56,82,"And make for your provision, that you call it a lie"
  56,83,Why then - when it comes up to the throat
  56,84,and ye at that time look on

  56,96,So celebrate the grand name of thy Lord
  57,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and the earth celebrates the praises of God, for He is the mighty, the wise"
  57,2,"His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth: He quickens and He kills, and He is mighty over all"
  57,3,He is the first and the last; and the outer and the inner; and He all things doth know
