quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the dawn
  89,2,and ten nights
  89,3,And the single and the double
  89,4,And the night when it travels on
  89,5,Is there in that an oath for a man of sense
  89,6,Hast thou not seen how thy Lord did with Ad
  89,7,with Iram of the columns
  89,8,the like of which has not been created in the land
  89,9,And Thamud when they hewed the stones in the valley
  89,10,And Pharaoh of the stakes
  89,11,Who were outrageous in the land
  89,12,and did multiply wickedness therein
  89,13,and thy Lord poured out upon them the scourge of torment
  89,14,"Verily, thy Lord is on a watch tower"
  89,15,"and as for man, whenever his Lord tries him and honours him and grants him favour, then he says, My Lord has honoured me"
  89,16,"but whenever he tries him and doles out to him his subsistence, then he says, My Lord despises me"
  89,17,"Nay, but ye do not honour the orphan"
  89,18,nor do ye urge each other to feed the poor
  89,19,and ye devour the inheritance (of the weak) with a general devouring
  89,20,and ye love wealth with a complete love
  89,21,"Nay, when the earth is crushed to pieces"
  89,22,"and thy Lord comes with the angels, rank on rank"
  89,23,"and hell is brought on that day,- on that day shall man be reminded! but how shall he have a reminder"
