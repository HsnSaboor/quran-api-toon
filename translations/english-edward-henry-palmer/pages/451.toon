quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"But they called him liar; verily, they shall surely be arraigned"
  37,128,save God's sincere servants
  37,129,"And we, left for him amongst posterity"
  37,130,Peace upon Elyasin
  37,131,"verily, thus do we reward those who do well"
  37,132,"verily, he was of our servants who believe"
  37,133,"And, verily, Lot was surely among the apostles"
  37,134,when we saved him and his people altogether
  37,135,except an old woman amongst those who lingered
  37,136,then we destroyed the others
  37,137,"verily, ye pass by them in the morning"
  37,138,and at night; have ye then no sense
  37,139,"And, verily, Jonah was amongst the apostles"
  37,140,when he ran away into the laden ship
  37,141,and he cast lots and was of those who lost
  37,142,"and a fish swallowed him, for he was to be blamed"
  37,143,and had it not been that he was of those who celebrated God's praises
  37,144,he would surely have tarried in the belly thereof to the day when men shall be raised
  37,145,But we cast him on to the barren shore; and he was sick
  37,146,and we made to grow over him a gourd tree
  37,147,and we sent him to a hundred thousand or more
  37,148,and they believed; and we gave them enjoyment for a season
  37,149,"Ask them, 'Has thy Lord daughters while they have sons"
  37,150,or have we created the angels females while they were witnesses
  37,151,is it not of their lie that they say
  37,152,"God has begotten?' verily, they are liars"
  37,153,Has he preferred daughters to sons
