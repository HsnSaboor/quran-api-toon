quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,21,"Thus did we make their people acquainted with their story, that they might know that God's promise is true; and that the Hour, there is no doubt concerning it. When they disputed amongst themselves concerning their affair, and said, 'Build a building over them, their Lord knows best about them;' and those who prevailed in their affair said, 'We will surely make a mosque over them"
  18,22,"They will say, 'Three, and the fourth of them was their dog:' and they will say, 'Five, and the sixth of them was their dog:' guessing at the unseen: and they will say, 'Seven, and the eighth of them was their dog.' Say, 'My Lord knows best the number of them; none knows them but few.' Dispute not therefore concerning them save with a plain disputation, and ask not any one of them concerning them"
  18,23,"And never say of anything, 'Verily, I am going to do that to-morrow"
  18,24,"except 'if God please;' and remember thy Lord when thou hast forgotten, and say,' It may be that my Lord will guide me to what is nearer to the right than this"
  18,25,They tarried in their cave three hundred years and nine more
  18,26,"Say, 'God knows best of their tarrying. His are the unseen things of the heavens and the earth - He can see! and hear!' They have no patron beside Him, nor does He let any one share in His judgment"
  18,27,"So, recite what thou art inspired with of the Book of thy Lord; there is no changing His words; nor shalt thou ever find a refuge beside Him"
