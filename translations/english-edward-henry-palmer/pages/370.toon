  26,61,"and when the two hosts saw each other, Moses' companions said, 'Verily, we are overtaken"
  26,62,"Said he, 'Not so; verily, with me is my Lord, He will guide me"
  26,63,"And we inspired Moses, 'Strike with thy rod the sea;' and it was cleft asunder, and each part was like a mighty mountain"
  26,64,And then we brought the others
  26,65,And we saved Moses and those with him all together
  26,66,then we drowned the others
  26,67,"and that is a sign: but most of them will never be believers"
  26,68,"And, verily, thy Lord He is mighty, merciful"
  26,69,And recite to them the story of Abraham
  26,70,"when he said to his father and his people, 'What do ye serve"
  26,71,"They said, 'We serve idols, and we are still devoted to them"
  26,72,"He said, 'Can they hear you when ye call"
  26,73,"or profit you, or harm"
  26,74,"They said, 'No; but we found our fathers doing thus"

  26,76,ye and your fathers before you
  26,77,"Verily, they are foes to me, save only the Lord of the worlds"
  26,78,who created me and guides me
  26,79,and who gives me food and drink
  26,80,And when I am sick He heals me
  26,81,"He who will kill me, and then bring me to life"
  26,82,and who I hope will forgive me my sins on the day of judgment
  26,83,"Lord, grant me judgment, and let me reach the righteous"
