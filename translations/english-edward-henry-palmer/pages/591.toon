quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the heaven and by the night star
  86,2,And what shall make thee know what the night star is
  86,3,The star of piercing brightness
  86,4,"Verily, every soul has a guardian over it"
  86,5,Then let man look from what he is created
  86,6,he is created from water poured forth
  86,7,that comes out from between the loins and the breast bones
  86,8,"Verily, He is able to send him back again"
  86,9,on the day when the secrets shall be tried
  86,10,and he shall have no strength nor helper
  86,11,By the heaven that sends back the rain
  86,12,And the earth with its sprouting
  86,13,"Verily, it is indeed a distinguishing speech"
  86,14,and it is no frivolity
  86,15,"Verily, they do plot a plot"
  86,16,But I plot my plot too
  86,17,let the misbelievers bide; do thou then let them bide awhile
  87,1,Celebrated the name of thy Lord most High
  87,2,who created and fashioned
  87,3,and who decreed and guided
  87,4,and who brings forth the pasture
  87,5,and then makes it dusky stubble
  87,6,"We will make thee recite, and thou shalt not forget"
  87,7,"save what God pleases. Verily, He knows the open and what is concealed"
  87,8,and we will send thee easily to ease
  87,9,"wherefore remind, for, verily, the reminder is useful"
  87,10,But he who fears will be mindful
  87,11,but the wretch will avoid it
  87,12,he who will broil on the great fire
  87,13,and then therein shall neither die nor live
  87,14,Prosperous is he who purifies himself
  87,15,and remembers the name of his Lord and prays
