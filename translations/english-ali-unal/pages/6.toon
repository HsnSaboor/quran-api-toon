quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,30,"Remember (when) your Lord said to the angels: \"I am setting on the earth a vicegerent.\" The angels asked: \"Will you set therein one who will cause disorder and corruption on it and shed blood, while we glorify You with Your praise (proclaim that You are absolutely free from any defect and that all praise belongs to You exclusively,) and declare that You alone are all-holy and to be worshipped as God and Lord.\" He said: \"Surely I know what you do not know"
  2,31,"(Having brought him into existence, God) taught Adam the names, all of them. Then (in order to clarify the supremacy of humankind and the wisdom in their being created and made vicegerent on the earth), He presented them (the things and beings, whose names had been taught to Adam, with their names) to the angels, and said, \"Now tell Me the names of these, if you are truthful (in your praising, worshipping, and sanctifying Me as My being God and Lord deserves)"
  2,32,"(In acknowledgement of their imperfection, and their perception of the truth of the matter, the angels) said: \"All-Glorified You are (in that You are absolutely above having any defect and doing anything meaningless, and Yours are all the attributes of perfection). We have no knowledge save what You have taught us. Surely You are the All-Knowing, the All-Wise"
  2,33,"(In order to demonstrate the superiority of humankind more clearly, God) said: \"O Adam, inform them of these things and beings with their names.\" When he (Adam) informed them with their names, He said (to the angels), \"Did I not tell you that I know the unseen of the heavens and the earth, and I know all that you reveal and all that you have been concealing"
  2,34,"And (remember) when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate before Adam!\" They all prostrated, but Iblis did not; he refused, and grew arrogant, and displayed himself as an unbeliever"
  2,35,"O Adam! Dwell you, and your spouse, in the Garden, and eat (of the fruits) thereof to your hearts’ content where you desire, but do not approach this tree, or you will both be among the wrongdoers"
  2,36,"But Satan (tempting them to the forbidden tree despite Our forewarning,) caused them both to deflect therefrom and brought them out of the (happy) state in which they were. And We said, \"Go down, all of you, (and henceforth you will live a life,) some of you being the enemies of others. There shall be for you on the earth a habitation and provision until an appointed time"
  2,37,"(Aware of his lapse and in the hope of retrieving his error, rather than attempting to find excuses for it,) Adam received from his Lord words that he perceived to be inspired in him (because of his remorse, and he pleaded through them for God’s forgiveness). In return, He accepted his repentance. He is the One Who accepts repentance and returns it with liberal forgiveness and additional reward, the All-Compassionate (especially towards His believing servants)"
