quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,77,Do they not know that surely God knows what they keep concealed and what they disclose
  2,78,"Among them are the illiterate folk who do not know anything about the Book except fancies from hearsay, and merely follow their conjectures"
  2,79,"Woe, then, to those who write the Book with their hands (interpolating into it their readings of the Scriptures and their explanatory notes thereto, stories from their national history, superstitious ideas and fancies, philosophical doctrines and legal rules) and then in order to sell it for a trifling price (such as worldly benefit, status, and renown), they declare: \"This is from God.\" So woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they have earned (of the worldly income and the sin thereby)"
  2,80,"They say (despite all that): \"The Fire will not touch us at all except for a certain number of days.\" Say, then, (to them): \"Have you made a covenant with God and received a promise from Him? If so, God will never break His covenant. Or do you say things against God that you do not know"
  2,81,"(It is indeed the case that you speak in ignorance. The truth is,) rather, that whoever earns an evil (by his free will) and his vices engulf him – those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein"
  2,82,"While those who believe and do good, righteous deeds, those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein"
  2,83,"And (remember) when We took a promise from the Children of Israel: You shall worship none save God (as the only Deity, Lord and Sovereign), and do good to parents in the best way possible, and to the near (relatives), to the orphans, and to the destitute; and speak kindly and well to the people; and establish the Prayer, and pay the Prescribed Purifying Alms. But then you turned away in aversion, all except a few of you; in fact you are a people always avoiding your compacts and responsibilities"
