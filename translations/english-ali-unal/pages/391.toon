quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,44,"(All that We have told you about Moses and the Book granted to him is a Revelation We reveal to you, O Muhammad, for) you were not present on the spot lying to the western side (of the valley) when We decreed the Commandment (the Torah) to Moses, nor were you a witness (to what happened there)"
  28,45,"But (after them) We brought into being many generations and long indeed were the ages that passed over them. (The information you give about them is also that which We reveal to you, just as what you tell about what happened concerning Moses in Midian is also a Revelation. For) neither did you dwell among the people of Midian so that you are conveying to them (the Makkan people) Our Revelations (about what Moses did in Midian). Rather, We have been sending Messengers (to convey Our Revelations)"
  28,46,"And neither were you present on the side of the Mount Sinai when We called out (to Moses), but (We reveal all this to you) as a mercy from your Lord so that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, so that they may reflect and be mindful"
  28,47,"(We have sent you as Messenger) lest they say when a disaster befalls them (either in the world or in the Hereafter) because of what they themselves with their own hands have forwarded, \"Our Lord! If only you had sent a Messenger to us, we would have followed Your Revelations and been among the believers"
  28,48,"And yet, now that the truth has come to them from Us (through a Messenger), still they say (by way of an excuse for their denial of it), \"Why has he not been granted the like of what Moses was granted (all at once)?\" Did they not preject previously belief refuse to believe in what had been granted to Moses? They said: \"Both are sorcery, each supporting the other.\" They also said: \"In each we are unbelievers"
  28,49,"Say (to them): \"Then bring another Book from God which would offer better guidance than either of these two so that I may follow it, if you are truthful (in your claim that they are both sorcery)"
  28,50,"If they cannot respond, then know that they are merely following their whims and caprices. Who can be more astray than he who follows his lusts and fancies deprived of all guidance from God. God surely does not guide people given to wrongdoing and injustice"
