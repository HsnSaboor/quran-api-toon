  16,27,"Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and will say: \"Where are (those beings whom you claimed) as partners with Me and for whose sake you used to oppose (the believers), defying and disobeying (My guidance)?\" Those who (in their lifetime) were endowed with the Knowledge declare: \"Disgrace and evil are, this day, on the unbelievers"
  16,28,"Those whose souls the angels take while they are still wronging themselves (by falsely associating partners with God, and committing evils). (When they see the punishment), they offer full submission, (saying in an attempt to excuse themselves): \"We did not (mean to) do any evil.\" (But they are answered:) \"No! Surely God has full knowledge of what you were doing (and your intentions therein)"
  16,29,"So, go in through the gates of Hell to abide therein.\" How evil, indeed, is the dwelling of the arrogant (those too haughty to accept God’s guidance)"
  16,30,"Whereas it is said to those who keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety: \"What is it that your Lord sends down (on the Messenger)?\" They answer: \"That which is purely good and to our benefit (in both worlds).\" For those devoted to doing good in this world, aware that God is seeing them, there is good, and the abode of the Hereafter is indeed better. How excellent, indeed, is the abode of the God-revering, pious"
  16,31,"Gardens of perpetual bliss which they will enter, through which rivers flow. Therein they will have whatever they may desire. Thus does God reward the God-revering, pious –"
  16,32,"Those whose souls the angels take whilst they are in a pious state (free of evil, and worshipping none but God alone), saying: \"Peace be upon you! Enter Paradise for what you have been doing"
  16,33,"Are they (the unbelievers and/or those who associate partners with God) but waiting for the angels to come to them (to take their souls or bring them a disaster), or for your Lord’s command (to judge them and open Hell for them)? Even so did those before them. God did not wrong them but they did wrong themselves"
  16,34,"Then the evil consequences of what they used to do fell upon them, and that which they were mocking overwhelmed them"
