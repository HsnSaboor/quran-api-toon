quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  20,126,"(God) says: \"Just so. Our Revelations came to you but you disregarded them, so today you will be disregarded"
  20,127,"Thus do We recompense him who is wasteful (of his God-given faculties) and commits excesses, and does not believe in his Lord’s Revelations. And indeed, the punishment in the Hereafter is more severe and most enduring"
  20,128,"Is it not a guidance for them how many a generation We have destroyed before them, in whose ruined dwelling-places they walk about (in the present)? Surely in that there are signs (manifesting the truth) for people of discernment"
  20,129,"Had it not been for a decree already issued by your Lord, and for a term already appointed (by Him), the judgment (against them) would certainly have been given and executed"
  20,130,"Therefore, be patient (O Messenger) with whatever they say and glorify your Lord with praise before sunrise and before sunset, and glorify Him during some hours of the night – as well as glorifying (Him) at the ends of the day – so that you may obtain God’s good pleasure and be contented (with what God has decreed for you)"
  20,131,"Do not strain your eyes toward what We have given some groups among them to enjoy (in this worldly life), the splendor of the present, worldly life, so that We may test them thereby.

  20,132,"Order your family and community to establish the Prayer, and be diligent in its observance. We do not ask you to provide for Us; rather it is We Who provide for you. (So all your worship is for your own benefit.) And the (desired) outcome is in favor of piety and righteousness"
  20,133,"And they say: \"If only he brought us a miracle from his Lord!\" Has there not come to them (as a sufficient miracle) a Clear Evidence of (the truth) in what is (to be found) in the former Scriptures"
  20,134,"Had We destroyed them with a punishment before it (before the Evidence came to them), they would surely have said: \"Our Lord! If only You had sent us a Messenger, we would have followed Your Revelations before we were humiliated and disgraced"
  20,135,"Say: \"Everyone (we and you) is in an expectation (of what the future will bring), so continue to expect! You will soon come to know who have been the followers of the even path and who have been rightly guided (and therefore whose expectations have proved true)"
