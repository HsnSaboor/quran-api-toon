quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  12,70,"Then when he had provided them with their provisions, he put the drinking-cup (belonging to him) in his brother’s saddlebag (as a gift). Then, (as they had just departed on their return) a herald called out: \"O you people of the caravan! You are surely thieves"
  12,71,"They said, turning towards them (the herald and his companions): \"What is it that you are missing"
  12,72,"They said: \"We are missing the king’s goblet, and whoever brings it shall receive a camel-load (as reward).\" (And the herald added:) \"I have pledged myself to recovering it"
  12,73,"They (the brothers) said: \"By God! Certainly you know well that we did not come to provoke disorder and corruption in this land, and we have never been thieves"
  12,74,"They said: \"What, then, shall be the penalty for it if you are proved liars"
  12,75,"They said: \"The penalty for it is: the (freedom of the) one in whose saddlebag it is found is the penalty for it. That is how we recompense the wrongdoers (who steal)"
  12,76,"(So they were brought back before Joseph to be searched.) He began with their sacks before his brother’s sack; and then he brought the drinking-cup out of his brother’s sack. In this way We made an arrangement for Joseph. Under the king’s law, he could not have detained his brother, had not God so willed. Whomsoever We will, We raise in ranks. Above every owner of knowledge there is (always) one more knowledgeable (until God Who is the All-Knowing)"
  12,77,"They (the other brothers) said: \"If he has stolen – well, a brother of his stole before.\" But Joseph (endured their false accusation in silence and) held it secret in his soul and did not disclose it to them. He said (to himself): \"You are indeed in a bad situation. God has full knowledge of (the truth of) what you allege"
  12,78,"O minister!\" they said: \"He has a father, a very old man; so take one of us in his place. We see that you are indeed of those devoted to selfless kindness"
