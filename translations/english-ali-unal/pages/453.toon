quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  38,1,"Sad. (I swear) by the glorious Qur’an bearing the Reminder (with guidance to the truth and warning, that you are one who has been sent to convey God’s Religion)"
  38,2,"However, those who disbelieve are lost in self-glory and opposition"
  38,3,We destroyed before them many generations (who likewise willfully persisted in unbelief and opposition). (In the end) they called out for help but only when it was too late for the punishment (they had earned) to be canceled
  38,4,"They deem it strange that a warner from among them has come to them, and the unbelievers say: \"This man is but a sorcerer, a fraud (who makes fabrications in attribution to God)"
  38,5,"What! has he made all the deities into One God. This is a very strange thing, indeed"
  38,6,"The leaders among them went about inciting one another: \"Move on, and remain constant to your deities. Surely that (to which this man calls) is the very thing that is certainly intended (deliberately plotted by him and those who follow him)"
  38,7,We have not heard of this in recent ways of faith. This is surely nothing but a concoction
  38,8,"From among all of us has the Reminder been sent down on him?\" No! Rather, (on account of their self-glory) they are lost in doubts concerning My Reminder. No indeed! they have not yet tasted My punishment (so that they might abandon their arrogance and recognize the truth)"
  38,9,"Or do they own and control the treasures of the Mercy of your Lord, the All-Glorious with irresistible might, the All-Bestowing, (that they presume to object to your being chosen as the Messenger)"
  38,10,Or do they own the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them? Then let them ascend to the heavens by ropes (and see if they can prevent the Message from being sent to you)
  38,11,They are no more than a routed band of (disunited) parties there (awaiting a defeat as certain as the defeat of the hordes of old times who rejected the Messengers and were utterly abased)
  38,12,"Before them the people of Noah denied (their Messenger), and the Ad, and the Pharaoh with formidable strongholds"
  38,13,"And also the Thamud, and the people of Lot, and the people al-Aykah. Those are the hordes (of old times)"
  38,14,"Not one of them but denied the Messengers (sent to them), and therefore My retribution was their just, inevitable due"
  38,15,"These wait but for a single blast, which will tolerate no delay (to give them respite)"
  38,16,"Yet, they say: \"Our Lord! Hasten on to us our share before the Day of Reckoning"
