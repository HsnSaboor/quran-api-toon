quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  20,77,"We revealed to Moses: \"Set forth with My servants by night, and (when you reach the sea’s edge with the Pharaoh and his army in pursuit) strike for them a dry path with your staff through the sea, and you need have no fear of being overtaken (by Pharaoh) or of drowning in the sea"
  20,78,"Then the Pharaoh pursued them with his armed hosts, and they were overwhelmed by the sea to their complete destruction"
  20,79,The Pharaoh had led his people astray (and finally he led them to destruction); he did not guide them (either to the truth or to prosperity)
  20,80,O Children of Israel! We saved you from your enemy; and We made a covenant with you through Moses on the right side of Mount Sinai (and granted you the Torah); and We sent down on you manna and quails (to sustain you in the desert)
  20,81,"(We said:) Eat of the pure, wholesome things that We have provided for you but do not exceed the bounds therein (by wastefulness, ingratitude, unlawful earnings, and the like). Otherwise My condemnation will justly fall upon you, and upon whoever My wrath falls, he has indeed thrown himself into ruin"
  20,82,"Yet I am surely All-Forgiving to whoever repents and believes and does good, righteous deeds, and thereafter keeps himself on the right path"
  20,83,"(When Moses came to Our appointment with him in Mount Sinai to receive the Torah, We asked him:) \"Moses, what has caused you to leave your people behind in such haste"
  20,84,"He replied: \"They are following in my footsteps; and I have shown haste to come to You so that You may be well-pleased with Me"
  20,85,"(God) said: \"Then (know that) We have put your people to a test in your absence, and the Samiri (Samaritan) has led them astray"
  20,86,"So Moses returned to his people in anger and sorrow. He said: \"My people! Did your Lord not make you a fair promise (that He would grant you the Torah for your happiness in both worlds and settle you in the land the environs of which He has blessed)? Did, then, the time appointed (for my absence) seem too long to you or did you desire that a condemnation from your Lord should fall upon you, that you broke your promise to me"
  20,87,"They said: \"We did not break our promise to you of our own accord (with intent), but we were loaded with (sinful) loads of ornaments of the people (of Egypt), and we threw them (to get rid of them), in the same way as the Samiri threw (them, into a fire)"
