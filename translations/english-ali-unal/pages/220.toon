quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,98,"If only there had been a community that believed (just when God’s decree of punishment was issued) and profited by their belief – there was none except the people of Jonah. When they came to believe We withdrew from them the punishment of disgrace in the life of this world, and We allowed them to enjoy life for a term"
  10,99,"If your Lord had so willed (and, denying them free will, compelled humankind to believe), all who are on the earth would surely have believed, all of them. Would you, then, force people until they become believers"
  10,100,It is not for any person to believe save by God’s leave. God sets those who do not use their reason in a mire of uncleanness
  10,101,"Say: \"Consider what there is (and what happens) in the heavens and on the earth.\" But all such signs (of the truth of the essentials of faith) and the warnings cannot avail a people who will not believe"
  10,102,"For what do they watch and wait but the like of the days of punishment which befell those (unbelievers) who passed away before them? Say: \"Then watch and wait, and I will be with you watching and waiting"
  10,103,Then We save Our Messengers and those who believe (as We always did before). We have bound Ourselves to save the believers
  10,104,"Say: \"O humankind! If you are in doubt about my religion, then (know that) I do not worship those whom you worship apart from God, but I worship God alone, Who causes you all to die. I have been commanded to be of the believers"
  10,105,"(I have also been commanded:) Set all your being exclusively to the true religion as one with pure faith (free from unbelief and hypocrisy), and never be among those who associate partners with God"
  10,106,"And do not invoke, apart from God, that which can neither benefit you nor harm you; if you did so, then you would be of the wrongdoers (who wrong themselves by committing the greatest wrong of associating partners with God)"
