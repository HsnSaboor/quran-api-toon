quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,O my people! I ask of you no wealth for it (for conveying the Message to you); my wage is due only from God. I will not drive away those who believe; they are destined to meet their Lord (Who will treat them as they should be treated) – whereas I see you as a people acting in ignorance
  11,30,O my people! Who could help me against God were I to drive them away? Will you not then reflect and be mindful
  11,31,"And I do not say to you that with me are the treasures of God, nor do I know the Unseen (what is stored in the future), nor do I say that I am an angel, nor do I say of those, whom your eyes hold in contempt, that God will not grant them some good. God knows best whatever is in their bosoms (what kind of people they are in their inner worlds). (If I drove them away or spoke ill of them), then I would indeed be among the wrongdoers"
  11,32,"They said: \"O Noah! You have argued with us, and have prolonged your arguments; so stop arguing with us and, if you are telling the truth, bring upon us what you have been threatening us with"
  11,33,"Noah said: \"Only God can bring it upon you, if He wills; and you can never be frustrators (of His will)"
  11,34,"My counsel – much as I would counsel you – will not benefit you, if God has willed that you be and remain misguided. He is your Lord (Who created you, and nurtures, sustains and protects you), and you are on the way to return to Him"
  11,35,"Do they (the idolaters) say (of you, O Messenger): \"He has fabricated it (invented all those stories and the Qur’an containing them)?\" Say: \"If indeed I fabricate it, then upon me falls my sin, but (as you are slandering me to excuse your own willful persistence in unbelief, know that) I am free of the sins you have been committing"
  11,36,"And it was revealed to Noah (by Us): \"Never will any of your people believe except those who have already believed. Then, do not be distressed because of what they have been doing"
  11,37,"Build the Ark (which We have described to you) under Our eyes and in accordance with Our instructions to be revealed (to you), and do not plead with Me for those who have persisted in wrongdoing. They are bound to be drowned"
