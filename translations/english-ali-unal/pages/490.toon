quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  43,11,"And Who sends down water from the sky in a measure, and We raise a dead land to life with it. Even so will you be (raised from the dead and) brought forth (from your graves)"
  43,12,"And Who has created all the pairs (of all things), and has enabled for you ships and cattle on which you ride"
  43,13,"So that you sit secure on their backs, then remember and reflect on the favor of your Lord, and when you settle securely on them, say: \"All-Glorified is He Who has subjugated this to our use. We were never capable (of accomplishing this by ourselves)"
  43,14,"And surely, to our Lord we are indeed bound to return"

  43,20,"They also say: \"If the All-Merciful had so willed, we would not have worshipped them (our deities, including angels).\" They have no knowledge whatever of that (the relationship of Divine Will and human will and actions). Indeed, they only judge and speak according to their own fancies and interests"
  43,21,Or did We give them a Book before this (Qur’an) and so they are holding fast to it (and worshipping their false deities by its authority)
  43,22,"Not at all! (Indeed, their only argument is that) they say: \"We have found our forefathers following a certain religion, and we are led in their footsteps"
