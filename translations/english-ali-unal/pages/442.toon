  36,29,"It was but a single blast only, and see! they were extinguished"
  36,30,"Ah! Alas for the servants (of God who fail to serve Him)! Every time there has come to them a Messenger, they have but mocked him"
  36,31,Have they not considered how many a generation We have destroyed before them; they never return to them (nor to their life of the world)
  36,32,"Instead, every generation, all without exception, will be arraigned before us (for judgment)"
  36,33,"A clear sign for them (of God’s Oneness and Lordship) is the dead earth: We revive it and bring forth from it grain, and (following the necessary preparatory processes) they eat of it"
