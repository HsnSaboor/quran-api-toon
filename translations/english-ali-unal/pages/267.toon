quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  15,91,Those who have broken the Qur’an into fragments (as they please)
  15,92,"So, by your Lord, We will surely question them all"
  15,93,About what they have been doing
  15,94,"So from now on, proclaim what you are commanded to convey openly and in an emphatic manner, and do not care (whatever) those who associate partners with God (say and do)"
  15,95,We suffice you against all those who mock
  15,96,Those who adopt some deity along with God. In time they will come to know
  15,97,We certainly know that your breast is constricted by the (blasphemous) things that they say
  15,98,"But glorify your Lord with His praise (proclaim that He is absolutely above having any partners, and that all praise belongs to Him exclusively) and be one of those who prostrate themselves before Him (regularly in the Prayer, which strengthens their humility)"
  15,99,And (continue to) worship your Lord until what is certain (death) comes to you
  16,1,"God’s command (for the calamity to strike the unbelievers and their final destruction at the end of time) is bound to come, so (O unbelievers) do not wish it to be hastened (by asking the Messenger to bring it immediately in order only to deride and cast doubt on it). All-Glorified is He, and absolutely exalted above all that they associate with Him"
  16,2,"He sends down the angels with the Spirit (the life-giving Revelation) from His (absolutely pure, immaterial realm of) command upon whom He wills of His servants (saying): \"Warn people that there is no deity save Me, so keep from disobedience to Me in reverence for Me and piety"
  16,3,"He has created the heavens and the earth in truth (meaningfully and with definite purpose, and on solid foundations of truth). Absolutely exalted is He above all that they associate (with Him)"
  16,4,"He has created human from (so slight a beginning as) a mere drop of seminal fluid; and yet, he turns into an open, fierce adversary (selfishly disputing against the truth)"
  16,5,"And the cattle He has created, from which you get warmth (of clothing) and other uses, and from them you get (food) to eat"
  16,6,And in them there is beauty for you when you drive them home (in the evening) and when you take them out to pasture (in the morning)
