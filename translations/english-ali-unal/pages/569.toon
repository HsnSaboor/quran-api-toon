quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,Though they will be in sight of each other. Every disbelieving criminal will yearn to ransom himself from the punishment of that Day even by his sons
  70,12,And his wife and his brother
  70,13,And all his kinsfolk who sheltered him
  70,14,"And whoever else is on the earth, all of them, so that he might then save himself"
  70,15,By no means! It is a furiously flaming fire
  70,16,Tearing away the skin
  70,17,It will call to itself those who turn their backs (on the call to faith) and turn away (from worship of God)
  70,18,And amass wealth and withhold it (from spending in God’s cause and for the needy)
  70,19,"Surely human has been created with a restless, impatient disposition"
  70,20,Fretful when evil visits him
  70,21,And niggardly when good visits him
  70,22,Except those who are devoted to the Prayer
  70,23,Those who are constant in their Prayer
  70,24,And those in whose wealth there is a right acknowledged (by them)
  70,25,"For such as have no means other than begging, and such as are denied help (because, having self-respect, they cannot beg and are thought to be well-off)"
  70,26,And those who affirm as true the Day of Judgment
  70,27,And those who are fearful of their Lord’s punishment (and live accordingly)
  70,28,"Indeed, their Lord’s punishment is that of which no one can ever feel secure"
  70,29,"And those who strictly guard their private parts, and their chastity and modesty"
  70,30,"Save from their spouses or (as a permission for men) those (bondsmaids) whom their right hands possess, for with regard to them they are free from blame"
  70,31,"But whoever seeks beyond that, such are those who exceed the bounds (set by God)"
  70,32,And those who are faithful to their trusts (which either God or society or an individual places in their charge) and to their pledges (between them and God or other persons or society)
  70,33,And those who are upholders (of right and justice) by bearing true witness and without avoiding giving testimony
  70,34,And those who safeguard their Prayers (including all the rites of which they are constituted)
  70,35,"Those will be in Gardens, high-honored"
  70,36,"What is the matter with those who disbelieve, that (with the intent of mockery) they hasten on toward you with staring eyes fixed on you"
  70,37,"From the right and from the left, in crowds"
  70,38,Does every one of them covet admission into the Garden of bounty and blessing (regarding himself as supremely deserving Paradise without the effort of faith)
  70,39,By no means! We have surely created them out of that (simple matter) which they know very well
