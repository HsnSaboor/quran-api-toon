quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,92,"You will never be able to attain godliness and virtue until you spend of what you love (in God’s cause or to provide sustenance for the needy). Whatever you spend, God has full knowledge of it"
  3,93,"All (kinds of) food (that are lawful in the Law revealed to Muhammad) were lawful to the Children of Israel (in the beginning) except what Israel (i.e. Prophet Jacob) forbade for himself before the Torah was sent down. Say (to them, O Messenger): \"Bring the Torah and recite it, if you are truthful (in your claim that there is no abrogation in it)"
  3,94,"So whoever fabricates falsehood in attribution to God after that (statement, above, of the truth of the matter) – such are the wrongdoers"
  3,95,"Say (O Messenger): \"God speaks the truth.\" Therefore follow the way of Abraham as people of pure faith (a faith free of unbelief, of associating partners with God, and of hypocrisy). He was never of those who associate partners with God"
  3,96,"Behold, the first House (of Prayer) established for humankind is the one at Bakkah (Makkah), a blessed place and a (center or focus of) guidance for all peoples"
  3,97,"In it there are clear signs (demonstrating that it is a blessed sanctuary, chosen by God as the center of guidance), and the Station of Abraham. Whoever enters it is in security (against attack and fear). Pilgrimage to the House is a duty owed to God by all who can afford a way to it. And whoever refuses (the obligation of the Pilgrimage) or is ungrateful to God (by not fulfilling this command), God is absolutely independent of all creatures"
  3,98,"Say: \"O People of the Book! Why do you conceal and disbelieve in God’s Revelations, God being witness to all that you do"
  3,99,"Say: \"O People of the Book! Why do you bar from God’s way those who believe, seeking to make it appear crooked, when you yourselves are witnesses (to its being the right way)? God is not unaware and unmindful of all that you do"
  3,100,"O you who believe! Were you to obey a party of those who were given the Book, they would turn you, after your faith, into unbelievers"
