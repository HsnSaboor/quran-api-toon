quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  35,19,The blind and the seeing are not equal
  35,20,Nor are the depths of darkness and the light
  35,21,Nor the shade and the scorching heat
  35,22,And nor are equal the living and the dead. Surely God makes hear whomever He wills; and you are not one to make hear those who are in the graves
  35,23,You are only a warner (not accountable for their being guided)
  35,24,"Surely We have sent you as Messenger with the truth, as a bearer of glad tidings (of prosperity in return for faith and righteousness) and a warner (against the consequences of misguidance); and there has never been a community but a warner lived among them"
  35,25,"If they deny you, even so denied those before them (to whom a Messenger was sent). Their Messengers came to them with the clear proofs (of their Messengership), Scriptures (full of wisdom and advice), and the Book enlightening (their mind and hearts, and) illuminating (their way)"
  35,26,Then I have seized those who insisted on unbelief. How awesome was My disowning them
  35,27,"Do you not see that God sends down water from the sky? Then We bring forth with it produce of various colors (shapes and taste); and in the mountains there are streaks of white and red, of various colors (due to the flora or the variety of stone and rock), as well as raven-black"
  35,28,"And likewise human beings, and beasts, and cattle, diverse are their colors. Of all His servants, only those possessed of true knowledge stand in awe of God. Surely God is All-Glorious with irresistible might, All-Forgiving"
  35,29,"Those who recite God’s Book (and thereby glorify, praise, and exalt God, and declare His absolute Oneness), and establish the Prayer in conformity with its conditions, and spend out of what We have provided for them (in God’s cause and for the needy) secretly and openly, hope for a trade which will never perish"
  35,30,"For God will pay them their rewards in full, and give them yet more out of His bounty. Surely He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Responsive (to the gratitude of His creatures)"
