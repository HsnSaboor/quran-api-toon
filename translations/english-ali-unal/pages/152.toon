  7,12,"He (God) said: \"What prevented you from prostrating, when I commanded you to do so?\" Iblis said: \"I am better than he, for You have created me from fire, and him You have created from clay"
  7,13,"(God) said: \"Then go down from it; it is not for you to act haughtily there! So be gone! Surely you are of the degraded"
  7,14,"(Iblis) said: \"Grant me respite till the Day when they are raised from the dead"
  7,15,"(God) said: \"You shall be among the ones (humankind) granted respite (so long as they remain on the earth)"
  7,16,"(Iblis) continued: \"Now that You have allowed me to rebel and go astray, I will surely lie in wait for them on Your Straight Path (to lure them from it)"
  7,17,"Then I will come upon them from before them and from behind them, and from their right and from their left. And You will not find most of them thankful"
  7,18,"He (God) said: \"Go away from there, disgraced and disowned! Those of them that follow you, surely I will fill Hell with you all"
  7,19,"(To Adam, He said): \"O Adam! Dwell, you and your spouse, in the Garden, and eat (of the fruits) thereof where you desire, but do not approach this tree, or you will both be among the wrongdoers"
  7,20,"Then Satan made an evil suggestion to both of them that he might reveal to them their private parts that had remained hidden from them (and waken their carnal impulses), and he said: \"Your Lord has forbidden you this tree only lest you should become sovereigns, or lest you should become immortals"
  7,21,"And he swore to them: \"Truly, I am for you a sincere adviser"
  7,22,"Thus he led them on by delusion; and when they tasted the tree, their private parts (and all the apparently shameful, evil impulses in their creation) were revealed to them, and both began to cover themselves with leaves from the Garden. And their Lord called out to them: \"Did I not prohibit you from that tree, and did I not say to you that Satan is a manifest enemy to you"
