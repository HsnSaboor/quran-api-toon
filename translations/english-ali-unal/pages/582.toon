quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,What are they asking each other about
  78,2,About the awesome tidings
  78,3,About which they are in disagreement
  78,4,"No indeed! (They have no need to disagree or question one another about it:) Soon they will come to know"
  78,5,"Again, no indeed! Soon they will come to know"
  78,6,Have We not made the earth as a cradle
  78,7,And the mountains as masts
  78,8,And We have created you in pairs
  78,9,And We have made your sleep for rest
  78,10,And We have made the night as a cloak (covering both you and the world)
  78,11,And We have made the day for seeking livelihood
  78,12,And We have built above you seven firm heavens
  78,13,And We have set up (therein) a lamp blazing and resplendent
  78,14,And We send down out of the rain-clouds water in abundance
  78,15,So that We may produce with it grain and plants
  78,16,And gardens dense and luxuriant
  78,17,"Now assuredly, the Day of Judgment and Distinction is a time appointed (as the result of all that takes place in this world)"
  78,18,The Day when the Trumpet is blown and you all come forth in hosts
  78,19,"And the heaven is opened (for the descent of angels), and becomes as if gates (so that the world of angels and the world of humankind join each other)"
  78,20,And the mountains are set in motion and so become as if they had never existed
  78,21,Surely Hell lies as a place for surveillance
  78,22,"For the (disbelieving) rebellious, (and) a destined home (which they prepared for themselves while in the world)"
  78,23,Wherein they will remain for ages
  78,24,There they will taste neither coolness nor any drink
  78,25,Except boiling water and pus
  78,26,As a recompense fitting (for their sins)
  78,27,For they used not to expect to be called to account (for their deeds)
  78,28,"And denied Our Revelations (and all Our other signs in the universe) with willful, obstinate denial"
  78,29,And every thing (that they did) We wrote down as a record
  78,30,"So: \"Taste (the fruit of your deeds), and We will not increase you except in suffering"
