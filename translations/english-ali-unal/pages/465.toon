quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  39,57,"Or (lest it) should say (by way of invalid excuse): \"If only God had guided me, I would surely have been among the God-revering, pious"
  39,58,"Or (lest it) should say when it sees the punishment, \"If only I had a second chance (to live), so that I could be among those devoted to doing good, aware that God is seeing them"
  39,59,"(But God will answer): \"No, indeed! My Revelations and signs (of the truth) did come to you, but you denied them, and grew in arrogance (so as not to confirm them), and you proved yourself to be one of the unbelievers"
  39,60,On the Day of Resurrection you will see those who fabricated falsehood in attribution to God with their faces darkened by grief and ignominy. Is there not in Hell a dwelling for those (too) arrogant (for faith)
  39,61,"But God will save (from Hell) those who keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety by virtue of what they have achieved (in following God’s way). Evil will never touch them, nor will they grieve"
  39,62,"God is the Creator of all things, and He is the Guardian (with power of disposition) over all things"
  39,63,His are the keys of (the treasures of) the heavens and the earth. So those who disbelieve in God’s Revelations and signs (of the truth) – such are they who are the losers
  39,64,"Say: \"(That being the truth) do you still call me to worship other than God, O ignorant ones"
  39,65,"Indeed it has been revealed to you as well as to those (Messengers) sent before you: \"Should you associate partners with God, your labor will most certainly come to nothing and you will most certainly be among the losers"
  39,66,"Rather: worship God alone, and be among the thankful"
  39,67,"They have no true judgment of God as His right, such as His being God requires, and (such is His Power and Sovereignty that) the whole earth will be in His Grasp on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. All-Glorified is He, and absolutely exalted above what they associate with Him"
