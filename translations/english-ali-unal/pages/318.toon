  20,88,"And then he brought out for them a calf shaping to it (from the molten ornaments) a body (which made a sound like) mooing. Then they said (some of them to others): \"This is your deity and the deity of Moses, but he has forgotten"
  20,89,"Did they not see at all that (even) it could not return to them a word (for answer), and had no power to harm or benefit them"
  20,90,"And Aaron had certainly said to them, before Moses’ return, (warning them:) \"O my people! You are only being tested through this (idol to prove the quality of your understanding and faith). Truly Your Lord is the All-Merciful (Who is most forgiving), so follow me and obey my order"
  20,91,"But they said: \"We will by no means cease to worship it until Moses comes back to us"
  20,92,"(Having returned, and unaware of Aaron’s warning, Moses) said: \"O Aaron! What prevented you, when you saw them gone astray"
  20,93,"From following me? Have you, then, disobeyed my order"
  20,94,"Aaron said: \"O son of my mother! Do not seize me by my beard, nor by my head! I was afraid lest you should say: ‘You have caused division among the Children of Israel, and paid no heed to my orders!’"
  20,95,"(Moses turned to the Samiri and) said: \"What is the matter with you, O Samiri, (that you did such a monstrous thing)"
  20,96,"He answered: \"I have seen something which they were unable to see, and so I took a handful (of dust) from the trail of the messenger (the archangel Gabriel) and cast it into the molten ornaments: thus did my soul prompt me to act"
  20,97,"(Moses) said: \"Be gone, then! (The sentence) upon you is that in this present life you say ‘Touch me not!’ (to warn people against proximity to you), and surely there is for you a promise (of punishment) that you cannot evade. Now look to this deity of yours to whose worship you have become devoted: we will most certainly burn it, and scatter whatever remains of it over the sea"
  20,98,"(O my people!) Your only deity is God, other than Whom there is no deity. He encompasses all things in His Knowledge"
