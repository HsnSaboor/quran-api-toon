quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  15,1,"Alif. Lam. Ra. These are the Revelations of the Book, a Qur’an clear in itself and clearly showing the truth"
  15,2,Again and again will those who disbelieve wish that they had been Muslims
  15,3,"Leave them that they may continue to eat and enjoy themselves, and that hope (for a long, easy life) distract them (from considering their main duty in life and considering their end). In time they will come to know (the truth)"
  15,4,And We did not destroy any township unless it had a known and recorded decree
  15,5,"No community can ever hasten on the end of its term, nor can they delay it"
  15,6,"They say: \"O you, on whom the Reminder (the Book of advice, warning, and instructions) is sent down, truly you are a madman"
  15,7,Why do you not bring down the angels to us if you are truthful (in your claim)
  15,8,"We do not send down the angels save with the truth (for a just reason and with wisdom, not to satisfy vain caprice or curiosity, and once the angels are sent down, the matter is decided, and) then they are allowed no (further) respite"
  15,9,"Indeed it is We, We Who send down the Reminder in parts, and it is indeed We Who are its Guardian"
  15,10,Certainly We sent Messengers before you among the communities of old
  15,11,And there never came to them a Messenger but they did mock him
  15,12,Thus do We cause it (the Qur’an) to pass unheeded through the hearts of the disbelieving criminals
  15,13,"They do not believe in it: for certain the pattern of life of the (sinful) peoples of old times has already passed"
  15,14,Even if (as a miracle to convince them of the truth of God’s Message) We opened to them a gate in heaven and they kept ascending through it all the while
  15,15,"They would say, \"Our eyes are but spellbound; rather, we have been bewitched"
