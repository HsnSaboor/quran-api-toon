quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,He pondered and he calculated (how he could disprove the Qur’an in people’s sight)
  74,19,"Be away from God’s mercy, how he calculated"
  74,20,"Yea, may God preserve him from the evil eye! how he calculated"
  74,21,Then he looked around (in the manner of one who will decide on a matter about which he is asked)
  74,22,Then he frowned and scowled
  74,23,"Then he turned his back and (despite inwardly acknowledging the Qur’an’s Divine origin), grew in arrogance"
  74,24,"And he said: \"This is nothing but sorcery (of a sort transmitted from sorcerers) from old times"
  74,25,This is nothing but the word of a mortal
  74,26,I will make him enter a pit of Hell
  74,27,What enables you to perceive what that pit is
  74,28,"It leaves none (but entirely burns everyone of those thrown into it), nor does it spare anyone (so that they might die and escape)"
  74,29,It scorches up the skin
  74,30,Over it there are nineteen (keepers)
  74,31,"We have appointed none but angels as keepers of the Fire, and We have not caused their number to be anything but a trial for those who disbelieve, that those who were granted the Book before may become certain (that Muhammad, who explains everything revealed to him without any hesitation in the face of all antagonism and derision, is God’s Messenger), and those who believe may grow more firm in faith; and that both they who were granted the Book before and the believers may feel no doubt at all; and those in whose hearts there is a sickness and the unbelievers may say: \"What does God mean by this description?\" Thus God leads astray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills. None knows your Lord’s hosts except He. All this is but a reminder to the mortals (so that they may take heed and act accordingly)"
  74,32,No indeed (the Qur’an is not as the unbelievers claim)! By the moon
  74,33,And by the night when it retreats
  74,34,And by the morning when it shines forth
  74,35,Surely it (the Qur’an) is of the greatest (of God’s signs)
  74,36,A warning for humankind
  74,37,"For everyone of you, whether he goes forward (by choosing faith and good deeds) or hangs back (because his choice of unbelief and sin pulls him away from the Straight Path)"
  74,38,Every person is held in pledge for what he earns (through his deeds)
  74,39,Except the people of the Right (the people of happiness and prosperity who receive their Records in their right hands. God will forgive them and reward them with much more than they earned)
  74,40,"Dwelling in Gardens (whose beauty cannot be perceived while in the world), they will put questions to one another"
  74,41,"About the disbelieving criminals, (and convey the answers they give)"
  74,42,What has brought you into the pit
  74,43,"They will reply: \"We were not of those who prayed (who turn to God in sincere worship)"
  74,44,Nor did we use to feed the destitute
  74,45,We used to plunge (in falsehood and sin) together with those who plunged (in it)
  74,46,And we used to deny the (coming of the) Day of Judgment
  74,47,Until what is certain to come did come upon us
