quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,111,"(Be ever mindful of) the Day when every soul will come pleading for itself, and every soul will be repaid in full for what it did, and none of them will be wronged"
  16,112,"God strikes a parable of a township which was secure and at ease, with its provision coming to it in abundance from all quarters. But it showed ingratitude to God (its people disbelieved, attributed their apparent well-being to other than God and so fell into the habit of making up partners with Him in belief and worship, and daily life); and so God caused it to taste the garment of famine and fear because of what they habitually contrived"
  16,113,"For sure a Messenger from among themselves had come to them, but they denied him, and in consequence, the punishment seized them while they were doing wrong"
  16,114,"So (O people) partake as pure, lawful and wholesome of what God has provided you, and give thanks for His bounty, if it is indeed Him that you worship"
  16,115,"He has made unlawful to you only carrion, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that (the animal) which is offered in the name of other than God. Yet whoever is constrained by dire necessity to eat of them, provided he does not covet (what is forbidden) and does not exceed (the bounds of necessity) – (no sin shall be on him). Surely God is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate"
  16,116,"And do not pronounce for what your tongues falsely describe: \"This is lawful and this is forbidden,\" so that you fabricate falsehood in attribution to God. Surely those who fabricate falsehood in attribution to God do not prosper"
  16,117,"(Their lot is) a brief enjoyment (in this world), and theirs is a painful punishment (in the Hereafter)"
  16,118,And for those who are Jews We made unlawful what We have already related to you. We have never wronged them but they did habitually wrong themselves
