  42,2,‘Ayn. Sin. Qaf
  42,3,"Just so: He reveals to you as (He did) to those (whom He chose as Messengers) before you, (being as He is) God, the All-Glorious with irresistible might, the All-Wise"
  42,4,"His is whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And He is the All-Exalted, the Supreme"
  42,5,"The heavens are all but rent asunder from above them (because of the majesty of Revelation); and the angels glorify their Lord with His praise, and pray for (His establishing a way of guidance for) those on the earth and for forgiveness (of those who follow it). Beware, surely God is He Who is the All-Forgiving, the All-Compassionate"
  42,6,"As for those who take for themselves others besides God for guardians and confidants, (to whom they entrust their affairs, thereby associating partners with Him): God is ever watchful over them, (preserving a record of their deeds). You are not a guardian over them (responsible for their conduct)"
  42,7,"And just so: (as We revealed these truths to the Messengers before you) We reveal to you a Qur’an (a Recitation) in Arabic so that you may warn the mother-city and all those around it, and warn of the Day of Assembly, about (the coming of) which there is no doubt. One party will be in Paradise, and one party in the Blaze"
  42,8,"If God had so willed, He would surely have made them a single community (of the same faith and way of life), but He admits whom He wills into His Mercy. As for the wrongdoers, they have neither a guardian (to protect them), nor a helper"
  42,9,"What? Have they taken for themselves other besides God for guardians and confidants (to whom they entrust their affairs, thereby associating partners with Him)? Rather, God is He Who is the true Guardian, and He will revive the dead, and He has full power over everything"
  42,10,"Whatever you differ on, the final judgment about it is with God. Such is God, my Lord: in Him I put my trust, and to Him I turn in devotion"
