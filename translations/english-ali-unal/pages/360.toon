quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  25,3,"Yet some choose to take, apart from God, deities that create nothing but are themselves created, and have no power to avert harm from, or bring benefit to, even themselves (so that they can give harm or bring benefit to their worshippers), and they have no power over death, nor over life, nor over resurrection"
  25,4,"Those who disbelieve say: \"This (Qur’an) is but a fabrication which he (Muhammad) himself has invented, and some others have helped him with it, so they have produced a wrong and a falsehood"
  25,5,"They also say: \"(It consists of) only fables of the ancients which he has got written. They are being read to him in early mornings and evenings (while people are at home)"
  25,6,"Say: \"(It is a Book full of knowledge revealing many secrets such as no human being could in any wise discover by himself:) He Who knows all the secrets contained in the heavens and the earth sends it down (to teach you some of these secrets and guide you in your life so that you may attain happiness in both worlds). He surely is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate"
  25,7,"Again, they say: \"What sort of Messenger is this? He eats food and goes about in market-places (like any other mortal). Why is an angel not sent down to him so that he may act as a warner in his company (and help him to persuade the people)"
  25,8,"Or: \"Why is a treasure not cast down upon him from the heaven (so that he should no longer need to go about in market-places to earn a living)?\" Or: \"Why does he not have a garden (granted to him miraculously) to obtain his food from?\" And so these wrongdoers say (to the believers): \"You are following only a man bewitched"
  25,9,See how strangely they invent comparisons about you. They have so strayed and are no longer able to find a way (to the truth). excuse
  25,10,"Blessed and Supreme is He Who, if He wills, can grant you (O Messenger) better than all that (they propose): gardens through which rivers flow, and grant you palaces"
  25,11,"But they deny the Last Hour (and this is why they invent such pretexts for their denial of your call. However,) We have prepared a Blaze for whoever denies the Last Hour"
