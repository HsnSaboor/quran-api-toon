quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"Say: \"\"It is not within my power (to deal benefit and harm so) that unless God wills (and allows me to), I can neither bring benefit to, nor avert harm from, even myself. Had I knowledge of the Unseen, I would always be in profit (with no loss at all), and no adversity would ever touch me. I am only a warner (against the evil consequences of misguidance) and a bearer of glad tidings (of prosperity in return for faith and righteousness) for people who will believe and who have already believed"
  7,189,"He it is Who created you from a single human self, and made from it its mate, so that he (inclining with love towards woman) may find rest in her. And so, when he has covered her, she conceives a light burden, and continues to bear it. Then, when she grows heavy (with child), both (feel the need to) turn to God, their Lord, with prayer: \"If You indeed grant us a righteous child, we will most certainly be among the thankful"
  7,190,"Then when He grants the couple a righteous child, they begin to associate partners with God in respect of what He has granted them. Absolutely exalted is He above their association of partners with Him and whatever they associate with Him as partners"
  7,191,Do they associate as partners with Him those who create nothing and themselves are created
  7,192,"And who have no power to give them any help, nor can help themselves"
  7,193,"And if you call them in the direction of guidance, they do not follow you: It is the same for you whether you call to them or remain silent"
  7,194,"Those whom you deify and invoke, apart from God, are subservient beings created by God just like yourselves. (If you think and claim otherwise) then call on them and let them answer you, if you are truthful"
  7,195,"(How can you expect that they will answer:) have they feet on which they could walk; or have they hands with which they could grasp; or have they eyes with which they could see; or have they ears with which they could hear? Say (to them): \"Call upon those you associate with God as partners, then scheme against me, and give me no respite"
