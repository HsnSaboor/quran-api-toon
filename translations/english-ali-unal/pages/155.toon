quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,38,"He (God) says: \"Enter in company with the communities of jinn and humankind that went before you into the Fire!\" Every time a community enters the Fire, it curses its fellow-community (that went before it) – so much so that, when they all have gathered there one after another, those who came later say of those who came earlier: \"Our Lord! Those are the ones who led us astray: give them, therefore, double suffering through fire!\" He (God) says: \"For each is double (since those who went earlier both strayed themselves and led others astray, and those who came later both strayed themselves and imitated the others blindly), but you do not know"
  7,39,"Then the preceding ones among them say to the succeeding ones: \"You are in no wise superior to us, so taste the punishment for all (the sins) that you were busy earning (through your belief and deeds)"
  7,40,"Those who deny Our Revelations and turn arrogantly from them – for them, the gates of Heaven will indeed not be opened (i.e. God will not accept even their good deeds) and they will enter Paradise no further than a camel can pass through the eye of a needle. Thus do We recompense the disbelieving criminals"
  7,41,"For them is a bed of Hellfire and, over them, is a covering (of the same fire). Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers"
  7,42,"But those who believe and do good, righteous deeds – We do not burden any soul beyond its capacity – they are the companions of Paradise; and therein they will abide"
  7,43,"We will strip away whatever is in their bosoms of rancor and any jealousy (they may have felt against other believers while in the world). Rivers flowing beneath them (and themselves overflowing with gratitude), they say: \"All praise and gratitude are for God, Who has guided us to this (prosperity as a result of the guidance with which He favored us in the world). If God had not guided us, we would certainly not have found the right way. The Messengers of our Lord did indeed come with the truth.\" And a voice calls to them: \"That is the Paradise that you have been made to inherit in return for what you used to do (in the world)"
