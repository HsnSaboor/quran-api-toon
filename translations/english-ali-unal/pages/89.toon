quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  4,66,"If We were to ordain for them, \"Lay down your lives (in God’s cause so that you may be purified of your sins)\" or \"Leave your habitations (that you have contaminated with your sins and emigrate to another land in God’s cause),\" they would not do that save a few of them. But if they had done what was urged upon them (before things had come to this point) – if only they would do it from now on – it would indeed have been (and would be) for their own good and (more apt for them) to be more securely established (in the land)"
  4,67,And then We would surely have granted them from Our Presence a tremendous reward
  4,68,"And indeed guided them to a straight path (in belief, thought, feeling and action)"
  4,69,"Whoever obeys God and the Messenger (as they must be obeyed), then those are (and in the Hereafter will be, in Paradise) in the company of those whom God has favored (with the perfect guidance) – the Prophets, and the truthful ones (loyal to God’s cause and truthful in whatever they do and say), and the witnesses (those who see the hidden Divine truths and testify thereto with their lives), and the righteous ones (in all their deeds and sayings and dedicated to setting everything right). How excellent they are for companions"
  4,70,"Such is the grace that is from God, and God suffices as One All-Knowing (of how great that grace is, who deserves it, and the rank of those favored with it)"
  4,71,"O you who believe! (While such great grace is there) be fully prepared, then (as circumstance demands) either go forward in (small) consolidated groups (on military expeditions) or go forward all together"
  4,72,"There are indeed among you such as him who lags behind. Then, if a disaster befalls you, he says: \"Indeed God bestowed His favor upon me that I was not present with them"
  4,73,"But if some bounty from God comes to you, he is sure to say – just as if there had never been any tie of affection between you and him, (and therefore as if there had been an obstacle to his going forth with you) – \"Oh, if only I had been with them, I would have come by a great gain"
  4,74,"So let those who trade the life of this world for the Hereafter fight in God’s cause. Whoever fights in God’s cause, whether he is killed or victorious, We will grant him a tremendous reward"
