quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  98,8,"Their reward is with their Lord: Gardens of perpetual bliss through which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. God is well-pleased with them, and they are well-pleased with Him. That is for him who stands in awe of his Lord"
  99,1,When the earth quakes with a violent quaking destined for it
  99,2,And the earth yields up its burdens
  99,3,"And human cries out, \"What is the matter with it?\" –"
  99,4,On that day she will recount all its tidings
  99,5,As your Lord has inspired her to do so
  99,6,"On that day all humans will come forth in different companies, to be shown their deeds (that they did in the world)"
  99,7,"And so, whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it"
  99,8,And whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it
  100,1,By the chargers that run panting
  100,2,Striking sparks of fire
  100,3,Rushing to make sudden raids at morn
  100,4,Raising thereby clouds of dust
  100,5,"Storming thereby into a host, cleaving it"
  100,6,Surely human is ungrateful to his Lord
  100,7,And to this he himself is a sure witness
  100,8,And most surely he is violent in love of wealth
  100,9,Does he think he will not come to know when all that is in the graves is raised and brought out
