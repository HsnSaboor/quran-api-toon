quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,62,"This is indeed the true narrative; and there is no deity but God, and truly God is the All-Glorious with irresistible might, the All-Wise"
  3,63,"If they (still) turn away, be assured that God has full knowledge of those engaged in causing disorder and corruption"
  3,64,"Say (to them, O Messenger): \"O People of the Book, come to a word common between us and you, that we worship none but God, and associate none as partner with Him, and that none of us take others for Lords, apart from God.\" If they (still) turn away, then say: \"Bear witness that we are Muslims (submitted to Him exclusively)"
  3,65,"O People of the Book (Jews and Christians)! Why do you dispute concerning Abraham (whether he was a Jew or a Christian), when both the Torah and the Gospel were not sent down save after him? Will you ever not use your reason"
  3,66,"Indeed, you are such people that you dispute concerning even a matter about which you have knowledge; why, then, should you dispute on a matter about which you have no knowledge? God knows, but you do not know"
  3,67,"Abraham was not a Jew, nor a Christian; but he was one pure of faith and Muslim (who submitted to God with a sound heart). He was never of those who associate partners with God"
  3,68,"Surely those of humankind who have the best claim to relationship with Abraham are those who followed him (during the term of his mission), and this (most illustrious) Prophet, and those (in his company) who believe. God is the confidant and guardian of the believers (to Whom they can entrust their affairs and on Whom they can rely)"
  3,69,"A party of the People of the Book wish that they could lead you astray; yet they lead none astray except themselves, but they do not perceive (that this is so)"
  3,70,"O People of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in God’s Revelations (the clear proofs of truth), when you yourselves bear witness (to their truth in your own Books)"
