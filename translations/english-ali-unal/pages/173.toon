quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,171,"And (remember) when We shook the Mount above them as if it were a canopy, and they thought that it was going to fall on them. (We said:) Hold firmly to (the Book) that We haven given you and be mindful of (the commands and warnings) that it contains, that you may attain piety and due reverence for God, so deserving His protection (against any kind of deviancy and its consequent punishment in both this world and the Hereafter)"
  7,172,"And (remember, O Messenger,) when your Lord brought forth from the children of Adam, from their loins, their offspring, and made them bear witness against themselves (asking them:) \"Am I not your Lord?\" They said: \"Yes, we do bear witness.\" (That covenant was taken) lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, \"We were indeed unaware of this (fact that you are our Lord)"
  7,173,"Or lest you should say (in trying to excuse yourselves): \"Our forefathers used to associate partners with God before us, and we were their offspring just following after them. Will You, then, ruin us for what those did who rejected Your Lordship and invented that false way (of associating partners with You)"
  7,174,"And thus We set out in detail the signposts of Our way and the relevant Revelations (included in the Qur’an), so that they may turn back (from their wrong ways to Us)"
  7,175,"Tell them (based on Our Revelation) the story of him whom We made well-informed of Our signs and Revelations, but he cast them off, and Satan overtook him, and he became of those (followers of Satan) who rebel (against God’s way) and go astray"
  7,176,"If We had willed (to impede the way he chose by his free will), We could indeed have lifted him (toward the perfections enabled by faith) through those signs and Revelations, but (by his own free choice) he clung to the earth and followed his desires. So (in his being surrendered to greed), his likeness is that of a dog: if you move to drive it away, it pants with its tongue lolling out (still hoping to be fed more), or if you leave it, it pants with its tongue lolling out. Such is the likeness of those who deny Our signs and Revelations. So tell them this narrative so that they may (be stirred to) reflect"
  7,177,"How evil an example are the people who deny Our signs and Revelations, and (in so doing) are ever wronging themselves"
  7,178,"He whom God guides, he is indeed rightly guided; and he whom He leads astray – they are the losers"
