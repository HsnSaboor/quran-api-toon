  37,103,"Then when both had submitted to God’s will, and Abraham had laid him down on the side of his forehead"
  37,104,"(At just that moment,) We called out to him: \"O Abraham"
  37,105,You have already fulfilled the dream (which tested your loyal obedience to the command; so you no longer have to offer your son in sacrifice.) Thus do We reward those devoted to doing good as if seeing God
  37,106,"Behold, all this was indeed a trial, clear"
  37,107,And We ransomed him with a sacrifice tremendous in worth
  37,108,And We left for him among later-comers (until the end of time this greeting and remembrance of him and his Message)
  37,109,Peace be upon Abraham
  37,110,Thus do We reward those devoted to doing good as if seeing God
  37,111,Surely he was one of Our truly believing servants
  37,112,We gave him the glad tidings of Isaac to be a Prophet among the righteous
  37,113,"We showered Our blessings on both him (Ishmael) and on Isaac; and among the offspring of both there have been those devoted to doing good, aware that God is seeing them, and those who have plainly been wronging themselves (by sinning)"
  37,114,We assuredly bestowed Our favor also upon Moses and Aaron
  37,115,And We saved them and their people from the mighty distress (of slavery and persecution)
  37,116,"And We helped them, so they became the victors"
  37,117,"And We granted them both (Moses and Aaron) the clear Book (which explained the matters that had been secret, and which the people needed for the happiness of their life in both worlds)"
  37,118,We showed them the Straight Path (enabling them to follow it in every matter without any deviance)
  37,119,"And We left for them among later-comers (until the end of time, this greeting and remembrance of them and their Message)"
  37,120,Peace be upon Moses and Aaron
  37,121,Thus do We reward those devoted to doing good as if seeing God
  37,122,Surely those two were among Our truly believing servants
  37,123,And surely Ilyas (Elijah) was one of the Messengers
  37,124,"(Remember) when he said to his people: \"Will you not keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety"
  37,125,Will you continue to invoke Ba‘l (as deity) and forsake the Creator Who creates everything in the best and most appropriate form and has the ultimate rank of creativity –
  37,126,"God, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers"
