quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  57,4,"He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six days, then He established Himself on the Throne. He knows whatever goes into the earth (such as rain and seeds), and whatever comes forth out of it (such as moisture, plant and animal life-forms), and whatever descends from the heaven (such as rain, light, and angels), and whatever ascends into it (such as vapor, and supplications). And He is with you wherever you may be. And God sees well all that you do"
  57,5,"To Him belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. To God are all matters ultimately referred, (and whatever He wills occurs)"
  57,6,He makes the night pass into the day and He makes the day pass into the night (and so makes each grow longer or shorter). And He has full knowledge of whatever lies (hidden) in the bosoms
  57,7,"Believe in God and His Messenger, and spend (in God’s cause) out of all that He has entrusted to you – those among you who believe and spend (in God’s cause), for them there is a great reward"
  57,8,"What is the matter with you that you do not believe in God (as His being God requires), when the Messenger calls you to believe in your Lord (Who has created and sustains you), and He has indeed taken your pledge, if you are true believers"
  57,9,"He it is Who sends down to His servant Revelations clear as evidence and in meaning in order to lead you out of all kinds of darkness into the light. Surely God is All-Pitying, All-Compassionate toward you"
  57,10,"What is the matter with you that you do not spend in God’s cause, when God’s is the inheritance of the heavens and the earth. Not equal among you are those who spend before the victory comes and fight (for God’s sake, and those who do not): they are greater in rank than those who spend after the victory comes and fight later. However to all God has promised what is the best (Paradise). God is fully aware of all that you do"
  57,11,"Whoever lends God a goodly loan, God will increase it manifold (to his credit), and he will have an honorable, generous reward (in addition)"
