quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  7,58,"And the good, pure land: its vegetation comes forth in abundance by its Lord’s leave, whereas from the bad, corrupt land, it comes forth but poorly (like thorny bushes). Thus do We in diverse ways set out the signs (of God’s Existence and Unity and other truths of faith) for the people who give thanks (from the heart and in speech, and in action by fulfilling God’s commandments)"
  7,59,"Indeed We sent Noah to his people as Messenger (to convey Our message to them), and he said: \"O my people! Worship God alone: you have no deity other than Him. Indeed I fear for you the punishment of an awesome day"
  7,60,"The leading ones among his people said: \"We see that you are surely lost in obvious error"
  7,61,"He (Noah) said: \"O my people! There is no error in me. Rather, I am a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds"
  7,62,"I convey to you the messages of my Lord, give you sincere advice, and I know from God that which you do not know"
  7,63,"Why, do you deem it strange that a reminder (a message and guidance) from your Lord should have come to you through a man from among yourselves that he may warn you (against the consequences of your way of life), and that you may guard against His punishment, and so that you may be favored with His grace and mercy"
  7,64,"And yet they (instead of paying heed to Noah’s warning) denied him. And so We saved him and those who were with him in the Ark, and caused to drown those who denied Our Revelations and signs (of Our Existence and Unity). They were indeed a blind people"
  7,65,"And to the (people of) ‘Ad We sent their brother Hud. He said: \"O my people! Worship God alone: you have no deity other than Him. Will you not, then, keep from disobedience to Him and deserve His protection"
  7,66,"The leading ones among his people who were persisting in unbelief said: \"We see you to be indeed foolish and weak-minded, and we are certain that you are a liar"
  7,67,"He (Hud) said: \"O my people! There is no folly and weak-mindedness in me, rather I am a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds"
