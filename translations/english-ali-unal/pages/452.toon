quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you? How can you judge so
  37,155,Will you not still reflect and be mindful
  37,156,Or do you have a clear authority (of evidence)
  37,157,"If so, produce your book (which), if you are truthful in your claim, (must have come from God)"
  37,158,And they have concocted a kin-relationship between Him and the jinn (to excuse their worshipping the jinn); whereas the jinn know quite well that they (are created and sustained by God and) are bound to be arraigned (before Him for judgment)
  37,159,"All-Glorified is He, absolutely exalted above such as they attribute to Him"
  37,160,But God’s servants endowed with sincerity in faith and practicing the Religion do not do so
  37,161,For sure you and those that you worship
  37,162,Cannot cause any to deviate concerning God
  37,163,Except those who have willfully adopted the way to the Blazing Flame
  37,164,"(The angels whom they assert to be God’s daughters say): \"There is none among us but has his duty and position assigned"
  37,165,And surely we are those ranged in ranks (ever-expecting God’s commands)
  37,166,And most certainly we are the ones glorifying Him (declaring Him to be above having any defects and partners)
  37,167,They (the polytheists) surely used to say
  37,168,If only We had had a Reminder of the like those who lived before us had
  37,169,Then we would certainly have been God’s servants endowed with sincerity in faith and practicing the Religion
  37,170,Yet (now the Qur’an has come to them) they disbelieve in it; so they will come to know
  37,171,Indeed Our word (of promise) has already gone forth in respect of Our servants sent with Our Message (of guidance and warning)
  37,172,That they would surely be helped to victory
  37,173,"And that surely Our host (the host of the true believers), they are certainly the victors"
  37,174,"So turn aside from them for a little while, (do not care what they do and say)"
  37,175,"And watch them and see (to what end their denial will lead them), as they also will see it"
  37,176,Or do they seek to hasten on Our punishment (that it befall them immediately)
  37,177,"But when it descends encompassing them, then evil will be the morning of those who have been warned"
  37,178,And ignore what they say and do for a little while
  37,179,"And watch them and see (what the ultimate end of all people will be), as they also will see it"
  37,180,"All-Glorified is your Lord, the Lord of might and glory, exalted above all that they attribute (to Him)"
  37,181,And peace be upon the Messengers
  37,182,"And all praise and gratitude are for God, the Lord of the worlds"
