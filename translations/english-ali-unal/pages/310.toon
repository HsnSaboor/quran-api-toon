quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  19,65,"(He is) the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them; so worship Him alone, and be constant and patient in His worship. Do you know of any whose name is worthy to be mentioned along with His (as Deity and Lord to worship)"
  19,66,"And (despite this, that disbelieving) human says: \"What? Once I am dead, will I then be brought forth alive"
  19,67,Does (that) human not bear in mind that We created him before when he was nothing
  19,68,"And so, by your Lord, We will most certainly raise to life and gather them all together, as well as the satans (of humankind and jinn whom they used to follow), before Us, and then We will most certainly heap them up on their knees in groups around Hell"
  19,69,Then We will certainly pluck out from every group of the same belief the ones who were most obstinate in rebellion against the All-Merciful
  19,70,"Indeed, We know best who deserves most (and before all others) to be thrown into Hell to roast therein"
  19,71,"There is no one among you, (O humankind,) who will not come to it. This is a fixed decree which your Lord has bound Himself to fulfill"
  19,72,"Then We will save those who keep from disobedience to Him in reverence for Him and piety, and We will leave in it the wrongdoers (who associate partners with God or deny Him), humbled on their knees"
  19,73,"When Our Revelations, clear as evidence and in meaning are recited (and conveyed) to them, those who persistently disbelieve say to those who believe: \"Which of the two parties (– you or us –) is superior in status with more impressive dwellings and more imposing as a company"
  19,74,"And yet, how many a generation have We destroyed before them who were superior in respect of possessions and outward show"
  19,75,"Say: \"Whoever is lost in error, no matter how much the All-Merciful adds (to their wealth and how long He prolongs their life-span), when they face what they were promised – whether it be punishment (here in this world) or the Last Hour – they will come to know who is worse in position and weaker in forces"
  19,76,"God strengthens in guidance those who have sought and found guidance. The righteous, good deeds of lasting merit are best in your Lord’s sight for reward, and best for returns"
