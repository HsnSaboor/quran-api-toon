quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  18,84,"We surely established him with power in the land, and for everything (that he rightly purposed) We granted him a way (the just means appropriate to just ends)"
  18,85,One such way he followed
  18,86,"Until, when he reached the setting-place of the sun, he saw it setting in a spring of hot and black muddy water, and nearby he found a people. We said: \"O Dhu’l-Qarnayn! You can either punish them or you can treat them with kindness. (Which way will you choose)"
  18,87,"He said: \"As for him who does wrong (by disbelieving in Him or associating partners with Him and oppressing others) we will punish him and then he is brought back to his Lord, and He punishes him in an indescribable manner"
  18,88,"But as for him who believes and does good, righteous deeds, for him the recompense of the best is due, and we will speak to him an easy word of Our command (we will charge him with easy tasks)"
  18,89,Then he followed another way
  18,90,"Until, when he reached the rising-place of the sun and found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shelter against it"
  18,91,So it was (such was their state and the extent of Dhu’l-Qarnayn’s power). We assuredly encompassed all concerning him in Our Knowledge
  18,92,Then he followed another way
  18,93,"Until, when he reached (a place) between two mountain-barriers, he found before them a people who scarcely understood a word"
  18,94,"They said: \"O Dhu’l-Qarnayn! Gog and Magog are causing disorder in this land. May we pay you a tribute so that you set a barrier between us and them"
  18,95,"He said: \"What my Lord has established me in (the power that He has granted me on this earth) is better (than what you offer). So help me with strength (manpower) and I will set a strong rampart between you and them"
  18,96,"Bring me blocks of iron.\" Then, after he had filled up (the space between) the two steep mountain-sides, he said: \"(Light a fire and) work your bellows!\" At length, when he had made it (glow red like) fire, he said: \"Bring me molten copper that I may pour upon it"
  18,97,"And they (Gog and Magog) were no longer able to surmount, nor were they able to dig their way through (the barrier)"
