quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,"Is he (who derives lessons from God’s acts in the universe and so) whose breast God has expanded to Islam, so that he follows a light from his Lord (– is such a one to be likened to one whose heart is closed up to any remembrance of God and therefore to Islam)? So woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of God (and who learn nothing from His signs and Revelations)! Those are lost in obvious error"
  39,23,"God sends down in parts the best of the words as a Book fully consistent in itself, and whose statements corroborate, expound and refer to one another. The skins of those who stand in awe of their Lord tingle at (the hearing and understanding of) it. Then, their skins and their hearts come to rest in the Remembrance of God (the Qur’an). This is God’s guidance, by which He guides whomever He wills. And whoever God leads astray, there is no guide for him"
  39,24,"Is he who (thrown into the Fire upon his face with his hands chained around his neck,) tries to guard himself with his face (by trying to keep it away) from the evil punishment on the Day of Resurrection (to be likened to one who will be safe from the punishment that Day)? It will be said to the wrongdoers: \"Taste (this Day) what you used to earn (in the world)"
  39,25,"Those before them denied (the Revelation), and so the punishment came upon them without their having perceived from where it came"
  39,26,"Thus God made them taste disgrace in the life of this world, but the punishment of the Hereafter is greater. If only they had known"
  39,27,"Assuredly We have struck for humankind in this Qur’an all kinds of parables and comparisons, so that they may reflect and be mindful"
  39,28,"It is a Qur’an in Arabic with no crookedness (free from any contradiction and anything offensive to truth and righteousness and reason), so that they may keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety to deserve His protection"
  39,29,"God strikes a parable: a man in (the employment of) many partners who continuously dispute with one another, and another man employed by one person: are those two equal in likeness? All praise and gratitude are for God (the only Sovereign Lord of the creation). But most people have no knowledge (of the meaning of this truth)"
  39,30,"You will surely die (one day), and surely they (too) will die"
  39,31,"Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will stand in the Presence of your Lord as litigants"
