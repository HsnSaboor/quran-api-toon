quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,16,It is in the face of such rage and malice that We send down the Qur’an in messages clear in meaning and content and as manifest signs of the truth; and God guides whomever He wills
  22,17,"Those who truly believe (in God and follow Muhammad), and those who have become Jews, and the Sabaeans, and the Christians, and the Magians, and those who associate partners with God (without having any relation with a Divinely-inspired religion) – God will certainly judge between them on the Day of Resurrection. God is witness over everything"
  22,18,"Do you ever consider that all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth prostrate themselves to God, and so do the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, and the beasts, and so do many among human beings? Whereas many others are deservedly condemned to punishment. Whoever God humiliates can have none to give him honor. Assuredly, God does whatever He wills"
  22,19,"These are two opposing groups (– those who prostrate to God and those who do not. Though there may be differences of approach within either group), they contend about (the truth concerning) their Lord. As for those who disbelieve (by categorically denying Him or associating partners with Him in His Attributes or authority as the Lord), garments of fire are certain to be cut out for them, with boiling water being poured down over their heads"
  22,20,"With which all that is within their bodies, as well as their skins, is melted away"
  22,21,For them are also goads and maces of iron
  22,22,"Whenever in their anguish they attempt to come out of the Fire, they will be returned into it (and told): \"Taste the punishment of the scorching Fire"
  22,23,"(On the other hand,) God will admit those who believe and do good, righteous deeds into the Gardens through which rivers flow; adorned therein with armbands of gold and pearls, and their garments therein will be of silk"
