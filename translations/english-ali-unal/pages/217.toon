quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,71,"Relate to them the exemplary history of Noah when he said to his people: \"O my people! If my presence (among you) and my reminding (you) by God’s Revelations are offensive to you – well, in God have I put my trust. So, coming together, decide upon your course of action, and (call to your aid) your (so-called) associates of God, then let not your affair be a worry to you, and then carry out against me (whatever you have decided), and give me no respite"
  10,72,"Then if you turn away (from the Message that I convey to you), then (know that it will cause me no loss, just as your accepting it will gain me nothing) I ask you for no wage; my wage is only due from God, and I have been commanded to be of the Muslims (those who have submitted to Him)"
  10,73,"And yet they denied him, and so We saved him and all who were with him in the Ark, and made them successors (to inherit the earth), while We caused to drown those who denied Our Revelations and all other signs (pointing to Our Existence and Unity).Look, then, how was the outcome for those who were warned (but never paid heed)"
  10,74,"Then, after him, We sent forth Messengers to their people; and they came to them with the clear signs of the truth but they would not believe in that which they used to deny before. Thus do We impress a seal on the hearts of those who exceed the bounds"
  10,75,"Then, after them, We sent forth Moses and Aaron to the Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our signs (miracles to support them), but they grew arrogant (in the face of those signs), and (demonstrated that) they were a guilty people committed to accumulating sins"
  10,76,"When the truth came to them from Us, they said: \"Surely this is clearly nothing but sorcery"
  10,77,"Moses said: \"Do you speak of the truth like this when it has come to you? Is this sorcery? But sorcerers do not prosper"
  10,78,"They said: \"Have you come to us to turn us away from what we found our forefathers following, and that high authority in this land may belong to you two? Never will we believe in you two"
