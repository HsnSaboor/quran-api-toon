quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  61,6,"And Jesus son of Mary said: \"O Children of Israel! Surely I am the Messenger of God sent to you, confirming (whatever of the truth is contained in) the Torah which was revealed before me, and bringing the glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name is Ahmad.\" But when he came to them (the whole of humankind including the later generations of the Children of Israel) with the manifest signs (of his being God’s Messenger), they said: \"This (which he preaches and does) is clearly (nothing but) sorcery"

  61,14,"O you who believe! Be helpers of God(’s cause and Messenger), even as Jesus son of Mary said to his disciples: \"Who will be my helpers (on this way) to God?\" The disciples said: \"We are the helpers (in the cause) of God.\" And so it happened that some of the Children of Israel believed (in him and his Message) and others disbelieved (thus becoming two groups).
