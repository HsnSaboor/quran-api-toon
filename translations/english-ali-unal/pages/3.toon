quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  2,6,"(Despite the commitment and energy you show in striving to help people to believe,) those who willfully persist in unbelief: it is alike to them whether you warn them or do not warn them; (although it is your mission to warn them and you do it without any neglect,) they will not believe"
  2,7,"God has set a seal upon their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a covering. For them is a mighty punishment (in the Hereafter)"
  2,8,"Among people are some who say, \"We believe in God and in the Last Day\", although they are not believers"
  2,9,"They would trick God and those who believe, and they trick only their own selves (of which they are enamored), but they do not perceive"
  2,10,"In the very center of their hearts is a sickness (that dries up the source of their spiritual life, extinguishes their power of understanding and corrupts their character), and (because of their moral corruption and the tricks they deploy out of envy and malice) God has increased them in sickness. For them is a painful punishment because they habitually lie"
  2,11,"(Because of the disorder they intend to provoke with their lies), whenever they are told (as part of the duty enjoined upon the believers to promote good and forbid evil), \"Do not cause disorder and corruption on earth,\" they say: \"Why! We indeed are the ones who set things right"
  2,12,"Beware, they themselves are those who cause disorder and corruption but they are unaware (of what they do and ignorant of what setting things right is and what causing disorder is)"
  2,13,"Again, whenever they are told (as a duty of calling to faith), \"Believe as the people believe,\" (in a way to demonstrate their self-pride and disparagement of the people) they say: \"Shall we believe as the fools believe!?\" Beware, they themselves are the fools, but they do not know (seeing that they have no true knowledge to distinguish between truth and falsehood, sincere faith and hypocrisy, right and wrong)"
  2,14,"When they meet those who believe, they declare (hypocritically), \"We believe;\" but when they are alone in secret with their (apparently human) satans (to whom they hasten in need to renew their unbelief and their pledge to them for fear of losing their support), they say: \"Assuredly we are with you; we only mock (those others)"
  2,15,"(Since what they do only means demanding straying and ridicule,) God returns their mockery, leaving them to wander blindly on in their rebellion"
  2,16,"Such are the ones who have bought straying in exchange for guidance, but their trade has brought no profit, and they have no way out to escape it"
