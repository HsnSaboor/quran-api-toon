quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  67,1,Blessed and Supreme is He in Whose Hand is the Sovereignty; and He has full power over everything
  67,2,"He Who has created death and life, so that He may try you (and demonstrate to yourselves) which of you is better in deeds; and He is the All-Glorious with irresistible might (Whose will none can frustrate), the All-Forgiving (Who forgives many of His servants’ sins so that they learn from being tested)"
  67,3,"He Who has created seven heavens in harmony. You do not see any fault or incongruity in the creation of the All-Merciful. Look yet again: can you see any rifts"
  67,4,"Then look again and yet again, (and however often you do so, with whatever instruments to aid your looking) your sight will fall back to you dazzled (by the splendor of God’s creation), and awed and weakened (being unable to discern any flaw to support any excuse for claiming that there could be any sharing in the dominion of the universe)"
  67,5,"And, indeed, We have adorned the lowest heaven (the heaven of the world) with lamps (stars), and made (out of) them missiles to drive away devils; and for them We have prepared (in the Hereafter) the punishment of the Blaze"
  67,6,And also for those who disbelieve in their Lord is the punishment of Hell. How evil a destination to arrive at

  67,9,"They will say: \"Yes, indeed, a warner came to us but we denied (him) and said (to him): \"God has never sent down anything, you are only in a great error"
  67,10,"They will say: \"If only we had listened (to him) or reasoned (and distinguished what was to our benefit from what was to our harm, and acted accordingly), we would not (now) be among the companions of the Blaze"
  67,11,"Thus will they acknowledge their sins, but God’s mercy will (then) be far from the companions of the Blaze"
  67,12,"As for those who stand in awe of their Lord though unseen (beyond their perception), for them there is forgiveness (to bring unforeseen blessings), and a great reward"
