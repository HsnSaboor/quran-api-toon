quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,"How many a generation We have destroyed before them who were mightier than these in prowess, and overran other lands. But was there any place of escape (for them when God’s punishment became due: is there ever)"
  50,37,"Surely in that is a warning reminder for anyone who has a heart (that is truly alive), and who gives ear (to the one conveying this reminder), with eyes able to see well"
  50,38,"We assuredly created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days, and nothing of fatigue touched us"
  50,39,So (with confident reliance on Our promise and Power) bear with patience whatever they say and glorify your Lord with His praise before the rising of the sun and before its setting
  50,40,"And during (some part of) the night, too, glorify Him, and after the prostrations"
  50,41,And wait with ears able to hear for the Day when the Caller will call out from a place near
  50,42,The Day when they will hear the Blast in truth (as a predetermined decree of God that must happen). That is the Day of the coming forth (when the dead will be raised from their graves)
  50,43,"Surely it is We Who give life and cause to die, and to Us is the homecoming"
  50,44,"That Day the earth will be rent asunder away from them, and they, hurrying out of it (will come to the gathering). That will be a gathering easy for Us"
  50,45,"We know best whatever they say, and you (O Messenger) are not one to compel them (to faith). So remind and warn by the Qur’an him who fears My threat"
  51,1,By those that (like winds) scatter far and wide
  51,2,And those that (like clouds) bear heavy burdens
  51,3,And those (like ships) that run with gentle ease
  51,4,"And those (angels) who distribute by command (of God, His provision of rain and innumerable other blessings)"
  51,5,What you are promised is most certainly true
  51,6,The Last Judgment is bound to take place
