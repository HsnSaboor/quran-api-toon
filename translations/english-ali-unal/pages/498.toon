quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  44,40,Surely the Day of Judgment and Distinction (between the truth and falsehood and the righteous and the sinful) is the time appointed for them all
  44,41,"The Day when no guardian will be of any avail to one supported and protected, and none will be helped"
  44,42,"Save those on whom God will have mercy. Surely He is the All-Glorious with irresistible might (Whose punishment no one can escape), the All-Compassionate (especially toward His believing servants)"
  44,43,(Here is) the tree of Zaqqum
  44,44,The food of him addicted to sinning
  44,45,Like molten brass; it will boil in their bellies
  44,46,Like the boiling of hot water
  44,47,(O angels of Hell!) Take him (the sinful one) and drag him into the midst of the Blazing Flame
  44,48,Then pour over his head boiling water as punishment
  44,49,"Taste! (Only in your own judgment) were you mighty, honorable, and noble"
  44,50,And this (what you are suffering now) is that which you used to doubt
  44,51,"Whereas the God-revering, pious ones will be in a position absolutely secure (from any evil)"
  44,52,Amid gardens and springs (of Paradise)
  44,53,"Dressed in fine silk and silk brocade, (seated) face to face"
  44,54,"Just so it will be. And We will assign for them maidens pure, most beautiful of eye"
  44,55,There they call for every kind of fruit in security (from any harm)
  44,56,"They will not taste death therein, except the first death (of leaving the world); and He has preserved them from the punishment of the Blazing Flame"
  44,57,As a grace from your Lord. That is the supreme triumph
  44,58,"So (to enable you for that triumph) We have made this Qur’an easy to understand by revealing it in your tongue, so that they may remember and be mindful (and order their lives according to it)"
  44,59,"Then wait (O Messenger, and watch (how they react and how they fare); they too are waiting (to see how your mission will fare)"
