quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,"He (a disbelieving, haughty man) frowned and turned away"
  80,2,Because (while he was talking with the Messenger) the blind man approached him
  80,3,What would inform you (O haughty one) but that he might grow in purity (by doing good deeds)
  80,4,"Or that he might grow mindful (of God’s Message), and the reminder benefit him"
  80,5,As for him who deems himself to be independent (not needy of Divine guidance because of pride in his wealth and status)
  80,6,You (O Messenger) attend to him (so that he may accept Islam and reform)
  80,7,Though you are not accountable if he does not grow in purity (through acceptance of faith and fulfilling its obligations and responsibilities)
  80,8,But as for him who came to you eagerly
  80,9,And he was in awe of God
  80,10,You divert your attention from him (to the other)
  80,11,No indeed! It surely is a reminder and an admonition (that suffices for all who come to it with an open heart)
  80,12,So whoever wills receives admonition and takes heed
  80,13,(It is recorded) in scrolls greatly honored
  80,14,"Exalted (in God’s sight) and perfectly purified (of falsehood, vanity, and inconsistency)"
  80,15,(Borne) by the hands of angel-envoys
  80,16,Noble and virtuous
  80,17,Human is ruined – for how thankless and disbelieving he is
  80,18,(Does he never consider) from what thing He has created him
  80,19,From a drop of (seminal) fluid; He has created him and fashioned him in measured proportions (for his shape and for his life)
  80,20,Thereafter He has made the path (to God) easy for him
  80,21,Thereafter He causes him to die and buries him
  80,22,"Thereafter, when He wills, He raises him again to life"
  80,23,No indeed! Human has not fulfilled what God enjoined on him
  80,24,"Then, let human consider his food (and so reflect on his Lord’s Mercy and the truth of Resurrection)"
  80,25,That We pour down the water in abundance
  80,26,Then We split the earth in clefts
  80,27,And so We enable grain to grow therein
  80,28,"And grapes, and edible plants"
  80,29,And olive-trees and date-palms
  80,30,And gardens dense with foliage
  80,31,And (diverse other) fruits and herbage
  80,32,As a means of livelihood for you and your animals
  80,33,But when the piercing Cry (heralding the Resurrection) sounds
  80,34,On that Day when a person flees from his brother
  80,35,And from his mother and father
  80,36,And from his spouse and his children
  80,37,Everyone on that Day has concern of his own enough to make him heedless (of anything else)
  80,38,Some faces will on that Day be radiant with happiness
  80,39,"Smiling, rejoicing at good tidings"
  80,40,And some faces will on that Day be dust-stained
  80,41,Veiled in darkness
  80,42,"Those are the unbelievers, shameless and dissolute"
