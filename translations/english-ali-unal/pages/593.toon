quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the dawn
  89,2,And ten nights
  89,3,And the even and the odd
  89,4,And the night as it journeys on (towards an end)
  89,5,"Is there not in that a solemn oath for one endowed with reason (to reflect upon, so that it may guide him to the truth and keep him away from evils)"
  89,6,Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the (tribe of) ‘Ad
  89,7,(The people of) Iram with many-columned (i.e. monumental) buildings
  89,8,The like of which had not been created in the land
  89,9,"And with (the tribe of) Thamud, who hewed rocks in the valley (to make dwellings)"
  89,10,"And with the Pharaoh, who had formidable strongholds"
  89,11,(All of) these rebelled (and transgressed all bounds) in the lands (where they lived)
  89,12,And increased manifold disorder and corruption therein
  89,13,Therefore your Lord let loose on them a scourge of punishment (coming in different forms)
  89,14,Your Lord is ever on the watch (over human and tests him in the blessings with which He favors him)
  89,15,"And so, human – when his Lord tries him by bestowing favors on him – says: \"My Lord has honored me"
  89,16,"But whenever He tries him by straitening his means of livelihood, then he says, \"My Lord has humiliated me"
  89,17,No indeed! You (O people) do not treat the orphan with kindness and generosity
  89,18,And do not urge one another to feed the destitute
  89,19,And you consume inheritance (belonging to you or others) with greed (without distinction of the lawful and unlawful)
  89,20,And you love wealth with a boundless ardor for it and for hoarding
  89,21,No indeed! When the earth is pounded to dust with pounding after pounding
  89,22,"And your Lord comes (unveils His Power and Majesty), and the angels in row upon row"
  89,23,"And on that Day Hell is brought (forward); on that Day human will come to understand (what being favored with bounties meant and how he should have responded), but what will that understanding (then) avail him"
