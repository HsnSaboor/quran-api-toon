quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,30,"The Day when every soul will find whatever good it has done brought forward, and whatever evil it has done. It will wish that there were a far space between it and that evil. God warns you that you beware of Himself; and God is All-Pitying for the servants"
  3,31,"Say (to them, O Messenger): \"If you indeed love God, then follow me, so that God will love you and forgive you your sins.\" God is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate"
  3,32,"Say (again): \"Obey God, and the Messenger.\" If they still turn away (then know that only the unbelievers turn away from this call, and let them know that) God does not love the unbelievers"
  3,33,"(They refuse belief in you and some of the Prophets because you did not appear among them, but God favors whomever He wishes with Messengership, and) God made pure Adam and Noah and the House of Abraham and the House of ‘Imran, choosing them above all humankind"
  3,34,"As descendants of one another, (and they were following the same way. Therefore, do not, in respect of believing in them as Prophets, make any distinction between the Prophets and do not think or speak ill of God’s preference). God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
  3,35,"(Remember) when the woman (from the House) of ‘Imran entreated: \"My Lord, I have dedicated that which is in my womb to Your exclusive service. Accept it, then, from me. Surely You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing"
  3,36,"When she was delivered of it she said: \"My Lord, I have given birth to a female.\" – God knew best of what she was delivered, (so she did not need to be sorry, because) the male child (she expected) could not be the same as (the) female child (whom We bestowed on her and would honor with a great favor). – I have named her Mary and commend her and her offspring to You for protection from Satan eternally rejected from God’s Mercy"
  3,37,"(In response to her mother’s sincerity and purity of intention in dedicating the child,) her Lord accepted her with gracious favor and enabled to her a good growth (upbringing), and entrusted her to the care of Zachariah. Whenever Zachariah went in to her in the Sanctuary, he found her provided with food. \"Mary,\" he asked, \"how does this come to you?\" \"From God,\" she answered. Truly God provides to whomever He wills without reckoning"
