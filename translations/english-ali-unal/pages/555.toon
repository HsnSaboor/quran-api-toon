quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"When it is said to them, \"Come, and let the Messenger of God ask forgiveness for you (from God),\" they turn away their faces, and you see them drawing back in arrogance"
  63,6,"It is alike for them whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them: God will never forgive them (so that they may return to guidance and hope for happiness in both worlds). God surely does not guide transgressors (whose hearts are infected with irremediable hypocrisy)"
  63,7,"It is they who say (to their comrades): \"Do not spend on those (impoverished Muslims) who are with God’s Messenger, so that they may disperse (from around him).\" But the treasures of the heavens and the earth belong to God (Who provides for whom He wills as He wills, so the hypocrites have no power to withhold anything from those impoverished Muslims). But the hypocrites do not grasp this (being incapable of truth)"
  63,8,"They say: \"For certain, if we return to Madinah, those with more status and power will drive out from it the weaker and lowlier ones.\" But all glory and might belong to God, and (by His leave) to His Messenger and the believers. But (being incapable of knowledge of the truth) the hypocrites do not know this"
  63,9,"O you who believe! Let not your wealth nor your children (distract and) divert you from the remembrance of God. Those who do so, they are the losers"
  63,10,"And spend (in God’s cause and for the needy) out of whatever We provide for you before death comes to any of you and he says: \"My Lord! If only You would grant me respite for a short while, so that I may give alms, and be one of the righteous"
  63,11,But never will God grant respite to a soul when its appointed term has come. God is fully aware of all that you do
