quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  42,32,And among His manifest signs are the ships running through the sea like (floating) hills
  42,33,"If He so wills, He calms the wind and so they lie motionless on its surface. Surely in that are signs for all who are greatly patient and perseverant (in adversity for His sake), and greatly thankful (for His favors)"
  42,34,Or He causes them (the ships) to sink because of what they (the travelers) have earned; and yet He overlooks many (of their wrongs)
  42,35,"Those who dispute concerning Our signs and Revelations should know that they have no (escape, nor any) place of refuge"
  42,36,"Whatever thing you are granted is but for the passing enjoyment of the present, worldly life, but what God keeps for you in the Hereafter is much better and more enduring for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord"
  42,37,"Those who avoid the major sins and indecent, shameful deeds (which are indeed to be counted among major sins), and when they become angry, even then they forgive (rather than retaliate in kind)"
  42,38,"And those who answer the call of their Lord and obey Him (in His orders and prohibitions), and establish the Prayer in conformity with its conditions; and whose affairs are by consultation among themselves; and who spend out of what We provide for them (to provide sustenance for the needy, and in God’s cause)"
  42,39,"And those who, when an unjust aggression is inflicted on (any or all of) them, defend themselves and one another (to end the aggression)"
  42,40,"The recompense of an evil deed can only be an evil equal to it; but whoever pardons and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from God. Surely He does not love the wrongdoers"
  42,41,But whoever defends himself and restores his right (in the lawful way) after he has been wronged – against such there is no route (of blame and retaliation)
  42,42,"The route (of blame and retaliation) is only against those who wrong people and behave rebelliously on earth, offending against all right. For such there is a painful punishment"
  42,43,"But indeed whoever shows patience and forgives (the wrong done to him), surely that is a very meritorious thing, a matter of great resolution"
  42,44,"Whoever (due to his choice) God leads astray, he will no longer have any guardian (to help and support him). You will see the wrongdoers, when they see the punishment, saying: \"Is there any way back (to the world for us to become righteous people)"
