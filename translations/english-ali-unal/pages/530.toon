quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,28,And inform them that the water is to be shared between her and them; each sharer will be present by the water when it is their turn to drink
  54,29,"But (without observing the turn) they (schemed to slaughter the she-camel and) called their comrade (one of the nine ring-leaders); and so he ventured (upon the evil deed), and slaughtered her cruelly"
  54,30,And see how (severe) was My punishment and (how true) My warnings
  54,31,"We sent upon them a single Blast, and they became like dried chippings of shrubs used as cattle-fodder"
  54,32,"And indeed (by revealing it through human language) We have made the Qur’an easy for remembrance (of God and for taking heed). Then, is there any that remembers and takes heed"
  54,33,And the people of Lot also denied all the warnings (given to them)
  54,34,"We sent a hurricane of stones upon them, save the family of Lot: We saved them by early dawn"
  54,35,As a grace from Us. Thus do We reward those who give thanks
  54,36,"Lot had indeed forewarned them of Our striking down, but they disputed the warnings"
  54,37,"They had harassed him (with frequent coming-and-going) to abuse his guests, and so We blotted out their eyes: taste My punishment and (the consequences of) My warnings"
  54,38,The punishment decreed assuredly overtook them early in the morning
  54,39,So taste My punishment and (the consequences of) My warnings
  54,40,"And indeed (by revealing it through human language) We have made the Qur’an easy for remembrance (of God and for taking heed). Then, is there any that remembers and takes heed"
  54,41,And warnings certainly came also to the clan of the Pharaoh
  54,42,"Who denied all Our messages and signs (including the miracles showed to them), and in the end We seized them after the manner of One All-Glorious with irresistible might, All-Omnipotent"
  54,43,Now are your unbelievers (O Makkans) better and more powerful than those (whose exemplary histories We have recounted)? Or is there an exemption (from punishment written) for you in the Scriptures
  54,44,"Or do they say, \"We are a host united and invincible"
  54,45,"(But let them know that) the hosts will all be routed, and they will turn their backs and flee"
  54,46,"Indeed, the Last Hour is their appointed time (for their complete recompense), and the Last Hour will be more grievous and more bitter"
  54,47,The disbelieving criminals will be in utter loss away (from Paradise) and burning in the Blazes
  54,48,"On that Day they will be dragged in the Fire on their faces: \"Taste the touch of Hell"
  54,49,Surely We have created each and every thing by (precise) measure
