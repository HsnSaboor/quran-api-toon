quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,26,"And remember (with gratitude) when you were few and deemed weak in the land (and oppressed), fearing that people would snatch you away, how He provided you with refuge, and strengthened you with His help, and provided for you sustenance out of the pure, wholesome things, that you might give thanks (to Him from the heart and in speech, and in action by fulfilling His commandments)"
  8,27,"O you who believe! Do not betray God and His Messenger, that you should not betray the trusts in your keeping while you know (what doing so means)"
  8,28,"Know that your possessions and your children are but a trial and temptation, and God is He with Whom there is a tremendous reward"
  8,29,"O you who believe! If you keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety to deserve His protection, He will make a criterion for you (in your hearts to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and right and wrong), and blot out from you your evil deeds, and forgive you. God is of tremendous grace and bounty"
  8,30,"And (recall, O Messenger,) how those who disbelieve schemed against you to take you captive, or kill you, or drive you away (from Makkah). Thus were they scheming, but God put His will into effect (and brought their scheme to nothing). God wills what is the best (for His believing servants) and makes His will prevail"
  8,31,"When Our Revelations are recited to them, they say: \"We have heard (the like of this before many times); if we wish, we can speak the like of this; this is nothing but fables of the ancients"
  8,32,"And when they said (even this): \"O God! If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down upon us stones from the sky or bring upon us another painful punishment"
  8,33,But God would not punish them so long as you were among them; and God is not to punish them (or other people) while they implore Him for forgiveness for their sins
