quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,70,"They (still unwilling to carry out the order) replied: \"Pray for us to your Lord that He make clear to us what it should be like; cows are much alike to us; and if God wills, we will then be guided (to find the precise type of cow we are commanded to sacrifice, and sacrifice it)"
  2,71,"He (Moses) answered: \"He says, it is a cow unyoked to plough the earth or water the tillage, one kept secure and sound, with no blemish on it.\" \"Now you have brought the truth,\" they answered; and they sacrificed it, though they all but did not"
  2,72,"And (remember also) when you had killed a living soul, and were accusing one another to deny the responsibility, but God would disclose what you were concealing"
  2,73,"So We commanded: \"Strike him (the corpse) with part of it (the sacrificed cow).\" (So they did and the corpse, brought to life, informed of the murderer.) Even so God brings to life the dead, and shows you the signs (of His Power, Oneness and way of acting), that you may understand the truth, (and have no doubt at all, concerning the essentials of faith)"
  2,74,"Then, a while after that, your hearts became hardened; they were like rocks, or even harder, for there are rocks from which rivers come gushing; there are some that split and water issues from them; and there are still others that roll down for fear and awe of God. (Whereas your hearts are harder than rocks, and) God is not unaware and unmindful of what you do"
  2,75,"(O community of the believers!) Do you hope that those people (whose hearts have become more hardened than rocks and who have continually shown disloyalty to God,) will believe you (and believe in the Prophet Muhammad, and in the Book he brought and the Religion he preaches)? (It is surely not possible) when there has been a party among them that hear the Word of God, and then, after they reasoned and judged it (to be the Word of God), have tampered with it knowingly"
  2,76,"When they meet those who believe, they declare (hypocritically), \"We believe (in what you believe in);\" but when they are alone with one another in private, they say (chiding each other): \"Will you tell them what God has disclosed to you, that they might use it as an argument against you before your Lord? Do you have no sense"
