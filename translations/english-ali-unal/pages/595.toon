quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and its brightness
  91,2,And the moon as it follows it (reflecting its light)
  91,3,And the day as it reveals it (the sun)
  91,4,And the night as it enshrouds it
  91,5,And the heaven and that (All-Magnificent One) Who has built it
  91,6,And the earth and that (All-Magnificent One) Who has spread it
  91,7,"And the human selfhood and that (All-Knowing, All-Powerful, and All-Wise One) Who has formed it to perfection"
  91,8,And Who has inspired it with the conscience of what is wrong and bad for it and what is right and good for it
  91,9,He is indeed prosperous who has grown it in purity (away from self-aggrandizing rebellion against God)
  91,10,And he is indeed lost who has corrupted it (in self-aggrandizing rebellion against God)
  91,11,"The (tribe of) Thamud denied (the Divine Message and their Messenger, and displayed their denial) in their arrogant rebellion"
  91,12,(Especially) when (finally) the most wicked among them (instigated by his people) rushed forward
  91,13,"The Messenger of God (Salih) said (warning them, and reminding them again of the terms of their pledge): \"It is the she-camel of God, and observe her turn in drinking"
  91,14,"But they denied him and slaughtered her, and so their Lord crushed them for their sin, and leveled them (with the ground)"
  91,15,And He (being the All-Knowing and All-Powerful and All-Just) does not fear the outcome (of events)
  92,1,By the night as it enshrouds (the earth in its darkness)
  92,2,And the day as it rises bright
  92,3,And that (All-Magnificent One) Who has created the male and the female
  92,4,Surely your endeavor is diverse (in character and ends)
  92,5,"Then, as for him who gives (out of his wealth for God’s good pleasure), and keeps from disobedience to Him in reverence for Him and piety"
  92,6,"And affirms the best (in creed, action, and the reward to be given)"
  92,7,We will make easy for him the path to the state of ease (salvation after an easy reckoning)
  92,8,But as for him who is niggardly and regards himself as self-sufficient in independence of Him
  92,9,"And denies the best (in creed, action, and the reward to be given)"
  92,10,We will make easy for him the path to hardship (punishment after a hard reckoning)
  92,11,And his wealth will not avail him when he falls to ruin
  92,12,It is surely for Us to bestow guidance
  92,13,And to Us belong the Hereafter as well as the former (life)
  92,14,And so I warn you of a Fire blazing fiercely
