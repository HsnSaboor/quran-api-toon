quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  44,19,And do not exalt yourself in proud defiance against God (by disobeying His order and so rejecting my Messengership). Surely I have come to you with an evident authority
  44,20,"I have sought refuge in my Lord, Who is surely also your Lord, from your stoning me to death"
  44,21,"If you will not believe in me, then keep away from me (let me go)"
  44,22,"Then he called upon his Lord: \"These are indeed a guilty people committed to accumulating sin"
  44,23,"Then (his Lord commanded him): \"Set forth with My servants by night. You are sure to be pursued"
  44,24,"And now leave the sea in quiet (as it was when it divided for you), for they are a host destined to be drowned"
  44,25,How many were the gardens and springs that they left behind
  44,26,"And cornfields, and excellent dwellings, and elevated, honored situations"
  44,27,"And other comforts of life, in which they used to take delight"
  44,28,Just so! And We made another people heirs (to the bounties they enjoyed)
  44,29,"And neither the heaven nor the earth shed tears over them, nor were they given a respite (when the punishment became due on them)"

  44,33,"And (as a favor) We granted them many signs (miracles), in which there was a manifest trial"
  44,34,Yet these (Makkan polytheist) people say with emphasis
  44,35,"There is nothing beyond our first death, and we will not be raised again"

  44,37,"What? Are they better (in wealth and power), or were the people of Tubba‘ and the others (that We destroyed) before them? We destroyed them, for they were disbelieving criminals committed to accumulating sins"
  44,38,We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in play and fun
  44,39,"We have created them only with truth (for meaningful purposes, and on solid foundations of truth), but most people do not know"
