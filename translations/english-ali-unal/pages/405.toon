quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,6,"(This is) God’s promise. God never fails His promise, but most people do not know this (as they have no true knowledge about God)"
  30,7,"They only know (what reaches to their senses from) the outward aspect of the life of this world, but they are heedless and unaware of (what lies beyond it and) the Hereafter"
  30,8,"Do they not reflect upon themselves (even once)? God has not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them save with truth (meaningfully and for definite, wise purposes, and on solid foundations of truth), and for an appointed term. But surely many among the people are in unbelief about the meeting with their Lord"
  30,9,"Have they never traveled about the earth and seen what was the outcome for those before them (who also obstinately disbelieved in Our signs)? They were greater than them in power. They cultivated the soil and mined it (for minerals and water resources), and built it up more and better than these have done. And in time their Messengers came to them with clear proofs of the truth (which they rejected to their own doom). God would never wrong them, but it was they themselves who were wronging themselves"
  30,10,"In consequence, the outcome for those who were lost in evil was evil, as they denied God’s Revelations and signs, and were mocking them"
  30,11,"God originates creation in the first instance, and then reproduces it, (and will bring it back in the Hereafter), and then you will be returned to Him"
  30,12,"When the Last Hour stands forth and the Judgment is established, the disbelieving criminals will be plunged into despair"
  30,13,"They will have no intercessors in the beings whom they associate (as partners with God), and they will no longer believe in their being partners with God"
  30,14,When the Last Hour stands forth (and the Judgment is established) – on that Day all people will be separated from one another
  30,15,"As for those who believe and do good, righteous deeds, they will be honored and made happy in a delightful Garden"
