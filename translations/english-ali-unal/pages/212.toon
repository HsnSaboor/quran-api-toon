quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,26,"For those who do good, aware that God is seeing them is the best (of the rewards that God has promised for good deeds), and still more. Neither stain nor ignominy will cover their faces. They are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein"
  10,27,"And for those who have earned evil deeds, the recompense of an evil deed will be the like of it; and ignominy will cover them – nor will they have anyone to defend them against God – it is as though their faces were veiled with patches of darkest night. Those are the companions of the Fire, they will abide therein"
  10,28,"On that Day We will raise them all to life and gather them all together, and then We will order those who associated partners with God: \"Get to your place, you and your (so-called) associates (of God)!\" So did We distinguish between them and the believers, and separate them from their associates. Their associates say to them: \"It was not us that you worshipped"
  10,29,"God is sufficient as a witness between us and you: we were certainly unaware of your worshipping (us)"
  10,30,"There every soul will experience what it did before (in the world). They have been returned to God, their true Owner and Master; and those that they fabricated to worship besides God have failed them"
  10,31,"Say: \"Who is it that provides for you from heaven and earth, or Who is it that possesses full power over (your) hearing and eyes, or Who is it that brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living, and Who directs the whole affair (the universe)?\" They will say, \"It is God.\" Then, say: \"Will you not then keep your duty to him in reverence for Him and in fear of His punishment"
  10,32,"That is God (Who does all these), Your rightful Lord, the Absolute Truth and Ever-Constant. What is there, after the truth, but error? Then, how are you turned about (to different ways, removed from the Straight Path)"
  10,33,"Thus has the word of your Lord proved true with regard to those who transgress: that they will not believe"
