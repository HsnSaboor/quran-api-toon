quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the heaven and that which comes at night
  86,2,What enables you to perceive what it is that comes at night
  86,3,It is the bright piercing star
  86,4,There is not a soul but over it is a guardian
  86,5,"Let human, then, consider from what he has been created"
  86,6,He has been created from some of a lowly fluid gushing forth
  86,7,It proceeds (as a result of incitement) between the (lumbar zone in the) vertebra and the ribs
  86,8,Surely He (Who has created human from a lowly fluid) is able to restore him (to life after his death)
  86,9,On the Day when all things (that remained or were kept) secret will be made manifest
  86,10,"And he will have no power, nor a helper (against God’s punishment)"
  86,11,I swear by the heaven ever-revolving (with whatever is in it and recurring patterns of rainfall)
  86,12,"And by the earth, bursting (with the growth of plants)"
  86,13,Surely it (the Qur’an) is a decisive Word distinguishing (between truth and falsehood)
  86,14,It is not (a word) in jest
  86,15,They (who reject it) are busy making schemes
  86,16,"And I am \"making a scheme"
  86,17,So let the unbelievers remain at will; let them continue to remain at will for a little while
  87,1,"Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High"
  87,2,Who creates and fashions in due proportions
  87,3,"And Who determines (a particular life, nature, and goal for each creature), and guides (it toward the fulfillment of that goal)"
  87,4,And Who brings forth herbage
  87,5,"Then turns it to dark-colored, rotten stubble"
  87,6,"(For the guidance of humankind,) We will establish the Qur’an in your heart and have you recite (it to others), so you will not forget (anything of it)"
  87,7,Except what God wills. Surely He knows all that is manifest and all that is hidden (including your outward and inward states)
  87,8,We will guide you to the easiest path (in all your affairs)
  87,9,"So remind and instruct (them in the truth), in case reminder and instruction may be of use"
  87,10,He who stands in awe of God will be mindful of the instruction
  87,11,But the most wicked one remains aloof from it
  87,12,He who will enter the Great Fire (of Hell) to roast
  87,13,He will neither die therein (to be saved from punishment) nor live
  87,14,"Prosperous indeed is he who purifies himself (of sins, and of his wealth by spending from it in God’s cause and for the needy)"
  87,15,And who mentions the Name of his Lord and does the Prayer
