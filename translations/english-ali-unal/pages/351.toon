quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,11,"Surely those who invented and spread the slander (against ‘A’ishah, the Messenger’s wife) are a band from among you. However, do not deem this incident an evil for you; rather, it is good for you. (As for the slanderers:) every one of them has accumulated sin in proportion to his share in this guilt, and he who has the greater part of it will suffer a tremendous punishment"
  24,12,"When you heard of it, why did the believing men and women not think well of one another and declare: \"This is obviously a slander"
  24,13,"Why did they not produce four witnesses (in support of the accusation)? Now that they have not produced witnesses, it is indeed they who are the liars in God’s sight"
  24,14,"Were it not for God’s grace to and favor upon you, and His mercy in the world and the Hereafter, a mighty punishment would certainly have afflicted you (who got involved in circulating rumors) on account of what you indulged in"
  24,15,Just think how you welcomed it with your tongues from one another and uttered with your mouths something about which you had no knowledge. You deemed it a trifle whereas in God’s sight it was most grave
  24,16,"Why did you not say, when you heard of it, \"It is not for us to speak of this. All-Glorified are You (O God)! This is an awesome slander"
  24,17,"God admonishes you lest you ever repeat anything like this, if you are (truly)] believers"
  24,18,"He clearly expounds to you His instructions and the signposts of His way. God is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  24,19,"Those who love that indecency should spread among those who believe, surely for them is a painful punishment in the world and the Hereafter. God knows (the exact truth and nature of all matters), but you do not know"
  24,20,"Were it not for God’s grace and favor to upon you, and His mercy, and that God is All-Pitying, All-Compassionate (especially towards His believing servants, what terrible consequences would such evils have caused in your community)"
