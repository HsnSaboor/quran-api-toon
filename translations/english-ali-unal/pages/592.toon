quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,But you (O humankind) are disposed to prefer the life of this world
  87,17,While the Hereafter is better and more lasting
  87,18,This is surely contained in the former Scrolls
  87,19,The Scrolls of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Has the account of the Overwhelming come to you
  88,2,Some faces will on that Day be downcast
  88,3,Having toiled (in the world) only to weariness (with no portion in the Hereafter)
  88,4,"They will enter the hot, burning Fire to roast"
  88,5,They will be given to drink from a boiling spring
  88,6,No food will there be for them but a poisonous thorny plant
  88,7,It will neither nourish nor avail against hunger
  88,8,And some faces on that Day will be in delight
  88,9,Well-pleased with (the fruit of) their endeavor (in the world)
  88,10,In a lofty Garden
  88,11,Wherein they will hear no idle talk
  88,12,Therein will be a flowing spring
  88,13,Therein couches raised high
  88,14,And goblets placed ready
  88,15,And cushions arrayed
  88,16,And rich carpets spread out
  88,17,"Do they not consider the camels, how they are created"
  88,18,"And the heaven, how it has been raised high"
  88,19,"And the mountains, how they have been set firm"
  88,20,"And the earth, how it has been spread out"
  88,21,"And so remind and exhort (them), for you are one (whose duty is) to remind and exhort"
  88,22,You are not one to dictate (faith) to them
  88,23,"But whoever turns away (averse to reminder and exhortation), and disbelieves (in what is conveyed to him)"
  88,24,God will punish him with the greatest punishment (of Hell)
  88,25,Indeed to Us is their return
  88,26,Thereafter it is for Us to call them to account
