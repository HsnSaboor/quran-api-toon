quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Say: \"What is most weighty in testimony?\" Say: \"God: a witness between me and you; and to me is being revealed this Qur’an so that I may warn you thereby, and whomever it may reach.\" (O you who associate partners with God:) Do you truly testify that there are deities besides God? Say (to them): \"I give no such testimony.\" Say: \"He is only One God, and surely I am absolutely free from your association of partners with Him and from whatever you associate with Him as partners"
  6,20,"Those who were given the Book (before) know him (the Messenger with all his distinguishing attributes) as they know their own sons; yet those who ruin their own selves (by concealing this truth, being overcome by their lusts and worldly interests) – they do not believe"
  6,21,"Who is more in wrong than he who fabricates falsehood in attribution to God and denies His signs (in the universe and their own selves pointing to Him) and His Revelations. Assuredly, the wrongdoers will not prosper"
  6,22,"A Day will come when We raise them all from the dead and gather them together, and then ask those who (while they were in the world) associated partners with God: \"Where, now, are those of yours whom you asserted to have a part in Divinity"
  6,23,"Then they will have no argument except to say: \"By God, our Lord, we were not of those who associated partners with God"
  6,24,"Look! – How they lie against themselves, and (how) what they fabricated as partners (to worship besides God) has failed them"
  6,25,"There are among them such as could not help but listen to you (reciting the Qur’an), but We have laid veils over their hearts (made by their ill-intention, wrongdoing, and arrogance, which caused them to lose the capacity to believe) so that they do not comprehend it (and so cannot believe), and in their ears, heaviness: even if they see whatever manifest sign (pointing to God’s Unity and other truths of faith), they will not believe in it – so much so that when they come to you (only in order) to dispute with you, they, who have disbelieved, say: \"This is nothing but fables of the ancients"
  6,26,"They bar others from it (the Qur’an), as they themselves keep afar from it; and in doing so, they destroy only their own selves, though they do not perceive it"
  6,27,"If you (O Messenger) could see them when they are made to stand by the Fire, and (in dread of being thrown into it, as if they forgot that they denied their associating partners with God) they say: \"Oh, would that we were brought back (to the world)! Then we would not deny the signs and Revelations of our Lord and would be among the believers"
