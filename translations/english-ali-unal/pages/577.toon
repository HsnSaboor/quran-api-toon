quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,"And so, of no benefit to them will be the intercession of any who are entitled to intercede, (even if they are allowed to intercede)"
  74,49,"What, then, is the matter with them that they turn away in aversion from the Reminder (the Qur’an)"
  74,50,As though they were frightened wild donkeys
  74,51,Fleeing from a lion
  74,52,"Indeed, every one of them desires that he should be given a Book (particular to him) opened out"
  74,53,"By no means! Indeed, they do not (believe in and, therefore, do not) fear the Hereafter"
  74,54,By no means! This (Qur’an) is a reminder and admonition (sufficient for all)
  74,55,"So, whoever wills receives admonition and takes heed"
  74,56,"Yet they will not receive admonition and take heed unless God wills; He is the Lord of righteousness and piety, and the Lord of forgiveness"
  75,1,I swear by the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,And I swear by the self-accusing human soul
  75,3,Does human think that We will never assemble his bones (to resurrect him)
  75,4,"Yes indeed, We are able to make whole his very fingertips"
  75,5,"But human (by willful choice) denies what lies ahead of him (the other life, because he desires to live only as he pleases)"
  75,6,"He asks: \"When is the Day of Resurrection"
  75,7,When the eyesight is confounded (through fear)
  75,8,And the moon is darkened
  75,9,And the sun and the moon are joined together
  75,10,"On that Day human will say: \"Where is the escape"
  75,11,By no means! No refuge (to flee to)
  75,12,To your Lord the journey’s end will be on that Day
  75,13,"Human will be made understand on that Day all (the good and evil) that he has forwarded (to his afterlife while in the world), and all (the good and evil) that he has left behind"
  75,14,"Indeed, human will be an eye-witness (providing evidence) against himself"
  75,15,Even though he puts forth his excuses
  75,16,(O Prophet!) Move not your tongue to hasten it (for safekeeping in your heart)
  75,17,Surely it is for Us to collect it (in your heart) and enable you to recite it (by heart)
  75,18,"So when We recite it, follow its recitation"
  75,19,"Thereafter, it is for Us to explain it"
