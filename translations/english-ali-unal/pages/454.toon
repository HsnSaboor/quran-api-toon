quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,17,"Bear patiently all that they say, and remember Our servant David, powerful (in his glorification of God, in knowledge, in kingdom, and in fighting). Surely he was one ever turning to God in penitence"
  38,18,We subdued the mountains to glorify (their Lord) along with him in the afternoon and bright morning
  38,19,And the birds assembled; all were turned to Him (in devotion and glorification)
  38,20,"We strengthened his kingdom, and granted him wisdom and decisive speech (to inform, and convince, and lead)"
  38,21,"Now, has the report of the litigants come to you, when they climbed over the wall into the royal chamber"
  38,22,"When they entered in upon David, and so he was taken aback by them. They said: \"Do not be alarmed! (We are) two litigating parties; one party trespassed against the right of the other. So judge between us with truth; do not be unjust; and guide us to the level path"
  38,23,"(One of them explained the case): \"This is my brother: He has ninety-nine ewes, and I have but one. Then he said, ‘Make it over to me,’ and he overpowered me in (force of) speech"
  38,24,"David said: \"He has undoubtedly wronged you in demanding your single ewe to add to his own ewes. Truly many are the partners in business who trespass against the right of one another, except such as believe and do good, righteous deeds, and how few they are!\" David came to understand that We had tried him, so he appealed to his Lord for forgiveness, and fell down in prostration, and turned to God in contrition"
  38,25,So We forgave him that. Indeed he enjoyed nearness to Us and an excellent place of final return
  38,26,"O David! We have appointed you a vicegerent in the land (to rule according to Our commandments); so judge among people with the truth and do not follow personal inclination, lest it leads you astray from the path of God. Surely, those who wander astray from God’s path – for them there is a severe punishment because they have forgotten the Day of Reckoning"
