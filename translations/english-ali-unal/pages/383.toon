quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  27,64,"Or He Who originates creation in the first instance and then reproduces it, and Who provides you from the heaven and the earth? Is there another deity besides God? Say: \"Produce your evidence, if you are truthful"
  27,65,"Say: \"None in the heavens and on the earth knows the Unseen (all that lies in the hidden realms and beyond any created being’s perception), but only God knows it. Neither do they (or their false deities) know when (the world will be destroyed and) they will be raised to life (after their death)"
  27,66,"No, indeed. Their knowledge does not attain to the Hereafter (as they have desired only the worldly life and wasted their faculties of learning in pursuit of worldly knowledge). No, indeed, for (despite being informed about it through Revelation) they remain in doubt about it. No, indeed, for they remain blind to (all the arguments about) it"
  27,67,"Those who obstinately persist in unbelief say: \"What! is it when we have already become dust – is it then that we and our forefathers will be brought forth (to a new life)"
  27,68,"We have certainly been threatened with this before, we and our forefathers. This is nothing but fables of the ancients"
  27,69,"Say: \"Go about the earth and see how was the outcome for the disbelieving criminals"
  27,70,"Do not grieve over them (because of their negative response toward your mission), nor be distressed because of all that they scheme (to void your mission and bar people from God’s way)"
  27,71,"They also say: \"(So tell us) when is this threat to be fulfilled, if you are truthful"
  27,72,"Say: \"It may well be that something of that which you ask to be hastened has already drawn quite near behind you"
  27,73,Indeed your Lord is most Bountiful to humankind but most of them do not give thanks
  27,74,Your Lord certainly knows whatever their bosoms conceal and whatever they disclose
  27,75,There is nothing hidden (from them as from all creatures) in the heaven or on the earth but is in a Manifest Book
  27,76,Surely this Qur’an explains to the Children of Israel most of the matters on which they differ
