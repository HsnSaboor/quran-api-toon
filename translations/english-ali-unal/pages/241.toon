  12,46,"(Coming to Joseph in the prison, he said): \"Joseph, O man of truth! Enlighten us about seven fat cows being devoured by seven lean ones, and seven green ears of grain and another (seven) dry – so that I can return to the people (of the court).

  12,47,"He said: \"You shall sow for seven years as usual, but that which you have harvested, leave it in the ear, all save a little which you eat"
