quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  10,79,"And the Pharaoh said: \"Bring me every learned, skillful sorcerer"
  10,80,"When the sorcerers came, Moses said to them: \"Throw down what you will throw"
  10,81,"When they had thrown (whatever they had in their hands and produced a mighty sorcery), Moses said: \"What you have brought is but sorcery. Surely God will bring it to nothing and prove it false. God never validates and sets right the work of those who cause disorder and corruption"
  10,82,"And God proves by His decrees the truth to be true and makes it triumph, however hateful this is to the criminals"
  10,83,None save a young generation among his people believed in Moses for (they were in) fear that the Pharaoh and the chiefs among them (who collaborated with the Pharaoh in order not to lose their wealth) would subject them to persecutions. The Pharaoh was indeed a haughty tyrant in the land and he was indeed one of those who commit excesses
  10,84,"And Moses said (in earnest advice to his people): \"If you believe in God, then put your trust in Him, if you are Muslims (who have wholly submitted themselves to Him)"
  10,85,"They invoked (verbally and by their actions): \"In God we put our trust. Our Lord! Do not make us a target of persecution for the wrongdoing people"
  10,86,And save us through Your mercy from those unbelieving people
  10,87,"We revealed to Moses and his brother: \"Appoint houses for your people in Egypt (as places of refuge and coming together in God’s cause), and (as a whole community) make your homes places to turn to God, and establish the Prescribed Prayer in conformity with its conditions. And (O Moses,) give glad tidings to the believers"
  10,88,"Moses prayed to God: \"Our Lord! Surely You have granted the Pharaoh and his chiefs splendor and riches in the life of this world, and so, our Lord, they lead people astray from Your way. Our Lord! Destroy their riches, and press upon their hearts, for they do not believe until they see the painful punishment"
