  2,127,"And when Abraham, and Ishmael with him, raised the foundations of the House (they were praying): \"Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Surely You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing"
  2,128,"Our Lord! Make us Muslims, submissive to You, and of our offspring a community Muslim, submissive to You. Show us our rites of worship (including particularly the rites of the Pilgrimage) and accept our repentance (for our inability to worship You as worshipping You requires). Surely You are the One Who accepts repentance and returns it with liberal forgiveness and additional reward, the All-Compassionate"
  2,129,"Our Lord! Raise up among that community a Messenger of their own, reciting to them Your Revelations, and instructing them in the Book (that You will reveal to him) and the Wisdom, and purifying them (of false beliefs and doctrines, of sins and all kinds of uncleanness). Surely You are the All-Glorious with irresistible might, the All-Wise"

Therefore, make sure that you do not die except as Muslims (those submitted to Him exclusively)"
  2,133,"Or were you (O Children of Israel, of Jacob) witnesses when death came to Jacob (so that you might claim that he bequeathed and enjoined a religion otherwise than as Abraham did, to give yourselves an excuse for refusing Islam,) when he said to his sons: \"What will you worship after me?\" They answered: \"We will worship your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac, One God; we are Muslims submitted to Him"
  2,134,"Those were a people that passed away. Theirs is what they earned, and yours is what you earn. You will not be called to account for what they used to do"
