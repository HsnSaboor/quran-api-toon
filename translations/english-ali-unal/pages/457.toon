quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  38,62,"And (the rebellious ones) say: \"What is it with us that we cannot see the men (the poor and weak believers) whom we used to count among the wicked"
  38,63,"Whom we used to take in mockery? Or is it that (they are here with us, but) our eyes have missed them (just as we turned our eyes from them in contempt in the world)"
  38,64,Such will in truth be the mutual wrangling of the people of the Fire
  38,65,"Say: \"I am but a warner. There is no deity save God, the One (with no-one and nothing like or comparable to Him), the All-Overwhelming (with absolute sway over all that exists)"
  38,66,"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, the All-Glorious with irresistible might, the All-Forgiving"
  38,67,"Say: \"This (Qur’an) is a supreme message"
  38,68,You turn away from it in aversion
  38,69,I had no knowledge of the High Assembly (in the heavens) when they were arguing
  38,70,I (follow only what is revealed to me and) it is revealed to me that I am but a plain warner
  38,71,"(Remember) when your Lord said to the angels: \"I am creating a mortal out of clay (to set him on the earth as vicegerent)"
  38,72,"When I have fashioned him fully and breathed into Him out of My Spirit, then fall down prostrating before him (as a sign of respect for him and his superiority)"
  38,73,"So the angels prostrated, all of them together"
  38,74,But Iblis did not (in defiance of God’s explicit order to him); he grew arrogant and displayed himself as an unbeliever
  38,75,"(God) said: \"O Iblis! What prevents you from prostrating before the being whom I have created with My two Hands? Are you too proud (to bow down before any created being in defiance of My command), or are you (of those who think themselves) so high in honor (that they cannot be ordered to prostrate before anyone)"
  38,76,"(Iblis) answered: \"I am better than him. You have created me from fire and him You have created from clay"
  38,77,"(God) said: \"Then get you down out of it; surely You are one eternally rejected (from My Mercy)"
  38,78,And My curse is on you until the Day of Judgment
  38,79,"He said: \"My Lord, grant me respite till the Day when they are raised (from the dead)"
  38,80,"(God) said: \"You are of the ones granted respite"
  38,81,Until the Day of the Time Appointed
  38,82,"(Iblis) said: \"Then (I swear) by Your Glory, I will certainly cause them all to rebel and go astray"
  38,83,"Except Your servants among them, endowed with sincerity in faith and worshipping You"
