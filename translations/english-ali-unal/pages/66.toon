  3,123,"For sure God had helped you to victory at Badr when you were a despised (small) force. So observe your duty to God in due reverence for Him, that you may be thankful"
  3,124,"When you said to the believers: \"Does it not suffice you that your Lord will come to your help with three thousand angels sent down"
  3,125,"Surely it does. (More than that), if you are steadfast and act in piety to deserve His protection, and the enemy should fall upon you all at once, your Lord will come to your help with five thousand angels swooping down"
  3,126,"God did not ordain this save as a message of good hope for you, and so that thereby your hearts might be at peace – victory comes only from God, the All-Glorious with irresistible might, the All-Wise"

  3,128,"(O Messenger, you are a servant charged with a certain duty, therefore) it is not a matter for you whether He turns towards them in mercy (to accept their repentance for their unbelief, and grants them faith) or punishes them because they are wrongdoers"
  3,129,"To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth; He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And God is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate"
  3,130,"O you who believe! Do not consume usury, doubled and redoubled; and act in piety, keeping from disobedience to Him, so that you may prosper (in both worlds)"
