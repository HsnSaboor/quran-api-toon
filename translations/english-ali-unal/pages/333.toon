quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  22,6,"And so, God is He Who is the Absolute Truth and Ever-Constant, and He gives life to the dead, and He has full power over everything"
  22,7,And the Last Hour is sure to come – there is no doubt about it. And God will surely raise up all who are in the graves
  22,8,"And yet, among people there are some who dispute about God without having any true knowledge or any true guidance or an enlightening (Divine) Book"
  22,9,"They keep on disputing arrogantly to lead people astray from God’s way. For such there is disgrace in the world, and on the Day of Resurrection We will cause them to taste the punishment of the scorching Fire"
  22,10,"This punishment is the outcome of what you have (committed and) forwarded with your own hands, and never does God do the least wrong to His servants"

This indeed is the obvious loss"

  22,14,"Surely God will admit those who believe and do good, righteous deeds into the Gardens through which rivers flow. Surely God does whatever He wills"
  22,15,"Whoever thinks that God will not help the Messenger to victory in the world and to utmost prosperity in the Hereafter, then let him move heaven and earth to prevent His help: let him stretch out a rope to heaven (to prevent God’s help and Revelation from reaching him), and then sever that rope to descend without being broken into pieces. Then let him see whether the schemes he makes will be of any avail to him, and (whether he can) do away with what enrages him"
