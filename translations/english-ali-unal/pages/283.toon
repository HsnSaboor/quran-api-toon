quran[10]{c,v,t}:

  17,12,"(As in the life of humankind, \"days\" and \"nights\" alternate in the world also.) We have made the night and the day two signs (manifesting the truth of God’s Power, Knowledge, and absolute sovereignty, and His grace on you). We have obscured the sign of the night (made it dark) and We have made the sign of the day illuminating (therefore a means for you) to see, that you may seek bounty from your Lord and that you may know the computation of (time) the years and the reckoning; We set out all things in clear detail"

  17,15,"Whoever takes the right way takes it for the good of his soul only; and whoever goes astray, goes astray but to its harm only.

We would never punish (a person or community for the wrong they have done) until We have sent a Messenger (to give counsel and warning)"
  17,16,"And when We finally will to destroy a township (that has deserved destruction), We leave those of its people lost in the pursuit of pleasures to their own devices, and so they transgress all limits therein. In consequence, the word (of punishment) is justified against it, and so We annihilate it, reducing it to nothing"
  17,17,How many a generation have We (thus) destroyed after Noah! Your Lord suffices as one All-Aware and All-Seeing of the sins of His servants
