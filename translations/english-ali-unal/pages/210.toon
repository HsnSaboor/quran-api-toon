quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,15,"When Our Revelations, clear as evidence and in meaning are recited (and conveyed) to them, those who have no expectations to meet Us say (in response to Our Messenger): \"Either bring a Qur’an other than this or alter it.\" Say: \"It is not for me to alter it of my own accord. I only follow what is revealed to me. Indeed I fear, if I should rebel against my Lord, the punishment of an Awful Day"
  10,16,"Say (also): \"If God had so willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have brought it to your knowledge. I lived among you a whole lifetime before it (began to be revealed to me). Will you not reason and understand"
  10,17,Who is more in the wrong than he who fabricates falsehood in attribution to God or denies His Revelations and His signs (in the universe and in their own selves). Surely the disbelieving criminals will not prosper
  10,18,"They worship, apart from God, things or beings that can neither harm nor benefit them, and they say: \"These are our intercessors with God.\" Say: \"Would you inform God of something in the heavens or the earth that He does not know? All-Glorified is He, and absolutely exalted above all that they associate with Him"
  10,19,"Humankind (in the beginning) were but one community following one single way but later they differed and began following different ways. Had it not been for a decree already issued by your Lord (postponing the final, decisive judgment until an appointed term), it would indeed have been judged between them in respect of all that they differ on"
  10,20,"They say: \"Why isn’t a miraculous sign (of a different sort) sent down on him from his Lord?\" Say, then: \"The Unseen belongs to God alone (He does whatever He wills and only He knows what the future will bring): therefore, wait and see, indeed I too am with you among those who wait"
