quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,Most certainly it is a Qur’an (recited) most honorable
  56,78,In a Book well-guarded
  56,79,None except the purified ones can reach it (to obtain the knowledge it contains. And none except those cleansed of material and spiritual impurities should touch it)
  56,80,It is a Book being sent down in parts from the Lord of the worlds
  56,81,Is it this Discourse that you hold in low esteem
  56,82,And do you make your share of it denying it
  56,83,"Then, how is it you do not – when the soul comes up to the throat (of a dying human)"
  56,84,While you are looking on –
  56,85,"And while We are nearer to him (the dying human) than you are, but you do not see (that) –"
  56,86,"Then, how is it you do not – if you are not bound to Us in dependence (subject to Our will) –"
  56,87,"(How is it that) you do not restore the soul (of that dying human), if you are truthful (in your claim)"
  56,88,"Now, if he (that dying human) is of those near-stationed to God"
  56,89,"Then (there is for him) comfort in eternal relief (from all kinds of hardships and pains), and abundance, and a Garden of bounty and blessing"
  56,90,If he is of the people of the Right (the people of happiness and prosperity who will receive their Records in their right hands)
  56,91,"Then \"Peace be upon you\" (will be what you will always hear) from the people of the Right"
  56,92,"But if he is one of those who denied (Our Message and Our Messengers), who strayed (from the Straight Path)"
  56,93,Then his entertainment is boiling water
  56,94,And roasting in a Blazing Flame
  56,95,Surely this (Qur’an) is certain truth
  56,96,"So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Supreme (affirming that He is exalted above any falsehood)"
  57,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glorifies God; and He is the All-Glorious with irresistible might, the All-Wise"
  57,2,To Him belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes to die. He has full power over everything
  57,3,"He is the First, the Last, the All-Outward, and the All-Inward. He has full knowledge of everything"
