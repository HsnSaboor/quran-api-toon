quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,49,"Say: \"The truth has come (and manifested itself); and falsehood cannot originate (anything even if its followers try to keep it going), nor can it restore anything (of that which it has lost)"
  34,50,"Say: \"Were I to go astray, it would be to my own harm (and due to my own self). And if I am rightly guided, it is by virtue of what my Lord is revealing to me. Surely He is All-Hearing, All-Near"
  34,51,"If you could but see when they quake with dread (of death), with no escape, and are seized from a position very near"
  34,52,"They say: \"We have believed in it (the Qur’an)!\" But how can they hope to attain to faith and salvation from a position so far away"
  34,53,(Seeing that) they certainly disbelieved in it before. They have been aiming at the Unseen (the Hereafter) from far away (with words all untrue and without any basis in true knowledge)
  34,54,"And a barrier has been placed between them and what they had appetite for (while in the world), as was done with the likes of them before. Surely they were (lost) in hopeless doubt"
  35,1,"All praise and thanks are for God, the Originator of the heavens and the earth (each with particular features and ordered principles), Who appoints the angels as messengers (conveying His commands) having wings, two, or three, or four (or more). He increases in creation what He wills. Surely God has full power over everything"
  35,2,"Whatever God opens up for human beings out of (the treasures of) His Mercy, none is able to withhold; and whatever He withholds, none is able to release. He is the All-Glorious with irresistible might (Whom none can prevent Him from doing what He wills), the All-Wise (in Whose every act there are many instances of wisdom)"
  35,3,"O humankind! Remember and reflect on God’s favors upon you. Is there any Creator, other than God, that provides for you from the heaven and the earth? There is no deity but He: How then are you turned away from the truth and make false claims"
