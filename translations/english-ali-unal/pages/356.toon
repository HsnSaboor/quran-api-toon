quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,44,God turns about the night and the day. Surely in that is a lesson for those who have the power of seeing
  24,45,"God has created every living creature from water. Among them are such as move on their bellies, and such as move on two legs, and such as move on four. God creates whatever He wills. Surely, God has full power over everything"
  24,46,Assuredly We have sent down Revelations which show the truth clearly and illuminate your way. God guides whom He wills to a straight path
  24,47,"They say, \"We have believed in God and in the Messenger, and We have promised obedience (to both),\" but then, after that a party among them turn away (contradicting their declaration by their attitudes and actions). Such are not believers"
  24,48,"When they are called to God and His Messenger so that the Messenger may judge between them, see how a party among them turn away in aversion"
  24,49,"If the right be on their side, they come willingly in acceptance of it"
  24,50,"Is there a sickness in their hearts (that corrupts their will and character)? Or have they fallen prey to doubts? Or do they fear that God and His Messenger will deal unjustly with them? No, the truth is that they themselves are wrongdoers"
  24,51,"The only utterance of the (true) believers, when they are called to God and His Messenger so that the Messenger may judge between them, is: \"We have heard and we obey.\" Such are those who are the prosperous"
  24,52,"Whoever obeys God and His Messenger, and is overwhelmed by awe of God and keeps from disobedience to Him in reverence for Him and piety, such indeed are those who are the triumphant"
  24,53,"They (the hypocritical ones) swear by God most solemnly that if you should ever order them, they would most certainly go forth (to fight in God’s cause). Tell them: \"Do not swear. What is expected of you is obedience of the proper kind, well-known. (So you should do what other believers do and therefore will go forth when commanded to do so without gestures indicating exaggeration and affectation).\" God is fully aware of all that you do"
