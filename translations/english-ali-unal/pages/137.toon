quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,74,"And (call to mind) when Abraham spoke to his father Azar: \"Do you take idols for deities? Indeed, I see you and your people lost in obvious error"
  6,75,"Thus (he spoke and acted for) We had showed Abraham (the ugliness and irrationality of polytheism and) the inner dimension of (the existence of) the heavens and the earth, and the eternal truth (which this outer, corporeal dimension manifests and depends upon} – this We had done so that he might be one of those who have achieved certainty of faith (that he might attain the final degree in his certainty as a Messenger of God)"
  6,76,"When the night overspread over him, he saw a star; and he exclaimed: \"This is my Lord, (is it)?\" But when it set (sank from sight), he said: \"I love not the things that set"
  6,77,"And when (on another night), he beheld the full moon rising in splendor, he said: \"This is my Lord, (is it)!\" But when it set, he said: \"Unless my Lord guided me, I would surely be among the people gone astray"
  6,78,"Then, when he beheld the sun rising in all its splendor, he said: \"This is my Lord, (is it)?. This one is the greatest of all!\" But when it set, he said: \"O my people! Surely I am free from your association of partners with God and from whatever you associate with Him as partners"
  6,79,"I have turned my face (my whole being) with pure faith and submission to the One Who has originated the heavens and the earth each with particular features, and I am not one of those associating partners with God"
  6,80,"His people set out to remonstrate with him. Abraham said: \"Do you remonstrate with me concerning God, when He has guided me? I do not fear those that you associate with Him as partners (and that cannot even benefit or harm themselves, so what do I have to fear of your threats?). Whatever my Lord wills happens, and no evil befalls me unless He so wills. My Lord embraces all things in His Knowledge. Will you not, then, reflect and take heed"
  6,81,"And how should I fear those that you associate with God as partners when you do not fear to associate partners with Him without His having sent down on you any authority (to do so)? (Tell me,) then, which of the two parties has right to feel secure, if you have anything of knowledge"
