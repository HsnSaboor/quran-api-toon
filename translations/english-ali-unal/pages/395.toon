  28,78,"He said: \"All this has been given to me only by virtue of a certain knowledge that I have.\" Did he not know that God had destroyed among the generations before him men who were greater than him in power, and greater in wealth amassed? In fact, the criminals committed to accumulating sin are not asked about their sins (before they are destroyed so that they can defend themselves)"
  28,79,"(Korah) showed off before his people in all his pomp. Those who cared only for the life of this world said: \"Ah, if we but had the like of what Korah has been given! Indeed he is one of tremendous good fortune"
  28,80,"But those who had been granted (true) knowledge said: \"Woe to you! God’s reward for any who believes and does good, righteous deeds is better by far. But none save the patient (who persevere through adversities, in obedience to God and avoidance of sins) can ever attain to it"
  28,81,"Then We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling. There was then no host to help him against God, nor (for all his possessions) was he himself able to come to his own aid"
  28,82,"And on the morrow, those who had longed to be in his place the day before began to say: \"Woe to us! (We had forgotten that) God enlarges provision for whom He wills of His servants, and straitens it (for whom He wills). Had God not been gracious to us, He would have made us too swallowed up. Woe to us! (for we had forgotten that) the unbelievers do not prosper"
  28,83,"As for the abode of the Hereafter, We will assign it to those who do not seek arrogant power on earth nor cause corruption and disorder. The (truly desirable) outcome is for the God-revering, pious"
  28,84,"Whoever comes to God with a good deed will have better than it, and whoever comes with an evil deed – those who do evil deeds will not be recompensed save only for what they have done"
