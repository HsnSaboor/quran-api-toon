quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,184,Keep from disobedience to Him in reverence for Him Who has created you and all the earlier generations
  26,185,"They responded: \"You are only one of those who are bewitched"
  26,186,"You are but a mortal like us, and we have become convinced that you are certainly one of the liars"
  26,187,"So cause lumps from the sky to fall down upon us, if you are truthful in your claim (of Messengership)"
  26,188,"(Shu‘ayb) said: \"My Lord knows well all that you do.\" (Thus he referred their matter to God)"
  26,189,"So they denied him and in consequence, the punishment of the Day of the Overshadowing seized them. It surely was the punishment of an awesome day"
  26,190,"Surely in that (which took place between Shu‘ayb and his people) there is a sign (a great, important lesson). Most of them were not believers"
  26,191,"And surely your Lord is indeed the All-Glorious with irresistible might (able to punish whoever goes against His Glory), the All-Compassionate (especially towards His believing servants)"
  26,192,This (Qur’an) is indeed the Book of the Lord of the worlds being sent down by Him (in parts)
  26,193,The Trustworthy Spirit brings it down
  26,194,"On your heart, so that you may be one of the warners (entrusted with the Divine Revelation)"
  26,195,In clear Arabic tongue
  26,196,It has certainly been (prefigured) in the previous Scriptures
  26,197,Is it not an evidence enough for them that the scholars of the Children of Israel know it (to be so)
  26,198,But even if We had sent it down on any of the non-Arabs
  26,199,"And he had recited it to them, they would still not have believed in it"
  26,200,Thus (because of their willful persistence in unbelief and injustices) have We caused it (the Qur’an) to pass unheeded through the hearts of the disbelieving criminals
  26,201,"(Despite irrefutable proofs of its truth,) they will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment"
  26,202,"So it will come on them all of a sudden, when they are unaware (and incapable of awareness) of its coming"
  26,203,"Then they say: \"Are we to be granted some respite (so that we might reform ourselves)"
  26,204,"(This being so,) do they still wish for Our punishment to be hastened"
  26,205,"Have you considered that, if We let them enjoy life for many (more) years (– something they will desperately wish for when they face the punishment)"
  26,206,And the punishment they were promised comes upon them after that
