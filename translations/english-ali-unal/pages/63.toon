quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,"How do you disbelieve, seeing you are the ones to whom God’s Revelations are recited and His Messenger is amidst you? Whoever holds fast to God, he has certainly been guided to a straight path"
  3,102,"O you who believe! Keep from disobedience to God in reverent piety with all the reverence that is due to Him, and see that you do not die save as Muslims (submitted to Him exclusively)"
  3,103,"And hold fast all together to the rope of God and never be divided. Remember God’s favor upon you: you were once enemies and He reconciled your hearts so that through His favor you became like brothers. You stood on the brink of a pit of fire, and He delivered you from it. Thus God makes His signs of truth clear to you that you may be guided (to the Straight Path in all matters and be steadfast on it)"
  3,104,"There must be among you a community calling to good, and enjoining and actively promoting what is right and forbidding and trying to prevent evil (in appropriate ways). They are those who are the prosperous"
  3,105,Be not as those who split into parties and followed different ways after the manifest truths had come to them. Those are the ones for whom is a tremendous punishment
  3,106,"On the Day when some faces turn bright and some faces turn dark: and as to those whose faces have turned dark (they will be told): \"What, did you disbelieve after having believed? Taste, then, the punishment because you used to follow the way of unbelief"
  3,107,"As for those whose faces have turned bright, they are (embraced) in God’s mercy, therein abiding forever"
  3,108,"These are God’s Revelations: We recite them to you in truth, and God wills not any wrong to the world’s people"
