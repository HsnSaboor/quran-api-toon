quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  5,96,"(To hunt and eat) the game in the sea, its (fish and other) edibles are lawful for you, a provision for you and for travelers (whom you want to feed). However, while you are in the state of pilgrim sanctity, you are forbidden to hunt on land (or slaughter and eat of animals that you get others to hunt for you). Keep from disobedience to God in due reverence for Him, to Whom you will be gathered"
  5,97,"God has made the Ka‘bah, the Sacred House, a standard and maintenance for the people, and also the Sacred Months (during which fighting is forbidden), and the animals for sacrificial offering, and the (camels wearing the sacrificial) collars.

  5,98,"Know (also) that God is severe in punishment, and that God is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate"

Even so, if you ask about them while the Qur’an is being sent down, they (what is necessary to be made manifest) will be made manifest to you (to the extent that God wills). (Many things that you have either asked or want to ask about, but which God has left unspoken) God has absolved you thereof: God is All-Forgiving, All-Clement"
  5,102,"Indeed a people before you used to ask such questions (and demanded from their Prophet such things as particular miracles), and thereafter they fell into unbelief (through not carrying out the commandments given in answer to their questions or through willfully disbelieving in their Prophet despite the miracles worked)"
  5,103,"God has not ordained anything (in the nature) of a bahirah, nor a sa’ibah, nor a wasilah, nor ham. But those who disbelieve fabricate falsehoods against God – most of them do not reason and indeed are devoid of sense"
