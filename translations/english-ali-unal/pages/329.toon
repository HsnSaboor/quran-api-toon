  21,83,"And (mention) Job (among those whom We made leaders): he called out to his Lord, saying: \"Truly, affliction has visited me (so that I can no longer worship You as I must); and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful"

  21,90,"We answered his call, too, and bestowed upon him John, and cured his wife for him (so she was able) to bear a child.
