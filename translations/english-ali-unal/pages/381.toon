quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  27,45,"And certainly We sent to the Thamud their brother Salih (with the message): \"Worship God alone.\" (When he conveyed the Message) they split into factions in dispute with each other"
  27,46,"He (Salih) said (to them): \"O my people! Why do you seek to hasten the coming (upon you) of evil instead of good? Why do you not seek God’s forgiveness for your sins so that you may be shown mercy (to be granted a good, virtuous life in the world and eternal happiness in the Hereafter)"
  27,47,"They said: \"We augur ill of you and those who are with you.\" (Salih) answered: \"What you describe as augury is (something ordained) by God. But the truth is that you are a people who are being tried"
  27,48,"There were nine ringleaders in the city, causing disorder and corruption in the land and not setting things right"
  27,49,"They said, swearing in God’s Name: \"We will certainly swoop on him and his family by night suddenly and kill them all. Then we will assuredly say to his heirs that we did not witness the destruction of his family (nor of Salih himself); indeed we speak the truth"
  27,50,"And so they devised a scheme, and indeed We put Our will into force (to give them their just deserts), while they were not aware"
  27,51,So see how was the end of their scheme! We utterly destroyed them and their people all together
  27,52,"Those then are their houses, all lying in utter ruins because they were lost in wrongdoing. Surely in this is a sign (an important lesson) for a people seeking knowledge"
  27,53,And We saved those who believed and kept from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety
  27,54,"We also sent Lot as Messenger. He warned his people: \"Will you do that abhorrent indecency in plain view (of one another)"
  27,55,Will you go with lust to men in place of women? You are indeed an ignorant people with no sense (of decency and right and wrong)
