quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,88,"The leading ones among his people who were arrogant and oppressed the others said: \"We will surely banish you, O Shu‘ayb, and those who believe in your company from our township, or else you will return to our way (of faith and life).\" He (Shu‘ayb) said: \"What? Even though we abhor it"
  7,89,"Should we return to your way after God has saved us from it, then most certainly we would be fabricating lies in attribution to God. It is not for us to turn back to it, unless God, our Lord, should so will. Our Lord embraces all things within His Knowledge. In God do we put our trust. Our Lord! Judge between us and our people, making the truth manifest, for You are the Best in judging to make the truth manifest"
  7,90,"The leading ones who persisted in unbelief said (so as to put pressure upon the others among his people): \"Should you follow Shu‘ayb, you will then surely be the losers"
  7,91,"Then a shocking catastrophe seized them, so that they lay prostrate and lifeless in their very dwellings –"
  7,92,"Those who denied Shu‘ayb – as though they had not lived there in abundance – those who denied Shu‘ayb (and threatened the believers with loss and ruin), it was they who were the losers"
  7,93,"And Shu‘ayb left them, saying: \"O my people! I conveyed to you the messages of my Lord and gave you good counsel. How, then, could I mourn for a people ungrateful and persistent in unbelief"
  7,94,And We did not send a Prophet to a township but We seized its people with distress and hardship so that they might (wake from heedlessness and) be humble (invoking Us for forgiveness and turning to the truth)
  7,95,"Then (after this phase of trial and training) We changed the affliction into good (ease of life) until they increased (in numbers and wealth, and indulged in comforts) and said (without taking any lesson from it): \"Sometimes distress and sometimes happiness visited our forefathers (whereas we are living an easy life\". So We seized them all of a sudden without their being aware (of what was coming)"
