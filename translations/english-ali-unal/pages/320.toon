quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  20,114,"Absolutely exalted is God, the Supreme Sovereign, the Absolute Truth and Ever-Constant. Do not show haste (O Messenger) with (the receiving and memorizing of any Revelation included in) the Qur’an before it has been revealed to you in full, but say: \"My Lord, increase me in knowledge"
  20,115,"Assuredly We had made a covenant with Adam (and forbidden him to approach a tree in the Garden), but he acted forgetfully. We did not find resolve in him (at that moment)"
  20,116,"And when We said to the angels, \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam,\" they all prostrated themselves. But Iblis did not; he refused"
  20,117,"So We said: \"O Adam, surely this is an enemy to you and your wife; so let him not drive the two of you out of the Garden, lest you become distressed"
  20,118,Surely it is provided for you that you shall not go hungry therein nor become naked
  20,119,And that you shall not go thirsty therein nor suffer the sun’s heat
  20,120,"But Satan made an evil suggestion, saying: \"O Adam, shall I lead you to the tree of everlasting life and a kingdom that will never decay"
  20,121,"They both ate of it, so their shameful parts (and all the seemingly evil impulses in their creation) were apparent to them, and both began to cover themselves with leaves from the Garden. Adam disobeyed his Lord and fell into error"
  20,122,"Thereafter his Lord chose him (for His favor), accepted His repentance, and bestowed His guidance upon him"
  20,123,"We said: \"Go down from here, the two of you, all together (with Satan, and henceforth you will live a life,) some of you being the enemies of others. If there comes to you from Me a guidance (like a Book through a Messenger), then whoever follows My guidance (and turns to Me with faith and worship), will not go astray, nor will he be unhappy"
  20,124,"But as for him who turns away from My remembrance (and from the Book), his will be a suffocated life, and We will raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection"
  20,125,"He says: \"My Lord, why have You raised me up blind, while I used to be seeing (in my life of the world)"
