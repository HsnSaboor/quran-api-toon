quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  43,34,"And (silver) doors for their houses, and (silver) couches on which to recline"
  43,35,"And also adornments of gold (and other jewelry). Yet all this is nothing but a (fleeting) enjoyment of the present, worldly life. And the Hereafter with your Lord is only for the God-revering, pious"
  43,36,"Whoever willfully ignores the remembrance of the All-Merciful (and lives as if He did not exist always watching him), We assign to him a devil, who becomes his closest comrade"
  43,37,Such devils certainly bar them from the way (of truth). Yet they think (in themselves) that they are rightly guided
  43,38,"But in the end, when such a one comes to Us (on Judgment Day), he says (to his comrade): \"Ah, would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts. How evil a comrade"
  43,39,"It is of no avail to you at all today (this remorse after death). For you did wrong (in the world), and you will suffer the punishment together"

  43,41,"And whether We take you away from among them, and then We take retribution on them"

  43,46,"Assuredly We sent Moses to the Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our clear signs (miracles demonstrating Our being the sole Deity and Lord to be worshipped), and he said: \"I am a Messenger of the Lord of the worlds"
