quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,"And He creates the pairs, the male and the female"
  53,46,From a drop of (seminal) fluid when it is emitted
  53,47,And He has taken on Himself the other bringing forth
  53,48,And He it is Who grants abundant wealth and suffices (all need by His providing)
  53,49,And surely He it is Who is the Lord of Sirius
  53,50,And He destroyed the former (tribe of ) ‘Ad
  53,51,And the (tribe of) Thamud; He spared no (disbelieving criminal) among them
  53,52,And the people of Noah before; surely they were further in wrongdoing and further in rebellion
  53,53,(He also destroyed) the overthrown cities (of Lot’s people)
  53,54,So that there covered them that which covered
  53,55,Then which of the gifts of your Lord do you dispute about
  53,56,And this (Messenger) is a warner like the warners of old
  53,57,That (the Last Hour) which is bound to draw near has drawn near
  53,58,None besides God can disclose it (or remove the dread and suffering it entails)
  53,59,Do you then deem this Discourse (which enables your eternal salvation) strange
  53,60,And do you laugh and not weep (in consideration of your recalcitrance and sinfulness)
  53,61,Moreover entertain yourselves (with fun and games)
  53,62,"Rather: prostrate before God (in submission) and worship Him (so that He may protect you from the dread and suffering of the Last Hour)"
  54,1,"The Last Hour has drawn near, and the moon has split"
  54,2,"Whenever they see a miracle, they turn from it in aversion and say: \"This is sorcery like many others, one after the other"
  54,3,"And they have denied (Prophethood and whatever sign the Prophet has shown them), and followed their lusts and caprices. Yet every matter has its appointed time (and so they will come to know the truth)"
  54,4,And for certain there have already come to them reports (of the Hereafter and former peoples) wherein is ample warning to deter (them from their ways)
  54,5,"All this (which is included in the Qur’an) is consummate wisdom, but warnings do not avail (such people)"
  54,6,(Seeing that they reject your call) withdraw from them. The Day will come when the caller will call (all the people) to something exceptionally terrible
