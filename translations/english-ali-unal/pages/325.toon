quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  21,36,"When those who persistently disbelieve see you, they make you but a target of mockery, (saying to each other): \"Is this the one who speaks against your deities?\" (They cannot bear to hear their false deities denied.) And yet it is they themselves who deny the Book of the All-Merciful (Who has created them and embraces them with mercy, without recognizing this as a crime)"
  21,37,"Humankind are by nature impatient as if made of haste, (this is why they ask derisively when the punishment with which they are threatened will come.) I will soon show you the truth of My threats, so do not ask Me to hasten it"
  21,38,"But they insistently ask, \"After all, when will this threat be fulfilled? (Answer us, O you who believe in it,) if you are people of truth"
  21,39,"If only those who persistently disbelieve knew the time when they will be unable to ward off the Fire from their faces, and from their backs, and they will never be helped against it"
  21,40,"But it will come upon them all of a sudden and dumbfound them. They will not be able to avert it, nor will they be given respite to escape it"
  21,41,"Indeed, Messengers were mocked before you (O Muhammad), but the very thing, because of which the people used to mock them, overwhelmed those who scoffed at the Messengers (to humiliate them)"
  21,42,"Say: \"Who could protect you by night and day from the All-Merciful, if He wills to punish you?\" And yet, they turn away from the Book of their Lord in aversion"
  21,43,"Or do they really have deities apart from Us to defend them? They (those alleged deities) are not even able to help themselves, nor can they get any help and friendship from Us"
  21,44,"The truth is that We have provided for those (polytheist sinners) and their forefathers to enjoy life, so that they have lived for a long time in ease and safety. (This is why they think that they will live forever in prosperity.) Whereas do they not see how We deal with the earth, reducing it of its outlying parts? So, can they really be the victors"
