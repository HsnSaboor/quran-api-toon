quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  42,16,"And as for those who contend about God (defying His Lordship or struggling against His Religion) after His call has been accepted (and His Religion recognized as true), their contention is void in their Lord’s sight, and (His) wrath (condemnation) is upon them, and for them is a severe punishment"
  42,17,"God is He Who has sent down the Book with truth and the Balance, (setting out the truth and what is right in all matters). And for all you know, the Last Hour may well be near"
  42,18,"Those who do not believe in it (derisively) ask it to be hastened; whereas those who believe hold it in awe, and know that it is true (certain to come). Be aware! those who dispute concerning the Last Hour have indeed gone far astray"
  42,19,"God is All-Gracious to His servants. He grants provision to whom He wills (in the manner and degree that He wills); and He is the All-Strong, the All-Glorious with irresistible might"
  42,20,"Whoever desires (and strives to gain) the harvest of the Hereafter, We increase him in his harvest; and whoever desires the harvest of the world, We grant him out of that, and he has no portion in the Hereafter"
  42,21,"Or do they have partners with God who have prescribed for them in the Religion what God has not allowed (and so they judge and act however they wish)? Had it not been for a decree (already issued by God, postponing the final, decisive judgment) between people, it would indeed have been judged between them. Surely for the wrongdoers there is a painful punishment"
  42,22,"You will see the wrongdoers (who presume to lay down a way of life in the name of religion other than God’s) full of fear on account of what they have earned, and it will inevitably befall them. As for those who believe and do good, righteous deeds, they will be in the luxuriant meadows of the Gardens. They will have whatever they wish prepared in God’s Presence. That indeed is the great favor"
