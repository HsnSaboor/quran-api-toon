quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  26,112,"(Noah) said: \"What knowledge could I have about what they were engaged in doing (before they became believers)"
  26,113,Indeed their reckoning rests with none but my Lord; if only you could understand
  26,114,And it is not expected of me that I should repel the believers
  26,115,I am but a plain warner (responsible for no other duty than the duty to warn)
  26,116,"They said: \"If you do not desist, O Noah, you will certainly be stoned to death in utter abjection"
  26,117,"(After ages of struggle) he said (in supplication): \"My Lord! Indeed, my people have denied me"
  26,118,"So judge between me and them a conclusive (and everlasting) separation, and save me and the believers in my company"
  26,119,So We saved him and those who were with him in the laden Ark
  26,120,"And then, following their rescue, We caused the rest to drown"
  26,121,"Surely in that (which took place between Noah and his people) there is a sign (a great, important lesson). Most of them were not believers"
  26,122,"And surely your Lord is indeed the All-Glorious with irresistible might (able to punish whoever goes against His Glory), the All-Compassionate (especially towards His believing servants)"
  26,123,The ‘Ad denied (Hud and thereby meant to deny all) the Messengers
  26,124,"(Recall) when their brother Hud said to them (by way of timely warning): \"Will you not keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and seek refuge with His protection"
  26,125,"Surely I am a Messenger to you, trustworthy"
  26,126,So keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and obey me
  26,127,I ask of you no wage for that (for conveying God’s Message); my wage is only due from the Lord of the worlds
  26,128,Will you continue to build on every high spot monumental buildings for fun and show
  26,129,And make for yourselves great castles (as if) hoping that you might live for ever
  26,130,"And when you strike and seize (others and their goods), strike and seize in the style of tyrants"
  26,131,So keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and obey me
  26,132,Keep from disobedience to Him Who has amply provided you with (all that) you are well-aware of
  26,133,Amply provided you with flocks and herds and children
  26,134,And gardens and springs
  26,135,Indeed I fear for you the punishment of an awesome Day
  26,136,"They responded: \"It is all the same to us whether you preach or are not of those who preach"
