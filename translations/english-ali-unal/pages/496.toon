quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  44,1,Ha. Mim
  44,2,By the Book clear in itself and clearly showing the truth
  44,3,We sent it down on a night full of blessings; surely We have ever been warning (humankind since their creation)
  44,4,In that night every affair is identified and made distinct for wise purposes
  44,5,As a command issued from Our Presence; surely We have ever been sending Messengers (from among the angels and human beings to convey Our decrees and guide)
  44,6,"As a mercy from your Lord – surely He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing –"
  44,7,"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if you would but seek certainty (about the Messenger and the Book he brings)"
  44,8,"There is no deity but He, giving life and causing to die; your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers"
  44,9,"Yet (they do not desire certainty; instead) they are in an irrecoverable doubt, lost in the playthings of the worldly life"
  44,10,Then watch (O Messenger) for the day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke
  44,11,"Which will engulf the people, (causing them to exclaim): \"This is a painful punishment"
  44,12,"Our Lord! Remove this punishment from us, for now we are true believers"
  44,13,"How is a reminder possible for them (such that their profession of faith could be true), seeing that there has come to them a Messenger making the truth clear (and embodying it in every element of his life and character)"
  44,14,"But they turn away from him and say (of him): \"One taught by others, a madman"
  44,15,"We will hold back the punishment for a little (while), but you will turn back (to your former ways of unbelief, whose outcome is a punishment everlasting) –"
  44,16,On the day when We will seize with the mightiest grasp. We will indeed take retribution
  44,17,"Before them, assuredly We tried the people of the Pharaoh, when there came to them a noble Messenger"
  44,18,"Saying: \"Deliver to me the servants of God! I am a trustworthy Messenger sent to you (by God)"
