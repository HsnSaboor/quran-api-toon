quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,158,"And, assuredly, if you die or are killed, it is to God that you will be gathered"
  3,159,"It was by a mercy from God that (at the time of the setback), you (O Messenger) were lenient with them (your Companions). Had you been harsh and hard-hearted, they would surely have scattered away from about you. Then pardon them, pray for their forgiveness, and take counsel with them in the affairs (of public concern), and when you are resolved (on a course of action), put your trust in God. Surely God loves those who put their trust (in Him)"
  3,160,"If God helps you, there will be none who can overcome you; if He forsakes you, who is there that can help you thereafter? In God, then, let the believers put all their trust"
  3,161,"It is not conceivable that a Prophet defrauds; and whoever defrauds (by stealing from public property or war-gains) will come with what he gained by his fraud on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soul shall be repaid in full what it has earned (while in the world), and they will not be wronged"
  3,162,"What, is he who strives after God’s good pleasure and approval like him who is laden with God’s condemnation and whose refuge is Hell? How evil a destination to arrive at"
  3,163,"They are in varying grades in God’s sight, and God sees well all that they do"
  3,164,"Assuredly, God has done the believers a great kindness by raising among them a Messenger of their own, reciting to them His Revelations, and purifying them (of false beliefs and doctrines, and sins, and all kinds of uncleanness), and instructing them in the Book and the Wisdom. Whereas, before that, they were lost in obvious error"
  3,165,"And do you, now that a disaster has befallen you, though you inflicted the double (of that on your foes at Badr), say: \"Whence is this?\" Say (to them, O Messenger): \"It is from your own selves.\" Surely God has full power over everything"
