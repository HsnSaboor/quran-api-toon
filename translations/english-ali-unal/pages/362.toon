quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,21,"Those who (being unbelievers) do not expect to meet Us (in the Hereafter) say: \"Why are no angels sent down on us or (why) do we not see our Lord?\" Assuredly they are far too arrogant of themselves (demanding what is impossible for them), and exceed all bounds (in their presumption)"
  25,22,"The Day when they see the angels – there will be no good tidings on that Day for the disbelieving criminals, and they will cry out to the angels in fear: \"Keep away, away from us"
  25,23,"And We will turn to deal with all the (supposedly good) deeds that they did (in the world), and will reduce them all to dust particles scattered about"
  25,24,"Whereas the companions of Paradise will, on that Day, have appointed for them the best abode and the fairest place of repose"
  25,25,On that Day the heaven will split asunder with the clouds (covering it) and the angels will be made to descend in a majestic descending
  25,26,"The sovereignty on that Day will absolutely and belong to the All-Merciful, (which He will exercise then with no intermediary veil of cause and effect). It will be a hard day for the unbelievers"
  25,27,"On that Day the wrongdoer will bite at his hands, saying (with remorse) \"Oh, would that I had taken a way in the company of the Messenger"
  25,28,"Oh, woe is me! Would that I had not taken so-and-so for a friend"
  25,29,"Indeed, he led me astray from the Reminder (the Qur’an) once it had come to me. Satan has proved to be a betrayer of humankind"
  25,30,"And the Messenger says: \"My Lord! Surely my people have made this Qur’an something worthy of no attention"
  25,31,So for every Prophet We have made an enemy (band) from among the disbelieving criminals committed to accumulating sins. But Your Lord is sufficient as a guide (to truth and the right course of action) and a helper (against the plots and practices of your enemies)
  25,32,"Those who disbelieve say (by way of yet another false argument for unbelief): \"Why has the Qur’an not been sent down on him all at once?\" (We send it down in parts) so that We may (impress it on your mind and) establish your heart with it, and We are conveying it distinctly and gradually, (one part supporting the other, and providing guidance and instruction for emerging occasions)"
