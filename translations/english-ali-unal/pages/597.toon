quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the fig and the olive
  95,2,And Mount Sinai
  95,3,And this City secure
  95,4,Surely We have created human of the best stature as the perfect pattern of creation
  95,5,Then We have reduced him to the lowest of the low
  95,6,"Except those who believe and do good, righteous deeds, so there is for them a reward constant and beyond measure"
  95,7,"What, then, (O human,) causes you, after all (these realities), to deny the Last Judgment"
  95,8,Is not God the Best of judges and the Most Powerful of sovereigns
  96,1,"Read in and with the Name of your Lord, Who has created –"
  96,2,Created human from a clot clinging (to the wall of the womb)
  96,3,"Read, and your Lord is the All-Munificent"
  96,4,Who has taught (human) by the pen –
  96,5,Taught human what he did not know
  96,6,"No indeed, but (despite all His favors to him), human is unruly and rebels"
  96,7,"In that he sees himself as self-sufficient, independent (of his Lord)"
  96,8,But to your Lord surely is the return (when everyone will account for their life)
  96,9,Have you considered the one who would impede and forbid
  96,10,A servant (of God) when he prays
  96,11,Have you considered if he is (and surely he is) on the right way
  96,12,Or exhorts others to righteousness and piety
  96,13,Have you considered if he himself denies the truth and turns away (from it)
  96,14,Does he (who would impede the servant in his Prayer) not know that God sees (all that people do)
  96,15,"No indeed! If he does not desist, We will certainly seize and drag him by the forelock"
  96,16,"A lying, sinful forelock"
  96,17,Then let him summon (to his help his) council
  96,18,We will summon the guards of Hell
  96,19,"By no means! Pay no heed to him (in his attempt to prevent the Prayer), but prostrate and draw near (to God)"
