quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,61,"When the two hosts came in view of each other, the companions of Moses said: \"We are certainly overtaken"
  26,62,"He replied: \"Certainly not. My Lord is surely with me; He will guide me (to deliverance)"
  26,63,"We revealed to Moses: \"Strike the sea with your staff.\" Thereupon the sea split, and each part became like a towering mountain"
  26,64,We brought the others (the Pharaoh and his host) close to the same spot
  26,65,And We saved Moses and all those who were with him
  26,66,"Afterwards, We caused the others to drown"
  26,67,"Surely in that (which took place between Moses and Pharaoh) there is a sign (a great, important lesson). Most of them (the Pharaoh’s people) were not believers"
  26,68,"And surely your Lord is indeed the All-Glorious with irresistible might (able to punish whoever goes against His Glory), the All-Compassionate (especially towards His believing servants)"
  26,69,Now recite to them this exemplary history of Abraham
  26,70,"When he said to his father and his people: \"What is it that you worship"
  26,71,"They said: \"We worship idols; and (even though they are made of wood and stone) we are ever devoted to them (as they are our deities)"
  26,72,"(Abraham) said: \"Do they hear you when you invoke them"
  26,73,Or do they benefit you (when you worship them) or harm (you when you do not)
  26,74,"They replied: \"But we found our forefathers doing the same"
  26,75,"(Abraham) said: \"So, have you considered what you have been worshipping"
  26,76,You and all your forefathers that have passed (before you)
  26,77,"I see that they (all that you worship) are enemies to me, but the Lord of the worlds is not"
  26,78,He Who has created me and so guides me (to whatever is to my benefit in both this world and the next)
  26,79,And He it is Who gives me food and drink
  26,80,"And Who, when I fall ill, heals me"
  26,81,And Who will make me die and then will give me life again
  26,82,"And Who, I hope, will forgive me my faults on Judgment Day"
  26,83,"My Lord! Grant me true, wise judgment, and join me with the righteous"
