quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,39,"All this is (part) of the Wisdom which your Lord has revealed to you (O Messenger). (As the source and basis of all wisdom), do not set up with God another deity, or you will be cast into Hell, blamed and disowned"
  17,40,"Has, then, your Lord distinguished you (O unbelievers) by preferring for you sons, and taken for Himself from among the angels daughters? Most certainly you utter an awful, horrendous saying"
  17,41,"We have set out (the truths) in diverse ways in this Qur’an, so that they may reflect and be mindful, but all this increases them (the unbelievers) only in their aversion (to truth)"
  17,42,"Say: \"If there were, as they assert, deities apart from Him, surely they would seek a way to the Master of the Supreme Throne (the dominion of the creation)"
  17,43,"All-Glorified is He, and absolutely exalted, immeasurably high above all that they say"
  17,44,"The seven heavens and the earth, and whoever is therein, glorify Him. There is nothing that does not glorify Him with His praise (proclaiming that He alone is God, without peer or partner, and all praise belongs to Him exclusively), but you cannot comprehend their glorification. Surely He is (despite what His servants have deserved from Him) All-Clement, All-Forgiving"
  17,45,"When you recite the Qur’an, We place an invisible veil between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter (and who, by making themselves deaf and blind to the creation’s praise of its Creator, make themselves incapable of such belief)"
  17,46,"And over their hearts We lay veils (made from their ill-intention, wrongdoing, and arrogance) that prevent them from grasping it (the Qur’an), and in their ears, heaviness. When you make mention of your Lord in the Qur’an as the One (the Unique Divine Being), they turn their backs in aversion"
  17,47,"We know best what they wish to hear when they listen to you and that, when they are secluded among themselves, these wrongdoers say (to one another): \"You are following but a man bewitched"
  17,48,See what strange comparisons they invent about you. They have altogether strayed and are now unable to find a way (to the truth)
  17,49,"And they say: \"What! is it when we have already become bones and particles of dust – is it then that we will be raised as a new creation"
