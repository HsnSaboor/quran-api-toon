quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,82,"So when Our judgment came to pass, We overturned (those sinful towns), and rained down on them stones of baked clay one after another"
  11,83,(Each stone) marked out by your Lord (for a particular individual). And they are never far from wrongdoers (in all times and places)
  11,84,"And (to the people of) Midian (We sent as Messenger) their brother Shu‘ayb. He said (conveying the same message): \"O my people! Worship God: you have no deity other than Him. Do not give short measure and weight (in your dealings). Surely I see you affluent (in wealth which you have gained in unlawful ways), and I fear for you the punishment of an all-encompassing Day"
  11,85,"O my people! Give full measure and weight, with perfect equity, and do not wrong deprive people by depriving them of what is rightfully theirs, and do not go about acting wickedly in the land, causing disorder and corruption"
  11,86,"What God leaves with you (as lawful profit) is better for you, if you are believers. I am not a keeper and watcher over you"
  11,87,"They said: \"O Shu‘ayb! Does your Prayer-rite command you that we should forsake all that our forefathers used to worship, or that we should cease doing whatever we wish with our property? Surely you are one mild-mannered, and the one right-minded"
  11,88,"He answered: \"O my people! What do you think – if I stand on a clear evidence from my Lord, and out of His provision He provides for me? I do not (in hope of worldly gain and provoking disorder) act in opposition to you (myself doing) what I ask you to avoid. What I seek is only to set things right so far as I am able. My success in my task depends on God alone. In Him have I put my trust, and to Him do I always turn with all my heart"
