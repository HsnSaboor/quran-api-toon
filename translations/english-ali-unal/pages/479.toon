quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  41,21,"They will ask their skins, \"Why have you borne witness against us?\" They will answer: \"God Who makes everything speak has made us speak.\" It is He Who has created you in the first instance, and to Him you are being brought back"
  41,22,"You did not seek to veil yourselves (when sinning) without ever considering that your ears or your eyes or your skins would one day bear witness against you. Moreover, you supposed that God did not know most of what you did habitually"
  41,23,"It is that supposition of yours which you entertained about your Lord that has tumbled you down into perdition, and so you have come to be among the losers"
  41,24,"If they endure it (or do not endure it), still the Fire will be an everlasting dwelling for them. If they ask for favor (to be saved from it, or do not ask), still they are not of those who will be shown favor (and saved)"
  41,25,"(In return for their preferring unbelief and sinfulness over belief and piety) We have assigned them comrades (of satanic disposition, not right-minded) who deck out their past (deeds) and their present (intentions) to be appealing to them. And the word (the sentence of punishment passed) on the communities of jinn and humankind before them (who were self-righteous in the same way) has also been their due. Surely they are the losers"
  41,26,"Those who disbelieve say: \"Do not listen to this Qur’an, and speak random noise (during its recitation) so that you may prevail over it"
  41,27,"But We will certainly make those who disbelieve taste a severe punishment, and certainly recompense them for the worst of what they keep doing"
  41,28,"That is the recompense of God’s enemies – the Fire. Therein they will have the everlasting abode, as a deserving recompense for rejecting Our signs and Revelations obstinately"
  41,29,"Those who disbelieve will say (as they enter the Fire): \"Our Lord! Show us those of both the jinn and humankind that led us astray, that we may trample them underfoot and they will be of the most humiliated"
