quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,And all that is in the breasts is laid open and made out
  100,11,Surely their Lord on that Day will be fully aware of them
  101,1,"The sudden, mighty strike"
  101,2,"What is the sudden, mighty strike"
  101,3,"What enables you to perceive what the sudden, mighty strike is"
  101,4,The day (when it occurs) humans will be like moths scattered about
  101,5,And the mountains will be like carded wool
  101,6,"And then, the one whose scales are heavy (with faith and good deeds)"
  101,7,He will be in a life of contentment
  101,8,Whereas the one whose scales are light (as devoid of faith and accepted good deeds)
  101,9,He will have his home in a bottomless pit
  101,10,What enables you to perceive what it is
  101,11,It is a fire burning fiercely
  102,1,"Competing in increase of worldly goods (seeking and then boasting of the acquisition of things, wealth, pedigree, and posterity) distracts you (from the proper purpose of life)"
  102,2,Until you come to the graves
  102,3,No indeed! You will surely come to understand (when death comes to you)
  102,4,"Again, no indeed! You will surely come to understand it (when you are raised from the dead)"
  102,5,No indeed! If only you knew with certainty of knowledge (then you would not disorder priorities)
  102,6,You will most surely see the Blazing Flame
  102,7,"Then (when you go to the other world), you will most surely see it with the eye of certainty"
  102,8,And on that Day you will most surely be questioned as to all the favors (bestowed on you)
