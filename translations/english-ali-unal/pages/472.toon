quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,41,O my people! How is it with me that I call you to salvation when you call me to the Fire
  40,42,"You call me so that I should disbelieve in God and associate with Him partners about whose partnership I have no sure knowledge; and I call you to the All-Glorious with irresistible might (Able to destroy whoever rebels against Him), the All-Forgiving (Who forgives whoever turns to Him in repentance)"
  40,43,"Without doubt you call me but to one who has no title (to be called to) in the world, or in the Hereafter; our return will be to God, and those who (transgressing all bounds) are wasteful (of their God-given faculties) – they will be companions of the Fire"
  40,44,"Soon you will remember all that I now am telling you. As for me, I commit my affair to God (in full submission). Surely God sees the servants well"
  40,45,"So God preserved him from the evils they schemed (against him), while a most evil punishment overwhelmed the clan (the court and military aristocracy) of the Pharaoh"
  40,46,"The Fire: they are exposed to it morning and evening; and when the Last Hour comes in (and the Judgment is established, it is ordered): \"Admit the clan of the Pharaoh into the severest punishment"
  40,47,"See, how they will dispute with each other in the Fire; so the weak ones (who blindly obeyed the leaders of unbelief) will say to those who acted arrogantly and oppressed (others): \"Surely we were your followers; now can you therefore rid us of (even) a portion of the Fire"
  40,48,"Those who were arrogant (and oppressed others) will say: \"We are all together in this (Fire)! God has indeed judged between the servants (and all must face a reckoning and meet their deserts)"
  40,49,"Those who are in the Fire will cry to the keepers of Hell: \"Call upon your Lord that He may lighten the punishment for us for one day (at least)"
