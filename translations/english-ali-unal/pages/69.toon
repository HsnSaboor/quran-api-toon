quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  3,149,"O you who believe! If you follow those who disbelieve (the hypocrites and Jews in Madinah who spread negative propaganda concerning the events at Uhud), they will drive you back on your heels (into unbelief), and you will turn utter losers (in both this world and the next)"
  3,150,"But God is your Guardian and Owner, and He is the best of helpers"
  3,151,"We will throw alarm into the hearts of those who disbelieve because they associate with God partners, for which He has sent no authority at all; and their refuge will be the Fire; and how evil is the dwelling of the wrongdoers"
  3,152,"God did indeed fulfill His promise to you when you routed them by His leave, up to (the point) when you lost heart, and disagreed about the order (given to the archers among you not to leave their positions), and disobeyed, after He had brought you within sight of that (victory) for which you were longing. Among you were such as cared for this world, and among you were such as cared for the Hereafter. Then He diverted you from them (the enemy), that He might try you. But He has surely pardoned you: God has grace and bounty for the believers"
  3,153,"When you were running off (from the battlefield), paying no heed to anyone, and at your rear the Messenger was calling out to you (to stay in the battle), then God requited you with grief after grief so that you might not grieve either for what escaped you, or for what befell you. God is fully aware of all that you do"
