quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  76,26,"And during part of the night prostrate to Him, and glorify Him a long part of the night"
  76,27,"Those (sinful unbelievers) love and prefer that which is in advance (the present, worldly life), and neglect a grievous Day ahead of them"
  76,28,"It is We Who have created them and made firm their composition, and whenever We will, We can change their structure and character entirely"
  76,29,"All this is an admonition and reminder, and so let him who wills, take a path to his Lord"
  76,30,"You cannot will unless God wills. Surely God is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  76,31,"He admits whom He wills into His mercy; and as to the wrongdoers, He has prepared for them a painful punishment"
  77,1,By the companies (of angels) sent one after another for some good results

  77,3,And by those enfolding the Scrolls of Revelation
  77,4,And serving (for right and wrong) to be separated with all clarity
  77,5,And so bringing down the Revelation
  77,6,In order that some may have the means to ask for forgiveness and that some may be warned
  77,7,Surely what you are promised is bound to take place

  77,9,And when the sky is rent asunder
  77,10,And when the mountains are blown away (as dust)
  77,11,And when the time for the Messengers (to bear witness for or against their communities) is appointed

  77,13,For the Day of Judgment and Distinction (between people according to how they believed and acted in the world)
  77,14,What enables you to perceive what the Day of Judgment and Distinction is
  77,15,Woe on that Day to those who deny (the Day)
  77,16,Did We not destroy the ancient peoples (who denied)
  77,17,So do We make the later generations (of the same standing) follow them (in being destroyed)
  77,18,For thus do We deal with the disbelieving criminals
  77,19,Woe on that Day to those who deny
