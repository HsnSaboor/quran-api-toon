quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"(The hypocrites are) those who wait to see what befalls you: thus if a victory comes to you from God, they say, \"Were we not with you?\" but if the unbelievers meet with a success, they say (to them:) \"Did we not gain leverage over you (by not joining the believers and weakening them from within) and did we not defend you from the believers?\" God will judge between you (and them) on the Day of Resurrection, and never will God allow the unbelievers to find a way (to triumph) over the (true) believers"
  4,142,"The hypocrites would trick God, whereas it is God who \"tricks\" them (by causing them to fall into their own traps). When they rise to do the Prayer, they rise lazily, and to be seen by people (to show them that they are Muslims); and they do not remember God (within or outside the Prayer) save a little"
  4,143,"Vacillating between (the believers) and (the unbelievers), neither with these, nor with those. Whoever God leads astray, for him you can never find a sound way (to follow)"
  4,144,O you who believe! Do not take the unbelievers for guardians and confidants in preference to the believers; or do you want to offer God a manifest proof against yourselves (of being hypocrites and so incur His punishment)
  4,145,"Assuredly, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth of the Fire; and you will never find for them any helper (against the Fire)"
  4,146,"Except those who repent and mend their ways and hold fast to God and practice their Religion purely and sincerely for God’s sake: those (who repent) are counted with the believers, and in time God will grant to the believers a tremendous reward"
  4,147,"What should God punish you if you are grateful (to Him) and believe (in Him)? God is Ever-Responsive to gratitude, All-Knowing"
