quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"Those who believe (look forward to a new surah conveying knowledge of Divine truths and God’s new commandments being sent down, and) say: \"If only a new surah were sent down!\" But when a decisive surah has been sent down in which fighting is mentioned (clearly as a commanded duty), you see those in whose hearts there is sickness looking at you with a look of one swooning to death. That is, in fact, what is expected of them"
  47,21,"(Whereas, what true believers are expected to do in response to any Divine order is) obedience and a proper word. So, if they were true to God when the command has been resolved upon (and it calls them to do what their pledge to God requires them), it would certainly be good for them"
  47,22,"But is it to be expected of you (O hypocritical ones), that you will break your promise and turn away (from God’s commandments), and cause disorder and corruption in the land, and sever the ties of kinship"
  47,23,"Such are they whom God has cursed (excluded from His mercy), and so He has made them deaf and blinded their eyes (to the truth)"
  47,24,"Do they not meditate earnestly on the Qur’an, or are there locks on the hearts (that are particular to them so that they are as if deaf and blind, and incapable of understanding the truth)"
  47,25,"Surely those who have turned back as apostates after (God’s) guidance has become clear to them, Satan has seduced them; he has implanted in them long-term worldly ambitions"
  47,26,"This is because they have said to those who are averse to what God has sent down: \"We will obey you in some issues.\" God knows their secrets"
  47,27,"So, how (will it be) when the angels take their souls at death, striking their faces and their backs"
  47,28,"This is because they have followed what incurs God’s wrath (condemnation), and are averse to what pleases Him, and so He has caused all their (previous good) deeds to go to waste"
  47,29,Or do those in whose hearts is sickness think that God will not bring to light their spite (against the Divine Religion and its followers)
