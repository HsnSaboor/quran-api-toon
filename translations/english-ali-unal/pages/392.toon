quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  28,51,"Assuredly We have conveyed to them the Word (one verse after the other, and one chapter after the other for their good) so that they may reflect and be mindful"
  28,52,Those to whom We granted the Book before it do believe in it
  28,53,"When it is recited to them, they say: \"We believe in it. Surely it is the truth from our Lord. Even before this We were such as submitted (to the Divine Will)"
  28,54,"These will be granted their reward twice over because they have remained steadfast (in following their religion free of falsehood and so keeping themselves above all prejudices to believe in and follow the Qur’an and Muhammad); and they repel evil with good and out of what We have provided for them (of wealth, knowledge, power, etc.) they spend (in God’s cause and for the needy, and purely for the good pleasure of God)"
  28,55,"When they hear any vain (useless or aggressive) talk, they turn away from it, without reciprocating it, and say (to those who are engaged in it): \"To us are accounted our deeds, and to you, your deeds. Peace be upon you! We do not seek to mix with the ignorant (those unaware of God, true guidance and right and wrong)"
  28,56,You cannot guide to truth whomever you like but God guides whomever He wills. He knows best who are guided (and amenable to guidance)
  28,57,"They say: \"Should we follow this Guidance in your company, we would be annihilated in our land.\" Have We not established them in a secure sanctuary to which, as a provision from Us, products of all kinds are brought? But most of them do not know (that it is We Who protect and provide for them, and assume that it is their worshipping idols that attracts other Arab tribes to Makkah for trade and that protects them from being attacked by those tribes)"
  28,58,"How many a township have We destroyed that exulted insolently on account of their affluence. Those are their dwellings – except for few people for a short time only, they have never been dwelt in after them. It is always We Who are the inheritors (Who remain as the Ever-Living when all else have passed away)"
  28,59,"Yet Your Lord never destroys townships without first raising up in their mother-town a Messenger who conveys to them Our messages. We never destroy townships, save that their people are wrongdoers (who associate partners with God and are given to many injustices)"
