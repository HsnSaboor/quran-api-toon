quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,It is those who do not believe in the Hereafter who name the angels (whom they regard as God’s daughters) with feminine names
  53,28,"They have no knowledge of this. They follow nothing other than conjecture, and conjecture can never substitute for anything of the truth"
  53,29,"So withdraw from those who turn away from Our Book and remembrance, and desire nothing but the life of this world"
  53,30,"Such is their sum of knowledge (limited by desires of the moment, and the falsehoods they have inherited unthinkingly and become used to, limited to the outer surface of things). Surely your Lord knows best him who has gone astray, and He knows best him who goes right (following the Straight Path of his Lord)"
  53,31,"To God belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and (since He knows best him who has gone astray and him who follows the right path) He will recompense those who do evil with what they have done, and recompense those who do good with the best reward"
  53,32,"Those who avoid the major sins and indecent, shameful deeds (which are in fact included in the major sins), only falling into small fault, – surely your Lord is of extensive forgiveness. He knows you well when He originates you from (the particles of) earth, and when you are hidden (fetuses) in the wombs of your mothers. So do not hold yourselves pure (sinless; it is vain self-justification). He knows best him who keeps from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety"
  53,33,Have you considered him who turns away (from your call)
  53,34,"He has given (the needy) a little, then he is stern (in not giving)"
  53,35,"Does he have knowledge of the Unseen, and so he sees (what is to happen in the future)"
  53,36,Or has he not been informed of all (that is to follow and) was in the Scrolls of Moses
  53,37,And of Abraham who discharged his due (fulfilling all his duties to perfection)
  53,38,"That no soul, as bearer of burden, is made to bear the burden of another"
  53,39,And that human has only that for which he labors
  53,40,And his labor will be brought forth to be seen
  53,41,And afterward he will be repaid for it with fullest payment
  53,42,And in your Lord everything ends
  53,43,"And He it is Who (by His Will, Power, and creation) enables to laugh and to weep"
  53,44,And He it is Who causes to die and gives life
