  5,24,"They said: \"O Moses! By no means will we enter it as long as they are there. Go forth, then, you and your Lord, and fight, both of you. (As for ourselves) we will be sitting just here"
  5,25,"He (Moses) said (turning to His Lord with entreaty): \"O my Lord! I have power over none except my own self and my brother (Aaron) only; so You judge and separate between us and this transgressing people"
  5,26,"He (God) said (passing this judgment): \"Then, this (land) shall now be forbidden to them for forty years, while they shall wander about on earth, bewildered. Do not grieve over that transgressing people"
  5,27,"Narrate to them (O Messenger) in truth the exemplary experience of the two sons of Adam, when they each offered a sacrifice, and it was accepted from one of them, and not accepted from the other. \"I will surely kill you,\" said (he whose sacrifice was not accepted). \"God accepts only from the sincere and truly pious,\" said the other"
  5,28,"Yet if you stretch out your hand against me to kill me, I will not stretch out my hand against you to kill you. Surely I fear God, the Lord of the worlds"
  5,29,(In refusing to fight you and remembering to fear God) I desire indeed (to warn you) that you will bear the burden of my sin (were I to take part in fighting you) and your own sin (for seeking to kill me) and so you will be among the companions of the Fire.
