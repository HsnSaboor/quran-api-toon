quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,None will enter it to roast but the most wicked
  92,16,Who denies (My Message) and turns away
  92,17,And far removed from it (the Fire) will be he who keeps farthest away from disobedience to God in greater reverence for Him and piety
  92,18,"Who spends his wealth (in God’s cause and for the needy), so that he may grow in purity"
  92,19,"Without anyone who has favored him so that he should spend in return for it, or expecting any reward in return for what he spends"
  92,20,"(Rather, he spends) only in longing for the good pleasure of his Lord, the Most High"
  92,21,He will certainly be contented (he with his Lord and his Lord with him)
  93,1,By the forenoon
  93,2,And the night when it has grown dark and most still
  93,3,"Your Lord has not forsaken you, nor has He become displeased with you"
  93,4,"Assuredly, what comes after will be better for you than what has gone before"
  93,5,And assuredly He will increasingly grant you his favors one after another and you will be contented
  93,6,Did He not find you an orphan and give shelter (to you)
  93,7,"And find you unguided (by God’s Messengership), and guide (you)"
  93,8,"And find you in want, and make you self-sufficient"
  93,9,"Therefore, do not oppress the orphan"
  93,10,Nor chide and drive away the petitioner
  93,11,"And as for the favor of your Lord, proclaim it"
  94,1,Have We not expanded for you your breast
  94,2,And eased you of the burden
  94,3,Which weighed so heavily on your back
  94,4,And (have We not) exalted for you your renown
  94,5,"Then, surely, with hardship comes ease"
  94,6,"Surely, with hardship comes ease"
  94,7,"Therefore, when you are free (from one task), resume (another task)"
  94,8,And seek and strive to please your Lord
