  6,119,"And why should you not eat of (the flesh of) that over which God’s Name has been pronounced, seeing that He has clearly spelled out to you what He has made unlawful to you unless you are constrained to it by dire necessity? But, indeed many people lead others astray, driven by their lusts and caprices without any knowledge (from God). Indeed your Lord is He Who knows best those who exceed the bounds"
  6,120,"Abstain from sinning, whether done in public or secret, (and the intentions and attitudes that accompany either). Indeed, those who record sins to their account will be recompensed for what they have earned"

  6,124,"When a Revelation is conveyed to them, they say: \"We will not believe unless we are given the like of what God’s Messengers were given.\" God knows best upon whom to place His Message. Soon will an abasement from God’s Presence befall these criminals and a severe punishment for their scheming"
