quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  52,32,"Do their minds urge them to such (absurd falsehoods), or are they a people (in the habit of being) rebellious and outrageous"
  52,33,"Or do they say: \"He forges it (and then attributes the Qur’an to God)?\" No indeed. Rather, (they make such claims because) they have no will to believe"
  52,34,"(If they really believe such a Book can be forged) then, let them produce a Discourse like it, if they are truthful (in their claims)"
  52,35,"Or were they created without anything being before them (or out of something different than the basic material of all creation, so that they know things others do not), or are they the creators (of themselves, so that they can maintain themselves and are free in their acts)"
  52,36,"Or did they create the heavens and the earth (so that their sovereignty belongs to them)? No indeed. Rather, they have no certain knowledge (about creation, humankind, and the basic facts concerning them)"
  52,37,"Or are the treasures of your Lord at their disposal (so that they provide for creation however they will, and choose whomever they will as Messenger and send down to him whatever Book they will)? Or have they been given authority over them (so that they can prevail upon God to send them a Message and Messenger that suits their interests)"
  52,38,"Or do they have a ladder by which (having climbed to heaven) they overhear (the secrets of heaven, confirming their stand against the Messenger and the Qur’an)? Then let their eavesdropper produce some clear authority (to prove what he claims to have heard)"
  52,39,"Or (do you in your absurdity attribute to Him children, so that) for Him there are daughters (whom you yourselves foolishly disdain), while for you there are sons"
  52,40,Or is it that you (O Messenger) ask them for wage (for conveying God’s Religion to them) so that they are crushed under debt
  52,41,"Or do they have the knowledge of the Unseen (and the Supreme Preserved Tablet) so that they write down the decrees (determining all events, and stipulating a way of life for others to follow)"
  52,42,"Or do they intend a plot (to entrap you so as to defeat your mission)? Yet it is those who disbelieve who are entrapped (in so plotting, because they deny themselves God’s blessings in both worlds)"
  52,43,"Or do you have a deity other than God (to whom, in vain, you look to sustain, and help, and protect you)? All-Glorified is He (in that He is absolutely exalted) above what they associate as partners with Him"
  52,44,"(So obstinate are they in rejecting the truth that) if they saw a piece of the sky falling down (on them), they would say, \"This is (only) a heap of clouds!\" (For they cannot conceive that it may be a punishment for their obstinate denial)"
  52,45,"So, leave them until they meet their Day when they will be struck dead"
  52,46,"The Day when their scheming will avail them nothing, nor will they be helped"
  52,47,"And surely for those who commit the greatest wrong (through unbelief or associating partners with God and resisting the conveying of His Religion), there is another punishment besides that, but most of them do not know"
  52,48,"So wait patiently for your Lord’s judgment, for you are under Our Eyes (under Our care and protection); and glorify your Lord with His praise when you rise up (to pray)"
  52,49,"And in the night-time also glorify Him, and at the retreat of the stars"
