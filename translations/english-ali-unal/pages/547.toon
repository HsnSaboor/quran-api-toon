quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  59,10,"And all those who come after them (and follow in their footsteps) pray: \"O our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers (and sisters) in Religion who have preceded us in faith, and let not our hearts entertain any ill-feeling against any of the believers. O our Lord!

You think of them as one body, but in fact their hearts are at odds with one another: This is because they are a people who do not reason (and come to an understanding of the situations they face)"
  59,15,"Just like those (the Jews of the Banu Qaynuqa‘) who, a short time before them (the Jews of the Banu Nadir), tasted the evil result of their own doings – and (in the Hereafter) for them there is (also) a painful punishment"
  59,16,"(The hypocrites have deceived them) just like Satan, when he says to human, \"Disbelieve (in God)!\" Then when he disbelieves, he says (to human): \"Surely I am quit of you, for surely I fear God, the Lord of the worlds"
