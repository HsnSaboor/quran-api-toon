quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,23,"Do you not consider those who were given a portion from the Book? They are called to the Book of God to judge between them, and then, (after the judgment was given,) a party of them turn away in aversion"
  3,24,"(They venture to do so) because they claim: \"The Fire will not touch us at all, except for a certain number of days.\" (The false beliefs) that they used to invent have deluded them in their religion"
  3,25,"How then will they fare when We gather them all together for a (terrible) Day about (the coming of) which there is no doubt, and when every soul will be repaid in full for what it earned (while in the world), and none will be wronged"
  3,26,"Say: \"O God, absolute Master of all dominion! You give dominion to whom You will, and take away dominion from whom You will, and You exalt and honor whom You will, and abase whom You will; in Your hand is all good; surely You have full power over everything"
  3,27,"You make the night pass into the day and You make the day pass into the night, (and so make each grow longer or shorter); You bring forth the living out the dead, and You bring the dead out of the living, and You provide whomever You will without reckoning"
  3,28,"Let not the believers take the unbelievers for friends, guardians, and councilors in preference to the believers.

And God warns you that you beware of Himself; and to God is the homecoming"
  3,29,"Say (to the believers): \"Whether you keep secret what is in your bosoms or reveal it, God knows it. He knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. God has full power over everything"
