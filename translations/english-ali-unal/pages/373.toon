quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,137,This (what we do) is the pattern of conduct of (all our) predecessors
  26,138,And (so) we are not going to be subject to any punishment
  26,139,"So they denied him and, in consequence, We destroyed them. Surely in that (which took place between Hud and his people) there is a sign (a great, important lesson). Most of them were not believers"
  26,140,"And surely your Lord is indeed the All-Glorious with irresistible might (able to punish whoever goes against His Glory), the All-Compassionate (especially towards His believing servants)"
  26,141,The Thamud denied (Salih and thereby meant to deny all) the Messengers
  26,142,"(Recall) when their brother Salih said to them (by way of timely warning): \"Will you not keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and seek refuge with His protection"
  26,143,"I am indeed a Messenger to you, trustworthy"
  26,144,So keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and obey me
  26,145,I ask of you no wage for that (for conveying God’s Message); my wage is only due from the Lord of the worlds
  26,146,(Do you think) you will be left secure forever in what is here before us
  26,147,Amidst gardens and springs
  26,148,Cornfields and date-palms with heavy bunches (of dates)
  26,149,And that you will (continue to) skillfully hew dwellings out of mountains
  26,150,So keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and obey me
  26,151,And do not follow the commands of those who are wasteful (of God-given faculties) and commit excesses
  26,152,"Those who cause disorder and corruption on the earth, without setting things right"
  26,153,"They responded: \"You are only one of those who are bewitched"
  26,154,"You are but a mortal like us, so produce a sign if you are truthful (in your claim of Messengership)"
  26,155,"(Salih) said: \"This is a she-camel, one day is for her to drink and one day is for you to get water"
  26,156,Do not touch her with evil lest the punishment of an awesome Day should seize you
  26,157,"But (after a time, being unable to put up with it any longer,) they cruelly slaughtered her, and then became regretful"
  26,158,"For the (shocking) punishment seized them. Surely in that (which took place between Salih and his people) there is a sign (a great, important lesson). Most of them were not believers"
  26,159,"And surely your Lord is indeed the All-Glorious with irresistible might (able to punish whoever goes against His Glory), the All-Compassionate (especially towards His believing servants)"
