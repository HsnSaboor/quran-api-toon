quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,When His Lord called out to him in the sacred Valley of Tuwa’
  79,17,"Go to the Pharaoh, for he has exceedingly rebelled"
  79,18,"And say to him: ‘Would you (do you have intent or inclination to) attain to purity"
  79,19,‘Then I will guide you to your Lord so you stand in awe of Him (and behave with humility).’
  79,20,He (went to the Pharaoh and) showed him the great sign (the miracle of the Staff)
  79,21,But the Pharaoh denied (his Messengership) and defied (him)
  79,22,Thereafter he turned away and set out to struggle (with him)
  79,23,"Then he gathered (his men and hosts), and made a proclamation"
  79,24,"Saying: \"I am your Supreme Lord"
  79,25,"And so God seized him and made an example of him, of punishment in the later and the earlier (life)"
  79,26,"For sure, in this there is certainly a lesson for anyone who has awe of and therefore humility before God"
  79,27,(O humankind!) Are you harder to create or is the heaven? He has built it
  79,28,He has raised its vault and put it in an order
  79,29,And He obscured its night and brought out its light of day
  79,30,And after that He has spread out the earth in the egg-shape (for habitability)
  79,31,Out of it He has brought forth its waters and its herbage
  79,32,And the mountains He has set firm
  79,33,(All this) as a means of life for you and your animals
  79,34,But when the great overwhelming event comes
  79,35,On that Day human will recall (and understand) for what he strove
  79,36,And the Blazing Flame will come into view for all who see
  79,37,"And so, whoever rebelled (against God)"
  79,38,And preferred the life of this world
  79,39,The Blazing Flame will be his (final) refuge
  79,40,"But as for him who lived in awe of his Lord, being ever conscious of His seeing him and of the standing before Him (in the Hereafter), and held back his carnal soul from lusts and caprices"
  79,41,Surely Paradise will be his (final) refuge
  79,42,"They ask you (O Messenger) about the Last Hour: \"When will it come to anchor"
  79,43,But how could you have knowledge about its time
  79,44,With your Lord alone rests (the exact knowledge) of its term
  79,45,You are only a warner to those who are in awe of it
  79,46,"It will be, on the Day they see it, as if they had remained (in the world) but for the afternoon (of a day) or its morning"
