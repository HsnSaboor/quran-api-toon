quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  62,9,"O you who believe! When the call is made for the Prayer on Friday, then move promptly to the remembrance of God (by listening to the sermon and doing the Prayer), and leave off business (and whatever else you may be preoccupied with). This is better for you, if you but knew"
  62,10,"And when the Prayer is done, then disperse in the land and seek (your portion) of God’s bounty, and mention God much (both by doing the Prayer and on other occasions), so that you may prosper (in both worlds)"
  62,11,"Yet (it happened that) when they saw (an opportunity for) business or pastime, they broke away for it and left you standing (while preaching the sermon). Say: \"What is with God is better (for you) than pastimes and business. God is the Best to be sought as provider with the ultimate rank of providing"
  63,1,"When the hypocrites come to you, they say: \"We bear witness that you are indeed God’s Messenger.\" God knows that you are indeed His Messenger, and God bears witness that the hypocrites are certainly lying (they do not believe in the truth of what they say)"
  63,2,"They make their oaths a shelter (to hide their inner unbelief and protect themselves in the Muslim community), and so divert themselves (and seek to bar others) from God’s way. Evil indeed is what they habitually do"
  63,3,"That is because they declared faith but thereafter (inwardly) disbelieved, so a seal has been set on their hearts so that they do not grasp the truth (and cannot recover the ability to reach to it)"
  63,4,"When you see them, their outward form pleases you, and (their posture and speech are attractive and effective so that) you give ear to their words when they speak. (In reality) they are like blocks of wood propped up and (draped over) in striped cloaks. They think (being themselves treacherous) every shout (they hear) to be against them. They are the enemies themselves, so beware of them. May God destroy them (they are liable to destruction by God)! How they are turned away from the truth (and pursue evil purposes)"
