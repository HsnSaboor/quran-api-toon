quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  17,18,"Whoever wishes for only the immediate gains (of this transitory life), We readily grant thereof as much as We please to whomever We will. Thereafter We consign him to Hell, wherein he will roast, disgraced and disowned"
  17,19,"But whoever wishes for the Hereafter and strives for it as it should be striven for, being a believer, then for those (who do so) their striving shall be recognized with thanks and reward"
  17,20,Each do We supply – these ones as well as those ones – out of the free gifts of your Lord (in the world); the gift of your Lord is not confined
  17,21,See how We have made some of them excel others (in worldly gifts and in virtues); yet the Hereafter will certainly be greater in ranks and greater in excellence
  17,22,"Do not set up another deity besides God, or you will be sitting disgraced and forsaken"
  17,23,"Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him alone, and treat parents with the best of kindness.

  17,24,"Lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy, and say: \"My Lord, have mercy on them even as they cared for me in childhood"
  17,25,"Your Lord best knows what is in your souls (in respect of all matters, including what you think of your parents). If you are righteous (in your thoughts and deeds), then surely He is All-Forgiving to those who turn to Him in humble contrition"
  17,26,"And give his due to the relative, as well as the destitute and the wayfarer; and do not squander (your wealth) senselessly"
  17,27,Surely squanderers are ever brothers of satans; and Satan is ever ungrateful to his Lord
