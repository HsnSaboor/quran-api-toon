quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,Prosperous indeed are the believers
  23,2,They are in their Prayer humble and fully submissive (being overwhelmed by the awe and majesty of God)
  23,3,They always turn away from and avoid whatever is vain and frivolous
  23,4,They are in a constant effort to give alms and purify their own selves and wealth
  23,5,"They strictly guard their private parts, and their chastity and modesty"
  23,6,"Save from their spouses or (as a permission for men) those (bondsmaids) whom their right hands possess, for with regard to them they are free from blame"
  23,7,"But whoever seeks beyond that, such are they who exceed the bounds (set by God)"
  23,8,They are faithful and true to their trusts (which either God or society or an individual places in their charge) and to their pledges (between them and God or other persons or society)
  23,9,They are ever mindful guardians of their Prayers (including all the rites of which they are constituted)
  23,10,Those (illustrious ones) are the inheritors
  23,11,Who will inherit the highest floor of Paradise. Therein they will abide forever
  23,12,We created humankind (in the very beginning) from a specially sifted extract of clay
  23,13,Then We have made it into a fertilized ovum in a safe lodging
  23,14,"Then We have created of the fertilized ovum a clot clinging (to the womb wall), and (afterwards in sequence) We have created of the clinging clot a (chew of) lump, and We have created of (a chew of) lump bones, and We have clothed the bones in flesh. Then We have caused it to grow into another creation. So Blessed and Supreme is God, the Creator Who creates everything in the best and most appropriate form and has the ultimate rank of creativity"
