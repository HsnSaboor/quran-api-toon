quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"Who used to ask me, ‘Are you really one of those who confirm the truth (of what the Messenger teaches us about the Last Judgment)"
  37,53,"‘Will we, when we die and have become dust and bones – will we then really be (raised and) put under judgment?’"
  37,54,"He (the speaker) will say: \"Would you like to look (into Hell to see him)"
  37,55,He will look down and see him in the midst of the Blazing Flame
  37,56,"He will say: \"By God, you would nearly have caused me to perish"
  37,57,"Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those arraigned (in the Flame for punishment)"
  37,58,"(Then, turning to his companions, he will say:) \"We are not to experience death any more, are we"
  37,59,"Except the former death (that we experienced in leaving the world), and we are not to be punished"
  37,60,(Then) this is most certainly the supreme triumph
  37,61,"For the like of this, then, let those who will labor (to a goal) labor"
  37,62,Is this what is good as a welcome or the tree of Zaqqum
  37,63,We have made it (that tree) a means of trial and punishment for the wrongdoers (who associate partners with God)
  37,64,It is a tree growing in the heart of the Blazing Flame
  37,65,Its fruits are like the heads of satans
  37,66,"So, most surely, they will eat of it and fill up their bellies with it"
  37,67,"Then, for them will be boiling water (to mix with the zaqqum in their bodies)"
  37,68,"And afterwards, they are bound to return to the Blazing Flame again"
  37,69,Assuredly they found their forefathers on the wrong path
  37,70,"And yet, they rush (after them) in their footsteps"
  37,71,"Indeed, most of those (communities) that lived before them went astray"
  37,72,Though We had sent among them warners (with Our guidance)
  37,73,So see how was the outcome for those who were warned (but paid no heed)
  37,74,"Except God’s servants, endowed with sincerity in faith and practicing the Religion"
  37,75,"And Noah (just such a servant and warner) had called upon Us (for help), and how excellent We are in answering (prayer)"
  37,76,We saved him and (his true followers among) his family and people from the mighty distress
