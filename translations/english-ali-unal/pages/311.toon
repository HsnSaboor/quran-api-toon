quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Have you considered the one who disbelieves in Our Revelations and says (in insolence): \"(Whatever you say, I will continue just as I am, for) I will most certainly be given wealth and children"
  19,78,"Has he gained knowledge of the Unseen, or has he made a (particular, private) covenant with the All-Merciful"
  19,79,No indeed! But We will record what he says and saddle him (with its consequence) as an ever increasing punishment
  19,80,"And We will inherit of him what he says, and he will come to us quite alone (bereft of wealth and children)"
  19,81,They have taken deities apart from God so that they may be (a means of) might and glory for them
  19,82,"No indeed! Those (whom they deified – beings such as angels, jinn, Prophets, saints, and heroes, etc.) will deny their worship of them and turn against them as adversaries (on Judgment Day)"
  19,83,"Do you not see that We send the satans upon the unbelievers (because of their unbelief), and they impel them (towards sin and every kind of evil) with strong impulsion"
  19,84,"So be in no haste against them (so that their days and their persecutions of you might end sooner), for We but number for them a certain (fixed) number (of days, the time allotted for their respite)"
  19,85,"A Day (will come) when We will gather the God-revering, pious ones as honored guests of the All-Merciful (in Paradise)"
  19,86,And drive the disbelieving criminals to Hell like thirsty cattle
  19,87,"(Those who have taken deities so that they may intercede with God on their behalf should know that) none will have a right of intercession except such as have a covenant with the All-Merciful (by virtue of the quality of their faith and worship, and their nearness to Him)"
  19,88,"As it is, some say: \"The All-Merciful has taken to Himself a child"
  19,89,Assuredly you have (in such an assertion) brought forth something monstrous –
  19,90,"The heavens are all but rent, and the earth split asunder, and the mountains fall down in ruins –"
  19,91,That they ascribe to the All-Merciful a child
  19,92,It is not for the All-Merciful to take to Himself a child
  19,93,There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes to the All-Merciful as a servant
  19,94,"Most certainly He knows and registers them, and has numbered them exactly, (having appointed for every being a particular service or duty, and determined for each a life-span and provision)"
  19,95,"And every one of them will appear before Him on the Day of Resurrection, quite alone (bereft of all worldly things, children and family, friends and helpers)"
