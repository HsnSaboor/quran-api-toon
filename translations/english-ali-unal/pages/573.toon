quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,"‘And among us are some who have wholly submitted to God, just as there are among us some who have deviated into disobedience to God. Whoever has submitted to God wholly, then such have sought and attained to right guidance (in belief and action)"
  72,15,"‘But as for those who have deviated into disobedience to God, they have become firewood for Hell.’"
  72,16,"If they (humankind and jinn) followed the (Right) Road (of Islam, without deviation), We would certainly grant them water (and provision) in abundance"
  72,17,"We try them in that (which We grant them). Whoever turns away from his Lord’s Reminder (His Book of instruction), He will drive him into an ever-growing punishment (enveloping him in its severity)"
  72,18,"All places of worship (and all parts of the body with which one prostrates ) are for God, and all worship is due to Him alone, so do not worship anyone along with God"
  72,19,"Yet, when God’s servant rises to pray, they (the polytheists) are all but upon him in swarms (with loud, derisive shouting to prevent his recitation of the Qur’an being heard)"
  72,20,"Say: \"I worship only my Lord and do not associate anyone as partner with Him"
  72,21,"Say: \"It is not in my power to cause you harm or bring you good by guiding you (to the Straight Path)"
  72,22,"Say: \"No one could ever protect me from God (if I were to disobey Him), nor could I find a refuge except in Him"
  72,23,"(What I can and must do is) only to convey (the truth) from God and His Messages.\" And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger, for him there is surely the fire of Hell, to abide therein forever"
  72,24,"(Let them continue to see you as few in number and weak and therefore belittle you, but) when they see what (the Fire) which they are promised, they will come to know who is really weaker in helpers and fewer in number"
  72,25,"Say: \"I do not know whether (your coming face to face with) what you are promised is near, or whether my Lord sets for it a distant term"
  72,26,"(He alone is) the Knower of the Unseen (what lies beyond human perception), and He does not disclose His Unseen to anyone"
  72,27,Except to a Messenger whom He has chosen (and is well-pleased with – He informs him of the Unseen as much as He wills –); and He dispatches a watchful guard before him (between him and his audience) and a watchful guard behind him (between him and the origin of the Revelation)
  72,28,"In order that He may establish that they (the Messengers) have for certain conveyed the messages of their Lord. He encompasses all that they have (of the Revelation), and He has recorded everything one by one"
