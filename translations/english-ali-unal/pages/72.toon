quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,166,"What befell you on the day when the two hosts met (in battle) was by God’s leave, and that He might mark out the (true) believers"
  3,167,"And that He might mark out those who acted in hypocrisy: when they were told, \"Come and fight in God’s cause, or defend yourselves (actively, in order to keep the enemy outside the city),\" they said: \"If we but knew there would be fighting, we would indeed follow you.\" They that day were nearer to unbelief than to faith, uttering with their mouths what was not in their hearts. God knows very well what they were concealing"
  3,168,"They who, having themselves held back (from fighting), say of their (slain) brothers, \"Had they but paid heed to us, they would not have been killed.\" Say (to them, O Messenger): \"Avert, then, death from yourselves, if you are truthful (in your claim)"
  3,169,"Do not think at all of those killed in God’s cause as dead. Rather, they are alive; with their Lord they have their sustenance"
  3,170,"Rejoicing in what God has granted them out of His bounty, and joyful in the glad tidings for those left behind who have not yet joined them, that (in the event of martyrdom) they will have no fear, nor will they grieve"
  3,171,"They are joyful in the glad tidings of God’s blessing and bounty (that He has prepared for the martyrs), and in (the promise) that God never leaves to waste the reward of the believers"
  3,172,"Those who responded to the call of God and the Messenger after the hurt had befallen them – for all those of them who persevered in doing good, aware that God was seeing them, and acted in reverence for God and piety, there is a tremendous reward"
  3,173,"Those to whom some people said: \"Look, those people have gathered against you, therefore be fearful of them.\" But it increased them only in faith, and they responded: \"God is sufficient for us; how excellent a Guardian He is"
