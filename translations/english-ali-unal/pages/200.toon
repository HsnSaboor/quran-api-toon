quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,80,"Whether you (O Messenger) pray for their forgiveness or do not pray for their forgiveness, even if you pray for their forgiveness seventy times, God will not forgive them. That is because they disbelieve in God and His Messenger. God will not guide the transgressing people"
  9,81,"Those who were left behind in opposition to God’s Messenger rejoiced at staying at home, and abhorred striving with their wealth and persons in God’s cause. And they said: \"Do not go forth to war in this heat.\" Say (O Messenger): \"The fire of Hell is fiercer in heat.\" If only they had been able to ponder and penetrate the essence of matters to grasp the truth"
  9,82,"So let them laugh little and weep much, in recompense for what they have been earning"
  9,83,"If God brings you back (from the Campaign) and a party of them ask your leave to go forth to war with you, say to them: \"Never will you go forth with me any more, nor will you fight an enemy in my company. You were content to stay at home on that first occasion, so continue to stay at home with those who are (naturally) bound to remain behind"
  9,84,"And never do the funeral Prayer over any of them who dies, nor stand by his grave to pray for him. They surely disbelieved in God and His Messenger and died transgressors"
  9,85,Let neither their wealth nor their children impress you; God only wills thereby to punish them in this world and that their souls should depart while they are unbelievers
  9,86,"(Indeed they are unbelievers, and never want to go forth to war in God’s cause.) Whenever a surah is sent down (calling them): \"Believe in God and strive in God’s cause in the company of His Messenger,\" (even) those of them who are well able (to go to war) ask you to excuse them, saying: \"Leave us to be with those who are to stay at home"
