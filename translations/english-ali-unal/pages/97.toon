quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"No good is there in most of their secret counsels except for him who exhorts to a deed of charity, or kind equitable dealings and honest affairs, or setting things right between people. Whoever does that seeking God’s good pleasure, We will grant to him a tremendous reward"
  4,115,"While whoever cuts himself off from the Messenger after the guidance (to what is truest and best in thought, belief, and conduct) has become clear to him, and follows a way other than that of the believers (for whom it is impossible to agree unanimously on a way that leads to error), We leave him (to himself) on the way he has turned to, and land him in Hell to roast there: how evil a destination to arrive at"
  4,116,Indeed God does not forgive that partners be associated with Him; less than that He forgives to whomever He wills (whomever He has guided to repentance and righteousness as a result of his choosing repentance and righteousness by his free will). Whoever associates partners with God has indeed strayed far away (from the Straight Path)
  4,117,"In His stead, they invoke female deities – (in so doing) they in fact invoke none but a haughty, rebellious Satan"
  4,118,"One who is accursed by God (excluded from His mercy). Once he said: \"Of Your servants I will surely take a share to be assigned to me (by their following me)"
  4,119,"I will surely lead them astray and surely engross them in vain desires (superstitious fancies and false conceptions); and I will surely command them, and they will surely slit the ears of cattle (to mark them out as meant for their idols and as forbidden to themselves to eat, thus making a lawful thing unlawful); and also I will surely command them and they will surely alter God’s creation.\" Whoever takes Satan for a confidant and guardian instead of God has indeed suffered a manifest loss"
  4,120,"(In reality, however, Satan has no authority over people against God.) He makes promises to them and fills them with vain desires (superstitious fancies and false conceptions), and what he promises them is nothing but delusion"
  4,121,"Such (as those deluded by Satan): their shelter is Hell, and they will find no way to escape from it"
