quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,84,"(God) said: \"(Whatever I do and command is) the truth itself, and the truth I speak"
  38,85,"I will most certainly fill Hell with you (and your kind), and those (of humankind) who follow you, all together"
  38,86,"Say (O Messenger): \"I ask of you no wage for this (conveying the Qur’an to you), and I am not of those who claim to be what they are really not and make fabrications of their own"
  38,87,This (Qur’an) is only a Reminder (with guidance and admonishment) for all conscious beings
  38,88,You will most certainly come to know what it informs of after a time (as appointed for you)
  39,1,"(This is) the Book being sent down in parts from God, the All-Glorious with irresistible might, the All-Wise"
  39,2,"We have sent down to you the Book with the truth (embodying it, and with nothing false in it), so worship God, sincere in your faith in Him and practicing the Religion purely for His sake"
  39,3,"Beware! it is to God alone that all sincere faith, worship, and obedience are due. Yet, those who take, apart from Him, others (angels, jinn, or humans) for guardians and confidants (to entrust their affairs to) say: \"We worship them for no other reason than they may bring us nearer to God.\" God will judge between them (between those who worship and obey God exclusively and those who associate partners with Him) concerning all on which they differ. God does not guide anyone who is a determined liar and ingrate"
  39,4,"Had God willed to take to Himself a child, He could certainly have chosen whatever He willed out of all that He has created. All-Glorified is He (in that He is exalted above having any children). He is God, the One, the All-Overwhelming (with absolute sway over all that exists)"
  39,5,"He has created the heavens and the earth with truth (meaningfully and for definite purpose, and on solid foundations of truth). He wraps the night around the day and He wraps the day around the night (until one covers the other completely). And He has made the sun and the moon subservient (to His command), each running its course for a term appointed (by Him). Be aware! He is the All-Glorious with irresistible might (able to punish those who oppose Him), the All-Forgiving (Who forgives those who turn to Him in repentance)"
