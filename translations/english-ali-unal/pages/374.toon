quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,The people of Lot denied (Lot and thereby meant to deny all) the Messengers
  26,161,"(Recall) when their brother Lot said to them (by way of timely warning): \"Will you not keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and seek refuge with His protection"
  26,162,"I am indeed a Messenger to you, trustworthy"
  26,163,So keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and obey me
  26,164,I ask of you no wage for that (for conveying God’s Message); my wage is only due from the Lord of the worlds
  26,165,"What! Do you, of all the world’s people, approach men (with lust)"
  26,166,"And leave aside what your Lord has created (and made lawful) for you in your wives? No, indeed! you are a people exceeding all bounds (of decency)"
  26,167,"They responded: \"If you do not desist, you will most certainly be cast out (from our land)"
  26,168,"(Lot) said: \"I am indeed one who abhors your practice"
  26,169,"(And he prayed:) \"My Lord! Save me and my family from (the consequences of) what they have been doing"
  26,170,"So We saved him and his family, all of them"
  26,171,"Except an old woman, who was among those who stayed behind (and were destroyed)"
  26,172,Then We annihilated the others
  26,173,We poured upon them a (destructive) rain (of stones). How evil was the rain of those who had been warned
  26,174,"Surely in that (which took place between Lot and his people) there is a sign (a great, important lesson). Most of them were not believers"
  26,175,"And surely your Lord is indeed the All-Glorious with irresistible might (able to punish whoever goes against His Glory), the All-Compassionate (especially towards His believing servants)"

  26,178,"I am indeed a Messenger to you, trustworthy"

  26,182,"And weigh with the straighta true, accurate balance"
  26,183,"Do not wrong people by depriving them of what is rightfully theirs, and do not go about acting wickedly in the land, causing disorder and corruption"
