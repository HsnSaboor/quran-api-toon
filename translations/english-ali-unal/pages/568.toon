quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,"And so, he will have none to befriend him this Day"
  69,36,Nor any food except foul pus
  69,37,None eat it except the sinful (those guilty of denying God or associating partners with Him and oppressing people)
  69,38,No indeed! I swear by all that you can see
  69,39,And all that you cannot see
  69,40,"It surely is the speech (conveyed to you by) an illustrious, noble Messenger"
  69,41,And not a poet’s speech (composed in a poet’s mind). How little is what you believe! (It is so limited by the poverty of your souls and hearts)
  69,42,Nor is it a soothsayer’s speech (pretending to foretell events). How little it is that you reflect and be mindful! (It is so limited by the poverty of your minds)
  69,43,(No indeed!) It is a Revelation being sent down in parts from the Lord of the worlds
  69,44,If he (the Messenger) had dared to fabricate some false sayings in attribution to Us
  69,45,We would certainly have seized him with might
  69,46,Thereafter We would certainly have cut his life-vein
  69,47,Then not one from among you could have shielded and saved him from Us
  69,48,"And it is a sure Reminder (bringing hope and guidance) for the God-revering, pious"
  69,49,We are most certainly aware that among you are some who deny (it)
  69,50,It will surely be a bitter regret for the unbelievers
  69,51,And this (the whole Qur’an) is surely certain truth
  69,52,"So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Supreme"
  70,1,A questioner (in mocking denial of the Day of Resurrection) has asked about the punishment certain to befall
  70,2,(And prepared for) the unbelievers; none can ward it off (from them)
  70,3,"(It is) from God, Whose are the stairs of ascent"
  70,4,"The angels and the Spirit ascend to Him (thereby), in a day the measure of which is fifty thousand years (of your normal worldly years)"
  70,5,So (O Messenger) endure (their insolence) with becoming patience
  70,6,They see it (the punishment) as far off (beyond their reason and perception)
  70,7,But We see it as (certain to come and) near at hand
  70,8,The Day when the sky will be like molten metal
  70,9,And the mountains will be like multi-colored tufts of wool
  70,10,And no loyal friend will ask after his friend
