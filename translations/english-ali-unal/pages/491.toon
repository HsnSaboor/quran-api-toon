quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  43,23,"In just that way, We never sent a warner to a township before you but those of its people who had been lost in the pursuit of pleasures without scruples reacted, saying: \"We have found our forefathers following a religion, and we certainly follow in their footsteps"
  43,24,"He (who was sent to warn them) said: \"What! even though I have come to you with better guidance than what you have found your forefathers following?\" They said: \"Surely we are unbelievers in that with which you have been sent"
  43,25,"So then We took Our retribution on them. So look: how was the outcome for those who denied (God’s Messengers)"
  43,26,"And (remember) when Abraham (who rejected following the way of his forefathers blindly) said to his father and his people: \"I am indeed free of all that you worship"
  43,27,"I worship only Him Who has originated me with a particular nature, and He will guide me (to the truth and to eternal happiness)"
  43,28,"And He left it as a Word to endure among those who would come after him, so that they may return (from worshipping false deities to the worship of One God)"
  43,29,"Indeed I have allowed these (people of Makkah), as I had allowed their forefathers, to enjoy their lives until when the truth and a Messenger came to them, making the truth clear, (and embodying it in every element of his life and character)"
  43,30,"But now the truth has come to them, they say: \"This is sorcery and we are unbelievers in it"
  43,31,"They also say: \"If only this Qur’an had been sent down on a man of leading position of the two (chief) cities"
  43,32,"Is it they who distribute the mercy of your Lord (so that they may appoint whom they wish as Messenger to receive the Book)? (Moreover, how do they presume to value some above others only because of their wealth or status, when) it is also We Who distribute their means of livelihood among them in the life of this world, and raise some of them above others in degree, so that they may avail themselves of one another’s help? But your Lord’s mercy (in particular Prophethood) is better than what they amass (in this life)"
  43,33,"And were it not that all people would become one community (around unbelief), We might well have provided for everyone who disbelieves in the All-Merciful roofs of silver for their houses, and (silver) stairways on which to go up"
