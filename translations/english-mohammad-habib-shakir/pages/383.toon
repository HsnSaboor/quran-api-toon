quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  27,64,"Or, Who originates the creation, then reproduces it and Who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth. Is there a god With Allah? Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful"
  27,65,"Say: No one in the heavens and the earth knows the unseen but Allah; and they do not know when they shall be raised"
  27,66,"Nay, their knowledge respecting the hereafter is slight and hasty; nay, they are in doubt about it; nay, they are quite blind to it"
  27,67,"And those who disbelieve say: What! when we have become dust and our fathers (too), shall we certainly be brought forth"
  27,68,"We have certainly been promised this, we and our fathers before; these are naught but stories of the ancients"
  27,69,"Say: Travel in the earth, then see how was the end of the guilty"
  27,70,And grieve not for them and be not distressed because of what they plan
  27,71,"And they say: When will this threat come to pass, if you are truthful"
  27,72,"Say: Maybe there may have drawn near to you somewhat of that which you seek to hasten on"
  27,73,"And surely your Lord is the Lord of grace to men, but most of them are not grateful"
  27,74,And most surely your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they manifest
  27,75,And there is nothing concealed in the heaven and the earth but it is in a clear book
  27,76,Surely this Quran declares to the children of Israel most of what they differ in
