  26,112,"He said: And what knowledge have I of what they do"
  26,113,"Their account is only with my Lord, if you could perceive"
  26,114,And I am not going to drive away the believers
  26,115,I am naught but a plain warner
  26,116,"They said: If you desist not, O Nuh, you shall most certainly be of those stoned to death"
  26,117,"He said: My Lord! Surely my people give me the lie"
  26,118,"Therefore judge Thou between me and them with a (just) judgment, and deliver me and those who are with me of the believers"
  26,119,So We delivered him and those with him in the laden ark
  26,120,Then We drowned the rest afterwards
  26,121,"Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe"

  26,123,Ad gave the lie to the apostles
  26,124,"When their brother Hud said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)"
  26,125,Surely I am a faithful apostle to you
  26,126,Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me
  26,127,And I do not ask you any reward for it; surely my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds
  26,128,Do you build on every height a monument? Vain is it that you do
  26,129,And you make strong fortresses that perhaps you may
  26,130,And when you lay hands (on men) you lay hands (like) tyrants
  26,131,So guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me
  26,132,And be careful of (your duty to) Him Who has given you abundance of what you know
  26,133,He has given you abundance of cattle and children
  26,134,And gardens and fountains
  26,135,Surely I fear for you the chastisement of a grievous day
  26,136,"They said: It is the same to us whether you admonish or are not one of the admonishers"
