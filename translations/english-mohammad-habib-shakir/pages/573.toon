quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,"And that some of us are those who submit, and some of us are the deviators; so whoever submits, these aim at the right way"
  72,15,"And as to the deviators, they are fuel of hell"
  72,16,"And that if they should keep to the (right) way, We would certainly give them to drink of abundant water"
  72,17,"So that We might try them with respect to it; and whoever turns aside from the reminder of his Lord, He will make him enter into an afflicting chastisement"
  72,18,"And that the mosques are Allah's, therefore call not upon any one with Allah"
  72,19,"And that when the servant of Allah stood up calling upon Him, they wellnigh crowded him (to death)"
  72,20,"Say: I only call upon my Lord, and I do not associate any one with Him"
  72,21,"Say: I do not control for you evil or good"
  72,22,"Say: Surely no one can protect me against Allah, nor can I find besides Him any place of refuge"
  72,23,(It is) only a delivering (of communications) from Allah and His messages; and whoever disobeys Allah and His Apostle surely he shall have the fire of hell to abide therein for a long time
  72,24,"Until when they see what they are threatened with, then shall they know who is weaker in helpers and fewer in number"
  72,25,"Say: I do not know whether that with which you are threatened be nigh or whether my Lord will appoint for it a term"
  72,26,The Knower of the unseen! so He does not reveal His secrets to any
  72,27,Except to him whom He chooses as an apostle; for surely He makes a guard to march before him and after him
  72,28,"So that He may know that they have truly delivered the messages of their Lord, and He encompasses what is with them and He records the number of all things"
