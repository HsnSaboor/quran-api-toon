quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,"What is the matter with you, how is it that you judge"
  37,155,Will you not then mind
  37,156,Or have you a clear authority
  37,157,"Then bring your book, if you are truthful"
  37,158,And they assert a relationship between Him and the jinn; and certainly the jinn do know that they shall surely be brought up
  37,159,Glory be to Allah (for freedom) from what they describe
  37,160,"But not so the servants of Allah, the purified ones"
  37,161,So surely you and what you worship
  37,162,Not against Him can you cause (any) to fall into trial
  37,163,Save him who will go to hell
  37,164,And there is none of us but has an assigned place
  37,165,And most surely we are they who draw themselves out in ranks
  37,166,And we are most surely they who declare the glory (of Allah)
  37,167,And surely they used to say
  37,168,Had we a reminder from those of yore
  37,169,We would certainly have been the servants of Allah-- the purified ones
  37,170,"But (now) they disbelieve in it, so they will come to know"
  37,171,"And certainly Our word has already gone forth in respect of Our servants, the apostles"
  37,172,Most surely they shall be the assisted ones
  37,173,And most surely Our host alone shall be the victorious ones
  37,174,Therefore turn away from them till a time
  37,175,"And (then) see them, so they too shall see"
  37,176,What! would they then hasten on Our chastisement
  37,177,"But when it shall descend in their court, evil shall then be the morning of the warned ones"
  37,178,And turn away from them till a time
  37,179,"And (then) see, for they too shall see"
  37,180,"Glory be to your Lord, the Lord of Honor, above what they describe"
  37,181,And peace be on the apostles
  37,182,"And all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds"
