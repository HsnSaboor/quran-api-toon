quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  21,102,"They will not hear its faintest sound, and they shall abide in that which their souls long for"
  21,103,"The great fearful event shall not grieve them, and the angels shall meet them: This is your day which you were promised"
  21,104,"On the day when We will roll up heaven like the rolling up of the scroll for writings, as We originated the first creation, (so) We shall reproduce it; a promise (binding on Us); surely We will bring it about"
  21,105,"And certainly We wrote in the Book after the reminder that (as for) the land, My righteous servants shall inherit it"
  21,106,Most surely in this is a message to a people who serve
  21,107,And We have not sent you but as a mercy to the worlds
  21,108,"Say: It is only revealed to me that your Allah is one Allah; will you then submit"
  21,109,"But if they turn back, say: I have given you warning in fairness and I do not know whether what you are threatened with is near or far"
  21,110,Surely He knows what is spoken openly and He knows what you hide
  21,111,And I do not know if this may be a trial for you and a provision till a time
  21,112,"He said: O my Lord! judge Thou with truth; and our Lord is the Beneficent Allah, Whose help is sought against what you ascribe (to Him)"
