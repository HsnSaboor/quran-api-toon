quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,The people of Lut gave the lie to the apostles
  26,161,"When their brother Lut said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)"
  26,162,Surely I am a faithful apostle to you
  26,163,Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me
  26,164,And I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds
  26,165,What! do you come to the males from among the creatures
  26,166,"And leave what your Lord has created for you of your wives? Nay, you are a people exceeding limits"
  26,167,"They said: If you desist not, O Lut! you shall surely be of those who are expelled"
  26,168,"He said: Surely I am of those who utterly abhor your doing"
  26,169,My Lord! deliver me and my followers from what they do
  26,170,So We delivered him and his followers all
  26,171,"Except an old woman, among those who remained behind"
  26,172,Then We utterly destroyed the others
  26,173,"And We rained down upon them a rain, and evil was the rain on those warned"
  26,174,"Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe"
  26,175,"And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,176,The dwellers of the thicket gave the lie to the apostles
  26,177,"When Shu'aib said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)"
  26,178,Surely I am a faithful apostle to you
  26,179,Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me
  26,180,"And I do not ask you any reward for it, my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds"
  26,181,Give a full measure and be not of those who diminish
  26,182,And weigh (things) with a right balance
  26,183,"And do not wrong men of their things, and do not act corruptly in the earth, making mischief"
