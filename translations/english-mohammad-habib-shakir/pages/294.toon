  18,6,"Then maybe you will kill yourself with grief, sorrowing after them, if they do not believe in this announcement"
  18,7,"Surely We have made whatever is on the earth an embellishment for it, so that We may try them (as to) which of them is best in works"
  18,8,And most surely We will make what is on it bare ground without herbage
  18,9,"Or, do you think that the Fellows of the Cave and the Inscription were of Our wonderful signs"
  18,10,"When the youths sought refuge in the cave, they said: Our Lord! grant us mercy from Thee, and provide for us a right course in our affair"
  18,11,So We prevented them from hearing in the cave for a number of years
  18,12,Then We raised them up that We might know which of the two parties was best able to compute the time for which they remained

  18,14,"And We strengthened their hearts with patience, when they stood up and said: Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth; we will by no means call upon any god besides Him, for then indeed we should have said an extravagant thing"
  18,15,These our people have taken gods besides Him; why do they not produce any clear authority in their support? Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah
