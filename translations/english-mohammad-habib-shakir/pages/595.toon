quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,I swear by the sun and its brilliance
  91,2,And the moon when it follows the sun
  91,3,And the day when it shows it
  91,4,And the night when it draws a veil over it
  91,5,And the heaven and Him Who made it
  91,6,And the earth and Him Who extended it
  91,7,And the soul and Him Who made it perfect
  91,8,Then He inspired it to understand what is right and wrong for it
  91,9,He will indeed be successful who purifies it
  91,10,And he will indeed fail who corrupts it
  91,11,Samood gave the lie (to the truth) in their inordinacy
  91,12,When the most unfortunate of them broke forth with
  91,13,"So Allah's apostle said to them (Leave alone) Allah's she-camel, and (give) her (to) drink"
  91,14,"But they called him a liar and slaughtered her, therefore their Lord crushed them for their sin and levelled them (with the ground)"
  91,15,And He fears not its consequence
  92,1,I swear by the night when it draws a veil
  92,2,And the day when it shines in brightness
  92,3,And the creating of the male and the female
  92,4,Your striving is most surely (directed to) various (ends)
  92,5,Then as for him who gives away and guards (against evil)
  92,6,And accepts the best
  92,7,We will facilitate for him the easy end
  92,8,And as for him who is niggardly and considers himself free from need (of Allah)
  92,9,And rejects the best
  92,10,We will facilitate for him the difficult end
  92,11,And his wealth will not avail him when he perishes
  92,12,Surely Ours is it to show the way
  92,13,And most surely Ours is the hereafter and the former
  92,14,Therefore I warn you of the fire that flames
