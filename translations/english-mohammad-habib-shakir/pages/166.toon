quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  7,131,"But when good befell them they said: This is due to us; and when evil afflicted them, they attributed it to the ill-luck of Musa and those with him; surely their evil fortune is only from Allah but most of them do not know"
  7,132,"And they said: Whatever sign you may bring to us to charm us with it-- we will not believe in you"
  7,133,"Therefore We sent upon them widespread death, and the locusts and the lice and the frog and the blood, clear signs; but they behaved haughtily and they were a guilty people"
  7,134,"And when the plague fell upon them, they said: O Musa! pray for us to your Lord as He has promised with you, if you remove the plague from us, we will certainly believe in you and we will certainly send away with you the children of Israel"
  7,135,But when We removed the plague from them till a term which they should attain lo! they broke (the promise)
  7,136,Therefore We inflicted retribution on them and drowned them in the sea because they rejected Our signs and were heedless of them
  7,137,And We made the people who were deemed weak to inherit the eastern lands and the western ones which We had blessed; and the good word of your Lord was fulfilled in the children of Israel because they bore up (sufferings) patiently; and We utterly destroyed what Firon and his people had wrought and what they built
