quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,17,"Bear patiently what they say, and remember Our servant Dawood, the possessor of power; surely he was frequent in returning (to Allah)"
  38,18,Surely We made the mountains to sing the glory (of Allah) in unison with him at the evening and the sunrise
  38,19,And the birds gathered together; all joined in singing with him
  38,20,And We strengthened his kingdom and We gave him wisdom and a clear judgment
  38,21,"And has there come to you the story of the litigants, when they made an entry into the private chamber by ascending over the walls"
  38,22,"When they entered in upon Dawood and he was frightened at them, they said: Fear not; two litigants, of whom one has acted wrongfully towards the other, therefore decide between us with justice, and do not act unjustly, and guide us to the right way"
  38,23,"Surely this is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes and I have a single ewe; but he said: Make it over to me, and he has prevailed against me in discourse"
  38,24,"He said: Surely he has been unjust to you in demanding your ewe (to add) to his own ewes; and most surely most of the partners act wrongfully towards one another, save those who believe and do good, and very few are they; and Dawood was sure that We had tried him, so he sought the protection of his Lord and he fell down bowing and turned time after time (to Him)"
  38,25,"Therefore We rectified for him this, and most surely he had a nearness to Us and an excellent resort"
  38,26,"o Dawood! surely We have made you a ruler in the land; so judge between men with justice and do not follow desire, lest it should lead you astray from the path of Allah; (as for) those who go astray from the path of Allah, they shall surely have a severe punishment because they forgot the day of reckoning"
