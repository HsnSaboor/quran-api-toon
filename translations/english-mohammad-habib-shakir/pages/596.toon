quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,None shall enter it but the most unhappy
  92,16,Who gives the lie (to the truth) and turns (his) back
  92,17,And away from it shall be kept the one who guards most (against evil)
  92,18,"Who gives away his wealth, purifying himself"
  92,19,And no one has with him any boon for which he should be rewarded
  92,20,"Except the seeking of the pleasure of his Lord, the Most High"
  92,21,And he shall soon be well-pleased
  93,1,I swear by the early hours of the day
  93,2,And the night when it covers with darkness
  93,3,"Your Lord has not forsaken you, nor has He become displeased"
  93,4,And surely what comes after is better for you than that which has gone before
  93,5,And soon will your Lord give you so that you shall be well pleased
  93,6,Did He not find you an orphan and give you shelter
  93,7,"And find you lost (that is, unrecognized by men) and guide (them to you)"
  93,8,And find you in want and make you to be free from want
  93,9,"Therefore, as for the orphan, do not oppress (him)"
  93,10,"And as for him who asks, do not chide (him)"
  93,11,"And as for the favor of your Lord, do announce (it)"
  94,1,Have We not expanded for you your breast
  94,2,And taken off from you your burden
  94,3,Which pressed heavily upon your back
  94,4,And exalted for you your esteem
  94,5,Surely with difficulty is ease
  94,6,With difficulty is surely ease
  94,7,"So when you are free, nominate"
  94,8,And make your Lord your exclusive object
