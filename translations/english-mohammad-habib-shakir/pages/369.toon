quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,40,"Haply we may follow the magicians, if they are the vanquishers"
  26,41,"And when the magicians came, they said to Firon: Shall we get a reward if we are the vanquishers"
  26,42,"He said: Yes, and surely you will then be of those who are made near"
  26,43,"Musa said to them: Cast what you are going to cast"
  26,44,"So they cast down their cords and their rods and said: By Firon's power, we shall most surely be victorious"
  26,45,Then Musa cast down his staff and lo! it swallowed up the lies they told
  26,46,And the magicians were thrown down prostrate
  26,47,"They said: We believe in the Lord of the worlds"
  26,48,The Lord of Musa and Haroun
  26,49,"Said he: You believe in him before I give you permission; most surely he is the chief of you who taught you the magic, so you shall know: certainly I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and certainly I will crucify you all"
  26,50,"They said: No harm; surely to our Lord we go back"
  26,51,Surely we hope that our Lord will forgive us our wrongs because we are the first of the believers
  26,52,"And We revealed to Musa, saying: Go away with My servants travelling by night, surely you will be pursued"
  26,53,So Firon sent heralds into the cities
  26,54,Most surely these are a small company
  26,55,And most surely they have enraged us
  26,56,And most surely we are a vigilant multitude
  26,57,So We turned them out of gardens and springs
  26,58,And treasures and goodly dwellings
  26,59,Even so. And We gave them as a heritage to the children of Israel
  26,60,Then they pursued them at sunrise
