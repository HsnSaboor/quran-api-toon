  75,21,And neglect the hereafter
  75,22,(Some) faces on that day shall be bright
  75,23,Looking to their Lord
  75,24,And (other) faces on that day shall be gloomy
  75,25,Knowing that there will be made to befall them some great calamity
  75,26,Nay! When it comes up to the throat
  75,27,"And it is said: Who will be a magician"
  75,28,And he is sure that it is the (hour of) parting
  75,29,And affliction is combined with affliction
  75,30,To your Lord on that day shall be the driving
  75,31,"So he did not accept the truth, nor did he pray"
  75,32,But called the truth a lie and turned back

  76,2,"Surely We have created man from a small life-germ uniting (itself): We mean to try him, so We have made him hearing, seeing"
  76,3,"Surely We have shown him the way: he may be thankful or unthankful"
  76,4,Surely We have prepared for the unbelievers chains and shackles and a burning fire
  76,5,Surely the righteous shall drink of a cup the admixture of which is camphor
