quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,And ordain for me a goodly mention among posterity
  26,85,And make me of the heirs of the garden of bliss
  26,86,"And forgive my father, for surely he is of those who have gone astray"
  26,87,And disgrace me not on the day when they are raised
  26,88,"The day on which property will not avail, nor sons"
  26,89,Except him who comes to Allah with a heart free (from evil)
  26,90,And the garden shall be brought near for those who guard (against evil)
  26,91,And the hell shall be made manifest to the erring ones
  26,92,"And it shall be said to them: Where are those that you used to worship"
  26,93,Besides Allah? Can they help you or yet help themselves
  26,94,"So they shall be thrown down into it, they and the erring ones"
  26,95,"And the hosts of the Shaitan, all"
  26,96,They shall say while they contend therein
  26,97,By Allah! we were certainly in manifest error
  26,98,When we made you equal to the Lord of the worlds
  26,99,And none but the guilty led us astray
  26,100,So we have no intercessors
  26,101,Nor a true friend
  26,102,"But if we could but once return, we would be of the believers"
  26,103,"Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe"
  26,104,"And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,105,The people of Nuh rejected the apostles
  26,106,"When their brother Nuh said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)"
  26,107,Surely I am a faithful apostle to you
  26,108,Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me
  26,109,And I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds
  26,110,So guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me
  26,111,"They said: Shall we believe in you while the meanest follow you"
