quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,(Though) they shall be made to see each other. The guilty one would fain redeem himself from the chastisement of that day by (sacrificing) his children
  70,12,And his wife and his brother
  70,13,And the nearest of his kinsfolk who gave him shelter
  70,14,"And all those that are in the earth, (wishing) then (that) this might deliver him"
  70,15,By no means! Surely it is a flaming fire
  70,16,Dragging by the head
  70,17,It shall claim him who turned and fled (from truth)
  70,18,And amasses (wealth) then shuts it up
  70,19,Surely man is created of a hasty temperament
  70,20,Being greatly grieved when evil afflicts him
  70,21,And niggardly when good befalls him
  70,22,Except those who pray
  70,23,Those who are constant at their prayer
  70,24,And those in whose wealth there is a fixed portion
  70,25,For him who begs and for him who is denied (good)
  70,26,And those who accept the truth of the judgment day
  70,27,And those who are fearful of the chastisement of their Lord
  70,28,Surely the chastisement of their Lord is (a thing) not to be felt secure of
  70,29,And those who guard their private parts
  70,30,Except in the case of their wives or those whom their right hands possess-- for these surely are not to be blamed
  70,31,"But he who seeks to go beyond this, these it is that go beyond the limits"
  70,32,And those who are faithful to their trusts and their covenant
  70,33,And those who are upright in their testimonies
  70,34,And those who keep a guard on their prayer
  70,35,"Those shall be in gardens, honored"
  70,36,But what is the matter with those who disbelieve that they hasten on around you
  70,37,"On the right hand and on the left, in sundry parties"
  70,38,Does every man of them desire that he should be made to enter the garden of bliss
  70,39,By no means! Surely We have created them of what they know
