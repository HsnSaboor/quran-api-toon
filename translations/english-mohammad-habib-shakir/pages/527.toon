quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,Most surely they who do not believe in the hereafter name the angels with female names
  53,28,"And they have no knowledge of it; they do not follow anything but conjecture, and surely conjecture does not avail against the truth at all"
  53,29,Therefore turn aside from him who turns his back upon Our reminder and does not desire anything but this world's life
  53,30,That is their goal of knowledge; surely your Lord knows best him who goes astray from His path and He knows best him who follows the right direction
  53,31,"And Allah's is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, that He may reward those who do evil according to what they do, and (that) He may reward those who do good with goodness"
  53,32,Those who keep aloof from the great sins and the indecencies but the passing idea; surely your Lord is liberal in forgiving. He knows you best when He brings you forth from the earth and when you are embryos in the wombs of your mothers; therefore do not attribute purity to your souls; He knows him best who guards (against evil)
  53,33,Have you then seen him who turns his back
  53,34,And gives a little and (then) withholds
  53,35,Has he the knowledge of the unseen so that he can see
  53,36,"Or, has he not been informed of what is in the scriptures of Musa"
  53,37,And (of) Ibrahim who fulfilled (the commandments)
  53,38,That no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another
  53,39,And that man shall have nothing but what he strives for
  53,40,And that his striving shall soon be seen
  53,41,Then shall he be rewarded for it with the fullest reward
  53,42,And that to your Lord is the goal
  53,43,And that He it is Who makes (men) laugh and makes (them) weep
  53,44,And that He it is Who causes death and gives life
