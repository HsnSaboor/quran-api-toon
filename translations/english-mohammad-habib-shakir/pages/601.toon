quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,I swear by the time
  103,2,Most surely man is in loss
  103,3,"Except those who believe and do good, and enjoin on each other truth, and enjoin on each other patience"
  104,1,"Woe to every slanderer, defamer"
  104,2,Who amasses wealth and considers it a provision (against mishap)
  104,3,He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal
  104,4,Nay! he shall most certainly be hurled into the crushing disaster
  104,5,And what will make you realize what the crushing disaster is
  104,6,It is the fire kindled by Allah
  104,7,Which rises above the hearts
  104,8,Surely it shall be closed over upon them
  104,9,In extended columns
  105,1,Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the possessors of the elephant
  105,2,Did He not cause their war to end in confusion
  105,3,And send down (to prey) upon them birds in flocks
  105,4,Casting against them stones of baked clay
  105,5,So He rendered them like straw eaten up
