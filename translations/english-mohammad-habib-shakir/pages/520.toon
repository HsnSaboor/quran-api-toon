quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,"And how many a generation did We destroy before them who were mightier in prowess than they, so they went about and about in the lands. Is there a place of refuge"
  50,37,Most surely there is a reminder in this for him who has a heart or he gives ear and is a witness
  50,38,And certainly We created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six periods and there touched Us not any fatigue
  50,39,"Therefore be patient of what they say, and sing the praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before the setting"
  50,40,And glorify Him in the night and after the prayers
  50,41,And listen on the day when the crier shall cry from a near place
  50,42,The day when they shall hear the cry in truth; that is the day of coming forth
  50,43,"Surely We give life and cause to die, and to Us is the eventual coming"
  50,44,"The day on which the earth shall cleave asunder under them, they will make haste; that is a gathering together easy to Us"
  50,45,"We know best what they say, and you are not one to compel them; therefore remind him by means of the Quran who fears My threat"
  51,1,I swear by the wind that scatters far and wide
  51,2,Then those clouds bearing the load (of minute things in space)
  51,3,Then those (ships) that glide easily
  51,4,Then those (angels who) distribute blessings by Our command
  51,5,What you are threatened with is most surely true
  51,6,And the judgment must most surely come about
