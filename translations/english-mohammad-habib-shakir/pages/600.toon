quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,And what is in the breasts is made apparent
  100,11,Most surely their Lord that day shall be fully aware of them
  101,1,The terrible calamity
  101,2,What is the terrible calamity
  101,3,And what will make you comprehend what the terrible calamity is
  101,4,The day on which men shall be as scattered moths
  101,5,And the mountains shall be as loosened wool
  101,6,Then as for him whose measure of good deeds is heavy
  101,7,He shall live a pleasant life
  101,8,And as for him whose measure of good deeds is light
  101,9,His abode shall be the abyss
  101,10,And what will make you know what it is
  101,11,A burning fire
  102,1,Abundance diverts you
  102,2,Until you come to the graves
  102,3,Nay! you shall soon know
  102,4,Nay! Nay! you shall soon know
  102,5,Nay! if you had known with a certain knowledge
  102,6,You should most certainly have seen the hell
  102,7,Then you shall most certainly see it with the eye of certainty
  102,8,Then on that day you shall most certainly be questioned about the boons
