quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,Surely he reflected and guessed
  74,19,But may he be cursed how he plotted
  74,20,"Again, may he be cursed how he plotted"
  74,21,Then he looked
  74,22,Then he frowned and scowled
  74,23,Then he turned back and was big with pride
  74,24,"Then he said: This is naught but enchantment, narrated (from others)"
  74,25,This is naught but the word of a mortal
  74,26,I will cast him into hell
  74,27,And what will make you realize what hell is
  74,28,It leaves naught nor does it spare aught
  74,29,It scorches the mortal
  74,30,Over it are nineteen
  74,31,"And We have not made the wardens of the fire others than angels, and We have not made their number but as a trial for those who disbelieve, that those who have been given the book may be certain and those who believe may increase in faith, and those who have been given the book and the believers may not doubt, and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the unbelievers may say: What does Allah mean by this parable? Thus does Allah make err whom He pleases, and He guides whom He pleases, and none knows the hosts of your Lord but He Himself; and this is naught but a reminder to the mortals"
  74,32,Nay; I swear by the moon
  74,33,And the night when it departs
  74,34,And the daybreak when it shines
  74,35,Surely it (hell) is one of the gravest (misfortunes)
  74,36,A warning to mortals
  74,37,To him among you who wishes to go forward or remain behind
  74,38,Every soul is held in pledge for what it earns
  74,39,Except the people of the right hand
  74,40,"In gardens, they shall ask each other"
  74,41,About the guilty
  74,42,What has brought you into hell
  74,43,"They shall say: We were not of those who prayed"
  74,44,And we used not to feed the poor
  74,45,And we used to enter into vain discourse with those who entered into vain discourses
  74,46,And we used to call the day of judgment a lie
  74,47,Till death overtook us
