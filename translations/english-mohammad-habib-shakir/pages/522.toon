  51,31,"He said: What is your affair then, O apostles"
  51,32,"They said: Surely we are sent to a guilty people"
  51,33,That we may send down upon them stone of clay
  51,34,Sent forth from your Lord for the extravagant
  51,35,Then We brought forth such as were therein of the believers
  51,36,But We did not find therein save a (single) house of those who submitted (the Muslims)
  51,37,And We left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment
  51,38,"And in Musa: When We sent him to Firon with clear authority"
  51,39,"But he turned away with his forces and said: A magician or a mad man"
  51,40,So We seized him and his hosts and hurled them into the sea and he was blamable
  51,41,"And in Ad: When We sent upon them the destructive wind"
  51,42,"It did not leave aught on which it blew, but it made it like ashes"
  51,43,"And in Samood: When it was said to them: Enjoy yourselves for a while"
  51,44,"But they revolted against the commandment of their Lord, so the rumbling overtook them while they saw"
  51,45,"So they were not able to rise up, nor could they defend themselves"
  51,46,"And the people of Nuh before, surely they were a transgressing people"
  51,47,"And the heaven, We raised it high with power, and most surely We are the makers of things ample"
  51,48,"And the earth, We have made it a wide extent; how well have We then spread (it) out"
  51,49,And of everything We have created pairs that you may be mindful
  51,50,"Therefore fly to Allah, surely I am a plain warner to you from Him"
  51,51,"And do not set up with Allah another god: surely I am a plain warner to you from Him"
