quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  19,65,"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, so serve Him and be patient in His service. Do you know any one equal to Him"
  19,66,"And says man: What! when I am dead shall I truly be brought forth alive"
  19,67,"Does not man remember that We created him before, when he was nothing"
  19,68,"So by your Lord! We will most certainly gather them together and the Shaitans, then shall We certainly cause them to be present round hell on their knees"
  19,69,Then We will most certainly draw forth from every sect of them him who is most exorbitantly rebellious against the Beneficent Allah
  19,70,Again We do certainly know best those who deserve most to be burned therein
  19,71,And there is not one of you but shall come to it; this is an unavoidable decree of your Lord
  19,72,"And We will deliver those who guarded (against evil), and We will leave the unjust therein on their knees"
  19,73,"And when Our clear communications are recited to them, those who disbelieve say to those who believe: Which of the two parties is best in abiding and best in assembly"
  19,74,And how many of the generations have We destroyed before them who were better in respect of goods and outward appearance
  19,75,"Say: As for him who remains in error, the Beneficent Allah will surely prolong his length of days, until they see what they were threatened with, either the punishment or the hour; then they shall know who is in more evil plight and weaker in forces"
  19,76,And Allah increases in guidance those who go aright; and ever-abiding good works are with your Lord best in recompense and best in yielding fruit
