quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,I swear by the heaven and the comer by night
  86,2,And what will make you know what the comer by night is
  86,3,The star of piercing brightness
  86,4,There is not a soul but over it is a keeper
  86,5,So let man consider of what he is created
  86,6,He is created of water pouring forth
  86,7,Coming from between the back and the ribs
  86,8,Most surely He is able to return him (to life)
  86,9,On the day when hidden things shall be made manifest
  86,10,He shall have neither strength nor helper
  86,11,I swear by the raingiving heavens
  86,12,And the earth splitting (with plants)
  86,13,Most surely it is a decisive word
  86,14,And it is no joke
  86,15,Surely they will make a scheme
  86,16,And I (too) will make a scheme
  86,17,"So grant the unbelievers a respite: let them alone for a while"
  87,1,"Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High"
  87,2,"Who creates, then makes complete"
  87,3,"And Who makes (things) according to a measure, then guides (them to their goal)"
  87,4,And Who brings forth herbage
  87,5,"Then makes it dried up, dust-colored"
  87,6,We will make you recite so you shall not forget
  87,7,"Except what Allah pleases, surely He knows the manifest, and what is hidden"
  87,8,And We will make your way smooth to a state of ease
  87,9,"Therefore do remind, surely reminding does profit"
  87,10,He who fears will mind
  87,11,And the most unfortunate one will avoid it
  87,12,Who shall enter the great fire
  87,13,Then therein he shall neither live nor die
  87,14,He indeed shall be successful who purifies himself
  87,15,And magnifies the name of his Lord and prays
