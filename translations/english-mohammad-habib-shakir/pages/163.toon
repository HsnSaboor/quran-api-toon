quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  7,96,"And if the people of the towns had believed and guarded (against evil) We would certainly have opened up for them blessings from the heaven and the earth, but they rejected, so We overtook them for what they had earned"
  7,97,What! do the people of the towns then feel secure from Our punishment coming to them by night while they sleep
  7,98,What! do the people of the towns feel secure from Our punishment coming to them in the morning while they play
  7,99,What! do they then feel secure from Allah's plan? But none feels secure from Allah's plan except the people who shall perish
  7,100,Is it not clear to those who inherit the earth after its (former) residents that if We please We would afflict them on account of their faults and set a seal on their hearts so they would not hear
  7,101,"These towns-- We relate to you some of their stories, and certainly their apostles came to them with clear arguments, but they would not believe in what they rejected at first; thus does Allah set a seal over the hearts of the unbelievers"
  7,102,"And We did not find in most of them any (faithfulness to) covenant, and We found most of them to be certainly transgressors"
  7,103,"Then we raised after them Musa with Our communications to Firon and his chiefs, but they disbelieved in them; consider then what was the end of the mischief makers"
  7,104,"And Musa said: O Firon! surely I am an apostle from the Lord of the worlds"
