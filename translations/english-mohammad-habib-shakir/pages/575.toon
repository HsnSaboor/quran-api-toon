quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Surely your Lord knows that you pass in prayer nearly two-thirds of the night, and (sometimes) half of it, and (sometimes) a third of it, and (also) a party of those with you; and Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you are not able to do it, so He has turned to you (mercifully), therefore read what is easy of the Quran. He knows that there must be among you sick, and others who travel in the land seeking of the bounty of Allah, and others who fight in Allah's way, therefore read as much of it as is easy (to you), and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and offer to Allah a goodly gift, and whatever of good you send on beforehand for yourselves, you will find it with Allah; that is best and greatest in reward; and ask forgiveness of Allah; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  74,1,O you who are clothed
  74,2,Arise and warn
  74,3,And your Lord do magnify
  74,4,And your garments do purify
  74,5,And uncleanness do shun
  74,6,And bestow not favors that you may receive again with increase
  74,7,"And for the sake of your Lord, be patient"
  74,8,For when the trumpet is sounded
  74,9,"That, at that time, shall be a difficult day"
  74,10,"For the unbelievers, anything but easy"
  74,11,Leave Me and him whom I created alone
  74,12,And give him vast riches
  74,13,And sons dwelling in his presence
  74,14,And I adjusted affairs for him adjustably
  74,15,And yet he desires that I should add more
  74,16,By no means! surely he offers opposition to Our communications
  74,17,I will make a distressing punishment overtake him
