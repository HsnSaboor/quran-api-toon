quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,28,"And if you turn away from them to seek mercy from your Lord, which you hope for, speak to them a gentle word"
  17,29,"And do not make your hand to be shackled to your neck nor stretch it forth to the utmost (limit) of its stretching forth, lest you should (afterwards) sit down blamed, stripped off"
  17,30,"Surely your Lord makes plentiful the means of subsistence for whom He pleases and He straitens (them); surely He is ever Aware of, Seeing, His servants"
  17,31,And do not kill your children for fear of poverty; We give them sustenance and yourselves (too); surely to kill them is a great wrong
  17,32,And go not nigh to fornication; surely it is an indecency and an evil way
  17,33,"And do not kill any one whom Allah has forbidden, except for a just cause, and whoever is slain unjustly, We have indeed given to his heir authority, so let him not exceed the just limits in slaying; surely he is aided"
  17,34,And draw not near to the property of the orphan except in a goodly way till he attains his maturity and fulfill the promise; surely (every) promise shall be questioned about
  17,35,"And give full measure when you measure out, and weigh with a true balance; this is fair and better in the end"
  17,36,"And follow not that of which you have not the knowledge; surely the hearing and the sight and the heart, all of these, shall be questioned about that"
  17,37,"And do not go about in the land exultingly, for you cannot cut through the earth nor reach the mountains in height"
  17,38,All this-- the evil of it-- is hateful in the sight of your Lord
