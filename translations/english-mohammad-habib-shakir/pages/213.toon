quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"Say: Is there any one among your associates who can bring into existence the creation in the first instance, then reproduce it? Say: Allah brings the creation into existence, then He reproduces it; how are you then turned away"
  10,35,"Say: Is there any of your associates who guides to the truth? Say: Allah guides to the truth. Is He then Who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed, or he who himself does not go aright unless he is guided? What then is the matter with you; how do you judge"
  10,36,And most of them do not follow (anything) but conjecture; surely conjecture will not avail aught against the truth; surely Allah is cognizant of what they do
  10,37,"And this Quran is not such as could be forged by those besides Allah, but it is a verification of that which is before it and a clear explanation of the book, there is no doubt in it, from the Lord of the worlds"
  10,38,"Or do they say: He has forged it? Say: Then bring a chapter like this and invite whom you can besides Allah, if you are truthful"
  10,39,"Nay, they reject that of which they have no comprehensive knowledge, and the final sequel of it has not yet come to them; even thus did those before them reject (the truth); see then what was the end of the unjust"
  10,40,"And of them is he who believes in it, and of them is he who does not believe in it, and your Lord best knows the mischief-makers"
  10,41,"And if they call you a liar, say: My work is for me and your work for you; you are clear of what I do and I am clear of what you do"
  10,42,"And there are those of them who hear you, but can you make the deaf to hear though they will not understand"
