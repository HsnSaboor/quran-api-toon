quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,Of what do they ask one another
  78,2,About the great event
  78,3,About which they differ
  78,4,Nay! they shall soon come to know
  78,5,Nay! Nay! they shall soon know
  78,6,Have We not made the earth an even expanse
  78,7,And the mountains as projections (thereon)
  78,8,And We created you in pairs
  78,9,And We made your sleep to be rest (to you)
  78,10,And We made the night to be a covering
  78,11,And We made the day for seeking livelihood
  78,12,And We made above you seven strong ones
  78,13,And We made a shining lamp
  78,14,And We send down from the clouds water pouring forth abundantly
  78,15,That We may bring forth thereby corn and herbs
  78,16,And gardens dense and luxuriant
  78,17,Surely the day of decision is (a day) appointed
  78,18,The day on which the trumpet shall be blown so you shall come forth in hosts
  78,19,And the heaven shall be opened so that it shall be all openings
  78,20,And the mountains shall be moved off so that they shall remain a mere semblance
  78,21,Surely hell lies in wait
  78,22,A place of resort for the inordinate
  78,23,Living therein for ages
  78,24,They shall not taste therein cool nor drink
  78,25,But boiling and intensely cold water
  78,26,Requital corresponding
  78,27,Surely they feared not the account
  78,28,"And called Our communications a lie, giving the lie (to the truth)"
  78,29,And We have recorded everything in a book
  78,30,So taste! for We will not add to you aught but chastisement
