quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  16,43,And We did not send before you any but men to whom We sent revelation-- so ask the followers of the Reminder if you do not know
  16,44,"With clear arguments and scriptures; and We have revealed to you the Reminder that you may make clear to men what has been revealed to them, and that haply they may reflect"
  16,45,Do they then who plan evil (deeds) feel secure (of this) that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that punishment may not overtake them from whence they do not perceive
  16,46,"Or that He may not seize them in the course of their journeys, then shall they not escape"
  16,47,"Or that He may not seize them by causing them to suffer gradual loss, for your Lord is most surely Compassionate, Merciful"
  16,48,"Do they not consider every thing that Allah has created? Its (very) shadows return from right and left, making obeisance to Allah while they are in utter abasement"
  16,49,"And whatever creature that is in the heavens and that is in the earth makes obeisance to Allah (only), and the angels (too) and they do not show pride"
  16,50,They fear their Lord above them and do what they are commanded
  16,51,"And Allah has said: Take not two gods, He is only one Allah; so of Me alone should you be afraid"
  16,52,"And whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His, and to Him should obedience be (rendered) constantly; will you then guard against other than (the punishment of) Allah"
  16,53,"And whatever favor is (bestowed) on you it is from Allah; then when evil afflicts you, to Him do you cry for aid"
  16,54,"Yet when He removes the evil from you, lo! a party of you associate others with their Lord"
