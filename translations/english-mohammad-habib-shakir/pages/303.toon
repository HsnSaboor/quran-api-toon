  18,84,Surely We established him in the land and granted him means of access to every thing
  18,85,So he followed a course
  18,86,"Until when he reached the place where the sun set, he found it going down into a black sea, and found by it a people. We said: O Zulqarnain! either give them a chastisement or do them a benefit"
  18,87,"He said: As to him who is unjust, we will chastise him, then shall he be returned to his Lord, and He will chastise him with an exemplary chastisement"
  18,88,"And as for him who believes and does good, he shall have goodly reward, and We will speak to him an easy word of Our command"
  18,89,Then he followed (another) course
  18,90,"Until when he reached the land of the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people to whom We had given no shelter from It"
  18,91,Even so! and We had a full knowledge of what he had
  18,92,Then he followed (another) course
  18,93,"Until when he reached (a place) between the two mountains, he found on that side of them a people who could hardly understand a word"
  18,94,"They said: O Zulqarnain! surely Gog and Magog make mischief in the land. Shall we then pay you a tribute on condition that you should raise a barrier between us and them"
  18,95,"He said: That in which my Lord has established me is better, therefore you only help me with workers, I will make a fortified barrier between you and them"
  18,96,"Bring me blocks of iron; until when he had filled up the space between the two mountain sides, he said: Blow, until when he had made it (as) fire, he said: Bring me molten brass which I may pour over it"
  18,97,So they were not able to scale it nor could they make a hole in it
