quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,170,"And when it is said to them, Follow what Allah has revealed, they say: Nay! we follow what we found our fathers upon. What! and though their fathers had no sense at all, nor did they follow the right way"
  2,171,"And the parable of those who disbelieve is as the parable of one who calls out to that which hears no more than a call and a cry; deaf, dumb (and) blind, so they do not understand"
  2,172,"O you who believe! eat of the good things that We have provided you with, and give thanks to Allah if Him it is that you serve"
  2,173,"He has only forbidden you what dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that over which any other (name) than (that of) Allah has been invoked; but whoever is driven to necessity, not desiring, nor exceeding the limit, no sin shall be upon him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  2,174,"Surely those who conceal any part of the Book that Allah has revealed and take for it a small price, they eat nothing but fire into their bellies, and Allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful chastisement"
  2,175,These are they who buy error for the right direction and chastisement for forgiveness; how bold they are to encounter fire
  2,176,This is because Allah has revealed the Book with the truth; and surely those who go against the Book are in a great opposition
