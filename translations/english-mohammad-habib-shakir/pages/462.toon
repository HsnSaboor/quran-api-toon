quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  39,32,Who is then more unjust than he who utters a lie against Allah and (he who) gives the lie to the truth when it comes to him; is there not in hell an abode for the unbelievers
  39,33,And he who brings the truth and (he who) accepts it as the truth-- these are they that guard (against evil)
  39,34,They shall have with their Lord what they please; that is the reward of the doers of good
  39,35,So that Allah will do away with the worst of what they did and give them their reward for the best of what they do
  39,36,"Is not Allah sufficient for His servant? And they seek to frighten you with those besides Him; and whomsoever Allah makes err, there is no guide for him"
  39,37,"And whom Allah guides, there is none that can lead him astray; is not Allah Mighty, the Lord of retribution"
  39,38,"And should you ask them, Who created the heavens and the earth? They would most certainly say: Allah. Say: Have you then considered that what you call upon besides Allah, would they, if Allah desire to afflict me with harm, be the removers of His harm, or (would they), if Allah desire to show me mercy, be the withholders of His mercy? Say: Allah is sufficient for me; on Him do the reliant rely"
  39,39,"Say: O my people! work in your place, surely I am a worker, so you will come to know"
  39,40,Who it is to whom there shall come a punishment which will disgrace him and to whom will be due a lasting punishment
