quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,109,And whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is Allah's; and to Allah all things return
  3,110,You are the best of the nations raised up for (the benefit of) men; you enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and believe in Allah; and if the followers of the Book had believed it would have been better for them; of them (some) are believers and most of them are transgressors
  3,111,"They shall by no means harm you but with a slight evil; and if they fight with you they shall turn (their) backs to you, then shall they not be helped"
  3,112,"Abasement is made to cleave to them wherever they are found, except under a covenant with Allah and a covenant with men, and they have become deserving of wrath from Allah, and humiliation is made to cleave to them; this is because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah and slew the prophets unjustly; this is because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits"
  3,113,They are not all alike; of the followers of the Book there is an upright party; they recite Allah's communications in the nighttime and they adore (Him)
  3,114,"They believe in Allah and the last day, and they enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and they strive with one another in hastening to good deeds, and those are among the good"
  3,115,"And whatever good they do, they shall not be denied it, and Allah knows those who guard (against evil)"
