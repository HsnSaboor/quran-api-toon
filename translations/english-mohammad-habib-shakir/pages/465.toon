quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  39,57,"Or it should say: Had Allah guided me, I would certainly have been of those who guard (against evil)"
  39,58,"Or it should say when it sees the punishment: Were there only a returning for me, I should be of the doers of good"
  39,59,"Aye! My communications came to you, but you rejected them, and you were proud and you were one of the unbelievers"
  39,60,And on the day of resurrection you shall see those who lied against Allah; their faces shall be blackened. Is there not in hell an abode for the proud
  39,61,"And Allah shall deliver those who guard (against evil) with their achievement; evil shall not touch them, nor shall they grieve"
  39,62,Allah is the Creator of every thing and He has charge over every thing
  39,63,"His are the treasures of the heavens and the earth; and (as for) those who disbelieve in the communications of Allah, these it is that are the losers"
  39,64,"Say: What! Do you then bid me serve others than Allah, O ignorant men"
  39,65,"And certainly, it has been revealed to you and to those before you: Surely if you associate (with Allah), your work would certainly come to naught and you would certainly be of the losers"
  39,66,Nay! but serve Allah alone and be of the thankful
  39,67,"And they have not honored Allah with the honor that is due to Him; and the whole earth shall be in His grip on the day of resurrection and the heavens rolled up in His right hand; glory be to Him, and may He be exalted above what they associate (with Him)"
