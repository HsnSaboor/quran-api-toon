quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,"When his Lord called upon him in the holy valley, twice"
  79,17,"Go to Firon, surely he has become inordinate"
  79,18,"Then say: Have you (a desire) to purify yourself"
  79,19,And I will guide you to your Lord so that you should fear
  79,20,So he showed him the mighty sign
  79,21,But he rejected (the truth) and disobeyed
  79,22,Then he went back hastily
  79,23,Then he gathered (men) and called out
  79,24,"Then he said: I am your lord, the most high"
  79,25,So Allah seized him with the punishment of the hereafter and the former life
  79,26,Most surely there is in this a lesson to him who fears
  79,27,Are you the harder to create or the heaven? He made it
  79,28,"He raised high its height, then put it into a right good state"
  79,29,And He made dark its night and brought out its light
  79,30,"And the earth, He expanded it after that"
  79,31,He brought forth from it its water and its pasturage
  79,32,"And the mountains, He made them firm"
  79,33,A provision for you and for your cattle
  79,34,But when the great predominating calamity comes
  79,35,The day on which man shall recollect what he strove after
  79,36,And the hell shall be made manifest to him who sees
  79,37,Then as for him who is inordinate
  79,38,And prefers the life of this world
  79,39,"Then surely the hell, that is the abode"
  79,40,And as for him who fears to stand in the presence of his Lord and forbids the soul from low desires
  79,41,Then surely the garden-- that is the abode
  79,42,"They ask you about the hour, when it will come"
  79,43,About what! You are one to remind of it
  79,44,To your Lord is the goal of it
  79,45,You are only a warner to him who would fear it
  79,46,"On the day that they see it, it will be as though they had not tarried but the latter part of a day or the early part of it"
