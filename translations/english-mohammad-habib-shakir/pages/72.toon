  3,166,"And what befell you on the day when the two armies met (at Ohud) was with Allah's knowledge, and that He might know the believers"
  3,167,"And that He might know the hypocrites; and it was said to them: Come, fight in Allah's way, or defend yourselves. They said: If we knew fighting, we would certainly have followed you.

  3,168,"Those who said of their brethren whilst they (themselves) held back: Had they obeyed us, they would not have been killed. Say: Then avert death from yourselves if you speak the truth"

  3,170,"Rejoicing in what Allah has given them out of His grace and they rejoice for the sake of those who, (being left) behind them, have not yet joined them, that they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve"
  3,171,"They rejoice on account of favor from Allah and (His) grace, and that Allah will not waste the reward of the believers"
  3,172,"(As for) those who responded (at Ohud) to the call of Allah and the Apostle after the wound had befallen them, those among them who do good (to others) and guard (against evil) shall have a great reward"
  3,173,"Those to whom the people said: Surely men have gathered against you, therefore fear them, but this increased their faith, and they said: Allah is sufficient for us and most excellent is the Protector"
