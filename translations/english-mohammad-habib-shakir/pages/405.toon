quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,6,"(This is) Allah's promise! Allah will not fail His promise, but most people do not know"
  30,7,"They know the outward of this world's life, but of the hereafter they are absolutely heedless"
  30,8,"Do they not reflect within themselves: Allah did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them two but with truth, and (for) an appointed term? And most surely most of the people are deniers of the meeting of their Lord"
  30,9,"Have they not travelled in the earth and seen how was the end of those before them? They were stronger than these in prowess, and dug up the earth, and built on it in greater abundance than these have built on it, and there came to them their apostles with clear arguments; so it was not beseeming for Allah that He should deal with them unjustly, but they dealt unjustly with their own souls"
  30,10,"Then evil was the end of those who did evil, because they | rejected the communications of Allah and used to mock them"
  30,11,"Allah originates the creation, then reproduces it, then to Him you shall be brought back"
  30,12,And at the time when the hour shall come the guilty shall be in despair
  30,13,"And they shall not have any intercessors from among their gods they have joined with Allah, and they shall be deniers of their associate-gods"
  30,14,"And at the time when the hour shall come, at that time they shall become separated one from the other"
  30,15,"Then as to those who believed and did good, they shall be made happy in a garden"
