quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,41,"And, O my people! how is it that I call you to salvation and you call me to the fire"
  40,42,"You call on me that I should disbelieve in Allah and associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, and I call you to the Mighty, the most Forgiving"
  40,43,"No doubt that what you call me to has no title to be called to in this world, nor in the hereafter, and that our turning back is to Allah, and that the extravagant are the inmates of the fire"
  40,44,"So you shall remember what I say to you, and I entrust my affair to Allah, Surely Allah sees the servants"
  40,45,"So Allah protected him from the evil (consequences) of what they planned, and the most evil punishment overtook Firon's people"
  40,46,"The fire; they shall be brought before it (every) morning and evening and on the day when the hour shall come to pass: Make Firon's people enter the severest chastisement"
  40,47,"And when they shall contend one with another in the fire, then the weak shall say to those who were proud: Surely we were your followers; will you then avert from us a portion of the fire"
  40,48,"Those who were proud shall say: Surely we are all in it: surely Allah has judged between the servants"
  40,49,"And those who are in the fire shall say to the keepers of hell: Call upon your Lord that He may lighten to us one day of the punishment"
