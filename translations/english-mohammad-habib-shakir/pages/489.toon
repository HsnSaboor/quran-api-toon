quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  42,52,"And thus did We reveal to you an inspired book by Our command. You did not know what the Book was, nor (what) the faith (was), but We made it a light, guiding thereby whom We please of Our servants; and most surely you show the way to the right path"
  42,53,"The path of Allah, Whose is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth; now surely to Allah do all affairs eventually come"
  43,1,Ha Mim
  43,2,I swear by the Book that makes things clear
  43,3,Surely We have made it an Arabic Quran that you may understand
  43,4,"And surely it is in the original of the Book with Us, truly elevated, full of wisdom"
  43,5,What! shall We then turn away the reminder from you altogether because you are an extravagant people
  43,6,And how many a prophet have We sent among the ancients
  43,7,And there came not to them a prophet but they mocked at him
  43,8,"Then We destroyed those who were stronger than these in prowess, and the case of the ancients has gone before"
  43,9,"And if you should ask them, Who created the heavens and the earth? they would most certainly say: The Mighty, the Knowing One, has created them"
  43,10,"He Who made the earth a resting-place for you, and made in it ways for you that you may go aright"
