quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,So the intercession of intercessors shall not avail them
  74,49,"What is then the matter with them, that they turn away from the admonition"
  74,50,As if they were asses taking fright
  74,51,That had fled from a lion
  74,52,Nay; every one of them desires that he may be given pages spread out
  74,53,Nay! but they do not fear the hereafter
  74,54,Nay! it is surely an admonition
  74,55,So whoever pleases may mind it
  74,56,And they will not mind unless Allah please. He is worthy to be feared and worthy to forgive
  75,1,Nay! I swear by the day of resurrection
  75,2,Nay! I swear by the self-accusing soul
  75,3,Does man think that We shall not gather his bones
  75,4,Yea! We are able to make complete his very fingertips
  75,5,Nay! man desires to give the lie to what is before him
  75,6,"He asks: When is the day of resurrection"
  75,7,So when the sight becomes dazed
  75,8,And the moon becomes dark
  75,9,And the sun and the moon are brought together
  75,10,"Man shall say on that day: Whither to fly to"
  75,11,By no means! there shall be no place of refuge
  75,12,With your Lord alone shall on that day be the place of rest
  75,13,Man shall on that day be informed of what he sent before and (what he) put off
  75,14,Nay! man is evidence against himself
  75,15,Though he puts forth his excuses
  75,16,Do not move your tongue with it to make haste with it
  75,17,Surely on Us (devolves) the collecting of it and the reciting of it
  75,18,"Therefore when We have recited it, follow its recitation"
  75,19,Again on Us (devolves) the explaining of it
