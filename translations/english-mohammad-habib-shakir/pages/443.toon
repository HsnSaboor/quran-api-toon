quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,And a sign to them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship
  36,42,"And We have created for them the like of it, what they will ride on"
  36,43,"And if We please, We can drown them, then there shall be no succorer for them, nor shall they be rescued"
  36,44,But (by) mercy from Us and for enjoyment till a time
  36,45,"And when it is said to them: Guard against what is before you and what is behind you, that mercy may be had on you"
  36,46,And there comes not to them a communication of the communications of their Lord but they turn aside from it
  36,47,"And when it is said to them: Spend out of what Allah has given you, those who disbelieve say to those who believe: Shall we feed him whom, if Allah please, He could feed? You are in naught but clear error"
  36,48,"And they say: When will this threat come to pass, if you are truthful"
  36,49,They wait not for aught but a single cry which will overtake them while they yet contend with one another
  36,50,"So they shall not be able to make a bequest, nor shall they return to their families"
  36,51,"And the trumpet shall be blown, when lo! from their graves they shall hasten on to their Lord"
  36,52,"They shall say: O woe to us! who has raised us up from our sleeping-place? This is what the Beneficent Allah promised and the apostles told the truth"
  36,53,"There would be naught but a single cry, when lo! they shall all be brought before Us"
  36,54,So this day no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; and you shall not be rewarded aught but that which you did
