quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  67,13,And conceal your word or manifest it; surely He is Cognizant of what is in the hearts
  67,14,"Does He not know, Who created? And He is the Knower of the subtleties, the Aware"
  67,15,"He it is Who made the earth smooth for you, therefore go about in the spacious sides thereof, and eat of His sustenance, and to Him is the return after death"
  67,16,Are you secure of those in the heaven that He should not make the earth to swallow you up? Then lo! it shall be in a state of commotion
  67,17,Or are you secure of those in the heaven that He should not send down upon you a punishment? Then shall you know how was My warning
  67,18,"And certainly those before them rejected (the truth), then how was My disapproval"
  67,19,Have they not seen the birds above them expanding (their wings) and contracting (them)? What is it that withholds them save the Beneficent Allah? Surely He sees everything
  67,20,Or who is it that will be a host for you to assist you besides the Beneficent Allah? The unbelievers are only in deception
  67,21,Or who is it that will give you sustenance if He should withhold His sustenance? Nay! they persist in disdain and aversion
  67,22,What! is he who goes prone upon his face better guided or he who walks upright upon a straight path
  67,23,"Say: He it is Who brought you into being and made for you the ears and the eyes and the hearts: little is it that you give thanks"
  67,24,"Say: He it is Who multiplied you in the earth and to Him you shall be gathered"
  67,25,"And they say: When shall this threat be (executed) if you are truthful"
  67,26,"Say: The knowledge (thereof is only with Allah and I am only a plain warner)"
