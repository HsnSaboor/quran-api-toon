quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  76,26,"And during part of the night adore Him, and give glory to Him (a) long (part of the) night"
  76,27,Surely these love the transitory and neglect a grievous day before them
  76,28,"We created them and made firm their make, and when We please We will bring in their place the likes of them by a change"
  76,29,"Surely this is a reminder, so whoever pleases takes to his Lord a way"
  76,30,"And you do not please except that Allah please, surely Allah is Knowing, Wise"
  76,31,"He makes whom He pleases to enter into His mercy; and (as for) the unjust, He has prepared for them a painful chastisement"
  77,1,"I swear by the emissary winds, sent one after another (for men's benefit)"
  77,2,By the raging hurricanes
  77,3,Which scatter clouds to their destined places
  77,4,Then separate them one from another
  77,5,Then I swear by the angels who bring down the revelation
  77,6,To clear or to warn
  77,7,Most surely what you are threatened with must come to pass
  77,8,So when the stars are made to lose their light
  77,9,And when the heaven is rent asunder
  77,10,And when the mountains are carried away as dust
  77,11,And when the apostles are gathered at their appointed time
  77,12,To what day is the doom fixed
  77,13,To the day of decision
  77,14,And what will make you comprehend what the day of decision is
  77,15,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,16,Did We not destroy the former generations
  77,17,Then did We follow them up with later ones
  77,18,Even thus shall We deal with the guilty
  77,19,Woe on that day to the rejecters
