quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,1,I swear by those who draw themselves out in ranks
  37,2,Then those who drive away with reproof
  37,3,"Then those who recite, being mindful"
  37,4,Most surely your Allah is One
  37,5,"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and Lord of the easts"
  37,6,"Surely We have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment, the stars"
  37,7,And (there is) a safeguard against every rebellious Shaitan
  37,8,They cannot listen to the exalted assembly and they are thrown at from every side
  37,9,"Being driven off, and for them is a perpetual chastisement"
  37,10,"Except him who snatches off but once, then there follows him a brightly shining flame"
  37,11,Then ask them whether they are stronger in creation or those (others) whom We have created. Surely We created them of firm clay
  37,12,Nay! you wonder while they mock
  37,13,"And when they are reminded, they mind not"
  37,14,And when they see a sign they incite one another to scoff
  37,15,"And they say: This is nothing but clear magic"
  37,16,"What! when we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then certainly be raised"
  37,17,Or our fathers of yore
  37,18,"Say: Aye! and you shall be abject"
  37,19,"So it shall only be a single cry, when lo! they shall see"
  37,20,"And they shall say: O woe to us! this is the day of requital"
  37,21,This is the day of the judgment which you called a lie
  37,22,"Gather together those who were unjust and their associates, and what they used to worship"
  37,23,"Besides Allah, then lead them to the way to hell"
  37,24,"And stop them, for they shall be questioned"
