quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"There is no good in most of their secret counsels except (in his) who enjoins charity or goodness or reconciliation between people; and whoever does this seeking Allah's pleasure, We will give him a mighty reward"
  4,115,"And whoever acts hostilely to the Apostle after that guidance has become manifest to him, and follows other than the way of the believers, We will turn him to that to which he has (himself) turned and make him enter hell; and it is an evil resort"
  4,116,"Surely Allah does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him, and He forgives what is besides this to whom He pleases; and whoever associates anything with Allah, he indeed strays off into a remote error"
  4,117,"They do not call besides Him on anything but idols, and they do not call on anything but a rebellious Shaitan"
  4,118,"Allah has cursed him; and he said: Most certainly I will take of Thy servants an appointed portion"
  4,119,"And most certainly I will lead them astray and excite in them vain desires, and bid them so that they shall slit the ears of the cattle, and most certainly I will bid them so that they shall alter Allah's creation; and whoever takes the Shaitan for a guardian rather than Allah he indeed shall suffer a manifest loss"
  4,120,He gives them promises and excites vain desires in them; and the Shaitan does not promise them but to deceive
  4,121,"These are they whose abode is hell, and they shall not find any refuge from it"
