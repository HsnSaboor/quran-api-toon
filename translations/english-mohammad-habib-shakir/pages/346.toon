quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,60,And those who give what they give (in alms) while their hearts are full of fear that to their Lord they must return
  23,61,These hasten to good things and they are foremost in (attaining) them
  23,62,"And We do not lay on any soul a burden except to the extent of its ability, and with Us is a book which speaks the truth, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly"
  23,63,"Nay, their hearts are in overwhelming ignorance with respect to it and they have besides this other deeds which they do"
  23,64,"Until when We overtake those who lead easy lives among them with punishment, lo! they cry for succor"
  23,65,Cry not for succor this day; surely you shall not be given help from Us
  23,66,"My communications were indeed recited to you, but you used to turn back on your heels"
  23,67,"In arrogance; talking nonsense about the Quran, and left him like one telling fables by night"
  23,68,"Is it then that they do not ponder over what is said, or is it that there has come to them that which did not come to their fathers of old"
  23,69,"Or is it that they have not recognized their Apostle, so that they deny him"
  23,70,"Or do they say: There is madness in him? Nay! he has brought them the truth, and most of them are averse from the truth"
  23,71,"And should the truth follow their low desires, surely the heavens and the earth and all those who are therein would have perished. Nay! We have brought to them their reminder, but from their reminder they turn aside"
  23,72,"Or is it that you ask them a recompense? But the recompense of your Lord is best, and He is the best of those who provide sustenance"
  23,73,And most surely you invite them to a right way
  23,74,And most surely those who do not believe in the hereafter are deviating from the way
