quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,"And Our command is but one, as the twinkling of an eye"
  54,51,"And certainly We have already destroyed the likes of you, but is there anyone who will mind"
  54,52,And everything they have done is in the writings
  54,53,And everything small and great is written down
  54,54,Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in gardens and rivers
  54,55,In the seat of honor with a most Powerful King
  55,1,The Beneficent Allah
  55,2,Taught the Quran
  55,3,He created man
  55,4,Taught him the mode of expression
  55,5,The sun and the moon follow a reckoning
  55,6,And the herbs and the trees do prostrate (to Him)
  55,7,"And the heaven, He raised it high, and He made the balance"

  55,9,And keep up the balance with equity and do not make the measure deficient
  55,10,"And the earth, He has set it for living creatures"
  55,11,Therein is fruit and palms having sheathed clusters
  55,12,And the grain with (its) husk and fragrance
  55,13,Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
  55,14,He created man from dry clay like earthen vessels
  55,15,And He created the jinn of a flame of fire
  55,16,Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
