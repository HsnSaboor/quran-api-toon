quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"Who said: What! are you indeed of those who accept (the truth)"
  37,53,"What! when we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then be certainly brought to judgment"
  37,54,"He shall say: Will you look on"
  37,55,Then he looked down and saw him in the midst of hell
  37,56,"He shall say: By Allah! you had almost caused me to perish"
  37,57,"And had it not been for the favor of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought up"
  37,58,Is it then that we are not going to die
  37,59,Except our previous death? And we shall not be chastised
  37,60,Most surely this is the mighty achievement
  37,61,For the like of this then let the workers work
  37,62,Is this better as an entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum
  37,63,Surely We have made it to be a trial to the unjust
  37,64,Surely it is a tree that-grows in the bottom of the hell
  37,65,Its produce is as it were the heads of the serpents
  37,66,Then most surely they shall eat of it and fill (their) bellies with it
  37,67,Then most surely they shall have after it to drink of a mixture prepared in boiling water
  37,68,Then most surely their return shall be to hell
  37,69,Surely they found their fathers going astray
  37,70,So in their footsteps they are being hastened on
  37,71,And certainly most of the ancients went astray before them
  37,72,And certainly We sent among them warners
  37,73,Then see how was the end of those warned
  37,74,"Except the servants of Allah, the purified ones"
  37,75,"And Nuh did certainly call upon Us, and most excellent answerer of prayer are We"
  37,76,And We delivered him and his followers from the mighty distress
