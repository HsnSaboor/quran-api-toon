quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,Nay! most surely the record of the wicked is in the Sijjin
  83,8,And what will make you know what the Sijjin is
  83,9,It is a written book
  83,10,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  83,11,Who give the lie to the day of judgment
  83,12,"And none gives the lie to it but every exceeder of limits, sinful one"
  83,13,"When Our communications are recited to him, he says: Stories of those of yore"
  83,14,"Nay! rather, what they used to do has become like rust upon their hearts"
  83,15,Nay! most surely they shall on that day be debarred from their Lord
  83,16,Then most surely they shall enter the burning fire
  83,17,"Then shall it be said: This is what you gave the lie to"
  83,18,Nay! Most surely the record of the righteous shall be in the Iliyin
  83,19,And what will make you know what the highest Iliyin is
  83,20,It is a written book
  83,21,Those who are drawn near (to Allah) shall witness it
  83,22,Most surely the righteous shall be in bliss
  83,23,"On thrones, they shall gaze"
  83,24,You will recognize in their faces the brightness of bliss
  83,25,They are made to quaff of a pure drink that is sealed (to others)
  83,26,The sealing of it is (with) musk; and for that let the aspirers aspire
  83,27,And the admixture of it is a water of Tasnim
  83,28,A fountain from which drink they who are drawn near (to Allah)
  83,29,Surely they who are guilty used to laugh at those who believe
  83,30,"And when they passed by them, they winked at one another"
  83,31,And when they returned to their own followers they returned exulting
  83,32,"And when they saw them, they said: Most surely these are in error"
  83,33,And they were not sent to be keepers over them
  83,34,So today those who believe shall laugh at the unbelievers
