quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,16,"Those who say: Our Lord! surely we believe, therefore forgive us our faults and save us from the chastisement of the fire"
  3,17,"The patient, and the truthful, and the obedient, and those who spend (benevolently) and those who ask forgiveness in the morning times"
  3,18,"Allah bears witness that there is no god but He, and (so do) the angels and those possessed of knowledge, maintaining His creation with justice; there is no god but He, the Mighty, the Wise"
  3,19,"Surely the (true) religion with Allah is Islam, and those to whom the Book had been given did not show opposition but after knowledge had come to them, out of envy among themselves; and whoever disbelieves in the communications of Allah then surely Allah is quick in reckoning"
  3,20,"But if they dispute with you, say: I have submitted myself entirely to Allah and (so) every one who follows me; and say to those who have been given the Book and the unlearned people: Do you submit yourselves? So if they submit then indeed they follow the right way; and if they turn back, then upon you is only the delivery of the message and Allah sees the servants"
  3,21,"Surely (as for) those who disbelieve in the communications of Allah and slay the prophets unjustly and slay those among men who enjoin justice, announce to them a painful chastisement"
  3,22,"Those are they whose works shall become null in this world as well as the hereafter, and they shall have no helpers"
