quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,I swear by the daybreak
  89,2,And the ten nights
  89,3,And the even and the odd
  89,4,And the night when it departs
  89,5,Truly in that there is an oath for those who possess understanding
  89,6,Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with Ad
  89,7,"(The people of) Aram, possessors of lofty buildings"
  89,8,The like of which were not created in the (other) cities
  89,9,"And (with) Samood, who hewed out the rocks in the valley"
  89,10,"And (with) Firon, the lord of hosts"
  89,11,Who committed inordinacy in the cities
  89,12,So they made great mischief therein
  89,13,Therefore your Lord let down upon them a portion of the chastisement
  89,14,Most surely your Lord is watching
  89,15,"And as for man, when his Lord tries him, then treats him with honor and makes him lead an easy life, he says: My Lord honors me"
  89,16,"But when He tries him (differently), then straitens to him his means of subsistence, he says: My Lord has disgraced me"
  89,17,Nay! but you do not honor the orphan
  89,18,Nor do you urge one another to feed the poor
  89,19,"And you eat away the heritage, devouring (everything) indiscriminately"
  89,20,And you love wealth with exceeding love
  89,21,Nay! when the earth is made to crumble to pieces
  89,22,And your Lord comes and (also) the angels in ranks
  89,23,"And hell is made to appear on that day. On that day shall man be mindful, and what shall being mindful (then) avail him"
