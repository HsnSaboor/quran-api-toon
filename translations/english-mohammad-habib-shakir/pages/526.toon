quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,I swear by the star when it goes down
  53,2,"Your companion does not err, nor does he go astray"
  53,3,Nor does he speak out of desire
  53,4,It is naught but revelation that is revealed
  53,5,The Lord of Mighty Power has taught him
  53,6,The Lord of Strength; so he attained completion
  53,7,And he is in the highest part of the horizon
  53,8,"Then he drew near, then he bowed"
  53,9,So he was the measure of two bows or closer still
  53,10,And He revealed to His servant what He revealed
  53,11,The heart was not untrue in (making him see) what he saw
  53,12,What! do you then dispute with him as to what he saw
  53,13,And certainly he saw him in another descent
  53,14,At the farthest lote-tree
  53,15,"Near which is the garden, the place to be resorted to"
  53,16,When that which covers covered the lote-tree
  53,17,"The eye did not turn aside, nor did it exceed the limit"
  53,18,Certainly he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord
  53,19,Have you then considered the Lat and the Uzza
  53,20,"And Manat, the third, the last"
  53,21,What! for you the males and for Him the females
  53,22,This indeed is an unjust division
  53,23,"They are naught but names which you have named, you and your fathers; Allah has not sent for them any authority. They follow naught but conjecture and the low desires which (their) souls incline to; and certainly the guidance has come to them from their Lord"
  53,24,Or shall man have what he wishes
  53,25,Nay! for Allah is the hereafter and the former (life)
  53,26,And how many an angel is there in the heavens whose intercession does not avail at all except after Allah has given permission to whom He pleases and chooses
