quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,35,"And they who give associates (to Allah) say: If Allah had pleased, we would not have served anything besides Allah, (neither) we nor our fathers, nor would we have prohibited anything without (order from) Him. Thus did those before them; is then aught incumbent upon the apostles except a plain delivery (of the message)"
  16,36,"And certainly We raised in every nation an apostle saying: Serve Allah and shun the Shaitan. So there were some of them whom Allah guided and there were others against whom error was due; therefore travel in the land, then see what was the end of the rejecters"
  16,37,"If you desire for their guidance, yet surely Allah does not guide him who leads astray, nor shall they have any helpers"
  16,38,"And they swear by Allah with the most energetic of their oaths: Allah will not raise up him who dies. Yea! it is a promise binding on Him, quite true, but most people do not know"
  16,39,"So that He might make manifest to them that about which they differ, and that those who disbelieve might know that they were liars"
  16,40,"Our word for a thing when We intend it, is only that We say to it, Be, and it is"
  16,41,"And those who fly for Allah's sake after they are oppressed, We will most certainly give them a good abode in the world, and the reward of the hereafter is certainly much greater, did they but know"
  16,42,Those who are patient and on their Lord do they rely
