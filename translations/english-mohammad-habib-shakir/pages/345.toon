quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,43,No people can hasten on their doom nor can they postpone (it)
  23,44,"Then We sent Our apostles one after another; whenever there came to a people their apostle, they called him a liar, so We made some of them follow others and We made them stories; so away with a people who do not believe"
  23,45,"Then We sent Musa and his brother Haroun, with Our communications and a clear authority"
  23,46,"To Firon and his chiefs, but they behaved haughtily and they were an insolent people"
  23,47,"And they said: What! shall we believe in two mortals like ourselves while their people serve us"
  23,48,So they rejected them and became of those who were destroyed
  23,49,And certainly We gave Musa the Book that they may follow a right direction
  23,50,"And We made the son of Marium and his mother a sign, and We gave them a shelter on a lofty ground having meadows and springs"
  23,51,O apostles! eat of the good things and do good; surely I know what you do
  23,52,"And surely this your religion is one religion and I am your Lord, therefore be careful (of your duty) to Me"
  23,53,"But they cut off their religion among themselves into sects, each part rejoicing in that which is with them"
  23,54,Therefore leave them in their overwhelming ignorance till
  23,55,Do they think that by what We aid them with of wealth and children
  23,56,"We are hastening to them of good things? Nay, they do not perceive"
  23,57,Surely they who from fear of their Lord are cautious
  23,58,And those who believe in the communications of their Lord
  23,59,And those who do not associate (aught) with their Lord
