quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,For the protection of the Qureaish
  106,2,Their protection during their trading caravans in the winter and the summer
  106,3,So let them serve the Lord of this House
  106,4,Who feeds them against hunger and gives them security against fear
  107,1,Have you considered him who calls the judgment a lie
  107,2,That is the one who treats the orphan with harshness
  107,3,And does not urge (others) to feed the poor
  107,4,So woe to the praying ones
  107,5,Who are unmindful of their prayers
  107,6,Who do (good) to be seen
  107,7,And withhold the necessaries of life
  108,1,Surely We have given you Kausar
  108,2,Therefore pray to your Lord and make a sacrifice
  108,3,Surely your enemy is the one who shall be without posterity
