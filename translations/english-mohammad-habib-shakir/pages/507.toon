quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"(As for) those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah's way, He shall render their works ineffective"
  47,2,"And (as for) those who believe and do good, and believe in what has been revealed to Muhammad, and it is the very truth from their Lord, He will remove their evil from them and improve their condition"
  47,3,"That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, and have given them their dowries, taking (them) in marriage, not fornicating nor taking them for paramours in secret; and whoever denies faith, his work indeed is of no account, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers"
  47,4,"So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a favor or let them ransom (themselves) until the war terminates. That (shall be so); and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have exacted what is due from them, but that He may try some of you by means of others; and (as for) those who are slain in the way of Allah, He will by no means allow their deeds to perish"
  47,5,He will guide them and improve their condition
  47,6,And cause them to enter the garden which He has made known to them
  47,7,"O you who believe! if you help (the cause of) Allah, He will help you and make firm your feet"
  47,8,"And (as for) those who disbelieve, for them is destruction and He has made their deeds ineffective"
  47,9,"That is because they hated what Allah revealed, so He rendered their deeds null"
  47,10,"Have they not then journeyed in the land and seen how was the end of those before them: Allah brought down destruction upon them, and the unbelievers shall have the like of it"
  47,11,"That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe, and because the unbelievers shall have no protector for them"
