quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,103,So when they both submitted and he threw him down upon his forehead
  37,104,"And We called out to him saying: O Ibrahim"
  37,105,You have indeed shown the truth of the vision; surely thus do We reward the doers of good
  37,106,Most surely this is a manifest trial
  37,107,And We ransomed him with a Feat sacrifice
  37,108,And We perpetuated (praise) to him among the later generations
  37,109,Peace be on Ibrahim
  37,110,Thus do We reward the doers of good
  37,111,Surely he was one of Our believing servants
  37,112,"And We gave him the good news of Ishaq, a prophet among the good ones"
  37,113,"And We showered Our blessings on him and on Ishaq; and of their offspring are the doers of good, and (also) those who are clearly unjust to their own souls"
  37,114,And certainly We conferred a favor on Musa and Haroun
  37,115,And We delivered them both and their people from the mighty distress
  37,116,"And We helped them, so they were the vanquishers"
  37,117,And We gave them both the Book that made (things) clear
  37,118,And We guided them both on the right way
  37,119,And We perpetuated (praise) to them among the later generations
  37,120,Peace be on Musa and Haroun
  37,121,Even thus do We reward the doers of good
  37,122,Surely they were both of Our believing servants
  37,123,And Ilyas was most surely of the apostles
  37,124,"When he said to his people: Do you not guard (against evil)"
  37,125,What! do you call upon Ba'l and forsake the best of the creators
  37,126,"Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of yore"
