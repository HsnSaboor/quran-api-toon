quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  42,23,"That is of which Allah gives the good news to His servants, (to) those who believe and do good deeds. Say: I do not ask of you any reward for it but love for my near relatives; and whoever earns good, We give him more of good therein; surely Allah is Forgiving, Grateful"
  42,24,"Or do they say: He has forged a lie against Allah? But if Allah pleased, He would seal your heart; and Allah will blot out the falsehood and confirm the truth with His words; surely He is Cognizant of what is in the breasts"
  42,25,And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons the evil deeds and He knows what you do
  42,26,"And He answers those who believe and do good deeds, and gives them more out of His grace; and (as for) the unbelievers, they shall have a severe punishment"
  42,27,"And if Allah should amplify the provision for His servants they would certainly revolt in the earth; but He sends it down according to a measure as He pleases; surely He is Aware of, Seeing, His servants"
  42,28,"And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired, and He unfolds His mercy; and He is the Guardian, the Praised One"
  42,29,And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and what He has spread forth in both of them of living beings; and when He pleases He is all-powerful to gather them together
  42,30,"And whatever affliction befalls you, it is on account of what your hands have wrought, and (yet) He pardons most (of your faults)"
  42,31,"And you cannot escape in the earth, and you shall not have a guardian or a helper besides Allah"
