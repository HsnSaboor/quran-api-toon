quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"And when it is said to them: Come, the Apostle of Allah will ask forgiveness for you, they turn back their heads and you may see them turning away while they are big with pride"
  63,6,It is alike to them whether you beg forgiveness for them or do not beg forgiveness for them; Allah will never forgive them; surely Allah does not guide the transgressing people
  63,7,"They it is who say: Do not spend upon those who are with the Apostle of Allah until they break up. And Allah's are the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not understand"
  63,8,"They say: If we return to Medina, the mighty will surely drive out the meaner therefrom; and to Allah belongs the might and to His Apostle and to the believers, but the hypocrites do not know"
  63,9,"O you who believe! let not your wealth, or your children, divert you from the remembrance of Allah; and whoever does that, these are the losers"
  63,10,"And spend out of what We have given you before death comes to one of you, so that he should say: My Lord! why didst Thou not respite me to a near term, so that I should have given alms and been of the doers of good deeds"
  63,11,"And Allah does not respite a soul when its appointed term has come, and Allah is Aware of what you do"
