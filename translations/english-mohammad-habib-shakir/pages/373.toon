quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,137,This is naught but a custom of the ancients
  26,138,And we are not going to be punished
  26,139,"So they gave him the lie, then We destroyed them. Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe"
  26,140,"And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,141,Samood gave the lie to the apostles
  26,142,"When their brother Salih said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)"
  26,143,Surely I am a faithful apostle to you
  26,144,Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me
  26,145,And I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds
  26,146,Will you be left secure in what is here
  26,147,In gardens and fountains
  26,148,And cornfields and palm-trees having fine spadices
  26,149,And you hew houses out of the mountains exultingly

  26,151,And do not obey the bidding of the extravagant
  26,152,Who make mischief in the land and do not act aright

  26,156,"And do not touch her with evil, lest the punishment of a grievous day should overtake you"
  26,157,"But they hamstrung her, then regretted"
  26,158,"So the punishment overtook them. Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe"
  26,159,"And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful"
