quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,"And that He created pairs, the male and the female"
  53,46,From the small seed when it is adapted
  53,47,And that on Him is the bringing forth a second time
  53,48,And that He it is Who enriches and gives to hold
  53,49,And that He is the Lord of the Sirius
  53,50,And that He did destroy the Ad of old
  53,51,"And Samood, so He spared not"
  53,52,And the people of Nuh before; surely they were most unjust and inordinate
  53,53,And the overthrown cities did He overthrow
  53,54,So there covered them that which covered
  53,55,Which of your Lord's benefits will you then dispute about
  53,56,This is a warner of the warners of old
  53,57,The near event draws nigh
  53,58,There shall be none besides Allah to remove it
  53,59,Do you then wonder at this announcement
  53,60,And will you laugh and not weep
  53,61,While you are indulging in varieties
  53,62,So make obeisance to Allah and serve (Him)
  54,1,The hour drew nigh and the moon did rend asunder
  54,2,"And if they see a miracle they turn aside and say: Transient magic"
  54,3,"And they call (it) a lie, and follow their low desires; and every affair has its appointed term"
  54,4,And certainly some narratives have come to them wherein is prevention
  54,5,Consummate wisdom-- but warnings do not avail
  54,6,So turn (your) back on them (for) the day when the inviter shall invite them to a hard task
