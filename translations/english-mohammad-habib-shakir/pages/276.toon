  16,80,"And Allah has given you a place to abide in your houses, and He has given you tents of the skins of cattle which you find light to carry on the day of your march and on the day of your halting, and of their wool and their fur and their hair (He has given you) household stuff and a provision for a time"
  16,81,"And Allah has made for you of what He has created shelters, and He has given you in the mountains places of retreat, and He has given you garments to preserve you from the heat and coats of mail to preserve you in your fighting; even thus does He complete His favor upon you, that haply you may submit"
  16,82,"But if they turn back, then on you devolves only the clear deliverance (of the message)"
  16,83,"They recognize the favor of Allah, yet they deny it, and most of them are ungrateful"
  16,84,"And on the day when We will raise up a witness out of every nation, then shall no permission be given to those who disbelieve, nor shall they be made to solicit favor"
  16,85,"And when those who are unjust shall see the chastisement, it shall not be lightened for them, nor shall they be respited"
  16,86,"And when those who associate (others with Allah) shall see their associate-gods, they shall say: Our Lord, these are our associate-gods on whom we called besides Thee. But they will give them back the reply: Most surely you are liars"
  16,87,And they shall tender submission to Allah on that day; and what they used to forge shall depart from them
