quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  23,105,Were not My communications recited to you? But you used to reject them
  23,106,"They shall say: O our Lord! our adversity overcame us and we were an erring people"
  23,107,O our Lord! Take us out of it; then if we return (to evil) surely we shall be unjust
  23,108,"He shall say: Go away into it and speak not to Me"
  23,109,"Surely there was a party of My servants who said: O our Lord! we believe, so do Thou forgive us and have mercy on us, and Thou art the best of the Merciful ones"
  23,110,But you took them for a mockery until they made you forget My remembrance and you used to laugh at them
  23,111,"Surely I have rewarded them this day because they were patient, that they are the achievers"
  23,112,"He will say: How many years did you tarry in the earth"
  23,113,"They will say: We tarried a day or part of a day, but ask those who keep account"
  23,114,"He will say: You did tarry but a little-- had you but known (it)"
  23,115,What! did you then think that We had created you in vain and that you shall not be returned to Us
  23,116,"So exalted be Allah, the True King; no god is there but He, the Lord of the honorable dominion"
  23,117,And whoever invokes with Allah another god-- he has no proof of this-- his reckoning is only with his Lord; surely the unbelievers shall not be successful
  23,118,"And say: O my Lord! forgive and have mercy, and Thou art the best of the Merciful ones"
