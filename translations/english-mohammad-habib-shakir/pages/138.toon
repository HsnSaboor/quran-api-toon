  6,84,"And We gave to him Ishaq and Yaqoub; each did We guide, and Nuh did We guide before, and of his descendants, Dawood and Sulaiman and Ayub and Yusuf and Musa and Haroun; and thus do We reward those who do good (to others)"
  6,85,And Zakariya and Yahya and Isa and Ilyas; every one was of the good
  6,86,And Ismail and Al-Yasha and Yunus and Lut; and every one We made to excel (in) the worlds

  6,89,These are they to whom We gave the book and the wisdom and the prophecy; therefore if these disbelieve in it We have already entrusted with it a people who are not disbelievers in it
  6,90,"These are they whom Allah guided, therefore follow their guidance. Say: I do not ask you for any reward for it; it is nothing but a reminder to the nations"
