quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  44,40,"Surely the day of separation is their appointed term, of all of them"
  44,41,"The day on which a friend shall not avail (his) friend aught, nor shall they be helped"
  44,42,Save those on whom Allah shall have mercy; surely He is the Mighty the Merciful
  44,43,Surely the tree of the Zaqqum
  44,44,Is the food of the sinful
  44,45,Like dregs of oil; it shall boil in (their) bellies
  44,46,Like the boiling of hot water
  44,47,"Seize him, then drag him down into the middle of the hell"
  44,48,Then pour above his head of the torment of the boiling water
  44,49,"Taste; you forsooth are the mighty, the honorable"
  44,50,Surely this is what you disputed about
  44,51,Surely those who guard (against evil) are in a secure place
  44,52,In gardens and springs
  44,53,"They shall wear of fine and thick silk, (sitting) face to face"
  44,54,"Thus (shall it be), and We will wed them with Houris pure, beautiful ones"
  44,55,They shall call therein for every fruit in security
  44,56,"They shall not taste therein death except the first death, and He will save them from the punishment of the hell"
  44,57,A grace from your Lord; this is the great achievement
  44,58,So have We made it easy in your tongue that they may be mindful
  44,59,Therefore wait; surely they are waiting
