  15,2,Often will those who disbelieve wish that they had been Muslims
  15,3,"Leave them that they may eat and enjoy themselves and (that) hope may beguile them, for they will soon know"
  15,4,And never did We destroy a town but it had a term made known
  15,5,No people can hasten on their doom nor can they postpone (it)
  15,6,"And they say: O you to whom the Reminder has been revealed! you are most surely insane"
  15,7,Why do you not bring to us the angels if you are of the truthful ones
  15,8,"We do not send the angels but with truth, and then they would not be respited"
  15,9,Surely We have revealed the Reminder and We will most surely be its guardian
  15,10,And certainly We sent (apostles) before you among the nations of yore
  15,11,And there never came an apostle to them but they mocked him
  15,12,Thus do We make it to enter into the hearts of the guilty
  15,13,"They do not believe in it, and indeed the example of the former people has already passed"
  15,14,"And even if We open to them a gateway of heaven, so that they ascend into it all the while"
  15,15,"They would certainly say: Only our eyes have been covered over, rather we are an enchanted people"
