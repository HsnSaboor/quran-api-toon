  43,12,"And He Who created pairs of all things, and made for you of the ships and the cattle what you ride on"
  43,13,"That you may firmly sit on their backs, then remember the favor of your Lord when you are firmly seated thereon, and say: Glory be to Him Who made this subservient to us and we were not able to do it"
  43,14,And surely to our Lord we must return
  43,15,"And they assign to Him a part of His servants; man, to be sure, is clearly ungrateful"
