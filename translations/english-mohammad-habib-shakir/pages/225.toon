quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,"And, O my people! I ask you not for wealth in return for it; my reward is only with Allah and I am not going to drive away those who believe; surely they shall meet their Lord, but I consider you a people who are ignorant"
  11,30,"And, O my people! who will help me against Allah if I drive them away? Will you not then mind"
  11,31,"And I do not say to you that I have the treasures of Allah and I do not know the unseen, nor do I say that I am an angel, nor do I say about those whom your eyes hold in mean estimation (that) Allah will never grant them (any) good-- Allah knows best what is in their souls-- for then most surely I should be of the unjust"
  11,32,"They said: O Nuh! indeed you have disputed with us and lengthened dispute with us, therefore bring to us what you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful ones"
  11,33,"He said: Allah only will bring it to you if He please, and you will not escape"
  11,34,"And if I intend to give you good advice, my advice will not profit you if Allah intended that He should leave you to go astray; He is your Lord, and to Him shall you be returned"
  11,35,"Or do they say: He has forged it? Say: If I have forged it, on me is my guilt, and I am clear of that of which you are guilty"
  11,36,"And it was revealed to Nuh: That none of your people will believe except those who have already believed, therefore do not grieve at what they do"
  11,37,"And make the ark before Our eyes and (according to) Our revelation, and do not speak to Me in respect of those who are unjust; surely they shall be drowned"
