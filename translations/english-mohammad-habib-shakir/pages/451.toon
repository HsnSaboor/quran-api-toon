quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"But they called him a liar, therefore they shall most surely be brought up"
  37,128,"But not the servants of Allah, the purified ones"
  37,129,And We perpetuated to him (praise) among the later generations
  37,130,Peace be on Ilyas
  37,131,Even thus do We reward the doers of good
  37,132,Surely he was one of Our believing servants
  37,133,And Lut was most surely of the apostles
  37,134,"When We delivered him and his followers, all"
  37,135,Except an old woman (who was) amongst those who tarried
  37,136,Then We destroyed the others
  37,137,And most surely you pass by them in the morning
  37,138,And at night; do you not then understand
  37,139,And Yunus was most surely of the apostles
  37,140,When he ran away to a ship completely laden
  37,141,"So he shared (with them), but was of those who are cast off"
  37,142,So the fish swallowed him while he did that for which he blamed himself
  37,143,But had it not been that he was of those who glorify (Us)
  37,144,He would certainly have tarried in its belly to the day when they are raised
  37,145,Then We cast him on to the vacant surface of the earth while he was sick
  37,146,And We caused to grow up for him a gourdplant
  37,147,"And We sent him to a hundred thousand, rather they exceeded"
  37,148,"And they believed, so We gave them provision till a time"
  37,149,Then ask them whether your Lord has daughters and they have sons
  37,150,Or did We create the angels females while they were witnesses
  37,151,Now surely it is of their own lie that they say
  37,152,Allah has begotten; and most surely they are liars
  37,153,Has He chosen daughters in preference to sons
