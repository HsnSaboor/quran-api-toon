quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,31,"Being upright for Allah, not associating aught with Him and whoever associates (others) with Allah, it is as though he had fallen from on high, then the birds snatch him away or the wind carries him off to a far-distant place"
  22,32,"That (shall be so); and whoever respects the signs of Allah, this surely is (the outcome) of the piety of hearts"
  22,33,"You have advantages in them till a fixed time, then their place of sacrifice is the Ancient House"
  22,34,"And to every nation We appointed acts of devotion that they may mention the name of Allah on what He has given them of the cattle quadrupeds; so your god is One God, therefore to Him should you submit, and give good news to the humble"
  22,35,"(To) those whose hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned, and those who are patient under that which afflicts them, and those who keep up prayer, and spend (benevolently) out of what We have given them"
  22,36,"And (as for) the camels, We have made them of the signs of the religion of Allah for you; for you therein is much good; therefore mention the name of Allah on them as they stand in a row, then when they fall down eat of them and feed the poor man who is contented and the beggar; thus have We made them subservient to you, that you may be grateful"
  22,37,"There does not reach Allah their flesh nor their blood, but to Him is acceptable the guarding (against evil) on your part; thus has He made them subservient to you, that you may magnify Allah because He has guided you aright; and give good news to those who do good (to others)"
  22,38,"Surely Allah will defend those who believe; surely Allah does not love any one who is unfaithful, ungrateful"
