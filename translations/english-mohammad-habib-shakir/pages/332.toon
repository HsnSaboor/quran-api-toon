quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  22,1,O people! guard against (the punishment from) your Lord; surely the violence of the hour is a grievous thing
  22,2,"On the day when you shall see it, every woman giving suck shall quit in confusion what she suckled, and every pregnant woman shall lay down her burden, and you shall see men intoxicated, and they shall not be intoxicated but the chastisement of Allah will be severe"
  22,3,And among men there is he who disputes about Allah without knowledge and follows every rebellious Shaitan
  22,4,"Against him it is written down that whoever takes him for a friend, he shall lead him astray and conduct him to the chastisement of the burning fire"
  22,5,"O people! if you are in doubt about the raising, then surely We created you from dust, then from a small seed, then from a clot, then from a lump of flesh, complete in make and incomplete, that We may make clear to you; and We cause what We please to stay in the wombs till an appointed time, then We bring you forth as babies, then that you may attain your maturity; and of you is he who is caused to die, and of you is he who is brought back to the worst part of life, so that after having knowledge he does not know anything; and you see the earth sterile land, but when We send down on it the water, it stirs and swells and brings forth of every kind a beautiful herbage"
