quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,That which they were made to enjoy shall not avail them
  26,208,And We did not destroy any town but it had (its) warners
  26,209,"To remind, and We are never unjust"
  26,210,And the Shaitans have not come down with it
  26,211,"And it behoves them not, and they have not the power to do (it)"
  26,212,Most surely they are far removed from the hearing of it
  26,213,"So call not upon another god with Allah, lest you be of those who are punished"
  26,214,And warn your nearest relations
  26,215,And be kind to him who follows you of the believers
  26,216,"But if they disobey you, then say: Surely I am clear of what you do"
  26,217,"And rely on the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,218,Who sees you when you stand up
  26,219,And your turning over and over among those who prostrate themselves before Allah
  26,220,"Surely He is the Hearing, the Knowing"
  26,221,Shall I inform you (of him) upon whom the Shaitans descend
  26,222,"They descend upon every lying, sinful one"
  26,223,"They incline their ears, and most of them are liars"
  26,224,"And as to the poets, those who go astray follow them"
  26,225,Do you not see that they wander about bewildered in every valley
  26,226,And that they say that which they do not do
  26,227,"Except those who believe and do good and remember Allah much, and defend themselves after they are oppressed; and they who act unjustly shall know to what final place of turning they shall turn back"
