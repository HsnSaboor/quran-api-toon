  45,14,Say to those who believe (that) they forgive those who do not fear the days of Allah that He may reward a people for what they earn
  45,15,"Whoever does good, it is for his own soul, and whoever does evil, it is against himself; then you shall be brought back to your-- Lord"
  45,16,"And certainly We gave the Book and the wisdom and the prophecy to the children of Israel, and We gave them of the goodly things, and We made them excel the nations"
  45,17,"And We gave them clear arguments in the affair, but they did not differ until after knowledge had come to them out of envy among themselves; surely your -Lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they differed"
  45,18,"Then We have made you follow a course in the affair, therefore follow it, and do not follow the low desires of those who do not know"
