quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,44,"Or do you think that most of them do hear or understand? They are nothing but as cattle; nay, they are straying farther off from the path"
  25,45,"Have you not considered (the work of) your Lord, how He extends the shade? And if He had pleased He would certainly have made it stationary; then We have made the sun an indication of it"
  25,46,"Then We take it to Ourselves, taking little by little"
  25,47,"And He it is Who made the night a covering for you, and the sleep a rest, and He made the day to rise up again"
  25,48,And He it is Who sends the winds as good news before His mercy; and We send down pure water from the cloud
  25,49,"That We may give life thereby to a dead land and give it for drink, out of what We have created, to cattle and many people"
  25,50,"And certainly We have repeated this to them that they may be mindful, but the greater number of men do not consent to aught except denying"
  25,51,And if We had pleased We would certainly have raised a warner in every town
  25,52,"So do not follow the unbelievers, and strive against them a mighty striving with it"
  25,53,"And He it is Who has made two seas to flow freely, the one sweet that subdues thirst by its sweetness, and the other salt that burns by its saltness; and between the two He has made a barrier and inviolable obstruction"
  25,54,"And He it is Who has created man from the water, then He has made for him blood relationship and marriage relationship, and your Lord is powerful"
  25,55,And they serve besides Allah that which neither profits them nor causes them harm; and the unbeliever is a partisan against his Lord
