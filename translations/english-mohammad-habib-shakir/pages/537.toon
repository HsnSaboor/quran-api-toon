quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,Most surely it is an honored Quran
  56,78,In a book that is protected
  56,79,None shall touch it save the purified ones
  56,80,A revelation by the Lord of the worlds
  56,81,Do you then hold this announcement in contempt
  56,82,And to give (it) the lie you make your means of subsistence
  56,83,Why is it not then that when it (soul) comes up to the throat
  56,84,And you at that time look on
  56,85,"And We are nearer to it than you, but you do not see"
  56,86,Then why is it not-- if you are not held under authority
  56,87,That you send it (not) back-- if you are truthful
  56,88,Then if he is one of those drawn nigh (to Allah)
  56,89,Then happiness and bounty and a garden of bliss
  56,90,And if he is one of those on the right hand
  56,91,Then peace to you from those on the right hand
  56,92,"And if he is one of the rejecters, the erring ones"
  56,93,He shall have an entertainment of boiling water
  56,94,And burning in hell
  56,95,Most surely this is a certain truth
  56,96,"Therefore glorify the name of your Lord, the Great"
  57,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and the earth declares the glory of Allah, and He is the Mighty, the Wise"
  57,2,His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He gives life and causes death; and He has power over all things
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last and the Ascendant (over all) and the Knower of hidden things, and He is Cognizant of all things"
