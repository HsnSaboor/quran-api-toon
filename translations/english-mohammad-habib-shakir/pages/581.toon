quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Did We not create you from contemptible water
  77,21,Then We placed it in a secure resting-place
  77,22,Till an appointed term
  77,23,So We proportion it-- how well are We at proportioning (things)
  77,24,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,25,Have We not made the earth to draw together to itself
  77,26,The living and the dead
  77,27,"And made therein lofty mountains, and given you to drink of sweet water"
  77,28,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,29,Walk on to that which you called a lie
  77,30,Walk on to the covering having three branches
  77,31,Neither having the coolness of the shade nor availing against the flame
  77,32,Surely it sends up sparks like palaces
  77,33,As if they were tawny camels
  77,34,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,35,This is the day on which they shall not speak
  77,36,And permission shall not be given to them so that they should offer excuses
  77,37,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,38,"This is the day of decision: We have gathered you and those of yore"
  77,39,"So if you have a plan, plan against Me (now)"
  77,40,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,41,Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be amid shades and fountains
  77,42,And fruits such as they desire
  77,43,Eat and drink pleasantly because of what you did
  77,44,Surely thus do We reward the doers of good
  77,45,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,46,Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little; surely you are guilty
  77,47,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,48,"And where it is said to them: Bow down, they do not bow down"
  77,49,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,50,"In what announcement, then, after it, will they believe"
