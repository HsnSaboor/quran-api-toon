quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  15,71,"He said: These are my daughters, if you will do (aught)"
  15,72,By your life! they were blindly wandering on in their intoxication
  15,73,So the rumbling overtook them (while) entering upon the time of sunrise
  15,74,"Thus did We turn it upside down, and rained down upon them stones of what had been decreed"
  15,75,Surely in this are signs for those who examine
  15,76,And surely it is on a road that still abides
  15,77,Most surely there is a sign in this for the believers
  15,78,And the dwellers of the thicket also were most surely unjust
  15,79,"So We inflicted retribution on them, and they are both, indeed, on an open road (still) pursued"
  15,80,And the dwellers of the Rock certainly rejected the apostles
  15,81,"And We gave them Our communications, but they turned aside from them"
  15,82,And they hewed houses in the mountains in security
  15,83,So the rumbling overtook them in the morning
  15,84,And what they earned did not avail them
  15,85,"And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them two but in truth; and the hour is most surely coming, so turn away with kindly forgiveness"
  15,86,"Surely your Lord is the Creator of all things, the Knowing"
  15,87,And certainly We have given you seven of the oft-repeated (verses) and the grand Quran
  15,88,"Do not strain your eyes after what We have given certain classes of them to enjoy, and do not grieve for them, and make yourself gentle to the believers"
  15,89,"And say: Surely I am the plain warner"
  15,90,Like as We sent down on the dividers
