quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  54,7,"Their eyes cast down, going forth from their graves as if they were scattered locusts"
  54,8,"Hastening to the inviter. The unbelievers shall say: This is a hard day"
  54,9,"Before them the people of Nuh rejected, so they rejected Our servant and called (him) mad, and he was driven away"
  54,10,"Therefore he called upon his Lord: I am overcome, come Thou then to help"
  54,11,So We opened the gates of the cloud with water pouring
  54,12,"And We made water to flow forth in the land in springs, so the water gathered together according to a measure already ordained"
  54,13,And We bore him on that which was made of planks and nails
  54,14,"Sailing, before Our eyes, a reward for him who was denied"
  54,15,"And certainly We left it as a sign, but is there anyone who"
  54,16,How (great) was then My punishment and My warning
  54,17,"And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who will mind"
  54,18,"Ad treated (the truth) as a lie, so how (great) was My punishment and My warning"
  54,19,Surely We sent on them a tornado in a day of bitter ill-luck
  54,20,Tearing men away as if they were the trunks of palm-trees torn up
  54,21,How (great) was then My punishment and My warning
  54,22,"And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who will mind"
  54,23,Samood rejected the warning
  54,24,"So they said: What! a single mortal from among us! Shall we follow him? Most surely we shall in that case be in sure error and distress"
  54,25,Has the reminder been made to light upon him from among us? Nay! he is an insolent liar
  54,26,"Tomorrow shall they know who is the liar, the insolent one"
  54,27,Surely We are going to send the she-camel as a trial for them; therefore watch them and have patience
