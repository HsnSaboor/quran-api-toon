quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"And those who believe say: Why has not a chapter been revealed? But when a decisive chapter is revealed, and fighting is mentioned therein you see those in whose hearts is a disease look to you with the look of one fainting because of death. Woe to them then"
  47,21,"Obedience and a gentle word (was proper); but when the affair becomes settled, then if they remain true to Allah it would certainly be better for them"
  47,22,"But if you held command, you were sure to make mischief in the land and cut off the ties of kinship"
  47,23,Those it is whom Allah has cursed so He has made them deaf and blinded their eyes
  47,24,"Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Nay, on the hearts there are locks"
  47,25,"Surely (as for) those who return on their backs after that guidance has become manifest to them, the Shaitan has made it a light matter to them; and He gives them respite"
  47,26,"That is because they say to those who hate what Allah has revealed: We will obey you in some of the affairs; and Allah knows their secrets"
  47,27,But how will it be when the angels cause them to die smiting their backs
  47,28,"That is because they follow what is displeasing to Allah and are averse to His pleasure, therefore He has made null their deeds"
  47,29,Or do those in whose hearts is a disease think that Allah will not bring forth their spite
