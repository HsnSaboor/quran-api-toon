quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  21,11,"And how many a town which was iniquitous did We demolish, and We raised up after it another people"
  21,12,"So when they felt Our punishment, lo! they began to fly"
  21,13,"Do not fly (now) and come back to what you were made to lead easy lives in and to your dwellings, haply you will be questioned"
  21,14,"They said: O woe to us! surely we were unjust"
  21,15,"And this ceased not to be their cry till We made them cut off, extinct"
  21,16,And We did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between them for sport
  21,17,"Had We wished to make a diversion, We would have made it from before Ourselves: by no means would We do (it)"
  21,18,"Nay! We cast the truth against the falsehood, so that it breaks its head, and lo! it vanishes; and woe to you for what you describe"
  21,19,"And whoever is in the heavens and the earth is His; and those who are with Him are not proud to serve Him, nor do they grow weary"
  21,20,They glorify (Him) by night and day; they are never languid
  21,21,Or have they taken gods from the earth who raise (the dead)
  21,22,"If there had been in them any gods except Allah, they would both have certainly been in a state of disorder; therefore glory be to Allah, the Lord of the dominion, above what they attribute (to Him)"
  21,23,He cannot be questioned concerning what He does and they shall be questioned
  21,24,"Or, have they taken gods besides Him? Say: Bring your proof; this is the reminder of those with me and the reminder of those before me. Nay! most of them do not know the truth, so they turn aside"
