  10,26,For those who do good is good (reward) and more (than this); and blackness or ignominy shall not cover their faces; these are the dwellers of the garden; in it they shall abide

  10,30,"There shall every soul become acquainted with what it sent before, and they shall be brought back to Allah, their true Patron, and what they devised shall escape from them"
  10,31,"Say: Who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth? Or Who controls the hearing and the sight?

  10,33,Thus does the word of your Lord prove true against those who transgress that they do not believe
