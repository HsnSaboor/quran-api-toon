quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,71,O followers of the Book! Why do you confound the truth with the falsehood and hide the truth while you know
  3,72,"And a party of the followers of the Book say: Avow belief in that which has been revealed to those who believe, in the first part of the day, and disbelieve at the end of it, perhaps they go back on their religion"
  3,73,"And do not believe but in him who follows your religion.

Say: Surely grace is in the hand of Allah, He gives it to whom He pleases; and Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing"
  3,74,He specially chooses for His mercy whom He pleases; and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace

  3,76,"Yea, whoever fulfills his promise and guards (against evil)-- then surely Allah loves those who guard (against evil)"
  3,77,"(As for) those who take a small price for the covenant of Allah and their own oaths-- surely they shall have no portion in the hereafter, and Allah will not speak to them, nor will He look upon them on the day of resurrection nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful chastisement"
