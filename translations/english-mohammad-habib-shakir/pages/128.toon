  6,2,"He it is Who created you from clay, then He decreed a term; and there is a term named with Him; still you doubt"
  6,3,"And He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth; He knows your secret (thoughts) and your open (words), and He knows what you earn"
  6,4,And there does not come to them any communication of the communications of their Lord but they turn aside from it
  6,5,So they have indeed rejected the truth when it came to them; therefore the truth of what they mocked at will shine upon them
  6,6,"Do they not consider how many a generation We have destroyed before them, whom We had established in the earth as We have not established you, and We sent the clouds pouring rain on them in abundance, and We made the rivers to flow beneath them, then We destroyed them on account of their faults and raised up after them another generation"
  6,7,"And if We had sent to you a writing on a paper, then they had touched it with their hands, certainly those who disbelieve would have said: This is nothing but clear enchantment"
  6,8,"And they say: Why has not an angel been sent down to him? And had We sent down an angel, the matter would have certainly been decided and then they would not have been respited"
