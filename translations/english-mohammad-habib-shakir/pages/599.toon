quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  98,8,"Their reward with their Lord is gardens of perpetuity beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein for ever; Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him; that is for him who fears his Lord"
  99,1,When the earth is shaken with her (violent) shaking
  99,2,And the earth brings forth her burdens
  99,3,"And man says: What has befallen her"
  99,4,On that day she shall tell her news
  99,5,Because your Lord had inspired her
  99,6,On that day men shall come forth in sundry bodies that they may be shown their works
  99,7,So. he who has done an atom's weight of good shall see it
  99,8,And he who has done an atom's weight of evil shall see it
  100,1,I swear by the runners breathing pantingly
  100,2,Then those that produce fire striking
  100,3,Then those that make raids at morn
  100,4,Then thereby raise dust
  100,5,Then rush thereby upon an assembly
  100,6,Most surely man is ungrateful to his Lord
  100,7,And most surely he is a witness of that
  100,8,And most surely he is tenacious in the love of wealth
  100,9,Does he not then know when what is in the graves is raised
