quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,I swear by the fig and the olive
  95,2,And mount Sinai
  95,3,And this city made secure
  95,4,Certainly We created man in the best make
  95,5,Then We render him the lowest of the low
  95,6,"Except those who believe and do good, so they shall have a reward never to be cut off"
  95,7,Then who can give you the lie after (this) about the judgment
  95,8,Is not Allah the best of the Judges
  96,1,Read in the name of your Lord Who created
  96,2,He created man from a clot
  96,3,Read and your Lord is Most Honorable
  96,4,Who taught (to write) with the pen
  96,5,Taught man what he knew not
  96,6,Nay! man is most surely inordinate
  96,7,Because he sees himself free from want
  96,8,Surely to your Lord is the return
  96,9,Have you seen him who forbids
  96,10,A servant when he prays
  96,11,Have you considered if he were on the right way
  96,12,Or enjoined guarding (against evil)
  96,13,Have you considered if he gives the lie to the truth and turns (his) back
  96,14,Does he not know that Allah does see
  96,15,"Nay! if he desist not, We would certainly smite his forehead"
  96,16,"A lying, sinful forehead"
  96,17,Then let him summon his council
  96,18,We too would summon the braves of the army
  96,19,"Nay! obey him not, and make obeisance and draw nigh (to Allah)"
