quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,Successful indeed are the believers
  23,2,Who are humble in their prayers
  23,3,And who keep aloof from what is vain
  23,4,And who are givers of poor-rate
  23,5,And who guard their private parts
  23,6,"Except before their mates or those whom their right hands possess, for they surely are not blameable"
  23,7,"But whoever seeks to go beyond that, these are they that exceed the limits"
  23,8,And those who are keepers of their trusts and their covenant
  23,9,And those who keep a guard on their prayers
  23,10,These are they who are the heirs
  23,11,Who shall inherit the Paradise; they shall abide therein
  23,12,And certainly We created man of an extract of clay
  23,13,Then We made him a small seed in a firm resting-place
  23,14,"Then We made the seed a clot, then We made the clot a lump of flesh, then We made (in) the lump of flesh bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, then We caused it to grow into another creation, so blessed be Allah, the best of the creators"
  23,15,Then after that you will most surely die
  23,16,Then surely on the day of resurrection you shall be raised
  23,17,And certainly We made above you seven heavens; and never are We heedless of creation
