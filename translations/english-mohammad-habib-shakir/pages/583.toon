quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,Surely for those who guard (against evil) is achievement
  78,32,Gardens and vineyards
  78,33,And voluptuous women of equal age
  78,34,And a pure cup
  78,35,They shall not hear therein any vain words nor lying
  78,36,"A reward from your Lord, a gift according to a reckoning"
  78,37,"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, the Beneficent Allah, they shall not be able to address Him"
  78,38,The day on which the spirit and the angels shall stand in ranks; they shall not speak except he whom the Beneficent Allah permits and who speaks the right thing
  78,39,"That is the sure day, so whoever desires may take refuge with his Lord"
  78,40,"Surely We have warned you of a chastisement near at hand: the day when man shall see what his two hands have sent before, and the unbeliever shall say: O! would that I were dust"
  79,1,I swear by the angels who violently pull out the souls of the wicked
  79,2,And by those who gently draw out the souls of the blessed
  79,3,And by those who float in space
  79,4,Then those who are foremost going ahead
  79,5,Then those who regulate the affair
  79,6,The day on which the quaking one shall quake
  79,7,What must happen afterwards shall follow it
  79,8,Hearts on that day shall palpitate
  79,9,Their eyes cast down
  79,10,"They say: Shall we indeed be restored to (our) first state"
  79,11,What! when we are rotten bones
  79,12,"They said: That then would be a return occasioning loss"
  79,13,But it shall be only a single cry
  79,14,When lo! they shall be wakeful
  79,15,Has not there come to you the story of Musa
