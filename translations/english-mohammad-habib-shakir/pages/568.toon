quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,Therefore he has not here today a true friend
  69,36,Nor any food except refuse
  69,37,Which none but the wrongdoers eat
  69,38,But nay! I swear by that which you see
  69,39,And that which you do not see
  69,40,"Most surely, it is the Word brought by an honored Apostle"
  69,41,And it is not the word of a poet; little is it that you believe
  69,42,Nor the word of a soothsayer; little is it that you mind
  69,43,It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
  69,44,And if he had fabricated against Us some of the sayings
  69,45,We would certainly have seized him by the right hand
  69,46,Then We would certainly have cut off his aorta
  69,47,And not one of you could have withheld Us from him
  69,48,And most surely it is a reminder for those who guard (against evil)
  69,49,And most surely We know that some of you are rejecters
  69,50,And most surely it is a great grief to the unbelievers
  69,51,And most surely it is the true certainty
  69,52,"Therefore-glorify the name of your Lord, the Great"
  70,1,"One demanding, demanded the chastisement which must befall"
  70,2,The unbelievers-- there is none to avert it
  70,3,"From Allah, the Lord of the ways of Ascent"
  70,4,To Him ascend the angels and the Spirit in a day the measure of which is fifty thousand years
  70,5,Therefore endure with a goodly patience
  70,6,Surely they think it to be far off
  70,7,And We see it nigh
  70,8,On the day when the heaven shall be as molten copper
  70,9,And the mountains shall be as tufts of wool
  70,10,And friend shall not ask of friend
