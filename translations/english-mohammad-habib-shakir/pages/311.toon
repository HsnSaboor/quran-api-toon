  19,77,"Have you, then, seen him who disbelieves in Our communications and says: I shall certainly be given wealth and children"
  19,78,"Has he gained knowledge of the unseen, or made a covenant with the Beneficent Allah"
  19,79,"By no means! We write down what he says, and We will lengthen to him the length of the chastisement"
  19,80,"And We will inherit of him what he says, and he shall come to Us alone"
  19,81,"And they have taken gods besides Allah, that they should be to them a source of strength"
  19,82,"By no means! They shall soon deny their worshipping them, and they shall be adversaries to them"
  19,83,"Do you not see that We have sent the Shaitans against the unbelievers, inciting them by incitement"
  19,84,"Therefore be not in haste against them, We only number out to them a number (of days)"
  19,85,The day on which We will gather those who guard (against evil) to the Beneficent Allah to receive honors
  19,86,And We will drive the guilty to hell thirsty
  19,87,"They shall not control intercession, save he who has made a covenant with the Beneficent Allah"
  19,88,"And they say: The Beneficent Allah has taken (to Himself) a son"
  19,89,Certainly you have made an abominable assertion
  19,90,"The heavens may almost be rent thereat, and the earth cleave asunder, and the mountains fall down in pieces"
  19,91,That they ascribe a son to the Beneficent Allah
  19,92,And it is not worthy of the Beneficent Allah that He should take (to Himself) a son
  19,93,There is no one in the heavens and the earth but will come to the Beneficent Allah as a servant
  19,94,Certainly He has a comprehensive knowledge of them and He has numbered them a (comprehensive) numbering
  19,95,And every one of them will come to Him on the day of resurrection alone
