quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,38,"Nor those who spend of their substance, to be seen of men, but have no faith in Allah and the Last Day: If any take the Satan for their close friend, what a dreadful friend he is"
  4,39,"And what is the burden on them if they had Faith in Allah and in the Last Day, and they spend out of what Allah has given to them for living? For Allah is All Knowing (Aleem) of them"
  4,40,"Surely, Allah is never unjust in the least degree: If there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from His own Presence a great reward"
  4,41,"What if We brought from each people a witness, and We brought you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these people"
  4,42,"On that Day, those who reject Faith and disobey the messenger (Muhammad) will wish that they were buried in the earth: But never will they hide a single fact from Allah"
  4,43,"O you who believe! Do not approach prayers (in a murky mind) intoxicated, until you can understand all that you say— Nor in a state of ceremonial impurity except when traveling on the road, until after washing your whole body; And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes from offices of nature, or you have been in contact with women, and you find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth and rub with it your faces and hands. Truly, Allah is Ever-Pardoning (’Afuw) and All Forgiving (Ghafoor, again and again)"
  4,44,"Have you not taken a look at those who were given a portion of the Book? They deal in error, and wish that you should lose the right path"
