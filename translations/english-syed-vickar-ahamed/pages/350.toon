  24,2,"The woman and the man guilty of adultery (unlawful sexual relations) severely whip each of them with a hundred stripes: Do not let kindness move you in their case— In a matter that is already decided by Allah, if you (truly) believe in Allah and the Last Day: And let a party of the believers witness their punishment"
  24,3,"Let not any man guilty of adultery (unlawful sexual relations) marry anybody except a woman similarly guilty, or a disbeliever (woman): Let not any such guilty woman marry anybody except a man similarly guilty or a disbeliever (man): But such a thing (marriage to the guilty or to the disbelievers) is forbidden to the believers (men and women)"
  24,4,"And those who start a charge against pure women, and do not have four witnesses (in support of the accusation)— Severely whip them with eighty stripes; And do not ever accept their testimony afterwards: Because such men are wicked transgressors—"

  24,6,"And for those who start a case (of adultery) against their wives, and do not have witnesses (in support) except their own (testimony)— (Then, the) only evidence (from such a man is) if he testifies (under oath) four times, by Allah that he is honestly saying the truth"
