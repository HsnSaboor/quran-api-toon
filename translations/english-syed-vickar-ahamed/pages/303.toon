quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  18,84,"Surely, We established his power on earth, and We gave him the ability to do everything"
  18,85,One (such) way he followed (to do)
  18,86,"Until, when he reached the setting place of the sun, he found it set in a pool of murky water: And near it he found a people: We said: \"O Zul-Qarnain! You either punish them or treat them with kindness"
  18,87,"He said: \"As to whoever does wrong, (only) him shall we punish; And then he shall be sent back to his Lord; And He will punish him (the wrong-doer) with severe punishment"
  18,88,"But as to whoever believes, and work righteousness— He shall have a good reward, and his task we (Zul-Qarnain) order will be easy by our command"
  18,89,Then he followed (another) way
  18,90,"Until, when he came to the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We (Allah) had provided no protection against the sun"
  18,91,"(He left them) as they were, (and) We completely understood what was before him"
  18,92,Then he followed (yet another) way
  18,93,"Until, when he reached (a valley) between two mountains, he found, beneath them, a (primitive) people who did not understand a word"
  18,94,"They said: \"O Zul-Qarnain! Verily, the Yajuj and Majuj (Gog and Magog) do great mischief on the earth: Shall we pay you the tribute and honor if you may build a wall between us and them"
  18,95,"He said: \"(The power) that my Lord has placed in me is better (than honor): So help me with strength (and work): I will build a strong wall between you and them"
  18,96,"Bring me blocks of iron;\" At length, when he had filled the space between the two steep mountain-sides, he said, \"Blow (with your bellows into the fire.)\" Then, when he had made them (red) as fire; He said: \"Bring me the molten lead, that I may pour over them"
  18,97,Thus they (Gog and Magog) were made helpless to climb it (the wall) or to dig through it
