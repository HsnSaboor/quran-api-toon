quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,32,"Those who were arrogant will say to those weak ones: \"Did we keep you back from Guidance (even) after it reached you? No! Instead, it was you were at fault"
  34,33,"Those who were the weak ones will say to the arrogant ones: \"No! It was a (your) plot by day and by night: When, you (always) ordered us to be thankless to Allah and to find (others) equal with Him!\" And they will say (their) repentance when they see the Penalty: And We shall put (stiff) clamps on the necks of the unbelievers: It would only be a repayment for their (ill) deeds"
  34,34,"And We never sent a warner to a (group in) town but the wealthy ones from them said: \"We do not believe in the (Message) with which you (the warner) have been sent with"
  34,35,"And they said: \"We have more in wealth and sons, and we are not going to be punished"
  34,36,"Say: \"Surely, my Lord gives more or less things to whom He pleases, but most men do not understand"
  34,37,"And it is not your wealth, nor your children, that will bring you (by the least bit) nearer to Us: But only those who believe and work righteousness— These are the ones for whom there is an increased Reward many times for their deeds, while they are safely placed in (the high home of) Paradise in peaceful bliss"
  34,38,"And those who work against Our Signs, to block and impede them, they will be put in punishment"
  34,39,"Say: \"Surely, my Lord gives more or less livelihood to those of His servants as He pleases: And there is nothing of what you spend in the least (for Him) that He does not replace it: And He is the Best of those to give livelihood (Khair-ur-Razikheen)"
