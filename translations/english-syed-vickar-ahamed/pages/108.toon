quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,6,"O you who believe! When you get ready for prayer, then wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) up to the elbows; Rub your head (with water); And wash your feet up to the ankles. If you are in a state of bodily impurity, (resulting from sexual contact,) bathe your whole body. But if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you have come from the offices of nature (i.e., toilet), or you have been in contact with women and you do not find water— Then take for yourself clean sand or earth, and rub your faces and hands with it. Allah does not wish to place you in difficulty, but to make you clean, and to complete His favor on you, that you may be thankful"
  5,7,"And remember the Favor of Allah on you, and His Promise, which He confirmed with you, when you said: \"We hear and we obey:\" And fear Allah, because Allah is All Knowing (Aleem) of the secrets of your breasts (hearts)"
  5,8,"O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allah, as just witness for just (and fair) dealing, and do not let the hatred of others to make you lean towards wrong and go away from Justice. Be just: That is next to Piety: And fear Allah, because Allah is Well-Acquainted (Khabeer) with all that you do"
  5,9,"Allah has promised to those who believe and act rightfully, forgiveness and a great reward"
