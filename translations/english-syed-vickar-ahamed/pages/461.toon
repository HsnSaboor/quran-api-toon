quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,"Is one whose breast Allah has opened to Islam, so that he has received the Light from his Lord, (not better than one whose heart is in disbelief)? (There is) grief for those whose hearts are hardened against saying the Praises of Allah! They are clearly walking about in error"
  39,23,"Allah has sent down (from time to time) the Most Beautiful Message, in the form of a Book, (the Scripture, this Quran) true within (and to) itself, (always) repeating (its teaching): The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver and tremble by (reading and hearing) it; Then their skins and their hearts soften by to the remembrance of Allah. Like this is the Guidance of Allah. He guides like this whom He pleases, but no one can guide those whom Allah leaves to wander about"
  39,24,"Then, is the one who has to fear the hurt of the penalty on the Day of Judgment (and receive it) on his face, (like one who is safe from it)? And it will be said to the wrongdoers: \"You taste (the fruits of) what you earned"
  39,25,(There were) those who rejected (the Message) before them and so (for them) the punishment came to them from directions they did not expect
  39,26,"So, Allah gave them a taste of hurt (and disgrace) in the present life, but the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew"
  39,27,"And indeed, in this Quran, We have put forth every kind of similar (and meaningful) story for men in order that they may be informed (and warned)"
  39,28,"(It is purely) a Quran in Arabic, without any (dishonesty or) crookedness in it: In order that they (those who read) may protect (themselves) against evil"
  39,29,"Allah puts forth a parable (the story with meaning and guidance in it)— A slave belonging to many different partners, (false gods) disputing with one another and a slave belonging only to one master : Are those two equal in comparison? All the Praises (and thanks) be to Allah! But most of them do not know"
  39,30,"Truly, you will die (one day), and truly they will also die (one day)"
  39,31,"Then in the End, you will (all) on the Day of Judgment, settle your disagreements in the Presence of your Lord"
