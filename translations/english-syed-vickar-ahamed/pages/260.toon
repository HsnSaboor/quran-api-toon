quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  14,34,"And He gives you from what you ask for. But if you count the mercies of Allah, you will never be able to number them. Truly, man is used to being unjust and ungrateful"
  14,35,"And (remember) Ibrahim (Abraham) said: \"O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah), one with Peace and security: And save me and my sons from praying to idols"
  14,36,"O my Lord! They (the idols) have truly led many among mankind astray; Then he who follows my (ways), surely he is of me, and he who disobeys me (is going astray)— But You are truly Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  14,37,"O our Lord! I have made some of my children to live in the valley without (any) cultivation to (be near) Your Sacred House (in Makkah); So that, O our Lord, they may establish regular Prayer: So fill the hearts of some from among men with love towards them, and feed them with fruits: So that they may offer thanks (to You)"
  14,38,"O our Lord! You truly know what we hide and what we reveal: For there is nothing that is hidden from Allah, either on earth or in heaven"
  14,39,"All the Praises (and thanks) be to Allah, Who has granted me in old age Ismail (Ishmael) and Ishaq (Isaac): Verily, my Lord is indeed the Hearer (As-Sami’) of prayer"
  14,40,"O my Lord! Make me one who establishes regular prayer, and (also make me raise such) from my children: O our Lord! And accept my prayer (and pleading)"
  14,41,"O our Lord! (Bestow us with Your) Forgiveness for— Me, my parents, and (all) believers, on the Day that the counting (of good and evil) will happen"
  14,42,Do not think that Allah does not care for the actions of the wrongdoers. But He (Allah) only gives them (a short time of) relief against a Day when the eyes will constantly stare in fear (of the punishment)—
