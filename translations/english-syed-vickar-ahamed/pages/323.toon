  21,11,"How many were the populations We have totally destroyed because of their injustices, and set up in their places other peoples"
  21,12,"Then, when they felt Our Punishment (coming), look, they (tried to) run away from it"
  21,13,"Do not run away, but come back to the good things of this life given to you, and to your homes, in order that you may be called to account"
  21,14,"They said: \"Oh! Woe unto us! (Misery to us)! Truly, we were wrongdoers"
  21,15,"And that cry of theirs did not stop, until We made them like a field to be cut (down) likes ashes silent and put out"
  21,16,And not for play did We create the heavens and earth and all that is between
  21,17,"If it had been Our wish to make a game, we should surely have made it from the things nearest to Us, if We would do (such a thing)"
  21,18,"No, We throw the truth against falsehood, and it (truth) destroys it (the falsehood), and look! Falsehood disappears! Oh! Misery be to you for the (false) things that you ascribe (to Us)"
  21,19,"And to Him belong all (creatures) in the heavens and on earth: And even those who are in His Presence are not too proud to worship Him, nor are they (ever) tired (of His service)"
  21,20,"They celebrate His praises night and day, nor do they ever get tired or slip"
  21,21,Or have they taken (other) gods from the earth who can raise the dead
  21,22,"In the heavens and the earth, if there were other gods besides Allah, there would have been ruin to both! But Glory to Allah, the Lord of the Throne: (High is He) above whatever they associate with Him"
  21,23,"He cannot be questioned for His actions, but they will be questioned (for theirs)"
  21,24,"Or have they taken for worship (other) gods besides Him? Say: \"Bring your clear proof: This is the Message of those with me and the Message of those before me.\" But most of them do not know the Truth, and so they turn away"
