quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,88,"The leaders, the proud group from among his people said: \"O Shu’aib! We shall really drive you out of our city— (You) and those who believe with you; Or else you (both) will have to return to our ways and religion.\" He said: \"What! Even though we (strongly) dislike (them)"
  7,89,"We should really make up a lie against Allah, if we returned to your religion after Allah has saved us from them; And we could not return to it by any way or means, unless it is in the Will and Plan of Allah, Our Lord. Our Lord can reach out to the deepest corners of things by His knowledge. In Allah Alone is our trust. Our Lord! You decide between us and our people in truth, because You are the Best to judge (Qha’ir-ul-Fateheen)"
  7,90,"The leaders of the disbelievers from his people, said to their people: \"If you follow Shu’aib, be sure then you will be the losers"
  7,91,"But the earthquake took them without warning, and they lay on their face in their homes before the morning"
  7,92,"The men who rejected Shu’aib became as if they had never been in the homes where the had grown up (in joy and happiness): The men who rejected Shu’aib— Were ruined"
  7,93,"(So Shu’aib) left them, saying: \"O my people! I really brought the Message to you for which I was sent by my Lord: I gave you good advice, but how shall I feel sad for people who refuse to believe"
  7,94,"And whenever We sent a prophet to a town (and they rejected him,) We helped its people in suffering and misfortune, so that they might learn humility"
  7,95,"Then We changed their suffering into success and joy, until they grew and multiplied, and began to say: \"Our fathers (too) had suffering and success\"— Look! We called them to account all of a sudden, when they were not aware (of the situation)"
