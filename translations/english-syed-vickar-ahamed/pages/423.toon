quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,"It is not right for a believer, man or woman, when something has been already judged by Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), to have any choice about the judgment: And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), he is indeed on a clearly wrong path"
  33,37,"And (remember) when (O Prophet)! You said to the person (Zaid) who had received the gift from Allah and your favor: \"You keep (the marriage with) your wife and fear Allah. But you did hide in your heart what Allah was about to make it clear: You did fear the people, but it is better that you fear Allah. So, when Zaid had dissolved (his marriage) with her, after the necessary (steps of divorce), We joined her in marriage with you: So, that there are no questions for the believers (regarding the) marriage with the wives of their adopted sons, after they have dissolved the marriage with the necessary (steps) with them (their ex-wives). And Allah’s (Divine) Order must be completed and fulfilled"
  33,38,There can be no blame for the Prophet in what Allah has made legal for him. It was done by those in the old and past days (and approved) by Allah; And the Command of Allah is a decision made
  33,39,"(And for) those who convey the Messages of Allah, and fear Him and fear no one but Allah. And Allah is enough to bring (men) to account (Hasib)"
  33,40,"Muhammad (the Prophet) is not the father of any (one) of your men, but (he is) a Messenger of Allah, and the Seal (at the end) of the prophets. And Allah is All Knowing (Aleem) of all things"
  33,41,"O you who believe! Remember (and Glorify Allah), and do this (deeply and a great) many times"
  33,42,"And Glorify Him (with Praise), morning and afternoon"
  33,43,"It is He Who sends blessings upon you like His angels do, so that He may take you out from depths of darkness into Light: And verily, He is Full of Mercy (Raheem) for the believers"
