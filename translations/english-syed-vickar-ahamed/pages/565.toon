quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  68,16,Soon shall We brand (the beast) on the nose
  68,17,"Surely, We have tried them as We tried the People of the Garden, when they swore to pluck the fruits of the (garden) in the morning"
  68,18,"But made no reservation, (by saying: \"Insha-Allah\", or \"If Allah Wills it)"
  68,19,"Then there came on the (garden) a visitation from your Lord, (which swept away) all around while they were asleep"
  68,20,"So the (garden) became, by the morning, like a dark desolate spot (whose fruit had been gathered)"
  68,21,"As the morning broke, they called out, one to another—"
  68,22,"Saying: \"You go to your garden early in the morning, if you were to gather the fruits"
  68,23,"And so they departed, conversing in secret low tones, (saying)"
  68,24,Let not a single needy person break in upon you into the (garden) this day
  68,25,"And they opened the morning, strong in an (unjust) claim"
  68,26,"But when they saw the (garden) they said: \"We have surely lost our way"

  68,29,"They said: \"Glory to our Lord! Surely, we have been doing wrong"
  68,30,"Then they turned, one against another, in blame"
  68,31,"They said: \"Woe be unto us! We have indeed exceeded our limits"
  68,32,"It may be that our Lord will give us in exchange a better (garden) than this: Truly, we do turn to Him (in repentance)"
  68,33,"Such is the punishment (in this life); But surely, greater is the Punishment in the Hereafter— If only they knew"
  68,34,"Surely, for the righteous, are the Gardens of Delight, in the Presence of their Lord"
  68,35,Shall We then treat the people of faith like (We treat) the criminals (and the peoples of sin)
  68,36,What is the matter with you? How can you judge
  68,37,Or do you have a Book through which you learn—
  68,38,"That you shall have, through it whatever you choose"
  68,39,"Or have you promises with Us on oath reaching to the Day of Judgment, (providing) that you shall have whatever you shall demand"
  68,40,"You ask of them, which of them will stand guarantee for that"
  68,41,"Or have they some (false) ‘partners’ (in godhead referring the Nasrani’s idle notion of trinity)? Then let them produce their ‘partners’, if they are truthful"
  68,42,"The Day that when the Shin (Allah’s Divine Self) shall be laid bare, and they shall be summoned to prostrate themselves but they (the hypocrites) shall not be able to do so—"
