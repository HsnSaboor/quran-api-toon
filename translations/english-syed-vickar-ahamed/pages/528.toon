quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,And that He created in pairs— Male and female
  53,46,From a seed when placed (finally in the womb)
  53,47,And that He has promised a second Creation (by raising the dead at Resurrection)
  53,48,And that it is He Who gives wealth and satisfaction
  53,49,"That He is the Lord of Sirius (Shi'ra, the Mighty Star in the constellation of Canis Major)"
  53,50,And that it is He Who destroyed the (powerful) 'Ad (people) of the old
  53,51,"And the Samood (Thamud), and (He) did not grant them an eternal life"
  53,52,"And before them, the people of Nuh (Noah) because they were (all) most unjust and most arrogant (people) exceeding their limits"
  53,53,And He destroyed the defeated Cities (of Sodom and Gomorrah)
  53,54,So that (soil and debris) have covered them up
  53,55,Then which of the gifts of your Lord (O man) will you question
  53,56,"This is a warner (the Prophet), from the (number of) warners of old"
  53,57,The (Judgment) ever approaching comes nearer
  53,58,"None besides Allah, can alter (the timing of) it"
  53,59,"Then, do you wonder at (the recitation of) this message"
  53,60,And will you laugh and not weep—
  53,61,Wasting your time in useless things
  53,62,"But you fall down in prostration to Allah, and (adoringly) worship (Him)"
  54,1,"The Hour (of Judgment) has drawn nearer, and the moon has been torn apart (cleft asunder)"
  54,2,"And if they see a Sign they turn away, and say: \"This is persistent magic"
  54,3,They reject (the warning) and follow their (own) desires and every matter has its appointed time
  54,4,"And indeed there have already come to them, recitations in which there is (enough) warning"
  54,5,Perfect wisdom (in this Quran)— But (the preaching of) warners does not profit them
  54,6,"Therefore, (O Prophet,) turn away from them. The Day when the Caller will call (them) to a terrible affair"
