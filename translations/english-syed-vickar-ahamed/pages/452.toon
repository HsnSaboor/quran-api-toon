quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you? How do you decide
  37,155,Then will you not remember (receive the warning)
  37,156,Or do you have a clear authority
  37,157,"(If so), then you bring your Book (of authority) if you are truthful"
  37,158,"And they have invented a blood-relationship between Him and the jinns', but the jinns' know (very well) that they (also) have to appear (for Judgment)"
  37,159,Glorified be Allah! (He is) Free from the things that they relate (to Him)
  37,160,"Except those slaves of Allah, whom He chooses"
  37,161,"So surely, neither you nor those you worship—"
  37,162,Can lead (any of Allah’s servents) into temptation (and lies) about Allah
  37,163,Except those who are (by themselves) going to the blazing Fire (of Hell)
  37,164,"(Those angels arranged in ranks to serve Allah say): \"Not even one of us does not have a place appointed"
  37,165,"And, verily we are surely arranged in ranks (for Allah’s Service)"
  37,166,And surely we are those who speak out (Allah’s Supreme) Glory
  37,167,And indeed they (the pagan Arabs) used to say
  37,168,If only we have had a Message before us from those (Books) of old
  37,169,"We would truly have been the Servants of Allah, sincere (and loving)"
  37,170,"But (now that the Quran has come), they (still) reject it: But soon will they know (the penalty)"
  37,171,"And surely, Our Word, already has been given before (this) to Our servants and messengers sent"
  37,172,That they would certainly be made victorious
  37,173,"And that Our forces— Surely, they would the be victors"
  37,174,So you (O Prophet!) turn away from them for a little while
  37,175,"And watch them (how they will do), and they shall soon see (how you do)"
  37,176,Do they really want to hurry Our punishment
  37,177,Then when it (the punishment) falls into the open space before them; Painful will be the morning for those who were warned (but did not pay attention)
  37,178,So you turn away from them for a little while
  37,179,"And watch them (how they will do), and they shall soon see (how you do)"
  37,180,"Glorified be your Lord, the Lord of Honor and Power! (He is free) from the things that they relate (to Him)"
  37,181,And Peace (be) on the messengers (of Allah)
  37,182,"And all the Praises (and thanks) to Allah, the Lord (and Cherisher) of the Worlds (Rab-Al-'Ala'meen)"
