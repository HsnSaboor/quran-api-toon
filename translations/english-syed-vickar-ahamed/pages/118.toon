quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,58,And when you recite your call to prayer they take it as a joke without (any) seriousness that is because they are a people without understanding
  5,59,"(To such people) say: \"O People of the Book! Do you disapprove of us for no reason other than that we believe in Allah, and the Message that has come to us and that which has come before (us), and (perhaps) because most of you rebel and disobey"
  5,60,"Say (to them): \"Shall I point out something to you much worse than this, (judging) by the treatment it received from Allah? Those who received the curse from Allah and His anger, those (are the people) of whom some He transformed into apes and swine, those who worshipped Evil and false gods— These are (much) worse in rank, and far more astray from the even Path"
  5,61,"When they come to you, they say: \"We believe:\" But in reality they enter with a mind (set) against Faith, and they go out with the same (mind). But Allah knows completely all that they hide"
  5,62,"Many of them you do see, competing with each other in sin and hate, and eating from things forbidden. Indeed! Evil are the things that they do"
  5,63,Why do not the Rabbis and the Doctors of (Judaic) Law prevent them (such people) from their (habit of) saying sinful words and eating things forbidden? Evil indeed are their works
  5,64,"The Jews say: \"Allah’s hand is tied up.\" Be (it is) their hands (that are) tied up and (let) them be cursed for the (lies) they say (against Allah!). No! Both His hands are widely stretched out: He gives and spends as He pleases. Surely, the Message that comes to you from Allah increases in many of them, their rebellion and disbelief (against Allah). Among them We have placed opposition and hatred till the Day of Judgment. Every time they light a fire for war, Allah extinguishes it: But they (always) work hard in doing mischief on earth. And Allah does not love those who do mischief"
