quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  51,52,"Like this, no messenger came to the peoples before them, but they said (of him) in like manner, an (evil) magician, or a madman"
  51,53,"Is this the teaching they have transmitted, one to another? No! They are themselves a people breaking beyond (their) bounds"
  51,54,"So turn away from them: Yours is not the blame"
  51,55,And remind (the message) truly teaching the benefits (of the Quran) to the believers
  51,56,"And I (Allah) have only created jinns' and men, that they may worship (and serve) Me"
  51,57,"No sustenance do I require from them, nor do I require that they should feed Me"
  51,58,"Verily, Allah is the All Providing (Al-Raziq) of the provision— Lord of Power— Supreme, the Almighty (Al-Matin)—"
  51,59,"And verily, for the wrongdoers, their portion (of punishment) is like the portion of their fellows (of earlier generations): Then let them not ask Me to hasten (that portion)"
  51,60,"Misery, then, to the unbelievers, on account of that Day of theirs which they have been promised"
  52,1,By (the Mountain of) Thr
  52,2,And by the Book inscribed (and is carved out)
  52,3,In a scroll (that is left open) unfolded
  52,4,And by the frequently visited Place of Worship (the mosque for angels above Ka’bah)
  52,5,And by the sky raised high
  52,6,And by the ocean that fills with waves—
  52,7,"Surely, the (severe) penalty from your Lord will really come true—"
  52,8,There is no one who can change it—
  52,9,On the Day when the sky will swing in terrible fear
  52,10,And the mountains will fly here and there
  52,11,"Then woe (fear and misery), that Day to those (people) who treat (Truth) as falsehood"
  52,12,Those (people) who play (and indulge) in small and silly talk
  52,13,"That Day when they shall be pushed down to the Fire of Hell, without any questions (being asked)"
  52,14,"This,\" (it will be said:) \"Is the Fire— Which you habitually deny"
