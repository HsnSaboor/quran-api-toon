quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,82,"And his people did not answer except this: They said: \"Drive them out of your city: These are men who want to be clean and pure from sins"
  7,83,"But We saved him and his family, except his wife: She was of those who lagged behind"
  7,84,"And We rained on them a shower (of brimstone): See then, what was the end of those who practiced sin and crime"
  7,85,"To the Madyan people, We sent Shu’aib, one of their own brothers: He said: \"O my people! Worship Allah; You have no other god except Him. Surely, a clear (Sign) has come to you from your Lord! Give just (and proper) measure and weight, and do not keep away from the people the things that are their due; And do not do mischief in the land after it has been put in order: That will be best for you, if you have Faith"
  7,86,"And do not sit on every road, saying threats, blocking from the Path of Allah those who believe in Him and searching for something crooked in it; Remember how you were a few and He gave you increase. And hold in you mind's eye what was the end of those who did mischief"
  7,87,"And if there is a group (of people) from you who believes in the Message with which I have been sent, and a group which does not believe, keep yourselves in patience till Allah decides between us: For He is the best to decide (Qha’ir-ul-Hakeemin)"
