quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,78,"And indeed, We did send messengers before you: Of them there are some whose story We have told you and some whose story We have not told you, and it was not (possible) for any messenger to bring a Sign except by the Permission of Allah: But when the Order of Allah was given, the matter was decided in truth and justice, and those who stood on falsehoods were destroyed to be lost"
  40,79,"Allah! It is He Who has made cattle for you, that you may ride on some of them, and some of them for food"
  40,80,"And, for you there are many other benefits in them (the cattle) and that you may use them for any need that (there may be) in your hearts; And on them and on ships (that) you are carried"
  40,81,"And He (always) shows you His Signs: Which, then of the Signs of Allah will you reject"
  40,82,"Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the end of those before them? They were more in number than them and (even) stronger in might and in the traces (they have left behind) in the land: Yet all that they did was of no use to them"
  40,83,"Then when their messengers came to them with clear proofs and evidences, they were only happy (and proud) with the knowledge (and worldly things) that they had; And that very (suffering) at which they used to mock surrounded them"
  40,84,"So when they saw Our Punishment, they said: \"We believe in Allah— the One Allah— And we reject all the partners we used to enjoin with Him"
  40,85,"Then their accepting the Faith after they (actually) saw Our Punishment was not going to help them. (Such has been) Allah’s Way of dealing with His servants, (from the oldest of times). And the rejecters of Allah were (totally) destroyed (in the Punishment)"
