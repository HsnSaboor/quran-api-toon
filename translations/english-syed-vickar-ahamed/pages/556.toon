quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  64,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth, glorifies of Allah: His is the (entire) Dominion, and to Him belongs all the Praise (and thanks) and He is Able (Khadir) to do all things"
  64,2,"It is He, Who has created you; Some of you are unbelievers, and some of you are believers: And Allah is All Seeing (Baseer) of all that you do"
  64,3,"He has created the heavens and the earth in proper proportions, and has given you shape, and made your shapes beautiful: And to Him is the final return"
  64,4,"He knows what is in the heavens and (what is) on earth; And He knows what you hide and what you reveal: And Allah is All Knower (Aleem) of what (secret) lies in the breasts (and hearts of men)"
  64,5,"Has the story not reached you, of the disbelievers before you? And so they tasted the evil result of their conduct; And they had a painful penalty"
  64,6,"That was because messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they said: \"Shall (mere) human beings direct us?\" So they rejected (the Message) and turned away. But Allah is Free (Ghani) of all Needs, worthy of all Praise (Hameed)"
  64,7,"The unbelievers think that they will not be raised up (for Judgment), say: \"O Yes! By my Lord, you shall surely be raised up: Then shall you be told (the truth) of all that you did, and that is easy for Allah"
  64,8,"Therefore, believe in Allah and His Messenger, and in the Light that We have sent down. And Allah is All Aware (Khabir) of all that you do"
  64,9,"The Day when He assembles you (all) for a Day of Assembly— That will be a day of mutual loss and gain (among you), and (for) those who believe in Allah and do righteous deeds— He will remove from them their sorrows, and He will admit them to Gardens beneath rivers flow, to live in there forever: That will be the supreme achievement"
