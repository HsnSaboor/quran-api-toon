quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  16,73,"And they (the idolaters) worship other than Allah— Such as have no power to provide them, anything in heavens or on earth for life, and cannot possibly have any such power"
  16,74,"So, do not make up similitude for Allah: Truly, Allah knows and you do not know"
  16,75,"Allah brings forward the case (of two men: One) a slave under the control of another; He (the slave) has no power at all; And (the other) a man upon whom We have granted many good favors from Ourselves, and he spends from them (freely), privately and publicly: Then are the two equal? All the Praises (and thanks) be to Allah. But most of them do not understand"
  16,76,"And Allah brings forward (another) case of two men: One of them dumb, with no power of any type, he is a tiresome burden on his master; Wherever he (master) directs him (the dumb one), he brings no good: Is such a man equal to one who acts justly, and is on the Straight Path"
  16,77,"And the Mystery of the heavens and of the earth belongs to Allah. And the Decision of the Hour (of Judgment) is as (quick as) the wink of an eye, or even closer: Truly, Allah is Able (Khadir) to do (and has Power over) all things"
  16,78,"And it is He Who brought you out from the wombs of your mothers when you did not know anything; And He gave you hearing, sight, and hearts (for understanding and love): So that you may give thanks (to Him)"
  16,79,"Do they not see the birds, held balanced in the middle of the sky? Nothing holds them up except (the Power of) Allah. Surely, in this are Signs (verses) for those who believe"
