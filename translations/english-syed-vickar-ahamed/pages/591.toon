quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the sky (the heaven) and by the Visitor by the night
  86,2,And what will explain to you what is the Visitor by the night —
  86,3,The shinning Star of intense brightness—
  86,4,There is no soul without a Protector over it
  86,5,"Now, let man only think from what he is created"
  86,6,He is created from a drop emitted—
  86,7,Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs
  86,8,Surely (Allah) is able to bring him back (to life)
  86,9,The Day that (all) things secret will be tested
  86,10,(Man) will have no power and no helper
  86,11,By the sky that returns (with rains again and again)
  86,12,And by the earth which opens out (for the gushing springs or the budding plants)—
  86,13,Watch! This is the Word that separates out (Good from evil)
  86,14,It is not a thing for amusement
  86,15,"As for them (the disbelievers), they are only plotting a scheme"
  86,16,And I am planning a Scheme
  86,17,"Therefore (O Prophet!) give a little time for the disbelievers: Bear with them gently (for a while)"
  87,1,"Praise (and Glorify) the Name of your Lord, the Most High (Rab-Al-A'la)"
  87,2,"Who has created, and given form and proper size"
  87,3,Who has prescribed laws (to live by) and given you guidance (in His Books)
  87,4,And Who grows the (green and rich) pasture
  87,5,And then makes it dry and stalky (with grain)
  87,6,"By small amounts We shall teach you (O Prophet!) To declare (the Message), so that you shall not forget"
  87,7,Except as Allah wills for He knows what is openly known and what is hidden
  87,8,And We will make it easy for you (to follow) the simple (Path)
  87,9,Therefore give guidance in case the guidance will profit (the listener)
  87,10,The guidance will be received by those who fear (Allah)
  87,11,But it will be avoided by those most unfortunate ones
  87,12,Who will enter the great Fire
  87,13,In which they will neither die nor live
  87,14,"But those will prosper, who purify themselves"
  87,15,And praise the Name of their Guardian-Lord and (purify their hearts) in prayer
