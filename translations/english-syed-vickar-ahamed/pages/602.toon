quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,For the agreements (promises) of security and safeguard (enjoyed) by Quraish
  106,2,Their agreements (covering) journeys by winter and summer—
  106,3,Let them adore the Lord of this House
  106,4,"(The One) Who provides them with food against hunger, and with security against fear (of danger)"
  107,1,Do you see the one who denies the Judgment (to come)
  107,2,"Then, it is such a (man) who repels (and discards) the orphan (with harshness)"
  107,3,And does not encourage the feeding of the needy
  107,4,"So, (this is a) warning to the worshippers"
  107,5,Who are neglectful of their prayers
  107,6,Those who (only want) to be seen (by men)
  107,7,But refuse (to offer even) the neighborly needs
  108,1,To you (O Prophet!) We have granted the Fountain (of Abundance)
  108,2,Therefore turn to your Lord in prayer and sacrifice
  108,3,Because he who hates you— He will be cut off (from the hope of the future)
