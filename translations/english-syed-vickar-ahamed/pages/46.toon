quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,270,"And whatever you spend in charity or in love, be sure Allah knows it all. But the wrongdoers have no helpers"
  2,271,"You may mention the (acts of) charity, however, it is better, if you do not talk about them, and make them reach those (who are really) in need: That is best for you; It will remove from you some of your (stains of) evil. And Allah is well Informed (Khabeer) of what you do"
  2,272,"It is not required for you (O Prophet!), to set them on the right path, but Allah sets on the right path anyone He pleases. Whatever good you give benefits your own souls, and you shall only do so hoping for the (Divine) Face of Allah. Whatever good you give, shall be brought back to you and you shall not be dealt with unjustly"
  2,273,"(Charity is) for those in need, those in Allah’s cause are restricted (from travel), and cannot move about in the land, searching (for work). The ones may without knowing think, Because of their modesty that they are free from want. You shall know them by their (constant) habit: They do not beg openly from all and everyone. And whatever good you give, be sure Allah knows it well"
  2,274,"Those (who in charity) spend of their goods by night and day, in secret and in public, have their reward with their Lord: On them shall there be no fear, and they shall not grieve"
