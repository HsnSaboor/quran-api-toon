quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,71,"You People of the Book! Why do you cover truth with falsehood, and hide the Truth, when you have knowledge"
  3,72,"And a party of the People of the Book say: \"Believe in the morning in what is revealed to the believers, and reject it at the end of the day; That by chance they may (themselves) turn back"
  3,73,"And believe no one except the one who follows your religion.\" Say: \"The True guidance is the Guidance of Allah: (Be sure) that a revelation may be sent to someone (else) like that which was sent to you: Or that those (receiving such revelation) should argue with you before your Lord?\" Say: \"All bounties are in the hands of Allah: He grants them to whom He pleases: And Allah is Enough (Wasi’), All Knowing (Aleem)"
  3,74,"For His Mercy, He specially chooses whom He pleases; For Allah is the Bestower of greatest bounties"
  3,75,"And among the People of the Book are some who, if entrusted with a large amounts of gold, will readily pay it back; Others, who, if entrusted with a single silver coin, will not repay it unless you constantly stand demanding, because, they say, \"There is no duty on us (to keep faith) with these ignorant (pagans).\" But they tell a lie against Allah, and they know it well"
  3,76,"Yes! Those who keep their true faith and act right— Surely, Allah loves those who act righteously"
  3,77,"Verily, those who sell their faith for a small price, they owe to Allah and their own true word; They shall have no portion in the Hereafter: And Allah will not (find it worthy to) speak to them nor to look at them on the Day of Judgment, nor will He clean them (of sin): They shall have a painful Penalty"
