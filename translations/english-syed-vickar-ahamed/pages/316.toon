quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  20,65,"They said; \"O Musa (Moses)! Either you be the one who throws (first) or will we be the first to throw"
  20,66,"He said: \"No, you throw first!\" Then look, their ropes and their rods— So it appeared to him, because of their magic— Began to be in life-like movement"
  20,67,"So Musa (Moses), in his mind had a (sort of) fear"
  20,68,"We (Allah) said: \"Fear not! Because you truly have the upper hand"
  20,69,"And throw that which is in your right hand: quickly it will swallow up what they have faked (and) what they have faked is only a magicians trick: And the magician does not succeed, wherever he may go or whatever skill he may attain"
  20,70,"So the magicians were laid down to prostration: They said: \"We believe in the Lord of Haroon (Aaron) and Musa (Moses)"
  20,71,"(Pharaoh) said: \"(Will) you believe in Him before I give you permission? Surely, this must be your leader, who has taught you (your) magic! Be sure I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will have you crucified on the trunk of palm—trees: So that you will know for sure (about), which of us can give the more severe and longer lasting punishment"
  20,72,"They said: \"We will never consider you as more than the Clear Signs that have come to us, or (more) than Him Who created us! So order whatever you want to order: Because you can only order (about things in) the life of this world"
  20,73,"Verily, for us, we have believed in our Lord (Rab): That He (Allah) may forgive us our mistakes, and the magic which you forced us (to perform): And Allah is Best (Kha’ir, One for rewards) and (Allah is) Most Enduring (Ba’qi)"
  20,74,"Surely he who comes to his Lord as a criminal (at Judgment), for him is Hell: In there he will neither die nor live"
  20,75,But those who come to Him as believers who have worked righteous deeds— For them are supreme ranks—
  20,76,"Gardens of Eternity, under which flow rivers; They will live in there for ever: Like this is the reward for those who purify themselves (of evil)"
