quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,51,"O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians as protectors: They are only protectors to each other. And he from yourselves who turns to them (for friendship) is (one) of them. Surely Allah does not guide unjust people"
  5,52,"(And) those (people) in whose hearts is a disease— Do you see how eagerly they run about among themselves, saying: \"We do fear that a change of fortune will bring us ruin.\" Oh! Perhaps Allah will give you victory, or a decision according to His Will, then they will feel sorry for the thoughts that they secretly kept in their hearts"
  5,53,"And, those who believe will say: \"Are these, the (very) men who made their strongest promises by Allah, that they were with you?\" All that they do will be useless, and they will fall into (nothing) but ruin"
  5,54,"O you who believe! (In case) any from among you turns back from his Faith (in Islam, be sure that), soon Allah will produce a people whom He will love as they will love Him— (People who are) humble with the believers, strong against the Rejecters (of Faith) fighting in the Way (the Cause) of Allah, and never afraid of the (unpleasant) words from those who find fault. That is the Grace of Allah, which He will bestow on whom He pleases. And Allah is All Encompassing and Sufficient (Wasi’), All Knowing (Aleem)"
  5,55,"Your (real) protector (and helper) is Allah, His Prophet (Muhammad), and the (company of) believers— Those who perform regular prayer and (give) regular charity and they bow down humbly (in prayer to Allah)"
  5,56,"As to those who turn (for friendship) to Allah, His Messenger (Muhammad), and the (company of) believers for protection— It is the party of Allah that must certainly be victorious (over everything)"
  5,57,"O you who believe! Do not take for (friends and) protectors those who take your religion as a joke or (take it) lightly— Whether (they are) among those who have received the Scripture before you, or among those who reject Faith; But you (who believe) fear Allah, if you (really) have Faith"
