quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"And when they listen to the Message received by the Messenger (Muhammad), you will see their eyes overflowing with tears, because they recognize (and see) the truth: They pray: \"Our Lord! We believe; Write us down among the witnesses"
  5,84,"What cause can we have not to believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us, seeing that we lovingly want for our Lord to admit us to the company of the righteous"
  5,85,"And for this (and) their prayer, Allah has rewarded them with Gardens, with rivers flowing below— Their lasting Home. Such is the reward of those who do good"
  5,86,But those who reject Faith and make lies about Our Signs— They shall be Companions of Hell-fire
  5,87,"O you who believe! Do not make unlawful the good things that Allah has made lawful for you, but do not overdo (anything or be excessive): For Allah does not love those who overdo (as a habit)"
  5,88,"Eat from the lawful and good things that Allah has provided for you, but fear Allah, in Whom you believe"
  5,89,"Allah will not ask you to account for what is unintentional in your oath; But He will ask you to account for your deliberate oath: To make up (in such cases), feed ten needy persons, on a scale of the average food of your families; Or clothe them; Or give a slave his freedom. If that is beyond your means, fast for three days. That is to make up (or compensate) for the oath you have sworn. But keep to your oath, like this Allah does make clear to you His Signs, that you may be thankful"
