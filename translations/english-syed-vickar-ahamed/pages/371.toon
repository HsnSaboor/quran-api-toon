quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,And give me honorable saying on the tongue of truth of the later (generations) to come
  26,85,And make me one of the inheritors of the Garden of (Eternal) Joy (the Paradise)
  26,86,"And forgive my father, verily, he is among those who go astray"
  26,87,"And let me not be in disgrace on the Day when (men) will be raised up;\"—"
  26,88,The Day when neither wealth nor sons will be of (any) use
  26,89,Except only he who brings to Allah a good heart (will be treated well)
  26,90,The Garden will be brought near to the righteous
  26,91,And the Fire will be placed in full sight to those lost in evil
  26,92,"And it shall be said to them: \"Where are the (gods that) you worshipped—"
  26,93,Besides Allah? Can they help you or help themselves
  26,94,Then they will be cast right into the (Fire)— They and those lost in evil
  26,95,And the whole groups from (the race of) Satan altogether
  26,96,"They will say, while they quarrel in there"
  26,97,"‘By Allah, truly, we were in a clear error"
  26,98,‘When we held you (Satan) as equal to the Lord of the Worlds (Rab-ul-'Ala'meen)
  26,99,"‘And none has led us astray except those who were criminals, (deeply) soaked in sin"
  26,100,"‘Then, we have none to intercede (for us) now"
  26,101,‘Nor a close single friend to feel (sorry for us now)
  26,102,"Now if we only had a chance to return, we shall truly be of those who believe!’"
  26,103,Surely in this is a Sign but most of them do not believe
  26,104,"And surely your Lord is He (Who is) the Almighty (Al-Aziz), the Most Merciful (Ar-Raheem)"
  26,105,The people of Nuh (Noah) denied the messengers
  26,106,"When their brother Nuh (Noah) said to them: \"Will you not fear and obey (Allah, in total trust or Taq'wa)"
  26,107,I am to you a messenger fit for all trust
  26,108,"So fear Allah, and obey me"
  26,109,"I do not ask for any reward for it from you: My reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds"
