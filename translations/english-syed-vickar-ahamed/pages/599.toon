quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  98,8,"Their reward is with Allah: Gardens of Eternity, beneath which rivers flow; They will live in there for ever; Allah well pleased with them, and they (well pleased) with Him: All this (is) for such as (those who) fear their Lord and Cherisher"
  99,1,When the earth is shaken to her (deepest) Convulsion
  99,2,And the earth throws up her burdens (from within)
  99,3,"And man cries (out in great pain): \"What is the matter with her"
  99,4,On that Day will she (the earth) declare her news
  99,5,"For that (Day), your (Mighty) Lord will have given her (the earth) His (Allah's) Order"
  99,6,"On that Day will men proceed in groups sorted out, to be shown the deeds that they (had done)"
  99,7,"Then anyone who has done an atoms weight of good, Shall see it"
  99,8,"And anyone who has done an atom’s weight of evil, Shall see it"
  100,1,By the (majestic horses) that run with panting (breath)
  100,2,And strike sparks of fire
  100,3,And raid (the enemy camp) with force in the morning
  100,4,And raise the dust in clouds (for) the while
  100,5,And penetrate straight in the middle (of enemies) in formation—
  100,6,"Truly, man is ungrateful to his (Almighty) Lord"
  100,7,"And to that (fact), he bears witness (by his deeds)"
  100,8,And violent is he in his love for wealth
  100,9,Does he not know— That when whatever is in the graves is thrown about
