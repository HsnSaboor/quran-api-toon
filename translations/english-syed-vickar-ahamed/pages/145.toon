quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,132,"For all (men, there) are degrees (or ranks) set by their deeds: And your Lord is not unmindful of anything that they do"
  6,133,"And your Lord is Self-Sufficient (Ghani), Full of Mercy: If He (so) wills, He can destroy you, and in your place appoint whom He wills as your successors, (or) even as He had raised you up as the descendants of other people"
  6,134,"Surely, all that has been promised to you will come out as true: Nor can you stop it (in the least bit)"
  6,135,"Say: \"O my people! Do whatever you can: I will do (my part): Soon will you know who they are whose end will be (the best) in the Hereafter: It is certain that the wrongdoers will not succeed"
  6,136,"And out of what Allah has produced in plenty as crops and as cattle, they assigned Him a share: And they say, according to their wish: \"This is for Allah, and this— For Our ‘partners’!\" But the share of their ‘partners’ does not reach Allah, whereas, the share of Allah reaches their ‘partners’! Evil (and unjust) is how they judge"
  6,137,"Even so, in the eyes of most of the (unbelieving) pagans, their ‘partners’ made the killing of their (own) children look nice, in order to lead them to their own destruction, and cause confusion in their religion. If Allah had willed, they would not have done so: But leave them and their inventions alone"
