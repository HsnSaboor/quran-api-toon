quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  29,46,"And you do not argue (or dispute) with the People of the Book, except with better ways (reasons and facts); Unless it is with those of them who cause injustice (or injury): But say (to them), \"We believe in the Revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; Our God (Allah) and your God is One; And it is to Him we bow (in Islam)"
  29,47,"And like this We have sent down the Book to you. So that the People of the Book believe in it, as some of these (pagan Arabs) also believe: And no one but unbelievers reject Our Signs"
  29,48,"And you were not (able) to say (and recite) a Book before this (Book came), and you are not (able) to write it with your right hand: Truly, if that was the case, the idle talkers would have doubted"
  29,49,"No! These are the clear and firm Signs that are in the hearts of those gifted with knowledge: And no one but the unjust reject Our Signs"
  29,50,"And yet they say: \"Why are not Signs sent down to him from his Lord?\" (O Prophet!) Say: \"The Signs are truly with Allah: And I am indeed a clear Warner"
  29,51,"And is it not enough for them that We have sent down to you the Book that has been told (and given) to them? Surely, in it is Mercy and a Reminder to those who believe"
  29,52,"Say: \"Allah is enough as a witness between me and you: He Knows what is in the heavens and on earth. And those who believe in show and falsehood and reject Allah, it is they who will be the losers"
