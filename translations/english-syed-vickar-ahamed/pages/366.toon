quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  25,68,"And those who do not call, with Allah, any other god, and do not kill the life which Allah has made sacred, except for honest cause, and do not commit adultery— And any who does this (the evil acts) shall get the penalty"
  25,69,"(And even) the penalty on the Day of Judgment will be doubled to him, and he will live in there with dishonor.—"
  25,70,"Unless he repents, believes, and does rightful acts, because Allah will change the evil of such persons into good deeds, and Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  25,71,And whoever repents and does good has truly turned to Allah with a (true) change (towards righteousness)—
  25,72,"Those who do not testify to lies, and if they come by useless (things), they avoid it with honor"
  25,73,"And those who, when they are warned by the Signs of their Lord, do not sink down (low) at them as if they were deaf or blind"
  25,74,"And those who pray, \"Our Lord! Give to us wives and children who will be the comfort of our eyes, and give us (the grace) to lead the righteous"
  25,75,"Those are the ones who will be rewarded with the highest place (in Paradise), because of their patient constancy: Therein they will be met with welcome and with words of peace and respect"
  25,76,Living in there— How beautiful a home and place of rest
  25,77,"Say (to the disbelievers): “My Lord does not care for you if you do not pray to Him: But you have in fact rejected (Him), and soon will come the inescapable (punishment)!”"
