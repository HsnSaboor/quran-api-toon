quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"(Ibrahim) said: \"Then for what purpose have you have come, O messengers"
  51,32,"They said, \"We have been sent to a people who are criminals in (deep sin)—"
  51,33,"To bring on, on them, (a shower of) stones of clay (brimstones)"
  51,34,Marked as from the Lord for those who trespass beyond bounds
  51,35,Then We safely removed those of the believers who were there
  51,36,But We did not find there any just (believing) persons except in one house
  51,37,And We have left there a Sign for those who may fear the painful penalty
  51,38,"And in (Musa was another Sign) when We sent him to Firon (Pharaoh), with clear authority"
  51,39,"But (Firon) turned back with his Chiefs, and said, \"An (evil) magician, or a madman"
  51,40,"So We took him and his forces, and threw them into the sea; And the blame was his"
  51,41,"And in the ‘Ad (people, is another Sign): We sent against them the devastating Wind"
  51,42,It left nothing whatever that it came up against. But reduced it to ruin and decay
  51,43,"And in the Samood (Thamud) people (was another sign): They were told, \"Enjoy (your brief day) for a little while"
  51,44,"But they angrily defied the Command of their Lord: So the stunning and destructive noise (of an earthquake) caught them, even while they were looking on"
  51,45,"Then they could not even stand (on their feet), nor could they help themselves"
  51,46,"So were the people of Nuh (Noah) before them: Verily, they wickedly exceeded all limits"
  51,47,"With Power (and Skill) did We construct the (mighty Arch of the) heaven : Verily, We are Who create the vastness of space with it"
  51,48,"And We have spread out the (spacious) earth: How excellently We do spread out"
  51,49,"And of everything We have created pairs: That you may remember and receive guidance"
  51,50,"So hasten you then (at once) to Allah: Verily, from Him, I am a Warner to you, clear and open"
  51,51,"And make no other object of worship with (Almighty) Allah: Verily, from Him, I am a Warner to you, clear and open"
