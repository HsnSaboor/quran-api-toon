quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,75,"And what is wrong with you (believers) not to fight in the cause of Allah, those (believers) who, are weak, the ill-treated (and oppressed)? Men, women, and children, the cry is: \"Our Lord! Rescue us from this town, whose people are oppressors; And from You give us a guardian who will protect; And from You give us one who will help"
  4,76,"Those who believe, fight in the cause of Allah and those who reject Faith (and) fight in the cause of Evil: So you fight against the friends of Satan: Weak indeed is the cunning of Satan"
  4,77,"Have you not looked at those who were told to hold back their hands (from fight) but establish regular prayers and spend in regular Charity? When (at last) the order to fight was issued to them, look! A section of them feared men as— Or even more than— They would have feared Allah: They said: \"Our Lord! Why have You ordered us to fight? Would You not grant us the delay (of death) to our (natural) term, near (enough)?\"— Say: \"Short is the enjoyment of this world: The Hereafter is the best for those who do right: Never will you be dealt with unjustly in the very least"
  4,78,"Wherever you are, death will find you out, even if you are in towers built up strong and high!\" If some good happens to them, they say, \"This is from Allah;\" But if evil (happens, to them), they say, \"This is from you (O Prophet).\" Say: \"All things are from Allah.\" But what has come to these people, that they do not understand a single word"
  4,79,"Whatever good, (O man!) happens to you, is from Allah; But whatever evil happens to you, it is from your (own) soul. And We have sent to you a messenger to (instruct) Mankind, and Allah is enough for a witness"
