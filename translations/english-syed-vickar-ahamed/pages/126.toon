quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,109,"On the Day, when Allah will gather the messengers together, and asks them: \"What was the response you received (from men to your teaching)?\" They will say: \"We have no knowledge: (It is) only You are All Knowing of all that is Hidden (Aalim-Al-Ghaib)"
  5,110,"Then will Allah say (on the Day of Judgment): \"O Isa (Jesus) the son of Maryam (Mary)! Remember My favor to you and to your mother; Look! I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit (Gabriel) so that you did speak to the people in childhood and in maturity. Look! I taught you the Book and Wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel, and when you made out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My leave, and you breathed into it, and it became a bird, by My leave, and you healed those (who were) born blind, and the lepers, by My leave. And when you brought forth the dead, by My leave; And when I did restrain the Children of Israel from (harming) you; When you did show them the Clear Signs, and the disbelievers among them said: ‘This is nothing but clear magic.’"
  5,111,"And look! I inspired the disciples to have faith in Me and My messenger: They said: ‘We have faith, and do you (also) bear witness that we bow to Allah as Muslims.’"
  5,112,"Remember! The disciples said: \"O Isa (Jesus) the son of Maryam (Mary)! Can your Lord send down to us a Table set (spread with food) from heaven?\" (For which) Isa (Jesus) said: \"Fear Allah, if you have faith"
  5,113,"They said: \"We only wish to eat from there and satisfy our hearts, and to know that you have indeed told us the truth: And that we ourselves may be witness to the miracle"
