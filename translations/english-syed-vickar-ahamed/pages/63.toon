quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,And how can you reject Faith when the Signs of Allah are rehearsed to you and among you lives the Messenger (Muhammad)? Whoever holds firmly to Allah will be shown the Straight Path
  3,102,"O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and do not die except in a state of Islam (submission to Allah)"
  3,103,"And hold fast, all of you together by the Rope which Allah (stretches out for you), and do not be divided among yourselves (being Muslims); And remember with thanks Allah’s favor on you; For you were enemies and He joined your hearts together in love, so that by His Grace you became brethren; And you were on the brink to the Pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does Allah make His Signs clear to you: That you may be guided"
  3,104,"Let there arise from among you a group of people inviting to all that is good, bringing together what is right, and forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones to reach ultimate felicity"
  3,105,"Do not be like those who are divided among themselves and fall into disputes after receiving clear Signs: For them is a dreadful Penalty—"
  3,106,"On the Day when some faces will be (bright with joy) white and some faces will be (in gloom of) black: To those whose faces will be black, (will be said): \"Did you reject Faith after accepting it? Taste then the Penalty for rejecting Faith"
  3,107,"And those whose faces that will be (bright with joy) white, — They will be in (the light of) Allah’s Mercy: To live in there (forever)"
  3,108,"These are the Signs of Allah: We recite them to you in Truth: And Allah does not mean injustice to any of His creatures"
