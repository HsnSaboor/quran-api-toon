  22,18,"Do you not see that all things that are in the heavens and on earth, bow down to Allah in worship— And the sun, and the moon, and the stars; And the hills, and the trees, and the animals; And a great number among mankind prostrate themselves to Allah? But there are those in a great number, for whom Punishment is (coming and) justified: And those whom Allah shall disgrace— None can lift (them) to grace: Because Allah fulfills everything that He wills"
