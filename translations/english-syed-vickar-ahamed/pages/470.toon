  40,26,"Said Firon (Pharaoh): \"Leave me to kill Musa (Moses); And let him call on his Lord! What I fear is that he may change your religion, or that he may cause mischief to appear in the land"
  40,27,"Musa (Moses) said; \"I have really called upon my Lord and your Lord (for protection) from everyone (who is) proud (and) who does not believe in the Day of Account"
  40,28,"And a believing man from the people of Firon (Pharaoh), who had hidden his faith, said: \"Will you kill a man because he says, ‘My Lord is Allah?’— When he has indeed come to you with Clear (Signs) from your Lord? And if he is a liar, (the sin of) his lie is on him: But, if he is telling the Truth, then something of the (great misfortune) about which he warns you, will fall upon you: Truly, Allah does not guide the one who sins against (Him) and lies"
  40,29,"O my people! The power this day is yours: You have the upper hand in the land: But who will help us from the Punishment of Allah, should it come upon us?\" Firon (Pharaoh) said: \"I point out to you only what I see (myself); Nor do I guide you to (any path) but to the path of right"
  40,30,"Then the man who believed said: \"O my people! I do truly fear for you something like the Day (of great suffering) for those who join together (in sin)"
  40,31,"Something like the fate of the people of Nuh (Noah), and ‘Ad, and the Samood (Thamud), and those who came after them: And Allah never wishes injustice to His servants"
  40,32,"And, O my people! Verily, I fear for you a Day when there will be calling one another (in sorrow)—"
  40,33,"A Day when you shall turn your backs and run away: No defender shall you have from Allah: And anyone whom Allah leaves to become lost, for him there is none to guide"
