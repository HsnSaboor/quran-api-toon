quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  4,20,"But if you decide to take one wife in place of another, even if you had given the latter a whole treasure for dowry, do not take back the least bit of it: Would you take it by slander and a clear wrong"
  4,21,"And how could you take it (back) when you have gone in unto each other, and they have taken from you a holy promise"
  4,22,"And marry not women whom your fathers married— Except what is past: It was shameful and offensive— A very unpleasant custom indeed"
  4,23,"Prohibited to you (for marriage) are— Your mothers, your daughters, your sisters; Your father’s sisters, your mother’s sisters; Your brother’s daughters, your sister’s daughters; Your foster mothers (who breast fed you), your foster sisters; Mothers of your wives; Your stepdaughters under your guardianship, born of your wives unto whom you have gone in— (Those who have been) wives of your sons whom you have fathered; And two sisters in wedlock at one and the same time, Except for what is past; Verily, Allah is ever Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
