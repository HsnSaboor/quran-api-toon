quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  47,12,"Surely, Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous good deeds, to Paradise beneath which rivers flow; While the disbelievers will enjoy (this world) and eat as cattle eat: And Fire will be their home"
  47,13,"And how many cities, with more power than your city (Makkah) that has driven you out, have We destroyed (for the sins of their people)? And there was none to help them"
  47,14,"Then, can he who is on a clear (Path) from his Lord, no better than one to whom the evil of his conduct seems pleasing, and those who follow their own desires"
  47,15,"(Here is) a story (of similarity) about the Paradise which the righteous (the pious believers) are promised: In it are rivers of water made pure and clean; Rivers of milk whose taste never changes; Rivers of wine, a joy to those who drink; And rivers of honey, pure and clear. In it, there are for them all kinds of fruits; And forgiveness (and grace) from their Lord. (Can those in these Gardens) be compared to those who shall live, forever in the Fire, and be given, to drink, boiling water, so that it cuts up their stomachs (to pieces)"
  47,16,"And among them are men who listen to you, but in the end, when they go away from you, they say to those who have received knowledge, \"What is it he said just then?\" Such are men whose hearts Allah has sealed, because they follow their own (evil) wishes"
  47,17,"And as for those who receive (Allah’s) guidance, He increases the (light of) guidance, and places on them their (true) Faith and (pure) control (away from evil)"
  47,18,"Then, do they (the unbelievers) only wait for the Hour— That it should come on them of a sudden? But already have come some tokens of it, and when it is (actually) on them, then, how can they benefit by their warnings"
  47,19,"(O Prophet), therefore know, that there is no god but Allah, and ask forgiveness for your sin, and for the men and women who believe: For Allah knows how you move about and (Allah knows) how you live in your homes"
