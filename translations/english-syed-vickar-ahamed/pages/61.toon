quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,84,"Say: \"We believe in Allah, and in what has been sent down to us and what was sent down to Ibrahim (Abraham), Ismail (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac), Yaqoub (Jacob), and the tribes, and in (the Books) given to Musa (Moses), Isa (Jesus), and the prophets, from their Lord: We make no distinction between one and another of them, and to Allah do we surrender our will (in Islam)"
  3,85,"If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah), it will never be accepted from him; In the Hereafter, he will be with those who have lost (all spiritual reward)"
  3,86,How shall Allah guide those who reject Faith after they accepted it and stood witness that the Prophet (Muhammad) was true and that Clear Signs had come to them (the prophets)? But Allah does not guide those (unjust) people
  3,87,"For such (people) the reward is that on them (rests) the curse of Allah, of His angels, and of all Mankind—"
  3,88,"In that they will dwell; Their penalty will not be lightened, relief will not be their (share)—"
  3,89,"Except for those who repent and after that, make changes (in their actions); Surely, Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  3,90,"Verily, those who reject Faith after they accepted it, and then go on adding to their defiance of Faith— Their repentance will never be accepted; Because they are those who have (willfully) gone astray"
  3,91,"Verily, about those who reject Faith, and die rejecting— Never would be accepted from any such (persons) all the gold that the earth contains, even though they should offer it (only) to ransom themselves. For such (people) is a painful penalty, and they will find no helpers"
