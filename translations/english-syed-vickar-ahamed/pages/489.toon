quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  42,52,"And thus have We by Our Command, sent Revelation to you (O Prophet): You did not know (before) what was Revelation, and what was Faith; But We have made the (Quran), a (Divine) Light, with this We guide such of Our servants as We will; And surely, you (O Prophet) do guide (men) to the Straight Path—"
  42,53,"The (Straight) Way of Allah, to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Verily! (How) all things (and events) return back to Allah (for Judgment)"
  43,1,Ha Mim
  43,2,And the clear Book (the Quran that makes things clearly visible)—
  43,3,"Verily, We have made it a Quran in Arabic that you may be able to understand (and learn)"
  43,4,"And surely, it is (from within) the Mother of the Book (Verse 13.39) with Us, indeed, in Our Presence, high (in dignity), full of wisdom"
  43,5,"Shall We then take away the Remainder (this Quran) from you and keep (you) away, because you are people who exceed (your) limits"
  43,6,And how many prophets We sent among the peoples of the old
  43,7,And there was never a prophet who came to them at whom they did not mock
  43,8,Then We destroyed (them)— (Even) stronger in power than these (people)— The stories of the olden peoples have been passed (to you to learn from them)
  43,9,"And indeed, if you were to ask them, \"Who created the heavens and the earth?\" They would be sure to reply; \"They were created by (Him), the Exalted in Power (Al-Aziz), the All Knowing (Al-Aleem)"
  43,10,"(Allah,) Who has made for you, the earth spread out (like a carpet), and has made for you roads (and channels) in there, that you may find guidance (on the way)"
