quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,23,"No intercession (or help) can be of use in His Presence except for those to whom He has given permission. So far (is this true) that, when the fear is taken away from their (even the angel’s) hearts, they will say: ‘What is it that your Lord ordered?’ (But then again) they will say: 'That which is true and just; And He is the Highest (Al-Ali’i), the Greatest (Al-Kabir)"
  34,24,"Say: \"Who gives you provision (your livelihood), from the heavens and (from) the earth?\" Say: \"It is Allah; And it is (also) certain that either we or you are in right guidance or in clear error"
  34,25,"Say: \"You shall not be asked about our sins, and we shall not be asked about what you do"
  34,26,"Say: \"Our Lord will bring (all of) us together and in the end, (He) will judge the matter between us in truth and justice: And He is the One to judge (Al-Fatta'h), the All Knowing (Al-Aleem, of the true status of all affairs)"
  34,27,"Say: \"Show me those whom you have joined with Him as 'partners' (to Him): Nay! But He is Allah, the Almighty (Al-Aziz), All Wise (Al-Hakeem)"
  34,28,"And We have not sent you except as one to give them good news, and to warn them (of the punishment; As a messenger and a guide to mankind), but most men do not understand"
  34,29,"And they say: \"When will this promise (come true), if you are (really) telling the truth"
  34,30,"Say: \"The time (fixed) for you is till a Day, which you cannot delay even by an hour nor make it sooner"
  34,31,"And those who disbelieve say: \"We shall neither believe in this Quran nor in (any) that (came) before it.\" But if you could only see when the wrongdoer will be made to stand before their Lord, shifting the word (blaming) one another! Those who had been disliked will say to the proud and arrogant ones: \"If it was not for you, we should certainly have been believers"
