quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  27,36,"So, when (the ministers) came to Sulaiman (Solomon), he said: \"Will you give me a lot of wealth? But what Allah has given me is better than what He has given to you! Really! It is you who take joy in your gift"
  27,37,"Go back to them, and be sure we will come to them with strong armies that they will never be able to meet: And we shall remove them from there in disgrace, and they will feel in low position"
  27,38,"He said (to his own army): \"You chiefs! Which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me surrendering as Muslims, in submission"
  27,39,"Said an Ifrit, from the (race of) jinns': \"I will bring it to you before you get up from your Court (and gathering now): Truly, I have the full strength for the deed, and (I am) trustworthy for such work (service to you)"
  27,40,"Said one who had knowledge of the Scripture: \"I will bring it to you by the blinking of an eye!\" then as (Sulaiman) saw it placed firmly before him, he said: \"This is by the Grace of my Lord! To test me whether I am thankful or unthankful! And if anyone is thankful, truly, his gratitude is (only for the good) for his own soul; But if anyone is unthankful, truly, My Lord is free of all Needs (Ghani), All Bountiful (Kareem, in His generosity)"
  27,41,"He said: \"Change her throne that it is beyond recognition by her let us see whether she is guided (to Allah) or (she) is one of those who takes no guidance"
  27,42,"So when she arrived, she was asked, \"Is your throne like this?” She said; \"(It is) as if it was just the same;\" He said: \"Knowledge was bestowed to us before her, and we have submitted to Allah (in Islam)"
  27,43,"And she came away from the worship of others besides Allah: For she was from a people who had no faith"
  27,44,"She was asked to enter the high palace: but when she saw it, she thought it was a pool (lake) of water, and (pulled up her skirts), showing her legs. He (Sulaiman) said: \"This is only a palace smoothly covered with sheets of glass.\" She said: \"O my Lord! Truly, I have wronged my soul: And I submit with Sulaiman (Solomon) to Allah and to the Lord of the Worlds (Rab-ul-'Ala'meen)"
