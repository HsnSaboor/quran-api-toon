quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the break of Day; (Allah swears by the Dawn of the Day)
  89,2,And by the ten nights
  89,3,And by the even and odd (contrasted)
  89,4,And by the night when it passes away; —
  89,5,Is there (not) in these a Sign for those who understand
  89,6,Do you not see how your Mighty Lord dealt with the people of 'Ad —
  89,7,"(And with the people) of the (city of) Iram, with lofty pillars"
  89,8,Which have not been reproduced in (all) the land
  89,9,And with the people of Samood (Thamud) who cut out (huge) rocks in the valley? —
  89,10,"And with Firon (Pharaoh), the lord of stakes"
  89,11,These (people) exceeded beyond limits in the lands
  89,12,And here (they) piled mischief (upon mischief)
  89,13,Therefore did your Mighty Lord send upon them very lowly punishments
  89,14,Because your (Mighty) Lord is (like a Guardian) on a watch tower
  89,15,"Now, as for man, when his Mighty Lord tries him (by) giving him honor and gifts then he (proudly) says, \"My Mighty Lord has honored me"
  89,16,"But when He tries him, (by) restricting his livelihood for him, then he says (in despair), \"My Mighty Lord has put me to shame"
  89,17,"No, no! But you do not honor the orphans"
  89,18,Nor do you encourage one another to feed the poor! —
  89,19,And you (wrongly) consume inheritance— With all (the) greed
  89,20,And you love wealth with passion
  89,21,No! When the earth is pounded to powder
  89,22,"And your Mighty Lord arrives and His angels, rank upon rank"
  89,23,"And on that Day, (when) Hell is brought (face to face), — On that Day will man remember, but (alas!) how will that remembrance profit him"
