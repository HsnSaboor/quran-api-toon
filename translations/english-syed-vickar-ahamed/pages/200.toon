quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,80,"Whether you (O Muhammad) ask forgiveness for them (the hypocrites) or not, (their sin will not be forgiven): Even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times for their forgiveness, Allah will (still) not forgive them: Because they have rejected Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad): And Allah does not guide those who are wrongfully rebellious"
  9,81,"Those who stayed behind (from the Tabuk expedition) were happy not doing anything behind the back of the Messenger (Muhammad) of Allah: And they hated to struggle and fight, with their goods and themselves, in the Cause of Allah: And they said, \"Do not go out in the heat.\" Say, \"The Fire of Hell is hotter in heat.\" If they could only understand"
  9,82,"So let them laugh a little: And (they will) weep a lot: A repayment for the (evil) that they do"
  9,83,"If, after this, Allah brings you back to any of them, and they ask for your permission to go out (with you to fight) say: \"You shall never come out with me, nor fight an enemy with me: Because you liked to sit without doing anything in the first place: Then you sit (now) with those who stay behind"
  9,84,"Nor do you ever pray (the funeral prayer) for any of them who dies, nor stand at his grave. Certainly, they (the hypocrites) rejected Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and died in a state of wrongful revolt"
  9,85,"Do not let their wealth, nor their sons (to follow them) overwhelm you: Allah’s plan is to punish them with these things in this world; And that their souls may die by their (very) denial of Allah"
  9,86,"And when a Sura comes down, (strongly) guiding them to believe in Allah and to work and fight along with His Messenger (Muhammad), those with wealth and power (over others) from them ask you to excuse (them), and say: \"Leave us (behind): We will be with those who sit (at home)"
