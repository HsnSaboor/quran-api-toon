quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,"Verily, those who do not believe in the Hereafter, give names to the angels that are female names"
  53,28,"But they do not have knowledge about it. They follow nothing except (their) guesswork; And, surely, guesswork is of no use against Truth"
  53,29,Therefore keep away from those who turn away from Our Message and (those who) want nothing except the life of this world
  53,30,"That is as far as knowledge will reach them. Surely, your Lord knows best those who wander away from His Path, and He knows best those who receive guidance"
  53,31,"And, to Allah belongs all there is in the heavens and on earth: So He rewards those who do evil, according to their actions, and He rewards those who do good, with what is best"
  53,32,"Those who keep away from great sins and shameful deeds, only (being caught up in) small faults— Surely, your Lord is plentiful in forgiveness. He knows you well when he creates you out of the earth (your chromosomes), and when you are hidden in your mothers’ wombs. Therefore do not justify yourselves: He knows best who it is who keeps away evil"
  53,33,Do you see the one who turns back (from Faith)
  53,34,Gives (in) a little then hardens his heart (and his feelings)
  53,35,Does he have knowledge about the unseen so that he can see
  53,36,No! Is he not familiar with what is in the books of Musa (Moses)—
  53,37,And of Ibrahim (Abraham) who filled his promises
  53,38,"Namely, that no bearer of burdens can carry the burden of another"
  53,39,And that man can have nothing except what he works (hard) for
  53,40,That (the fruit of) his work will soon come in sight
  53,41,Then will he be rewarded with a complete reward
  53,42,And that the final Goal is to your Lord
  53,43,That it is He Who gives laughter and tears
  53,44,That it is He Who causes death and gives life (again)
