  76,7,"They make (their) vows, and they fear a Day whose sorrow spreads far and wide"
  76,8,"And they feed for the love of Allah the needy, the orphan, and the captive and the needy,—"
  76,9,"(Saying), \"We feed you for the sake of Allah Alone, no reward do we want from you, nor thanks"
  76,10,"Verily, We only fear a Day of painful suffering (that may arrive) from the side of our Lord"

  76,12,"And because they were patient and steady, He will reward them with a Garden and (clothes of) silk"
  76,13,"Reclining in the (Garden) on raised couches (thrones), they will see there neither the sun’s (extreme heat) nor the moon’s (extreme cold)"
  76,14,"And the shades of the (Garden) will come low over them, and the bunches (of fruit), there will hang low in (their) easy reach"
  76,15,And among them will be passed round containers of silver and glasses of crystal—
  76,16,"Crystal-clear, made of silver: They will determine the amount in there (according to their wishes)"
  76,17,And they will be given to drink from a Cup (of drink) mixed with Zanjabil (ginger)—

  76,23,"Verily, it is We Who have sent down the Quran to you by stages"
  76,24,"Therefore be patient with uniformity to the Command of your Lord, and do not listen to the sinner or the thankless among them"
  76,25,And praise (with joy) the Name of your Lord every morning (Faj’r) and afternoon (Zuh’r and ‘Asr)
