quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  46,29,"And remember when We turned towards you a company of jinns' (to be quietly) listening to the Quran: When they stood in the presence thereof they said: \"Listen in silence!\" When the (reading) was finished, they returned to their people, to warn (them of their sins)"
  46,30,"They (the jinns') said: \"O our people! Verily, we have heard a Book revealed after Musa (Moses), confirming what came before it: It guides (men) to the Truth and to the Straight Path"
  46,31,"O our people! Pay attention to the one who calls to Allah, and believe in Him: He (Allah) will forgive you for your faults, and deliver you from a painful penalty"
  46,32,"And if anyone does not pay attention to the one who invites (us) to Allah, he cannot frustrate (Allah’s Plan) on earth, and no protectors can he have besides Allah: Such men (only wander) in open error"
  46,33,"Do they not see that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and never got tired with their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Yes! He indeed, is All Able (Khadir) to do all things"
  46,34,"And on the Day that the unbelievers will be placed before the Fire, (they will be asked:) \"Is this not the Truth?\" They will say: \"Yes, by our Lord!\" (One will say:) \"Then you taste the penalty, for that you were used to denying (the Truth)"
  46,35,"Therefore patiently work hard, as did (all) messengers with unchanging purpose; And do not be in haste about the (unbelievers). On the Day that they see the (punishment) promised to them, (it will be) as if they had not spent more than an hour of a single day. (O Prophet! Your duty is only) to state and repeat the Message: But will any be destroyed except those who transgress (and exceed their limits)"
