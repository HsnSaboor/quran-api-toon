quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  35,4,"And if they (the unbelievers) deny you, (many earlier) messengers were (also) rejected before you; All affairs go back to Allah for the (final) decision"
  35,5,"O Mankind! The Promise of Allah is certainly true! Then, do not let the life of the world, deceive you, and do not let the Chief Deceiver (Satan) deceive you about Allah"
  35,6,"Surely, Satan is an enemy to you: So treat him like an enemy. He only calls to his followers, so that they may (also) be companions of the blazing Fire"
  35,7,"For those who reject Allah, there is a terrible penalty: But for those who believe and do rightful good deeds, there is Forgiveness, and a great Reward"
  35,8,"Is he, then, to whom the evil of what he does, looks to be attractive, (equal as the one who is rightly guided)? Surely, Allah leaves to wander whom He wills, and guides whom He wills, so (O Prophet!) do not let your soul go out in sorrow after them: Truly, Allah is All Knowing (Aleem) of all that they do"
  35,9,"It is Allah Who sends out the winds, so that they pick up (and move) the clouds, and We drive them towards a land that is dead (barren), and then bring back life to the earth after its death: Like this there (will be) the Resurrection (to bring back the dead for Judgment)"
  35,10,"In case any want glory and power— (Let it be known to them that) to Allah belong all Glory and Power. To Him go up (and suit all) words of (utmost) Purity: It is He Who glorifies every deed of Righteousness. For those who plot Evil— For them is a terrible penalty; And the plotting of such (Evil) will be of no use"
  35,11,"And Allah created you from dust (at first); Then from a sperm-ovary drop (Nutfah); Then He made you in pairs. And no female becomes pregnant, or lays down (her baby), except with His knowledge. Also no old man is given more number of days, and no part is taken away from his life; except as it is in a record (with Allah). All this is easy for Allah"
