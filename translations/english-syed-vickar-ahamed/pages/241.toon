  12,44,"They (the chiefs) said: \"A confused mixture of false dreams: And we are not skilled in interpreting the meaning of dreams"
  12,45,"Then one of the two (men from the prison) who was set free, and who now thought of him (Yusuf) after a long time, said: \"I will tell you the truth of its meaning: So you send me"
  12,46,"(The man from the prison said:) \"O Yusuf (Joseph)! O man of truth! Explain to us (the dream) of seven fat cows whom seven lean ones eat up, and of seven green ears of corn and others dry: That I may go back to the people, and that they may know (and understand the meaning of the dream)"
  12,47,"(Yusuf) said: \"For seven consecutive years you shall carefully sow (and grow) as you are used to (doing): And the crops that you reap, you will leave them in the ear— Except a little, from which you will eat"
  12,48,"Then after that will come (a period of) seven terrible (and hard years), which will eat (away) what you will have saved before for them— (All) except a little which you will have saved (specially for seed)"
  12,49,"Then after that will come a year in which the people will have plenty of water, and in this (year) they will press (wine and oil)"
  12,50,"And the king said: \"You bring him (Yusuf) to me,\" but when the messenger came to him, (Yusuf) said: \"You go back to your king and ask him, ‘What is the state of mind of the ladies who cut their hands?’, For my Lord (Allah) is Well-Aware of their plot.’"
  12,51,"(The king) said (to the ladies): \"What was your affair when you wanted to seduce Yusuf (Joseph) from his (true) self?\" The ladies said: \"Allah save us! We know of no evil against him! The ‘Aziz's wife said: \"Now the truth is clear (to all): It was I who wanted to seduce him from his (true) self: He is surely from those who are (always) true (and noble)"
  12,52,"(I say) this, so that he may know that I have never been false to him in his absence, and that Allah will never help the plots set by the false ones"
