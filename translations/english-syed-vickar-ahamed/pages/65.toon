quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,116,"Surely, those who reject Faith— Neither their possessions nor their (numerous) descendants will be of any use against Allah: They will be companions of the Fire— Living in there (forever)"
  3,117,"What they spend in the life from this (material) world may be compared to a wind that brings nipping frost: It strikes and destroys the crops of men who have wronged their own souls: It is not Allah who has wronged them, but they (continue to) wrong themselves"
  3,118,"O you who believe! Do not take into your closeness those (who are) outside your (own) circles: They (those outside your own circles) will not fail to spoil you. They only desire your ruin: Hatred of ranks (and people within your circles) has already appeared from their mouths: What their hearts hide is far worse (than what they have said). Indeed, We have made plain to you the Signs, if you have understanding (and wisdom)"
  3,119,"Oh! You are those who love them, but they do not love you— Though you believe in the whole of the Book. When they meet you, they say: \"We believe:\" But when they are alone, they bite off the very tips of their fingers in their rage at you. Say: \"Perish in your rage; Allah knows well all the secrets of the hearts"
  3,120,"If a little bit of good comes to you, it saddens them; And if some misfortune comes to you, they become happy at it. But if you are constant and do right, not the least harm will their cunning do to you; Because Allah compasses around about all that they do"
  3,121,"And (remember) that morning, when you left your household (early) to leave the faithful (ones) at their stations for battle (of Uhud): And Allah hears and knows all things"
