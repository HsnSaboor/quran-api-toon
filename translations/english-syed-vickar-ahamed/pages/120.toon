quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,71,"They thought there would be no trial (Or punishment for their actions) so they became blind and deaf; (not to see or to hear about their own actions.) yet Allah (in Mercy) turned to them; even after that, many of them became blind and deaf. But Allah sees well all that they do"
  5,72,"They surely lie (against Allah, those) who say, \"Allah is Messiah (Christ), the son of Maryam (Mary).\" But Messiah (Christ himself) said: \"O Children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.\" Verily, whoever joins other gods with Allah, Allah will forbid him the Garden, and the Fire will be his home. For the wrongdoers there will be no one to help"
  5,73,"They surely lie (against Allah, those) who say, \"Allah is one of three in a Trinity:\" There is no god except One Allah. If they do not stop (themselves) from their word (of lies), a painful penalty will surely fall upon the liars among them"
  5,74,"Why do they not turn to Allah, and seek His forgiveness? For Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  5,75,"Messiah (Christ), the son of Maryam (Mary) was no more than a messenger; (And there were) many messengers that have passed away before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They both had to eat their (daily) food. See how Allah does make His Signs clear to them; Yet see in what ways they are misguided far from the truth"
  5,76,"Say: \"Will you worship, besides Allah, something which has no power to either harm (you) or to help you? But Allah— He is the All Hearing (Sami’), the All Knowing (Al-Aleem)"
