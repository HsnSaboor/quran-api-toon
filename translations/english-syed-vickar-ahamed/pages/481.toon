quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,39,"And among His Signs is this: You see the earth with nothing growing and wasted, but when We send down rain to it, it is (gently) brought to life and (the plants) regrow. Truly, He Who gives life to it (the earth which is dead) can surely give life to the dead. Indeed, over all things, He is most Powerful (Khadir , Able to do all things)"
  41,40,"Verily, those who distort (and change) the Truth in Our Signs (Ayat) are not hidden from Us. Who is better? He who is thrown into the Fire, or he that comes safely through, on the Day of Judgment? Do what you want to do: (But be) sure, He is All Seeing (Baseer) of everything that you do"
  41,41,"Verily, those who reject the Message when it comes to them (are not hidden from Us). And indeed it (the Quran) is a Book protected by supreme power"
  41,42,"No falsehood can approach it (the Quran) from before or behind: It is sent down by (Allah, the One) full of Wisdom (Hakeem), Worthy of all Praise (Hameed)"
  41,43,"Nothing is said to you that was not (already) said to the messengers before you: Surely, that your Lord has, at His Command, (all the) Forgiveness and also the most painful penalty"
  41,44,"If We had sent this as a Quran (in a language) other than Arabic, they would have said: \"Why are not its verses explained in details? What! (A Book) not in Arabic and (a Messenger) an Arab?\" Say: \"It is a guide and a healing (cure) for those who believe; And for those who do not believe, there is no hearing in their ears, and there is a blindness in their (eyes): They are (like those) being called from a far distant place"
  41,45,"And (indeed), We certainly gave Musa (Moses) the Book (Torah) before: But differences came about in there. And if it was not for a Word that went out before from your Lord, (their differences) would have been settled between them. But truly, they remained in suspicious and discomforting doubt upon it"
  41,46,"Anyone who acts righteous good deeds helps his own soul; Anyone who works evil, it is against his own soul. And your Lord is never unjust (in the least) to his servants"
