quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and its glory
  91,2,And by the moon as follows it
  91,3,And by the Day as it reveals (the sun’s) glory
  91,4,And by the night as it conceals it
  91,5,And by the sky and its (wonderful) structure
  91,6,And by the earth and its (vast) territory
  91,7,And by the soul and the proportion and order given to it
  91,8,And its enlightenment and to its wrong and to its right—
  91,9,"Truly, he succeeds who purifies it"
  91,10,And he fails who corrupts it
  91,11,The people of Samood (Thamud) rejected (their messenger) by their excessive wrong-doing
  91,12,"Look, the most wicked man among them was chosen (for the crime)"
  91,13,"But the messenger of Allah said to them: \"It is a she-camel of Allah! And (let her) have her drink"
  91,14,"Then they rejected him (as a false prophet) and they injured her (by cutting her hamstrings, See 54.29). So their Lord, on account of their crime, removed their traces and made them equal (in destruction)"
  91,15,"And for Him, there is no fear of its consequences"
  92,1,By the night when it becomes dark
  92,2,By the day as it appears in glory
  92,3,By (the mystery of) the creation of male and female—
  92,4,"Surely, you seek diverse (goals)"
  92,5,"So, he who gives (in charity) and fears (Allah)"
  92,6,And (in all sincerity) accepts and follows the best—
  92,7,We will indeed make smooth for him the path to happiness
  92,8,But he who is a greedy miser and thinks himself to be self-sufficient
  92,9,And gives the lie to the best—
  92,10,We will indeed make smooth for him the path to misery
  92,11,(All of) his wealth will not profit him when he falls headlong (into the pit of Fire)
  92,12,"Surely, We take upon Ourselves to guide"
  92,13,And surely to Us (belong both) the end and the beginning
  92,14,Therefore do I warn you of a Fire flaming fiercely
