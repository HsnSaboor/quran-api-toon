quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"(The hypocrites are) the ones who sit and watch about you: If you do gain a victory from Allah, they say: \"Were we not with you?\"— But if the disbelievers gain a success, they say (to them): \"Did we not gain an advantage over you, and did we not guard you from the believers?\" But Allah will judge between you on the Day Of Judgment. And never will Allah grant to the disbelievers a way (to win) over the believers"
  4,142,"Surely, they, the hypocrites, search ways of deceiving Allah, but it is He Who will deceive (and reach over) them: When they stand up to prayer, they stand without sincerity, to be seen of men, but little do they hold Allah in remembrance"
  4,143,(They are distracted in mind) swaying between this and that being (sincere) to neither one group nor to the another (group). (He) whom Allah leaves straying— Never will you find for him the Way
  4,144,"O you who believe! Do not take for friends’ disbelievers rather than believers: Do you wish to give Allah a manifest proof against yourselves"
  4,145,"Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire: You will not find a helper for them—"
  4,146,"Except for those who repent, do righteous and good deeds, mend (their life), hold fast to Allah, and purify their religion as in Allah’s sight: If so they will be (included) with the believers. And soon will Allah grant to the believers a reward of great value"
  4,147,"What can Allah gain by your punishment, when you are grateful and you believe? No! It is Allah Who is Appreciative (Shakir) (for the all the good), All Knowing (Aleem)"
