quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"But they denied him, so they will be truly brought up (for punishment)—"
  37,128,Except the sincere and the devoted servants of Allah (among them)
  37,129,And We left for him (this blessing) in the generations to follow in later times
  37,130,Peace be upon those like Ilyas (Elias)
  37,131,"Verily, thus do We reward those who do good"
  37,132,"Indeed, he was one of Our believing servants"
  37,133,"And verily, Lut (Lot) was one of the messengers"
  37,134,"Truly, We saved him and all his people (with him)"
  37,135,Except an old woman (his wife) who was with those who fell behind
  37,136,Then We destroyed the rest
  37,137,"Surely, you pass by their (sites) by the morning—"
  37,138,"And by night: Will you not reflect and understand"
  37,139,"And verily, Yunus (Jonah) was one of the messengers"
  37,140,When he ran away (like a slave runs from captivity) to the ship (fully) loaded (with men and cargo)
  37,141,"Then he (agreed to foretell fortunes and) cast lots, (and he was blamed for the ships bad weather) and he was a loser, punished (and thrown in the sea)"
  37,142,"Then the (big) fish swallowed him, and he had done actions worthy of blame (by running away from his mission)"
  37,143,If it was that he had not (repented and) glorified Allah
  37,144,He would surely have remained inside the fish till the Day of Resurrection (to be raised from the dead)
  37,145,But We cast (threw) him on the open shore while he was (still) sick
  37,146,And We made a vine (of hard shelled fruit) to grow over him for shade
  37,147,And We sent him to (teach Allah’s Message to) a hundred thousand (men) or more
  37,148,And they believed; So We let them enjoy (their lives) for a while
  37,149,"Now ask them (the unbelievers) what they think: Is it that your Lord has (only) daughters, and they have sons"
  37,150,"Or that We created the angels female, and they have seen (it)"
  37,151,"Verily, is it not they who say (in their disbelief and), from their own lies and sayings"
  37,152,"Allah has had children?\" And verily, they are liars"
  37,153,Did He (then) choose daughters rather than sons
