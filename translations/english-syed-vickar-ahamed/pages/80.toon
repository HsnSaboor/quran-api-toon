quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,15,"And if any of your women are guilty of being illicit in (sexual) conduct, take the evidence of four witnesses from your (own) people against them; And if they testify, confine them to the house until they die or Allah decides some (other) way for them"
  4,16,"And the two persons among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both; And if they repent and improve, leave them alone; Surely, Allah Forgives and Accepts repentance (Tawwab), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  4,17,"Allah accepts only the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and (their) foolishness and repent soon afterwards; To them will Allah turn in mercy: For Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom"
  4,18,"And the repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds is of no effect, until death faces one of them, and he says, \"Now have I repented indeed,\" nor of those who die rejecting Faith: For them We have prepared a punishment most painful"
  4,19,"O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will nor should you treat them with harshness, that you may take away part of the dowry you have given to them— Except where they have been guilty of open illicit sexual deeds (lustfulness); On the contrary live with them on a basis of kindness and justice. If you take a dislike to them it may be that you dislike a thing, and Allah brings about through it a great deal of good"
