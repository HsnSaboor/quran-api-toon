quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,"Believers who sit (at home), except the disabled; And receive no hurt (of fight), are not equal to those who struggle and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and their person. Allah has granted a position higher to those who struggle and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit (at home). To each Allah has promised good (reward): But Allah has given a (special) position to those who struggle and fight above those who sit (at home) with a great reward—"
  4,96,"Positions specially given by Him— (And also) Forgiveness and Mercy. And Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  4,97,"Verily, as for those, when angels take the souls of those who die in sin against their souls, they (angels) say: \"What (condition) were you in?\" They reply: \"We were weak and oppressed in the earth.\" They say: \"Was the earth of Allah not spacious enough for you to move yourselves away (from evil)?\" Such men will find their home in Hell— What an evil refuge"
  4,98,"Except those who are (really) weak and oppressed— Among men, women, and children— Who have no means in their power, nor (a guide post) to direct their way"
  4,99,"For these (weak and oppressed), Allah may forgive: And Allah is Often-Pardoning (‘Afuw), Often Forgiving (Ghafoor)"
  4,100,"He who leaves his home in the cause of Allah, finds on the earth, many places (of rest), (which are) wide and spacious: Should he who has left home, die as a person away from home for (the sake of) Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), his reward becomes due and certain with Allah: And Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  4,101,"And when you travel through the earth, there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear the disbelievers may put you in trial (attack you): Surely, the disbelievers are open enemies to you"
