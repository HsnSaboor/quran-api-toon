quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  18,62,"When they had traveled (some more), he (Musa, Moses) said to his attendant: \"Bring us our early meal; Truly, we have suffered much fatigue at this (time in) our journey"
  18,63,"He replied: \"Do you remember (what happened) when we took ourselves to the rock? Truly, I did forget the fish: None but Satan made me forget to tell (you) about it: It made its way through the sea in a marvelous way"
  18,64,"Musa (Moses)] said: \"That was what we were searching for:\" So they went back on their (own) footsteps, following (the way that they had come)"
  18,65,Then they found one (of the wise men) on whom We had bestowed Mercy from Ourselves and whom We had given knowledge from Our Own Presence
  18,66,"Musa (Moses) said to him (the wise man, Khidr): \"May I follow you, with the intention that you may teach me something of the (greater) Truth which you have been taught (by Allah)"
  18,67,"(The wise one) said: \"Surely, you will not be able to have patience with me"
  18,68,And how can you have patience about things about which your understanding is not complete
  18,69,"Musa (Moses)] said: \"You will find me (really) patient: If Allah so wishes, and I will not disobey you even a little"
  18,70,"The other said: \"If then you were to follow me, do not ask me any questions about anything until I, myself speak to you about it"
  18,71,"So they both proceeded on: Until, when they boarded in the boat, (and) he (Khidr) damaged it.; [Musa (Moses)] said: \"Have you damaged it in order to drown those in it? Truly a strange thing have you done"
  18,72,"He (Khidr) answered: \"Did I not tell you that you will not be able to have patience with me"
  18,73,"Musa (Moses)] said: \"Do not be angry with me for forgetting, nor make me sad by causing difficulties on my part"
  18,74,"Then they proceeded further: Until, when they met a boy, he (Khidr) killed him. Musa (Moses) said: \"Have you killed an innocent person who has killed no one? Truly a wicked thing have you done"
