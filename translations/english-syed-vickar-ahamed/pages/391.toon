quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,44,And you (O Prophet!) were not on the Western side (of the Tawa valley of Mount Thr) when We gave the prophethood to Musa (Moses) and you did not see (those events)
  28,45,"But We raised up (new) generations from them, and the ages that passed over them were long; And you were not a resident among the people of Madyan, repeating Our Signs to them; But it was We Who send (them) messengers"
  28,46,"And you were not at the side of (the Mountain of) Thr, when We called (to Musa). Still (O Prophet! You are sent) as a Mercy from your Lord, to give warning to a people (of Arabia) to whom had come no warner before you: In order that they may remember and receive the warning"
  28,47,"And if (We had) not (sent you to the people of Makkah)— (and) if a misfortune came over them for (the actions that) their hands have already done, they might say: \"Our Lord! Why did You not send a messenger to us? We should then have followed Your Signs and been from those who believe"
  28,48,"But (now), when the Truth has come to them from Ourselves, they say, \"Why are not (Signs of Allah) sent to him, like those (Signs; The rod, the glowing hand) which were sent to Musa (Moses)? Then, did they not reject (the Signs) which were formerly sent earlier to Musa (Moses)? They say: \"Two types of magic, one helping the other!”, And they say: “For us, We reject all (types of magic)"
  28,49,"Say (to such rejecters): \"Then you bring a Book from Allah, which is a better Guide than earlier of them, that I may follow it! If you are truthful"
  28,50,"But if they do not listen to you, (You) know that they only follow their own wishes: And who is more lost than one who follows his own wishes without the guidance from Allah? Verily, Allah does not guide people used to doing wrong"
