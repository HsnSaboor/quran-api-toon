quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,"‘And among us are some who submit their wills (to Allah as Muslims), and some who wander away from justice. Now those who submit their wills (as Muslims)— They have sought the right Path"
  72,15,"‘And those who wander away (from the right Path)— They (are only fuel for fire of Hell ’ \"—)"
  72,16,"(And Allah’s Message is): \"If they (the pagan) had (only) believed in Allah and walked on the (right) Path, we should certainly have granted (in kindness) to them (the) bountiful rain"
  72,17,"That We might try them by that (means), and if anyone turns away from remembering his Lord, he will cause (for himself) to undergo a severe penalty"
  72,18,"And the places of worship are for Allah (Alone): So do not pray to anyone along with Allah"
  72,19,"And when the one devoted (the Prophet) to Allah stands forward to pray to Him, they (the jinns') just make around him a dense crowd as if sticking to one over the other (to listen)"
  72,20,"Say: \"I do no more than call upon my Lord, and I do not join any (false gods) with Him"
  72,21,"Say: \"It is not in my power to cause you harm, nor to bring you to right conduct"
  72,22,"Say: \"No one can save me from Allah's punishment, (if I were to disobey Him) nor should I find protection except in Him"
  72,23,"Unless I proclaim what I receive from Allah and His Messages; For whoever that disobeyed Allah and His Messenger— Then verily, for him (the one who disobeys) is Hell:— He shall live in there forever"
  72,24,"At length, when they see (with their own eyes) that which they are promised— Then will they know who is the one weakest as (their) helper and least important in point of numbers"
  72,25,"Say: \"I do not know whether the (punishment) which you are promised is near or whether my Lord will appoint for it a long time (later)"
  72,26,"He (Allah, Alone) is All Knowledgeable of the Unseen, (Aalam-ul-Ghaib), nor does He make anyone familiar with His unseen mysteries—"
  72,27,"Except a messenger whom He has chosen, and then He makes a band of watchers (angels) march before him and behind him"
  72,28,"That he (the messenger) may know that they have (truly) brought and delivered the Messages of their Lord. And He surrounds (all with mysteries) that are with them, and takes account of every single thing"
