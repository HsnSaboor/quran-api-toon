quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the Star when it goes down (and sets)—
  53,2,Your Companion (the Prophet) is not in evil ways and (he is) not being misled
  53,3,And he does not say (anything) from (his own) desire
  53,4,It is nothing less than Revelation sent down to him
  53,5,"He was taught by one (Angel Gabriel, who is) mighty in power"
  53,6,"Gifted with wisdom, because he came clearly (in a noble way from limit of understanding to High Throne of Allah)"
  53,7,While he was in the highest place of the horizon (in the distant skies)
  53,8,Then he approached (nearer) and came closer
  53,9,And was at a distance of only two bow-lengths (of spiritual union) or even nearer
  53,10,Like this (Allah) brought the Revelation (and the Message) to His servant (the Prophet)— (made known) what He (wanted) to reveal
  53,11,The (mind and) heart (of the Prophet) in no way lied about what he saw
  53,12,Then will you disagree with him about what he saw
  53,13,"And indeed, he (the Prophet) truly saw him (Gabriel) as (he) came down second (time)"
  53,14,"Near the lote-tree (a thorny but a fruit bearing tree in Middle East beyond which none may pass: Symbolically, it is the limit of human understanding)"
  53,15,Near it is the Garden of Abode (Allah’s Divine Presence and His Paradise)
  53,16,When the lote-tree was covered (in mystic wisdom that cannot be spoken)
  53,17,The (Prophet’s) vision (of Angel Gabriel) was never broken and it did not go wrong
  53,18,"Indeed he (the Prophet) saw, from the Signs of his Lord, the Greatest"
  53,19,"Have you seen Al-Lat and Al-Uzza, (two forms of pagan Arabs goddesses in human forms)"
  53,20,"And another, the third (goddess), Manat"
  53,21,"What (silliness)! For you (yourselves) the male sex, and for Him, the female"
  53,22,"That indeed, such a division will truly be most unjust"
  53,23,"These are nothing (at all) except names that you have made up— You and your fathers— For which Allah has not sent down any authority (whatever). They follow nothing but their own guesswork and what their own souls wish! Even though, already there has come to them guidance from their Lord"
  53,24,No! Shall man have anything (just because) he wishes for it
  53,25,But it is Allah to Whom the end and the beginning (of everything) belong
  53,26,"And there are many angels in the heavens, their pleading will be of no use except after Allah has given permission for whom He pleases and that he is acceptable to Him"
