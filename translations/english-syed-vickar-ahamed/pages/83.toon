quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,27,"Allah does wish to turn to you but the wish of those who follow their lusts is that you should turn away (from Him)— Far, far away"
  4,28,"Allah does wish to lighten your (difficulties): And man was created weak"
  4,29,"O you who believe! Do not eat up your property among yourselves in (worthless) deception: But let there be among you exchange and trade by mutual good-will: And do not kill (or destroy) from yourselves: Surely, to you Allah has been Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  4,30,"And if any does that in hate and injustice— Soon shall We throw him into the Fire: And it is easy for Allah (to do)"
  4,31,"If you (only) avoid the most (excessively) evil of the things that you are forbidden to do, We shall expel out of you all the evil in you, and admit you to a Gate of Great Honor (the Paradise)"
  4,32,"And it is not wise to seek out those things in which Allah has bestowed His gifts more freely on some of you than on others: To men is reward for what they earn, to women (also) is reward for what they earn: And ask Allah of His bounty. Surely, Allah is All Knowing (Aleem) of all things"
  4,33,"To (benefit) everyone, We have appointed sharers and heirs to property left by parents and relatives. To those also, to whom your right hand pledged, give their due portion. Truly Allah is Total Witness (Shaheed) to all things"
