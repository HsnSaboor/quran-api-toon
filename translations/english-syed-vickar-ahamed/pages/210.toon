quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,15,"And when Our Clear Signs (verses) are rehearsed on them, those who do not keep their hope on their meeting with Us, say: \"Bring to us a Quran other than this, or change this,\" say: \"It is not for me, to change it by myself: I follow nothing except what is made known to me: If I was to disobey my Lord, I should fear the penalty of a Great Day"
  10,16,"Say: \"If Allah had so willed, I should not have delivered it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. Surely, a whole life-time before now, I have been with you: Then will you not understand"
  10,17,"Who do more wrong than those who make up a lie against Allah, or deny His Signs? But those who sin will never prosper"
  10,18,"Besides Allah, they worship things that do not hurt them, nor help them, and they say: \"These are our intercessors (helpers) with Allah.\" Say: \"Do you really tell Allah something that He does not know, in the heavens or on earth? Glory to Him! And High is He above the partners they ascribe (to Him)"
  10,19,"Mankind was only one nation, but differed later. If it was not because of a Word from your Lord that came before their differences would have been settled between them"
  10,20,"And they say: \"Why is a Sign not sent down to them from their Lord?\" Say: \"The Unseen is only for Allah (to know). Then you wait: I will also wait with you"
