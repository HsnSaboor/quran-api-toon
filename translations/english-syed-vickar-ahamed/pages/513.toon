quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  48,16,"Say to the desert Arabs (Bedouins) who fell behind: \"You shall be called (to fight) against a people given to violent (and angry) war: Then shall you fight, or they shall surrender. Then if you shall show obedience, Allah will grant you a fair reward, but if you turn back as you did before, He will punish you with a painful penalty"
  48,17,"No blame or sin is there on the blind, nor is there blame on the lame, nor on one ill (if he does not join the war): And he who obeys Allah and His Messenger— (Allah) will admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow; And he who turns back, (Allah) will punish him with a painful penalty"
  48,18,"Indeed, Allah’s good pleasure was on the believers when they made (their sincere) promise to you under the Tree: He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down the peace and calmness upon them; And He rewarded them with a speedy Victory"
  48,19,"And many gains will they have (in addition): And Allah is Ever Almighty (Aziz, Supreme in Power), All Wise (Hakeem, Full of Wisdom)"
  48,20,"Allah has promised you many gains that you have captured, and He has given to you these earlier, and He has withheld the hands of men from you; That it may be a Sign for the believers, and that He may guide you to the Straight Path"
  48,21,"And (there are) other victorious (gains) that are not within your power, indeed Allah has foreseen them: And Allah is Always Able (Khadir) to do all things"
  48,22,"And if the unbelievers should fight you, they would certainly turn their back; Then would they find no protector and no helper"
  48,23,"That has been the Way of Allah, already with those (peoples) of the past: No change will you find in the Way of Allah"
