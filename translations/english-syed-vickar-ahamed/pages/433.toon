quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,40,"And the Day He will gather them all together, and say to the angels, \"Was it you that these men used to worship"
  34,41,"They (the angels) will say: \"Glory to You! — You are (our) Protector (Wali), not them. No! But they worshipped the jinns': Most of them (even) believed in them (jinns)"
  34,42,"So, today (the Day or Judgment), no one can help or harm each other: And We shall say to the wrongdoers, \"You taste the Penalty of the Fire; The one which you used to deny"
  34,43,"And when Our Clear Signs (verses) are recited to them, they say: \"Here is only a man who wishes to get in your way of the (worship) which your fathers practiced.\" And they say: \"This is only a lie that is invented!\" And about the Truth, when it comes to them the unbelievers say, \"This is nothing but clear magic"
  34,44,"And We had not given them the Books (of Scripture) that they could read (and understand), nor sent messengers to them before you as warners"
  34,45,"And their earlier generations rejected (the Truth): These have not received a tenth (of the Guidance) of what We had granted to those: Yet when they rejected My messengers how (terrible) was My rejection (of them)"
  34,46,"Say: \"I do warn (and advice) you on one point: That you stand up before Allah— (Either) in pairs, or as single (individuals)— And think deeply (within yourselves): Your Companion (the Prophet) is not possessed: He is no less than a warner to you, (as those) who will face a terrible Penalty"
  34,47,"Say: \"Whatever reward I might have asked from you is yours: My reward is only to come from Allah; And He is a Witness (Shaheed) over all things"
  34,48,"Say: \"Surely, my Lord sheds the (brightness of) truth (over some of His servants)— He, Who is All Knowing of what is hidden (Aa'lam- Al-Ghaib)"
