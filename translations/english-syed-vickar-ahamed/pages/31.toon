quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,197,"For the Pilgrimage, the months are well known. If anyone undertakes that duty, let there be no sign of offense, no wickedness, nor disputes during the Pilgrimage (Hajj). and whatever good you do, Allah knows it. And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best of provisions is right conduct. So fear Me, O! You, (people) who are wise"
  2,198,"It is no sin for you if you seek the bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage). Then when you come down from (Mount) Arafat, celebrate the Praises of Allah at the Sacred Mountain, and celebrate His Praise as He has directed you, even though, before this, you went astray"
  2,199,"Then move on at a quick pace from the place whence it is usual for the people to do so, and ask for Allah’s forgiveness. Verily, Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  2,200,"So when you have finished your (prescribed) duties of Hajj, celebrate the Praises of Allah, as you used to celebrate the praises of your fathers— Yes, with much more (feelings), heart and soul. Some men who say: \"Our Lord! Give us (Your bounties) in this world!\" But they will have no portion in the Hereafter"
  2,201,"And there are some men who say: \"Our Lord! Give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the severe pain of the Fire"
  2,202,To these (men) will be allotted what they have earned and Allah is quick in account
