  34,2,"He knows (all) that which goes into the earth, and (all) that which comes out from it; (All) that which comes down from the heaven, and (all) that which rises to it; And He is the Most Merciful (Ar-Raheem), the Often Forgiving (Al-Ghafoor)"
  34,3,"The unbelievers say: \"The Hour will never come to us;\" Say: \"No! By my Lord, but most surely, it will come upon you— By Him Who knows (everything) not (even) seen— From Whom is not hidden the smallest little (indivisible) particle in the heavens or on earth: And there is not a thing less than that, or greater, which is not clearly written in the Clear Book (Record)"
  34,4,"That He may reward those who believe and work deeds of righteousness: For such (persons there) is forgiveness and most generous ways (and means) to live"
  34,5,"But those who strive against Our Signs, to stop them (from success) in every way.— For such (persons there) will be a Penalty— A Punishment that is most humiliating"
  34,6,"And those to whom knowledge has come see that the (Revelation) sent down to you (O Prophet, is) from your Lord— That (it) is the Truth, and that it guides to the Path of the (One Allah) Supreme in Strength (Aziz), Worthy of all Praise (Hameed)"
  34,7,"(To mock) the unbelievers say: \"Shall we show you a man who will tell you, (that) when you are all thrown about in dust with total disintegration, that you shall (then be raised) in a New Creation"
