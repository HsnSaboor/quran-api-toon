quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the Fig and the Olive
  95,2,And the Mount of Sinai
  95,3,And the City (Makkah) of security —
  95,4,We have truly created man in the best of forms
  95,5,Then We bring him down (to be) the lowest of the low—
  95,6,"Except those who believe and do righteous deeds: For they shall have an unfailing reward"
  95,7,"Then what can be against you (O Prophet!), after this regarding the Judgment (to come)"
  95,8,Is Allah not the Wisest of judges
  96,1,"Proclaim! (And read aloud!) in the Name of the Lord and Cherisher, Who created —"
  96,2,"Created man, out of a (mere) clot of thickened blood"
  96,3,Proclaim! And your Lord is Most Bountiful —
  96,4,"He, Who taught (the use of) the pen—"
  96,5,Taught man that which he did not know
  96,6,Alas! But man oversteps all bounds
  96,7,And he considers himself as self-sufficient
  96,8,"Surely, to your Lord is the return (of all)"
  96,9,Do you see the one who forbids—
  96,10,A true believer when he (turns) to pray
  96,11,Do you see if he (Our servant) is on (the path towards) Guidance?—
  96,12,Or enjoins the right deeds
  96,13,Do you see if he stands against (the Truth) and turns away
  96,14,Does he not know that Allah sees
  96,15,"Let him become aware! If he does not stop, We will drag him by the hair (upon his forehead)—"
  96,16,"A lying, sinful hair"
  96,17,"Then, let him call (for help) to his own group (of friends)"
  96,18,We will call the angels of punishment (to deal with him)
  96,19,"But no! Do not pay any attention to him: But prostrate and bring yourself closer (to Allah)"
