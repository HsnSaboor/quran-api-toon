quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,1,"They ask you (O Muhammad) about (things taken as) spoils of war. Say: \"(Such) spoils (of war) are for Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad): So fear Allah, and settle the differences between yourselves (with fairness): Obey Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), if you do believe"
  8,2,"Those only are the believers who feel a tremor (and thrill) in their hearts when (the Name of) Allah is mentioned, and when they hear His Signs rehearsed, find their faith becoming strong, and place (all) their trust in their Lord"
  8,3,Who establish regular prayer and spend (freely) from the gifts We have given to them for (their) living
  8,4,"Like this are the true believers: They have grades of dignity with their Lord, and forgiveness, and generous sustenance"
  8,5,"Just like your Lord commands you to go away from your house in (the way of) truth, and surely, some of the believers disliked it"
  8,6,"Debating with you about the truth after it was made clear, as if they were pushed towards death and they (actually) saw it"
  8,7,"And (remember), Allah had promised you that one of the two (enemy) parties should be yours: You wished that the one unarmed should be yours, but Allah had willed to prove the Truth according to His words, and to cut off the roots of the disbelievers—"
  8,8,"That He might prove the Truth and prove what is false that amounts to nothing, even though it may be unpleasant to the guilty (criminal)"
