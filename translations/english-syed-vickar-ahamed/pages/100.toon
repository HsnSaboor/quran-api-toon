quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,135,"O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witness to Allah, even against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be (against) rich or poor: Allah protects you both (much) better. So follow not the desires (of your hearts), because you may swerve, and if you distort justice, or decline to do justice; Surely, Allah is Well Acquainted (Khabeer) with all that you do"
  4,136,"O you who believe! Believe in Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and the Book (the Quran) that He has sent down to His Messenger (Muhammad) and the Scripture (the Message) that He sent down to those before (him). Any (person) who denies Allah, His angels, His Books, His messengers, and the Day of Judgment, then indeed he has gone far, far astray"
  4,137,"Verily, those who believe, then (later) disbelieve, then believe (again) and (again) disbelieve, and go on increasing in disbelief— Allah will not forgive them, nor guide them on the (righteous) Way"
  4,138,To the hypocrites give the news that there is for them a painful Penalty—
  4,139,"To those who take for friends’ disbelievers rather than believers: Is it honor they seek among them? Surely, then all the honor is with Allah"
  4,140,"Already He has sent you the Word in the Book, that when you hear the Signs of Allah held in defiance and disrespect, You are not to sit with them (the disbelievers) unless they turn to different conversation: If you did, you would be like them. For Allah will collect the hypocrites and those who defy Faith— All in Hell—"
