quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and turned away
  80,2,"Because there came to him (the Prophet), the blind man (breaking into the discussion)"
  80,3,But what could tell you (O Prophet) but that he (the blind man) might by chance grow (in his understanding)
  80,4,Or that he may receive guidance and the teachings that might profit him
  80,5,About the one who considers himself independent
  80,6,You attend to him
  80,7,Even though there is no blame on you if he did not grow (in understanding)
  80,8,But to him (the blind man) who came to you with effort and sincerity
  80,9,And with fear (in his heart)
  80,10,Were you (O Prophet!) unmindful in shifting your attention to another
  80,11,"By no means (should it be so), because it is indeed a Message of Instruction"
  80,12,"Therefore let anyone who makes up the mind, remember (and accept) it"
  80,13,(It is) in Books held in (great) honor
  80,14,Supreme (in dignity) kept pure and holy
  80,15,(Written) by the hands of holy scribes (writers) —
  80,16,Blessed and just
  80,17,Warning to man! What has made him reject Allah
  80,18,From what stuff has He (Allah) created him
  80,19,"From a sperm-drop has He (Allah) created him, and then (He) makes him in proper size and shape"
  80,20,Then He (Allah) makes the path smooth for him
  80,21,Then He (Allah) causes him to die and puts him in his grave
  80,22,"Then, when it is His (Allah’s) Will, He will raise him up (again)"
  80,23,By no means has he (man) fulfilled what Allah has commanded him to do
  80,24,"Then let man look at his food, (how We provide it)"
  80,25,For that We pour forth water in plenty
  80,26,And We split the earth into pieces
  80,27,And produce from there corn
  80,28,And grapes and plants to eat
  80,29,And olives and dates
  80,30,And enclosed gardens thick with tall trees
  80,31,And fruits and herbage (and the grasses)—
  80,32,For you to use and (for your) help and for your cattle
  80,33,At last! When there comes the deafening noise—
  80,34,That Day man will run away from his own brother
  80,35,And from his mother and his father
  80,36,And from his wife and his children
  80,37,"On that Day each of the men, will have enough worry (of his own) to make him not mindful of the others"
  80,38,Some faces that Day will be shining
  80,39,"Laughing, being happy"
  80,40,And other faces that Day will be soiled with dust
  80,41,Blackness will cover them
  80,42,"Such will be the rejecters of Allah, the unrighteous"
