quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,21,"Thus We made their story known to the people, that they might know that the Promise of Allah is true, and that there may be no doubt about the Hour of Judgment. (Remember) they argued within about their affair. (Some) said, \"Construct a building over them:\" Their Lord knows best about them: Then those who were in control over their affair said, \"Surely, let us build a place of worship over them"
  18,22,"(Some) say they were three (youths), the dog being the fourth among them; And (others) say they were five, the dog being the sixth— Doubtfully guessing the unknown; And (yet others) say they were seven, the dog being the eighth. (O Prophet!) You say (to them): \"My Lord knows best their number; It is only a few who know their (real number).\" Therefore, do not enter into disputes about them, except about a matter that is clear, nor speak to any of them about (the affair of) the people of the Cave"
  18,23,"And do not say about anything, \"I shall surely do this and this tomorrow\"—"
  18,24,"Without (also saying), \"If Allah so wills!\" And call your Lord to mind when you forget, and say, \"I hope that my Lord will guide me ever closer (even) than this to the right road"
  18,25,"And they (the Sleepers) stayed in their Cave three hundred years, adding nine (more)"
  18,26,"(O Prophet!) say: \"Allah knows best how long they stayed: With Him is (the knowledge of) the secrets of the heavens and of the earth: How clearly He sees, how finely He hears! They have no protector other than Him; And He does not share His command and His rule with anyone (whomsoever)"
  18,27,"And recite (and teach) what has been revealed to you (O Prophet,) from the Book of your Lord: None can change His Words, and you will find none as a protector except Him"
