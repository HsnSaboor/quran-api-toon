quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun (with its spacious light) is folded up
  81,2,"When the stars fall, losing their glitter"
  81,3,When the mountains vanish (like a dream)
  81,4,"When the she camels, ten months with young are left untended"
  81,5,When the wild beasts are herded together (in human habitations)
  81,6,When the oceans boil over with a swell
  81,7,"When the souls are sorted out, (Put together, righteous with righteous and unrighteous with unrighteous)"
  81,8,"When the female (infant) buried alive, is questioned"
  81,9,For what crime she was killed
  81,10,When the books of deeds are laid open
  81,11,When the world on High (heavens) is made visible
  81,12,When the fire of Hell is set to a fierce burn
  81,13,And when the Garden (of the heavens) is brought near
  81,14,(Then) shall each soul know what it has brought (forward for this Day)
  81,15,So truly I call to witness the receding stars that hide away

  81,21,"With authority there, (and) faithful to his trust"
  81,22,"And (O people!), your companion (the Prophet) is not one who is possessed"

  81,24,And he does not withhold purposely any knowledge of the unseen
  81,25,And it is not the word of an evil spirit that is outcast
  81,26,"Where, then are you going"
  81,27,"Surely, this is the Message to (all jinns and men, all the) creations of the worlds"
  81,28,(With guidance) to each one among you who is willing to walk straight
