quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  44,40,"Surely, the Day of Sorting Out is the time appointed for all of them—"
  44,41,"The Day when the nearest of kin can be of no use to the related one, even the least, and no help can they receive"
  44,42,"Except such as those who receive Allah’s Mercy: Verily, He is Exalted in Might (Al-Aziz), Most Merciful (Ar-Raheem)"
  44,43,"Surely, the (evil) tree of Zaqqum"
  44,44,Will be the food of the sinful—
  44,45,Like molten brass; It will boil in their bellies
  44,46,Like the boiling of very hot water
  44,47,"(A voice will cry:) \"You seize him and drag him into the middle of the blazing Fire"
  44,48,Then pour over his head the penalty of boiling water
  44,49,"You taste (this)! Truly were you (all that) mighty, full of honor"
  44,50,"Surely, this is what you used to doubt"
  44,51,"Verily, as to the righteous, (they will be) in a position of security"
  44,52,Among Gardens and Springs
  44,53,"Dressed in fine silk and in rich lace, they will face each other"
  44,54,"Like this, (it will be!) We shall enjoin them the companions with beautiful, big and lovely eyes"
  44,55,There they can call for every fruit in peace and security
  44,56,"There, they will not undergo death, except the first death; And He will preserve them from the penalty of the blazing Fire—"
  44,57,As a Gift from your Lord! That will be the supreme achievement
  44,58,"Surely, We have made this (Quran) easy, in your tongue, in order that they may remember"
  44,59,"So you wait and watch, verily, they (too) are waiting"
