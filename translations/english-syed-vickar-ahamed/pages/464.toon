  39,48,"And for the evils of their actions will confront them, and they will be (completely) surrounded by that which they used to mock at"
  39,49,"When trouble comes to man, then he cries (and calls) to Us for help: When We give him a favor all by Ourselves, he says: \"This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge (I have)!\" No, but this is only a trial, but most of them do not understand"
  39,50,"Verily, the (people) before them talked like this! But everything they did was of no use to them"
