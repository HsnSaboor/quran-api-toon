quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,170,"When it is said to them: \"Follow what Allah has revealed:\" They say: \"No! We shall follow the ways of our fathers.\" What! Even though their fathers did not have the wisdom and guidance"
  2,171,"And the parable of those who reject Faith is similar to the one (shouting) like a shepherd who loudly shouts to things (cattle) that listen to nothing except calls and cries: Deaf, dumb, and blind, they do not have the wisdom"
  2,172,"O you who believe! Eat of the good things that We have provided for you, and be grateful to Allah if it is indeed He Whom you worship"
  2,173,"He has only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine and that on which any other name has been invoked besides that of Allah. But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience (of Allah’s Word), and without transgressing due limits— Then he is guiltless. Verily, Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  2,174,"Surely, those who hide Allah’s revelation in the Book, and purchase for them a miserable profit— They swallow into themselves nothing but Fire; Allah will not address them on the Day of Judgment, and will not purify them: Their Penalty will be painful"
  2,175,"They are the ones who buy error in place of Guidance and torment in place of Forgiveness: Oh! What boldness (they show) for Fire"
  2,176,(Their doom is) because Allah sent down the Book in truth but those who search the reasons of disputes in the Book are in a section far (from the purpose of truth)
