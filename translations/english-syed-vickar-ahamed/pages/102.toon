quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,148,"Allah does not love that evil should be talked (and spread in any form) in (any) place, in public speech, except by one against whom injustice has been done; For Allah is All Hearing (Sami’), All Knowing (Aleem)"
  4,149,"Whether you declare a good deed, or hide it or cover evil with pardon, surely Allah is Often Pardoning (‘Afuw), All Powerful (Khadir)"
  4,150,"Verily, those who deny Allah and His messengers, and (those who) wish to separate out Allah from His messengers by saying: \"We believe in some but reject others:\" And (those who) wish to take a course in between—"
  4,151,"They are, in truth disbelievers. And We have prepared for Unbelievers a humiliating Punishment"
  4,152,"To those who believe in Allah and His messengers and make no distinction between any of them, We shall soon give their (due) rewards: For Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  4,153,"The People of the Book ask you to make a book to come down to them from heaven: Indeed, they asked Musa (Moses) for an even greater (miracle), because they said: \"Show us Allah in public,\" but they were overpowered by what they had asked for, with thunder and lightning because of their wrongdoing. Then they worshipped the calf even after clear proofs had come to them; (Even) then We forgave them; And We gave Musa (Moses) clear proofs of authority"
  4,154,"And for their holy promise We raised over them (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai); And (on another occasion), We said: \"Enter the gate prostrating (bowing) with humility ;\" And (once again) We commanded them: \"Do not transgress in the matter of the Sabbath.\" And We took from them a truly holy promise"
