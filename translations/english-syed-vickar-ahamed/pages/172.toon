quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  7,164,"When some of them said: \"Why do you teach to a people whom Allah will destroy or come down with a terrible punishment?\"— Said the teachers: \"To fulfill our duty to your Lord, so that they may fear Him"
  7,165,"When they had rejected the warnings that were given to them, We saved those who prevented evil; But We came down upon the wrongdoers with a painful punishment, because they were given to transgression"
  7,166,"When in their haughtiness, they exceeded (all) that was prevented, We said to them: \"You be (like) monkeys, disliked and rejected"
  7,167,"And (remember), your Lord did (clearly) state that He would send against them, till the Day of Judgment, those who would hurt them with grievous penalty. Your Lord is quick in retribution (getting back), but (He) is also Often Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  7,168,"And We broke them up in sections on this earth. There are among them some who are the righteous, and some who are the opposite. And We have tried them with plenty and little (prosperity and adversity): So that they might turn (to Us)"
  7,169,"After them succeeded an (evil) generation: They took over the (holy) Book, but they chose the showy things of this world, saying (for excuse): \"(Everything) will be forgiven for us.\" (Even then), when similar things came their way, they would (once again) grab them. Was the sacred Promise of the Book not taken from them, that they would not say about Allah anything but the truth? And that they would study what is in the Book? And best for the righteous is the home in the Hereafter. Will you not understand"
  7,170,"And to those who hold fast to the Book and establish regular Prayer— Certainly, We shall never let the reward of the righteous to perish"
