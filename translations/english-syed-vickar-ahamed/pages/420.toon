quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  33,16,"Say: \"Running away will not help you, if you are running away from death or slaughter; And even then (if you do run away), you may be allowed to enjoy no longer than a short time"
  33,17,"Say: \"Who is it that can save you from Allah; If it is He wishes to give you punishment or (wishes) to give you Mercy?\" And, besides Allah, they will not find any protector or helpers for themselves"
  33,18,"Surely, Allah knows those (people) among you who hold back (others) and those who say to their brothers: \"Come along to us,\" while they do not come to fight except for only a little while"
  33,19,"Being stingy towards you; Then when the fear comes, you will see them looking to you with their eyes turning like (the eyes of a person) for whom death is near: But when the fear is gone, they will strike at you with their sharp tongues (with the) love of things. Men like this do not have faith, therefore, Allah has made their actions have no effect: And that is easy for Allah (to do)"
  33,20,"They think that the groups (opposing Islam) have not (lost and) withdrawn; And if those groups should come (again), they wish they were in the deserts together with the (wandering) Bedouins, and trying to find news about you (from far); And if they were in among you, they will fight very little"
  33,21,"In the Messenger (Muhammad) of Allah, you have a beautiful (pattern of conduct) and example for one whose hope is in Allah and the Final Day, and who Praises Allah much (often and deeply)"
