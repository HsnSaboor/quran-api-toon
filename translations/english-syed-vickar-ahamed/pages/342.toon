  23,5,"And those who guard their chastity, (And their private parts from immoral acts of sex)"
  23,6,"Except with those united to them by the bond of marriage, or (those) whom their right hands possess— For them, they are free from blame"

  23,13,"Then We placed him like (a drop of) semen firmly fixed, in a place of (its) rest"
  23,14,"Then We made the semen into a mass of half-solidified blood; Then from that mass We made an (early embryonic baby-like) lump: Then We made from the lump bones and covered the bones with flesh; Then We developed from it another creature, so blessed be Allah, the Best to create"
