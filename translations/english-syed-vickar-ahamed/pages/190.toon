quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  9,21,"Their Lord gives them the happy news of mercy from Himself, of His good pleasure, and of Gardens for them, where there are joys that will last (forever)"
  9,22,"They will live in there forever. Surely, in Allah’s Presence is reward, the greatest (reward of all)"
  9,23,"O you who believe! Do not have for protectors (and helpers) your fathers and your brothers if they choose Disbelief above Faith: If any of you do so, they do wrong"
  9,24,"Say: “If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your mates, or your children; The wealth that you have gained; The trade that you fear will go down: Or the house in which you have joy (and peace)— Are dearer to you than Allah, or His Messenger (Muhammad), or the hard work in His cause— Then wait till Allah brings out His decision: And Allah does not guide the rebellious.”"
  9,25,"Surely Allah did help you in many battle grounds and on the day of (battle at the town of) Hunayn: Look! Your large numbers made you very happy, but they did not help you a little bit: The land, being that it is wide, blocked you, and you turned back to withdraw (from war)"
  9,26,"But Allah did pour His peace on the Messenger (Muhammad) and on the believers, and sent down forces (angels) which you did not see: He punished the disbelievers: Like this He rewards those without Faith"
