  40,42,"You do call upon me to lie against Allah and to join with Him partners of whom I have no knowledge: And I call you to the Supreme in Power (Al-Aziz), the Often-Forgiving (Al-Ghafa’r)"
  40,43,"Without a lie! You do call me to one (the false god), who is not fit to be called to, either in this world, or in the Hereafter; And our Return will be to Allah; And those who exceed the limits will be companions of the Fire"

  40,47,"And they will fight with one another in the Fire! The weak ones (who followed) will say to those who had been proud (and arrogant), \"Verily, we only followed you: Can you then take (upon yourselves) from us some share of the Fire"
  40,48,"Those who had been proud (and arrogant) will say: \"We are all in this (Fire)! Truly, Allah has judged between (His) servants"
  40,49,"And those in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell: \"Pray to your Lord to lighten us the punishment (even) for a Day"
