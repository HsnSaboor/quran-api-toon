quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  35,31,"That which We have revealed to you of the Book it is (indeed) the Truth— Confirming what was (already revealed) before it: Verily, regarding His (slaves and) servants, Allah is All Aware (Khabir), All Seeing (Baseer)"
  35,32,"Then, We have given the Book to be passed down the generations to only those of Our servants as We have chosen: Then (even) there are among them, some who harm their own souls; And of them, some who take a middle course; And of them, some who are, by Allah’s permission, leaders in good deeds; That is truly, the highest grace"
  35,33,"Gardens of Paradise, they will enter: In there, they will be decorated with bracelets of gold and pearls; And (in) there, their garments will be of silk"
  35,34,"And they will say: \"All the Praise (and thanks) be to Allah, Who has taken away from us (all) misery and sorrow: Verily, our Lord is truly Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Appreciative (of good deeds and service, Shukoor)"
  35,35,"Who, out of His bounty, has placed us in a Home that will last forever: No hard work, nor (any) sensation of being tired shall touch us in here"
  35,36,"But those who disbelieve (and reject Allah)— For them (there) will be the Fire of Hell. No length of time shall be given to them, so that they may die, nor shall its penalty be made easy for them. Thus do We reward every ungrateful one"
  35,37,"Therein, they will cry loudly (for help): \"Our Lord! Take us out (of here): We shall work good deeds and righteousness, not the (things) we used to do!\"— (Their answer from Allah will be:) \"Did We not give you (a) life long enough so that, he who would (have listened), was warned? And (moreover) the warner came to you. So you taste (the rewards for your deeds): For the wrongdoers there is no helper"
  35,38,"Surely, Allah knows (all) hidden things of the heavens and the earth: Surely, He fully knows all that is within (men's) hearts"
