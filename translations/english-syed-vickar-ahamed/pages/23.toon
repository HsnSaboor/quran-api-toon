quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,146,The people of the Book know Muhammad this as they know their own sons; But some of them hide the truth that they themselves know
  2,147,The Truth is from your Lord; So do not be one of those who doubt
  2,148,"For each one is a direction to which they turn (in prayer); Then strive together (as in a race) towards all that is good. Wherever you are, Allah will bring you together; Truly, Allah has power over all things"
  2,149,"And, from where ever you start forth, turn your face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque (in Makkah); That is indeed the truth from your Lord. And Allah is not unmindful of what you do"
  2,150,"So from where ever you start forth, turn your face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque; And where ever you are, turn your faces towards it (as you pray): So that there be no reason for dispute against you among the people, except those of them who are the wrongdoers; So do not fear them, but fear Me; And that I may complete My favors on you, and you may (be willing to) be guided"
  2,151,"A similar (favor have you already received) in that We have sent among you a messenger (the Prophet) of your own, reciting to you Our Signs, and purifying you, and instructing you in Scripture and Wisdom, and in new Knowledge"
  2,152,Then do remember Me; I will remember you. And be grateful to Me and do not reject Faith
  2,153,"O you who believe! Seek (Allah's) help with Patience, Perseverance and Prayer: For Allah is with those who patiently persevere"
