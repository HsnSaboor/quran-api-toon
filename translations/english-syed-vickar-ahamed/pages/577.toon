quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,There will be no pleading or intercession from (any) pleaders (to) profit them
  74,49,Then what is the matter with them that they turn away from plain warning—
  74,50,As if they were frightened wild donkeys
  74,51,Running away from a lion
  74,52,"No doubt, each one of them wants to be given scrolls (of Revelation from Allah) spread out"
  74,53,By no means! But they fear not the Hereafter
  74,54,"Nay! Verily, this surely is a (stern) warning"
  74,55,Let any who will keep it (the warning) in memory
  74,56,"And they will not keep it in memory (mind) except as Allah wills: He is the One Who deserving the righteousness (with prayer and supplication to Him) and He is the One Who grants forgiveness (of the sins)"
  75,1,I swear by the day of Resurrection (when the dead shall be awakened)
  75,2,And I swear by the spirit that blames itself
  75,3,Does man think that We cannot assemble his bones together
  75,4,Yes! We are able to put together the very tips of his fingers perfectly
  75,5,But man wishes to do wrong (even) in the time (now) for the time that is to come
  75,6,"He asks: \"When is the Day (of Resurrection)on which the dead shall be awakened"
  75,7,"(Say:) \"Soon, when the sight is bewildered"
  75,8,And the moon is buried in darkness
  75,9,"And the sun and moon are joined together,\"—"
  75,10,"On that Day man will say: \"Where is the place to flee"
  75,11,By no means! (There will be) no place of safety
  75,12,"Before your Lord, that Day will be the place of rest"
  75,13,On the Day will man be told (all) that he put in front of him and all that he put behind
  75,14,No! Man will be (a true) evidence against himself
  75,15,Even though he may give his excuses
  75,16,Move not your tongue (O Prophet!) about the (Quran) to hurry on with it (in its reading)
  75,17,It is for Us to put it together and to make it known and be recited
  75,18,"And when We have it (known to you), then you follow its recitation (and form)"
  75,19,"Then, it is for Us to explain it (and to make it clear)"
