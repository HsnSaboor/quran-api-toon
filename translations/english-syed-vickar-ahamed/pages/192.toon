  9,34,"O you who believe! Truly, there are many of the priests and monks, who in (their) lies eat up the sustenance of men and block (them) from the Way of Allah. And there are those who bury gold and silver and do not spend it in the Way of Allah: Declare to them a most painful penalty—"
  9,35,"On the Day when heat will be produced from that (very wealth) in the fire of Hell, and with it will be burned on their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs.— \"This is the (wealth) which you buried for yourselves then you taste, the (wealth) you buried"
  9,36,"Verily, in the sight of Allah, the number of months (in a year) is twelve — So decided by Him, the day when he created the heavens and the earth; Of them (the twelve months) four are sacred: That is the proper religion. So do not go wrong yourselves about it: And fight the pagans (idolaters and polytheists) all together as they fight you all together. But know that Allah is with those who are pious (and hold themselves back from evil)"
