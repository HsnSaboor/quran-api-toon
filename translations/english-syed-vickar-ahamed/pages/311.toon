quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Have you then seen the (sort of) man who rejects Our Signs, yet says: \"I will truly be given wealth and children (if I was to be alive again)"
  19,78,"Has he gone into the Unseen (Ghaib), or has he taken a promise from (Allah) Most Gracious (Ar-Rahman)"
  19,79,"Nay! We shall record what he says, and We shall keep adding to his punishment"
  19,80,"And to Us shall return all that he talks about, and he shall come lonesome and alone, before Us"
  19,81,"And they have taken (for worship) gods other than Allah, that they may give them power and glory"
  19,82,"Instead, they (their false gods) shall reject their worship, and become enemies against them"
  19,83,"Do you not see that We have set the Evil ones (Satans) against the disbelievers, to make them (insane) with evil (and anger)"
  19,84,"So do not make haste against them, for We only count out for them a (few) number (of days)"
  19,85,"The Day We shall bring the righteous to (Allah) Most Gracious (Rahman), like a group brought before a king for honors"
  19,86,"And We shall drive the criminals (and sinners) to Hell, like thirsty cattle driven down to water—"
  19,87,"None shall have the power to plead (for them), except such a one, who has had permission from (Allah) the Most Gracious (Ar-Rahman)"
  19,88,"And they say: \"(Allah,) The Most Gracious (Ar-Rahman) has fathered a son"
  19,89,Indeed you (sinners) have brought forward a most horrible thing (and a lie)
  19,90,"As if the skies are ready to burst (open), the earth to split apart, and the mountains to fall down in total ruin"
  19,91,"That they assign (or give) a son for (Allah), the Most Gracious (Ar-Rahman)"
  19,92,For it is not befitting for the Majesty of (Allah) the Most Gracious that He should father a son
  19,93,"(There is) not (even) one being in the heavens and the earth that will not come to (Allah), the Most Gracious as (His) servant"
  19,94,"Verily, He (Allah) takes an account of them (all), and has numbered them (all) exactly"
  19,95,And everyone of them will come individually to Him on the Day of Judgment
