quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  31,20,"Do you not see that Allah has subjected to your (use) whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth, and has in a large part, made His gifts come to you (both as being) seen and unseen? Even then, there are from the men those who dispute (and argue) about Allah, without knowledge and without guidance, and without a Book to show the light to them"
  31,21,"When they are told to follow the (Book) that Allah has sent down, they say: \"No, we will only follow the ways that we found our fathers (following).” What! Even if Satan, was calling them (the fathers) to the penalty of the Fire"
  31,22,"And whosoever submits his entire face (self) to Allah, and is one who does good, then (he) has truly grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold: And with Allah are the end and the decision of (all) things"
  31,23,"And if anyone disbelieves (and rejects Faith), let not his rejection make you sad: All of them return to Us, and We shall tell them the truth of their actions: Verily, Allah is All Knowing (Aleem) of what is in their breasts (hearts)"
  31,24,"We give them their pleasure for some time: Then in the end shall We push them into a punishment that is terrible"
  31,25,"And if you ask them: \"Who created the heaven and the earth.\" They will certainly say: \"Allah.” Say: \"All Praises (and thanks) be to Allah!\" But most of them do not understand (the true meaning behind it)"
  31,26,"To Allah belongs everything in the heavens and the earth: Surely, He is Allah, Free of all wants (Al-Ghani), Worthy of all Praise (Al-Hameed)"
  31,27,"And if all the trees on the earth were pens and the ocean (were ink), with seven (more) oceans behind it to add to it, even so the Words of Allah will not be exhausted (in His Praise): Verily, Allah is All Mighty (Aziz), All Wise (Hakeem)"
  31,28,"And your being created or being raised up (for Judgment) is only as if it was for a single soul: Verily, Allah is All Hearing (Sami’), All Seeing (Baseer)"
