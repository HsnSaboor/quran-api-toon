  22,40,"Those who have been expelled from their homes (unjustly) in defiance of right— (For no reason) except that they say, \"Our Lord is Allah.\" Did Allah not stop one set of people by means of another, for sure, there have been destroyed, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, where the Name of Allah is praised most often. Allah will surely help those who support (His) cause— Because truly, Allah is Full of Strength (Qhavi), exalted in Might (Aziz)"
  22,41,"Those (are the believers) who, if We establish them firmly (in power) in the land, they establish regular prayer and give regular charity, enjoin the right and forbid wrong: And with Allah rests the end of (all) affairs"

  22,45,"And how many townships (or populations) have We destroyed, which were used to doing wrong? They fell down on their tops. And how many wells are lying idle and neglected, and the tall and well-built castles"
  22,46,"Do they not go through the land, so that their hearts can thus learn wisdom and their ears may thus learn to listen? Truly it is not their eyes that are blind, but their hearts that are in their chests"
