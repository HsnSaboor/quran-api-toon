quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,44,Or do you think that most of them listen or understand? They are only like cattle— No! They are worse astray in path
  25,45,"Have you not turned your sight (and thoughts) towards your Lord? How He pulls the shadow (longer during the evenings and mornings)! If He willed, He could make it fixed! Then We make the sun its guide (as it lengthens)"
  25,46,Then We draw it in towards Ourselves— A shortening by easy stages (during the night and noon)
  25,47,"And it is He Who makes the night as a (long) cover for you, and sleep as rest, and makes the day (like) a resurrection"
  25,48,"And it is He Who sends the winds as messages of glad news (and tidings), that go before His Mercy (of the rain), and We send down pure water from the sky—"
  25,49,"So that We may give life with it to the land that is dead, and quench the thirst of things We have created— Cattle and men in large numbers"
  25,50,"And indeed, We have distributed the (water) among them, in order that they may recite (Our) praises, but most men are ungrateful and denying"
  25,51,"And if it was Our Will, We could have sent a warner to every town"
  25,52,"Therefore do not obey the disbelievers, but work hard against them with the greatest strength, (with the Quran by your side)"
  25,53,"And it is He Who has released the two parts of flowing water; One (that is) drinkable and sweet, and the other (that is) salty and bitter; And He has set a barrier between them, a boundary forbidden to be crossed (by the waters)"
  25,54,"And it is He Who has made man from water: Then He has set up relationships of family and marriage: And your Lord is ever All Powerful (Khadir, over all things)"
  25,55,"And still, do they worship things besides Allah that can neither profit them nor harm them? And the disbeliever is a helper (of Evil), against his own Lord"
