quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,166,"And, whatever (loss) you suffered on the day (when) the two armies met, was with the permission of Allah, in order that He might test the believers—"
  3,167,"And that He may test the hypocrites also, they were told: \"Come, fight in the cause of Allah, or (at least) drive (the enemy from the city) and defend yourselves.\" They said: \"If we had known how to fight, we should certainly have followed you.\" On that day they were nearer to disbelief than to Faith, saying with their lips what was not in their hearts. And Allah has full knowledge of all they hide (in their hearts)"
  3,168,"(They are) the ones who said, (about the killed men) while they themselves sat (at ease): \"If only they had listened to us, they would not have been killed.\" Say: \"Hold back death from your own selves, if you speak the truth"
  3,169,Think not of those who are killed in Allah’s cause as dead. No! They live by finding their means (to live) in the Presence of their Lord
  3,170,"They are happy in the many gifts given (to them) by Allah: And with regard to those left behind, who have not yet joined them (in their peace and happiness), the (true believers) are happy because on them is no fear, nor have they (cause to) be sad"
  3,171,"They are happy in the Grace and the plenty of good things from Allah, and in the fact that Allah does not cause the reward of the faithful to be lost (in the least)"
  3,172,"Of those who answered to (the call of) Allah and the Messenger (the Prophet), even after being wounded, those who do right and refrain from wrong have a great reward—"
  3,173,"Men told them: \"A great army is gathering against you:\" And frightened them: But it (only) increased their Faith: And they said: \"For us Allah is enough, and He is the Best One to take care of affairs (Wakil)"
