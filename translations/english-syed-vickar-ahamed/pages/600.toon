quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,And whatever (locked up) in (human) breasts is made (clearly) evident—
  100,11,"That their Lord had been well aware of them, (even to) that Day"
  101,1,The (Day) of Noise and Chaos (of the Calamity)
  101,2,What is the (Day) of Noise and Chaos
  101,3,And what will explain to you what is the (Day) of Noise and Chaos
  101,4,(It is) a Day when men will be like moths thrown about
  101,5,And the mountains will be like torn wool
  101,6,"Then, he whose balance (of good deeds) will be (found) heavy—"
  101,7,Will be in a life of good pleasure and satisfaction
  101,8,But he whose balance (of good deeds) will be (found) light—
  101,9,Will have his home in a pit (of Fire)
  101,10,And what will explain to you what this is
  101,11,(It is) a Fire flaming fiercely
  102,1,The rivalry among yourselves for piling up diverts you (from your duties)
  102,2,Until you visit the graves
  102,3,"But no, you soon shall know (the reality)"
  102,4,"Again, you soon shall know"
  102,5,"No, if you were to certainly know within the mind (You would be aware)"
  102,6,You shall certainly see the Fire of Hell
  102,7,Again you shall see it with the certainty of sight
  102,8,"Then, shall you be questioned that Day about the joy (that you indulged in)"
