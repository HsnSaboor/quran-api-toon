quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,104,"When it is said to them: \"Come to what Allah has revealed, and come to the Messenger (Muhammad):\" They say: \"The ways we found our fathers following are enough for us.\" What! Even though their fathers did not have the knowledge and guidance"
  5,105,"O you who believe! Guard your own souls: If you follow (right) guidance, no pain (or sorrow) can come to you from those who have lost their way. The return for all of you is Allah: It is He Who will show you the truth of all that you do"
  5,106,"O you who believe!

If you doubt (their truthfulness) make them both stay after prayer, and let them both swear by Allah: “We do not wish for any worldly gain in this (matter) even though the (beneficiary) be our near relation: We shall not hide the evidence before Allah if we did, then look! The sin (will) be upon us!”"
  5,107,"But if it gets known that these two were guilty of the sin (of lying after their promise), let two others stand forth in their places— Nearest of kin from among those, who claim a lawful right: Let them swear by Allah: “We affirm that our witness is truer than that of those two, and that we have not altered (the truth) or gone beyond (the bounds of duty) if we did, then look! The wrong (will) be upon us!”"
  5,108,"That is most suitable: That they may give evidence in its true nature and shape, (and in its true meaning) or else they would fear that other statements would be taken after their statements. And fear Allah, and listen (with sincerity to His Word): For Allah does not guide people who are rebellious"
