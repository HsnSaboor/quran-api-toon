quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  10,43,"And among them are some who look at you: But can you guide the blind— Even though they will not see"
  10,44,"Surely, Allah will not deal unjustly with (any) man in the least bit: It is man who does wrong to his own soul"
  10,45,"And on the Day, when He will gather them together: (It will be) as if they had not stayed except by an hour of a day: They will recognize each other: Surely, those will be lost who denied the meeting with Allah and refused to receive Guidance"
  10,46,"Whether We show you (in this life) some part of what We promise them (that is the punishment)— Or We take (back your) soul— (to Our Mercy before that) in any case, their return is to Us: In the end, Allah is witness to all that they used to do"
  10,47,"And for every nation a messenger was sent when their messenger has come (and told them), the matter will be decided between them justly, and they will not be wronged"
  10,48,"And they say: \"When will this promise come true— If you (really) tell the truth"
  10,49,"Say: \"I have no power over any harm or gain to myself except as Allah wills. A term is fixed for every people: When their term is come, they can not postpone it by an hour, nor can they advance (it by an hour)"
  10,50,"Say: \"Do you see— If the punishment from Him should come to you by night or by day— Which part of it (punishment) would the sinners want to hasten"
  10,51,"At last, would you then believe in it, when it actually comes true?\" (It will then be said:) \"Well now? And you wanted to hasten it on"
  10,52,"In the end, (it) will be said to them, the wrongdoers: \"You taste the lasting punishment! You get only the repayment of what you earned"
  10,53,"And they would like to be told by you: \"Is that true?\" Say: \"Yes! By my Lord! It is the very truth! And you cannot escape from it"
