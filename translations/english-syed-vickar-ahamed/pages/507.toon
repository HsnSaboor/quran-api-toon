quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,Those who disbelieve (and reject Allah) and obstruct (others) from the Path of Allah— He (Allah) will make their deeds useless
  47,2,"But those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and believe in the (Revelation) sent down to Muhammad— For it is the Truth from their Lord— He will remove from them, their sins (and their ills) and improve their condition"
  47,3,"This is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, while those who believe follow the Truth from their Lord: This way does Allah bring out for men their lessons by similarity"
  47,4,"Therefore, when you meet the unbelievers [in a holy battle], strike (hard) at their necks; Till you have fully defeated (and finally felled) them. Place a bond firmly (on them): Thereafter (is the time for) either kindness or negotiation (with ransom): Until, the war lays down its burdens, (and it ends). Like this (are you commanded); But if it had been Allah’s Will, He (Himself) could certainly have ordered punishment for them; But (He lets you fight) in order to test you, some (to fight) with others. But those who are killed in the way of Allah— He will never let their deeds be lost"
  47,5,"Soon, He will guide them and improve their condition"
  47,6,And (He will) admit them to the Paradise that He has declared (especially) for them
  47,7,"O you who believe! If you will help (the Cause of) Allah, He will help you and plant your feet firmly (to make you strong)"
  47,8,"But those who disbelieve and (reject Allah)— For them awaits misery and destruction, and (Allah) will make their deeds useless"
  47,9,That is because they hate the Revelation of Allah so He has made their actions fruitless
  47,10,"Have they not traveled through the earth, and see what happened in the end of those before them (who did evil)? Allah brought total destruction on them, and similar (fate awaits) the disbelievers"
  47,11,"That is because Allah is the Protector (Maula) of those who believe, and verily the disbelievers have no protector"
