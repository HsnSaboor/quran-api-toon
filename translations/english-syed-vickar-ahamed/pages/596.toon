quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,None shall reach it except the most unfortunate ones
  92,16,Who give the lie to truth and turn their backs
  92,17,But those most devoted to Allah shall be removed far from it—
  92,18,Those who spend their wealth for increase in self-purification
  92,19,And have in their minds no favor from anyone for which a reward is expected in return
  92,20,But only the desire to seek the Approval of their Lord Most High (Rab-Al-A'la)
  92,21,And soon will they attain (complete) satisfaction
  93,1,By the Glorious Morning Light
  93,2,And by the night when it is still—
  93,3,"Your Guardian-Lord has not forsaken you (O Prophet), nor is He displeased"
  93,4,And surely the Hereafter will be better for you than the present
  93,5,And soon your Guardian-Lord will give you that with which you shall be well pleased
  93,6,Did He not find you an orphan and give you shelter (and care)
  93,7,"And He found you wandering, and He gave you guidance"
  93,8,"And He found you in need, and made you independent"
  93,9,"Therefore, do not treat the orphan with harshness"
  93,10,Do not shut off the beggar (without listening gently)
  93,11,But the Bounty of your Lord— Rehearse and proclaim
  94,1,"Have We not expanded for you (O Prophet), your chest"
  94,2,And removed from you your burden
  94,3,The (burden) that did strained your back
  94,4,And elevated your fame (in the eyes of the people)
  94,5,"So, surely with every difficulty there is relief"
  94,6,"Surely, with every difficulty there is relief"
  94,7,"Therefore, when you are free (from your immediate duties), continue in your hard work"
  94,8,"And to your Lord, turn (all) your attention"
