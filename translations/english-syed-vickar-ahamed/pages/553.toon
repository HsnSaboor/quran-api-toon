quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  62,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and on earth, glorifies of Allah,— The Sovereign King (Al-Malik), the Holy and Pristine (Al-Qudus), the Almighty (Al-Aziz), the All Wise (Al-Hakeem)"
  62,2,"It is He Who has sent amongst the unlettered ones a messenger from among themselves to rehearse to them His Verses, to purify them, and to instruct them in (Book, Quran) Scripture and Wisdom— Verily, they had been openly in error before"
  62,3,"And (He has sent the Prophet to) others among them (the Muslims ready to accept the Faith), who have not already joined them (the Muslims); And He is the Almighty (Al-Aziz), the All Wise (Al-Hakeem)"
  62,4,That is the Grace of Allah that He grants on whom He wills; And Allah is the Lord of the highest grace
  62,5,"The similarity of those who were entrusted and charged with the (obligations of the Judaic Law) Torah, but did not carry it (the trust) out, is (like) that of a donkey which carries voluminous scriptures (without understanding it). Evil is the likeness of people who falsify the Signs of Allah: And Allah guides not the wrongdoers"
  62,6,"Say: \"O you (Jewish people) who profess Judaism! If you think that you are friends to Allah, to the exclusion of (other believing) men, then express your desire for death, if you are truthful"
  62,7,"But they will not express their desire (for death), because of the (deeds) their hands have sent on before them! And Allah knows well the wrongdoers"
  62,8,"Say: \"Verily, the death from which you run away will really overtake you: Then will you be sent back to the All—Knower (Al-Aalam) of things that are unseen and seen: And He will tell you the things that you did"
