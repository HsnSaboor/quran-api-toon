quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,53,"It is like this We have tried some of them by others, in case they may say: \"Is it because Allah has favored these ones from among us?\" Does Allah not know best those who are grateful"
  6,54,"When those who believe in Our Signs (verses), come to you, say: \"Peace be on you: Your Lord has prescribed for Himself Mercy: Surely, in case you did evil in ignorance, there after you repent, and amend (your conduct), then truly He is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  6,55,"Like this do We explain the Signs (verses) in detail: That the way of the sinners may be manifest"
  6,56,"Say: \"I am forbidden to worship those— Other than Allah— Whom you call upon.\" Say: \"I will not follow your idle wishes: If I did, I would wander away from the Path, and (then I will) not be of the company of those who receive (true) guidance"
  6,57,"Say: \"For me, I (work) on a clear Sign from my Lord, but if you reject it, what (punishment) you would see hastened, is not in my power. The Command rests with none but Allah: He declares the Truth and He is the Best of judges"
  6,58,"Say: \"If what you see hastened was in my power, the matter would be settled at once between you and me. But Allah knows best those who do wrong"
  6,59,"And with Him are the keys of the Unseen, the treasures that no one knows but He. He knows whatever is in land and in sea. Not a leaf falls without His knowledge: There is not a grain in the darkness (or depths) of the earth, nor anything fresh or dry, except what is (written) in a clear record"
