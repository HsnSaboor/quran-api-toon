quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  12,70,"At the end, after he gave them the provisions (suitable) for them, he put the drinking cup into his brother’s saddle-bag. Then (one of) the announcers shouted: \"O you (in) the Caravan! Surely! Without doubt, you are thieves"
  12,71,"They (the brothers) said, turning towards them: \"What is it that you miss"
  12,72,"They said: \"We miss the great drinking cup of the king; For him who produces it, is (the reward of) a camel load (of grain); I will be bound by it"
  12,73,"(The brothers) said: \"By Allah! Indeed you know well that we did not come to make mischief in the land, and we are not thieves"
  12,74,"(The Egyptians) said: \"Then what will be the penalty for this, if you are (shown) to have lied"
  12,75,"They said: \"The penalty should be that he in whose saddle-bag it (the drinking cup) is found, should be held to make up for the (crime). It is like this that we punish the wrongdoers"
  12,76,"So he (Yusuf) began (the search) through their bags, before (he came to) the bag of his (full) brother: At the end, he brought it out of his (full) brother’s bag. Thus did We plan for Yusuf (Joseph). He could not take his brother by the law of the king except that Allah willed it (so). We raise to (different) levels (of wisdom) whom We please: But above all blessed with knowledge is One, the All Knowing (Aleem)"
  12,77,"They (the brothers) said: \"If he steals, there was a brother of his who did steal before (him).\" But Yusuf (Joseph) kept these things locked in his heart, without telling the secrets to them. He said (to himself): \"You are in worse position; And Allah knows best the truth of whatever you say"
  12,78,"They said (to the king): \"O high one! Verily! He has an old and respected father, (who will feel very sad without him); So take (and keep) one of us in his place; Indeed, we see that you are (kind) in doing good"
