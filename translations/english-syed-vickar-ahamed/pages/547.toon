quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  59,10,"And those who came after them say: \"Our Lord! Forgive us, and our brethren who came before us into the Faith (of Islam), and leave not in our hearts, hate (or sense of injury) against those who believed. Our Lord! You are indeed Full of Kindness (Ra'uf), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  59,11,"Have you not seen the hypocrites say to the disbelieving brethren among the People of the Book (Scripture)? \"If you are forced out, we will also go out with you, and we will never listen to anyone about your affair; And if you are attacked (in fight) we will help you.\" But Allah sees that they are indeed liars"
  59,12,"Surely, if they are forced out, never will they go out with them; And if they are attacked (in fight) they will never help them; And if they do help them, they will turn their backs; And they will not be victorious"
  59,13,"(Verily), you are stronger in their breasts (and hearts of hypocrites) than Allah (because of victories won by you). That is because they are men without understanding (for the Supreme Power of Allah)"
  59,14,"They will not fight you (even) together, except in fortified townships, or from behind walls. Their fighting (spirit) is strong among themselves: You would think they are united, but their hearts are divided. That is because they are a people who understand not"
  59,15,"They are like those who recently came before them, they have tasted the evil result of what they did; And (in the Hereafter there is) a painful penalty for them"
  59,16,"(Their friends deceive them), like the Satan, when he says to man, \"Deny Allah,\" but when (man) denies Allah, (the Satan secretively) says, \"I am free of you, I do fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds (Rub-ul-'Ala'meen)"
