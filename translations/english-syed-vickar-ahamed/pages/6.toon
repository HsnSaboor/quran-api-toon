quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,30,"And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels; \"I will create a vicegerent on earth.\" They said: \"Will You place in there, one who will make mischief and shed blood in there? While we (indeed) celebrate Your Praises and glorify Your Holy (Name)?\" He said: \"I do know what you do not know"
  2,31,"And He taught Adam the names of all things: Then He placed them before the angels and said: \"Tell Me the names of these (things) if you are right"
  2,32,"They said: \"Glory to You: We have no knowledge, except what You have taught us: Verily, in truth it is You Who are Perfect in knowledge and wisdom"
  2,33,"He said: \"O Adam! Tell them their names.\" When he had told them their names, Allah said: \"Did I not tell you that I know the (unseen) secrets of heavens and earth, and I know what you reveal and what you conceal"
  2,34,"And (remember) when We said to the angels: \"Bow down to Adam:\" And they bowed down: Except Satan, he refused and was haughty he was of those who reject Faith"
  2,35,"And We said: \"O Adam! You and your wife live in the Garden; And eat of the plentiful things in there (wherever and whenever) you want; But do not approach this tree, or you will run into harm and transgression"
  2,36,"Then Satan did make them slip from the (Garden), and get them out of the state (of joy) which they had been. We said: \"Get down, you all (people), with hostility between yourselves, on the earth; (that) will be your living-place and your means of livelihood — For a time"
  2,37,"Then Adam received the words of inspiration, from his Lord, and his Lord forgave him; For He is One Who accepts Repentance (Tawwab), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
