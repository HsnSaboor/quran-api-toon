  30,9,"Do they not travel in (and about) the earth; And see what was the end of those before them? They were superior (and) stronger than these (men): And they tilled the soil and populated it with more (men) than these (men): To them (the earlier people) came their messengers with Clear (Signs), (whom they rejected, to their own destruction): And it was not Allah Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves (their own souls)"
