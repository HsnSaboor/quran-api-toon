quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  49,12,"O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion (as much as possible): Indeed some (types of) suspicion are sins: And do not spy on each other, do not speak ill of each other, behind their backs. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? No! You would hate it... But fear Allah: Verily, Allah is One Who accepts repentance (Tawwab), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  49,13,"O mankind! We have created you from a single (pair) of male and female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another (not that you may hate each other). Surely, the most honorable of you, in the Sight of Allah is (he, who is) the most righteous of you. Verily, Allah is All Knowing (Aleem) and is Well-Aware (Khabir, of all things)"
  49,14,"The desert Arabs (Bedouins) say: \"We believe.\" Say: \"You have no faith: But you (only) say, ‘We have submitted our wills to Allah,’ because Faith has not yet come into your hearts. But if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not ignore the smallest of your deeds: Verily, Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  49,15,"Only those believers who have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and have never since doubted, but have worked hard with their belongings and their persons in the Cause of Allah. Those (believers)! They are the sincere ones"
  49,16,"Say: \"Will you instruct Allah about your Religion, while Allah knows all that is in heavens and all that is on earth? And Allah is All Knowing (Aleem) of all things"
  49,17,"They impress on you as a favor that they have joined Islam. Say: \"Count not your Islam as a favor upon me: No! Allah has handed down a favor upon you that He has guided you to the Faith, if you be true and sincere"
  49,18,"Surely, Allah knows the unseen secrets of the heavens and the earth: And Allah is the All Seeing (Baseer) of whatever you do"
