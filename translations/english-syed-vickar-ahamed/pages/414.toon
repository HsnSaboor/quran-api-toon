quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  31,29,"Do you not see that Allah blends the night into day and He blends the day into night? And He makes the sun and the moon obey (His Order), each running along its way for a time appointed? And that Allah is All Informed (Khabir) with what you do"
  31,30,"That is because Allah, He is the Truth, and because that which they invoke besides Him is falsehood; And that Allah— He is the Most High (Al-Ali’i), Most Great (Al-Kabir)"
  31,31,"Do you not see that ships sail through the Ocean by the Grace of Allah? That He may show you His Signs? Surely, in this, there are Signs, for all who (constantly) persevere and give thanks"
  31,32,"And when waves come over them like blankets, they (the men call to and) invoke Allah, giving Him (their) true prayers (and love). But when He has brought them safely to land, there are from them, those who stop midway between (right and wrong). And none deny Our Signs except those who break their promise and who are ungrateful"
  31,33,"O Mankind! Do your duty to your Lord, and fear the Day when no father can be even the least bit useful for his son, nor a son the least bit useful for his father. Surely, the Promise of Allah is true: Then, do not let this present life deceive you, nor let the Chief Deceiver (or Satan) deceive to you about Allah"
  31,34,"Surely, the knowledge of the Hour is (only) with Allah. It is He Who sends down the rain, and He Who knows what is in the wombs. Nor does anyone know what it is that he will earn tomorrow: Nor does anyone know in which land he will die. Surely, Allah is All Knower (Aleem), All Aware (Khabir)"
