quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,21,"And those who do not expect (their) meeting Us said: \"Why are the angels not sent down to us, or (why) do we not see our Lord?” Truly, they have a false opinion of themselves with rudeness in their great arrogance"
  25,22,"On the Day (when) they see the angels— There will be no joy for the sinners that Day: The (angels) will say: \"There is a limit totally banned (for you)"
  25,23,And We shall turn to those deeds they did and We shall make such deeds like floating dust thrown around
  25,24,"The companions of the Garden (Paradise) will be well that Day, in their Home, and have the most beautiful and the happiest of places for rest"
  25,25,"And the Day the heaven will be torn apart by clouds, and the angels shall be sent down, descending (in order and in grandeur)—"
  25,26,"That Day, the Sovereignty of right and truth, shall be (only) for the Most Merciful (Ar-Rahman): And it will be a Day of great difficulty for the disbelievers"
  25,27,"And the Day when the wrong-doer (of every type) will bite at his hands; He will say: \"Oh! If only I had taken a (Straight) path with the Messenger (of Allah)"
  25,28,Oh! I am (now in) misery! If only I had never taken such an (Evil) one as a friend
  25,29,"He led me astray from the Message (of Allah, even) after it had come to me! And Satan is only a traitor to man"
  25,30,"And the Messenger (Muhammad) will say: \"O my Lord! Truly, my people (took the Message lightly and) abandoned this Quran"
  25,31,"Like this We have made for every prophet an enemy from the criminals (and sinners): But your Lord is enough to guide and to help"
  25,32,"And those who reject Faith say: \"Why is Quran not sent to him all at once?\" (It is sent) like this so that We may give strength to your heart with it, and We have made it known to you in slow well-ordered stages, little at a time"
