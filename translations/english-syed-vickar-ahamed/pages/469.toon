  40,17,"That Day will every soul be given back what it earned; There will be no injustice on that Day, truly, Allah is Swift in taking account (Al-Hasib)"
  40,18,"And warn them of the Day, which is (always) coming closer, when the hearts will (come) right up to the throats to choke (the unbelievers): No close friend, nor anybody will the wrongdoers have to plead, who could be listened from"

  40,20,"And Allah will judge with (Justice and) Truth: But those whom (men) call upon besides Him (Allah), will not (be in a position) to judge at all. Surely, He is Allah, the All Hearing (As-Sami’), the All Seeing (Al-Baseer)"
  40,21,"Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the end of those before them?

  40,22,"That was because their (own) messengers (from Allah) came to them with clear proof, (evidence and signs), but they rejected them: So Allah called them to account (and punish them for their sins): Verily, He is All Strong (Qhavi), Strict in Punishment"
