quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,And if We (only) send a wind by which they see (their crops) become yellow— Behold! They become disbelievers
  30,52,"So surely, you cannot make the dead to hear, and (you) cannot make the deaf to hear, the Call (from Allah), when they show their backs and turn away"
  30,53,"And you cannot guide (bring back) the blind from wandering (without knowing where he is going): Only those can you make (them) hear, who believe in Our Signs and submit (themselves to Allah in Islam)"
  30,54,"It is Allah Who created you in weakness (as a helpless baby) then gave strength after the weakness, then gave weakness (again with your age) and head with gray (and torn hair) He creates what He wills, and He is the All Knowing (Al-Aleem), All Powerful (Al-Khadir)"
  30,55,"And on the Day that the Hour (of Judgment) will be (finally) set, those who exceeded the limits will swear that they idled away no longer an hour like this they were used to being fooled"
  30,56,"And those who are blessed with knowledge and faith will say: \"Indeed you remained within Allah’s Decree, to the Day for being raised (again), and this is the Day for being raised but you—you were not aware"
  30,57,"So, on that Day no excuse from them will be of use to those who exceeded the limits, and they will not be welcome to (Allah's) pleasure"
  30,58,"Surely, for men, We have set forth in this Quran, every kind of story (with a moral in it). But if you take any Sign (of Allah) to them, the unbelievers are sure to say (to the believers): \"You say nothing except useless (things)"
  30,59,Thus does Allah seal up the hearts of those who do not understand
  30,60,"So patiently remain constant (and firm): Surely, the Promise of Allah is true: And do not let those (unbelievers) who have no certainty of faith, move you from your firmness (of your Faith)"
