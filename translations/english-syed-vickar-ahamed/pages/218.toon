  10,79,"And said Firon (Pharaoh): \"Bring me every magician who is very good (in magic)"
  10,80,"And when the magicians came, Musa (Moses) said to them: \"You throw whatever you (want) to throw"
  10,81,"When they finished their throw, Musa (Moses) said: \"What you have brought is magic: Surely, Allah will make it have no effect: Verily, Allah does not grant success to the work of those who do evil and mischief"
  10,82,"And by His Words, Allah proves and establishes His Truth, however much the sinners may dislike it"
  10,83,"But no one believed in Musa (Moses) except some offspring of his people, because of the fear of men, Firon (Pharaoh) and his chiefs, in case they should punish them; And Firon (Pharaoh) was really arrogant and cruel on the earth and one who exceeded all limits"
  10,84,"Musa (Moses) said: \"O my People! If you (really) believe in Allah, then put your trust in Him (and) you bow (to His Will) if you are Muslims.”"
  10,85,"They said: \"We do put our trust in Allah. Our Lord! Do not make us a trial for those who act in cruelty and who are the wrongdoers"
  10,86,"And with Your Mercy, save us from those who reject (You)"
  10,87,"And We inspired Musa (Moses) and his brother with this message: \"Make homes for your people in Egypt, make your homes into places of worship, and practice regular prayers: And give the happy news to those who believe"
  10,88,"Musa (Moses) prayed: \"Our Lord! You have truly granted to Firon (Pharaoh) and his Chiefs fame and wealth in the life of the present, and so our Lord, they mislead (others) from Your Path. Our Lord! Destroy the power of their wealth, and send hardness (and suffering) to their hearts, so much so they will not believe till they have seen the great penalty"
