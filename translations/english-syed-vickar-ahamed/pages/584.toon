quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,"Listen, your Lord called out to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa:—"
  79,17,"You go to Firon (Pharaoh), because he has indeed exceeded all limits"
  79,18,"And say to him: ‘Would you (wish) that you should be purified (from sin)"
  79,19,"‘And that I guide you to your Lord, so you should fear Him?’”"
  79,20,"Then (Musa, Moses) showed him the great Sign"
  79,21,But (Firon) rejected it and disobeyed (the guidance)
  79,22,"Also, he turned his back, working hard (against Allah)"
  79,23,Then he collected (his men) and made a (false) claim
  79,24,"Saying, \"I am your lord, most high"
  79,25,"But Allah punished him, (and made) him an example— In the Hereafter, and in this life"
  79,26,"Surely, in this (instance) is a warning with guidance for those who fear (Allah)"
  79,27,What! Are you (men) more difficult to make than the heaven (that Allah) has created
  79,28,"High above has He raised its cover, and He has given it order and perfection"
  79,29,At night He grants its darkness and its brightness He brings out (with light)
  79,30,"And more, He has extended the earth (far and wide also in the shape of an egg)"
  79,31,He draws out its moisture from there and its grazing lands
  79,32,And the mountains He has firmly fixed—
  79,33,For use and benefit to you and your cattle
  79,34,"Therefore, when the great and fearful (event) comes"
  79,35,The Day when man shall remember all what he struggled for
  79,36,And the Fire of Hell shall be placed in full sight for (everyone) to see—
  79,37,Then for those that had exceeded all limits
  79,38,And (those who) had liked the life of this world
  79,39,The home will be the Fire of Hell
  79,40,And for those who had felt the fear of standing before their (Almighty) Lord and had restrained (their) souls from lowly desires
  79,41,Their home will be the Garden
  79,42,"They will ask you (O Prophet) about the Hour— \"When will be its appointed time"
  79,43,How are you (even included) in the announcement of its time
  79,44,Your Lord (Alone) knows the limit fixed for it
  79,45,You are only a warner for those who fear it
  79,46,"The Day when they see it, (it will be) as if they had waited for it a single evening, or the following morning"
