quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,17,"Have patience at what they say, and remember Our servant Dawood (David), the man of (great) strength; Verily, he always came back in repentance (to Allah)"
  38,18,"Verily, We made the hills recite Our Praises together with him, in evening and at break of day"
  38,19,"And all the birds gathered (in flocks), did turn (to Allah) with him (Dawood)"
  38,20,"We made his kingdom strong and gave him wisdom, and good judgment in what he talked and what he decided"
  38,21,"And, has the story of the (two) who disagreed reached you? When they climbed over the wall of the private room (where he prayed)"
  38,22,"When they entered in presence of Dawood (David), and he was frightened of them, they said: \"Fear not: We are two litigant (who disagree), one of us has wronged the other: Therefore, decide between us now with truth, and do not treat us with injustice, and guide us to the Right way"
  38,23,"Verily, this man is my brother (in religion): He has ninety and nine ewes (female sheep), and I have (only) one: Yet he says; 'Leave her (the one sheep) to me,' and (also he) is rude to me when he talks"
  38,24,"(Dawood) said: \"Without a doubt he has done wrong to you by asking you for (the single) sheep to add to his (flock of) sheep: And truly, there are many partners (in business) who do wrong to each other, except those who believe and work deeds of righteousness do not act like that, and how few are they?\"... And Dawood (David) gathered that We had tried him, and he asked forgiveness from his Lord, and he fell down, bowing (in prostration), and turned (to Allah in repentance)"
  38,25,"So, We forgave him (for) this: And he really enjoyed an extreme closeness to Us, and a Beautiful Place of (final) Return"
  38,26,"Oh Dawood (David)! Verily, We truly made you a successor and leader on earth: So you judge between men in truth (and justice): And do not follow the (idle) desires (of your heart), for they will take you away from the Path of Allah: Verily, those who go away from the Path of Allah, (there) is a painful penalty, because they forget the Day of Reckoning (and Account)"
