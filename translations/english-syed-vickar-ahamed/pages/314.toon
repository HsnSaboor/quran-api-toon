  20,40,"When your sister went out and said: ‘Shall I show you one who will nurse and bring up the (child)’? So We brought you (Moses) back to your mother, so that her eye might be cooled and she should not be sad. Then you did kill a man, but We saved you (O Musa!) from great suffering, and We tried you in many ways. Then you waited a number of years with the people of Madyan. Then you came here after the term I (Allah) had decided (for you), O Musa (Moses)"
