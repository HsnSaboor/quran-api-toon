  3,149,"O you who believe! If you listen to the Unbelievers, they will drive you back on your heels, and you will turn back (from Faith) to your own loss (as the losers)"

Among you are some who desire this world and some that desire the Hereafter. He diverted you from your enemies in order to test you. Yet surely, He forgave you: And Allah is full of Grace to those who believe"
  3,153,"And (remember) when you were climbing up the high ground, without even taking a side look at anyone, and from behind, the Messenger (the Prophet) from the rear was calling you back.

For Allah is All Aware (Khabeer) of all that you do"
