quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,152,"And do not come near to the orphans property except to improve it (or to make it better), till he (or she) attains the age of full strength; Give full measure and full weight with (total) justice— No burden do We place on any soul, except that what it can bear— And whenever you speak, speak justly, even if a near relative is concerned; And fulfill the duty (and promise) to Allah: Thus does He command you, that you may remember"
  6,153,"And surely, this is My Way, leading (you) Straight: Follow it: (And) follow not (other) paths: They will scatter you from His (straight) Path: Thus He commands you, that you may be Righteous"
  6,154,"Then, We gave Musa (Moses) the Book (Torah), completing (Our favor) to those who would do right, and explaining all things in detail— And a guide and a blessing, that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord"
  6,155,"And this is a blessed Book (the Quran) that We have revealed as a blessing: So follow it and be righteous, that you may (also) receive mercy"
  6,156,"In case that you should say: \"The Book was sent down to two sects before us, and for our part, we remained unaware with all that they learned by serious study"
  6,157,"Or in case that you should say: \"If the Book had only been sent down to us, we should have followed its guidance better than they (did).\" Now then, has come to you a clear (proof, this Quran) from your Lord, and a guide and a mercy: Then who could be more wrong than one who rejects Allah’s Signs, and turns away from it? In good time We shall punish those who turn away from Our Signs (verses), with terrifying penalty, for their turning away"
