quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,137,This is nothing different from the customary actions of the ancient (people)
  26,138,And we are not the ones to take pains and penalties
  26,139,"So they rejected him, and We destroyed them. Surely there is a Sign in this but most of them do not believe"
  26,140,"And surely your Lord is He (Who is) the Almighty (Al-Aziz), the Most Merciful (Ar-Raheem)"
  26,141,The Samood (Thamud people) rejected the messengers
  26,142,"When their brother Salih said to them: \"Will you not fear (Allah)"
  26,143,I am to you a messenger fit for all trust
  26,144,"So fear Allah, and obey me"
  26,145,"I do not ask for any reward for it from you: My reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds (Rab-ul-'Ala'meen)"
  26,146,"Will you be left safe (for ever), in (the enjoyment of) all that you have here"
  26,147,In gardens and springs
  26,148,And corn-fields and date palms with their (leafy) covers almost breaking (with the weight of fruit)
  26,149,And you dig out houses out of (rocky) mountains with high skill
  26,150,But fear Allah and obey me
  26,151,And do not follow the call of those who are wasteful—
  26,152,"Who do mischief in the land, and do not correct (their ways)"
  26,153,"They said: \"You are only one of those under a (magical) spell"
  26,154,"You are no more than a human like us: \"Then bring us a Sign, if you tell the truth"
  26,155,"He said: \"Here is a she-camel: She has a right to (come to the) water, and you have a right to (come to the) water, on a day appointed"
  26,156,"And do not touch her with harm, or the penalty of the Great Day seize you"
  26,157,"But they killed her (by cutting the hamstrings): Then they became full of sorrow"
  26,158,"But the penalty seized them, surely there is indeed a Sign in this but most of them do not believe"
  26,159,"And surely your Lord is He (Who is), the Almighty (Al-Aziz), the Most Merciful (Ar-Raheem)"
