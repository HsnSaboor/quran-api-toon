quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,191,"And slay them (who fight against Allah’s cause) wherever you catch them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out; For persecution and injustice are worse than killing. But do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque, unless they (first) fight you there; But if they fight you slay them. Such is the reward of those who block Faith"
  2,192,"But if they cease, then Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  2,193,"And keep fighting them until there is no more persecution and injustice. And justice and faith in Allah continues; But if they cease, let there be no hostile acts except against those who (always) practice (hostilities and) injustice"
  2,194,"The prohibited month:— For the prohibited month— And likewise for all things prohibited— The Law of Equality applies. If then anyone violates the prohibition against you, (then) you transgress likewise against him. But fear Allah, and know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves"
  2,195,"And from your (own) wealth, spend in the cause of Allah, and make not your own hands contribute to (your) destruction; But do good: Because Allah loves those who do good"
  2,196,"And complete the Pilgrimage or Umrah (a pious visit to the Sacred Mosque) in the service of Allah. But if you are prevented (from completing it), send an offering for sacrifice, what you may find (and afford): And do not shave your heads until the offering reaches the place of sacrifice. And if any of you is ill, or has an ailment in his scalp, (requiring to shave, he should) in compensation either fast, or feed the poor, or offer sacrifice; And when you are in peaceful conditions (again), if anyone wishes to continue the Umrah on to Pilgrimage (Hajj), he must make an offering, what he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, he should fast three days during the Hajj and seven days on his return, making ten days in all. This is for those whose household is not in (the immediate closeness to) the Sacred Mosque. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is strict in punishment"
