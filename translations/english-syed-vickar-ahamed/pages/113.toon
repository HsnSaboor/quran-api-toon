  5,32,"On that basis: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if anyone killed a person— Unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land— It would be as if he killed all mankind (the people): And if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind (the people). Then although there came to them Our messengers with Clear Signs, yet even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses (and do injustices) in the land"
  5,33,"The punishment for those who wage a war against Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and work hard with strength and taste for mischief through the land, is: Execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: That is their disgrace in this world, and their punishment is heavy in the Hereafter"
  5,34,"Except for those who repent before they fall into your power: In that case, know that Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  5,35,"O you who believe! Do your duty towards Allah, find the ways to come close to Him, and work hard with (all your) strength and will in His cause: That you may prosper"
  5,36,"Surely, those who reject Faith— If they had everything on earth, and twice again, to offer to save them, from the penalty of the Day of Judgment, it would never be accepted from them. Theirs would be a painful Penalty"
