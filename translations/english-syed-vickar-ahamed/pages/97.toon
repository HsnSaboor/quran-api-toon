quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"There is no good in most of their secret talks: Except if one thinks of a deed of charity, or of justice, or of bringing men together: To (the person) who does this for the good pleasure of Allah, We shall soon give him a reward of the highest (value)"
  4,115,"If anyone opposes (and contradicts) the Messenger (Muhammad) after guidance has been plainly given to him, and follows a path that is different from the one for the men of Faith, We shall leave him in the path he has chosen and put him in Hell, what an evil refuge"
  4,116,"Verily, Allah does not forgive (the sin of) joining other gods with Him; But He forgives (those) Whom He pleases sins other than this (sin): The one who joins other gods with Allah, has strayed far, far away (from the Right)"
  4,117,"(The pagans), leaving Him (Allah), seek out female goddesses: And they only seek out only Satan, the persistent rebel"
  4,118,"Allah did curse him (Satan), and he said: \"I will take from Your servants a portion marked off"
  4,119,"Verily, I will mislead them, and surely, I will create in them false desires; And certainly, I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and surely, I will order them to spoil the (fair) nature created by Allah.\" Whoever, by rejecting Allah, takes Satan for a friend, instead of (taking) Allah, (he) has surely suffered a clear loss"
  4,120,"He (Satan), makes promises to them, and creates in them false desires; And Satan’s promises are nothing but deception (and falsehood)"
  4,121,"They (friends of Satan) will have their homes in Hell, and from it they will find no way of escape from it"
