quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,195,"And their Lord has accepted from them, (and answered them:) \"Never will I cause the work of any of you to be lost, whether male or female: You are (members), one of another: Those who have left their homes, and been driven out from there, and suffered harm in My Cause, and fought and been slain— Truly, I will remove from them their (stains of) injustices, and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing beneath— A reward from the Presence of Allah, and from Allah is the best of rewards.”"
  3,196,Let not the idle talk of the Unbelievers through the land deceive you
  3,197,"Little is it for enjoyment: Their final home is Hell: What an evil bed (to lie on)"
  3,198,"On the other hand, for those who fear their Lord, are Gardens, with rivers flowing beneath; In there are they to live (for ever)— A gift from Allah; And that which is with Allah is the best (of happiness) for the righteous"
  3,199,"And there are, certainly, among the People of the Book, those who believe in Allah, in what has been revealed to you, and in what has been revealed to them, bowing in humility (love and obedience) to Allah: They will not sell the Verses of Allah for a low price (miserable gain)! For them is a reward with their Lord, surely, Allah is swift in account"
  3,200,O you who believe! Endure and be more patient (struggle on with patience and constancy;) complete in such struggles; — Strengthen each other; And fear Allah; That you may prosper
