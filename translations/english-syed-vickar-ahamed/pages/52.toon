quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,16,"Those who say: \"Our Lord! We have indeed believed: So forgive us, for our sins, and save us from the punishment of the Fire;\"—"
  3,17,"Those who show patience, firmness and self control; Who are true (in word and deed); Who pray with sincerity (and obedience); Who spend (in the way of Allah): And who pray for forgiveness in the early hours of the morning"
  3,18,"By the Witness of Allah; There is no god but He: (That is the witness of) His angels, and those gifted with knowledge, standing firm on justice, there is no god but He, the Almighty (Al-Aziz), the All Wise (Al-Hakeem)"
  3,19,"The (true) Religion with Allah is Islam (submission to His Will), the People of the Book did not differ, except by the envy of each other, after knowledge had come to them. But if any deny the Signs of Allah, Allah is quick in calling to account"
  3,20,"So if they disagree with you, say: \"I have submitted my whole self to Allah, and so have those who follow me.\" And say to the People of the Book and to those who have not yet learned: \"Do you (also) submit yourselves?\" If they do, they are in right guidance, but if they turn away, your duty (O Prophet) is to convey the Message; And Allah is All Seeing (Baseer), for all His servants"
  3,21,"Verily, those who deny the Signs of Allah, and without (any justice or) right kill prophets, and kill those who teach just dealing with Mankind, tell them about a grievous penalty"
  3,22,"They are those whose works will bear no fruit in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help"
