quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  17,18,"If any (of you) wish for the passing things (of this life), We give him readily— Those things as We will, to those persons as We will: In the end, We have (also) made Hell for him: He will burn in there, disgraced and rejected"
  17,19,"Whosoever wishes for the (reward in) Hereafter, and works hard for it with all his due effort, and keeps (his) Faith— He is the one whose effort is acceptable (by Allah)"
  17,20,"From the (many) gifts of your Lord, We give freely to all— These (people) as well as those (people): The gifts of your Lord are not limited (to any)"
  17,21,See how We have given more to some than to others; But surely the Hereafter is higher in value and position and greater in excellence
  17,22,Do not take with Allah another god for worship; Or you (O man!) will sit in disgrace and neglect
  17,23,"And your Lord has commanded that you worship none but Him. And that you be kind to your parents. Whether one or both of them reach old age in your life, do not say a word of (hate and) disrespect to them, and do not brush them aside, instead, talk to them with (respect and) honor"
  17,24,"And, (out of kindness), lower to them the arm of submission by being humble through mercy, and say: \"My Lord! Grant to them Your Mercy as they brought me up (dearly) during my childhood"
  17,25,"Your Lord knows best what is in your hearts and souls: If you do deeds of righteousness, then surely He is Most Forgiving to those who turn to Him again and again (in true repentance)"
  17,26,"And give the relatives their due rights, and (also) to those in want, and to the wayfarer: But do not waste (your wealth) like a spendthrift (or a wasteful person)"
  17,27,Surely wasters are brothers of the Satans'; And the Evil one (the prime Satan) is ungrateful to his Lord
