quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,"So, no friend does he have here this Day"
  69,36,Nor does he have any food (here) except the corruption from the washing of wound
  69,37,Which none do eat except those who have sinned
  69,38,"So, I swear by what you see"
  69,39,And what you see not
  69,40,"That this is truly the word of an honorable Messenger (of Allah, the Prophet Muhammad)"
  69,41,"It is not the word of a poet: Little it is you believe"
  69,42,"Nor is it the word of a soothsayer (or a fortune teller): Little warning (and advice) it is, that you receive"
  69,43,(This is) a Message sent down from the Lord of the Worlds (Rab-ul-'Ala'meen)
  69,44,And if he (the Messenger) were to invent any saying in Our Name
  69,45,We should certainly have seized him by his right hand
  69,46,And then We certainly would have cut off the artery of his heart
  69,47,Nor could any of you withhold him (from Our Anger)
  69,48,But truly this is a Reminder (the Quran) for those who fear Allah
  69,49,"And We certainly, know that there are among you those who reject (it)"
  69,50,"But truly, it (the Reminder, this Quran) is a cause of sorrow for the unbelievers"
  69,51,"And verily, it (the Quran) is the Truth of total certainty"
  69,52,So glorify the Name of your Lord the Most Great (Rab-ul-Azeem)
  70,1,A questioner asked about the penalty to befall (yet to happen)—
  70,2,Upon the unbelievers— There is none that can avert (the penalty)—
  70,3,"(A penalty) from Allah, Lord of the Ways of Ascent"
  70,4,"The angels and the Spirit [Ruh, Gabriel] rise up to Him in a Day whose measure is fifty thousand years"
  70,5,Therefore you stay patient— With a good Patience (of beautiful contentment)
  70,6,They see the (Day) indeed as a far-off (event)
  70,7,But We see it (quite) near
  70,8,The Day that the sky will be like molten brass
  70,9,And the mountains will be like wool
  70,10,And no friend will ask about a friend
