quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,58,"And (remember) when, We said: \"Enter this town, and eat from the plentiful in there as you wish; But enter the gate with humility, in (your) way and in (your) words, and We shall forgive you for your faults and increase (the portion of) those who do good"
  2,59,"But those who transgressed, changed the words from those (words) that were given to them; So We sent on those who transgressed a plague from heaven, because they disobeyed (Our command) repeatedly"
  2,60,"And (remember) when, Musa (Moses) prayed for water for his people; We said: \"Strike the rock with your staff.\" Then gushed forth from there twelve springs. Each group knew its own place for water. So eat and drink from the sustenance provided by Allah, and do not practice evil or mischief on the (face of the) earth"
  2,61,"And (remember) when, you said: \"O Musa (Moses)! We cannot endure one kind of food (always); So pray to your Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth grows— Its pot-herb(s), and cucumber(s), its garlic, lentils, and onions.\" He said: \"Will you exchange the better for the worse? You go down to Misr (any town), and you shall find what you want!\" They were covered with humiliation and misery; They drew the anger of Allah on themselves. That was because they kept rejecting the Signs of Allah and killing His Messengers without just cause. That was because they rebelled and went on transgressing"
