quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,60,"Have you not seen those (hypocrites) who declare that they believe in the Revelations that have come to you and to those before you? Their (real) wish is to resort together for judgment (in their disputes) to the false judges (and the Satan), though they were ordered to reject them (and him). But Satan's wish is to lead them far astray (from the right)"
  4,61,"And when it is said to them: \"Come to what Allah has revealed, and to the Messenger (Muhammad):\" You see the hypocrites turn their faces from you in disgust"
  4,62,"How then, when they are seized by misfortune, because of the deeds which are the acts of their own hands? Then they come to you, swearing by Allah: \"We only meant good-will and conciliation"
  4,63,"Those men— (the hypocrites) are the ones whom Allah knows what is in their hearts; So keep away from them, but warn them, and speak to them a word that reaches their very souls"
  4,64,"We did not send a messenger, but only to be obeyed, in accordance with the Will of Allah. If they had only come to you when they were unjust to themselves, and asked for Allah’s forgiveness, and the messenger had asked for forgiveness for them, (then) they would have found Allah is Forgiving and accepts repentance (Tawwab), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  4,65,"But no! By your Lord, they can have no (real) Faith, unless they make you judge in all disputes between them, and find no objections in their souls against your decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction"
