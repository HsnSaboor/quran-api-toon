  12,16,And they came crying to their father in the early part of the night
  12,17,"They said: \"O our father! We went racing with one another, and left Yusuf (Joseph) with our things; And the wolf ate (devoured) him... But you will never believe us even though we tell the truth"
  12,18,"And they brought his shirt stained with false blood. He said: \"No, only (you) yourselves have made up a story (that may sound alright) for you. (As for me) patience is most suitable: And against (the lie) what you keep saying, it is Allah Whose help can be prayed for"
  12,19,"And there came a group of travelers: They sent their water-bearer (for water), and he let down his bucket (in the well)... He (the bearer) said: \"Oh there! Good news! Here is a (handsome) boy!\" So they kept him hidden like a treasure! But Allah knew well all that they did"
  12,20,"And the (travelers) sold him for a low price— For a few dirhams (that were) counted out: They were those who held him in such a low value"
  12,21,"And he (the man) in Egypt who bought him, said to his wife: \"Make his stay (respectful and) honorable: Maybe he will bring us a lot of good, or we shall make him an adopted-son.\" Like this We made a place for Yusuf (Joseph) in the land, so that We might teach him the interpretations (the true meaning) of the stories (and events). And Allah has full power and control on His affairs; But most of mankind do not know it"
  12,22,"And when he [Yusuf, (Joseph)] reached his full manhood, We gave him power and knowledge: Like this We reward those who do right"
