quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,And Our Command is but a single (Act)— Like the twinkle of an eye
  54,51,"And indeed (often) in the past, We have destroyed groups like you: Then is there any who will receive the teachings"
  54,52,And all that they do is noted in (their) books (of deeds)
  54,53,"And every matter, small and large, is on record"
  54,54,"Verily, as to those who act right, they will be in the in the midst of gardens and streams"
  54,55,"In an Assembly of Truth, in the Presence of a Sovereign Almighty (Muqtadir, Omnipotent Allah)"

  55,2,It is He Who has taught the Quran
  55,3,He has Created man
  55,4,He has taught him to talk (and understand)
  55,5,The sun and the moon that follow (their) calculated courses
  55,6,And the herbs (also the term for galaxy of stars) and the trees —Both prostrate (bow) themselves in respect (to Allah)
  55,7,"And the Arch of the Sky — He has raised high (above), and He has set up the balance (of Justice)"
  55,8,So that you may not willfully overstep (the fine) balance
  55,9,So establish (accurate) weight with justice and do not fall short in the balance
  55,10,It is He Who has spread out the earth for (His) Creatures
  55,11,"In there is fruit and date-palms, producing the long leaves (enclosing dates)"
  55,12,"Also corn, with (its) leaves and stalks for feeding the cattle and the sweet smelling plants"
  55,13,Then which of the miracles from your Lord will you both (men and jinns') renounce?—
  55,14,He created man from sounding clay like the clay of pottery
  55,15,And He created jinns' from a smokeless flame of fire
  55,16,Then which of the miracles from your Lord will you both renounce? —
