quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,26,"And remember when you were few (a small group), not well liked through out the land, and afraid that men might rob and take you away (by force); But He provided a place of safety for you, strengthened you with His help, and gave you good things for living; That you may be thankful"
  8,27,"O you who believe! Do not betray to the trust of Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad), and do not steal (or cheat) knowingly from the things given to you in trust"
  8,28,"And you know that the things you own, and your children (descendants) are only a trial; And that it is Allah with Whom is your highest reward"
  8,29,"O you who believe! If you fear Allah, He will give you a basis (to judge between right and wrong), (He will) remove from you the evil (that may be close to) you, and forgive you: And Allah is the Lord of unlimited grace"
  8,30,"And (remember) how the disbelievers planned against you, to put you in prison, or to kill you, or get you out (of your home, Makkah). They plotted and planned, and Allah also plotted but the best of planners is Allah"
  8,31,"When Our verses are read to them, they say: \"We have heard this (before): If we wanted, we could say (words) like these: These are nothing but old stories"
  8,32,"And (remember) when how they said: \"O Allah! If this is indeed the Truth from You, then rain down on us a shower of stones from the sky, or send us a painful penalty"
  8,33,And Allah was not going to send them a penalty while you (O Muhammad) were with them; And He was not going to punish them when they could ask for pardon
