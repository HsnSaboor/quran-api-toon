quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,Though they will be put in sight of each other— The sinners (only) wish will be that he could save himself from the penalty of that Day by (even offering) his children
  70,12,His wife and his brother
  70,13,And his relatives who sheltered him
  70,14,"And all, all that is on earth— So that it could save him—"
  70,15,"By no means! Verily, it would be the Fire of Hell"
  70,16,Tearing out (his existence) right out of his skull
  70,17,Inviting (all) those who turn their backs and turn away their faces (from the right)
  70,18,And collect (wealth) and hide it (from use for Allah)
  70,19,"Truly, man was created very impatient—"
  70,20,Anxious and angry when evil touches him
  70,21,And miserly when good reaches him—
  70,22,Not so (are) those devoted to prayer—
  70,23,Those who remain steadfast to their prayer
  70,24,"And those in whose wealth, is a recognized right (of Allah)"
  70,25,For the (needy) who ask and him who is prevented (for some reason from asking)
  70,26,And those who hold to the Truth of the Day of Judgment
  70,27,And those who fear the displeasure of their Lord—
  70,28,"Verily, their Lord’s displeasure is the opposite of peace and serenity:—"
  70,29,And those who guard their chastity (and sexuality)
  70,30,"Except from their wives and the (captive) whom their right hand possess— For (them), they are not to be blameworthy"
  70,31,But those who go beyond this are transgressors—
  70,32,And those who respect their trusts and covenants
  70,33,And those who stand firm in their testimonies
  70,34,And those who safeguard (the sacredness) of their worship—
  70,35,Such will be the honored ones in the Gardens (of Joy)
  70,36,"So, what is the matter with the unbelievers that they rush madly before you—"
  70,37,From the right and from the left in crowds
  70,38,Does every man from them wish to enter the Paradise (and the Garden of Joy)
  70,39,"Definitely no! Verily, We have created them out of the (base matter) they know"
