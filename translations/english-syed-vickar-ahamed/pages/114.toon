quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,37,"Their wish will be to come out of the Fire, but they will never come out from there: Their Penalty will be one that continues (on and on)"
  5,38,"And for the thief, male or female, cut off his or her hands: As a repayment or what they committed a punishment from Allah to be seen for their crime: And Allah is Highest in Power (Aziz), All Wise (Hakeem)"
  5,39,"But if the thief repents after his crime, and changes his attitude by doing righteous deeds, Allah turns to him in forgiveness; Because Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  5,40,"Do you not know that to Allah (Alone) belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth? He punishes whom He pleases, and He forgives whom He pleases: And Allah is Able (Khadir) over all things"
  5,41,"O Messenger (Muhammad)! Do not let those (people) make you sad, (those) who go faster than the others towards disbelief: (Whether it be) among those who say, \"We believe\", with their lips but whose hearts have no faith; Or it be among the Jews— Men who will listen to any lie— (Men who) will listen even to others who have never even come to you. They change words from their right times and (from their right) places: They say, \"If you are given this, take it, but if not, be aware!\" If anyone's trial is intended by Allah, you (O Prophet!) have no authority in the least over him to protect from Allah. For such (people) — It is not Allah’s Will to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and a severe punishment in the Hereafter"
