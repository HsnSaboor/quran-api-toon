  74,18,"Verily, he thought and he plotted—"
  74,19,"So, let him be the cursed (one)! How he plotted"
  74,20,And again let him be the cursed (one)! How he plotted
  74,21,Then he thought (a little)
  74,22,Then he and frowned (in anger) and glowered (with rage)
  74,23,Then he turned back and was haughty
  74,24,"Then he said: \"This is nothing but magic taken from the old"
  74,25,This is nothing but the word of a (mere) human being
  74,26,Soon will I throw him into the Fire of Hell
  74,27,And what will explain to you what is the Fire of Hell
  74,28,"Neither will it permit to tolerate, nor does it leave alone"
  74,29,Darkening and changing (and burning away) the color of man
  74,30,Over it are nineteen (angels as the keepers)
  74,31,"And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Fire: And We have fixed their number (at 19 and it is so written in other Books) confirming it only as a trial for unbelievers— So that the People of the Book (Scripture) may become certain, and the believers may become convinced of their Faith— And that no doubts may be left for the People(s) of the Book (Scripture), and the believers; And that those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy) and the unbelievers may say, \"What does Allah mean by this (symbol of 19 angels)?\" Thus does Allah leave to wander those whom He pleases, and guide those whom He pleases. And none can know the forces of your Lord, except He. And this is no other than a warning to mankind"
  74,32,"No, surely, by the moon"
  74,33,"And by the night, as it leaves"
  74,34,"And by the morning, as it shines forward—"
  74,35,"Verily, this is but one of the mighty (events unfortunate to the disbelievers)"
  74,36,A warning to mankind—
  74,37,"To any one of you who chooses to move forward, or to those that fall behind—"
  74,38,Every soul will be (held) to account for its deeds
  74,39,Except the companions of the right hand
  74,40,"(They will be) in Gardens (of happiness): They will question each other"
  74,41,And (ask) of the sinners
  74,42,What led you into the Fire of Hell
  74,43,"They will say: \"We were not from those who prayed"
  74,44,Nor were we from those who fed the poor
  74,45,And we used to speak idle-talk with those who spoke against Truth
  74,46,And we used to reject the Day of Judgment
  74,47,Until there came upon us (the Hour) that is certain
