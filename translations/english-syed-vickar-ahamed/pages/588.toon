  83,10,"Misery, on that Day, to those who deny—"
  83,11,Those who do not accept the Day of Judgment
  83,12,"And none can deny it except the transgressor beyond limits, the sinner"
  83,13,"When Our Signs are read (and repeated) to him, he says, \"Tales of old"
  83,14,"By no means! But on their hearts is the stain of (the evil,) whatever they do"
  83,15,"Surely, from the Light (of) their Lord, on that Day will they be blocked"
  83,16,"Further, they will enter the Fire of Hell"
  83,17,"Further, it will be said to them: This is the (reality), which you rejected as false"
  83,18,But no! Surely the record of the righteous is (saved) in register (‘Illiyyun) of the Supreme
  83,19,And What will explain to you what the register (‘Illiyyun) of the Supreme is
  83,20,There is a register (fully) written
  83,21,To which bear witness those nearest (to Allah)
  83,22,Truly the righteous will be in happiness
  83,23,On Thrones (of dignity) they will be able to see a view (of all things)
  83,24,You will recognize in their faces the beaming brightness of joy
  83,25,Their thirst will be quenched with pure wine sealed
  83,26,"The seal will be musk: And for this let them desire, those who have true desires"
  83,27,"With it will be (given) a mixture of drink from the Paradise (Tasnim, the nectar from the pure heavenly fountain)"

  83,30,"And whenever they passed by them, used to wink at each other (in mockery)"
  83,31,"And when they returned to their own people, they would return mocking"
  83,32,"And whenever they saw them (those who believed), they would say, \"Look! These are the people truly astray"
  83,33,But they (the unbelievers) had not been sent as keepers over them (those who believed)
  83,34,But on this Day the believers will laugh at the unbelievers
