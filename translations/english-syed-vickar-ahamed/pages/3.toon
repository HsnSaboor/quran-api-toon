quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  2,6,"As to those (people) who reject Faith, it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them; They will not believe"
  2,7,"Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a veil; Great is the penalty they (have to face)"
  2,8,"And of the people there are some who say: \"We believe in Allah and the Last Day;\" But they do not (really) believe"
  2,9,"Surely! They try to deceive Allah and those who believe, but they only deceive themselves, But do not realize"
  2,10,"In their hearts is a disease and Allah has increased their disease: And painful is the penalty they (will face), because they are false to themselves"
  2,11,"When it is said to them: \"Do not make mischief on the earth,\" they say: \"Why, we only want to make peace"
  2,12,"Surely, they are the ones who make mischief, but they do not realize it"
  2,13,"When it is said to them: \"Believe as the (other) men believe:\" They say: \"Shall we believe as the fools have believed?\" On the contrary, they are the fools, but they do not know"
  2,14,"When they meet those who believe, they say: \"We believe;\" But when they are alone with their evil companions, they say: \"We are really with you; We (were) only mocking"
  2,15,"Allah will throw back their mockery at them, and give them rope in their trespasses; So they will wander like blind ones (back and forth)"
  2,16,"These are they who have exchanged guidance for error: But their trade is profitless, and they have lost true (right) direction"
