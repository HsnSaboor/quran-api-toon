quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,128,"And if a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husband's part, there is no blame on both of them if they arrange all agreeable settlement between themselves; And such settlement is best; even though men's souls are swayed by greed. But if you do good and practice self-restraint, Allah is Well Acquainted with all that you do"
  4,129,"You are never able to be (totally) fair and just between women, even if it is your true (and sincere) wish: So do not turn away (from a woman) altogether, so as to leave her hanging (without support). If you come to a friendly understanding, and practice self-restraint, then Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  4,130,"But if they disagree (and must part by divorce), Allah will provide abundance for all from His all-reaching bounty: And Allah is sufficient for all (Wasi’), All Wise (Hakeem)"
  4,131,"And to Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth. And surely, We have directed the People of the Book before you, and you (O Muslims!) to fear Allah. But if you deny Him, (then) listen! To Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth, and Allah is Free of all wants (Ghani), worthy of all Praise (Hameed)"
  4,132,"Yes, to Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth, and Allah is Enough to complete all affairs (Wakil)"
  4,133,"If He (so) wills, He could destroy you, O Mankind, and create another race; And Allah has the Power to do this"
  4,134,"If anyone desires a reward in this life, then with Allah is the reward of this life and of the Hereafter: And Allah is All Hearing (Sami’), All Seeing (Baseer)"
