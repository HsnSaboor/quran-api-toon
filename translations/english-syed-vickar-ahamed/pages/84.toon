  4,36,"Serve Allah, and do not join any partners with Him; And do good— To parents, (relatives) kinfolk, orphans, those in need, neighbors who are near to you in kin, neighbors who are strangers, the companion by your side, the way-farer (you meet), and what your right hand possess: For Allah does not love the arrogant, the boasters—"
