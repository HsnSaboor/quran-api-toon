quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  42,23,"That is (the reward) about which Allah gives glad tidings (and good news) to His servants who believe and do righteous good deeds. Say: \"No reward do I ask of you for this except to be kind to me in the love and kinship.\" And if anyone earns any good and righteous deeds, We shall give him an increase in the good (that he has earned in proper measure): Verily, Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Appreciative (Ash-Shukoor, of the service from His servants)"
  42,24,"Or, do they say: \"He has made up lies against Allah?\" If Allah so willed, He could close up your heart. And Allah removes (false) pride, and proves the Truth by His Words. Verily, He knows well the secrets in all human breasts (hearts)"
  42,25,"And He is the One Who accepts repentance (At-Tawwab) from His servants, and forgives sins, and He knows all that you do"
  42,26,"And He hears those who believe and act righteously, and gives them increase of His Bounty: And as for the unbelievers there is a terrible penalty"
  42,27,"If Allah increases what is given to His servants, they would indeed rebel and cross all bounds in the earth; But He sends (it) down in right measure as He pleases. Verily, He is All Aware (Khabir) of His servants, All Seer (Baseer, of what they do)"
  42,28,"And He is the One Who sends down the rain (even) after (men) have despaired and given up any hope, and scatters His Mercy (far and wide). And He is the protector (Wali), Worthy of all Praise (Hameed)"
  42,29,"And among His Signs is the Creation of the heavens and the earth, and the living creatures that He has spread in them: And He can gather them together when He wills"
  42,30,"And whatever misfortune comes to you, it is because of the things your hands have done, and for many (of them) He pardons generously"
  42,31,And you cannot hinder (anything even a little bit while you are passing) through the earth; And you have none besides Allah— (Not) anyone to protect or to help
