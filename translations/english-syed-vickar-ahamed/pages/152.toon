quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  7,12,"(Allah) said: \"What prevented you (O Satan) from bowing down when I Commanded you?\" He (Satan) said: \"I am better than he (Adam): You created me from Fire, and him (Adam) from clay"
  7,13,"(Allah) said: \"Get yourself down of it (Paradise): It is not for you to be arrogant here: Get out because you are of the disgraced and shameful"
  7,14,"He (Satan) said: \"Give me respite (rest) till the Day (of Resurrection when) they are raised up"
  7,15,"(Allah) said: \"You be among those who have a rest"
  7,16,"He (Satan) said: \"Because you have thrown me out of the Way: Look! I will lie in wait against them on Your Straight Path"
  7,17,"Then I will attack them, from before them and behind them, from their right and their left: And You will not find most of them to be thankful (for Your Mercies)"
  7,18,"(Allah) said: \"Get out from it, disgraced and expelled. If any of them follow you— Then, surely, I will fill the Hell with all of you"
  7,19,"And, O Adam! You and your wife live in the Paradise, and enjoy (the good things) as you like (them): But do not go near this tree, or you will be unjust and wrongdoers (in sin)"
  7,20,"Then Satan began to whisper doubts to both them, bringing openly to their minds all their shame that was hidden from them: He said: \"Your Lord asked you not to come near this tree, lest you should become angels or such beings as (those who) live forever"
  7,21,"And he (Satan) swore to both of them: \"I am one of the sincere well wishers to both of you"
  7,22,"So by lying (and deception) he brought about their Fall: When they tasted (the fruit) from the tree, their shame became clear to them, and they began to sew together the leaves of the Garden over their bodies. And their Lord called to them: \"Did I not ask you to keep away from that tree, and tell you that Satan (Shaitan) was an avowed enemy to you"
