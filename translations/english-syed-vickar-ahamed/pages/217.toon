quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,71,"And recite to them the story of Nuh (Noah). When he said to his people: \"O my people! If it is difficult for your (minds) that I should stay (with you) and tell (you) the Signs of Allah— Still I put my trust in Allah, then you get an agreement about your plan and among your 'partners', so that your plan for you is not dark and dubious. Then pass your judgment about me, and give me no (special) consideration or relief"
  10,72,"But if you can not do this, (then remember): I have asked no reward from you: My reward is to come only from Allah, and I have been ordered to be from those (people) who bow (down) to Allah’s Will (in Islam)"
  10,73,"They rejected him, but We saved him, and those with him in the Ark, and We made them take over (the earth), generation replacing one after another while We overpowered in the Flood those who rejected Our Signs (verses). Then, see what was the end of those who were warned. (But did not pay attention)"
  10,74,"Then after him, We sent messengers to their people: They (messengers) brought them clear proofs (of Allah), but they would not believe what they had already rejected before. Like this, We do close the hearts of those who transgress their limits"
  10,75,"Then after them We sent Musa (Moses) and Haroon (Aaron) to Firon (Pharaoh) and his chiefs with Our Signs (verses), but they were proud: They were people in sin (and crime)"
  10,76,"So when the Truth did come to them from Us, they said: \"This is really clear magic"
  10,77,"Musa (Moses) said: \"Do you say (this) about Truth when it has (actually) come to you? Is this (like) magic? But magicians will not prosper"
  10,78,"They said: \"Have you come to us to turn us away from the way (that) we found our fathers following— So that you two, (Musa) and your brother (Haroon) may have fame in the land? But we shall not believe in you"
