quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  58,12,"O you who believe! When you speak with the Messenger in private, spend something in charity before the consultation. That will be best for you, and most helpful towards purity (of conduct). But if you do not find, (the means to spend in charity), then verily, Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  58,13,"Is it that you are afraid of spending sums in charity before your private consultation (with the Prophet)? If (that is the case), then, you do not do so, and Allah forgives you, but, establish regular prayer; Practice regular charity; And obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah is Well-Acquainted (Khabir) with all that you do"
  58,14,"Do you not turn your attention to those who seek (friendship) of such (people) that have the anger of Allah upon them? They are neither of you nor of them, and they swear to falsehood knowingly"
  58,15,"Allah has prepared for them a severe Penalty: Evil indeed are their deeds"
  58,16,"They have made their oaths a screen (to hide their misdeeds): Thus they obstruct (men) from the Path of Allah. Therefore they shall have a shameful penalty"
  58,17,"Their wealth and their sons will not be of any profit to them, against Allah; They will be companions of the Fire, to live in there (for ever)"
  58,18,"On the Day, when Allah will raise all of them up (for Judgment): Then they will swear to Him as they swear to you: And they think that they have something (to stand upon). No indeed! They are liars"
  58,19,"The Satan has taken the better of them. So he has made them forget the remembrance of Allah. They are the party of the Satan. Truly, it is the party of the Satan that will perish"
  58,20,"Verily, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger they will be among those most humiliated"
  58,21,"Allah has affirmed (and decreed): \"Verily, it is I and My messengers who must win (prevail):\" Verily, Allah is One full of Strength, Almighty (Able to make His Will become reality)"
