quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,106,"None of Our revelations do We change or cause to be forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar; Do you not know that Allah has power over all things"
  2,107,"Do you (also) not know that to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth? And except Him, you have neither a friend nor a helper"
  2,108,"Or would you question your Prophet (Muhammad) as Musa (Moses) was questioned in the old (days)? And whoever changes from Faith to disbelief, indeed, has strayed without doubt from the right way"
  2,109,"Many from the People of the Book wish they could turn you (believers) back to disbelief after you have believed, From selfish envy, (even) after the Truth has become clear to them: But forgive and overlook till Allah completes His purpose; Indeed, Allah has power over all things"
  2,110,"And be regular in prayer, and regular in charity: And whatever good you send forth for your souls before you (from this life), you shall find it with Allah: Surely, Allah sees well all that you do"
  2,111,"And they say: \"None shall enter Paradise unless he is a Jew or a Christian.\" Those are (only) their vain or empty wishes. Say to them: \"Bring your proof if you are truthful"
  2,112,"But no! Whoever submits his whole self to Allah and does good— He will get his reward with his Lord: For such people, there shall be no fear and they shall not be in pain"
