quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,109,"To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth: To Him do all matters go back (for the final decision)"
  3,110,"You are the best of Peoples ever, evolved from (Mankind and) for Mankind enjoining what is right, preventing what is wrong, and believing in Allah; And if only the People of the Book had faith, it would be best for them: Among them are some who have faith, but most of them are those who exceed the bound with evil in their minds"
  3,111,"They will not do you any serious harm, but a little trouble; If they come out to fight you, they will turn back, and they shall not get any help"
  3,112,"Shame is thrown over them (like a tent) wherever they are found, except when (they are) under a promise (of protection) from Allah and from men; They draw on themselves anger from Allah and upon them is thrown severe poverty. This is because they rejected the Signs (verses) of Allah, and killed the prophets without right; And because they rebelled and crossed the bounds"
  3,113,"Not all of them are alike: From the People of the Book are a portion that stand up (for right); They read (and declare) the Signs (verses) of Allah all night long, and they prostrate themselves in devotion (to Allah)"
  3,114,"They believe in Allah and the Last Day; They join in what is right, and forbid what is wrong: And they hasten (to carry on all the) good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous"
  3,115,"From the good that they do, nothing will be rejected from them; For Allah knows well those that do right (and act righteously)"
