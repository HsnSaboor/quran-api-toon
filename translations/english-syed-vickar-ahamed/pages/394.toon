  28,72,"Say: \"Tell me! If Allah was to make the day last for ever for you till the Day of Judgment, which god is there other than Allah, can give you a night in which you can rest? Then will you not see"
  28,73,"And it is from His Mercy that He has made for you night and day— That you may rest in it (the night), and that you may seek His Grace (in the day)— And so that you may be thankful"
  28,74,"And the Day that when He will call to them, and He will say: \"Where are My (so called) 'partners'? Whom you thought (to be of those)"
  28,75,"And from each people, We will draw a witness, and We shall say: \"Produce your proof:\" Then shall they know that the Truth is with Allah (Alone), and the (lies) that they had invented will leave them in the bad situation"

  28,77,"But search out, with the (wealth) that Allah has given to you, the Home of the Hereafter, and do not forget your lawful (and good) fortune in this world: But you do good, like Allah has been good to you, and do not search (to make) mischief in the land: Verily, Allah loves not those who do mischief"
