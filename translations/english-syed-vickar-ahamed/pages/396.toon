quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  28,85,"Surely (O Prophet!) He, Who ordained the Quran for you, will bring you back to the Place of Return (signifies both Makkah and the Hereafter). Say: \"My Lord knows best who brings true guidance, and who is openly in the wrong"
  28,86,"And you had not expected that the Book would be sent down to you, except as a Mercy from your Lord: Therefore you do not give any support to those who reject (Allah’s Message)"
  28,87,"And let nothing keep you away from the Signs of Allah (verses) after they have been made known to you: And invite (men) to your Lord, and do not be in the company of those who join gods with Allah"
  28,88,"And call not, besides Allah, to another god. There is no god but He: Everything (that lives) shall die except His Own Face. To Him belongs the Command, and to Him will (all of) you be brought back"
  29,1,Alif Lam Mim
  29,2,"Does mankind think that by (just) saying, \"We believe,\" they will be left alone and that they will not be tested"
  29,3,"And We indeed, did test those who were before them, so that Allah will indeed know, those who are true and He will know those who are liars"
  29,4,Or do those who act evil think that they will gain over Us (Allah)? Evil is their judgment (if they think so)
  29,5,"Whosoever hope (and wish) for meeting with Allah (let them work hard); Because the Time (fixed) by Allah is surely coming: And He is the All Hearing (As-Sami’), All Knowing (Al-Aleem)"
  29,6,"And whosoever strive a(with will and strength), they do so for their own souls: For Allah is Free (Ghani) of all needs from all Creation"
