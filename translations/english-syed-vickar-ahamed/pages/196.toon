quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,55,"So let not their wealth, nor their sons amaze you: In reality, Allah’s Plan is to punish them with these things in this life, and that their souls may die as disbelievers"
  9,56,"They swear by Allah that they are truly of you; While (in reality) they are not of you: But they are people (hypocrites) afraid (that you may kill them)"
  9,57,"If they could find a place of refuge, or caves, or a place of hiding, they would run there at once, in great hurry"
  9,58,"And among them are men who speak ill of you in the matter of (the distribution of) charity: If they are given part of it, then they are happy, but if not, look! They are angry (and indignant)"
  9,59,"If only they had been pleased with what Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad) gave them, and had said, \"Allah is sufficient for us! Allah will give us from His bounty, and His Messenger (from the charity): To Allah do we turn our hopes!\" (That would have been right)"
  9,60,"Alms (goods and money given in charity) are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to manage the (funds); For those whose hearts have turned (to truth and belief recently); For those in slavery (and for the freedom of captives) and in debt; And for (fighters in) the cause of Allah; And for the wayfarer: (It is so) ordered by Allah, and Allah is All Knowing (Aleem), All Wise (Hakeem)"
  9,61,"Among them are men who annoy (and bother) the Prophet and say, \"He is all ears (listens to everyone).\" Say, \"He listens to what is best for you: He believes in Allah, has faith in the believers, and is a Mercy to those of you who believe.\" But those who annoy the Messenger will have a painful punishment"
