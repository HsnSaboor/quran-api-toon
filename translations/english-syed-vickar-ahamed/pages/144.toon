quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,125,"Those to whom Allah (in His Plan) wills to guide— He opens his breast (heart) to Islam; Those whom He wills to leave wandering— He makes his breast (heart) narrow and tight, as if he had to climb up to the sky (through his own heart): Thus does Allah (place) the penalty on those who refuse to believe"
  6,126,"And, this is the Way of your Lord, leading (you) Straight: We have explained the Signs for those who receive the warning"
  6,127,"For them will be a Home of Peace in the Presence of their Lord: He will be their (close) Protector (Wali), because they practiced (righteousness)"
  6,128,"And on the Day, when He will gather all of them, (the jinns',) together (and say): \"O you assembly of jinns'! Many of you did mislead from the men.\" Their friends among men will say: \"Our Lord! We profited from each other: But, we have reached (the end of) our term— Which You did appoint for us.\" He will say: \"The Fire will be your dwelling place: You will live in there for ever, except as Allah wills. For your Lord is All Wise (Hakeem), All Knowing (Aleem)"
  6,129,"And thus, We make the wrongdoers turn to each other, because of what they have earned"
  6,130,"O you assembly of jinns' and men! Did the messengers not come to you from among you, telling you of My Signs and warning you of the facing of this Day?\" They will say: \"We bear witness against ourselves.\" It was the present life that deceived them. And they will bear witness against themselves that they rejected Faith (as disbelievers)"
  6,131,"(The messengers were sent), because your Lord would not destroy the townships of men for their wrong-doing while the people (of the townships) were not warned"
