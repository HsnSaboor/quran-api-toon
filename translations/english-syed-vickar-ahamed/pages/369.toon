  26,40,"That we may follow (the religion of) the magicians, if they win?”"
  26,41,"So, when the magicians arrived, they said to Firon (Pharaoh): \"Truly— Shall we have a (worthy) reward if we win"
  26,42,"Said (Firon): \"Yes, (and more)— Because, in that case (if you win), you will be (given positions) near (to me)"
  26,43,"Said Musa (Moses) to them: \"You throw— Whatever you are about to throw"
  26,44,"So, they threw their ropes and their rods, and said: \"By the might of Firon (Pharaoh), it is we who will really win"
  26,45,"Then (Musa) threw his rod, when, look! It right away swallows up all the lies that they make up"
  26,46,"Then the magicians fell down, prostrate in praise"
  26,47,"Saying: \"We believe in the Lord of the Worlds (Rab-ul-'Ala'meen)"
  26,48,The Lord of Musa (Moses) and Haroon (Aaron)
  26,49,"Said (Firon): \"Will you believe in Him (Allah) before I give you permission? Surely, he (Musa) is your chief, who has taught you magic! But you will know soon! Be sure I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will cause you all to die on the cross"
  26,50,"They said: \"(That) does not matter! About us, we shall only go back to our Lord"
  26,51,"Verily, our desire is that our Lord will forgive us for our mistakes, that we may become first among the believers"

  26,53,Then Firon (Pharaoh) sent news to (all) the Cities
  26,54,These (people) are only a small group
  26,55,And they are very angry against us
  26,56,But we are a many more with enough warning
