quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"Who used to say: 'What! Are you from those (people) who confirms the Truth (of the Message)"
  37,53,"That when we die and become dust and bones, shall we really receive the rewards and punishments"
  37,54,"(The speaker) said: \"Would you like to look down"
  37,55,So he looked down and saw him (the questioner) in the middle of the Fire
  37,56,"He (the speaker) said: \"By Allah! You brought me very close to ruin (in this Hell)"
  37,57,"Had it not been for the Grace of my Lord, I would surely be among those brought (to Hell)"
  37,58,"(The people of Paradise will say:) \"Is it (true) that we will not die (again)"
  37,59,"Except our first death, and that we shall not be punished"
  37,60,"Surely, this is the supreme success (to be in the Paradise of joy)"
  37,61,"For those who like (the state) this (joy) let (them) all work hard, (those) who wish to strive"
  37,62,"Is that (the Paradise), the better place (of joy) or the (evil and wicked) tree of Zaqqum (in the Pit of Hell, see 37.64—)"
  37,63,"Truly, We have made it (the evil tree of Zaqqum) a trial for the wrongdoers"
  37,64,"Verily, it is a tree that comes out from the bottom of Hell-Fire"
  37,65,"The buds of its fruit-stalk, come out of the stems; (They are) like the heads of Satans"
  37,66,"Truly, they (the wrongdoers) will eat from there and fill their stomachs with it"
  37,67,Then on top of that they will be given a mixture made of boiling water
  37,68,"Then, thereafter, verily their return will be to the burning Fire of Hell"
  37,69,"Truly, they found their fathers on the wrong path"
  37,70,So they (also) were rushed down after them (in their fathers evil footsteps)
  37,71,"And indeed, before them, many (people) from the olden days went astray—"
  37,72,"And indeed, We sent (messengers) among them, to warn them—"
  37,73,Then see what was the end of those who were warned (but did not pay attention)—
  37,74,Except the devoted (and loving) servants of Allah
  37,75,"And indeed, (in the old days), Nuh (Noah) cried to Us, and We are the best of those to answer him"
  37,76,"And We rescued him, and his family from the great destruction (of the Flood)"
