  11,31,"And, I do not tell you that the treasures of Allah are with me, nor do I know what is hidden, nor do I claim to be an angel, nor do I say, that of those whom you look down in contempt that Allah will not grant them what is good: Allah knows best what is in their souls: I should, if I did (drive them away), truly be a wrong-doer"
