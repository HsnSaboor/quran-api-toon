quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,The people of Lut (Lot) rejected the messengers
  26,161,"When their brother Lut (Lot) said to them: \"Will you not fear (Allah)"
  26,162,"Verily, I am to you a messenger fit for all trust"
  26,163,"So, fear Allah and obey me"
  26,164,"I do not ask for any reward for it from you: My reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds (Rab-ul-'Ala'meen)"
  26,165,"Will you run after males, of all creation (made) in the worlds"
  26,166,And leave those (the females) whom Allah has made for you to be your wives? No! You are a people exceeding (all moral limits)
  26,167,"They said: \"O Lut (Lot)! If you do not stop, you will surely be one of those driven out"
  26,168,"He said: \"I am one of those who disapproves your acts (of sodomy) with severe hate and anger"
  26,169,O my Lord! Save me and my family from such things like what they do
  26,170,"So, We saved him and his family— All"
  26,171,Except an old woman who kept behind
  26,172,But the rest We destroyed totally
  26,173,"And, We rained down on them a shower (of hard clay-stone): And evil was the shower on those who were warned (but did not listen)"
  26,174,Surely there is a Sign in this but most of them do not believe
  26,175,"And surely your Lord is He (Who is) the Almighty (Al-Aziz), the Most Merciful (Ar-Raheem)"
  26,176,The companions of the Wood rejected the messengers
  26,177,"When Shu’aib said to them: \"Will you not fear (Allah)"

  26,179,So fear Allah and obey me
  26,180,"I do not ask for any reward for it from you: My reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds (Rab-ul-'Ala'meen)"
  26,181,Give proper measure (to others) and do not make loss (for others by cheating)
  26,182,And weigh with true and upright scales
  26,183,"And do not defraud (hold back) things that are truly due to men, and do no evil in the land, by making mischief"
