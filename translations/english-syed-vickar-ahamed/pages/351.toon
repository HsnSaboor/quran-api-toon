quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,11,"Verily, those who brought out the slander (lie) are a group from yourselves: Do not think (of the incident) to be an evil for you; No! It is good for you: For every man from them (is the punishment) of the sin that he has earned, and for him who took on himself the lead from them, the penalty (for him) will be great"
  24,12,"Why then, did not the believers —men and women — When you heard of the incident— Put the best reasons after it in their own minds and say, \"This (slander) is an open lie"
  24,13,"Why did they (the accusers) not bring four witnesses to prove it (the blame)? When they have not brought the witnesses: In the Sight of Allah, such men (hold) themselves as liars"
  24,14,"If it was not because of the grace and mercy of Allah on you, in this world and the Hereafter, a painful penalty would have caught you because you so easily spoke about this affair"
  24,15,"When you move it forward with your tongues, and said from your mouths things of which you had no knowledge; And you thought it to be a light matter, when it was most serious in the Sight of Allah"
  24,16,"And why did you not, when you heard it, say— \"It is not right of us to speak of this: Glory to Allah! This is a most serious lie (against any person)"
  24,17,"Allah does warn and forbids you, that you may never repeat such (actions), if you are true believers"
  24,18,"And Allah makes the Signs plain (and clear) to you: And Allah is All Knowing, (Aleem), All Wise (Hakeem)"
  24,19,"Verily, those who love (to see) lies circulated openly among the believers, they will have a painful penalty in this life and in the hereafter: And Allah knows, and you do not know"
  24,20,"If it was not because of Allah’s grace and mercy upon you, and that Allah is full of kindness (Ra'uf), Most Merciful (Raheem); (You would be truly lost)"
