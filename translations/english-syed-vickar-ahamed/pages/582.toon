quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,Concerning what are they asking
  78,2,Concerning the great news
  78,3,About which they cannot agree
  78,4,"Surely, they shall soon know"
  78,5,"Surely, (but) surely, they shall soon know"
  78,6,Have We not made the earth as a wide expanse (as a bed)
  78,7,And the mountains as pegs
  78,8,And (have We not) created you in pairs
  78,9,And made your sleep for rest
  78,10,And made the night as an umbrella of peace
  78,11,And made the day for finding livelihood
  78,12,And (have We not) built over you the seven strong arches of the heavens
  78,13,And placed (in there) a Light of brilliance
  78,14,"And do We not send down from the clouds water, in plenty"
  78,15,"That We may produce with it, corn and vegetables"
  78,16,And gardens of rich growth
  78,17,"Surely, the Day of Judgment is an event appointed—"
  78,18,The Day that the Trumpet shall be sounded and you shall come forward in crowds
  78,19,And the heavens shall be opened as if there were doors
  78,20,"And the mountains shall vanish, as if they were a mirage"
  78,21,"Truly, Hell is like a place of ambush—"
  78,22,For those who fought (against Faith); (Their) place of eternal stay
  78,23,They will live in there for ages
  78,24,"Nothing cool shall they taste there, nor any drink"
  78,25,"Save a boiling fluid and a fluid, dark, grim, bitterly cold—"
  78,26,A fitting return (for their actions and for them)
  78,27,"Because, they did not fear any accounting (of their deeds)"
  78,28,But they (grimly) treated Our Signs as false
  78,29,"And all things, We have preserved on record"
  78,30,"So taste you (the reward), because We shall not grant you any increase except in (your) punishment"
