quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,It will not help them that they enjoyed (this life)
  26,208,And We never ruined a population that did not have its warners—
  26,209,As a reminder (to mankind); And We never are unjust
  26,210,And no Satans' (or the Evil ones) have brought down this (Message)
  26,211,"It would not befit them, and they would not be able (to produce it)"
  26,212,"As a fact, they have been removed far away from even hearing it"
  26,213,"So do not call on any other god with Allah, or you will be from those under the penalty"
  26,214,And advise and warn your nearest relatives
  26,215,And lower you arms (as greetings) to the believers who follow you
  26,216,"Even then, if they disobey you, say: I am free (of responsibility) for what you do"
  26,217,"And place your trust on the Almighty (Al-Aziz), the Most Merciful (Ar-Raheem)"
  26,218,Who sees you standing up (in prayer)
  26,219,And (sees) your movements among those who prostrate themselves
  26,220,"Verily, it is He Who hears and knows all things"
  26,221,"(O my people!) Shall I inform you, on whom it is that Satans' (or the Evil ones) come down"
  26,222,"They come down on every lying, sinful person"
  26,223,"(In their ears) they fill half-true, worthless things, and most of them are liars"
  26,224,As for the poets— Those astray (in evil) who follow them
  26,225,Do you not see that they (anxiously) speak about every subject (of lies and sin) in their poetry
  26,226,And that they say what they do not do
  26,227,"Except those who believe and work rightfully, and do much in the remembering of Allah, and (act to) defend themselves only after they are wrongly attacked. And soon will the unjust attackers know what sudden changes their actions will take"
