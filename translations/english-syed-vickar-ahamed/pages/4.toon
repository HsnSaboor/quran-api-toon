quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"Their similitude is that of a man who started a fire; When it shed light all around him Allah took away their light and left them in total darkness, so they could not see"
  2,18,"They are deaf, dumb, and blind, so they will not return (to the right path)"
  2,19,"Or (another similitude) is that of a stormy rain cloud from the sky: In it are zones of darkness, and thunder and lightning. They press their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunder, the while they are in terror of death. But Allah is all around those who reject Faith"
  2,20,"The lightning almost snatches away their sight, every time the light (helps) them, they walk in there, and when the darkness covers them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could take away their hearing and their sight; Because Allah has power (Khadir) over all things"
  2,21,"O you people! Worship (and pray to) your Guardian—Lord, Who created you, and those who came before you, that you might have the chance to learn righteousness"
  2,22,"Who has made the earth a place of rest for you, and the sky your canopy; And sent down rain from the sky; And brought forth from there fruits for your sustenance; Then do not set up rivals to Allah when you know (the truth)"
  2,23,"And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed (from time to time) to Our servant (the Prophet), then produce a Sura like the one here (in the Quran); And call your witness (or helpers if there are any) besides Allah, if you are truthful"
  2,24,But if you cannot— And surely you cannot— Then fear the Fire whose fuel is Men and Stones— Which is prepared for those who reject Faith
