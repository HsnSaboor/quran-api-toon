quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,78,"And surely, there is among them a section who change the Book with their tongues (as they read): You would think it is a part of the Book, but it is not a part of the Book; And they say: \"That is from Allah\", but it is not from Allah: It is they who tell a lie against Allah, and they know it well"
  3,79,"It is not (possible) that a man, to whom is given the Book, and Wisdom, and the position of a prophet, can say to people; \"Be you my worshippers rather than Allah’s:\" On the contrary (he would say): \"Be you the worshippers of Him, Who is truly the Cherisher of all: For you have been taught the Book and you have studied it truthfully"
  3,80,"Nor, he would not instruct you to take angels and prophets for lords and patrons. What! Would he invite you to disbelief after you have surrendered your will (to Allah in Islam)"
  3,81,"And (remember), Allah took the (holy) promise from the prophets, saying: \"I give you a Book and Wisdom; Then comes to you a Prophet (Muhammad), confirming what is with you; Do you believe in him and render him help.\" Allah said: \"Do you agree, and take this My Promise as binding on you?\" They said: \"We agree.\" He said: \"Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses"
  3,82,"If any turn away after this, they are perverted transgressors"
  3,83,"Do they search (for a religion) other than the Religion of Allah? When all creatures in the heavens and on earth have willingly and unwillingly, surrendered to Him (and accepted Islam), and to Him shall they all be brought back"
