quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,59,"And nothing could stop Us from sending the Signs, except that the men of earlier generations denied them as false: And We sent the she-camel to the Samood (Thamud) to open their eyes (to the truth), but they treated her wrongfully: And We only send the Signs to bring fear in (them and to keep them away from evil)"
  17,60,"And (remember) when We told you that your Lord surrounds mankind around: And We gave the Vision which We showed you, only as a trial for men— As also the cursed tree in the Quran: (Mentioned as tree of Zaqqum in verses 37.62—65; 44.43—46; And 55.52.) We put fear (and warning) into them, but it only increases their excessive evil in nothing but their vast disbelief, injustices and disobedience"
  17,61,"And (remember) when We said to the angels: \"Bow down (prostrate yourselves) to Adam\": They bowed down except Satan: He said, \"Shall I bow down to one (Adam) whom You created (only) from clay"
  17,62,"He (Satan) said, \"Do You see? This is one whom you have honored above me! If You will only grant me relief till the Day of Judgment, I will surely take his (Adam's) children under my control— And mislead them— All, except a few"
  17,63,"(Allah) said: \"Go your way; If any of them follow you, surely! Hell will be the repayment for you (all)— And enough (it is) for a repayment"
  17,64,"Lead to destruction those whom you can among them, gradually, with your seductive voice (of evil); Make attacks on them with your horsemen and soldiers; Together with them share wealth and children; And make (false) promises to them.\" But Satan promises them nothing but lies"
  17,65,"Verily! About My (loyal and true) servants, you will not have authority over them:\" And your Lord is All Sufficient as a Guardian of affairs (Wakil)"
  17,66,"Your Lord is He Who makes the ship go smoothly for you through the sea, so that you may seek from His Bounty. Truly, He is Most Merciful (Raheem) to you"
