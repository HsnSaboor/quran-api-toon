quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  33,1,"O Prophet! Fear Allah and do not obey the unbelievers and the hypocrites (those who hide the truth). Surely, Allah is All Knower (Aleem), All Wise (Hakeem)"
  33,2,"And follow the (guidance) which comes unto you from your Lord by (inner) Revelation: Verily, Allah knows (Khabir) well everything that you do"
  33,3,"And put your trust in Allah, and Allah is enough to be a Disposer of affairs (Wakil)"
  33,4,"Allah has not made for any man, two hearts in his (one) body: Nor, (O people!) has He (Allah) made your wives, whom you declare to be like your mother’s backs (and thus divorce them by the evil practice of Az-Zihar, see 58.2—4), your real mothers: Nor has He made your adopted sons your (real) sons. This is (only) your (manner of) speaking by your mouths. But Allah reveals (to you) the Truth, and He shows the (right) Way"
  33,5,"Call them by (the names of) their fathers: That is more correct in the Sight of Allah. But if you do not know their fathers (names, then call them) your brothers in faith, or your freed helpers. And there is no sin on you if you made a mistake. Except unless your hearts willfully intended: And Allah is Often-Returning (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  33,6,"The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are (in a holy sense) their mothers. By the Command of Allah, blood-relations among each other have closer personal ties, than (the brotherhood of) believers and those traveling from distant lands: However, you do what is just to your closest friends: Such is the writing in the Command (Book from Allah)"
