quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,171,"And (remember), when We shook the mount over them, as if it had been a cloud, and they thought it was going to fall on them (We said): \"Hold firmly to what We have given to you, and (always) remember what is in there, so that you fear Allah and obey Him"
  7,172,"And (remember) when your Lord took from the Children of Adam— From their loins— Their descendants, and made them speak out about themselves: \"Am I not your Lord?\" — They said: \"Yes! We testify for sure.\" (This is so), just in case you may say on the Day of Judgment: \"We were never aware of this"
  7,173,"Or in case you may say: \"Our fathers before us may have taken false gods, but we are (their) descendants: Then will You destroy us because of the deeds of men who were useless"
  7,174,Like this We explain the Signs in detail; And so that they may come back (to Us)
  7,175,"Tell them the story of the man to whom We sent Our Signs, but he let them pass: So Satan kept after him, and he went astray"
  7,176,"And if it had been Our Will, We should have raised him with Our Signs; But he was tempted (down) to the earth, and followed his own useless desires. So the similarity is that of a dog: If you attack him, he puts out his tongue (and pants), or if you leave him alone, he (still) hangs out his tongue (and pants). That is the similarity of those who reject Our Signs; So relate the stories; So that they may think"
  7,177,Evil is the example of people who reject Our Signs and (they) used to wrong themselves
  7,178,"And surely, whomsoever Allah guides, he is on the right path; Whom He rejects from His guidance— Such are the persons who perish"
