  35,21,Neither are the (cool) shade and the (burning) heat of the sun

  35,23,You are none except a warner
  35,24,"Surely, We have sent you with the truth, as a bearer of happy news, and as a warner: And there were never any people, without a warner who did not live among them (in the past)"
  35,25,"And if they (the people) deny (and reject) you, so, also did (reject) those before them, to whom came their messengers, with Clear Signs, and with Scripture (books of harsh prophecies), and the Book of Enlightenment"

  35,27,"Do you not see that Allah sends down the rain from the sky? With it We then bring out crops (and farm produce) of various colors. And (there) are streaks (in fruits, rocks and minerals) in the mountains white and red, of many shades of color, and black, deep in (its) coloration"
  35,28,"And also among men and moving (crawling) creatures and cattle, they are (also) of various colors. Among His (Allah’s) Servants, (there are) those who truly fear Allah, are (those) who have knowledge (that) verily, Allah is Almighty (Aziz), Often Forgiving (Ghafoor)"
  35,29,"Verily, those who recite the Book of Allah, and perform regular Prayer, and spend (in charity), from what We have given to them secretly and openly; The Hope for a sure-trade (the reward) will never fail"
