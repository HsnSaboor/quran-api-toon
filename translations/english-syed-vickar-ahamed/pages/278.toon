quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  16,94,"And do not make your promises to (hide the) acts of dishonesty (and deception) between yourselves, with the effect that someone's foot may slip after it was firmly placed, and you may have to taste the evil (penalty) for having blocked (men) from the Path of Allah, and the mighty Anger (of Allah) come upon you"
  16,95,"And do not use the Oath of Allah for a cheap (worldly) gain: For with Allah is (a reward) much better for you, if you only knew"
  16,96,"What is with you will go out of existence: What is with Allah will stay behind (for ever). And We will certainly bless upon those, their reward by the best of their actions, for those who patiently remain constant and committed (towards the right)"
  16,97,"Whosoever works right, (be it) man or woman, and has Faith (in Allah), surely, to him will We give a good Life, a life that is good and pure, and We will bless upon those their reward by the best of their actions"
  16,98,"So when you recite the Quran, ask (and plead) for Allah’s protection against Satan, the outcast and cursed one"
  16,99,"Verily, he (Satan) has no authority on those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord"
  16,100,"His (Satan’s) authority is only over those, who take him as an (evil) guide and follow him and who join (false) ‘partners’ with Allah"
  16,101,"When We replace one verse for another— And Allah knows best what He reveals (in stages)— They (the disbelievers) say, \"You are only a forger:\" But most of them do not understand"
  16,102,"Say: \"The Angel Gabriel has brought the revelation from your Lord in Truth, as to strengthen (all) those who believe and as a guide and as good news to Muslims.”"
