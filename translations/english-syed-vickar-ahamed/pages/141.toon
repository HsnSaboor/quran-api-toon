quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,102,"That is Allah, your Lord! There is no god but He: The Creator of all things: So you worship Him Alone: And He is the Trustee and Disposer (Wakil) of all affairs"
  6,103,"No vision can hold Him but His grasp is over all (the) vision: He is the Subtle (Al-Lateef) beyond any understanding yet He is All Aware (Khabeer) of all things"
  6,104,"Surely, now the proofs have come to you, from your Lord, (to open your eyes): If any (one of you) will see, it will be for (the good of) his own soul; If any (one) will be blind, it will be to his own (harm): I am not (here) to watch over your doings"
  6,105,"Like this We explain the Signs by various (symbols): That they may say: \"You have taught (us) properly\", and so We may make the matter clear for those who know and understand"
  6,106,"You follow what (you) are taught by revelation from your Lord: There is no god but He: And turn away from those who join gods with Allah"
  6,107,"If it was Allah’s Will, they would not have taken false gods: But We did not make you the one to watch over what they do, nor are you set over them to take care of their affairs"
  6,108,"Do not be abusive towards those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest out of anger, they may be abusive towards Allah, in their ignorance. So have We made attractive to each people its own doings. In the end, they will return to their Lord, and We shall then tell them the truth of all that they did"
  6,109,"They make their strongest oaths by Allah, that if a (special) Sign came to them, (then) by it, they would believe. Say: \"(All) Signs are certainly, in the Power of Allah: But what will make you (believers) realize that (even) if (special) Signs came, they will not believe"
  6,110,"We (too) shall give their hearts and their eyes (confusion), because they refused to believe in this (Sign) in the first place: We shall leave them to exceed their limits (and) to wander in (confusion and) distraction"
