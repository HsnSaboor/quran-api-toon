quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,13,"Or they say, \"He has forged it (made it up himself).\" Say: \"Then you bring ten Suras made up, similar to it, and call anyone you can (to help), other than Allah! If you speak the truth"
  11,14,"If then they (your false gods) do not answer your (call for help), you will know that this (Book of) Revelation is sent down with (full) knowledge of Allah, and that there is no god except He! Even then, will you submit (to Islam)"
  11,15,Those who want the life of the world and its (showy) brightness— We shall pay them (for) their deeds in there— And they will have no reduction (in their penalty)
  11,16,"They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire: Useless are the deeds they did there in (the world), and of no effect are the acts that they did"
  11,17,"Can they be (like) those (Muslims) who accept a Clear (Message, the Quran) from their Lord, and whom a witness (Gabriel) from (Allah) Him(self) recites (and follows) it, like the Book of Musa (Moses) before it— A Guide and a Mercy? They believe in it; But those of the Sects that reject it— The Fire will be their promised meeting-place. So do not be in doubt about it: Verily, it is the Truth from your Lord: But many among men do not believe"
  11,18,"And who does more wrong than he who invents (makes up) a lie against Allah? They will be sent back to the Presence of their Lord, and the witnesses will say, \"These are the ones who lied against their Lord! No doubt! The Curse of Allah is on those who do wrong"
  11,19,"Those who would (try to) block (others) from the path of Allah and search for something crooked in it: These were they who denied the Hereafter"
