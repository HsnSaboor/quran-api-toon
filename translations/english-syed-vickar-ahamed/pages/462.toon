quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  39,32,"Then, who does more wrong than one who talks a lie about Allah, and rejects the Truth when it comes to him! Is Hell not the home for disbelievers (and blasphemous)"
  39,33,And he (the man) who says the Truth and he who restates (and supports) it— Such men are those who do right
  39,34,"They shall have all that they wish for, in the Presence of their Lord: That is the reward for those who do good"
  39,35,So that Allah will remove from them the evil of (the worst of) their deeds and give them their reward to suit the best of what they have done
  39,36,"Is not Allah enough for His servant? But they (the wrongdoers) try to frighten you with other (gods) besides Him! And whom Allah leaves to wander, for him, there can be no guide"
  39,37,"And those whom Allah guides, for him there can be no one who can take them away (from the Straight Path). Is not Allah Supreme in Power (Aziz), Imposer of Retribution (Muntaqim)"
  39,38,"And truly, if you are to ask them: \"Who created the heavens and the earth?\" Surely, they would say, \"Allah.\" Say: \"Do you see then? The things that you invoke besides Allah— If Allah gives me some penalty, can they remove His penalty? Or if He gives some mercy for me, can they keep back His mercy from?\" Say: \"Sufficient is Allah for me! In Him trust those who put their trust"
  39,39,"Say: \"O my people! Do whatever you can: I will do (my part): But soon will you know—"
  39,40,"To whom comes a penalty of dishonor, and upon whom will fall a penalty that stays forever"
