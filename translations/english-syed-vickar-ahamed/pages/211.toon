quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  10,21,"And then We make Mankind taste of some mercy after pain (and sorrow) has touched them, they start to plot against Our Signs! Say: \"Allah! Is swifter to plan.\" Surely, Our messengers write down all the plots that you make"
  10,22,"It is He, Who enables you to travel by land and sea; So that when you get into ships— They (the ships) sail with them by the right wind, and they become happy with it; Then comes a stormy wind and the waves come to them from every side, and they think they are being overcome: Then they cry to Allah, truly offering (their) duty to Him, saying, \"If You save us from this, we shall truly show our thanks"
  10,23,"But when He saves them, behold! They exceed all limits proudly on earth against the right! O Mankind! Your insolence is against your own souls, an enjoyment of the life of the present! To Us is your return, in the end; And We shall show you the truth of all that you did"
  10,24,"Verily, the life of the present is like the rain which We send down from the skies: With its occurrence come the crops of the earth— Which provide food for men and animals: (They grow) till the earth wears its golden ornament and is strung out (in beauty): The people to whom it belongs think they have all the control over it (the earth): (However) by night or by day, Our Command reaches it and We make it like a harvest (crop) cleanly cut, as if it had not flourished the day before! Like this We explain in detail Our Signs for those who meditate"
  10,25,"But Allah does call (you) to the Home of Peace: He does guide whom He pleases to the Straight Path"
