quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,89,"And when there comes to them a Book from Allah, confirming what is with them— Although from the past they had prayed for victory against those without Faith— When there comes to them that which they (should) have recognized, they refuse to believe in it. But the curse of Allah is on those without Faith"
  2,90,"How bad is the price for which they have sold their souls, because they reject (the teachings) with hate; Which Allah has sent down; Allah by His Grace sends it (the teachings) to any of His servants He pleases. Thus they have drawn on themselves Anger upon Anger. And humiliating is the punishment for those who reject Faith"
  2,91,"And when it is said to them, \"Believe in what Allah has sent down,\" they say, \"We believe in what was sent down to us:\" Yet they reject everything that which came after it, while it be Truth confirming what is with them. Say, (O Prophet): \"Why then have you killed the prophets of Allah in earlier times, if you did truly believe"
  2,92,"And, indeed Musa (Moses) came to you with clear (Signs); Yet you still worshipped the calf after he left, and you did act wrongfully"
  2,93,"And (remember) when, We took your Promise and We raised above you Mount (Sinai, saying): \"Hold firmly to what We have given you, and obey:\" They said: \"We hear, and we disobey:\" And they had to take into their hearts the worship of the calf because they have no Faith. Say: \"The commands of your Faith are truly not enough— If you have any faith"
