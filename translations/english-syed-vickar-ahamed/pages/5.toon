quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,25,"And give glad tidings to those who believe and who act fairly and justly, that their reward is Gardens, beneath which rivers flow. Every time they are fed with fruits from there, they say: \"This is what we were fed with before,\" for they are given similar things; And in there, they have pure (and holy) companions and in there, they live (for ever)"
  2,26,"Indeed, Allah is not ashamed to use the similitude of things, even as low as the mosquito as well as the highest. Those who believe know that it is truth from their Lord; But those who reject Faith will say: \"What does Allah mean by this similitude?\" But He does not cause (people) to lose (their path) except those who give (themselves) up"
  2,27,"(And) those who break Allah’s Promise after it is accepted, and who tear apart what Allah has ordered to be joined, and who make mischief on earth; These cause loss (only) to themselves"
  2,28,"How can you reject the Faith in Allah? Seeing that you were without life, and He gave you life: Then He will cause you to die and (He) will again bring you to life; And again to Him you will return"
  2,29,"It is He Who has created all things for you that are on earth; In addition, His plans called for the heavens, and He gave Order and Perfection to the seven skies: And of all things He is All Knowing (Aleem)"
