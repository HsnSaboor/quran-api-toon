quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  62,9,"O you who believe! When the call is recited for prayer on Friday (the day of assembly), hurry sincerely to the Remembrance of Allah, and leave behind the business (and traffic): That is best for you if you only knew"
  62,10,"Then when the (Friday) prayer is finished, then may you may disperse through the land, and seek of the Grace and Bounty of Allah: And celebrate the Praises of Allah much and often (and without restriction): That you may be successful"
  62,11,"And when they see some bargain or some amusement, they leave to run to it, and leave you standing. Say: \"The (blessing) from the Presence of Allah is better than any amusement or bargain! And Allah is the Best to Provide (for all needs) (Khair-ur-Razikheen)"
  63,1,"When the hypocrites come to you, they say, \"We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allah.\" Allah knows that you are indeed His Messenger, and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are indeed liars"
  63,2,"They have made their oaths a way (to hide what they really are and) like this they stop (men) from the Path of Allah: Truly, their deeds are evil"
  63,3,"That is because they had believed, and then they disbelieved; So a seal was set on their hearts; Therefore, they do not understand"
  63,4,"And when you look at them, their bodies (that they show) please you; And when they speak, you listen to their words. They are like blocks of wood propped up, (unable to stand by themselves). They think that every cry is against them. They are the enemies, so (keep yourselves) beware of them. May the curse of Allah be on them! How are they deluded (away from the right truth)"
