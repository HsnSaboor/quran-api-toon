quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,111,"The Day when every soul will come forward struggling (and praying) for itself, and every soul will be paid back (in full) for all its actions, and no one will be unjustly treated"
  16,112,"And Allah brings forward a story: A city having (the comfort of) security and peace, well supplied with livelihood from every place: Yet it was still thankless for the gifts of Allah: So Allah made it taste hunger and fear (choking it) like a coat (from every side), because of what (its people) earned"
  16,113,"And there came to them a messenger from among themselves, but they falsely rejected him; So the Anger (of Allah) caught them even in the middle of their sins"
  16,114,"So (from the livelihood), eat lawful and good food that Allah has given to you; And be thankful for the Favors of Allah, if it is He Whom you serve"
  16,115,"He has only forbidden for you, meat from dead (animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine (any type of pig), and any (food) over, which the name of (anyone) other than Allah has been called upon. But if one is forced by (extreme) need, without willful disobedience, and not exceeding the rightful limits— Then, Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Merciful (Raheem)"
  16,116,"And do not say— For anything that is false that your tongues may put forth— \"This is lawful, and this is forbidden,\" so as to ascribe false things to Allah. Verily, those who ascribe false things to Allah, will never prosper"
  16,117,"(When such type of lies are spoken, there) is only a very little worthless profit; But they will have a most painful penalty"
  16,118,"And for the Jews (also), We prohibited such things like what We have told you before: We did not do them any wrong, but they were used to doing wrong to themselves"
