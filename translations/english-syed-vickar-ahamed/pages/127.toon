quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,114,"Isa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), said: \"O Allah, our Lord! Send us from heaven a Table set (with meats and food), that there may be for us— For the first and the last of us— A true and holy feast and a Sign from You; And provide for us the means to live, for You are the Best Provider (Khair-ur-Razikheen, of our needs)"
  5,115,"Allah said: \"I will send it (the Table) down to you: But if any of you does not accept faith after that, I will punish him with a penalty like that I have not inflicted on anyone from among all the peoples"
  5,116,"And remember! Allah will say (on the Day of Judgment): \"O Isa (Jesus) the son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say to men, ‘Worship me and my mother as gods in derogation of Allah’?\" He (Isa) will say: \"Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right to say. If I had said such a thing, You would indeed have known it. You know what is in my heart, even though I do not know what is in Yours. Truly, You fully know all that is hidden and unseen"
  5,117,"Never did I say to them anything except what You did command me to say, which is, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord: And I was a witness over them while I lived among them; When You did take me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness to all things"
  5,118,"If You do punish them, they are Your servants: If You do forgive them; Surely, You are the Almighty (Al-Aziz), the All Wise (Al-Hakeem)"
  5,119,"Allah will say: \"This is a day on which the truthful will profit from their truth: Theirs are Gardens, with rivers flowing below— Their eternal Home: Allah well-pleased with them, and they with Allah: That is the great Joy (and Peace, the fulfillment of all desires)"
  5,120,"To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is in there, and it is He Who is Able (Khadir) to do all things"
