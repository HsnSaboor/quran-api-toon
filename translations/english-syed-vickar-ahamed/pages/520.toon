quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,"And how many generations before them did We destroy (for their sins)— (Though) they were stronger in power than them? And they wandered through the land: Was there any place of escape (for them)"
  50,37,Surely in this there is a Reminder and a Message for anyone who has a heart and understanding or who gives ear and truly sees (the truth)
  50,38,"And indeed, We created the heavens and the earth and all between them in six Days, and no sense of tiredness touches Us"
  50,39,"Then bear with patience, all that they say, and celebrate the Praises of your Lord, before the rising of the sun (Faj’r) and before (its) setting (Zuh’r and ‘Asr)"
  50,40,"And during part of the night (Maghrib and Isha), (also) celebrate His praises and (glorify Him) after the prayers (of His adoration)"
  50,41,And listen on the Day when the Caller will call out from a place close by—
  50,42,"The Day when they will hear a (mighty) Blast in truth (for awakening): That will be the Day of Resurrection"
  50,43,"Surely, it is We Who give life and cause death; And to Us is the Final Return—"
  50,44,"On the Day when the earth will be torn apart, from (men) quickly getting out: That will be a gathering together— (It is) quite easy for Us"
  50,45,"We know best what they say, and you (O Prophet) are not the one to bring Faith in them by force. But warn (him, the weary and confused) with the Quran such as (he, who) fears My Warning"
  51,1,By (the winds) that scatter (around) the dust
  51,2,And those (winds) that lift and carry away heavy weights
  51,3,"And those that flow with ease, (joy) and gentleness"
  51,4,And those that distribute and rearrange by (His) Order—
  51,5,"Surely, that which you have been promised is indeed true"
  51,6,"And surely, Judgment and Recompense must indeed become established"
