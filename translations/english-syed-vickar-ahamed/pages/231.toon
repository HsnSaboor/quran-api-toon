quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,82,"So when Our Commandment came forth, We turned (their cities) upside down, and sent down upon them rains of stones: hard as baked clay, spread, layer upon layer—"
  11,83,"As if marked from your Lord, they (the stones and their cities) are not at all far apart: From those who do wrong"
  11,84,"And to the Madyan people, (We sent) Shu’aib, their brother: He said: \"O my people! Worship Allah: You have no other god but Him. And do not give short in measure or in weight: I see you in prosperity, and verily, I fear for you the penalty of a Day that will circle (you) all round"
  11,85,"And O my people! Give full measure and weight, in (total) justice and do not keep away from the people the things that are due to them: Do not do evil making mischief in the land causing corruption"
  11,86,"What is left for you by Allah is good for you, if you believe (in Him)! But I am not placed over you to keep watch"
  11,87,"They said: \"O Shu’aib! Does your prayer order you that we stop the worship our fathers practiced, or that we stop doing what we like with our property? Truly, you are the one who forgives (our) faults, and are right-minded"
  11,88,"He said: \"O my people! Tell me if I have a clear (proof) from my Lord, and He has given me good (and pure) livelihood from Himself, (shall I corrupt it with unjust money?), I do not wish to do what I forbid you to do. I only wish for (your) betterment to the best of my power (and ability); And my guidance can only come from Allah. In Him I trust, and to Him I look in repentance"
