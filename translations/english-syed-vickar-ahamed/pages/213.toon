quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"Say: \"Of your 'partners' can anyone originate creation and repeat it?\" Say: \"It is Allah Who begins creation and repeats it: Then why are you deceived away (from the truth)"
  10,35,"Say: \"From your 'partners', is there any that can give any guidance towards Truth?\" Say: \"It is Allah Who gives guidance towards Truth. Then, is He Who gives guidance to truth more worthy to be followed, or he who does not find guidance (for himself) unless he is guided? What then is the matter with you? How do you judge"
  10,36,"And most of them follow nothing but (their) wishes: Truly, wishes can be of no use against Truth. Surely, Allah is well aware of all that they do"
  10,37,"And this Quran is not like anything that can be produced by (anyone) other than Allah; But (for sure), it confirms the (revelations) that went before it, and a more complete explanation of the Book— In which there is no doubt— From the Lord of the Worlds"
  10,38,"Or do they (the disbelievers) say, \"He made it up?\" Say: \"Bring then a Sura of its like, and call (for your help) anyone you can, besides Allah, if it is that you speak the truth"
  10,39,"No! They say it is false that whose knowledge they cannot understand, even before its proof has reached them: Like this did those before them accuse as false: But see what was the end of those who did wrong"
  10,40,"And of them there are some who believe in it, and (there are) some who do not (believe): And your Lord knows best those who are there to make mischief"
  10,41,"If they accuse you with lies, say (to them): \"My work is for me, and yours is for you! You are free from responsibility about what I do, and I (am free from responsibility) about what you do"
  10,42,"And among them are some who (show as if they) listen to you: But can you make the deaf to hear— Even though they do not understand"
