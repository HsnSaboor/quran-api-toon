quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  14,6,"And remember! Musa (Moses) said to his people: \"Think of the gift from Allah to you when He saved you from the people of Firon (Pharaoh): They set you to hard work and punishments, killed your sons, and let your women live: And in there was a huge trial from your Lord"
  14,7,"And (also) remember! Your Lord has (openly) proclaimed: \"If you are thankful, I will add more (gifts) for you; But if you show thanklessness, verily, My (reference to Allah’s) punishment is really terrible"
  14,8,"And Musa (Moses) said: \"If you disbelieve (and show thanklessness), you and all on earth together— Then verily Allah is Free of all Wants (Ghani), Worthy of all Praise (Hameed)"
  14,9,"Has the story of those before you not reached you? Of the people of Nuh (Noah), and ‘Ad and Samood (Thamud) and of those who were after them? No one knows them but Allah. The messengers (from Allah) came to them with Clear (Signs): But they put their hands to their mouths, and said: \"Verily, we reject (the very purpose) for which you have been sent, and we are really in distrustful (uneasy) doubt about that to which you invite us"
  14,10,"Their messengers (from Allah) said: \"Is there a doubt about Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? It is He, Who invites you, so that He may forgive you for your sins and give you relief for a fixed time!\" They said: \"Oh! You are not any more than a human (being), like ourselves! You want to turn us away from the (gods) our fathers worshipped: Then bring us some clear authority"
