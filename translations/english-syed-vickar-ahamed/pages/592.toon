quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,But no! You prefer the life of this world
  87,17,But the Hereafter is better and (it) lasts longer
  87,18,And this is in the pages (of Books) of the very early (Revelations)—
  87,19,The pages (of Books) of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses)
  88,1,Has the story of The Overwhelming (Event) reached you
  88,2,"On that Day, some faces will suffer humiliation"
  88,3,Working (hard in) weariness—
  88,4,While they enter the blazing Fire—
  88,5,"While they are given, from a boiling hot spring (fluid), to drink"
  88,6,"No food will there be for them but a bitter Dhari’ (a dry, bitter and thorny fruit)"
  88,7,Which will neither nourish nor satisfy hunger
  88,8,On that Day (other) faces will be joyful
  88,9,Pleased with their struggle (of this life)—
  88,10,In a Garden raised high
  88,11,Where they shall not hear (empty words)
  88,12,In there will be a bubbling spring
  88,13,"In there will be Thrones (of dignity), raised high"
  88,14,Cups placed (ready)
  88,15,And cushions set in rows
  88,16,And rich carpets spread out
  88,17,"Do they (the unbelievers) not look at the Camels, how they are made"
  88,18,"And at the sky, how it is raised high"
  88,19,"And at the mountains, how they are fixed firm"
  88,20,"And at the earth, how it is spread out"
  88,21,"Therefore you (O Prophet) give Guidance: For you are the one to guide"
  88,22,You are not the one to manage (men’s) affairs
  88,23,But if any (one) turns away and rejects Allah—
  88,24,Allah will punish him with a severe punishment
  88,25,For to Us will be their return
  88,26,Then it will be for Us to call them to account
