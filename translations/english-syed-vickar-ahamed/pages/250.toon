quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  13,6,"They ask you to bring the evil sooner than the good: Yet before them, (many) severe punishments have come true! But surely your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind in spite of their evil actions, and surely, your Lord is (also) strict in punishment"
  13,7,"And the disbelievers say: \"Why is a Sign not sent down to him (the Prophet) from his Lord?\"— You are truly a warner, and to every people there is a guide"
  13,8,"Allah knows what every female (womb) bears, and by how much the wombs fall short or exceed (their time or numbers). Everything is in (proper) proportion before His Sight"
  13,9,"He knows the Unseen and the seen: (He is) the Most Great (Al-Kabir), the Most High (Al-Mathed’al)"
  13,10,"It is the same (to Him) whether any of you hides his (the human) speech or says it openly: Whether he lies hidden by night or walks out freely by the day"
  13,11,"For each one (human), there are (angels) one following the other, before and behind him: They guard him by the command of Allah. Surely Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change it themselves. But when Allah wills a punishment for a people, there is no holding it back; Nor will they find, anyone other than Him, to protect them"
  13,12,"It is He Who shows you the lightning, both as fear and as hope: And it is He Who raises up the clouds, heavy with rain"
  13,13,"And more, the thunder repeats His Praises, and glorifies Him, like the angels do, with respect and fear: He throws the loud resounding thunder-bolts, and with it He strikes whomsoever He wills— Even then they (the disbelievers) dispute about Allah, and He is Mighty in strength (Sad’eed) and severe in punishment (Al-Me’hal)"
