quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  42,32,"And among His Signs are the ships, running smoothly through the oceans, (tall) as mountains"
  42,33,"If He so wills, He can stop the wind: Then would they become motionless on the back of the (seas). Surely, in this are Signs for everyone who patiently perseveres and is grateful"

  42,43,"And indeed whoever shows patience and forgiveness, that would truly be an act of bold will, (and resolution in the conduct of affairs) is truly recommended by Allah"
  42,44,"For any (of those) whom Allah leaves astray, there is no protector after Him. You will see the wrongdoers, when the penalty is close; Saying: \"Is there any way to come back"
