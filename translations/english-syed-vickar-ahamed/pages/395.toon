quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,78,"He said: \"This (wealth) has been given to me only because of a certain knowledge which I have.\" Did he not know that Allah had ruined, before him, (whole) generations— Which were superior to him in strength and exceeded in the amount (of riches) that they h.ad collected? But the wicked are not called (right away) to account for their sins"
  28,79,"So he went before his (own showy) people with the (pride of his worldly) show. Those whose goal is the life of this world, said: \"Oh! If only we had the (wealth) like what Qarun (Qaroon) has got! Verily, he is truly a lord of very good fortune"
  28,80,"But those who had been given (true) knowledge said: \"Sorrow for (woe unto) you! The reward of Allah (in the Hereafter) is best for those who believe and act righteousness: But this no one will get, except those who continuously persevere (in good)"
  28,81,"So, then We made the earth to swallow him up and his house; And he had not (the smallest) group to help him against Allah, and he could not protect himself"
  28,82,"And those who wished his position the day before began to say the next day: \"Ah! It is truly Allah, Who grows the provision or shrinks it, to any of His servants He pleases! If it was not that Allah was kind to us, he could have caused the earth to swallow us up! Those who disbelieve will never be successful"
  28,83,"We will give that Home of the Hereafter to those who do not want arrogance or mischief on earth: And the end is (best) for the righteous"
  28,84,"If any does good, the reward for him is better than his deed; But if any does evil, the doers of evil are only punished to the extent of their deeds"
