quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,60,"And those who give out their charity with their hearts full of fear, because they will return to their Lord—"
  23,61,"It is these who are quick in every good work, and these who are first among them (who are good)"
  23,62,"And We place not a burden upon anyone except according to the capacity of the person: And with Us is a record clearly showing the truth: And they will never be wronged"
  23,63,"But (for some) their hearts are unclear and uninformed about this; And therein lie their (evil) actions, which they will (continue) to do—"
  23,64,"Till (that time), when We grip in Punishment those of them who received the good things of this world, behold! They will groan (in pain and) in hurt"
  23,65,"(It will be said ): \"Do not groan in (pain and) hurt today; Certainly, you will not be helped by Us"
  23,66,"Indeed, My (Allah’s) Signs used to be recited to you, but you used to go back (running) on your heels—"
  23,67,"In defiance, (while) talking nonsense about (the Quran), like someone is saying (false) stories by night"
  23,68,"Do they not think deeply over the Word (of Allah), or has anything (new) come to them (now) that did not already come to their fathers of old"
  23,69,Or do they not recognize their Messenger (Muhammad) that they reject him
  23,70,"Or do they say: \"Is there madness (deep) in him?\" No! He has brought them the truth, but most of them hate the truth"
  23,71,"And if the truth was according to their desires, surely, the heavens and the earth, and all the beings in there will be in confusion and ruin! No! We have sent them their reminder (and guidance), but they turn away from their warning"
  23,72,"Or is it that you ask them for wages or reward? But the repayment of your Lord is best: He is the Best of those who give livelihood (Khair-ur-Razikeen)"
  23,73,But surely you call them to the Straight Way
  23,74,"And certainly, those who do not believe in the Hereafter are wandering away from that Path (Seerath)"
