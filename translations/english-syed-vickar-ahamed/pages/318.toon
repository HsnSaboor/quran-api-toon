  20,88,"Then he (As-Samiri) brought out (of the fire) the image of a calf before the (people): It seemed to moo (like a low noise of a cow): So they said: ‘This is your god, and the god of Musa (Moses), but he (Musa) has forgotten (his god)!’"
  20,89,"Could they not see that it could not reply a word to them, and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them (any) good"
  20,90,"And before this, Haroon (Aaron) had already said to them: \"O my people! You are being tested in this: And surely, your Lord is (Allah) the Most Gracious (Rahman): So follow me and obey my command"
  20,91,"They had said (to Haroon): \"We will not stop this worship, till Musa (Moses) returns to us"
  20,92,"Musa (Moses)] said: \"O Haroon (Aaron)! What stopped you, (even) though you saw them going wrong"

  20,94,"Haroon (Aaron)] replied: \"O son of my mother! Do not grab (me) by my beard, nor by (the hair of) my head! Truly, I feared that you may say; ‘You have caused a split in the Children of Israel, and you did not respect my word!’"
  20,95,"Musa (Moses)] said: \"Then, what is your case, O Samiri"
  20,96,"He replied: \"I saw what they did not see: So I took a handful (of dust) from the footprint of the messenger, and threw it (into the calf): Thus did my soul tell me"
  20,97,"Musa (Moses)] said: \"Then, be gone! And surely your (punishment) in this life will be that you will say, ‘Do not touch me’: And verily (as future punishment), you have a promise (a curse) that will not fail: Now look at your god, of whom you have become a true worshipper: We will surely (melt) it in a (hot) burning fire and throw it far and wide in the sea"
  20,98,"But the God for all of you is One Allah: There is no god but He: He understands all things in His Wisdom"
