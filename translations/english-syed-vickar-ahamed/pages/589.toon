quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,On Thrones (of dignity) they will be able to see a view (of all things)
  83,36,Will not the unbelievers have been paid back for what they did
  84,1,When the sky is split apart
  84,2,"And obeys the command of its Lord, and it must do so"
  84,3,And when the earth is flattened out
  84,4,And spills over what is within it and becomes empty
  84,5,"And obeys the command of its Lord, and it must do so"
  84,6,O you man! You are surely always moving towards your Lord painfully moving but you shall meet Him
  84,7,Then he who is given his record (of deeds) in his right hand
  84,8,Soon his account will be taken by an easy settlement
  84,9,"And he will be together with his people, happy"
  84,10,But he who is given his record behind his back
  84,11,Soon will he cry for his lost soul
  84,12,"And, he will enter a blazing Fire"
  84,13,"Truly, (on this earth) did he go about among his people, happy"
  84,14,"Truly, did he think that he would not have to return (to Us)"
  84,15,"But, for sure! His Lord was (always) watchful of him"
  84,16,"So, I swear by the deep (red) glow of sunset"
  84,17,The night and its gathering (of nightly creatures)
  84,18,And the moon in her fullness
  84,19,You shall surely travel from one stage to the next (life to Hereafter)
  84,20,"What then, is the matter with them that they do not believe"
  84,21,"And when the Quran is read to them, they do not fall prostrate"
  84,22,But being the opposite the unbelievers reject (Islam and the Message)
  84,23,But Allah has full knowledge of what they do and think
  84,24,So announce to them a painful penalty
  84,25,"Except to those who believe and work righteous good deeds: For them is a reward that will never be the end"
