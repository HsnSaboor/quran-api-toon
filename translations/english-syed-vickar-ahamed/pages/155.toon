quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,38,"He (Allah) will say: \"You enter the company of the peoples who passed away before you— Men and jinns'— Into the Fire.\" Every time a new (group of) people enters, it curses its peoples of related place (and time before) until they follow each other, all into the Fire. Say the last (group) about the first (group): \"Our Lord! It is these (people) who misled us: So give them a double the penalty of the Fire.\" He will say: \"Doubled for all:\" But this you do not understand"
  7,39,"Then the first (group) will say to the last (one): \"Now you see! You have no advantage over us; So you taste the penalty for all that you did"
  7,40,"Verily, for those (people) who deny Our Signs and treat them with displeasure and false pride, there will be no opening of the gates of heavens, and they will not enter the Garden, until the camel can pass through the eye of the needle: Our reward is like this for those in sin"
  7,41,"For them there is Hell, as a seat (to hold them from below) and folds and folds (of Fire) for covering above: Our repayment is like this for those who do wrong"
  7,42,"But for those who believe and do righteousness— We place no burden on any soul, except that which it can bear- They will be Companions of the Garden, to live in there (for ever)"
  7,43,"And We shall remove from their hearts any left over sense of hurt— Beneath them will be rivers flowing— And they shall say: \"Praises (and thanks) be to Allah, Who has guided us to this (happiness): We could never have found guidance, if it was not for the Guidance of Allah: Indeed it was the truth that the messengers of our Lord brought to us,\" and they shall hear the cry: \"Look! The Gardens before you! You have been made to take them over, because of your acts (of righteousness)"
