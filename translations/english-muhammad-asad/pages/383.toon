quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  27,64,"Nay - who is it that creates [all life] in the first instance, and then brings it forth anew? And who is it that provides you with sustenance out of heaven and earth? Could there be any divine power besides God? Say: “[If you think so,] produce your evidence - if you truly believe in your claim!”"
  27,65,"Say: “None in the heavens or on earth knows the hidden reality [of anything that exists: none knows it] save God.” And neither can they [who are living] perceive when they shall be raised from the dead"
  27,66,"nay, their knowledge of the life to come stops short of the truth: nay, they are [often] in doubt as to its reality: nay, they are blind to it"
  27,67,"And so, they who are bent on denying the truth are saying: “What! After we have become dust - we and our forefathers - shall we [all], forsooth, be brought forth [from the dead]"
  27,68,"Indeed, we were promised this - we and our forefathers - in the past as well; it is nothing but fables of ancient times!”"
  27,69,"Say: “Go all over the earth and behold what happened in the end to those [who were thus] lost in sin!”"
  27,70,"But do not grieve over them, and neither be distressed by the false arguments which they devise [against God's messages]"
  27,71,"And [when] they ask, “When is this promise [of resurrection] to be fulfilled? [Answer this, O you who believe in it,] if you are men of truth!” –"
  27,72,"say thou: “It may well be that something of that which [in your ignorance] you so hastily demands has already drawn close unto you.”"
  27,73,"Now, verily, thy Sustainer is indeed limitless in His bounty unto men - but most of them are bereft of gratitude"
  27,74,"But, verily, thy Sustainer knows all that their hearts conceal as well as all that they bring into the open"
  27,75,"for there is nothing [so deeply] hidden in the heavens or on earth but is recorded in [His] clear decree"
  27,76,"BEHOLD, this Qur’an explains to the children of Israel most [of that] whereon they hold divergent views"
