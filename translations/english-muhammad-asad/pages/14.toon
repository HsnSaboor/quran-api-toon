quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,89,"And whenever there came unto them a [new] revelation from God, confirming the truth already in their possession-and [bear in mind that] aforetime they used to pray for victory over those who were bent on denying the truth -: whenever there came unto them something which they recognized [as the truth], they would deny it. And God's rejection is the due of all who deny the truth"
  2,90,"Vile is that [false pride] for which they have sold their own selves by denying the truth of what God has bestowed from on high, out of envy that God should bestow aught of His favour upon whomsoever He wills of His servants: and thus have they earned the burden of God's condemnation, over and over. And for those who deny the truth there is shameful suffering in store"
  2,91,"For when they are told, \"Believe in what God has bestowed from on high,\" they reply, \"We believe [only] in what has been bestowed on us\"-and they deny the truth of everything else, although it be a truth confirming the one already in their possession. Say \"Why, then, did you slay God's prophets aforetime, if you were (truly] believers"
  2,92,"And indeed, there came unto you Moses with all evidence of the truth - and thereupon. in his absence, you took to worshipping the (golden] calf, and acted wickedly"
  2,93,"And, lo, We accepted your solemn pledge, raising Mount Sinai high above you, [saying,] \"Hold fast with [all your] strength unto what We have vouchsafed you, and hearken unto it!\" [But] they say, \"We have heard, but we disobey\" - for their hearts are filled to overflowing with love of the [golden] calf because of their refusal to acknowledge the truth. Say: \"Vile is what this [false] belief of yours enjoins upon you-if indeed you are believers"
