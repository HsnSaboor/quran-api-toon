  36,13,"AND SET FORTH unto them a parable - [the story of how] the people of a township [behaved] when [Our] message-bearers came unto them"
  36,14,"Lo! We sent unto them two [apostles], and. they gave the lie to both; and so We strengthened [the two] with a third; and thereupon they said: “Behold, we have been sent unto you [by God]!”"
  36,15,"[The others] answered: “You are nothing but mortal men like ourselves; moreover, the Most Gracious has never bestowed aught [of revelation] from on high. You do nothing but lie!”"
  36,16,"Said [the apostles]: “Our Sustainer knows that we have indeed been sent unto you"
  36,17,"but we are not bound to do more than clearly deliver the message [entrusted to us].”"
  36,18,"Said [the others]: “Truly, we augur evil from you! Indeed, if you desist not, we will surely stone you, and grievous suffering is bound to befall you at our hands!”"
  36,19,"[The apostles] replied: “Your destiny, good or evil, is [bound up] with yourselves! [Does it seem evil to you] if you are told to take [the truth] to heart? Nay, but you are people who have wasted their own selves!”"
  36,20,"At that, a man came running from the farthest end of the city, [and] exclaimed: “O my people! Follow these message-bearers"
  36,21,"Follow those who ask no reward of you, and themselves are rightly guided"
  36,22,"“[As for me,] why should I not worship Him who has brought me into being, and to whom you all will be brought back"
  36,23,"Should I take to worshipping [other] deities beside Him? [But then,] if the Most Gracious should will that harm befall me, their intercession could not in the least avail me, nor could they save me"
  36,24,"and so, behold, I would have indeed, most obviously, lost myself in error"
  36,25,"“Verily, [O my people,] in the Sustainer of you all have I come to believe: listen, then, to me!”"
  36,26,"[And] he was told, “[Thou shalt] enter paradise!” - [whereupon] he exclaimed: “Would that my people knew"
  36,27,"how my Sustainer has forgiven me [the sins of my past], and has placed me among the honoured ones!”"
