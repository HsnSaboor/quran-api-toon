  23,29,"“And say: ‘O my Sustainer! Cause me to reach a destination blessed [by Thee] for Thou art the best to show man how to reach his [true] destination!’”"
  23,30,"In this [story], behold, there are messages indeed [for those who think]: for, verily, We always put [man] to a test"
  23,31,"AND AFTER those [people of old] We gave rise to new generations"
  23,32,"and [every time] We sent unto them an apostle from among themselves, [he told them:] “Worship God [alone]: you have no deity other than Him. Will you not, then, become conscious of Him?”"
  23,33,"And [every time] the great ones among his people, who refused to acknowledge the truth and gave the lie to the announcement of a life to come - [simply] because We had granted them ease and plenty in [their] worldly life, and they had become corrupted by it [every time] they would say: “This [man] is nothing hut a mortal like yourselves, eating of what you eat, and drinking of what you drink"
  23,34,"and, indeed, if you pay heed to a mortal like yourselves, you will surely be the losers"
  23,35,"Does he promise you that, after you have died and become [mere] dust and bones, you shall be brought forth [to a new life]"

  23,40,"[And God] would say: “After a little while they will surely be smitten with remorse!”"
  23,41,"And then the blast [of Our punishment] overtook them, justly and unavoidably, and We caused them to become as the flotsam of dead leaves and the scum borne on the surface of a torrent: and so - away with those evildoing folk"
  23,42,AND AFTER them We gave rise to new generations
