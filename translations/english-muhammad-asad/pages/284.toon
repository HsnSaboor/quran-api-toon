  17,18,"Unto him who cares for [no more than the enjoyment of] this fleeting life We readily grant thereof as much as We please, [giving] to whomever it is Our will [to give]; but in the end We consign him to [the suffering of] hell; which he will have to endure disgraced and disowned"
  17,19,"But as for those who care for the [good of the] life to come, and strive for it as it ought to be striven for, and are [true] believers withal -they are the ones whose striving finds favour [with God]"
  17,20,"All [of them] -these as well as those -do We freely endow with some of thy Sustainer's gifts, since thy Sustainer's giving is never confined [to one kind of man]"
  17,21,"Behold how We bestow [on earth) more bounty on some of them than on others: but [remember that] the life to come will be far higher in degree and far greater in merit and bounty"
  17,22,"DO NOT set up any other deity side by side with God, lest thou find thyself disgraced and forsaken"
  17,23,"for thy Sustainer has ordained that you shall worship none but Him. And do good unto [thy] parents. Should one of them, or both, attain to old age in thy care, never say \"Ugh\" to them or scold them, but [always] speak unto them with reverent speech"
  17,24,"and spread over them humbly the wings of thy tenderness, and say: \"O my Sustainer! Bestow Thy grace upon them, even as they cherished and reared me when I was a child"
  17,25,"Your Sustainer is fully aware of what is in your hearts. If you are righteous, [He will forgive you your errors]: for, behold, He is much-forgiving to those who turn unto Him again and again"
  17,26,"And give his due to the near of kin, as well as to the needy and the wayfarer, but do not squander [thy substance] senselessly"
  17,27,"Behold, the squanderers are, indeed, of the ilk of the satans - inasmuch as Satan has indeed proved most ungrateful to his Sustainer"
