quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  12,96,"But when the bearer of good tidings came [with Joseph's tunic], he laid it over his face; and he regained his sight, [and] exclaimed: \"Did I not tell you, `Verily, I know, from God, something that you do not know"
  12,97,"[His sons] answered: \"O our father! Ask God to forgive us our sins, for, verily, we were sinners"
  12,98,"He said: \"I shall ask my Sustainer to forgive you: He alone is truly forgiving, a true dispenser of grace"
  12,99,"AND WHEN they [all arrived in Egypt and] presented themselves before Joseph, he drew his parents unto himself, saying, \"Enter Egypt! If God so wills, you shall be secure [from all evil]"
  12,100,"And he raised his parents to the highest place of honour; and they [all] fell down before Him, prostrating themselves in adoration. Thereupon [Joseph] said: \"O my father! This is the real meaning of my dream of long ago, which my Sustainer has made come true. And He was indeed good to me when He freed me from the prison, and [when] He brought you [all unto me] from the desert after Satan had sown discord between me and my brothers. Verily, my Sustainer is unfathomable in [the way He brings about] whatever He wills: verily, He alone is all-knowing, truly wise"
  12,101,"O my Sustainer! Thou hast indeed bestowed upon me something of power, and hast imparted unto me some knowledge of the inner meaning of happenings. Originator of the heavens and the earth! Thou art near unto me in this world and in the life to come: let me die as one who has surrendered himself unto Thee, and make me one with the righteous"
  12,102,"THIS ACCOUNT of something that was beyond the reach of thy perception We [now] reveal unto thee, [O Prophet:] for thou wert not with Joseph's brothers when they resolved upon what they were going to do and wove their schemes [against him]"
  12,103,"Yet - however strongly thou mayest desire it -most people will not believe [in this revelation]"
