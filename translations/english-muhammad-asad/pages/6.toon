quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,30,"AND LO! Thy Sustainer said unto the angels: \"Behold, I am about to establish upon earth one who shall inherit it.\" They said: \"Wilt Thou place on it such as will spread corruption thereon and shed blood -whereas it is we who extol Thy limitless glory, and praise Thee, and hallow Thy name?\" [God] answered: \"Verily, I know that which you do not know"
  2,31,"And He imparted unto Adam the names of all things; then He brought them within the ken of the angels and said: \"Declare unto Me the names of these [things], if what you say is true"
  2,32,"They replied: \"Limitless art Thou in Thy glory! No knowledge have we save that which Thou hast imparted unto us. Verily, Thou alone art all-knowing, truly wise"
  2,33,"Said He: \"O Adam, convey unto them the names of these [things].\" And as soon as [Adam] had conveyed unto them their names, [God] said: \"Did I not say unto you, `Verily, I alone know the hidden reality of the heavens and the earth, and know all that you bring into the open and all. that you would conceal"
  2,34,"And when We told the angels, \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam!\" -they all prostrated themselves, save Iblis, who refused and gloried in his arrogance: and thus he became one of those who deny the truth"
  2,35,"And We said: \"O Adam, dwell thou and thy wife in this garden, and eat freely thereof, both of you, whatever you may wish; but do not approach this one tree, lest you become wrongdoers"
  2,36,"But Satan caused them both to stumble therein, and thus brought about the loss of their erstwhile state. And so We said: \"Down with you, [and be henceforth] enemies unto one another; and on earth you shall have your abode and your livelihood for a while"
  2,37,"Thereupon Adam received words [of guidance] from his Sustainer, and He accepted his repentance: for, verily, He alone is the-Acceptor of Repentance, the Dispenser of Grace"
