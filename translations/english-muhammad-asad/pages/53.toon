  3,23,"Art thou not aware of those who have been granted their share of revelation [aforetime]? They have been called upon to let God's writ be their law - and yet some of them turn away [from it] in their obstinacy"
  3,24,"simply because they claim, \"The fire will most certainly not touch us for more than a limited number of days\": and thus the false beliefs which they invented have [in time] caused them to betray their faith"
  3,25,"How, then, [will they fare] when We shall gather them all together to witness the Day about [the coming of] which there is no doubt, and every human being shall be repaid in full for what he has done, and none shall be wronged"
  3,26,"SAY: \"O God, Lord of all dominion! Thou grantest dominion unto whom Thou willest, and takest away dominion from whom Thou willest; and Thou exaltest whom Thou willest, and abasest whom Thou willest. In Thy hand is all good. Verily, Thou hast the power to will anything"

But God warns you to beware of Him: for with God is all journeys' end"
  3,29,"Say: \"Whether you conceal what is in your hearts or bring it into the open, God knows it: for He knows all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth; and God has the power to will anything"
