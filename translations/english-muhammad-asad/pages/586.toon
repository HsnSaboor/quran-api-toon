quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,THEN THE SUN is shrouded in darkness
  81,2,and when the stars lose their light
  81,3,and when the mountains are made to vanish
  81,4,"and when she-camels big with young, about to give birth, are left untended"
  81,5,and when all beasts are gathered together
  81,6,and when the seas boil over
  81,7,"and when all human beings are coupled [with their deeds]"
  81,8,and when the girl-child that was buried alive is made to ask
  81,9,for what crime she had been slain
  81,10,"and when the scrolls [of men's deeds] are unfolded"
  81,11,and when heaven is laid bare
  81,12,"and when the blazing fire [of hell] is kindled bright"
  81,13,and when paradise is brought into view
  81,14,"[on that Day] every human being will come to know what he has prepared [for himself]"
  81,15,BUT NAY! I call to witness the revolving stars
  81,16,the planets that run their course and set
  81,17,and the night as it darkly falls
  81,18,and the morn as it softly breathes
  81,19,"behold, this [divine writ] is indeed the [inspired] word of a noble apostle"
  81,20,"with strength endowed, secure with Him who in almightiness is enthroned"
  81,21,"[the word] of one to be heeded, and worthy of trust"
  81,22,"For, this fellow-man of yours is not a madman"
  81,23,"he truly beheld [the angel - beheld] him on the clear horizon"
  81,24,"and he is not one to begrudge others the knowledge [of whatever has been revealed to him] out of that which is beyond the reach of human Perception"
  81,25,"Nor is this [message] the word of any satanic force accursed"
  81,26,"Whither, then, will you go"
  81,27,"This [message] is no less than a reminder to all mankind –"
  81,28,to everyone of you who wills to walk a straight way
  81,29,"But you cannot will it unless God, the Sustainer of all the worlds, wills [to show you that way]"
