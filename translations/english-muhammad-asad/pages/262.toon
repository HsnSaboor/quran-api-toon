quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  15,1,Alif. Lam. Ra. THESE ARE MESSAGES of revelation -of a discourse clear in itself and clearly showing the truth
  15,2,"And it will come to pass that those who are [now] bent on denying this truth will wish that they had surrendered themselves to God [in their life time]"
  15,3,"Leave them alone; let them eat and enjoy themselves the while the hope [of vain delights] be guiles them: for in time they will come to know [the truth]"
  15,4,"And never have We destroyed any community [for its wrongdoing] unless a divine writ had (previously] been made known to it"
  15,5,"[but remember that] no community can ever forestall [the end of] its term - and neither can they delay [it]"
  15,6,"And yet, they [who deny the truth] say: \"O thou unto whom this reminder has [allegedly] been bestowed from on high: verily, thou art mad"
  15,7,"Why dost thou not bring before us angels, if thou art a man of truth"
  15,8,"[Yet] We never send down angels otherwise than in accordance with the [demands of] truth; and [were the angels to appear now,] lo! they [who reject this divine writ] would have no further respite"
  15,9,"Behold, it is We Ourselves who have bestowed from on high, step by step, this reminder? and, behold, it is We who shall truly guard it [from all corruption]"
  15,10,"AND, INDEED, [O Prophet,] even before thy time did We send [Our apostles] unto communities of old"
  15,11,and never yet came an apostle to them without their deriding him
  15,12,"Even so do We [now] cause this [scorn of Our message] to pervade the hearts of those who are lost in sin"
  15,13,"who do not believe in it, although the way which those [evildoers] of olden times had to go has long been within their ken"
  15,14,"Yet even had We opened to them a gateway to heaven and they had ascended, on and on, up to it"
  15,15,"they would surely have said, \"It is only our eyes that are spellbound! Nay, we have been bewitched"
