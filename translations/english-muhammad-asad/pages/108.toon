quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,6,"O YOU who have attained to faith! When you are about to pray, wash your face, and your hands and arms up to the elbows, and pass your [wet] hands lightly over your head, and [wash] your feet up to the ankles. And if you are in a state. requiring total ablution, purify yourselves. But if you are ill, or are travelling, or have just satisfied a want of nature, or have cohabited with a woman, and can find no water-then take resort to pure dust, passing therewith lightly over your face and your hands. God does not want to impose any hardship on you, but wants to make you pure, and to bestow upon you the full measure of His blessings, so that you might have cause to be grateful"
  5,7,"And [always] remember the blessings which God has bestowed upon you, and the solemn pledge by which He bound you to Himself when you said, \"We have heard, and we pay heed.\" Hence, remain conscious of God: verily, God has full knowledge of what is in the hearts [of men]"
  5,8,"O YOU who have attained to faith! Be ever steadfast in your devotion to God, bearing witness to the truth in all equity; and never let hatred of any-one lead you into the sin of deviating from justice. Be just: this is closest to being God-conscious. And remain conscious of God: verily, God is aware of all that you do"
  5,9,"God has promised unto those who attain to faith and do good works [that] theirs shall be forgiveness of sins, and a mighty reward"
