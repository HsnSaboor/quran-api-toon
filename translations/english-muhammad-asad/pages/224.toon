  11,20,"Never can they elude [their final reckoning, even if they remain unscathed] on earth: never will they find anyone who could protect them from God. [In the life to come] double suffering will be imposed on them for having lost the ability to hear [the truth] and having failed to see [it]"
  11,21,"It is they who have squandered their own selves-for [on the Day of Resurrection] all their false imagery will have forsaken them"
  11,22,"truly it is they, they who in the life to come shall be the losers"
  11,23,"Behold, [only] those who attain to faith and do righteous deeds and humble themselves before their Sustainer - [only] they are destined for paradise, and there shall they abide"
  11,24,"These two kinds of man may be likened to the blind and deaf and the seeing and hearing. Can these two be deemed alike in [their] nature? ` Will you not, then, keep this in mind"
  11,25,"AND INDEED, [it was with the same message that] We sent forth Noah unto his people: \"Behold, I come unto you with the plain warning"
  11,26,"that you may worship none but God-for, verily, I fear lest suffering befall you on a grievous Day"
  11,27,"But the great ones among his people, who refused to acknowledge the truth, answered: \"We do not see in thee anything but a mortal man like ourselves; and we do not see that any follow thee save those who are quite obviously the most abject among us; and we do not see that you could be in any way superior to us: on the contrary, we think that you are liars"
  11,28,"Said [Noah]: \"O my people! What do you think? If [it be true that I am taking my stand on a clear evidence from my~ Sustainer, who has vouchsafed unto me grace from Himself - [a revelation] to which you have remained blind-: [if this be true,] can we force it on you even though it be hateful to you"
