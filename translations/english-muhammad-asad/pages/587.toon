quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,WHEN THE SKY is cleft asunder
  82,2,and when the stars are scattered
  82,3,and when the seas burst beyond their bounds
  82,4,and when the graves are overturned –
  82,5,"every human being will [at last] comprehend, what he has sent ahead and what he has held back [in this world]"
  82,6,O MAN! What is it that lures thee away from thy bountiful Sustainer
  82,7,"who has created thee, and formed thee in accordance with what thou art meant' to be, and shaped thy nature in just proportions"
  82,8,"having put thee together in whatever form He willed [thee to have]"
  82,9,"Nay, [O men,] but you [are lured away from God whenever you are tempted to] give the lie to [God’s] Judgment"
  82,10,"And yet, verily, there are ever-watchful forces over you"
  82,11,"noble, recording"
  82,12,aware of whatever you do
  82,13,"Behold, [in the life to come] the truly virtuous: will indeed be in bliss"
  82,14,"whereas, behold, the wicked will indeed be in a blazing fire –"
  82,15,"[a fire] which they shall enter on Judgment Day"
  82,16,"and which they shall not [be able to] evade"
  82,17,And what could make thee conceive what that Judgment Day will be
  82,18,"And once again: What could make thee conceive what that Judgment Day will be"
  82,19,"[It will be] a Day when no human being shall be of the least avail to another human being: for on that Day [it will become manifest that] all sovereignty is God's alone"
  83,1,WOE UNTO THOSE who give short measure
  83,2,"those who, when they are to receive their due from [other] people, demand that it be given in full –"
  83,3,"but when they have to measure or weigh whatever they owe to others, give less than what is due"
  83,4,Do they not know that they are bound to be raised from the dead
  83,5,"[and called to account] on an awesome Day –"
  83,6,the Day when all men shall stand before the Sustainer of all the worlds
