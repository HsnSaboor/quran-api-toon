quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,Lo! His Sustainer called out to him in the twice-hallowed valley
  79,17,"Go unto Pharaoh - for, verily, he has transgressed all bounds of what is right"
  79,18,"and say [unto him], 'Art thou desirous of attaining to purity"
  79,19,"[If so,] then I shall guide thee towards [a cognition of] thy Sustainer, so that [henceforth] thou wilt stand in awe [of Him].’"
  79,20,"And thereupon he [went to Pharaoh and] made him aware of the great wonder [of God's grace]"
  79,21,"But [Pharaoh] gave him the lie and rebelliously rejected [all guidance]"
  79,22,"and brusquely turned his back [on Moses]"
  79,23,"and then he gathered [his great ones], and called [unto his people]"
  79,24,"and said, \"I am your Lord All-Highest"
  79,25,"And thereupon God took him to task, [and made him] a warning example in the life to come as well as in this world"
  79,26,"In this, behold, there is a lesson indeed for all who stand in awe [of God]"
  79,27,"[O MEN!] Are you more difficult to create than the heaven which He has built"
  79,28,High has He reared its vault and formed it in accordance with what it was meant to be
  79,29,and He has made dark its night and brought forth its light of day
  79,30,"And after that, the earth: wide has He spread its expanse"
  79,31,"and has caused its waters to come out of it, and its pastures"
  79,32,and has made the mountains firm
  79,33,"[all this] as a means of livelihood for you and your animals"
  79,34,"AND SO, when the great overwhelming event [of, resurrection] comes to pass –"
  79,35,"on that Day man will [clearly] remember all that he has ever wrought"
  79,36,"and the blazing fire [of hell] will be lad open before all who [are destined to] see it"
  79,37,"For, unto him who shall have transgressed the bounds of what is right"
  79,38,"and preferred the life of this world [to the good of his soul]"
  79,39,that blazing fire will truly be the goal
  79,40,"But unto him who shall have stood in fear of his Sustainer's Presence, and held back his inner self from base desires"
  79,41,paradise will truly be the goal
  79,42,"THEY WILL ASK thee [O Prophet] about the Last Hour: \"When will it come to pass"
  79,43,"[But] how couldst thou tell anything about it"
  79,44,"[seeing that] with thy Sustainer alone rests the beginning and the end [of all knowledge] thereof"
  79,45,"Thou art but [sent] to warn those who stand in awe of it"
  79,46,"On the Day when they behold it, [it will seem to them] as if they had tarried [in this world] no longer than one evening or [one night, ending with] its morn"
