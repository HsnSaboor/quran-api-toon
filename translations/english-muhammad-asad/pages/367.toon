  26,1,"Ta. Sin, Mim"
  26,2,"THESE ARE MESSAGES of the divine writ, clear in itself and clearly showing the truth"
  26,3,"Wouldst thou, perhaps, torment thyself to death [with grief] because they [who live around thee] refuse to believe [in it]"
  26,4,"Had We so willed, We could have sent down unto them a message from the skies, so that their necks would [be forced to] bow down before it in humility"
  26,5,"[But We have not willed it:] and so, whenever there comes unto them any fresh reminder from the Most Gracious, they [who are blind of heart] always - turn their backs upon it"
  26,6,"thus, indeed, have they given the lie (to this message as well). But [in time] they will come to understand what it was that they were wont to deride"
  26,7,"Have they, then, never considered the earth - how much of every noble kind [of life] We have caused to grow thereon"
  26,8,"In this, behold, there is a message [unto men], even though most of them will not believe [in it]"
  26,9,"But, verily, thy Sustainer - He alone - is almighty, a dispenser of grace"
  26,10,"HENCE, [remember how it was] when thy Sustainer summoned Moses: “Go unto those evil doing people"
  26,11,"the people of Pharaoh, who refuse to be conscious of Me!”"
  26,12,"He answered: “O my Sustainer! Behold, I fear that they will give me the lie"
  26,13,"and then my breast will be straitened and my tongue will not be free: send, then, [this Thy command] to Aaron"
  26,14,"Moreover, they keep a grave charge [pending] against me, and I fear that they will slay me.”"
  26,15,"Said He: “Not so, indeed! Go forth, then, both of you, with Our messages: verify, We shall be with you, listening [to your call]"
  26,16,"And go, both of you, unto Pharaoh and say, ‘Behold, we bear a message from the Sustainer of all the worlds"
  26,17,Let the children of Israel go with us!’”
  26,18,"[But when Moses had delivered his message, Pharaoh] said: “Did we not bring thee up among us when thou wert a child? And didst thou not spend among us years of thy [later] life"
  26,19,"And yet thou didst commit that [heinous] deed of thine, and [hast thus shown that] thou art one of the ingrate!”"
