quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,60,"and who give whatever they [have to] give with their hearts trembling at the thought that unto their Sustainer they must return"
  23,61,"it is they who vie with one another in doing good works, and it is they who outrun [all others] in attaining to them"
  23,62,"And [withal.] We do not burden any human being with more than he is well able to bear: for with Us is a record that speaks the truth [about what men do and can do]; and none shall be wronged"
  23,63,"NAY, [as for those who have torn asunder the unity of faith] - their hearts are lost in ignorance of all this! But apart from that [breach of unity] they have [on their conscience even worse] deeds; and they will [continue to] commit them"
  23,64,"until - after We shall have taken to task, through suffering, those from among them who [now] are lost in the pursuit of pleasures - they cry out in [belated] supplication"
  23,65,"[But they will be told:] “Cry not in supplication today: for, behold, you shall not he succoured by Us"
  23,66,"Time and again were My messages conveyed unto you, but [every time] you would turn about on your heels"
  23,67,"[and,] impelled by your arrogance, you would talk senselessly far into the night.”"
  23,68,"Have they, then, never tried to understand this word [of God]? Or has there [now] come to them something that never came to their forefathers of old"
  23,69,"Or is it, perchance, that they have not recognized their Apostle, and so they disavow him"
  23,70,"Or do they say. “There is madness in him”? Nay, he has brought them the truth - and the truth do most of them detest"
  23,71,"But if the truth were in accord with their own likes and dislikes, the heavens and the earth would surely have fallen into ruin, and all that lives in them [would long ago have perished]! Nay, [in this divine writ] We have conveyed unto them all that they ought to bear in mind: and from this their reminder they [heedlessly] turn away"
  23,72,"Or dost thou [O Muhammad] ask of them any worldly recompense? But [they ought to know that] recompense from thy Sustainer is best, since He is the best of providers"
  23,73,"And, verily, thou callest them onto a straight way –"
  23,74,"but, behold, those who will not believe in the life to come are bound to deviate from that way"
