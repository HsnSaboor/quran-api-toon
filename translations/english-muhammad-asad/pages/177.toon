quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,1,"THEY WILL ASK thee about the spoils of war. Say: \"All spoils of war belong to God and the Apostle.\" Remain, then, conscious of God, and keep alive the bonds of brotherhood among yourselves, and pay heed unto God and His Apostle, if you are [truly] believers"
  8,2,"Believers are only they whose hearts tremble with awe whenever God is mentioned, and whose faith is strengthened whenever His messages are conveyed unto them, and who in their Sustainer place their trust"
  8,3,those who are constant in prayer and spend on others out of what We provide for them as sustenance
  8,4,"it is they, they who are truly believers! Theirs shall be great dignity in their Sustainer's sight, and forgiveness of sins, and a most excellent sustenance"
  8,5,"EVEN AS thy Sustainer brought thee forth from thy home [to fight] in the cause of the truth, although some of the believers were averse to it"
  8,6,"[so, too,] they would argue with thee about the truth [itself] after it had become manifest - just as if they were being driven towards death and beheld it with their very eyes"
  8,7,"And, lo, God gave you the promise that one of the two [enemy] hosts would fall to you: and you would have liked to seize the less powerful one, whereas it was God's will to prove the truth to be true in accordance with His words, and to wipe out the last remnant of those who denied the truth"
  8,8,"so that He might prove the truth to be true and the false to be false, however hateful this might be to those who were lost in sin"
