quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,1,"A Surah [is this] which We have bestowed from on high, and which We have laid down in plain terms; and in it have We bestowed from on high messages which are clear [in themselves], so that you might keep [them] in mind"
  24,2,"AS FOR the adulteress and the adulterer flog each of them with a hundred stripes, and let not compassion with them keep you from [carrying out] this law of God, if you [truly] believe in God and the Last Day; and let a group of the believers witness their chastisement"
  24,3,"[Both are equally guilty:] the adulterer couples with none other than an adulteress - that is, a woman who accords [to her own lust] a place side by side with God; and with the adulteress couples none other than an adulterer - that is, a man who accords [to his own lust] a place side by side with God: and this is forbidden unto the believers"
  24,4,"And as for those who accuse chaste women [of adultery], and then are unable to produce four witnesses [in support of their accusation], flog them with eighty stripes and ever after refuse to accept from them any testimony - since it is they, they that are truly depraved"
  24,5,"excepting [from this interdict] only those who afterwards repent and made amends: for, behold, God is much forgiving, a dispenser of grace"
  24,6,"And as for those who accuse their own wives [of adultery], but have no witnesses except themselves, let each of these [accusers] call God four times to witness that he is indeed telling the truth"
  24,7,"and the fifth time, that God’s curse be upon him if he is telling a lie"
  24,8,"But [as for the wife, all] chastisement shall be averted from her by her calling God four times to witness that he is indeed telling a lie"
  24,9,"and the fifth [time], that God’s curse be upon her if he is telling the truth"
  24,10,"AND WERE it not for God’s favour upon you, [O man,] and His grace, and that God is a wise acceptor of repentance"
