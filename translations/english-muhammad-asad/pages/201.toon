  9,87,"They were well-pleased to remain with those who were left behind - where for their hearts have been sealed, so that they cannot grasp the truth"
  9,88,"The Apostle, however, and all who share his faith strive hard [in God's cause] with, their possessions and their lives: and it is they whom the most excellent things await [in the life to come], and it is they, they who shall attain to a happy state"
  9,89,"God has readied for them gardens through which running waters flow, therein to abide: and this is the triumph supreme"
  9,90,"AND THERE came [unto the Apostle] such of the bedouin as had some excuse to offer, [with the request] that they be granted exemption, whereas those who were bent on giving the lie to God and His Apostle [simply] remained at home. [And] grievous suffering is bound to befall such of them as are bent on denying the truth"
  9,91,"[But] no blame shall attach to the weak, nor to the sick, nor to those who have no means. [to equip themselves], provided that they are sincere towards God and His Apostle: there is no cause to reproach the doers of good, for God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace"
  9,92,"Nor [shall blame attach] to those who, when they came unto thee [O Prophet, with the request] that thou provide them with mounts, were told by thee, \"I cannot find anything whereon to mount you\" - [whereupon] they turned away, their eyes overflowing with tears out of sorrow that they had no means to spend [on their equipment]"
  9,93,"Only they may rightly be reproached who asked thee for exemption even though they were fully able [to go to war]. They were well-pleased to remain with those who were left behind -wherefore God has sealed their hearts, so that they do not know [what they are doing]"
