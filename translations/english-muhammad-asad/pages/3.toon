  2,7,"God; has sealed their hearts and their hearing, and over their eyes is a veil; and awesome suffering awaits them"
  2,8,"And there are people who say, \"We do believe in God and the Last Day,\" the while they do not [really] believe"
  2,9,"They would deceive God and those who have attained to faith-the while they deceive none but themselves, and perceive it not"

  2,12,"Oh, verily, it is they, they who are spreading corruption but they perceive it not"
  2,13,"And when they are told, \"Believe as other people believe,\" they answer, \"Shall we believe as the weak-minded believe?\" Oh, verily, it is they, they who are weak-minded -but they know it not"
  2,14,"And when they meet those who have attained to faith, they assert, \"We believe [as you believe]\"; but when they find themselves alone with their- evil impulses, they say, \"Verily, we are with you; we were only mocking"
