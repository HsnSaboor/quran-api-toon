  37,103,"But as soon as the two had surrendered themselves to [what they thought to be] the will of God, and [Abraham] had laid him down on his face"
  37,104,"We called out to him: “O Abraham"
  37,105,"thou hast already fulfilled [the purpose of] that dream- vision!” Thus, verily, do We reward the doers of good"
  37,106,"for, behold, all this was indeed a trial, clear in itself"
  37,107,And We ransomed him with a tremendous sacrifice
  37,108,and left him thus to be remembered among later generations
  37,109,“Peace be upon Abraham!”
  37,110,Thus do We reward the doers of good –
  37,111,for he was truly one of our believing servants
  37,112,"And [in time] We gave him the glad tiding of Isaac, [who, too, would be] a prophet, one of the righteous"

  37,117,"And We gave them the divine writ that made [right and wrong] distinct"
  37,118,and guided them the straight way
  37,119,and left them thus to be remembered among later generations
  37,120,“Peace be upon Moses and Aaron!”
  37,121,Thus do We reward the doers of good –
  37,122,for those two were truly among Our believing servants
  37,123,"AND, BEHOLD, Elijah [too] was indeed one of Our message-bearers"

  37,125,"Will you invoke Baal and forsake [God,] the best of artisans"
  37,126,"God, your Sustainer and the Sustainer of your forebears of old?”"
