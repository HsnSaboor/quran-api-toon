quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,48,"Indeed, even before this time have they tried to stir up discord and devised all manner of plots against thee, [O Prophet,] until the truth was revealed and God's will became manifest, however hateful this may have been to them"
  9,49,"And among them there was [many a one] who said,\" Grant me permission [to remain at home], and do not put me to too hard a test!\" Oh, verily, [by making such a request] they had [already failed in their test and] succumbed to a temptation to evil: and, behold, hell will indeed encompass all who refuse to acknowledge the truth"
  9,50,"Should good fortune alight on thee, [O Prophet,] it will grieve them; and should misfortune befall thee, they will say [to themselves], \"We have already taken our precautions beforehand!\" - and will turn away, and will rejoice"
  9,51,"Say: \"Never can anything befall us save what God has decreed! He is our Lord Supreme; and in God let the believers place their trust"
  9,52,"Say: \"Are you, perchance, hopefully waiting for something [bad] to happen to us-[the while nothing can happen to us] save one of the two best things? But as far as you are concerned, we are hopefully waiting for God to inflict chastisement upon you, [either] from Himself or by our hands! Wait, then, hopefully; behold, we shall hopefully wait with you"
  9,53,"Say: \"You may spend [anything], willingly-or unwillingly, [pretending that you do it for the sake of God:] it shall never be accepted from you -for, verily, you are people bent on iniquity"
  9,54,"For, only this prevents their spending from being accepted from them: they are bent on refusing to acknowledge God and His Apostle, and never pray without reluctance, and never spend [on righteous causes] without resentment"
