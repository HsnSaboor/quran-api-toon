  16,94,"And do not use your oaths as a means of deceiving one another-or else [your] foot will slip after having been firm, and then you will have to taste the evil [consequences] of your having turned away from the path of God, with tremendous suffering awaiting you [in the life to come]"

  16,98,"NOW whenever thou happen to read this Qur'an, seek refuge with God from Satan, the accursed"
  16,99,"Behold, he has no power over those who have attained to faith and in their Sustainer place their tray trust"

  16,102,"Say: \"Holy inspiration has brought it down from thy Sustainer by stages, setting forth the truth, so that it might give firmness unto those who have attained to faith, and provide guidance and a glad tiding unto all who have surrendered themselves to God"
