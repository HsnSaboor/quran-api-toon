quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  23,105,"[And God will say:] “Were not My messages conveyed unto you, and were you [not] wont to give them the lie?”"
  23,106,"They will exclaim: “O our Sustainer! Our bad luck has overwhelmed us, and so we went astray"
  23,107,"O our Sustainer! Cause us to come out of this [suffering] - and then, if ever We revert [to sinning], may we truly be [deemed] evildoers!”"
  23,108,"[But] He will say: “Away with you into this [ignominy]! And speak no more unto Me"
  23,109,"“Behold, there were among My servants such as would pray, ‘O our Sustainer! We have come to believe [in Thee]; forgive, then, our sins and bestow Thy mercy on us: for Thou art the truest bestower of mercy!’"
  23,110,but you made them a target of your derision to the point where it made you forget all remembrance of Me; and you went on and on laughing at them
  23,111,"[But,] behold, today I have rewarded them for their patience in adversity: verily, it is they, they who have achieved a triumph!”"
  23,112,"[And] He will ask [the doomed]: “What number of years have you spent on earth?”"
  23,113,"They will answer: ‘We have spent there a day, or part of a day; but ask those who [are able to] count [time] …”"
  23,114,"[Whereupon] He will say: “You have spent there but a short while: had you but known [how short it was to be]"
  23,115,"Did you, then, think that We created you in mere idle play, and that you would not have to return to Us?”"

  23,117,"Hence, he who invokes, side by side with God, any other deity [- a deity] for whose existence he has no evidence - shall but find his reckoning with his Sustainer: [and,] verily, such deniers of the truth will never attain to a happy state"
  23,118,"Hence, [O believer,] say: “O my Sustainer! Grant [me] forgiveness and bestow Thy mercy [upon me]: for Thou art the truest bestower of mercy!”"
