quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,44,"Or dost thou think that most of them listen [to thy message] and use their reason? Nay, they are but like cattle - nay, they are even less conscious of the right way"
  25,45,"Art thou not aware of thy Sustainer [through His works]? - how He causes the shadow to lengthen [towards the night] when, had He so willed, He could indeed have made it stand still: but then, We have made the sun its guide"
  25,46,"and then, [after having caused it to lengthen,] We draw it in towards Ourselves with a gradual drawing-in"
  25,47,"And He it is who makes the night a garment for you, and [your] sleep a rest, and causes every [new] day to be a resurrection"
  25,48,"And He it is who sends forth the winds as a glad tiding of His coming grace; and [thus, too,] We cause pure water to descend from the skies"
  25,49,"so that We may bring dead land to life thereby, and give to drink thereof to many [beings] of Our creation, beasts as well as humans"
  25,50,"And, indeed, many times have We repeated [all] this unto men, so that they might take it to heart: but most men refuse to be aught but ingrate"

  25,54,"And He it is who out of this [very] water has created man, and has endowed him with [the consciousness of] descent and marriage-tie: for thy Sustainer is ever infinite in His power"
  25,55,"And yet, some people worship, instead of God, things that can neither benefit them nor harm them: thus, he who denies the truth does indeed turn his back on his Sustainer"
