quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"But thus it is: if We send a wind [that scorches their land], and they see it turn yellow, they begin, after that [erstwhile joy], to deny the truth [of Our almightiness and grace]"
  30,52,"And, verily, thou canst not make the dead hear: and [so, too,] thou canst not make the deaf [of heart] hear this call when they turn their backs [on thee] and go away"
  30,53,"just as thou canst not lead the blind [of heart] out of their error: none canst thou make hear [thy call] save such as [are willing to] believe in Our messages, and thus surrender themselves unto Us"
  30,54,"IT IS GOD who creates you [all in a state of weakness, and then, after weakness, ordains strength [for you], and then, after [a period of] strength, ordains [old-age] weakness and grey hair. He creates what He wills; and He alone is all-knowing, infinite in His power"
  30,55,"[He it is who will cause you to die, and in time will resurrect you.] And when the Last Hour dawns, those who had been lost in sin will swear that they had not tarried [on earth] longer than an hour: thus were they wont to delude themselves [all their lives]"
  30,56,"But those who [in their lifetime] were endowed with knowledge and faith will say: “Indeed, you have been tardy in [accepting as true] what God has revealed, [and you have waited] until the Day of Resurrection: this, then, is the Day of Resurrection: but you - you were determined not to know it"
  30,57,"And so, on that Day their excuse will be of no avail to those who were bent on evildoing, nor will they be allowed to make amends"
  30,58,"AND, INDEED, We have propounded unto men all kinds of parables in this Qur’an. But thus it is: if thou approach them with any [such] message, those who are bent on denying the truth are sure to say, “You are but making false claims!”"
  30,59,"In this way does God seal the hearts of those who do not [want to] know [the truth]"
  30,60,"Remain, then, patient in adversity: verily, God's promise [of resurrection] is true indeed - so let not those who are devoid of all inner certainty disquiet thy mind"
