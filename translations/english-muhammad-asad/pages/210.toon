quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,15,"AND [thus it is:] whenever Our messages are conveyed unto them in all their clarity, those who do not believe that they are destined to meet Us [are wont to] say, \"Bring us a discourse other than this, or alter this one.” Say [O Prophet]: \"It is not conceivable that I should alter it of my own volition; I only follow what is revealed to me. Behold, I would dread, were I [thus] to rebel against my Sustainer, the suffering [which would befall me] on that awesome Day [of Judgment]"
  10,16,"Say: \"Had God willed it [otherwise], I would not have conveyed this [divine writ] unto you, nor would He have brought it to your knowledge. Indeed. a whole lifetime have I dwelt among you ere this [revelation came unto me]: will you not, then, use your reason?”"
  10,17,"And who could be more wicked than they who attribute their own lying inventions to God or give the lie to His messages? Verily, those who are lost in sin will never attain to a happy state"
  10,18,"and [neither will] they [who] worship, side by side with God, things or beings that can neither harm nor benefit them, saying [to themselves], \"These are our intercessors with God!\" Say: \"Do you [think that you could] inform God of anything in the heavens or on earth that He does not know? Limitless is He in His glory, and sublimely exalted above anything to which men may ascribe a share in His divinity"
  10,19,"AND [know that] all mankind were once but one single community, and only later did they begin to hold divergent views. And had it not been for a decree- that had already gone forth from thy Sustainer, all their differences would indeed have been settled [from the outset]"
  10,20,"NOW THEY [who deny the truth] are wont to ask, \"Why has no miraculous sign ever been bestowed upon him from on high by his Sustainer?\" Say, then: \"God's alone is the knowledge of that which. is beyond the reach of human perception. Wait, then, [until His will becomes manifest:] verily, I shall wait with you"
