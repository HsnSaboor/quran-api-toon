quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  18,98,"Said [the King]: \"This is a mercy from my Sustainer! Yet when the time appointed by my Sustainer shall come, He will make this [rampart] level with the ground: and my Sustainer's promise always comes true"
  18,99,"AND ON that Day\" We shall [call forth all mankind and] leave them to surge like waves [that dash] against one another; and the trumpet [of judgment] will be blown, and We shall gather them all together"
  18,100,"And on that Day We shall place hell, for all to see, before those who denied the truth"
  18,101,"those whose eyes had been veiled against any remembrance of Me because they could not bear to listen [to the voice of truth]"
  18,102,"Do they who are bent on denying the truth think, perchance, that they could take [any of] My creatures for protectors against Me? Verily, We have readied hell to welcome all who [thus] deny the truth"
  18,103,"Say: \"Shall we tell you who are the greatest losers in whatever they may do"
  18,104,"[It is] they whose labour has gone astray in [the pursuit of no more than] this world's life, and who none the less think that they are doing good works"
  18,105,"it is they who have chosen to deny their Sustainer's messages and the truth; that they are deseined to meet Him.\" Hence, all their [good] deeds come to nought, and no weight shall We assign to them on Resurrection Day"
  18,106,"That will be their recompense - [their] hell -for having denied the truth and made My messages and My apostles a target of their mockery"
  18,107,"[But,] verily, as for those who attain to faith and do righteous deeds - the gardens of paradise will be there to welcome them"
  18,108,"therein will they abide, [and] never will they desire any change therefrom"
  18,109,"SAY: \"If all the sea were ink for my Sustainer's words, the sea would indeed be exhausted ere my Sustainer's words are exhausted! And [thus it would be] if we were to add to it sea upon sea"
  18,110,"Say [O Prophet]: \"I am but a mortal man like all of you. It has been revealed unto me that your God is the One and Only God. Hence, whoever looks forward [with hope and awe] to meeting his Sustainer [on Judgment Day], let him do righteous deeds, and let him not ascribe unto anyone or anything a share in the worship due to his Sustainer"
