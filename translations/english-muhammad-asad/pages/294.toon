  18,6,"But wouldst thou, perhaps, torment thyself to death with grief over them if they are not willing to believe in this message"
  18,7,"Behold, We have willed that all beauty on earth be a means by which We put men to a test, [showing] which of them are best in conduct"
  18,8,"and, verily, [in time] We shall reduce all that is on it to barren dust"
  18,9,"AND SINCE the life of this world is but a test, dost thou [really] think that [the parable of] the Men of the Cave and of [their devotion to] the scriptures could be deemed more wondrous than any [other] of Our messages"
  18,10,"When those youths took refuge in the cave, they prayed: \"O our Sustainer! Bestow on us grace from Thyself, and endow us, whatever our [outward] condition, with consciousness of what is right"
  18,11,And thereupon We veiled their ears in the cave for many a year
  18,12,"and then We awakened them [and We did all this] so that We might mark out [to the world] which of the two points of view showed a better comprehension of the time-span during which they had remained in this state"

  18,14,"and endowed their hearts with strength, so that they stood up and said [to one another]: \"Our Sustainer is the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth. Never shall we invoke any deity other than Him: [if we did,] we should indeed have uttered an enormity"
  18,15,"These people of ours have taken to worshipping [other] deities instead of Him, without being able to adduce any reasonable evidence in support of their beliefs; and who could be more wicked than he who invents a lie about God"
