quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  7,164,"And whenever some people among them asked [those who tried to restrain the Sabbath-breakers], \"Why do you preach to people whom God is about to destroy or [at least] to chastise with suffering severe?\" -the pious ones would answer, \"In order to be free from blame before your Sustainer, and that these [transgressors, too,] might become conscious of Him"
  7,165,"And thereupon, when those [sinners] had forgotten all that they had been told to take to. heart, We saved those who had tried to prevent the doing of evil, and overwhelmed those who had been bent on evildoing with dreadful suffering for all their iniquity"
  7,166,"and then, when they disdainfully persisted in doing what they had been forbidden to do, We said unto them: \"Be as apes despicable"

  7,168,"And We dispersed them as [separate] communities all over the earth; some of them were righteous, and some of them less than that: and the latter We tried with blessings as well as with afflictions, so that they might mend their ways"
  7,169,"And they have been succeeded by [new] generations who - [in spite of] having inherited the divine writ-clutch but at the fleeting good of this lower world and say, \"We shall be forgiven, the while they are ready, if another such fleeting good should come their way, to clutch at it [and sin again].

Since the life in the hereafter is the better [of the two] for all who are conscious of God -will you not, then, use your reason"
  7,170,"For [We shall requite] all those who hold fast to the divine writ and are constant in prayer: verily, We shall not fail to requite those who enjoin the doing of what is right"
