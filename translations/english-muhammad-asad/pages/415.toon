  32,3,"and yet, they [who are bent on denying the truth] assert, “[Muhammad] has invented it!” Nay, but it is the truth from thy Sustainer, enabling thee to warn [this] people to whom no warner has come before thee, so that they might follow the right path"
  32,4,"IT IS GOD who has created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six aeons, and is established on the throne of His almightiness. You have none to protect you from God, and none to intercede for you [on Judgment Day]: will you not, then, bethink yourselves"

  32,10,"For, [many are] they [who] say, “What! After we have been [dead and] lost in the earth, shall we indeed be [restored to life] in a new act of creation?” Nay, but [by saying this] they deny the truth that they are destined to meet their Sustainer"
  32,11,"Say: “[One day,] the angel of death who has been given charge of you will gather you, and then unto your Sustainer you will be brought back.”"
