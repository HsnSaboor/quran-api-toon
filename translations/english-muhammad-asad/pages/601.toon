quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,CONSIDER the flight of time
  103,2,"Verily, man is bound to lose himself"
  103,3,"unless he be of those who attain to faith, and do good works, and enjoin upon one another the keeping to truth, and enjoin upon one another patience in adversity"
  104,1,"WOE unto every slanderer, fault-finder"
  104,2,Woe unto him who amasses wealth and counts it a safeguard
  104,3,thinking that his wealth will make him live forever
  104,4,"Nay, but [in the life to come such as] he shall indeed be abandoned to crushing torment"
  104,5,And what could make thee conceive what that crushing torment will be
  104,6,A fire kindled by God
  104,7,"which will rise over the [guilty] hearts"
  104,8,"verily, it will close in upon them"
  104,9,in endless columns
  105,1,ART THOU NOT aware of how thy Sustainer dealt with the Army of the Elephant
  105,2,Did He not utterly confound their artful planning
  105,3,"Thus, He let loose upon them great swarms of flying creatures"
  105,4,which smote them with stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained
  105,5,and caused them to become like a field of grain that has been eaten down to stubble
