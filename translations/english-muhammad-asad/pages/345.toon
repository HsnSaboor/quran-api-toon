  23,45,"AND THEN We sent forth Moses and his brother Aaron with Our messages and a manifest authority [from Us]"
  23,46,"unto Pharaoh and his great ones; but these behaved with arrogance, for they were people wont to glorify [only] themselves"
  23,47,"And so they said: “Shall we believe [them] two mortals like ourselves - although their people are our slaves?”"
  23,48,"Thus, they gave the lie to those two, and earned (thereby) their place among the doomed"
  23,49,"for, indeed, We had vouchsafed revelation unto Moses in order that they might find the right way"

  23,55,Do they think that by all the wealth and offspring with which We provide them
  23,56,"We [but want to] make them vie with one another in doing [what they consider] good works? Nay, but they do not perceive [their error]"
