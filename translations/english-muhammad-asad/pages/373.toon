quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,137,"This [religion of ours] is none other than that to which our forebears clung"
  26,138,"and we are not going to be chastised [for adhering to it]!”"
  26,139,"And so they gave him the lie: and thereupon We destroyed them. In this [story], behold, there is a message [unto men], even though most of them will not believe [in it]"
  26,140,"But, verily, thy Sustainer - He alone - is almighty, a dispenser of grace"
  26,141,"[AND the tribe of] Thamud gave the lie to [one of God’s] message-hearers"
  26,142,"when their brother Salih said unto them: “Will you not be conscious of God"
  26,143,"Behold, I am an apostle [sent by Him] to you, [and therefore] worthy of your trust"
  26,144,"be, then, conscious of God, and pay heed unto me"
  26,145,"“And no reward whatever do I ask of you for it: my reward rests with none but the Sustainer of all the worlds"
  26,146,"“Do you think that you will be left secure [forever] in the midst of what you have here and now"
  26,147,"amidst [these] gardens and springs"
  26,148,"and fields, and [these] palm-trees with slender spathes? –"
  26,149,"and that you will [always be able to] hew dwellings out of the mountains with [the same] great skill?”"
  26,150,"“Be, then, conscious of God, and pay heed unto me"
  26,151,and pay no heed to the counsel of those who are given to excesses –
  26,152,those who spread corruption on earth instead of setting things to rights!”
  26,153,"Said they: “Thou art but one of the bewitched"
  26,154,"Thou art nothing but a mortal like ourselves! Come, then, forward with a token [of thy mission] if thou art a man of truth!”"
  26,155,"Replied he: “This she-camel shall have a share of water, and you shall have a share of water, on the days appointed [therefor]"
  26,156,"and do her no harm, lest suffering befall you on an awesome day!”"
  26,157,But they cruelly slaughtered her - and then they had cause to regret it
  26,158,"for the suffering [predicted by Salih,] befell them [then and there]. In this [story], behold, there is a message [unto men], even though most of them will not believe [in it]"
  26,159,"But, verily, thy Sustainer - He alone – is almighty, a dispenser of grace"
