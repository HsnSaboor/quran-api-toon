quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  16,43,"AND [even] before thy time, [O Muhammad,] We never sent [as Our apostles] any but [mortal] men, whom We inspired: and if you have not [yet] realized this, ask the followers of [earlier] revelation"
  16,44,"[and they will tell you that their prophets, too, were but mortal men whom We had endowed] with all evidence of the truth and with books of divine wisdom. And upon thee [too] have We bestowed from on high this reminder, so that thou might make clear unto mankind all that has ever been thus bestowed upon them, and that they might take thought"
  16,45,"Can, then, they who devise evil schemes ever feel sure that God will not cause the earth to swallow them, or that suffering will not befall them without their perceiving whence [it came]"
  16,46,"or that He will not take them to task [suddenly] in the midst of their comings and goings, without their being able to elude [Him]"
  16,47,"or take them to task through slow decay? And yet, behold, your Sustainer is most compassionate, a dispenser of grace"
  16,48,"HAVE, THEN, they [who deny the truth] never considered any of the things that God has created _ (how] their shadows turn right and left, prostrating themselves before God and utterly submissive [to His will]"
  16,49,"For, before God prostrates itself all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth - every beast that moves, and the angels: [even] these do not bear themselves with false pride"
  16,50,"they fear their Sustainer high above them, and do whatever they are bidden to do"
  16,51,"And God has said: \"Do not take to worshipping two [or more] deities. He is the One and Only God: hence, of Me, of Me alone stand in awe"
  16,52,"And His is all that is in the heavens and on earth, and to Him [alone] obedience is always due: will you, then, pay reverence to aught but Him"
  16,53,"For, whatever good thing comes to you, comes from God; and whenever harm befalls you, it is unto Him that you cry for help"
  16,54,"yet as soon as He has removed the harm from you, lo! some of you [begin to] ascribe to other powers a share 'in their Sustainer's divinity"
