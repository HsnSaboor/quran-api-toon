quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  36,55,"“Behold, those who are destined for paradise shall today have joy in whatever they do"
  36,56,in happiness will they and their spouses on couches recline
  36,57,"[only] delight will there be for them, and theirs shall be all that they could ask for"
  36,58,peace and fulfillment through the word of a Sustainer who dispenses all grace
  36,59,"“But stand aside today, O you who were lost in sin"
  36,60,"Did I not enjoin on you, O you children of Adam, that you should not worship Satan – since, verily, he is your open foe"
  36,61,"and that you should worship Me [alone]? This would have been a straight way"
  36,62,"And [as for Satan -] he had already led astray a great many of you: could you not, then, use your reason"
  36,63,"“This, then, is the hell of which you were warned again and again"
  36,64,endure it today as an outcome of your persistent denial of the truth!”
  36,65,"On that Day We shall set a seal on their mouths but their hands will speak unto Us, and their feet will bear witness to whatever they have earned [in life]"
  36,66,"NOW HAD IT BEEN Our will [that men should not be able to discern between right and wrong], We could surely have deprived them of their sight, so that they would stray forever from the [right] way: for how could they have had insight [into what is true]"
  36,67,"And had it been Our will [that they should not be free to choose between right and wrong], We could surely have given them a different nature [and created them as beings rooted] in their places, so that they would not be able to move forward, and could not turn back"
  36,68,"But [let them always remember that] if We lengthen a human being’s days, We also cause him to decline in his powers [when he grows old]: will they not, then, use their reason"
  36,69,"AND [thus it is:] We have not imparted to this [Prophet the gift of] poetry, nor would [poetry] have suited this [message]: it is but a reminder and a [divine] discourse, clear in itself and clearly showing the truth"
  36,70,"to the end that it may warn everyone who is alive [of heart], and that the word [of God] may bear witness against all who deny the truth"
