quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"Say: \"Can any of those beings to whom you ascribe a share in God's divinity create [life] in the first instance, and then bring it forth anew?” Say: \"It is God [alone] who creates [all life] in the first instance, and then brings it forth anew. How perverted, then, are your minds"
  10,35,"Say: \"Does any of those beings to whom you ascribe a share in God's divinity guide unto the truth?\" Say: \"It is God [alone] who guides unto the truth. Which, then, is more worthy to be followed - He who guides unto the truth, or he who cannot find the right way unless he is guided? What, then, is amiss with you and your judgment"
  10,36,"For, most of them follow nothing but conjecture: [and,] behold, conjecture can never be a substitute for truth. Verily, God has full knowledge of all that they do"
  10,37,"Now this Qur'an could not possibly have been devised by anyone save God: nay indeed, it confirms the truth of whatever there still remains [of earlier revelations] and clearly spells out the revelation [which comes] -let there be no doubt about it-from the Sustainer of all the worlds"
  10,38,"And yet, they [who are bent on denying the truth] assert, \"[Muhammad] has invented it!\" Say [unto them]: \"Produce, then, a surah of similar merit; and [to this end] call to your aid whomever you can, other than God, if what you say is true"
  10,39,"Nay, but they are bent on giving the lie to everything the wisdom whereof they do not comprehend, and ere its inner meaning has become clear to them Even thus did those who lived before their time give the lie to the truth: and behold what happened in the end to those evildoers"
  10,40,"And there are among them such as will in time come to believe in this [divine writ], just as there are among them such as will never believe in it; and thy Sustainer is fully aware as to who are the spreaders of corruption"
  10,41,"And [so, O Prophet,] if they give thee the lie, say: \"To me [shall be accounted] my doings, and to you, your doings: you are not accountable for what I am doing, and I am not accountable for whatever you do"
  10,42,"And there are among them such as (pretend to] listen to thee: but canst thou cause the deaf to hearken even though they will not use their reason"
