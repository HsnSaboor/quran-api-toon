  26,42,"Answered he: “Yea - and, verily, in that case you shall be among those who are near unto me"
  26,43,"[And] Moses said unto them: “Throw whatever you are going to throw!”"
  26,44,"Thereupon they threw their [magic ropes and their staffs, and said: “By Pharaoh’s might, behold, it is we indeed who have prevailed!”]"
  26,45,"[But] then Moses threw his staff - and lo! it swallowed up all their deceptions"

  26,58,"and [deprived them of their erstwhile] station of honour!”"
