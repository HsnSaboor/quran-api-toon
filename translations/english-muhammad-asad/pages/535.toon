quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,Immortal youths will wait upon them
  56,18,"with goblets, and ewers, and cups filled with water from unsullied springs"
  56,19,by which their minds will not be clouded and which will not make them drunk
  56,20,and with fruit of any kind that they may choose
  56,21,and with the flesh of any fowl that they may desire
  56,22,"And [with them will be their] companions pure, most beautiful of eye"
  56,23,"like unto pearls [still] hidden in their shells"
  56,24,"[And this will be] a reward for what they did [in life]"
  56,25,"No empty talk will they hear there, nor any call to sin"
  56,26,but only the tiding of inner soundness and peace
  56,27,NOW AS FOR those who have attained to righteousness - what of those who have attained to righteousness
  56,28,"[They, too, will find themselves] amidst fruit- laden lote-trees"
  56,29,and acacias flower-clad
  56,30,and shade extended
  56,31,and waters gushing
  56,32,and fruit abounding
  56,33,never-failing and never out of reach
  56,34,"And [with them will be their] spouses, raised high"
  56,35,"for, behold, We shall have brought them into being in a life renewed"
  56,36,having resurrected them as virgins
  56,37,"full of love, well-matched"
  56,38,with those who have attained to righteousness
  56,39,a good many of olden times
  56,40,and a good many of later times
  56,41,BUT AS FOR those who have persevered in evil - what of those who have persevered in evil
  56,42,"[They will find themselves] in the midst of scorching winds, and burning despair"
  56,43,and the shadows of black smoke
  56,44,"[shadows] neither cooling nor soothing"
  56,45,"For, behold, in times gone by they were wont to abandon themselves wholly to the pursuit of pleasures"
  56,46,and would persist in heinous sinning
  56,47,"and would say, “What! After we have died and become mere dust and bones, shall we, forsooth, be raised from the dead"
  56,48,"and perhaps, too, our forebears of old?”"
  56,49,"Say: “Verily, those of olden times and those of later times"
  56,50,"will indeed be gathered together at an appointed time on a Day known [only to God]"
