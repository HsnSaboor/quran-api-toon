  72,1,"SAY: \"It has been revealed to me that some of the unseen beings gave ear [to this divine writ], and thereupon said [unto their fellow-beings]: \"'Verily, we have heard a wondrous discourse"
  72,2,guiding towards consciousness of what is right; and so We have come to believe in it. And we shall never ascribe divinity to anyone beside our Sustainer
  72,3,"for [we know] that sublimely exalted is our Sustainer's majesty: no consort has He ever taken unto Himself, nor a son"
  72,4,"And [now we know] that the foolish among us were wont to say outrageous things about God"
  72,5,"and that [we were mistaken when] we thought that neither man nor [any of] the invisible forces would ever tell a lie about God"
  72,6,"Yet [it has always happened] that certain kinds of humans would seek refuge with certain kinds of [such] invisible forces: but these only increased their confusion –"
  72,7,"so much so that they came to think, as you [once] thought, that God would never [again] send forth anyone [as His apostle]"
  72,8,"And [so it happened] that we reached out towards heaven: but we found it filled with mighty guards and flames"
  72,9,"notwithstanding that we were established in positions [which we had thought well-suited] to listening to [whatever secrets might be in] it: and anyone who now [or ever] tries to listen will [likewise] find a flame lying in wait for him"

  72,11,"Just as [we do not know how it happens] that some from among us are righteous, while some of us are [far] below that: we have always followed widely divergent paths"
  72,12,"And, withal, we have come to know that we can never elude God [while we live] on earth, and that we can never elude Him by escaping [from life]"
  72,13,"Hence, as soon as we heard this [call to His] guidance, we came to believe in it: and he who believes in his Sustainer need never have fear of loss or injustice"
