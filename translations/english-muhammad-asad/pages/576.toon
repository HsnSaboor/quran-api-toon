quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,"Behold, [when Our messages are conveyed to one who is bent on denying the truth,] he reflects and meditates [as to how to disprove them] –"
  74,19,"and thus he destroys himself, the way he meditates"
  74,20,"yea, he destroys himself, the way he meditates"
  74,21,"and then he looks [around for new arguments]"
  74,22,and then he frowns and glares
  74,23,"and in the end he turns his back [on Our message], and glories in his arrogance"
  74,24,"and says, \"All this is mere spellbinding eloquence handed down [from olden times]"
  74,25,This is nothing but the word of mortal man
  74,26,"[Hence,] I shall cause him to endure hell-fire [in the life to come]"
  74,27,And what could make thee conceive what hell-fire is
  74,28,"It does not allow to live, and neither leaves [to die]"
  74,29,"making [all truth] visible to mortal man"
  74,30,"Over it are nineteen [powers]"
  74,31,"For We have caused none but angelic powers to lord over the fire [of hell]; and We have not caused their number to be aught but a trial for those who are bent on denying the truth - to the end that they who have been granted revelation aforetime might be convinced [of the truth of this divine writ]; and that they who have attained to faith [in it] might grow yet more firm in their faith; and that [both] they who have been granted the earlier revelation and they who believe [in this one] might be freed of all doubt; and that they in whose hearts is disease and the who deny the truth outright might ask, \"What does [your] God mean by this parable?\" In this way God lets go astray him that wills [to go astray], and guides aright him that wills [to be guided]. And none can comprehend thy Sustainers forces save Him alone: and all this is but a reminder to mortal man"
  74,32,"NAY, but consider the moon"
  74,33,Consider the night when it departs
  74,34,and the morn when it dawns
  74,35,"Verily, that [hell-fire) is Indeed one of the great [forewarnings] –"
  74,36,a warning to mortal man –
  74,37,"to everyone of you, whether he chooses to come forward or to hang back"
  74,38,"[On the Day of Judgment,] every human being will be held in pledge for whatever [evil] he has wrought –"
  74,39,save those who shall have attained to righteousness
  74,40,"[dwelling] In gardens [of paradise], they will inquire"
  74,41,of those who were lost in sin
  74,42,What has brought you into hell-fire
  74,43,"They will answer: \"We were not among those who prayed"
  74,44,and neither did we feed the needy
  74,45,"and we were wont to indulge in sinning together with all [the others] who indulged in it"
  74,46,and the Day of Judgment we were wont to call a lie –
  74,47,"until certainty came upon us [in death]"
