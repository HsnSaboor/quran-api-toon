  83,35,"[for, resting in paradise] on couches, they will look on [and say to themselves]"
  83,36,"Are these deniers of the truth being [thus] requited for [aught but] what they were wont to do"
  84,1,WHEN THE SKY is split asunder
  84,2,"obeying its Sustainer, as in truth it must"
  84,3,and when the earth is leveled
  84,4,"and casts forth whatever is in it, and becomes utterly void"
  84,5,"obeying its Sustainer, as in truth it must"
  84,6,"[then,] O man - thou [that] hast, verily, been toiling towards thy Sustainer in painful toil - then shalt thou meet Him"
  84,7,And as for him whose record shall be placed in his right hand
  84,8,he will in time be called to account with an easy accounting
  84,9,"and will [be able to] turn joyfully to those of his own kind"
  84,10,But as for him whose record shall be given to him behind his back
  84,11,he will in time pray for utter destruction
  84,12,but he will enter the blazing flame
  84,13,"Behold, [in his earthly life] he lived joyfully among people of his own kind"
  84,14,"for, behold, he never thought that he would have to return [to God]"

  84,16,"BUT NAY! I call to witness the sunset's [fleeting] afterglow"
  84,17,"and the night, and what it [step by step] unfolds"
  84,18,"and the moon, as it grows to its fullness"

  84,21,"and [that], when the Qur’an is read unto them, they do not fall down in prostration"
  84,22,"Nay, but they who are bent on denying the truth give the lie [to this divine writ]"
  84,23,"Yet God has full knowledge of what they conceal [in their hearts]"
  84,24,"Hence, give them the tiding of grievous suffering [in the life to come] –"
  84,25,"unless it be such [of them] as [repent, and] attain to faith, and do good works: for theirs shall be a reward unending"
