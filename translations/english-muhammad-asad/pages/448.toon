quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"who was wont to ask [me], ‘Why - art thou really one of those who believe it to be true"
  37,53,"[that] after we have died and become mere dust and bones we shall, forsooth, be brought to judgment?”’"
  37,54,"[And] he adds: “Would you like to look [and see him]?” –"
  37,55,"and then he looks and sees that [companion of his] in the midst of the blazing fire"
  37,56,"and says: “By God! Verily, thou hast almost destroyed me [too, O my erstwhile companion]"
  37,57,"for had it not been for my Sustainer’s favour, I would surely be [now] among those who are given over [to suffering]"
  37,58,"But then, [O my friends in paradise,] is it [really] so that we are not to die"
  37,59,"[again,] beyond our previous death, and that we shall never [again] be made to suffer"
  37,60,"Verily, this - this indeed - is the triumph supreme!”"
  37,61,"For the like of this, then, let them labour, those who labour [in God’s way]"
  37,62,"Is such [a paradise] the better welcome - or the [hellish] tree of deadly fruit"
  37,63,"Verily, We have caused it to be a trial for evildoers"
  37,64,"for, behold, it is a tree that grows in the very heart of the blazing fire [of hell]"
  37,65,"its fruit [as repulsive] as satans’ heads"
  37,66,"and they [who are lost in evil] are indeed bound to eat thereof, and to fill their bellies therewith"
  37,67,"And, behold, above all this they will be confounded with burning despair"
  37,68,"And once again: Verily, the blazing fire is their ultimate goal –"
  37,69,"for, behold, they found their forebears on a wrong way"
  37,70,"and [now] they make haste to follow in their footsteps"
  37,71,"Thus, indeed, most of the people of old went astray before them"
  37,72,"although, verily, We had sent warners unto them"
  37,73,"and behold what happened in the end to those that had been warned [to no avail]"
  37,74,"EXCEPT for God’s true servants, [most people are apt to go astray]"
  37,75,"And, indeed, [it was for this reason that] Noah cried unto Us - and how excellent was Our response"
  37,76,for We saved him and his household from that awesome calamity
