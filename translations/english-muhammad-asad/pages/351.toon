quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,11,"Verily, numerous among you are those who would falsely accuse others of unchastity: [but, O you who are thus wronged,] deem it not a bad thing for you: nay, it is good for you! [As for the slanderers,] unto every one of them [will be accounted] all that he has earned by [thus] sinning; and awesome suffering awaits any of them who takes it upon himself to enhance this [sin]"
  24,12,"Why do not the believing men and women, whenever such [a rumour] is heard, think the best of one another and say, “This is an obvious falsehood”"
  24,13,"why do they not [demand of the accusers that they] produce four witnesses to prove their allegation? for, if they do not produce such witnesses, it is those [accusers] who, in the sight of God, are liars indeed"
  24,14,"And were it not for God’s favour upon you, [O men,] and His grace in this world and in the life to come, awesome suffering would indeed have afflicted you in result of all [the calumny] in which you indulge"
  24,15,"when you take it up with your tongues, uttering with your mouths something of which you have no knowledge, and deeming it a light matter whereas in the sight of God it is an awful thing"
  24,16,"And [once again]: Why do you not say, whenever you hear such [a rumour], “It does not behove us to speak of this, O Thou who art limitless in Thy glory: this is an awesome calumny”"
  24,17,"God admonishes you [hereby] lest you ever revert to the like of this [sin], if you are [truly] believers"
  24,18,"for God makes [His] messages clear unto you - and God is all-knowing, Wise"
  24,19,"Verily, as for those who like [to hear] foul slander spread against [any of] those who have attained to faith grievous suffering awaits them in this world and in the life to come: for God knows [the full truth], whereas you know [it] not"
  24,20,"And were it not for God’s favour upon you and His grace, and that God is compassionate, a dispenser of grace"
