quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,16,"And thus have We bestowed from on high this [divine writ] in the shape of clear messages: for [thus it is] that God guides him who wills [to be guided]"
  22,17,"Verily, as for those who have attained to faith [in this divine writ], and those who follow the Jewish faith, and the Sabians, and the Christians, and the Magians, [on the one hand,] and those who are bent on ascribing divinity to aught but God, [on the other,] verily, God will decide between them on Resurrection Day: for, behold, God is witness unto everything"
  22,18,"ART THOU NOT aware that before God prostrate themselves all [things and beings] that are in the heavens and all that are on earth the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and the beasts? And many human beings [submit to God consciously], whereas many [others, having defied Him,] will inevitably have to suffer [in the life to come]; and he whom God shall scorn [on Resurrection Day] will have none who could bestow honour on him: for, verily, God does what He wills"
  22,19,"These two contrary kinds of man have become engrossed in contention about their Sustainer! But [thus it is:] as for those who are bent on denying the truth garments of fire shall be cut out for them [in the life to come]; burning despair will be poured over their heads"
  22,20,"causing all that is within their bodies, as well as the skins, to melt away"
  22,21,"And they shall be held [in this state as if] by iron grips"
  22,22,"and every time they try in their anguish to come out of it, they shall be returned thereto and [be told]: “Taste suffering through fire [to the full]!”"
  22,23,"[As against this,] behold, God will admit those who attain to faith and do righteous deeds into gardens through which running waters flow, wherein they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and where silk will be their raiment"
