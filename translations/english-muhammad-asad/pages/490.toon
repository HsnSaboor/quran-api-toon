quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  43,11,"And He it is who sends down, again and again, waters from the sky in due measure: and [as] We raise therewith dead land to life, even thus will you be brought forth [from the dead]"
  43,12,"And He it is who has created all opposites. And He [it is who] has provided for you all those ships and animals whereon you ride"
  43,13,"in order that you might gain mastery over them, and that, whenever you have mastered them, you might remember your Sustainer’s blessings and say: “Limitless in His glory is He who has made [all] this subservient to our use - since [but for Him,] we would not have been able to attain to it"
  43,14,"Hence, verily, it is unto Him that we must always turn.”"
  43,15,"AND YET, they attribute to Him offspring from among some of the beings created by Him! Verily, most obviously bereft of all gratitude is man"
  43,16,"Or [do you think], perchance, that out of all His creation He has chosen for Himself daughters, and favoured you with sons"
  43,17,"For [thus it is:] if any of them is given the glad tiding of [the birth of] what he so readily attributes to the Most Gracious, his face darkens, and he is filled with suppressed anger"
  43,18,"“What! [Am I to have a daughter -] one who is to be reared [only] for the sake of ornament?” and thereupon he finds himself torn by a vague inner conflict"
  43,19,"And [yet] they claim that the angels - who in themselves are but beings created by the Most Gracious - are females: [but] did they witness their creation? This false claim of theirs will be recorded, and they will be called to account [for it on Judgment Day]"
  43,20,"Yet they say, “Had [not] the Most Gracious so willed, we would never have worshipped them!” [But] they cannot have any knowledge of [His having willed] such a thing: they do nothing but guess"
  43,21,"Or have We, perchance, vouchsafed them, before this one, a revelation [to the contrary,] to which they are still holding fast"
  43,22,"Nay, but they say, “Behold, We found our forefathers agreed on what to believe - and, verily, it is in their footsteps that we find our guidance!”"
