quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,"And, O my people, no benefit do I ask of you for this [message]: my reward rests with none but God. And I shall not repulse [any of] those who have attained to faith. Verily, they [know that they] are destined to meet their Sustainer, whereas in you I see people without any awareness [of right and wrong]"
  11,30,"And, O my people, who would shield me from God were I to repulse them? Will you not, then, keep this in mind"
  11,31,"And I do not say unto you, `God's treasures are with me'; nor [do I say], `I know the reality which is beyond the reach of human perception'; nor do I say, 'Behold, I am an angel'; nor do I say of those whom your eyes hold in contempt, `Never will God grant them any good'- for God is fully aware of what is in their hearts. [Were I to speak thus,] verily, I would indeed be among the evildoers"
  11,32,"[But the great ones] said: \"O Noah! Thou hast contended with us in argument, and hast [needlessly] prolonged our controversy: bring upon us, therefore, that with which thou dost threaten us, if thou art a man of truth"
  11,33,"He answered: \"Only God can bring it upon you, if He so wills, and you shall not elude it"
  11,34,"for, my advice will not benefit you -much as I desire to give you good advice - if it be God's will that you shall remain lost in grievous error. He is your Sustainer, and unto Him you must return"
  11,35,"DO SOME, perchance, assert, \"[Muhammad] has invented this [story]\"? Say [O Prophet]: \"If I have invented it, upon me be this sin; but far be it from me to commit the sin of which you are guilty"
  11,36,"AND THIS was revealed unto Noah: \"Never will any of thy people believe except those who have already attained to faith. Be not, then, distressed by anything that they may do"
  11,37,"but build, under Our eyes and according to Our inspiration, the ark [that shall save thee and those who follow thee]; and do not appeal to Me in behalf of those who are bent on evildoing for, behold, they are destined to be drowned"
