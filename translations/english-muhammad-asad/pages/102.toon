  4,148,"God does not like any evil to be mentioned openly, unless it be by him who has been wronged (thereby) And God is indeed all-hearing, all-knowing"
  4,149,"whether you do good openly or in secret, or pardon others for evil [done unto you]: for, behold, God is indeed an absolver of sins, infinite in His power"
  4,150,"VERILY, those who deny God and His apostles by endeavouring to make a distinction between [belief in] God and [belief in] His apostles, and who say, \"We believe in the one but we deny the other,\" and want to pursue a path in-between"
  4,151,"it is they, they who are truly denying the truth: and for those who deny the truth We have readied shameful suffering"
  4,152,"But as for those who believe in God and His apostles and make no distinction between any of them - unto them, in time, will He grant their rewards [in full]. And God is indeed much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace"
  4,153,"THE FOLLOWERS of the Old Testament demand of thee [O Prophet] that thou cause a revelation to be sent down to them from heaven.

After that, they took to worshipping the [golden] calf - and this after all evidence of the truth had come unto them! None the less, We effaced this [sin of theirs], and vouchsafed unto Moses a clear proof [of the truth]"
  4,154,"raising Mount Sinai high above them in witness of their solemn pledge. And We said unto them, “Enter the gate humbly”; and We told them, \"Do not break the Sabbath-law\"; and We accepted from them a most solemn pledge"
