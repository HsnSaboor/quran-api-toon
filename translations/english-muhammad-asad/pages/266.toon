  15,72,"[But the angels spoke thus:] \"As thou livest, [O Lot, they will not listen to thee:] behold, in their delirium [of lust] they are but blindly stumbling to and fro"
  15,73,"And thereupon the blast [of Our punishment] overtook them at the time of sunrise"
  15,74,"and We turned those [sinful towns} upside down, and rained down upon them stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained"
  15,75,"Verily, in all this there are messages indeed for those who can read the signs"
  15,76,"for, behold, those [towns] stood by a road that still exists"
  15,77,"Verily, herein lies a message indeed for all who believe [in God]"
