quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  18,54,"THUS, INDEED, have We given in this Qur'an many facets to every kind of lesson [designed] for [the benefit of] mankind. However, man is, above all else, always given to contention"
  18,55,"for, what is there to keep people from attaining to faith now that guidance has come unto them, and from asking their Sustainer to forgive them their sins - unless it be [their wish] that the fate of the [sinful] people of ancient times should befall them [as well], or that the [ultimate] suffering should befall them in the hereafter"
  18,56,"But We send [Our] message-bearers only as heralds of glad tidings and as warners - whereas those who are bent on denying the truth contend [against them] with fallacious arguments, so as to render void the truth thereby, and to make My messages and warnings a target of their mockery"

  18,60,"AND LO! [In the course of his wanderings,] Moses said to his servant: \"I shall not give up until I reach the junction of the two seas, even if I [have to] spend untold years [in my quest]"
  18,61,"But when they reached the junction between the two [seas], they forgot all about their fish, and it took its way into the sea and disappeared from sight"
