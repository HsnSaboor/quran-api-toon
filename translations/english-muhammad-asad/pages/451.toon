quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"But they gave him the lie: and therefore they will most surely be arraigned [on Judgment Day]"
  37,128,"excepting only [those who were] God’s true servants"
  37,129,and him We left thus to be remembered among later generations
  37,130,“Peace be upon Elijah and his followers!”
  37,131,"Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good –"
  37,132,for he was truly one of Our believing servants
  37,133,"AND, BEHOLD, Lot was indeed one of Our message-bearers"
  37,134,"[and so,] when [We decreed the doom of his sinful town,] We saved him and his household"
  37,135,except an old woman who was among those that stayed behind
  37,136,and then We utterly destroyed the others
  37,137,"and, verily, [to this day] you pass by the remnants of their dwellings at morning-time"
  37,138,"and by night. Will you not, then, use your reason"
  37,139,"AND, BEHOLD, Jonah was indeed one of Our message-bearers"
  37,140,when he fled like a runaway slave onto a laden ship
  37,141,"And then they cast lots, and he was the one who lost"
  37,142,"[and they cast him into the sea,] whereupon the great fish swallowed him, for he had been blameworthy"
  37,143,"And had he not been of those who [even in the deep darkness of their distress are able to] extol God’s limitless glory"
  37,144,he would indeed have remained in its belly till the Day when all shall be raised from the dead
  37,145,"but We caused him to be cast forth on a desert shore, sick [at heart] as he was"
  37,146,"and caused a creeping plant to grow over him [out of the barren soil]"
  37,147,"And [then] We sent him [once again] to [his people,] a hundred thousand [souls] or more"
  37,148,"and [this time] they believed [in him] and so We allowed them to enjoy their life during the time allotted to them"
  37,149,"AND NOW ask them to enlighten thee: Has thy Sustainer daughters, whereas they would have [only] sons"
  37,150,"or is it that We have created the angels female, and they [who believe them to be divine] have witnessed [that act of creation]"
  37,151,"Oh, verily, it is out of their own [inclination to] falsehood that some people assert"
  37,152,"“God has begotten [a son]”; and, verily, they are lying [too, when they say]"
  37,153,“He has chosen daughters in preference to sons”
