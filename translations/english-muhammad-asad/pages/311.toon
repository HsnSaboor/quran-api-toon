quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"And hast thou ever considered [the kind of man] who is bent on denying the truth of Our messages and says, \"I will surely be given wealth and children"
  19,78,"Has he, perchance, attained to a realm which is beyond the reach of a created being's perception? or has he concluded a covenant with the Most Gracious"
  19,79,"Nay! We shall record what he says, and We shall lengthen the length of his suffering [in the hereafter]"
  19,80,"and divest him of all that he is [now] speaking of: for [on Judgment Day] he will appear before Us in a lonely state"
  19,81,"For [such as] these have taken to worshipping deities other than God, hoping that they would be a [source of] strength for them"
  19,82,"But nay! [On Judgment Day] these [very objects of adoration] will disavow the worship that was paid to them, and will turn against those [who had worshipped them]"
  19,83,"ART THOU NOT aware that We have let loose all [manner of] satanic forces upon those who deny the truth - [forces] that impel them [towards sin] with strong impulsion"
  19,84,"Hence, be not in haste [to call down God's punishment] upon them: for We but number the number of their days"
  19,85,"On the Day when We shall gather the Godconscious unto [Us,] the Most Gracious, as honoured guests"
  19,86,and drive those who were lost in sin unto hell as a thirsty herd is driven to a well –
  19,87,"[on that Day] none will have [the benefit of] intercession unless he has [in his lifetime] entered into a bond with the Most Gracious"
  19,88,"As it is, some assert, \"The Most Gracious has taken unto Himself a son"
  19,89,"Indeed, [by this assertion] you have brought forth something monstrous"
  19,90,"whereat the heavens might well-nigh be rent into fragments, and the earth be split asunder, and the mountains fall down in ruins"
  19,91,That men should ascribe a son to the Most Gracious
  19,92,although it is inconceivable that the Most Gracious should take unto Himself a son
  19,93,"Not one of all [the beings] that are in the heavens or on earth appears before the Most Gracious other than as a servant"
  19,94,"indeed, He has full cognizance of them, and has numbered them with [unfailing] numbering"
  19,95,and every one of them will appear before Him on Resurrection Day in a lonely state
