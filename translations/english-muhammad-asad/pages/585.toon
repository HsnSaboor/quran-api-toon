quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,HE FROWNED and turned away
  80,2,because the blind man approached him
  80,3,"Yet for all thou didst know, [O Muhammad,] he might perhaps have grown in purity"
  80,4,"or have been reminded [of the truth], and helped by this reminder"
  80,5,Now as for him who believes himself to be self-sufficient
  80,6,to him didst thou give thy whole attention
  80,7,although thou art not accountable for his failure to attain to purity
  80,8,but as for him who came unto thee full of eagerness
  80,9,"and in awe [of God]"
  80,10,him didst thou disregard
  80,11,"NAY, VERILY, these [messages] are but a reminder"
  80,12,"and so, whoever is willing may remember Him"
  80,13,"in [the light of His] revelations blest with dignity"
  80,14,lofty and pure
  80,15,"[borne] by the hands of messengers"
  80,16,noble and most virtuous
  80,17,"[But only too often] man destroys himself: how stubbornly does he deny the truth"
  80,18,"[Does man ever consider] out of what substance [God] creates him"
  80,19,"Out of a drop of sperm He creates him, and thereupon determines his nature"
  80,20,and then makes it easy for him to go through life
  80,21,and in the end He causes him to die and brings him to the grave
  80,22,"and then, if it be His will, He shall raise him again to life"
  80,23,"Nay, but [man] has never yet fulfilled what He has enjoined upon him"
  80,24,"Let man, then, consider [the sources of] his food"
  80,25,"[how it is] that We pour down water, pouring it down abundantly"
  80,26,"and then We cleave the earth [with new growth], cleaving it asunder"
  80,27,and thereupon We cause grain to grow out of it
  80,28,and vines and edible plants
  80,29,and olive trees and date-palms
  80,30,and gardens dense with foliage
  80,31,and fruits and herbage
  80,32,for you and for your animals to enjoy
  80,33,"AND SO, when the piercing call [of resurrection] is heard"
  80,34,"on a Day when everyone will [want to] flee from his brother"
  80,35,and from his mother and father
  80,36,and from his spouse and his children
  80,37,"on that Day, to every one of them will his own state be of sufficient concern"
  80,38,Some faces will on that Day be bright with happiness
  80,39,"laughing, rejoicing at glad tidings"
  80,40,And some faces will on that Day with dust be covered
  80,41,with darkness overspread
  80,42,"these, these will be the ones who denied the truth and were immersed in iniquity"
