quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  20,88,"But then, [so they told Moses, the Samaritan] had produced for them [out of the molten gold] the effigy of a calf, which made a lowing sound; and thereupon they said [to one another], \"This is your deity, and the deity of Moses-but he has forgotten [his past]"
  20,89,"Why-did they not see that [the thing] could not give them any response, and had no power to harm or to benefit them"
  20,90,"And, indeed, even before [the return of Moses] had Aaron said unto them: \"O my people! You are but being tempted to evil by this [idol] -for, behold, your [only] Sustainer is the Most Gracious! Follow me, then, and obey my bidding"
  20,91,"[But] they answered: \"By no means shall we cease to worship it until Moses comes back to us"
  20,92,"[And now that he had come back, Moses] said: \"O Aaron! What has prevented thee, when thou didst see that they had gone astray"
  20,93,"from [abandoning them and] following me? Hast thou, then, [deliberately] disobeyed my commandment"
  20,94,"Answered [Aaron]: \"O my mother's son! Seize me not by my beard, nor by my head! Behold, I was afraid lest [on thy return] thou say, 'Thou hast caused a split among the children of Israel, and hast paid no heed to my bidding"
  20,95,"Said [Moses]: \"What, then, didst thou have in view, O Samaritan"
  20,96,"He answered: \"I have gained insight into something which they were unable to see: and so I took hold of a handful of the Apostle's teachings and cast it away: for thus has my mind prompted me [to act]"
  20,97,"Said [Moses]; \"Begone, then! And, behold, it shall be thy lot to say throughout [thy] life, `Touch me not! But, verily, [in the life to come] thou shalt be faced with a destiny from which there will be no escape! And [now] look at this deity of thine to whose worship thou hast become so devoted: we shall most certainly burn it, and then scatter [whatever remains of] it far and wide over the sea"
  20,98,"Your only deity is God - He save whom there is no deity, [and whho] embraces all things within His knowledge"
