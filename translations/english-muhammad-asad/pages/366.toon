quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  25,68,"and who never invoke any [imaginary] deity side by side with God, and do not take any human beings life - [the life] which God has willed to be sacred - otherwise than in [the pursuit of] justice, and do not commit adultery. And [know that] he who commits aught thereof shall [not only] meet with a full requital"
  25,69,"[but] shall have his suffering doubled on Resurrection Day: for on that [Day] he shall abide in ignominy"
  25,70,"Excepted, however, shall be they who repent and attain to faith and do righteous deeds: for it is they whose [erstwhile] bad deeds God will transform into good ones - seeing that God is indeed much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace"
  25,71,"and seeing that he who repents and [thenceforth] does what is right has truly turned unto God by [this very act of] repentance"
  25,72,"And [know that true servants of God are only] those who never bear witness to what is false, and [who], whenever they pass by [people engaged in] frivolity, pass on with dignity"
  25,73,"and who, whenever they are reminded of their Sustainer’s messages, do not throw themselves upon them [as if] deaf and blind"
  25,74,"and who pray “O our Sustainer! Grant that our spouses and our offspring be a joy to our eyes, and cause us to be foremost among those who are conscious of Thee!”"
  25,75,"[Such as] these will be rewarded for all their patient endurance [in life] with a high station [in paradise], and will be met therein with a greeting of welcome and peace"
  25,76,"therein to abide: [and] how goodly an abode and [how high] a station"
  25,77,"SAY [unto those who believe]: “No weight or value would my Sustainer attach to you were it not for your faith [in Him]!” And say unto those who deny the truth:] “You have indeed given the lie [to God’s message], and in time this [sin] will cleave unto you!”"
