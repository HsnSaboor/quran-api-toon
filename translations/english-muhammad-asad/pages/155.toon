quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,38,"[And God] will say: \"Join those hosts of invisible beings and humans who have gone before you into the fire!\" [And] every time a host enters [the fire], it will curse its fellow-host -so much so that, when they all shall have passed into it, one after another, the last of them will speak [thus] of the first of them: \"O our Sustainer! It is they who have led us astray: give, them, therefore, double suffering through fire!\" He, will reply: \"Every one of you deserves double suffering -but you know it not"
  7,39,"And the first of them will say unto the last of them: \"So you were in no wise superior to us! Taste, then, this suffering for all [the evil] that you were wont to do"
  7,40,"VERILY, unto those who give the lie to Our messages and scorn them in their pride, the gates of heaven shall not be opened; and they shall not enter paradise any more than a twisted rope can pass through a needle's eye: for thus do We requite such as are lost in sin"
  7,41,"Hell will be their resting-place and their covering as well: for thus do We requite the evildoers"
  7,42,"But those who attain to faith and do righteous deeds - [and] We do not burden any human being with more than he is well able to bear - they are destined for paradise, therein to abide"
  7,43,"after We shall have removed whatever unworthy thoughts or feelings may have been [lingering] in their bosoms. Running waters will flow at their feet; and they will say: \"All praise is due to God, who has guided us unto this; for we would certainly not have found the right path unless God had guided us! Indeed, our Sustainer's apostles have told us the truth!\" And [a voice] will call out unto them: \"This is the paradise which you have inherited by virtue of your past deeds"
