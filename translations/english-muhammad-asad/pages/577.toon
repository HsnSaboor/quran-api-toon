  74,48,"And so, of no benefit to them could be the intercession of any that would intercede for them"
  74,49,"WHAT, THEN, is amiss with them that they turn away from all admonition"
  74,50,as though they were terrified asses
  74,51,fleeing from a lion
  74,52,"Yea, everyone of them claims that he [himself] ought to have been given revelations unfolded"
  74,53,"Nay, but they do not [believe in and, hence, do not] fear the life to come"
  74,54,"Nay, verily, this is an admonition –"
  74,55,and whoever wills may take it to heart
  74,56,"But they [who do not believe in the life to come] will not take it to heart unless God so wills: [for] He is the Fount of all God-consciousness, and the Fount of all forgiveness"
  75,1,NAY! I call to witness the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,But nay! I call to witness the accusing voice of man's own conscience
  75,3,"Does man think that We cannot [resurrect him and] bring his bones together again"
  75,4,"Yea indeed, We are able to make whole his very finger-tips"
  75,5,None the less man chooses to deny what lies ahead of him
  75,6,"asking [derisively], \"When is that Resurrection Day to be"

  75,8,and the moon is darkened
  75,9,and the sun and the moon are brought together
  75,10,"on that Day will man exclaim \"Whither to flee"
  75,11,"But nay: no refuge [for thee, O man]"
  75,12,"With thy Sustainer, on that Day, the journey's end will be"
  75,13,"Man will be apprised, on that Day, of what he has done and what he has left undone"
  75,14,"nay, but man shall against himself be an eye-witness"
  75,15,even though he may veil himself in excuses
  75,16,"MOVE NOT thy tongue in haste, [repeating the words of the revelation]"
  75,17,"for, behold, it is for Us to gather it [in thy heart,] and to cause it to be read [as it ought to be read]"
  75,18,"Thus, when We recite it, follow thou its wording [with all thy mind]"
  75,19,"and then, behold, it will be for Us to make its meaning clear"
