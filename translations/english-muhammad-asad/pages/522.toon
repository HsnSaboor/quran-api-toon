quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"Said [Abraham]: “And what [else] may you have in view, O you [heavenly] messengers?”"
  51,32,"They answered: “Behold, we have been sent unto a people lost in sin"
  51,33,to let loose upon them stone-hard blows of chastisement
  51,34,"marked out in thy Sustainer’s sight for [the punishment of] such as have wasted their own selves.”"
  51,35,"And in the course of time We brought out [of Lot ’s city] such [few] believers as were there"
  51,36,"for apart from one [single] house We did not find there any who had surrendered themselves to Us"
  51,37,"And so We left therein a message for those who fear the grievous suffering [which awaits all evildoers]"
  51,38,"AND IN [the story of Pharaoh and] Moses, too, [We left the same message: for] when We sent him unto Pharaoh with [Our] manifest authority"
  51,39,"and he turned away in [the pride of] his power and said, “A sorcerer [is this Moses], or a madman!” –"
  51,40,"We seized him and his hosts, and cast them all into the sea: and [none but Pharaoh] himself was to blame [for what happened]"
  51,41,"And [you have the same message] in [what happened to the tribe of] Ad, when We let loose against them that life-destroying wind"
  51,42,"which spared nothing of what it came upon, but caused [all of] it to become like bones dead and decayed"
  51,43,"And in [the story of the tribe of] Thamud, too, when they were told, “You shall enjoy your life for [but] a little while,”"
  51,44,"after they had turned with disdain from their Sustainer’s commandment - whereupon the thunderbolt of punishment overtook them while they were [helplessly] looking on"
  51,45,"for they were unable even to rise, and could not defend themselves"
  51,46,"And [thus, too, We destroyed] Noah’s people aforetime: for they were iniquitous folk"
  51,47,"AND IT IS We who have built the universe with [Our creative] power; and, verily, it is We who are steadily expanding it"
  51,48,And the earth have We spread out wide - and how well have We ordered it
  51,49,"And in everything have We created opposites, so that you might bear in mind [that God alone is One]"
  51,50,"And so, [O Muhammad, say unto them:] “Flee unto God [from all that is false and evil]! Verily, I am a plain warner to you from Him"
  51,51,"And do not ascribe divinity to aught side by side with God: verily, I am a plain warner to you from Him!”"
