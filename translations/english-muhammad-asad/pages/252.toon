quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  13,19,"CAN, THEN, he who knows that whatever has been bestowed from on high upon thee by thy Sustainer is the truth be deemed equal to one who is blind? Only they who are endowed with insight keep this in mind"
  13,20,they who are true to their bond with God and never break their covenant
  13,21,"and who keep together what God has bidden to be joined, and stand in awe of their Sustainer and fear the most evil reckoning [which awaits such as do not respond to Him]"
  13,22,"and who are patient in adversity out of a longing for their Sustainer's countenance, and are constant in prayer, and spend on others, secretly and openly, out of what We provide for them as sustenance, and [who] repel evil with good. It is these that shall find their fulfilment in the hereafter"
  13,23,"gardens of perpetual bliss, which they shall enter together with the righteous from among their parents, their spouses, and their offspring; and the angels will come unto them from every gate [and will say]"
  13,24,"Peace be upon you, because you have persevered!\" How excellent, then, this fulfilment in the hereafter"
  13,25,"But as for those who break their bond with God after it has been established [in their nature], and cut asunder what God has bidden to be joined, and spread corruption on earth -their due is rejection [by God], and theirs is a most evil fate [in the life to come]"
  13,26,"GOD GRANTS abundant sustenance, or gives it in scant measure, unto whomever He wills; and they [who are given abundance] rejoice in the life of this world - even though, as compared with the life to come, the life of this world is nought but -a fleeting pleasure"
  13,27,"NOW THOSE who are bent on denying the truth [of the Prophet's message] say, \"Why has no miraculous sign ever been bestowed upon him from on high by his Sustainer?\" Say: \"Behold, God lets go astray him who wills [to go astray], just as He guides unto Himself all who turn unto Him"
  13,28,"those who believe, and whose hearts find their rest in the remembrance of God - for, verily, in the remembrance of God [men's] hearts do find their rest"
