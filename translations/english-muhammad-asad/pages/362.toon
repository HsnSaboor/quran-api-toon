quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,21,"But those who do not believe that they are destined to meet Us are wont to say, “Why have no angels been sent down to us?” – or, “Why do we not see our Sustainer?” Indeed, they are far too proud of themselves, having rebelled [against God’s truth] with utter disdain"
  25,22,"[Yet] on that Day - the Day on which they shall see the angels there will be no glad tiding for those who were lost in sin; and they will exclaim, “By a forbidding ban [are we from God’s grace debarred]!” –"
  25,23,"for We shall have turned towards all the [supposedly good] deeds they ever wrought, and shall have transformed them into scattered dust –"
  25,24,"[whereas] on that same Day those who are destined for paradise will be graced with the best of abodes and the fairest place of repose"

  25,29,"Indeed, he led me astray from the remembrance [of God] after it had come unto me!” For [thus it is:] Satan is ever a betrayer of man"
  25,30,"AND [on that Day] the Apostle will say: “O my Sustainer! Behold, [some of] my people have come to regard this Qur’an as something [that ought to be] discarded!”"
  25,31,"For so it is that against every prophet We have set up enemies from among those who are lost in sin: yet none can guide and give succour as thy Sustainer does"
  25,32,"Now they who are bent on denying the truth are wont to ask. “Why has not the Qur’an been bestowed on him from on high in one single revelation?” [it has been revealed] in this manner so that We might strengthen thy heart thereby - for We have so arranged its component parts that they form one consistent whole"
