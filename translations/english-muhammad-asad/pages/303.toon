  18,84,"Behold, We established him securely on earth, and endowed him with [the knowledge of] the right means to achieve anything [that he might set out to achieve]"
  18,85,"and so he chose the right means [in whatever he did]"
  18,86,"[And he marched westwards] till, when he came to the setting of the sun, it appeared to him that it was setting in a dark, turbid sea; and nearby he found a people [given to every kind of wrongdoing]. We said: \"O thou Two-Horned One! Thou mayest either cause [them] to suffer or treat them with kindness"
  18,87,"He answered: \"As for him who does wrong [unto others] - him shall we, in time, cause to suffer; and thereupon he shall be referred to his Sustainer, and He will cause him to suffer with unnameable suffering"
  18,88,"But as for him who believes and does righteous deeds - he will have the ultimate good [of the life to come] as his reward; and [as for us,] we shall make binding on him [only] that which is easy to fulfill"
  18,89,"And once again he chose the right means [to achieve a right end]"
  18,90,"[And then he marched eastwards] till, when he came to the rising of the sun he found that it was rising on a people for whom We had provided no coverings against it"
  18,91,"thus [We had made them, and thus he left them; and We did encompass with Our knowledge all that he had in mind]"
  18,92,And once again he chose the right means (to achieve a right end)
  18,93,"[And he marched on] till, when he reached [a place] between the two mountain-barriers, he found beneath them a people who could scarcely understand a word [of his language]"
  18,94,"They said: \"O thou Two-Horned One! Behold, Gog and Magog\" are spoiling this land. May we, then, pay unto thee a tribute on the understanding that thou wilt erect a barrier between us and them"
  18,95,"He answered: \"That wherein my Sustainer has so securely established me is better [than anything that you could give me]; hence, do but help me with [your labour's] strength, [and] I shall erect a rampart between you and them"
  18,96,"Bring me ingots of iron!\" Then, after he had [piled up the iron and] filled the gap between the two mountain-sides, he said: \"[Light a fire and] ply your bellows!\" At length, when he had made it [glow like] fire, he commanded: \"Bring me molten copper which I may pour upon it"
  18,97,"And thus [the rampart was built, and] their enemies were unable to scale it, and neither were they able to pierce it"
