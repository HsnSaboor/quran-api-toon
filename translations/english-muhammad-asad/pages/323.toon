quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  21,11,"For, how many a community that persisted in evildoing have We dashed into fragments, and raised another people in its stead"
  21,12,"And [every time,] as soon as they began to feel Our punishing might, lo! they tried to flee from it"
  21,13,"[and at the same time they seemed to hear a scornful voice]: “Do not try to flee, but return to all that [once] gave you pleasure and corrupted your whole being. and [return] to your homes, so that you might be called to account [for what you have done]!”"
  21,14,"And they could only cry: “Oh, woe unto us! Verily, we were wrongdoers!”"
  21,15,"And that cry of theirs did not cease until We caused them to become [like] a field mown down, still and silent as ashes"
  21,16,"AND [know that] We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in mere idle play"
  21,17,"[for,] had We willed to indulge in a pastime, We would indeed have produced it from within Ourselves - if such had been Our will at all"
  21,18,"Nay, but [by the very act of creation] We hurl the truth against falsehood, and it crushes the latter: and lo! it withers away. But woe unto you for all your [attempts at] defining [God] –"
  21,19,"for, unto Him belong all [beings] that are in the heavens and on earth; and those that are with Him are never too proud to worship Him and never grow weary [thereof]"
  21,20,"they extol His limitless glory by night and by day, never flagging [therein]"
  21,21,"And yet some people choose to worship certain earthly things or beings as deities that [are supposed to] resurrect [the dead; and they fail to realize that]"
  21,22,"had there been in heaven or on earth any deities other than God, both [those realms would surely have fallen into ruin! But limitless in His glory is God, enthroned in His awesome almightiness far] above anything that men may devise by way of definition"
  21,23,"He cannot be called to account for whatever He does, whereas they will be called to account"
  21,24,"and yet, they choose to worship [imaginary] deities instead of Him! Say [O Prophet]: “Produce an evidence for what you are claiming: this is a reminder [unceasingly voiced] by those who are with me, just as it was a reminder [voiced] by those who came before me.” But nay, most of them do not know the truth, and so they stubbornly turn away [from it]"
