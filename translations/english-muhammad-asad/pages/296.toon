quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,21,"AND IN THIS way have We drawn [people's] attention to their story, so that they might know - whenever they debate among themselves as to what happened to those [Men of the Cave] that God's promise [of resurrection] is true, and that there can be no doubt as to [the coming of] the Last Hour. And so, some [people] said: \"Erect a building in their memory; God knows best what happened to them.\" Said they whose opinion prevailed in the end: \"Indeed, we must surely raise a house of worship in their memory"
  18,22,"[And in times to come] some will say, \"[They were] three, the fourth of them being their dog,\" while others will say, \"Five, with their dog as the sixth of them\" -idly guessing at something of which they can have no knowledge -and [so on, until] some will say, \"[They were] seven, the eighth of them being their dog.\" Say: \"My Sustainer knows best how many they were. None but a few have any [real] knowledge of them. Hence, do not argue about them otherwise than by way of an obvious argument, and do not ask any of those [story-tellers] to enlighten thee about them"
  18,23,"AND NEVER say about anything, \"Behold, I shall do this tomorrow"
  18,24,"without (adding], \"if God so wills.\" And if thou shouldst forget [thyself at the time, and become aware of it later], call thy Sustainer to mind and say: \"I pray that my Sustainer guide me, even closer than this, to a consciousness of what is right"
  18,25,"AND [some people assert], \"They remained in their cave three hundred years\"; and some have added nine [to that number]"
  18,26,"Say: \"God knows best how long they remained [there]. His [alone] is the knowledge of the hidden reality of the heavens and the earth: how well does He see and hear! No guardian have they apart from Him, since He allots to no one a share in His rule"
  18,27,"AND CONVEY [to the world] whatever has been revealed to thee of thy Sustainer's writ. There is nothing that could alter His words; and thou canst find no refuge other than with Him"
