quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  10,79,"And Pharaoh commanded: \"Bring before me every sorcerer of great knowledge"
  10,80,"And when the sorcerers came, Moses said unto them: \"Throw whatever you may [wish to] throw"
  10,81,"And when they threw down [their staffs and cast a spell upon the people's eyes], Moses said unto them: \"What you have contrived is [but] sorcery which, verily, God will bring to nought! Verily, God does not further the works of spreaders of corruption"
  10,82,"whereas by His words God proves the truth to be true, however hateful this may be to those who are lost in sin"
  10,83,"But none save a few of his people declared their faith in Moses, [while others held back] for fear of Pharaoh and their great ones, lest they persecute them: for, verily, Pharaoh was mighty on earth and was, verily, of those who are given to excesses"
  10,84,"And Moses said: \"O my people! If you believe in God, place your trust in Him -if you have [truly] surrendered yourselves unto Him"
  10,85,"Whereupon they answered: \"In God have we placed our trust! O our Sustainer, make us not a plaything for evildoing folk"
  10,86,"and save us, by Thy grace, from people who deny the truth"
  10,87,"And [thus] did We inspire Moses and his brother: \"Set aside for your people some houses in the city, and [tell them], `Turn your houses into places of worship, and be constant in prayer!' And give thou [O Moses] the glad tiding [of God's succour] to all believers"
  10,88,"And Moses prayed: \"O our Sustainer! Verily, splendour and riches hast Thou vouchsafed, in the life of this world, unto Pharaoh and his great ones-with the result, O our Sustainer, that they are leading [others] astray from Thy path! O our Sustainer! Wipe out their riches, and harden their hearts, so that they may not attain to faith ere they see the grievous suffering [that awaits them]"
