  7,23,"The two replied: \"O our Sustainer! We have sinned against ourselves -and unless Thou grant us forgiveness and bestow Thy mercy upon us, we shall most certainly be lost"
  7,24,"Said He: \"Down with you, [and be henceforth] enemies unto one another, having on earth your abode and livelihood for a while"
  7,25,"there shall you live\" - He added - \"and there shall you die, and thence shall you be brought forth [on Resurrection Day]"
  7,26,"O CHILDREN of Adam! Indeed, We have bestowed upon you from on high [the knowledge of making] garments to cover your nakedness, and as a thing of beauty: but the garment of God-consciousness is the best of all. Herein lies a message from God, so that man” might take it to heart"
  7,27,"O children of Adam! Do not allow Satan to seduce you in the same way as he caused your ancestors to be driven out of the garden: he deprived them of their garment [of God-consciousness] in order to make them aware of their nakedness. Verily, he and his tribe are lying in wait for you where you cannot perceive them! Verily, We have placed [all manner of] satanic forces near unto those who do not [truly] believe"
  7,28,"and [so,] whenever they commit a shameful deed, they are wont to say, \"We found our forefathers doing it,\" and, \"God has enjoined it upon us.\" Say: \"Behold, never does God enjoin deeds of abomination. Would you attribute unto God something of which you have no knowledge"
  7,29,"Say: \"My Sustainer has [but] enjoined the doing of what is right; and [He desires you to] put your whole being into every act of worship, and to call unto Him, sincere in your faith in Him alone. As it was He who brought you into being in the first instance, so also [unto Him] you will return"
  7,30,"some [of you] He will have graced with His guidance, whereas, for some a straying from the right path will have become unavoidable: for, behold, they will have taken [their own] evil impulses for their masters in preference to God, thinking all the while that they have found the right path"
