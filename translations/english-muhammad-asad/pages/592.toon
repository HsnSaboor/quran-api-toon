quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,"But nay, [O men,] you prefer the life of this world"
  87,17,although the life to come is better and more enduring
  87,18,"Verily, [all] this has indeed been [said] in the earlier revelations –"
  87,19,the revelations of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,HAS THERE COME unto thee the tiding of the Overshadowing Event
  88,2,Some faces will on that Day be downcast
  88,3,"toiling [under burdens of sin], worn out [by fear]"
  88,4,about to enter a glowing fire
  88,5,given to drink from a boiling spring
  88,6,No food for them save the bitterness of dry thorns
  88,7,which gives no strength and neither stills hunger
  88,8,"[And] some faces will on that Day shine with bliss"
  88,9,"well-pleased with [the fruit of] their striving"
  88,10,in a garden sublime
  88,11,wherein thou wilt hear no empty talk
  88,12,Countless springs will flow therein
  88,13,"[and] there will be thrones [of happiness] raised high"
  88,14,and goblets placed ready
  88,15,and cushions ranged
  88,16,and carpets spread out…
  88,17,"DO, THEN, they [who deny resurrection] never gaze at the clouds pregnant with water, [and observe] how they are created"
  88,18,"And at the sky, how it is raised aloft"
  88,19,"And at the mountains, how firmly they are reared"
  88,20,"And at the earth, how it is spread out"
  88,21,"And so, [O Prophet,] exhort them; thy task is only to exhort"
  88,22,"thou canst not compel them [to believe]"
  88,23,"However, as for him who turns away, being bent on denying the truth"
  88,24,"him will God cause to suffer the greatest suffering [in the life to come]"
  88,25,"for behold, unto Us will be their return"
  88,26,"and verily, It is for Us to call them to account"
