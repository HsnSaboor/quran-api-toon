quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Say: \"What could most weightily bear witness to the truth?\" Say: \"God is witness between me and you; and this Qur’an has been revealed unto me so that on the strength thereof I might warn you and all whom it may reach.\" Could you in truth bear witness that there are other deities side by side with God? Say: \"I bear no [such] witness!\" Say: \"He is the One God; and, behold, far be it from me to ascribe divinity, as, you do, to aught beside Him"
  6,20,"They unto whom we have vouchsafed revelation aforetime know this as they know their own children; yet those [of them] who have squandered their own selves -it is they who refuse to believe"
  6,21,"And who could be more wicked than he who attributes his own lying inventions to God or gives the lie to His messages? Verily, such evildoers will never attain to a happy state"
  6,22,"for one Day We shall gather them all together, and then We shall say unto those who ascribed divinity to aught beside God: \"Where, now, are those beings whom you imagined to have a share in God's divinity"
  6,23,"Whereupon, in their utter confusion, they will only [be able to] say: \"By God, our Sustainer, we did not [mean to] ascribe divinity to aught beside Him"

  6,25,"And there are among them such as [seem to] listen to thee [O Prophet]: but over their hearts We have laid veils which prevent them from grasping the truth, and into their ears, deafness.

  6,26,"And they bar others therefrom. and go far away from it: but they destroy none but themselves, and perceive it not"
  6,27,"If thou couldst but see [them] when they will be made to stand before the fire and will say, \"Oh, would that we were brought back [to life]: then we would not give the lie to our Sustainer's messages, but would be among the believers"
