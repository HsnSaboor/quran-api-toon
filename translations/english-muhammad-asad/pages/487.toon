quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  42,32,"And among His signs are the ships that sail like [floating] mountains through the seas"
  42,33,"if He so wills, He stills the wind, and then they lie motionless on the sea’s surface - [and] herein, behold, there are messages indeed for all who are wholly patient in adversity and deeply grateful [to God]"
  42,34,"or else He may cause them to perish because of what they have wrought; and [withal,] He pardons much"
  42,35,"And let them know, those who call Our messages in question, that for them there is no escape"
  42,36,"AND [remember that] whatever you are given [now] is but for the [passing] enjoyment of life in this world - whereas that which is with God is far better and more enduring. [It shall be given] to all who attain to faith and in their Sustainer place their trust"
  42,37,"and who shun the more heinous sins and abominations; and who, whenever they are moved to anger, readily forgive"
  42,38,"and who respond to [the call of] their Sustainer and are constant in prayer; and whose rule [in all matters of common concern] is consultation among themselves; and who spend on others out of what We provide for them as sustenance"
  42,39,"and who, whenever tyranny afflicts them, defend themselves"
  42,40,"But [remember that an attempt at] requiting evil may, too, become an evil: hence, whoever pardons [his foe] and makes peace, his reward rests with God - for, verily, He does not love evildoers"
  42,41,"Yet indeed, as for any who defend themselves after having been wronged - no blame whatever attaches to them"
  42,42,"blame attaches but to those who oppress [other] people and behave outrageously on earth, offending against all right: for them there is grievous suffering in store"
  42,43,"But withal, if one is patient in adversity and forgives - this, behold, is indeed something to set one’s heart upon"
  42,44,"AND [thus it is:] he whom God lets go astray has henceforth no protector whatever: and so thou wilt see such evildoers [on Judgment Day, and wilt hear how] they exclaim as soon as they behold the suffering [that awaits them], “Is there any way of return?”"
