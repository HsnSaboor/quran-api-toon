  2,94,"Say: \"If an afterlife with God is to be for you alone, to the exclusion of all other people, then. you should long for death-if what you say is true"
  2,95,"But never will they long for it, because [they are aware] of what their hands have sent ahead in this world: and God has full knowledge of evildoers"
  2,96,"And thou wilt most certainly find that they cling to life more eagerly than any other people, even more than those who are bent on ascribing divinity to other beings beside God: every one of them would love to live a thousand years, although the grant of long life could not save him from suffering [in the hereafter]: for God sees all that they do"

  2,98,"whosover is an enemy of God and His angels and His message-bearers, including Gabriel and Michael, [should know that,] verily, God is the enemy of all who deny the truth"
  2,99,"For, clear messages indeed have We bestowed upon thee from on high; and none denies their truth save the iniquitous"
  2,100,"Is it not so that every time they made a promise [unto God], some of them cast it aside? Nay, indeed: most of them do not believe"
  2,101,"And [even now,] when there has come unto them an apostle from God, confirming the truth already in their possession, some of those who were granted revelation aforetime cast the divine writ behind their backs as though unaware [of what it says]"
