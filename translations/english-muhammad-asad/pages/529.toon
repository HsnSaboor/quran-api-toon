quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  54,7,"they will come forth from their graves, with their eyes downcast, [swarming about] like locusts scattered [by the wind]"
  54,8,"running in confusion towards the Summoning Voice; [and] those who [now] deny the truth will exclaim, “Calamitous is this Day!”"
  54,9,"[LONG] BEFORE those [who now deny resurrection] did Noah’s people call it a lie; and they gave the lie to Our servant and said, “Mad is he!” - and he was repulsed"
  54,10,"Thereupon he called out to his Sustainer, “Verily, I am defeated; come Thou, then, to my succour!”"
  54,11,And so We caused the gates of heaven to open with water pouring down in torrents
  54,12,"and caused the earth to burst forth with springs, so that the waters met for a purpose pre-ordained"
  54,13,"but him We bore on that [vessel] made of [mere] planks and nails"
  54,14,"and it floated under Our eyes: a recompense for him who had been rejected with ingratitude"
  54,15,"And, indeed, We have caused such [floating vessels] to remain forever a sign [of Our grace unto man]: who, then, is willing to take it to heart"
  54,16,And how severe is the suffering which I inflict when My warnings are disregarded
  54,17,"Hence, indeed, We made this Qur’an easy to bear in mind: who, then, is willing to take it to heart"
  54,18,"TO THE TRUTH gave the lie [the tribe of] Ad: and how severe was the suffering which I inflicted when My warnings were disregarded"
  54,19,"Behold, We let loose upon them a raging storm wind on a day of bitter misfortune"
  54,20,it swept the people away as though they were palm-trunks uprooted
  54,21,"for, how severe is the suffering which I inflict when My warnings are disregarded"
  54,22,"Hence, indeed, We made this Qur’an easy to bear in mind: who, then, is willing to take it to heart"
  54,23,"[AND the tribe of] Thamud gave the lie to all [Our] warnings"
  54,24,"and they said: “Are we to follow one single mortal, one from among ourselves? In that case, behold, we would certainly sink into error and folly"
  54,25,"Why - on him alone from among all of us should a [divine] reminder have been bestowed? Nay, but he is a boastful liar!”"
  54,26,"[And God said:] “On the morrow they will come to know who the boastful liar is"
  54,27,"Behold, [O Salih] We are letting loose this she-camel as a test for them; and thou but watch them, and contain thyself in patience"
