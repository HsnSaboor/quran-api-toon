  17,90,"and so they say: \"[O Muhammad,] we shall not believe thee till thou cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth"

  17,92,"or thou cause the skies to fall down upon us in smithereens, as thou hast threatened, or [till] thou bring God and the angels face to face before us"
  17,93,"or thou have a house [made] of gold, or thou ascend to heaven - but nay, we would not [even] believe in thy ascension unless thou bring down to us [from heaven] a writing which we [ourselves] could read!

  17,95,"Say: \"If angels were walking about on earth as their natural abode, We would indeed have sent down unto them an angel out of heaven as Our apostle"
  17,96,"Say: \"None can bear witness between me and you as God does: verily, fully aware is He of His creatures, and He sees all [that is in their hearts]"
