  37,78,and We left him thus to be remembered among later generations
  37,79,“Peace be upon Noah throughout all the worlds!”
  37,80,"Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good –"
  37,81,for he was truly one of our believing servants
  37,82,"[and so We saved him and those who followed him] and then We caused the others to drown"
  37,83,"AND, BEHOLD, of his persuasion was Abraham, too"
  37,84,when he turned to his Sustainer with a heart free of evil
  37,85,"and [thus] spoke to his father and his people: “What is it that you worship"
  37,86,"Do you want [to bow down before] a lie - [before] deities other than God"
  37,87,"What, then, do you think of the Sustainer of all the worlds?”"
  37,88,Then he cast a glance at the stars
  37,89,"and said, “Verily, I am sick [at heart]!”"
  37,90,and at that they turned their backs on him and went away

  37,98,"But whereas they sought to do evil unto him, We [frustrated their designs, and thus] brought them low"

  37,100,"[And he prayed:] “O my Sustainer! Bestow upon me the gift of [a son who shall be] one of the righteous!” –"
  37,101,"whereupon We gave him the glad tiding of a boy-child gentle [like himself]"
  37,102,"And [one day,] when [the child] had become old enough to share in his [father’s] endeavours, the latter said: “O my dear son! I have seen in a dream that I should sacrifice thee: consider, then, what would be thy view!” [Ishmael] answered: “O my father! Do as thou art bidden: thou wilt find me, if God so wills, among those who are patient in adversity!”"
