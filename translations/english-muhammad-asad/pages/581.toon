  77,20,Did We not create you out of a humble fluid
  77,21,"which We then let remain in [the womb's] firm keeping"
  77,22,for a term pre-ordained
  77,23,"Thus have We determined [the nature of man's creation]: and excellent indeed is Our power to determine [what is to be]"
  77,24,"Woe, on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth"
  77,25,Have We not caused the earth to hold within itself
  77,26,the living and the dead
  77,27,"and have We not set on it proud, firm mountains, and given you sweet water to drink"
  77,28,Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth
  77,29,"GO ON towards that [resurrection] which you were wont to call a lie"
  77,30,Go on towards the threefold shadow
  77,31,"that will offer no [cooling] shade and will be of no avail against the flame"
  77,32,"which – behold!- will throw up sparks like [burning] logs"
  77,33,like giant fiery ropes
  77,34,Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth –
  77,35,"that Day on which they will not [be able to] utter a word"
  77,36,nor be allowed to proffer excuses
  77,37,Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth –
  77,38,"that Day of Distinction [between the true and the false, when they will be told]: \"We have brought you together with those [sinners] of olden times"
  77,39,"and if you [think that you] have a subterfuge left, try to outwit Me"
  77,40,Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth
  77,41,"[AS AGAINST this,] behold, the God-conscious shall dwell amidst [cooling] shades and springs"
  77,42,"and [partake of] whatever fruit they may desire"
  77,43,"[and they will be told:] \"Eat and drink in good cheer in return for what you did [in life]"
  77,44,"Thus, behold, do We reward the doers of good"
  77,45,"[but] woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth"
  77,46,"EAT [your fill] and enjoy your life for a little while, O you who are lost in sin"
  77,47,"[But] woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth"
  77,48,"and when they are told, \"Bow down [before God]\", do not bow down"
  77,49,woe on that Day unto those who give the to the truth
  77,50,"In what other tiding, then, will they, after this, believe"
