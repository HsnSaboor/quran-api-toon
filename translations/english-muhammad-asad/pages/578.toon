  75,20,"NAY, but [most of] you love this fleeting life"
  75,21,"and give no thought to the life to come [and to Judgment Day]"
  75,22,Some faces will on that Day be bright with happiness
  75,23,looking up to their Sustainer
  75,24,and some faces will on that Day be overcast with despair
  75,25,knowing that a crushing calamity is about to befall them
  75,26,"NAY, but when [the last breath] comes up to the throat [of a dying man]"
  75,27,"and people ask, \"Is there any wizard [that could save him]"
  75,28,"the while he [himself] knows that this is the parting"
  75,29,and is enwrapped in the pangs of death
  75,30,at that time towards thy Sustainer does he feel impelled to turn
  75,31,"Useless, though, will be his repentance: for [as long as he was alive] he did not accept the truth, nor did he pray [for enlightenment]"
  75,32,"but, on the contrary, he gave the lie to the truth and turned away [from it]"
  75,33,and then went arrogantly back to what he had come from
  75,34,"[And yet, O man, thine end comes hourly] nearer unto thee, and nearer –"
  75,35,"and ever nearer unto thee, and nearer"
  75,36,"DOES MAN, then, think that he is to be left to himself to go about at will"
  75,37,"Was he not once a [mere] drop of sperm that had been spilt"
  75,38,"and thereafter became a germ-cell - whereupon He created and formed [it] in accordance with what [it] was meant to be"
  75,39,"and fashioned out of it the two sexes, the male and the female"
  75,40,"Is not He, then; able to bring the dead back to life"
  76,1,"HAS THERE [not] been an endless span of time before man [appeared - a time] when he was not yet a thing to be thought of"
  76,2,"Verily, it is We who have created man out of a drop of sperm intermingled, so that We might try him [in his later life]: and therefore We made him a being endowed with hearing and sight"
  76,3,"Verily, We have shown him the way: [and it rests with him to prove himself] either grateful or ungrateful"
  76,4,"[Now,] behold, for those who deny the truth We have readied chains and shackles, and a blazing flame"
  76,5,"[whereas,] behold, the truly virtuous shall drink from a cup flavoured with the calyx of sweet-smelling flowers"
