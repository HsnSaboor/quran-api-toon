  11,38,"And [so Noah] set himself to building the ark; and every time the great ones of his people passed by him, they scoffed at him. [Thereupon] he said: \"If you are scoffing at us-behold, we are scoffing at you [and your ignorance], just as you are scoffing at us"
  11,39,"But in time you will come to know who it is that [in this world] shall be visited by suffering which will cover him with ignominy, and upon whom long lasting suffering shall alight [in the life to come]"
