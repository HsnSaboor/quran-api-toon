quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,"And [it ought to be] a sign for them that We bear their offspring [over the seas] in laden ships"
  36,42,"and [that] We create for them things of a similar kind, on which they may embark [in their travels]"
  36,43,"and [that,] if such be Our will, We may cause them to drown, with none to respond to their cry for help: and [then] they cannot be saved"
  36,44,"unless it be by an act of mercy from Us and a grant of life for a [further span of] time"
  36,45,"And [yet,] when they are told, “Beware of [God’s insight into] all that lies open before you and all that is hidden from you, so that you might be graced with His mercy,” [most men choose to remain deaf]"
  36,46,and no message of their Sustainer s messages ever reaches them without their turning away from it
  36,47,"Thus, when they are told, “Spend on others out of what God has provided for you as sustenance,” those who are bent on denying the truth say unto those who believe, “Shall we feed anyone whom, if [your] God had so willed, He could have fed [Himself]? Clearly, you are but lost in error!”"
  36,48,"And they add, “When is this promise [of resurrection] to be fulfilled? [Answer this] if you are men of truth!”"
  36,49,"[And they are unaware that] nothing awaits them beyond a single blast [of God’s punishment], which will overtake them while they are still arguing - [against resurrection]"
  36,50,"and so [sudden will be their end that] no testament will they be able to make, - nor to their own people will they return"
  36,51,"And [then] the trumpet [of resurrection] will be blown - and lo! out of their graves towards their Sustainer will they all rush forth"
  36,52,"They will say: “Oh, woe unto us! Who has roused us from our sleep [of death]?” [Whereupon they will be told:] “This is what the Most Gracious has promised! And His message-bearers spoke the truth!”"
  36,53,"Nothing will there have been but one single blast - and lo! before Us will all of them be arraigned [and be told]"
  36,54,"“Today, then, no human being shall be wronged in the least, nor shalt you be requited for aught but what you were doing [on earth]"
