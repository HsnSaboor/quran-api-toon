quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"BEHOLD, [O Prophet,] thy Sustainer knows that thou keepest awake [in prayer] nearly two-thirds of the night, or one-half of it, or a third of it, together with some of those who follow thee. And God who determines the measure of night and day, is aware that you would never grudge it: and therefore He turns towards you in His grace. Recite, then, as much of the Qur’an as you may do with ease. He knows that in time there will be among you sick people, and others who will go about the land in search of God's bounty, and others who will fight in God’s cause. Recite, then, [only] as much of it as you may do with ease, and be constant in prayer, and spend in charity, and [thus] lend unto God a goodly loan: for whatever good deed you may offer up in your own behalf, you shall truly find it with God - yea, better, and richer in reward. And [always] seek God's forgiveness: behold, God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace"
  74,1,"O THOU [in thy solitude] enfolded"
  74,2,Arise and warn
  74,3,And thy Sustainer's greatness glorify
  74,4,And thine inner self purify
  74,5,And all defilement shun
  74,6,And do not through giving seek thyself to gain
  74,7,but unto thy Sustainer turn in patience
  74,8,"And [warn all men that] when the trumpet-call [of resurrection] is sounded"
  74,9,that very Day shall be a day of anguish
  74,10,"not of ease, for all who [now] deny the truth"
  74,11,"LEAVE Me alone [to deal] with him whom I have created alone"
  74,12,and to whom I have granted resources vast
  74,13,"and children as [love's] witnesses"
  74,14,and to whose life I gave so wide a scope
  74,15,"and yet, he greedily desires that I give yet more"
  74,16,"Nay, verily, it is against Our messages that he knowingly, stubbornly sets himself"
  74,17,"[and so] I shall constrain him to endure a painful uphill climb"
