quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,74,"And remember how He made you heirs to [the tribe of] `Ad and settled you firmly on earth, so that you [are able to] build for yourselves castles on its plains and hew out mountains [to serve you] as dwellings: remember, then, God's blessings, and do not act wickedly on earth by spreading corruption"
  7,75,"The great ones among his people, who gloried in their arrogance towards all who were deemed weak, said unto the believers among them: \"Do you [really] know that salih has been sent by his Sustainer?\" They answered: \"Verily, we believe in the message which he bears"
  7,76,"[But] the arrogant ones said: \"Behold, what you have come to believe in we refuse to regard as true"
  7,77,"And then they cruelly slaughtered the she-camel and turned with disdain from their Sustainer's commandment, and said: \"O Salih! Bring about that [punishment] with which thou hast threatened us, if thou art truly one of God's message bearers"
  7,78,"Thereupon an earthquake overtook them: and then they lay lifeless, in their very homes, on the ground"
  7,79,"And [Salih] turned away from them, and said: \"O my people! Indeed, I delivered unto you my Sustainer's message and gave you good advice: but you did not love those who gave [you] good advice"
  7,80,"AND [remember] Lot, when he said unto his people: \"Will you commit abominations such as none in all the world has ever done before you"
  7,81,"Verily, with lust you approach men instead of women: nay, but you are people given to excesses"
