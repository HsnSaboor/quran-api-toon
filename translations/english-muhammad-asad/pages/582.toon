quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,"ABOUT WHAT do they [most often] ask one another"
  78,2,"About the awesome tiding [of resurrection]"
  78,3,"on which they [so utterly] disagree"
  78,4,"Nay, but in time they will come to understand [it]"
  78,5,"And once again: Nay, but in time they will come to understand"
  78,6,"HAVE WE NOT made the earth a resting-place [for you]"
  78,7,"and the mountains [its] pegs"
  78,8,And We have created you in pairs
  78,9,"and We have made your sleep [a symbol of] death"
  78,10,"and made the night [its] cloak"
  78,11,"and made the day [a symbol of] life"
  78,12,And We have built above you seven firmaments
  78,13,"and have placed [therein the sun,] a lamp full of blazing splendour"
  78,14,And from the wind-driven clouds We send down waters pouring in abundance
  78,15,"so that We might bring forth thereby grain, and herbs"
  78,16,and gardens dense with follage
  78,17,"VERILY, the Day of Distinction [between the true and the false] has indeed its appointed time"
  78,18,"the Day when the trumpet [of resurrection] is sounded and you all come forward in multitudes"
  78,19,"and when the skies are opened and become [as wide-flung] gates"
  78,20,and when the mountains are made to vanish as if they had been a mirage
  78,21,"[On that Day,] verily, hell will lie in wait [for those who deny the truth] –"
  78,22,a goal for all who are wont to transgress the bounds of what is right
  78,23,In it shall they remain for a long time
  78,24,"Neither coolness shall they taste therein nor any [thirst-quenching] drink –"
  78,25,only burning despair and ice-cold darkness
  78,26,"a meet requital [for their sins]"
  78,27,"Behold, they were not expecting to be called to account"
  78,28,having given the lie to Our messages one and all
  78,29,"but We have placed on record every single thing [of what they did]"
  78,30,"[And so We shall say:] \"Taste, then, [the fruit of your evil doings,] for now We shall bestow on you nothing but more and more suffering"
