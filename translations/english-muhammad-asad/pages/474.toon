  40,62,"Such is God, your Sustainer, the Creator of all that exists: there is no deity save Him. How perverted, then, are your minds"

  40,64,"It is God who has made the earth a resting- place for you and the sky a canopy, and has formed you - and formed you so well and provided for you sustenance out of the good things of life. Such is God, your Sustainer: hallowed, then, is God, the Sustainer of all the worlds"
  40,65,"He is the Ever-Living; there is no deity save Him: call, then, unto Him [alone], sincere in your faith in Him. All praise is due to God, the Sustainer of all the worlds"
