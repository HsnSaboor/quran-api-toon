quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  26,20,"Replied [Moses]: “I committed it while I was still going astray"
  26,21,"and I fled from you because I feared you. But [since] then my Sustainer has endowed me with the ability to judge [between right and wrong], and has made me one of [His] message-bearers"
  26,22,"And [as for] that favour of which thou so tauntingly remindest me - [was it not] due to thy having enslaved the children of Israel?”"
  26,23,"Said Pharaoh: “And what [and who] is that ‘Sustainer of all the worlds’?”"
  26,24,"[Moses] answered: “[He is] the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them: if you would but [allow yourselves to] be convinced!”"
  26,25,"Said [Pharaoh] unto those around him: “Did you hear [what he said]?”"
  26,26,"[And Moses] continued: “[He is] your Sustainer, [too,] as well as the Sustainer of your forefathers of old!”"
  26,27,"[Pharaoh] exclaimed: “Behold, [this] your ‘apostle’ who [claims that he] has been sent unto you is mad indeed"
  26,28,"[But Moses] went on: “[He of whom I speak is] the Sustainer of the east and the west and of all that is between the two”- as you would know] if you would but use your reason!”"
  26,29,"Said [Pharaoh]: “Indeed, if thou choose to worship any deity other than me, I shall most certainly throw thee into prison"
  26,30,"Said he: “Even if I should bring about before thee something that clearly shows the truth?”"
  26,31,"[Pharaoh] answered: “Produce it, then, if thou art a man of truth!”"
  26,32,"Thereupon [Moses] threw down his staff - and lo! it was a serpent, plainly visible"
  26,33,"and he drew forth his hand - and lo! it appeared [shining] white to the beholders"
  26,34,"Said [pharaoh] unto the great ones around him: “Verily, this is indeed a sorcerer of great knowledge"
  26,35,"who wants to drive you out of your land by his sorcery. What, then, do you advise?”"
  26,36,"They answered: “Let him and his brother wait a while, and send unto all cities heralds"
  26,37,who shall assemble before thee all sorcerers of great knowledge”
  26,38,And so the sorcerers were assembled at a set time on a certain day
  26,39,"and the people were asked: Are you all present"
