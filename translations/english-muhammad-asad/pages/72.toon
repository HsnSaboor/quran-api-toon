quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,166,"and all that befell you on the day when the two hosts met in battle happened by God's leave, so that He might mark out the [true] believers"
  3,167,"and mark out those who were tainted with hypocrisy and, when they were told, \"Come, fight in God's cause\" - or, \"Defend yourselves\" - answered, \"If we but knew [that it would come to a] fight, we would indeed follow you.\" Unto apostasy were they nearer on that day than unto faith, uttering with their mouths something which was not in their hearts, the while God knew fully well what they were trying to conceal"
  3,168,"they who, having themselves held back [from fighting, later] said of their [slain] brethren, \"Had they but paid heed to us, they would not have been slain.\" Say: \"Avert, then, death from yourselves, if what you say is true"
  3,169,"But do not think of those that have been slain in God's cause as dead. Nay, they are alive! With their Sustainer have they their sustenance"
  3,170,"exulting in that [martyrdom] which God has bestowed upon them out of His bounty. And they rejoice in the glad tiding given to those [of their brethren] who have been left behind and have not yet joined them, that no fear need they have, and neither shall they grieve"
  3,171,"they rejoice in the glad tiding of God's blessings and bounty, and [in the promise] that God will not fail to requite the believers"
  3,172,who responded to the call of God and the Apostle after misfortune had befallen them. A magnificent requital awaits those of them who have persevered in doing good and remained conscious of God
  3,173,"those who have been warned by other people, \"Behold, a host has gathered against you; so beware of them!\" - whereupon this only increased their faith, so that they answered, \"God is enough for us; and how excellent a guardian is He!”"
