quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,"[the fire] which none shall have to endure but that most hapless wretch"
  92,16,"who gives the lie to the truth and turns away [from it]"
  92,17,"For, distant from it shall remain he who is truly conscious of God"
  92,18,"he that spends his possessions [on others] so that he might grow in purity –"
  92,19,not as payment for favours received
  92,20,"but only out of a longing for the countenance of his Sustainer, the All-Highest"
  92,21,"and such, indeed, shall in time be well-pleased"
  93,1,CONSIDER the bright morning hours
  93,2,and the night when it grows still and dark
  93,3,"Thy Sustainer has not forsaken thee, nor does He scorn thee"
  93,4,"for, indeed, the life to come will be better for thee than this earlier part [of thy life]"
  93,5,"And, indeed, in time will thy Sustainer grant thee [what thy heart desires], and thou shalt be well-pleased"
  93,6,"Has He not found thee an orphan, and given thee shelter"
  93,7,"And found thee lost on thy way, and guided thee"
  93,8,"And found thee in want, and given thee sufficiency"
  93,9,"Therefore, the orphan shalt thou never wrong"
  93,10,"and him that seeks [thy] help shalt thou never chide"
  93,11,"and of thy Sustainer's blessings shalt thou [ever] speak"
  94,1,HAVE WE NOT opened up thy heart
  94,2,and lifted from thee the burden
  94,3,that had weighed so heavily on thy back
  94,4,"And [have We not] raised thee high in dignity"
  94,5,"And, behold, with every hardship comes ease"
  94,6,"verily, with every hardship comes ease"
  94,7,"Hence, when thou art freed [from distress], remain steadfast"
  94,8,and unto thy Sustainer turn with love
