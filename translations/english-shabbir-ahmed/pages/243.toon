quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  12,64,"Jacob said, \"Shall I trust you with him as I trusted you with his brother? Allah is better at Guarding and He is the most Merciful of the merciful"
  12,65,"When they opened their packs, they discovered that their barter had been returned to them. (The grand minister, the Prophet of God, had paid on their behalf). They said, \"O Our father! What more can we ask? We shall bring food for our family and guard our brother. And we shall have the extra measure of a camel load. The first load we have brought is but scant"
