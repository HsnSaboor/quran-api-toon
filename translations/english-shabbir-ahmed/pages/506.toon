quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  46,29,"(O Messenger) Behold, We turned toward you a company of the nomads so that they might listen to the Qur'an. And as soon as they were in its presence, they said, \"Listen in silence!\" And when it was over, they hurried to their people as Warners"
  46,30,"They said, \"O Our people! Behold, We have heard a Scripture that has been revealed after Moses, confirming the Divine Origin of what came before it. It guides to the Truth and to a Straight Road"
  46,31,O Our people! Respond to the one who invites to Allah and believe in Him. He will absolve your fault of trailing behind and guard you against an awful suffering
  46,32,"And whoever fails to respond to Allah's caller, cannot evade Him on earth, nor can he find patrons other than Him. Such people are obviously lost in error"
  46,33,"Do they not realize that Allah Who created the heavens and the earth, and wearied not with their creation, is Able to revive the dead? Yes, indeed, He has power over all things"
  46,34,"And on the Day when the rejecters will be exposed to the Fire (they will be asked), \"Is it not for real?\" They will answer, \"Yes indeed, by our Lord!\" He will say, \"Taste, then, this punishment as a consequence of your denial of the Truth"
  46,35,"And so, hold on to patience, as did the Messengers of firm resolve. And hasten not about which way they choose. On the Day when they shall see what they are promised, it will seem to them as if they had not lived in the world more than an hour of the day. A Clear Message! Shall anyone perish except those who drift away from the right path? ('What they are promised' enfolds the glad tiding if they choose to walk aright and, in that instance, they will feel that a new blissful chapter of life dawns upon them. On the other hand, 'What they are promised' enfolds grievous suffering if they persist in their denial of the Truth)"
