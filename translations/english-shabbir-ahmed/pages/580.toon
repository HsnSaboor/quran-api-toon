quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  76,26,Adore Him even at night and strive to establish His Glory on earth through long nights (as you do morning and evening)
  76,27,"Behold, these people love only the instant gains and as a result leave behind a yesterday laden (with transgressions and wasted opportunities of doing good)"
  76,28,"(Who gave them the mind and body to behave the way they choose?) We it is Who have created them, and strengthened their frame. And if We Will, We can replace them entirely with other nations. (Nations who will use their human potentials better)"
  76,29,"Behold, this is an Advisory that whoever wants, may choose a Way to his Lord"
  76,30,"Yet, you cannot will it unless you align your free will with the Will of Allah. (Guidance can only be achieved according to Divine Laws (4:88)). For, behold, Allah is Knower, Wise"
  76,31,"He admits into His Grace everyone who wills to be admitted. But, for those who wrong their 'Self' by making wrong decisions, He has prepared an awful doom. ('Zulm' = Wrongdoing = Being unjust to others or to one's own 'Self' = Oppression = Relegation of Truth = Displacing anything from its rightful place = Violation of human rights = Transgression)"
  77,1,"Witness are these Messages (to the Sublime Truth), sent forth one after another"
  77,2,As they gain strength like a tempest
  77,3,And spread (the Truth) far and wide
  77,4,While distinguishing the Right from Wrong with a clear distinction
  77,5,In order to deliver the Reminder (into the hearts)
  77,6,Whether one erases his faults or sees the danger signs. ('Uzr' = Excuse = Justification = Good news = Reasoning = Attempt to get rid of one's shortcomings. 'Nuzr' = Warning = Posting danger signs)
  77,7,"Behold, all that you are promised in this Writ will come to pass"
  77,8,So when the stars lose their luster. (The small groups of opponents fade away)
  77,9,And when the sky is rent asunder. (Every high tyrant is decimated)
  77,10,And when the mountains are blown away as dust. (The great ones who enslave the weak float around like flakes of wool). (2)
  77,11,And when all Messengers are summoned at the time appointed. (The unanimity of the Message of all Messengers will become evident)
  77,12,For what Day is the term delayed
  77,13,For the Day of Decision
  77,14,And what will enlighten you what that Day of Decision is
  77,15,Anguish on that Day for those who deny the Truth in practice! ('Kizb' = Lie = Belie = Deny the Truth in practical dealings = Deny by action. 'Kufr' = Frank denial in word and action)
  77,16,Did We not annihilate the former generations
  77,17,Then We made them followed by later generations
  77,18,Thus do We always deal with the guilty
  77,19,Anguish on that Day for those who deny the Truth in practice
