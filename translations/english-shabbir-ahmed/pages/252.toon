quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  13,19,"Is, then, he who knows that what has been revealed to you (O Prophet), is the Truth from your Sustainer, like him who chooses to remain blind? Only those who develop their insight will bear this in mind"
  13,20,"Those people of insight who: Are true to their bond with Allah (their allegiance to the Divine System). Keep their pledge with Allah and with human beings"
  13,21,"Build bridges of goodwill between people, and strengthen all ties of human relationships as Allah has commanded. (2:27). And stand in awe of their Sustainer. (They do not relegate His Commands to the level of others' utterances). And fear the eventuality of a tough accountability"
  13,22,"They persevere in the face of adversities on way to seeking the Approval of their Sustainer. They help establish and consolidate the Divine System, and the Permanent Values.

  13,23,"They will enter the Gardens of Eden, along with all who are righteous, of their parents, spouses and children. Angels will greet them at every gate"

Now those who are bent upon denying say, \"Why has no miracle ever been bestowed upon him from his Lord?\" Say, \"People go astray according to Allah's Laws, and attain guidance according to His Laws. (4:88). (Man has been endowed with free will and there is no compulsion or coercion in Religion, whether physical, emotional or intellectual (2:2)"
  13,28,"Those who attain faith through reason, their hearts find rest in the practical remembrance of Allah, that is, in following His Commands. For, verily, remembering Allah by following His Commands ensures tranquility in the hearts"
