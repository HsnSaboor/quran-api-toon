  27,1,"S. Toor-e-Sina, Mount Sinai. (The initiation of Revelation to Moses, and now), These are Messages of the Qur'an, the Book clear in itself and clearly showing the Truth"
  27,2,A Guidance and a glad tiding for the believers (in it)
  27,3,"Who establish and consolidate the Divine System and set up the Just Economic Order of Zakat. They have conviction in the life to come (that the human \"Self\" lives on after death, and that all actions meet a just requital)"
  27,4,"Those who do not believe in the eternity of the \"Self\", will obviously deny the continuation of life after death. Our Law makes their deeds of instant gratification pleasing in their eyes and so they keep stumbling blindly to and fro"

Additional Tasreef: (7:108), (20:17-24), (26:10-15), (26:32-33)"
  27,11,"Nor anyone who has replaced the wrong with good should have any fear. For, verily I am Forgiving, Merciful"
  27,12,"Now, when you present the Light in your heart with forceful Logic, it will shine with unblemished Truth. Take the Nine of My Messages to Pharaoh and his people - for, verily they are a nation drifting away from the Right Path.\" ((28:32). Nine, and not ten Commandments"
