quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  12,31,"When she heard their gossip, she invited them, and prepared comfortable couches for them, and they schemed. She gave a knife to each of the women. Then, she called Joseph, \"Come out unto them!\" And when they saw him they flattered him and 'cut their hands'. They exclaimed in their flattery, \"Good Lord! This is no mortal man! This is but an angel!\" (The governor's wife and her friends had planned to incriminate Joseph, and they were just buying time. They made marks on their hands to feign self-defense. There is absolutely no mention of the supposed \"beauty' of Joseph, a fabrication adopted by most commentators from the Bible! Secondly, the root word QAT'A in this verse is of very special significance. Did these women chop off their hands? Must the thieves get their hands chopped off? Please see)"
  12,32,"The lady of the house said, \"This is he about whom you blamed me. I tried to seduce him but he preserved himself. Since he thinks he is an angel, and remains adamant against my command, he shall be imprisoned and brought low. (And, now we have the evidence against him with marks on your hands. We will humiliate him)"
  12,33,"Joseph said, \"O My Lord! Prison is dearer to me than these women's schemes. If you did not help me fend off their design, I am afraid of their intimidation, and of behaving like the unguided"
  12,34,"His Lord heard his prayer, and helped Joseph remain steadfast in fending off their schemes. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Knower of all intentions and actions"
  12,35,(The women brought a suit against him.) The judges after seeing the marks on their hands put him in prison for a time
  12,36,"Two young men went to prison with him (for unrelated crimes). One of them (a butler) told his dream, \"I saw myself making wine.\" The other (a baker) said, \"I saw myself carrying bread on my head from which birds were eating. Can you tell us what this means? We see that you are a doer of good"
  12,37,"He said, \"I will tell you the meaning before today's meal is served. But, remember, that it is my Lord Who teaches me through Revelation. I am not one of those who reject Allah's Laws and disbelieve in the accountability of the life to come"
