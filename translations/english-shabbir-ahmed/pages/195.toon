quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,48,"They have sought to create dissension among you before, and raised difficulties for you (O Prophet). They did that till the Truth came and the Decree of Allah prevailed, though they detested it"
  9,49,"Of them is he who says, \"Grant me leave, and draw me not into trial.\" Have they not fallen into trial already? In fact, Hell is all around the disbelievers"
  9,50,"If some good comes to you (O Prophet) it afflicts them. And if calamity befalls you, they say, \"We took our precautions beforehand.\" And they turn away rejoicing"
  9,51,"Say, \"No calamity befalls us humans except within the bounds of Allah's Laws. Only He is our Lord Supreme (Maulana).\" In Allah let the believers put their trust"
  9,52,"Say, \"Can you expect for us other than one of the two things\" (victory or martyrdom in the Cause of Allah?) On the other hand, we expect for you retribution from Allah's Law of Requital, and it may be at our hands when you fight against us. Wait then hopefully, and we shall hopefully wait with you"
  9,53,"(Some hypocrites want to make financial contributions.) Tell them, \"Your contribution is not accepted whether you pay willingly or unwillingly. You are a people who drift away from the System at the first opportune time"
  9,54,"What prevents their contributions from being accepted is this: They do not truly believe in Allah and His Messenger. They only claim to believe (2:8). They join you in congregations of prayer only half-heartedly and just to be seen of men (4:142), (107:5). And they contribute only with great reluctance in their hearts. (Islam involves only willing submission to Allah)"
