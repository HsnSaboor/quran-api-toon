  71,13,What is the matter with you that you seek not for dignity toward Allah? (His Laws can give you dignity and eminence)
  71,14,Knowing that He has created you in successive stages
  71,15,Don't you realize how Allah has created the seven heavens in great harmony
  71,16,"And made the moon a light therein, and made the sun a radiant lamp"
  71,17,And Allah has caused you to grow as a growth from the earth
  71,18,"Then He returns you into the earth and He will bring you forth again, a new bringing"
  71,19,And Allah has made the earth a wide expanse for you
  71,20,That you may travel thereon on spacious valley-ways
  71,21,"Then Noah said, \"My Lord! Behold, they have opposed me throughout, for they follow him whose wealth and children have led him increasingly into ruin"
  71,22,And they plot tremendous schemes
  71,23,"And keep telling one another, \"Do not abandon your gods! And forsake not Wadd, nor Suw'a, nor Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr"
  71,24,And they have thus led a great many people astray (and divided them). And Your Laws let go more and more astray those who displace Truth with falsehood
  71,25,"And so, because of faults upon faults, they were drowned, then made to enter a Fire. And they found out that they had no helpers besides Allah. (Made to enter: Before Allah is Eternal Now. The past tense also indicates the inevitable outcome)"
