quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,135,"And they say, \"Be Jews or Christians, then you will be rightly guided.\" Say, \"Nay, we follow the Creed of Abraham, the upright. He turned away from all that is false, and ascribed divinity to none but the One True God.\" (And he was neither a Jew nor a Christian)"
  2,136,"(O Believers!) say, \"We believe in Allah and the Revelation that has been conveyed to us, and in that which was revealed to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob as well as their descendant Prophets (the tribal Israelite Prophets, known as the Patriarchs), and in that which was given to Moses and Jesus and to the other prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them (in that all of them were one in Purpose and they got their guidance from the One True God). And for Him, we are Muslims"
  2,137,"So, if they come to believe like you believe, then they are rightly guided. But if they turn away, then they are in schism and opposition and Allah will suffice you against them. For, He is the Hearer, the Knower"
  2,138,"The Hue of Allah! (Say that our life takes it color from Allah). And who can give a better hue to life than Allah? (We do our best to adopt the Divine Attributes in our human capacity such as: mercy, forgiveness, creativity, peace, care, truthfulness, justice, clemency, appreciation, trustworthiness, responsibility, kindness, compassion, independence, guidance, patience, giving, unity, strength, affection, courage, patience etc). \"And He it is Whom we serve"
  2,139,"Say (to the Jews and the Christians), \"Do you argue with us about God, when He is our Lord and your Lord? We are responsible for our deeds and you are responsible for your deeds. And we are sincere in our Faith in Him"
  2,140,"Do you still insist that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob as well as the Tribal Israelite Prophets were Jews or Christians? Say, \"Do you know better than Allah? And who could be more unjust than he who conceals a testimony that he has received from Allah? (You have received the testimony in your Scriptures). And Allah is not unaware of what you do, reveal or conceal"
  2,141,"Nevertheless, these are a people who have passed on. They are responsible for their doings and you are responsible for your doings. (Keep this Law in mind). You will not even be asked of what they used to do"
