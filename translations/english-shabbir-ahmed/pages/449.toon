  37,77,And made his progeny and followers survive
  37,78,And We left his remembrance for later generations
  37,79,Peace and salutation to Noah in the Worlds
  37,80,"Verily, this is how We reward the benefactors of humanity"
  37,81,"Behold, he was one of Our truly believing servants"
  37,82,And We caused the others to drown
  37,83,"And verily, to his group (of believers, later) belonged Abraham"
  37,84,When he came to his Lord with a noble heart
  37,85,"And thus spoke to his father and his people, \"What is that you worship"
  37,86,It is a falsehood. Do you desire gods besides Allah
  37,87,What do you think of the Lord of the Worlds
  37,88,And he glanced at the stars
  37,89,"And said, \"Behold, I am sick (of you worshiping false deities)"
  37,90,At that they turned their backs and went away from him
  37,91,"Then Abraham gently turned to their idols and said, \"What! You do not eat"
  37,92,What ails you that you speak not
  37,93,"Then he turned upon them, striking them with the right hand (struck them hard)"
  37,94,The people came running to him
  37,95,"He said, \"Do you worship that which you carve with your own hands"

  37,102,"And when he was old enough to strive along with him, Abraham said, \"O My dear son! I have a vision that I must give you to a life of test and tribulation for a Noble cause (37:107). So look, what do you think?\" He said, \"O My father! Do what you are commanded. God willing, you will find me of the steadfast.\" ('Zibh' & 'Zabh' = Sacrifice = Disregard comfort for a Noble cause. Just as 'Qatl' = Killing, fighting, humiliating, to bring low)"
