quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,26,"Pharaoh said, \"Leave it up to me to kill Moses and let him call upon his Lord. Behold, I am afraid he will change your religion and your life-style and cause uprising in the land"
  40,27,"Moses replied, \"Behold, I have found refuge with my Lord and the Lord of you all from every arrogant one who believes not in a Day of Account (and, hence, in the Law of Requital)"
  40,28,"Now a believing man among Pharaoh's folk who had thus far concealed his Faith, exclaimed, \"Would you kill a man because he says, 'My Lord is Allah', and brought you all evidence of the Truth from your Lord? If he is a liar, then his lie will fall back upon him (he will soon be exposed). But if he is a man of truth, then some of the punishment he warns you against, will certainly befall you. Verily, Allah does not guide to success any who wastes his 'Self' being a persistent liar"
  40,29,"O My people! Yours is the kingdom today, and most eminent are you in the earth. But who will help us against Allah's strike, once it hits us?\" Pharaoh said, \"I want you to see what I see. And I would never show you but the right way"
  40,30,"Thereupon the believer said, \"O My people! Behold, I fear for you the day of disaster that befell prior peoples who banded together (against the Truth)"
  40,31,"The condition of Noah's people, and Aad and Thamud, and those who came after them. Allah never intends injustice for His servants"
  40,32,"O My people! Behold, I fear for you a Day when you will cry unto one another in distress"
  40,33,"A Day when you will turn to flee, having no defender against Allah's Law. And whoever forsakes Allah's Law of guidance, for him there is no guide"
