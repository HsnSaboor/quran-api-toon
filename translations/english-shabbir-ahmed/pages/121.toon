quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,77,"Say, \"O People of the Book! Do not overstep the bounds of Truth in your religious beliefs. And do not follow the errant views of people who have gone astray long before, and led a great many others astray, and those who are still straying from the Even Way"
  5,78,"Those Children of Israel who were bent upon denying the Truth have already been condemned by the tongue of David and of Jesus, son of Mary. This because they rebelled and persisted in overstepping the bounds of what is right"
  5,79,They restrained not one another from violating the Divine Values. Miserable indeed was their behavior
  5,80,"Even now you see many of them allying themselves with the rejecters. Miserable indeed is what they send forth for their \"Self\". Allah is displeased with them and in the doom will they abide forever"
  5,81,"If they had believed in Allah and the Prophet, and that which is revealed to him, they (the People of the Scripture) would not ally themselves with the rejecters. But a great many of them are drifting away from the Truth"
  5,82,"(O Prophet) You will find the most vehement of mankind in hostility to the believers to be the Jews and the idolaters. Closer in affection to the believers you will find those who say, \"We are Christians.\" That is because there are among them priests and monks and because they are not given to arrogance"
