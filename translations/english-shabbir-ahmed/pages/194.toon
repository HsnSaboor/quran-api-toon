quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,41,"Go forth lightly armed, or heavily armed and strive with your wealth and person in the Cause of Allah. This is best for you if you but knew"
  9,42,"There are people among you that if it were a quick material gain and a short easy journey, they would follow you. But the strife and the distance seem heavy and long to them. They will swear by Allah, \"If we could, we would have gone along with you.\" They destroy their \"Self\". Allah knows that they are liars"
  9,43,"Allah pardons you (O Messenger)! Why did you give them permission to stay behind, before you could distinguish the truthful from the liars? (The granting of permission gave the hypocrites an excuse)"
  9,44,"Those who have conviction in Allah and the Last Day, do not ask you for exemption from striving with their wealth and persons. And Allah is Aware of those who walk aright"
  9,45,"Only those ask your leave (O Prophet) who do not truly believe in Allah and the Last Day. Their hearts feel doubt, and in their doubt they waver"
  9,46,"If they wanted to go forth, they would have made necessary preparation. Allah disliked their participation for their reluctance, and held them back. (The Prophet's permission had) said to them, \"Stay behind with those who are sitting back"
  9,47,Even if they had gone forth they would have only caused trouble and run to and fro seeking sedition among you. In your ranks are some apt to listen to them and in your ranks are spies of the enemy. Allah knows the wrongdoers
