quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,14,"Fight them! Allah will punish them at your hands, and He will humiliate them, and give you victory over them, and He will soothe the bosoms of those who believe. (Soothe from the persecution they have undergone for more than a decade)"
  9,15,"He will remove the anger and frustration the believers have suffered at their hands. The invitation is still open to the opponents. Allah, according to His Law, turns to those who turn to Him. He is All Knowing, All Wise"
  9,16,"Do you think that you will be left alone without Allah distinguishing those among you who strive in His cause, and take none for ally except Allah, His Messenger, and the believers? Allah is Informed of all your actions"
  9,17,"Those who associate others with Allah whether idols, religious leaders or temporal leaders, shall not administer Masjids, the Centers of the Divine System. Nor shall those who choose for themselves sects in religion (9:107), (30:31), (72:18). They are bearing witness against themselves in their disbelief (of the Qur'an). All their works are vain and they will abide eternally in the Fire"
  9,18,"Only those people are fit to administer the Masjids, the Centers of the Divine Order, who have unwavering belief in Allah and the Last Day. And, they strive to establish the Divine System, and to set up the Just Economic System of Zakat and fear none but Allah. They are the only ones who are rightly guided"
  9,19,Do you think that providing water to Pilgrims and caring for the Sacred Masjid (in Makkah) is equal to the work of him who has Conviction in Allah and the Last Day and then strives in the Cause of Allah? They are not equal in the Sight of Allah. Allah does not intervene to guide those who displace action with ritual
  9,20,"Those who attained belief, and left their homes, and strove in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives, have a much greater rank with Allah. They are the ones who are truly triumphant"
