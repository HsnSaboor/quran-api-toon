quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,6,This is Allah's Promise. Never does Allah fail to fulfill His Promise. But most people know not (that His Laws never change)
  30,7,"They know and care only about the apparent instant gratifications of the life of this world, and remain oblivious to the Eternal life to come"
  30,8,"Have they never learned to think for their own \"Self\"? Allah has not created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them without Truth and for a Purpose and an appointed time. Yet, verily, a great many of people deny that they are destined to meet their Lord"
  30,9,"(Reflecting on your own existence, the Universe, and on history can show you the Truth.) Have they not, then, traveled in the land and seen what happened in the end to those who lived before them? They were more powerful than these are, and they left a stronger impact on the earth, and built it up better than these are doing. And to them came their Messengers with all evidence of the Truth. It was not Allah Who wronged them, but it was they who used to wrong their own \"Self\". ("
  30,10,"And once again - miserable is the end of those who deal with others unfairly, and since they denied Allah's Messages and ridiculed them (they failed to reform)"
  30,11,"(All this happens to nations according to Divine Laws that are operational in the entire Universe.) He initiates the creation, and then repeats. Ultimately, all of you will be returned to Him"
  30,12,"And on the Day when the Hour will come those who have committed crimes against humanity, will be struck with despair"
  30,13,"Their 'idols' will not be able to stand up for them, rather, they will reject one another"
  30,14,"On the Day the Hour comes, they will part company. And people will be sorted out"
  30,15,"As for those who attained belief and fulfilled the needs of others, they will be made happy in a Meadow of delight. (4)"
