quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,"That this Qur'an is, indeed, a Noble Monograph"
  56,78,In a well-guarded Book. (As conveyed to you)
  56,79,"The Book which none but the pure of mind can touch. (Those who approach the Qur'an with minds contaminated with preconceived notions and extrinsic material, will never understand it)"
  56,80,A Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds
  56,81,"Now, is it this Hadith that you would hold in low esteem? (To uphold some other hadith)"
  56,82,And make its denial your daily bread? (Peddling conjecture as a means of minting money)
  56,83,"Why, then, as the last breath comes up to the throat"
  56,84,And as you look on
  56,85,"And We are closer unto him (the dying person) than you are, although you see not"
  56,86,"Why not, then, if you owe nothing to Us"
  56,87,"Make the departing return, if you are men of truth? (Denying the Fact that Allah alone is the Giver of life and death, and man owes his abilities, limited or abundant, to Him)"
  56,88,"Now, if he is of those drawn near (for having walked aright)"
  56,89,"(For him) Jubilation, and inner fulfillment, and a Garden of Bliss"
  56,90,And thus he is of the blessed ones
  56,91,"So, \"Salutation of Peace be upon you!\" - from the blessed ones"
  56,92,"But if he is of the rejecters, the straying"
  56,93,Then the welcome will be smoldering anguish
  56,94,And scorching heat before the Insurmountable Barrier
  56,95,"Verily, this is the most Certain Truth"
  56,96,"Work hard, then, to establish the Glory of your Lord's Supreme Name"
  57,1,"All things in the heavens and the earth are working relentlessly to fulfill the Divine Plan. And He is the Almighty, the Wise"
  57,2,Unto Him belongs the Dominion of the heavens and the earth. His are the Laws of life and death and He has Power over all things
  57,3,He has no beginning and He has no ending. He is the Evident in His Attributes and the Hidden in His Person. And He is the Knower of all things. (Time and Space are His creation the totality of which is beyond the grasp of human intellect)
