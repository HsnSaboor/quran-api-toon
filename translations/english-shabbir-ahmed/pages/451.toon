quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,But they denied him. And they will certainly be called to account
  37,128,But the sincere servants of Allah
  37,129,And we left for him remembrance among the later generations
  37,130,Peace and salutation to Elias
  37,131,"Verily, this is how we reward the benefactors of humanity"
  37,132,"Indeed, He was among our truly believing servants"
  37,133,"And, behold, Lot was indeed among the Messengers"
  37,134,"When We saved him and his household, everyone"
  37,135,Except an old woman who was among those who stayed behind in belief
  37,136,And then We destroyed the rest
  37,137,"And verily, you pass by their sites by day"
  37,138,"And by night. Will you not, then, use your sense to draw lessons"
  37,139,"And, behold, Jonah was indeed among the Messengers"
  37,140,When he fled like a runaway slave onto a laden ship. ('Abaqa' = Fled like a runaway slave. He migrated before Allah's Command)
  37,141,He had cast an arrow and missed the mark. (Untimely action)
  37,142,"Then the Fish grabbed him while he was blaming himself. (Again, usually a whale is mentioned here. But the whale is a mammal and not a fish, and the Qur'an which is never inaccurate, speaks of)"
  37,143,And had he not been a valiant swimmer
  37,144,(The fish would have eaten him up and) he would have remained in her belly disintegrated there and further until the Day of Rising
  37,145,"(He freed himself and swam to safety.) Then We cast him on the shore, while he was exhausted"
  37,146,We caused him to rest under a well-grown fruitful tree
  37,147,"And We sent him back to his people, a hundred thousand, even more"
  37,148,And this time they believed in him and so We let them enjoy this life
  37,149,"Now (O Prophet) ask them if your Lord has daughters whereas they have sons! (Do they wish to live with superstitions, such as that Jonah lived in the belly of a fish for forty days and then he got free only by reciting a verse, or that your Lord has offspring)"
  37,150,Or is it that We have created angels female and they witnessed it
  37,151,Attention! It is out of their own invention that they say
  37,152,"That Allah has begotten.\" And, verily, they tell a lie too"
  37,153,"When they say, \"He has chosen daughters over sons"
