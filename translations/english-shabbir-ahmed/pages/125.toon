quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,104,"When it is said to them, \"Come to that which Allah has revealed and to His Messenger, they say, \"Enough for us is what we found our parents doing.\" What! Even though their parents had no knowledge whatsoever and no guidance"
  5,105,O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! You are responsible for yourselves. He who goes astray cannot harm you if you are rightly guided. All of you will return to Allah; and He will make you understand all that you were doing in life
  5,106,"(Where necessary, even minor details of Law have been given to you in the Qur'an.) O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! When death approaches you, two equitable persons among you should witness your will. If the pangs of death come upon you when you are traveling far from home, then two equitable persons other than your own people (non-Muslims) may do the witnessing. After you have prayed, let the witnesses swear by God, \"We shall not sell our word for any price, even though it is in favor of a relative, and we will not conceal what we have witnessed before God, or else we will be among the sinners"
  5,107,"If the witnesses commit this very violation, then let two others from among the nearest in kin take their place and swear by God, \"Our testimony (that we have heard from the deceased before) is truer than these two, and we have not transgressed the bounds of right, or else, may we indeed be counted among the transgressors"
  5,108,"This procedure will encourage an honest testimony to begin with. The first witnesses will be more likely to bear true witness fearing that after their oath, the oath of others might be taken. Be mindful of Allah's Laws, and listen. Allah does not guide those who decide to drift away from the Straight Path"
