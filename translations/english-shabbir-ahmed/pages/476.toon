quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,78,"Yes indeed, We sent Messengers before you. Some of them We have mentioned to you, and some of them We have not mentioned to you. And none of the Messengers was given the authority to bring a Message or a Sign but by Allah's leave. But when (the period of respite was over and) the Command of Allah came, the matter was decided in truth and justice. And there and then perished the upholders of falsehood"
  40,79,"(Those who ask for miracles, must know that Allah has placed Signs in the Universe, for example) Allah it is Who has made for you the quadrupeds, that you may ride some of them and from some you derive food"
  40,80,"And you find yet other benefits from them. And that through them you may fulfill your heart-felt needs (of travel, food and milk, labor and battle) - and that you may be carried on them (on the land) as upon the ship (in the sea)"

  40,82,"Have they not, then, journeyed about the earth and seen what happened in the end to those who lived before them? They were more numerous than these, and greater in power than these are, and stronger in the impact they left upon earth. But all that they ever achieved availed them not, and it failed to make them truly rich"
  40,83,"For when their Messengers came to them with all evidence of the Truth, they took delight in the knowledge they possessed. And the very thing they used to mock came on to pay a visit to them. (They took pride in their knowledge and skill and ridiculed the warnings of the Messengers that wrong Systems crash down however smartly they might be run)"
  40,84,"And then, as they saw Our Strike, they cried, \"We believe in Allah, the One God only and reject all that we used to associate with Him.\" (We will dismiss false 'authorities' and submit to the Divine System of Life)"
  40,85,"But their proclamation of Faith could not help them, once they saw Our Blow. This is the Law of Allah that has always applied to His servants. And so, there and then, lost were the rejecters of the changeless Divine Laws"
