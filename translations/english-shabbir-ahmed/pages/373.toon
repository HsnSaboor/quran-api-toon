  26,140,"But, verily, your Lord is Almighty, Merciful. (His Mighty Rule is the Rule of Law)"
  26,141,Thamud also denied the Messengers
  26,142,"When their brother Saleh said to them, \"Will you not walk aright"
  26,143,"Behold, I am a Messenger to you, worthy of your trust"
  26,144,Be mindful of Allah and heed me
  26,145,"I ask you no reward, whatever, for it. My reward rests with none but the Lord of the Worlds"
  26,146,Do you suppose that you could continue in security as it is (with your unjust system) forever
  26,147,In gardens and water springs
  26,148,"And fields, and these palm trees and delicious fruits"
  26,149,And that you will always skillfully carve out of the mountains luxurious mansions
  26,150,Be mindful of Allah and heed me
  26,151,And obey not the command of those who trespass the bounds of justice and equity

  26,157,"But they killed her and made way for their own humiliation. (The usual rendering here of FAASBAHOO NADIMEEN that they regretted, repented or became penitent seems to be incorrect, since in that case the Most Gracious might have forgiven them)"
  26,158,"So, the Retribution seized them. Herein is indeed a sign, yet most people are not believers (in the Law of Requital)"
  26,159,"And, verily, your Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. (He is Merciful that His Rule is the Rule of Law)"
