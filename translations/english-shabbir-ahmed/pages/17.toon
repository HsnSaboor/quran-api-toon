quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,106,"We have not abrogated the old commands without replacing them with the everlasting Commands that are either similar or better than the previous ones ((5:48), (6:116), (15:9)). Do you not know that Allah is the Appointer of due measure for all things"
  2,107,"Do you not recognize that the Dominion of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah? (He is fully Cognizant of your physical and mental needs, and knows the timing of His Revelation). And you have no Patron or helper besides Allah. (Systems of Life designed contrary to His Laws will keep collapsing)"
  2,108,"Do you wish to demand of your Messenger that was demanded of Moses in the past? (People asked him vain questions in minor details and then disobeyed him (5:101)). But whoever changes his stand from the Light of conviction to the haziness of doubt, has already strayed away from the Even Way. ('Iman' and 'Kufr' translated according to the wider meanings and the context)"
  2,109,"Many of the People of the Book wish to make you turn back to disbelief after you have attained belief. They do this because of their personal envy even though the Truth has become manifest to them. (Ethnic and nationalistic prejudices give rise to such feelings of envy (2:111), (5:18)). Pardon them and leave them with their ways until Allah issues His Command. ((5:13), (15:85), (73:10), (74:11)). Verily, Allah has Power over all things and all events take place within the framework of His Laws"
  2,110,"Go ahead and establish the Divine System, and set up the Just Economic Order in the society. And whatever good you send forth to strengthen your 'Selves' in this manner will be stamped on your personalities and you will find it with Allah. (2:3). Behold, Allah is Seer of what you do"
  2,111,"And they claim, \"None will enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.\" This is nothing but their wishful thinking. Say, \"Bring your proof if you are truthful"
  2,112,"Nay, but whoever submits fully to Allah, and benefits people his reward is with his Sustainer. ((7:180-181), (41:40)). And there shall neither fear come upon them from without nor grief touch them from within"
