quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,88,"The arrogant leaders of his community said, \"O Shoaib! We will certainly drive you and those who believe with you out of our town unless you return to our ways.\" Shoaib said, \"Why, even though we detest your ways"
  7,89,"Shall we forge a lie against Allah by embracing your ways when He has rescued us from the wrong? How could we revert to your ways and thus violate the Will of Allah, our Sustainer? Our Lord encompasses all things in Knowledge, (and He knows what is right and what is wrong). In Allah do we put our trust. O Our Lord! Make the Truth triumph between our people and us. You are the best Exponent of the Truth"
  7,90,"But the disbelieving chiefs of his nation said, \"O People! If you follow Shoaib, then truly we will be ruined (as we lose the big profits in our trade)"
  7,91,"A tremendous earthquake seized them and the morning found them dead in their homes, on the ground"
  7,92,"Those who denied Shoaib became as though they had never lived there. Those who denied Shoaib, were the losers"
  7,93,"(The Prophet of God had been forewarned of the oncoming catastrophe and he moved out into the valley along with his followers.) As he was leaving, he said, \"O My people! I delivered my Lord's Messages to you and gave you sincere advice. How could I mourn for people who rejected the Truth"
  7,94,"We sent no Prophet to a community without Our Law of Requital trying them with adversity and tribulation for their wrongdoings, so that they become humble"
  7,95,"Then We changed their plight for good till they became affluent. Then they said, \"(Hardships and prosperity are just a matter of chance). Even our parents and forefathers have gone through these ups and downs.\" Our Requital seized them when they least expected it. (To them it appeared sudden, but unjust systems insidiously move towards the consequences)"
