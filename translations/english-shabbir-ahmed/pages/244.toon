quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  12,70,"As the camels were loading, one of the brothers hid the drinking-cup in Benjamin's saddlebag (12:77), (12:83), (12:89). Then a caller cried, \"O Camel-riders! You are thieves!\" (The Qur'an here corrects the statement in Genesis that it was Joseph who placed the cup in their pack)"
  12,71,"They said, coming towards them, \"What is it that you have lost"
  12,72,"They said, \"We have lost the King's cup, and whoever produces it shall have an extra camel-load, and I (the chief royal servant) guarantee that"
  12,73,"They explained, \"By God! Well you know that we did not come here to create mischief in the land, and we are no thieves"
  12,74,"The callers asked, \"What shall be the penalty for it if you prove liars"
  12,75,"The brothers replied, \"The penalty for it! He in whose bag the cup is found he shall be the penalty for it. (The thief belongs to you). Thus we requite the doers of such wrong (in our land)"
  12,76,They were brought before Joseph for the search. He began with the bags of his half-brothers before the bag of his brother (Benjamin). And finally extracted the cup out of his brother's bag. We thus perfected the plan for Joseph. He could not have detained his brother under the King's law. But that was the Will of Allah. We raise people in ranks according to Our Laws. And above every person of knowledge there is One who knows all
  12,77,"The brothers said, \"If he stole, so did his brother in the past.\" Joseph stayed quiet, revealing nothing. He only said in his heart, \"You are in worse case, and Allah is the Best Knower of what you allege"
  12,78,"They said to Joseph, \"O Noble one! He has an aged father, so take one of us instead of him. We see that you are a doer of good"
