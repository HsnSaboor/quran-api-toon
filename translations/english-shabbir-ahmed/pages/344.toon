  23,30,"Behold, herein are Messages indeed, for Our Law keeps testing nations (for viability)"
  23,31,(And after those people of old) We gave rise to new generations
  23,32,"And always We sent to them a Messenger of their own. (Without exception each of these Messengers said), \"Serve Allah. You have no god other than Him. Will you not then be mindful of Him and walk aright"
  23,33,"(And invariably) it was their leaders who refused to acknowledge the Truth and denied the Meeting in the Hereafter. Simply because We had granted them ease and plenty in their worldly life.

  23,42,Then after them We brought forth other generations
