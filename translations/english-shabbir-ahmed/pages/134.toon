quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,53,"We thus let people distinguish one another's egos. The elite among them say, \"Are these the people among us whom Allah has favored?\" But, is not Allah best Aware of the appreciative"
  6,54,"When those who believe in Our Revelations come to you, say, SALAMUN ALAIKUM (Peace be upon you!) Your Lord has decreed for Himself Mercy. Thus anyone among you who commits a bad deed out of ignorance, and then repents and makes amends should know that He is Forgiving, Merciful"
  6,55,"We explain Our Laws to distinguish (between minor, unintended violations and) the way of the criminals who steal the fruit of others' labor"
  6,56,"Say, \"I am forbidden to worship and obey on whom you call instead of Allah.\" Say, \"I will not follow your desires, otherwise I will go astray and not be among the rightly guided"
  6,57,"Say, \"I have a manifest Proof from my Lord that you deny. I do not control the retribution you challenge me to bring. Judgment belongs to none but Allah. And no one has the Ultimate Rule. He declares the Truth and He is the Best of deciders"
  6,58,"Say, \"If the ultimate decision you are hastening for was up to me, the case would have been already decided. Allah is best Aware of the wrongdoers"
  6,59,"With Him are the keys of the Unseen. (None but He knows the subtle processes and their stages where actions culminate into their logical outcome). He knows everything in the land and in the sea. Not even a leaf falls without His knowledge. Neither is there a grain in the dark depths of the soil, nor anything fresh or withered, that He knows not. But all is written in the Open Book of the Universe around you"
