  29,39,"And such is the story of Qaroon (Korah) and Pharaoh and Haman! (They represented wealth, tyranny and priesthood, respectively, that go hand in hand in exploiting people). To them had come Moses with all evidence of the Truth, but they remained arrogant in the land. And surely, they could not escape. ("
  29,40,"For, every one of them We took to task for his trailing behind in human virtue. And so, upon some of them We let loose a deadly storm wind; and some of them were overtaken by a sudden blast; and some of them We caused to be swallowed by the earth; and some of them We caused to drown. And it was not Allah who wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves. (The Law of Requital never discriminates between people, whether individuals or nations)"
  29,41,"The likeness of those who choose patrons other than Allah, is that of the spider which makes for itself a house. And, behold, the frailest of all houses is the spider's house, if they would make use of what they know. (Its web easily traps the weak but cannot withstand the least bit of pressure)"
  29,42,"Verily, Allah knows whatever they call upon instead of Him - for, He is Almighty, Wise"

  29,45,"(O Prophet) convey to people all that is revealed to you of the Book, and establish the Divine System. For, verily, establishment of the Divine System will shut off lewdness, stinginess and behavior contrary to the Divine Values. This is so, because Allah's Law is the Greatest Law that can give you eminence. And (O People) Allah knows whatever you contrive on your own. (21:10), (21:24), (23:70), (43:43-44), (70:21-27) - 'Fahasha' includes miserliness and 'Munkar' is all behavior that goes against Divine Values given in the Qur'an"
