quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,"Then, of what avail will be their past enjoyments"
  26,208,(It is Our Law that) We never annihilated a township but it had its Warners
  26,209,"Reminder! Therefore, this (Qur'an) is. We are never unjust"
  26,210,"Gabriel has come down with it (26:193).) It is not something that the mischievous diviners and clairvoyants bring"
  26,211,"It is beyond their stature, nor is it in their power"
  26,212,"(Soothsayers, diviners, fortunetellers etc., unless they reform), They are banished from hearing and understanding the Revelation. (15:17-18),"
  26,213,"Hence, (O Human) Call not any other deity with Allah, or you will be of the doomed"
  26,214,And warn first those who are close to you
  26,215,(O Prophet) Lower your wing in kindness to those who believe and follow you
  26,216,"To them who deny you, say, \"I am free of responsibility from what you do"

  26,226,And how they say what they practice not
  26,227,Except those poets who believe in the Revelation. They (do what they say and) help create balance in the society. They engage much in the remembrance of Allah. They help create a social order in which oppression is requited and thus prevented. They stand up for human rights. The wrongdoers will soon find out how their plans would be reversed on themselves
