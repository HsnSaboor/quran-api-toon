quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,41,O My people! What is my personal benefit that I call you to freedom from grief whereas you invite me to the Fire
  40,42,"You call me to disbelieve in Allah and accept authorities besides Him, a concept that holds no ground before what I know. On the other hand, I invite you to the Almighty, the Consistent Absolver of human faults and imperfections"
  40,43,No doubt you invite me to that calling upon which is an exercise in futility in this world and in the Hereafter. In fact unto Allah is our return and they who waste their human potential shall be companions of the Fire
  40,44,"Sometime in the future you will remember what I am saying to you now. I commit my affair to Allah, for, verily, Allah is Seer of His servants"
  40,45,And Allah protected him from their evil scheming while suffering was to surround Pharaoh's people
  40,46,"The Fire which they had been warned, day-in and day-out and then faced it (as long as they lived in this world.) And on the Day when the Hour dawns, it will be said, \"Cast Pharaoh's folk into the toughest penalty.\" (7)"
  40,47,"And behold! They will dispute with each other in the Fire. The commoners will say to the leaders, \"Behold, we were following you. Can you, then, take away some of the Fire from us?\" (14:21), (33:67), (34:32), (37:2)"
  40,48,"The leaders will respond, \"Behold, we are all in it together. Verily, Allah has judged between His servants"
  40,49,"And those in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell, \"Ask your Lord that He lighten for us one day of this torment"
