  3,166,"If you suffered when the two armies clashed, it happened according to Allah's Laws. He made it a test for the believers to know their strength and weakness"
  3,167,"And that He might distinguish the hypocrites from the believers.

  3,173,"When people said to them, \"A great army has assembled against you, so fear them.\" But the threat only increased them in their conviction. They said, \"Allah suffices for us and He is the best Guardian"
