quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,107,"(The hypocrites keep making schemes.) They built a Masjid out of mischief and to promote disbelief, and sectarianism among the believers, and as an outpost for those who warred against Allah and His Messenger before. They will surely swear, \"We had but good intentions\", but Allah bears witness that they are liars"
  9,108,"You shall not stand in such a Masjid! (6:160). There is a Masjid whose foundation was laid from the first day on the Secure Way, it is more worthy that you stand therein. In it are men who love to be purified, and Allah loves those who keep clean of division and sectarianism"
  9,109,"Is he who founded his building on the Secure Way of Allah and His goodly Acceptance better, or he who founded his building on the crumbling cliff of \"Shirk\" that topples down with him into the fire of Hell? Allah does not intervene to guide a folk who displace right with wrong"
  9,110,"The building which they have built will never cease to be a misgiving in their hearts unless their hearts be torn to pieces. (A building that divides believers will remain a source of unrest in the hearts of the sectarians till their hearts stop beating). Allah is Knower, Wise"
  9,111,"Allah has bought from the believers their persons and their goods, for (in return) theirs is the Garden. They shall fight in the Cause of Allah, and shall slay and be slain. It is a Promise that is binding on Him in the Torah and the Gospel, and the Qur'an. Who can fulfill a promise better than Allah? Rejoice then in the bargain you have made, for that is the Supreme Triumph. (Deuteronomy 6:4-5, 6:32. Matthew 10:5, 10:39,)"
