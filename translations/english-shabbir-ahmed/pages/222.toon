quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,6,"There is not a creature in the earth but its sustenance depends on Allah. He is Aware of its habitation and of the needs of His creation at every stage (6:99). He carries them from one station to another until the final destination. His Laws are preserved in the Clear Book of Decree, the Divine Database"
  11,7,"He created the heavens and the earth in six stages and established Himself on the throne of His Almightiness. He has Supreme Control over the origination of life which began in water (21:30). Life is a test for yourselves to see which of you leads a balanced life and is best in conduct. Yet, if you (O Prophet), say, \"You will be raised again after death,\" the rejecters of the Truth will surely answer, \"This is clearly nothing but a fabulous delusion"
  11,8,"And when We delay for them the retribution until after the Period of Respite, they will surely say, \"What is keeping back the doom?\" Ah! On the day it actually reaches them, nothing will turn it away from them. And their mockery will completely surround them"
  11,9,"(Those who only believe in the instant gains of this life, are quick to rejoice and quick to despair.) If Our Law causes man to taste Mercy from Us and afterward withdraws it from him, he behaves despairing, thankless"
  11,10,"And if Our Law causes him to taste Blessing after some hardship has visited him, he says, \"Gone is all affliction from me!\" Behold! He falls into exultation and pride"
  11,11,"But those who are steadfast in adversity and prosperity, and work to improve the quality of life for all, behave positively. For them is the protection of forgiveness and a great reward"
  11,12,"Is it then conceivable (O Prophet), that you omit any part of what is being revealed to you (because the rejecters dislike it)? Or because you feel uncomfortable on their saying, \"Why has not a treasure been sent down for him, or an angel come with him?\" You are but a Warner, and it is Allah Who is the Custodian of all things"
