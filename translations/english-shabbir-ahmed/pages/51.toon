  3,10,"Those who reject Divine Guidance, neither their wealth nor their children will avail them against Allah's Law of Requital. They will be fuel for the Fire"

  3,12,"(O Messenger) Say to the rejecters, \"Soon you shall be overcome and then will be gathered together to Hell, a miserable bed to lie on"

Gardens with flowing streams beneath, where they will live forever with spouses of spotless character and the Blissful Approval of Allah. Allah is Seer of His servants"
