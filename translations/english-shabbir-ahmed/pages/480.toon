quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  41,30,"But, behold, as for those who say, \"Our Lord is Allah,\" and then remain steadfastly upright - upon them descend angels, saying, \"Fear not, and grieve not, but hear good news of the Paradise that you are promised. ('Angels descending and saying' = Allah's Laws supporting the steadfastly upright who submit to Allah alone. (3:124-125), (8:10-12), (33)"
  41,31,We are close to you in the life of the world and in the Hereafter. In it (in your paradise on the earth and in the Hereafter) you shall have all that you may desire and in it you shall have all that you ever prayed for
  41,32,"A gift of welcome from Him Who is all-Forgiving, most-Merciful"
  41,33,"And who is better in speech than him who invites people to Allah, tries to grow himself in goodness, fulfills the needs of others and declares, \"Surely, I am one of those who surrender unto Him"
  41,34,"Since good conduct and bad conduct cannot be alike, repel evil words and deeds in a way that is decent. And, behold, he, between whom and you there was enmity, may become as though he was your bosom friend"
  41,35,"Yet, none is granted this quality but those who exercise patience and restraint. And none is granted it except those who become worthy of great happiness and good fortune. This quality can make you outstandingly successful, winning. ('Zu-hazzin azim' = Extremely fortunate, includes the two meanings rendered here)"
  41,36,"(This quality is difficult to attain because Satan, your impulsive emotions and rogue people, will try to instigate you.) Hence, if a prompting from Satan stirs you up into anger, seek refuge with Allah (recalling this admonition immediately). Behold, He is all Hearing, all Knowing"
  41,37,"(Divine Laws help you journey through life in great balance as you see in the Nature). Now among His Signs are the night and the day as well as the sun and the moon. Adore neither the sun nor the moon, but adore Allah Who created them, if it is Him you wish to serve"
  41,38,"But if they are too proud, those who are with your Lord, practically extol His Glory night and day, and tire not. (All things in the Universe are working toward the fulfillment of the Divine Plan)"
