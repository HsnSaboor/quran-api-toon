quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  14,11,"Without exception their Messengers said to them, \"Yes, we are human beings like you. Allah gives His grace of Revelation to whom He chooses among His servants. We work within the Laws of Allah that preclude the performance of supernatural miracles.\" (The right way to attain firm belief is reflecting at the Universe, within our own selves, at the accounts of history, and upon these verses. That is the general approach of the Book). \"Then you can attain the belief whence you can firmly put your trust in the never changing Laws of Allah"
  14,12,"Why should we not put our trust in Allah? Even in the face of your persecution, we walk the path we have been shown, with uncompromising resolve. All those who wish to entrust the results of their actions with someone, must put their ultimate trust in the Laws of Allah"
  14,13,"The rejecters resorted to threatening the Messengers, \"We will banish you from our land unless you join our religion.\" Then their Lord revealed to them, \"Verily, Our Law of Requital will bring low those who try to displace truth with falsehood and insist on running oppressive systems"
  14,14,"And verily We will establish you in the land after them. This reward is for those who recognize My Majesty and My Warning, and thus respect the Permanent Values given by Me"
  14,15,"The Messengers earnestly sought help from their Lord, and every stubborn tyrant ended up frustrated"
  14,16,"Behind every stubborn tyrant, the enemy of Truth, is the Hell of his own making and before him is the drink of distress. (Such people hinder their own development and forfeit inner peace in this life as well)"
  14,17,"How difficult it is to swallow the bitterness of self-imposed failure! A life unlived, a mere survival, neither living nor dead (20:74), (87:13). What a heavy retribution"
  14,18,"Here is a similitude. The works of those who live rejecting the Permanent Values of their Lord are like ashes that the wind blows away on a stormy day. They gain naught for their deeds (13:17). That is the outcome of following trails that lead nowhere"
