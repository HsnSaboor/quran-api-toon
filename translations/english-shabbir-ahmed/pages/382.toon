quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  27,56,"But the answer of his people was nothing but, \"Expel Lot's followers from your town! For, they are people who show off to be pure"
  27,57,"Thereupon We saved Lot, his household and his followers but his wife - whom We knew was destined to remain behind for her disbelief"
  27,58,And We rained a rain upon them. Dreadful is the rain for those who have been warned
  27,59,"Say, \"All Praise to Allah and salutation on His servants whom He has raised in ranks!\" Is Allah Best or the 'partners' people ascribe to Him"
  27,60,"Nay, who is it that has created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water from the sky? And with it We cause to spring forth beautiful orchards. It was never of your doing to make the trees in them grow - any god beside Allah? Nay, they who think so are people who are deviating (from reality)"
  27,61,"Nay, who is it that has made the earth habitable, and caused rivers to run through it, and has set upon it firm mountains, and has set a barrier between two great bodies of water - any god beside Allah? (25:53). Nay, most of them do not use their knowledge"
  27,62,"Nay, who is it that responds to the distressed when he calls out to Him, and removes the distress, and made you mankind inheritors of the earth - any god beside Allah? (24:54-55). How seldom do you keep this in mind"
  27,63,"Nay, who is it that shows you the way in the darkness of land and sea, and sends forth the winds as heralds of His Grace - any god beside Allah? Sublime, Exalted is Allah from all that they associate with Him"
