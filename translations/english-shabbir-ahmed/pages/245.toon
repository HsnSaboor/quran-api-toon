quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  12,79,"Joseph (stressing the circumstantial evidence) answered, \"God preserve us from detaining other than him with whom we have found our property. For, then we would indeed be unjust"
  12,80,"So, when they lost hope, they conferred in solitude. The eldest among them said, \"Don't you know that your father took a solemn pledge from you in Allah's name, and how you failed in the case of Joseph before? I shall not go from this place until my father gives leave or Allah judges for me. He is the Best of deciders"

  12,85,"His sons said, \"By God! You will never cease remembering Joseph until your health is ruined or you perish"
