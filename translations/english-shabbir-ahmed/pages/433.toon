  34,41,"They will answer, \"Glory is Yours! You are our Master, not them. Nay, they used to worship the invisible guises of their selfish desire. Most of them were believers therein.\" (Jinns = Hidden from sight. Generally this term in the Qur'an applies to nomads rarely appearing in townships. It is also used to describe rebellious desire, emotions and fiery temperament like Satan (6:101), (18:50), (37)"
  34,42,"That Day you will have no power to help or harm one another and We will tell the transgressors, \"Taste the doom of Fire which you used to deny"
  34,43,"When Our Verses are conveyed to them in all clarity, they say, \"This is only a man who wants to divert you from what your ancestors used to worship.\" And they say, \"This is nothing but an invented lie.\" Those who disbelieve say of the Truth when it reaches them, \"This is nothing but an obvious magic"
  34,44,"But We never gave them any Scriptures that they study, nor did We send unto them before you any Warner"
  34,45,"Thus too, nations before them had rejected the Message. These people have not received a tenth of the power and wealth that We had bestowed upon them. Yet, when they denied My Messengers, (see) how awesome was My rejection"
  34,46,"Say, \"I ask you to do just one thing: For Allah's sake! Stand up in pairs and singly - and then think! There is no madness in your companion. He is only a Warner unto you in the face of a terrible doom"
