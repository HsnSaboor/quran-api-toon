quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  67,1,"Eternally Blessed is He in Whose hand is the Supreme Kingdom of the Universe, and He is the Powerful Designer of His Laws for everything"
  67,2,"He has created death and life to distinguish for yourselves who would do better. The Almighty, the Absolver of imperfections, has designed this System in His Infinite Wisdom"
  67,3,He has created seven Cosmic Systems in great harmony. Look! No fault will you see in the creation of the Beneficent. And turn your vision upon it once more. Can you see any flaw
  67,4,"Then look again and yet again, and every time your vision will fall back upon you, dazzled and defeated"
  67,5,"And indeed, We have beautified the sky of the world with shining lamps. And made them objects of futile guesses for the satans. (15:17), (37:6-9), (72:8). And for them We have prepared the doom of blazing flames"
  67,6,Suffering in Hell awaits all who thus blaspheme against their Sustainer. What a miserable destination
  67,7,"When they are flung into Hell, they will hear and feel its fury as it fumes"
  67,8,"As if it would burst with rage. Whenever a group is cast in it, the guardians of Hell will ask them, \"Did you not receive a Warner"

  67,10,"And they will say, \"If we really listened and used our sense, we would not be among the dwellers of the Flames"

  67,12,"Those who fear violating the Laws of their Lord even in privacy, for them is the protection of forgiveness and a Great Reward. (They keep in mind that every action has a consequence, even though it may not be immediately apparent)"
