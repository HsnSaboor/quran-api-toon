quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  64,10,"But those who frankly reject, or practically deny Our Messages, such are companions of the Fire. They will abide therein, and how miserable a destination it is"
  64,11,"No calamity befalls but by Allah's Laws. And whoever believes in Allah, he guides his own heart. (Such a person understands that the Divine Laws in the entire Universe are changeless. That forms the basis of all science, and such nations keep improving their preventive and restorative capacities). And Allah is the Knower of all things and events"
  64,12,"Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (the Central Authority). But if you turn away, the duty of Our Messenger is only to convey the Message clearly"
  64,13,"Allah! There is no god but He. In Allah, then, let the believers put their trust. (They know that His Laws never change)"
  64,14,"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Behold, among your spouses and your children may be enemies unto you. (They could create a wedge between you and the Divine Order). So beware of them! And if you pardon, ignore, and absolve their imperfections, then, behold Allah is Absolver of imperfections, Merciful"
  64,15,"Your wealth and children provide you with a test. (If you maintain balance in this life and the life to come, and take good care of them (2:221)), thus with Allah is a Tremendous Reward"
  64,16,"So be mindful of Allah as best as you can. And listen, and obey, and spend on others (your wealth and person). That is good for your own 'Selves'. For, any who is protected from his own greediness - it is they, they who are truly successful"
  64,17,"If you lend unto Allah a goodly loan, He will multiply it for you and will grant you the protection of forgiveness. Allah is Appreciative, Clement"
