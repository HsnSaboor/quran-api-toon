quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"Abraham said, \"And now what is your task, O Messengers"
  51,32,"They replied, \"Behold, We have been sent to a guilty folk who violate human rights"
  51,33,That we may herald upon them a shower of hardened stones
  51,34,Marked out by your Lord for those who have wasted their own 'Self
  51,35,We then brought forth safe all believers that were in town
  51,36,But We found therein none but one Muslim household
  51,37,And so We left therein a Sign for those who fear a painful consequence (of their actions)
  51,38,"And in Moses too! Behold, We sent him to Pharaoh with a clear authority"
  51,39,"But he turned away in the pride of his might and said, \"A wizard or a madman"
  51,40,"So We seized him and his troops, and flung them in the sea, and he was blameworthy"
  51,41,And in Aad! When We sent upon them the devastating wind
  51,42,It spared nothing that it blew on and smashed it to dust
  51,43,"And in Thamud! Behold, they were told, \"Enjoy life for a little while"
  51,44,But they defied their Lord's Commandment. Whereupon the thunder seized them while they looked on
  51,45,And they were unable even to rise up and could not help themselves a bit
  51,46,"And the people of Noah aforetime! Behold, they were a folk who drifted away from the Truth"
  51,47,"And it is We Who have built the Universe, and behold, We are steadily expanding it"
  51,48,"And We have spread out the earth, and how excellent a Spreader We are"
  51,49,And all things We created in pairs and in opposites (such that one complements the other). This system has cause for you to reflect
  51,50,"(Say), \"Hence, Rush unto Allah! Behold, I am a plain Warner unto you from Him.\" (To emphasize the urgency to do good in this unpredictable human life, the word 'say' in this verse is merged within 'Fafirru' = So, flee = Therefore, rush = Hence, go forth now)"
  51,51,"And set up no god or Authority along with Allah. Behold, I am a plain Warner unto you from Him"
