quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,132,"The ranks of all individuals and nations are determined solely by their deeds, and your Lord is not unaware of what they do. (Calling yourselves believers won't help)"
  6,133,"Your Lord is Absolute, the Lord of Mercy. He could replace you with whomever He Will, like He raised you from the generations of other folk.(It is His Mercy that He does Justice to peoples without discrimination, and His Rule is the Rule of Law)"
  6,134,"That which you are promised will surely come to pass, and you can never evade the Divine Laws"
  6,135,"Say (to the opponents O Messenger), \"O My people! Do all that is in your power. Behold, I am working. Very soon, you will come to know for which of us is the ultimate success. Violators of human rights will never be successful"
  6,136,"(How can their program succeed when their belief system and the resulting actions are wrong?) They set aside a portion of Allah's provision of crops and cattle and claim, \"This is for Allah, and this is for our idols.\" But the share of their idols never reaches Allah, and the share of Allah does reach their idols. What an unjust decision they make! (Their priesthood devours both portions of their making, and the poor remain wanting. To Allah reaches what you spend on the needy)"
  6,137,"(At the prompting of the mystics and monks, and in the name of their temples, idols, sanctuaries, and the dead \"holy\" men and women), the MUSHRIKEEN do acts of omission and commission against their own children! They inflict great pain upon themselves and their families in the name of religion. If they followed Allah's Commands, they wouldn't have done it. (Since they take this abuse as a part of their plan to salvation, for the moment), leave them alone with their fabrications (until Reality gazes them in the eyes)"
