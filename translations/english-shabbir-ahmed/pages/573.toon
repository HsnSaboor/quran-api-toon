quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,And some of us have submitted (to Allah) while there are others who are taking a middle course. And whoever submits - such are they who have resolved to get enlightened
  72,15,And those who maintain a middle course (between the Right and the Wrong) - they are but fire-wood for the Hell
  72,16,"(Such was their conversation.) Now, if they take an unwavering stand on the Highest Discipline, We will shower them with abundant bounties. ('Tareeqah' = Layer upon layer arranged in great harmony = Discipline = Way = Course. 'At-Tareeqah' = The Highest Discipline = Divine Revelation. 'Ma' = Water, heavenly blessings = Bounties)"
  72,17,"That We might test them (let them try their own mettle) thereby. And whoever turns away from his Sustainer's Reminder, He will cause him to undergo an ever-increasing torment"
  72,18,"And know that all Masjids are for Allah. (Adoration, prostration, submission is due to Allah alone). Hence, invoke not anyone along with Allah. (9:17). ('Masjid' = Mosque = Places of worship = Collective acts of Prostration = Ways of Adoration = Obedience of Divine Commands = Centers of administering the Divine System)"
  72,19,"Yet whenever a servant of Allah stands up with invitation to Him, they crowd on him in hostility"
  72,20,"Say, \"I call unto my Lord alone and associate no one with Him (I heed no one against His Laws)"
  72,21,"Say, \"Behold, I do not own the power to harm you or enforce enlightenment upon you"
  72,22,"Say, \"Behold, No one can shelter (even) me from (the consequences of violating the Laws of) Allah, nor can I find a hide-out from Him"
  72,23,"If I fail to convey to people what I receive from Allah and make His Messages known.\" Whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, behold, for him is Hellfire, to abide therein forever"
  72,24,"Until they see what they are promised. And so, soon will they find out who is really helpless and counts for less"
  72,25,"Say, \"I know not whether the promise made to you is near or if my Lord will delay it"
  72,26,"The Knower of the Unseen and the future, and He discloses to none His secrets"
  72,27,Except as He wills unto a Messenger whom He has elected. And then He ensures that the Revelation is guarded in his life and after him. (This Eternal guarding is promised for the final Revelation)
  72,28,"That He may make manifest that it is indeed their Lord's Messages (and nothing else) that these Messengers deliver. For, He it is Who encompasses all the Revelation they have, and takes account of all things"
