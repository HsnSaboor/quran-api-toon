quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  14,25,The tree of this Ideology bears fruit in all seasons by Leave of its Lord. Allah gives examples to mankind that they may reflect
  14,26,"And the example of an evil ideology is that of a bad tree that gets easily uprooted from the surface of the earth, and it has no stability. (It is neither firmly rooted, nor reaches any heights)"
  14,27,Allah strengthens those who accept (the good tree of) Divine Ideology in the life of this world and in the Hereafter. Allah's Law sends astray those who displace truth with falsehood. And Allah does everything according to His Laws
  14,28,"Have you not seen those who respond to the blessings of Allah with ingratitude and lead their people to an abode of utter desolation? (They show ingratitude by holding on to Allah's blessings for themselves, and exhort their people to do the same)"
  14,29,"Hell, which they will have to endure, what an evil place to stay"
  14,30,"They set up rivals to Allah that they may mislead people from His Path. (They take \"Imams\" as their authorities instead of the Word of Allah, thus setting up rivals to Him). Tell them, \"Enjoy life while you may, for your sure destination is the Fire"
  14,31,"(O Prophet) \"Tell My servants to establish and consolidate the Divine System and spend of the provision We have given them, on others, secretly and publicly, before a Day comes wherein there shall be no trading of deeds nor friendship be of avail"
  14,32,"(Think about the Source of your wealth and provision). Allah it is Who has created the heavens and the earth, and sends down water from the sky, thereby producing fruit and vegetation as provision for you. And He makes ships and boats to be of service to you that they sail in the sea by His Command, and has made of service to you the rivers"
  14,33,"And makes the sun and the moon, both of them constant on their courses. And committed the night and the day to serve you"
