quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  64,1,"All things in the heavens and all things in the earth relentlessly strive to fulfill Allah's Plan, and manifest Allah's Glory. To Him belongs the Supreme Kingdom, and all Universe is a living witness of His Praise. The Universe itself displays that He is Able to do all things. He is the Powerful Appointer of His Laws and of due measure of all things"
  64,2,"He it is Who created you (and endowed you with free will). Hence, one of you is a denier of the Truth and one of you chooses to be graced with belief. And Allah is Seer of all you do"
  64,3,He created the heavens and the earth in Truth and with a Sublime Purpose. And He formed you and formed you so well with beautiful potentials. And unto Him is the Final Destination
  64,4,"He knows every detail in the Highs and the Lows and He knows what you conceal and what you reveal. For, Allah is Knower of what is in the hearts"
  64,5,"Has not the news reached you of those who denied the Truth in the earlier times, and so they did taste the calamity for their (wrong) decisions? And for them was a painful chastisement"
  64,6,"This, because their Messengers kept coming to them with self-evident Truth, but they said, \"Shall mere human beings guide us?\" And so they rejected and turned away. And Allah was ever Self-Sufficient. For, Allah is Independent, Owner of Praise"
  64,7,"Those who reject the Truth think that they will never be raised again. Say, \"Yes indeed, by my Lord! You will be raised again. And then you will be informed of what you really accomplished. For, this is easy for Allah"
  64,8,"Therefore, put your Faith in Allah, His Messenger and the Light which We have revealed. For, Allah is fully Aware of your actions (how intricately they harm or benefit you)"
  64,9,"The Day when He shall gather you all on the Day of the Gathering, that will be the Day of loss and gain. And whoever chooses to be graced with belief, and helps others, Allah will blot out the imprints of his faults and admit him into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, therein to abide forever. That is the Supreme Triumph"
