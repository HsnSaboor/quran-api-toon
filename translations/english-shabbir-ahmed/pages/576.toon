quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,"For, behold, he thought, and he designed"
  74,19,"And thus he destroys himself, how he designs"
  74,20,"Again, he destroys himself, how he designs"
  74,21,And then he looked around
  74,22,And then he frowned and glared
  74,23,And then he turned away in pride
  74,24,"And said, \"All this is a remnant of ancient magic"
  74,25,This is nothing but the speech of a human
  74,26,I shall soon cast him into Saqar
  74,27,"Ah, what will convey unto you what Saqar is"
  74,28,A Fire that lets not live and lets not die. (Fire of Regret)
  74,29,Visibly written on the tablet of an individual's life
  74,30,Over it are nineteen. (On the tablet of human life are inscribed nineteen patterns of behavior that lead to the Fire)
  74,31,"We have appointed only Universal Laws to be the keepers of the Fire. And We have made their number a trial for those who wish to remain in darkness. This admonition should grant certainty to those who received the Scripture before while the believers shall increase in faith. And that the believers and those who have been given the Scripture shall harbor no doubt to this declaration. And the hypocrites and the deniers may say, \"What means Allah with such an example?\" Thus, Allah lets go astray him who wills to go astray, and guides him who wills to be guided. And no one knows the Forces of your Lord but He. And this Qur'an is naught else than a Reminder to mankind"
  74,32,Nay! The Moon stands witness
  74,33,And the Night when it departs
  74,34,And the Dawn as it shines forth
  74,35,"Behold, this (the fore-going) is one of the Greatest allegories (that the Revolution is coming in all its splendor)"
  74,36,This is a fore-warning for every human being
  74,37,"To everyone of you, whether he chooses to advance or to lag behind"
  74,38,Every person is held in pledge for all that he has done
  74,39,"Except those who have succeeded for being upright. ('Yameen' = A metaphor for righteousness and success. They have actualized their \"Selves\" by doing good to others)"
  74,40,In Gardens they will ask
  74,41,Of those who used to steal the fruit of others' toil
  74,42,"What has led you into Saqar?\" (A Fire that lets not live and lets not die. Fire of Regret)"
  74,43,"They will reply, \"We were not of the Musalleen"
  74,44,"Neither did we feed the hungry, nor did we take part in helping those who had lost their jobs, those whose businesses had stalled, and those whose hard-earned income was insufficient to meet their basic needs"
  74,45,And we were among those who used to say what they did not do
  74,46,"And we used to deny the Day of Judgment and that the Divine System will eventually prevail\" (And that Allah's Law of Requital is totally unbiased and makes no exceptions)"
  74,47,Till the inevitable Truth came unto us
