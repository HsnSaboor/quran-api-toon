quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  39,57,"Or lest he should say, \"Had Allah guided me, I too would have been of those who walked aright"
  39,58,"Or lest he should say, when he sees the Requital, \"I wish I had a second chance so that I could be among those who do good to others"
  39,59,"Nay! My Messages did come to you, but you denied them in false pride and so were you of the rejecters of the Truth"
  39,60,"Saddened in gloom you will see, on the Resurrection Day, the faces of those who lied concerning Allah. Is not Hell the proper home for those given to false pride"
  39,61,"But Allah will safeguard those who walked aright, for their successful journey through life. No harm will touch them, nor will they grieve"
  39,62,"Allah is the Supreme Creator of all things, and He alone determines through His Laws the destiny of all things"
  39,63,"His are the keys of the heavens and the earth. (He has appointed Laws through which the heavens and the earth can be explored). Those who shun His Signs in the Universe - it is they, they, who are the real losers"
  39,64,"Say, \"Is it something other than Allah that you want me to serve, worship and obey, O You the ignorant ones"
  39,65,"It has already been revealed for you as well as for those before you, \"If you fell for idolatry in any form, all your works will be nullified, and indeed you will be among the losers"
  39,66,"Nay, but you shall serve Allah alone and be among those who show gratitude for His Guidance and Bounties by sharing them with others. ('Shukr' = Gratitude = Keeping Allah's bounties open for the benefit of others thus obtaining best possible and collective results. It does not end with just verbal 'Thank God)"
  39,67,"And they (mankind) do not esteem Allah as He has the right to be esteemed. When mankind stand at their feet, His Law will be held Supreme in the human society as it is in the Universe. (As an allegory) on the Resurrection Day the entire earth will be as a mere handful to Him, and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Glorious is He, Sublimely Exalted Above all that they associate with Him. (6:92), (21:20-23), (2)"
