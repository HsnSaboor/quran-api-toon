quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  49,12,"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Avoid much suspicion and guesswork. For, behold, some of such suspicion and guesswork deplete your communal energy. And spy not upon one another, nor shall you backbite one another. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Nay, you would detest it! Be mindful of Allah. Verily, Allah is Relenting, Merciful"
  49,13,"O Mankind! Behold, We have created you male and female, and have made you nations and tribes so that you might (affectionately) come to know one another. Verily, the most honored among you, in the Sight of Allah, is the one who lives most upright. Behold, Allah is Knower, Aware. ('Min zakarinwwa untha' = Of a kind that is male, and of a kind that is female = Male and female = Some of you are men and some of you are women. On this note I find myself in agreement with M. Pickthall)"
  49,14,"The Bedouins say, \"We have attained belief.\" Say (O Prophet), \"You have not yet attained belief, but rather say, 'We have submitted (to the System)', for the Faith has not yet entered your hearts. Yet, if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not diminish (the reward of) any of your works. Verily, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  49,15,"The believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and then, have left behind all doubt, and who strive with their belongings and their persons in the Cause of Allah. It is they, they who confirm their word with action"
  49,16,"Say, \"Do you inform Allah of your religiousness when Allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth?\" And Allah is Knower of all things"
  49,17,"Some people act as if they are doing you a favor by embracing Islam. Say, \"Deem not that your Islam is a favor upon me. Nay, it is Allah Who bestows a favor upon you as He has led you to the Faith, if you be true and sincere"
  49,18,"Verily, Allah knows the Unseen of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is Seer of all that you do"
