quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  38,62,"Then they will exclaim to one another, \"What is amiss with us? We do not see people whom we counted among evil"
  38,63,Whom we used to ridicule. (Are they not here) or is it that our eyes are missing them
  38,64,"Such, behold, will in truth be the argumentation of people of the Fire"
  38,65,"Say, \"I am only a Warner, and there is no god but Allah, the One, the Irresistible"
  38,66,"Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them - Exalted in Might, Ever-Forgiving"
  38,67,"Say, \"That is a Tremendous News"
  38,68,From which you turn away
  38,69,"Say! \"I had no knowledge of the top leaders of the past, and of their disputations"
  38,70,"It is revealed unto me only that I am a plain Warner.\" (To give warning plainly and publicly)"
  38,71,"(The disputations began ever since mankind came into being.) When your Lord said to the angels, \"Behold, I am about to create a human being out of clay. (Angels = Laws in the Universe)"
  38,72,"And when I have designed him, and breathed into him from My Energy (from the Attribute of Free Will) then be submissive to him"
  38,73,"Thereupon the angels agreed to be submissive before him, all of them together. ('Sajdah' = Literally, prostration, is due to Allah alone, hence, the allegorical meaning here)"
  38,74,Except Iblis - he acted arrogantly and denied the Command. (Iblis = Satan = selfish desire of the humans)
  38,75,"Said He, \"O Iblis! What has kept you from being submissive to that which I have created with My Hands? Are you too proud or are you of the rebellious"
  38,76,"Iblis replied, \"I am better than he. You created me of fire while you created him of clay.\" (Emotions are fiery in relation to the cool 'clay' of higher controls)"
  38,77,"Said He, \"Go forth from here, for, behold, you are condemned"
  38,78,And My rejection is on you until the Day of Judgment
  38,79,"Iblis said, \"Then, My Lord! Give me respite till the Day when they are raised"
  38,80,"Answered He, \"Verily so, you shall be among those who are given respite"
  38,81,Until the Day of Appointed Time
  38,82,"Iblis said, \"I swear by Your Honor, I will certainly lead them all astray"
  38,83,But such of them as are Your sincere servants
