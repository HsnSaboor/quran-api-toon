quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  15,1,"L.R. Allah, Aleem the Knower, Raziq the Provider. These are Messages of Revelation, of a discourse clear in itself and clearly showing the Truth. This is Qur'an, a plain reading and a Revelation that explains itself"
  15,2,The time is coming when the rejecters of the Truth will ardently wish that they were Muslims
  15,3,"Let them eat, drink, and enjoy life while hanging on to false hopes (47:12). They will come to know. (If they do not come to the Truth, the Truth will come to them, and they will see it)"
  15,4,And Our Law of Requital annihilated no community or township before the period of respite was over
  15,5,The Law of Respite has no exceptions. No nation can hasten or delay the consequence
  15,6,"And yet, they who deny the Truth, say, \"O You, unto whom this Reminder has been revealed, verily you are mad"
  15,7,Why don't you bring angels to us if you are a man of truth
  15,8,We do not send down the angels except when the period of respite is over. And in that case the rejecters get no further reprieve
  15,9,"Behold, it is We Ourselves Who have sent down this Reminder, and behold, it is We Who shall truly guard it"
  15,10,And indeed (O Prophet) even before your time We sent Messengers to the communities
  15,11,And never came there a Messenger unto them but they did mock him
  15,12,Our Law turns the psyche of the guilty such that they ridicule reform since they are used to thriving on the fruit of others' toil
  15,13,They accept not the Message. Such has been the way of those who went before them
  15,14,"And even if We opened to them a Gate into the Heaven, and they kept ascending through it"
  15,15,"They would say, \"Our eyes are intoxicated. Nay, we are a folk bewitched"
