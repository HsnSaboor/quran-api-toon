quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,What are they asking about
  78,2,About the Great News
  78,3,On which they disagree
  78,4,"Nay, they will soon come to know"
  78,5,"Nay, again, they will soon come to know"
  78,6,Did We not make the earth a cradle for you
  78,7,And the mountains as pegs
  78,8,And We have created you in pairs
  78,9,And We have made sleep so that you can rest
  78,10,And We have made the night as a cloak
  78,11,"And made the day, life. ('Ma'ash' = Economy = Subsistence = All activities of life = The state of living)"
  78,12,And We have built above you seven Cosmic Systems
  78,13,And We have placed a Dazzling Lamp
  78,14,And We send down from the rainy clouds abundant water
  78,15,Thereby to bring forth grain and plant
  78,16,And gardens of dense foliage
  78,17,"Behold, the Day of Decision is a thing appointed"
  78,18,"A Day when the Trumpet is blown, and you come in throngs"
  78,19,When the gates of the sky are flung open. (Mankind learn about the high space)
  78,20,"And the 'great ones' lose power as if they were mirage. (20:105), (56:5), ("
  78,21,"Behold, Hell lurks in ambush"
  78,22,A home for the transgressors
  78,23,"They will abide in it for ages. (Hell is not forever. Allah's Grace comes to rescue the dwellers of the Hellfire (6:128), (11:107), (40:12). While the abode of Paradise is Eternal"
  78,24,Therein they taste not coolness of comfort nor drink of satisfaction
  78,25,Only burning anguish and ice-cold darkness
  78,26,A befitting requital
  78,27,"For, behold, they never hoped to be held accountable"
  78,28,And they called Our Messages false with an adamant denial
  78,29,But We place on Record everything
  78,30,"So, now, taste nothing but increasing punishment"
