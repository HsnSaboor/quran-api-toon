quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  33,63,"People ask you about the Hour. Say, \"The knowledge of the Hour is with Allah alone. Yet for your purposes, the Hour may be near"
  33,64,"Verily, Allah rejects those who reject the Truth, and has readied for them a blazing Fire"
  33,65,"Therein to abide forever, they will find then no patron nor helper"
  33,66,"On the Day when their faces shall be tossed about in the Fire, they will say, \"Oh, We wish we had obeyed Allah, and obeyed the Messenger"
  33,67,"And they will say, \"Our Lord! Behold, we obeyed our clergy and the leaders and it is they who led us astray from the Path"
  33,68,"Our Lord! Give them double punishment and banish them from your Grace.\" (14:28), (16:2)"
  33,69,"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Never be like those who hurt Moses, and Allah caused him to be proven right. He was of great honor in Allah's Sight"
  33,70,O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Be mindful of Allah and speak words straight to the point
  33,71,"He will adjust your works for you, and protect you from trailing behind in humanity. Verily, one who obeys Allah and His Messenger has gained a signal victory. (4:31), (4)"
  33,72,"Verily, We did offer the trust of compliance to the heavens, and the earth, and the mountains and they, being fearful, breach not what is entrusted upon them. Yet man, with his free will, is the only one who breaches this trust of compliance. For, verily, he wrongs himself without knowing it. (Haml = Accept or bear and = Betray the trust - Like Haram = Forbiddingly bad and = Sacred)"
  33,73,"And so it is. (After making the Laws clear, and giving them the free will, Allah holds mankind accountable for their actions). Allah imposes suffering on the hypocrite men and hypocrite women, and the idolaters and idolatresses. And so it is too that Allah pardons believing men and believing women, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
