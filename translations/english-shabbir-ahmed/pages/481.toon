quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,39,"And among His Signs is this: That you see the earth humble (to Command). And behold! When We send down water thereon, it thrills and vibrates with life! Behold, He Who revives it, verily is the Reviver of the dead. For, behold, He has Power over all things. (His Laws can revive the dead of heart and the lowly nations as well)"
  41,40,"Behold, those who distort Our Messages are not hidden from Us. Hence, is he who is cast into the Fire better, or he who comes secure on the Resurrection Day? Do what you will; He is ever Seer of all that you do"
  41,41,"Think of those who fail to see the power in this Reminder when it comes to them! For, verily, it is a Tremendous Scripture"
  41,42,"No falsehood can ever approach it openly or in stealth - a Revelation from all Wise, Owner of Praise"
  41,43,"Nothing is being said to you (O Messenger) but what was said to all Messengers before you. Behold, your Lord is Owner of the protecting forgiveness, and Owner of awesome grasp. ('Ghafarah' = Helmet of armor = Protecting from hurt = Absolving imperfections)"
  41,44,"Now if We had made it a Qur'an in a non-Arabic tongue they would surely have said, \"Why is it that its verses have not been made clear? Why - a foreign tongue and an Arab?\" Say, \"For those who accept it, this is a Guidance and medicine for a wholesome life. But as for those who will not believe (Arabs or non-Arabs), in their ears is deafness, and so it remains obscure to them. They are like people who are called to from afar"
  41,45,"Yes, indeed, We had given Moses the Scripture too (in their language), and it was also disputed. And but for a Word from your Lord that has already gone forth, all disputes between them would have been judged. And, behold, they keep lingering in doubt amounting to suspicion concerning this Revelation as well! (The Word gone forth = The Law of free will (2:256),"
  41,46,"(The Revelation that shows mankind how to grow their 'Self'.) Whoever does good to others does good to his own 'Self', and whoever causes imbalance in the lives of others, hurts his own 'Self'. And your Lord is never unjust to His servants"
