  29,16,"(Over a thousand years after Noah, about the same location in Ur, Mesopotamia) Abraham - when he said to his people, \"Serve Allah and be mindful of Him. If you bring this fact in the realm of your knowledge you will see that it is better for you"
  29,17,"You worship idols instead of Allah and spread false news about their powers. Behold, those you worship instead of Allah (such as the priesthood of the temple), do not own your provision. (If you establish the Divine System), Allah will guarantee honorable provision for you. Then, serve Him alone and be grateful by sharing His bounties with others. Unto Him you shall be brought back"
  29,18,"And if you deny - well, nations before you have denied the Truth (and suffered the consequences). The duty of a Messenger is only to convey the Message clearly"
  29,19,"Do they not see how Allah originates creation, then repeats it? (Think of the emergence of organic matter, its decay and then re-emergence of life). This, verily, is easy for Allah"
  29,20,"Say, \"Travel in the earth and find out how He originated creation. And how afterward, Allah brings forth entirely new forms. Verily, Allah is the Designer of all things"
  29,21,"He requites individuals and nations according to His Laws, and bestows Mercy according to His Laws. And you are obliged to draw consequences from Him"
  29,22,"And never - not in decline and not in rise - can you hope to defy His Laws, and there is no protector or helper for you other than Allah. (In the context of change and evolution, the earth and the sky are here metaphorically applied to the low or high state of nations)"
  29,23,"And thus it is: Those who deny Allah's Messages and meeting with Him - it is they - who shall abandon all hope of My Grace. And for them is an awful doom. (They disbelieve in the glad tidings and in the Law of Eternal Recompense)"
