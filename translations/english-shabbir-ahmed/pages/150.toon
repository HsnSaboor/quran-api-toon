quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,158,"Are they waiting for angels, your Lord, or some physical miracles to come to them? On the Day one of such Signs comes, no person will benefit from declaring belief if he did not believe before. Or who, while believing, did not do good works. (Belief has to be based on Reason and it must lead you to a productive life). Say, \"Keep on waiting (for miracles), we too are waiting (for the results of our efforts)"
  6,159,"(There is only one Straight Path.) O Messenger! Those who break the unity of their DEEN and become sects, you have nothing to do with them whatsoever. Behold, their case will go to Allah and He will tell them what they had been doing"
  6,160,Whoever brings a good deed will receive a tenfold reward. And whoever brings an ill deed will be requited for one. And they will not be wronged
  6,161,"Say, \"As for me, my Lord has guided me to a Straight Path, the perfect DEEN of Abraham, the upright, who was no idolater in any sense"
  6,162,"Say, \"All my duties to the Divine System, the ways to discharge them, my living and my dying are for Allah alone, the Lord of the Worlds"
  6,163,He has no partner. This is what I have been commanded and I am the foremost of those who surrender to Him
  6,164,"Say, \"Shall I seek anyone other than Allah as a lord when He is the Sustainer of all things? No \"Self\" benefits but from its own works, and none bears the load of another. Then unto your Lord is your return and He will make you understand wherein you differed"
  6,165,"He it is Who has made you inheritors of the earth after other nations. And your ranks are determined by your actions. People and nations must create in them the capacity to live with honor (10:14). The real test is what you do with that which He has given you. Your Lord is Swift in retribution. Yet He is Forgiving, Merciful"
