quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,36,"Only those can accept who hear and listen with an open mind (10:100). The living dead will only listen when they use their faculties (2:260), or when Allah will raise them to the second life; unto Him will they be returned"
  6,37,"They say, \"If only a miracle could come down to him from his Lord!\" Say, \"Allah surely has the Power to send down a miracle, but most of them do not use their knowledge.\" (He does not wish to stun the human intellect with supernatural phenomena. He wants people to reflect and use reason)"
  6,38,(There are miracles in the Universe to behold). All creatures on earth and all the birds that fly on two wings are communities like you. We did not omit any knowledge from this Book that was essential to be given through Revelation. All these creatures are part of the Divine Plan and they are together working the Plan of their Lord
  6,39,"Those who deny Our Signs are deaf and dumb, in total darkness. Straying, and Guidance take place according to the Divine Laws"
  6,40,"Ask them, \"If a natural disaster strikes you as Divine retribution, or when the Hour comes, would you call upon others besides God? Answer if you are truthful.\" (You work by Divine Laws)"
  6,41,"Nay, you call unto Him, act, and He removes your affliction according to His Laws. At that time you forget your idols"
  6,42,"We sent Messengers to nations before you. (They compassionately advised their people that the Supreme Law is operative on the earth, as it is in the heavens). When those nations violated Our Laws in their societies, they had to face the consequences. They should have become humble and taken corrective action right away"
  6,43,"But, instead of being humble when Our Requital touched them, their selfish desire led their minds into rationalizing their actions. This is because their hearts had been hardened with arrogance and repeated rejection of the Truth"
  6,44,"They ignored the Message, and persisted in their ways. We opened for them the gates of all things and they kept enjoying life exploiting others (16:112). But the Law of Requital is ever vigilant. Social orders based on injustice and inequities eventually fail. Our Requital then came with stunning speed, and all they could do was, to plunge in despair"
