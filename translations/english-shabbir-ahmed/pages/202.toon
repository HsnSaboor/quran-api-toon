quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  9,94,"They will make excuse to you when you believers return. Say, \"Make no excuse, for we shall not believe you. Allah has informed us about you. Allah and His Messenger, the Central Authority, will keep you under probation. And then you will be brought back to Him, the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, and He will make you truly understand what you were doing in life"
  9,95,"They will swear by Allah, when you return to them, so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone (9:125). They have blotted their humanity and earned the abode of Hell with their actions"
  9,96,"They swear that you believers may be pleased with them. Even if you accept them, Allah does not accept those who drift away from His Commands"
  9,97,"The desert Arabs are more hard in rejection and hypocrisy, and more likely to ignore the Limits that Allah has revealed to His Messenger. Allah is Knower, Wise"
  9,98,"Among these Bedouin Arabs is he who looks upon his spending as a penalty, and awaits a disaster to hit you. (They hope for the Divine Order to collapse). It is they who invite disaster upon themselves. Allah is Hearer, Knower"
  9,99,"And among the Bedouins are those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and consider their spending as a means towards Allah and a means of supporting the Messenger. This will raise their ranks with Allah. Allah will embrace them with His Mercy. Verily, Allah is Forgiving, Gracious"
