quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  72,1,"Say (O Prophet): It has been revealed to me that a tribe of nomads listened, and then they said, \"Behold, we have heard a marvelous Recital"
  72,2,"It shows the way to Enlightenment, so we have come to believe in it. And we shall never again ascribe a partner unto our Lord"
  72,3,And that Exalted in Glory is our Lord. No wife has He ever taken nor a son
  72,4,And that the foolish among us uttered such outrageous lies about Allah
  72,5,"And behold, we used to think that people, whether civilized or uncivilized, would never utter a lie about Allah"
  72,6,And indeed some people of towns used to seek shelter with some of the nomads and increased them in confusion
  72,7,"And they thought as you nomads thought that Allah would never again send forth anyone.\" (As His Messenger, and so, the claimants of the occult sciences would carry on with their deceptions)"
  72,8,"And we tried to feel the heaven but found it well attended by mighty guards and flames.\" (The shining Knowledge in the Qur'an dismisses all conjecture of the astrologers, fortune-tellers, and other claimants of occult sciences)"
  72,9,"(The nomads continued), \"And we used to sit on places listening to the 'heavenly news'. But now whoever listens will find a flame waiting for him.\" (The brilliant flame of Divine Revelation is now ever-ready to torch the conjecture of the astrologers (37)"
  72,10,"And we know not whether harm is intended for the inhabitants of the earth, or whether their Lord wills for them Enlightenment.\" (It remains to be seen how people will react to this revolutionary Message)"
  72,11,"(The nomads continued their conversation), \"And some of us are righteous and others are far from that, and we follow varying paths"
  72,12,"Now we know that wherever we are in the earth, we cannot defy the Laws of Allah nor can we flee to escape"
  72,13,"And as soon as we heard the Enlightenment, we believed in it. And whoever chooses to be graced with belief in his Lord, need not fear a diminished return, nor unfairness"
