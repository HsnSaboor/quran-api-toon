quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,114,"Jesus, son of Mary, said, \"O God our Lord! Help us create the Heavenly System on earth that ensures abundance of provision for all of us. Let there be a happy feast for the founders and the followers of the Divine System. This will be a Sign from You that Your Commands are blissful. Provide for us and You are the Best of providers"
  5,115,"Allah said, \" I will make abundance for you as long as you remain loyal to the System. But, for those who disbelieve afterward, I will punish them as I have never punished anyone else"
  5,116,"On the Resurrection Day, Allah will say, \"O Jesus, son of Mary! Did you say to mankind, 'Worship me and my mother as deities besides God?\" He will respond, \"Be Glorified! Never could I say what was not my right. If I said such a thing, You would indeed know it. You know what is in my mind, and I know not what is in Your mind. You, only You are the Knower of what is beyond human perception"
  5,117,"Never did I say to them except what You Commanded me to say, 'Worship and obey Allah my Lord and your Lord.' I was a witness to them as long as I lived among them. After You caused me to die, You were the Watcher over them and You are Witness over all things and events"
  5,118,"If You punish them, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, You alone are Almighty, Wise"
  5,119,"Allah will say, \"This is a Day when the truthful will benefit form their truthfulness. For them are Gardens with rivers flowing beneath, wherein they will be immortal. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. This is the Greatest Triumph"
  5,120,"To Allah belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything therein. He has Power over all things and events, and He has appointed due measure for all things"
