quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  42,32,And among His Signs are the ships that sail like bannered mountains through the seas
  42,33,"And if He so wills He calms the winds so that they come to a halt on its surface. Herein, behold, are signs for everyone who is patient (in reading the Book of Nature) and grateful (for what he learns)"
  42,34,"Or that He may cause them to perish as a consequence of their deeds, but He forgives a great deal. (The human 'Self' may progress like ships that sail freely through the sea, suffer stagnancy, or perish to a subhuman existence)"
  42,35,"And those who dispute about Our Signs, let them know that they have no shelter outside Our Laws"
  42,36,Now whatever you are given is but a fleeting enjoyment of the life of this world. And that which is with Allah is far better and more lasting - for all those who believe in Divine Laws and trust in their Lord
  42,37,"And desist from actions that most of all drag down the individual and collective human potential, and from stinginess and obscene behavior, and when annoyed, readily forgive people. ((4:31), (53:32). 'Fawahish' = Indecencies, miserliness amounting to shame"
  42,38,"And who respond to their Lord, and establish the Divine System and who conduct their affairs by mutual consultation. And they spend on others of what We have given them"
  42,39,"And who, whenever frank injustice afflicts them, stand up for their rights. (They establish the System wherein the oppressed is helped and the oppressor is requited)"
  42,40,"But requiting evil may become an evil in itself! Hence, whoever pardons and makes peace, his reward rests with Allah. Verily, He loves not the violators of human rights"
  42,41,"And whoever stands up for his rights and defends himself, when he has been wronged, for such, there is no blame against them"
  42,42,"The blame is against those who oppress people, and cause disorder in the earth resorting to aggression unprovoked. They are the ones for whom there is an awful doom"
  42,43,"And, verily, whoever is patient and forgives, behold, that indeed is from strength of character"
  42,44,"And he whom Allah lets go astray has, then on, no protector. And you will see the oppressors when they face the punishment how they say, \"Is there any way of return!\" (Allah lets go astray = People only go astray by defying the Divine Law of Guidance)"
