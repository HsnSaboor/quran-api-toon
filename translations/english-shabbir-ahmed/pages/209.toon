quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,7,"Those who expect not to meet Us, and content themselves with the petty delights of the worldly life, do not look beyond it, and neglect Our Messages"
  10,8,Their home will be the Fire that they have earned (ignited) with their own actions
  10,9,"Those who attain to faith, and help people, their Lord guides them by their conviction (that no action goes waste). He shows and walks them the way to the Gardens of delight, beneath which rivers flow"
  10,10,"Their prayer therein will be, \"Glory be to You, O Allah!\" Their greeting to one another will be, \"Peace!\" The conclusion of their prayer will be, \"Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds!\" (And so shall be the peaceful Ideal Society on earth. They will realize that the good of one is the good of another and see how Praiseworthy the Giver of such Blissful Guidance is)"
  10,11,"If Allah hastened requital for people as they hasten for immediate delights, their respite would have already expired. (It is Allah's Mercy that His Law of Requital does not grasp them instantly. He gives them time to mend their ways). Those who do not entertain the hope of meeting with Us, We leave them wandering in their rebellion"
  10,12,"When affliction befalls man, he cries unto Us, whether he be lying, or sitting or standing. But when We have relieved him of the affliction, he goes his way as if he had never cried unto Us for what afflicted him. Those who trespass the Divine Laws, lose discernment and even their ill deeds then seem fair to them"
  10,13,"We annihilated many nations before you for their violation of human rights. Their Messengers had come to them with clear evidence of the Truth, but they refused to believe them. Thus do We reward those who steal the fruit of others' labor"
  10,14,"Now, We have made you their successors in the land, to behold how you behave"
