quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  68,16,We shall brand such a person with manifest disgrace! ('Branding the snout' alludes to bringing to visible disgrace a person who chooses to live at the subhuman level)
  68,17,"Behold, We have tried such people as We tried the owners of the garden who swore that they would pluck its fruit in the morning"
  68,18,And made no exception (for the needy poor)
  68,19,Then a tornado from your Lord struck it while they slept
  68,20,"So that by the morning it was barren, bleak"
  68,21,"Now, in the morning, they called out unto one another"
  68,22,Go early to your field if you want to pick the fruit
  68,23,So they went off whispering unto one another
  68,24,Let not a single poor come near you today
  68,25,And early they went strong in their resolve (to keep the poor away)
  68,26,"But when they saw it, they said, \"Behold, we have lost our way"
  68,27,"(Then they realized), \"Ah! Now we are destitute"
  68,28,"Said the most balanced among them, \"Did I not tell you - why did you not work aright (thinking of the poor)?\" ('Sabh' = Swim in strides = Work hard = Labor for a noble cause)"
  68,29,"They said, \"Glorified is our Lord! Verily, it is we who have been offenders.\" (Refusing the Divine Right of the needy)"
  68,30,"And then they confronted one another, blaming"
  68,31,"They said, \"Oh, woe unto us! We were trespassers of goodness"
  68,32,"It may be that our Lord grants us something better than this. Behold, we turn to our Lord affectionately"
  68,33,Such is the suffering! But far greater is the suffering of the Hereafter - if they knew it
  68,34,"Behold, for those who walk aright are Gardens of Bliss with their Lord"
  68,35,"Shall We, then, treat those who submit (to Our Laws) like the guilty"
  68,36,What is the matter with you? How do you judge (the right and wrong and their logical consequence)
  68,37,Or do you have a scripture wherein you learn
  68,38,That you shall indeed get the outcome of your choosing
  68,39,"Or have you a solemn oath, binding on Us till Resurrection Day, that yours shall be all that you order"
  68,40,Ask them which of them guarantees it
  68,41,Do they have 'partners'? Then let them bring their 'partners' if they are truthful
  68,42,"On the Day when they are confronted with the stark reality and they are summoned to prostrate, they shall not be able to prostrate. (It will be too late to submit)"
