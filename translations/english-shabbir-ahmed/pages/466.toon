quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  39,68,"When the Trumpet will be sounded the high leaders and the masses will be stunned except those who are already walking the Divine Path. And then it will sound again, and behold, they will stand in awe seeing the Truth. ("
  39,69,"And the earth will shine bright with the Light of its Lord. And all matters will be seen in the Light of the Book that clearly expounds all things. And the roadmap that the Messengers had come to point out, and the believers kept witnessing to their Truth, will help Justice prevail. And no one shall be wronged"
  39,70,"For, every human being will be repaid in full for whatever he has been doing. (The Justice that is so well expounded in the Qur'an.) And He is the best Knower of whatever they do"
  39,71,"The rejecters of the Truth will be led to hell as communities till they reach it and its gates are opened. The keepers of hell will ask them, \"Did not come to you Messengers from among yourselves conveying to you the Messages of your Lord and warning you of the meeting of this your Day?\" They will say, \"Yes, indeed!\" But at that time the sentence of punishment would have already been announced against the deniers of the Truth"
  39,72,"It will be said to them, \"Enter you the gates of hell to abide therein.\" The time is now to realize how miserable is the destination of those given to false pride"
  39,73,"And those who are mindful of their Lord will be escorted into the Garden as communities till they reach it and its gates are opened. The keepers of the Garden will say to them, \"Peace be upon you! You have done well! Enter, then, herein to abide"
  39,74,"And they will say, \"All Praise is due to Allah Who has fulfilled His Promise unto us, and made us inherit the land. We can live in beautiful dwellings of our choice in this Garden.\" So Bounteous is the reward of the sincere workers! (2)"
