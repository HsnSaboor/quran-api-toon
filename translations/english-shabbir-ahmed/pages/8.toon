quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  2,49,Also remember when We saved you from Pharaoh's people. They persecuted you to the extent that they killed your sons and spared your women. That was a great tribulation for you from your Lord's Law of Requital
  2,50,Thus We parted the sea and rescued you and drowned the people of Pharaoh as you were watching. (This Exodus brought you to the safety of Sinai from the persecution in Egypt)
  2,51,"(Instead of being grateful, you did a weird thing.) While We summoned Moses for forty nights to reveal Our Commandments, you chose the calf when he had gone from you. You were once again relegating the Truth. ('Zulm' = Displace something from its rightful place)"
  2,52,"Then, even after that, We pardoned you and gave you another chance to be practically thankful"
  2,53,"For this purpose We gave Moses a Code of Law, and the Criterion for you to clearly distinguish between right and wrong that you might be led aright"
  2,54,"When Moses returned, he said to his people, \"My people! You have hurt your own 'Selves' (by worshiping the calf (7:152)). Turn in repentance to your Maker and kill your slavish mentality. That will be best for you in the Sight of your Maker.\" Thereupon He accepted your repentance. Verily, He is the Acceptor of repentance, the Merciful"
  2,55,"And recall when you told Moses, \" We won't believe in you until we see Allah face to face.\" (This happened because you had programmed your minds into the primitive ways of the \"age of worship\" when humans could only appreciate the tangible. At that level of intellect, humans come to fear natural phenomena). Thus, when you saw the lightening thunder (and the challenges of life) you almost fell dead in fright. (Losing your reason)"
  2,56,"Then We revived you, and raised you from a dead to a living nation so that you might be practically grateful (by setting up the Benevolent Order)"
  2,57,"(When you mended your ways, and established the Divine System) you saw the cool shade of Our Mercy and We bestowed upon you Our Bounties in abundance, the heavenly sustenance. \"Partake of the decent things We have provided you.\" And they had done no harm unto Us - But they certainly had harmed their own 'Selves"
