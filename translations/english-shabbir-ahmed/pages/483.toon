quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  42,1,"M. Ha-Mim. Hameed the Owner of Praise, Majeed The Glorious"
  42,2,"S.Q. 'Ain-Sein-Qaaf. Aleem the Knower, Samee' the Hearer, Qadir the Almighty, proclaims that"

  42,4,"Unto Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And the Most Exalted, the Tremendous is He"
  42,5,"The heavens above them would shatter (if the Universe were to run like the humans run their lives (19:88-91). But angels (the Divine Laws) practically extol their Lord's Glory by protecting the Order in the Universe. Oh, verily, Allah! He alone is the Absolver of imperfections, the Merciful. ('Malaekah = Angels = Divine Laws in the Universe. 'Yastaghfirun' = They help protect like a helmet protects the head. 'Sabh' = Swim in strides = Doing one's best)"
  42,6,"Now as for those who instead of Him take patrons, Allah is Watcher over them, and you are not a pleader on their behalf"
  42,7,"And thus: We have revealed to you a Monograph in Arabic so that you may warn the Foremost of all towns and those who dwell around it, and may warn of the Day of Gathering, which is beyond all doubt. One group will be in the Garden, and one group will be in the Flames. (Such will happen in this world and in the life to come)"
  42,8,"Now had Allah willed, He could have made all of them one single community. But Allah brings into His Grace him who so wills (making himself worthy). Whereas for the violators of human rights shall be no patron and no helper"
  42,9,"Or have they chosen patrons besides Him? But Allah, He alone is the Patron, since it is He alone Who revives the dead. (And His Laws can revive the dead of heart). He is the Appointer of due measure for all things"
  42,10,"And in whatever you humans may differ, the Decision rests with Allah. (Say), \"Such is Allah, my Lord. In Him I trust and unto Him I always turn.\" ((42:8). Turning to Allah = Turning to His Laws in the Qur'an"
