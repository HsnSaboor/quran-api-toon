quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  20,65,"The debaters asked, \"O Moses! Do you begin or shall we go first"
  20,66,"He said, \"Nay, you go first.\" Their smart presentation appeared to him to put life into otherwise feeble arguments with their logic wandering in different directions. (They were throwing the ropes of falsehood against the Rope of Allah)"
  20,67,Moses feared in his heart that their expertise of playing with words might influence the audience
  20,68,"We said, \"Fear not! Verily, it is you who will prevail"
  20,69,"Present your case with confidence and the sheer power of Truth will swallow all their handiwork. Their fabrication is no more than a scheme of deception. And the liars succeed not against the Truth, however skillfully they design their strategy"
  20,70,"Then down fell the debaters prostrating themselves, and exclaimed \"We have come to believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses"
  20,71,"Pharaoh said, \"Have you come to believe in him before I give you permission? Verily, he must be your master who has conspired with you. I will cut off your hands and feet on alternate sides and then I will crucify all of you on the palm trunks. Then you will know for certain which of us can give the more severe and the more lasting punishment, (the Lord of Moses or me)"
  20,72,"They answered, \"Never shall we choose you above the clear evidence of the Truth that has come to us, nor prefer you over Him Who brought us into being! So issue whatever decree you will. Your judgment can only touch us in this worldly life"
  20,73,"As for us, behold, we have come to believe in our Lord hoping that He may forgive us our faults. And that He may forgive us for the lies that you had forced us to speak. For, Allah is Best and Most Abiding"
  20,74,"Verily, as for him who shall appear before his Sustainer while he had been violating human rights, for him shall be Hell. He will neither die there nor live. (1)"
  20,75,"Whereas he who appears before Him as a believer who had been doing good to others, such people will have lofty ranks"
  20,76,"And Gardens of Eden (Perpetual Bliss) beneath which rivers flow, therein to abide. That shall be the recompense of all those who have developed their personality. (They have actualized their \"Self\" by helping humanity with their wealth and person)"
