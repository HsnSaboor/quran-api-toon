quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,"Time that flies and has flown, bears witness"
  103,2,"That man is, and has been, in a state of loss"
  103,3,"Except those who have chosen to be graced with belief, do works that help others and exemplify Truth and exemplify perseverance"
  104,1,"Woe unto every slanderer, fault-finder! (He himself does little but spends a lot of energy detracting the doers)"
  104,2,"Whose efforts revolve around gathering material possessions and counting them. (Devoid of a higher goal, he opposes any semblance of reform)"
  104,3,Thinking as if his wealth will help him for forever
  104,4,"Nay, he will be flung into the Shredder"
  104,5,"Ah, what will convey to you what the Shredder is"
  104,6,A Fire kindled by Allah
  104,7,Which originates in the hearts. (And engulfs the hearts)
  104,8,"Verily, it closes upon them. (As they had kept their possessions closed in safes and vaults, and kept all kindness surrounded in the flames of jealousy)"
  104,9,In extended columns
  105,1,Are you not aware of how your Lord dealt with the Army of the Elephant
  105,2,Did He not bring their strategy to utter failure
  105,3,And sent upon them swarms of flying creatures
  105,4,Then you showered them with hard stones earmarked with requital. ('Sijjil' = Inscribed = Marked out)
  105,5,And made them like a field of grain eaten down to stubble
