quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  31,20,"(This was some of the wisdom Luqman was endowed with.) Do you not realize that Allah has made of service to you all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth? And He has lavished upon you His Blessings, tangible and intangible. And yet, among people are those who argue about Allah without exploring the realm of knowledge, without taking the right approach, or a Book giving Light"
  31,21,"And when such people are told to follow what Allah has revealed, they say, \"Nay, we follow that which we have found our fathers doing.\" What! Even though Satan had invited them to the doom of Flames"
  31,22,"Now whoever submits his whole being to Allah and is a doer of good to others, has indeed grasped the Strongest Bond (2:256). And Allah's Laws determine the outcome of all things and actions. (WAJH = Face = Whole being)"
  31,23,"And let not the disbelief of the rejecters grieve you. To Us is their return, and then We shall explain to them all they truly accomplished. Verily, Allah is Knower of what is in the hearts"
  31,24,We will let them enjoy themselves for a little while - but ultimately We shall drive them to a heavy doom
  31,25,"And thus it is: If you ask them, \"Who is it that has created the heavens and the earth?\" They will answer, \"Allah\". Say, \"All Praise is due to God - for, most of them do not know (that His Laws, too, are praiseworthy and worth implementing in your lives)"
  31,26,"Unto Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. (His Law is operative in the entire Universe). Verily, Allah! He is Independent, Owner of all Praise (and the Universe is a living witness to that)"
  31,27,"And if all the trees on earth were pens, and the sea were ink, with seven more seas yet added, the Words of Allah would not be exhausted (18:109). Verily, Allah is Almighty, Wise"
  31,28,"Your creation and your raising again are only as that of a single life cell. Verily, Allah is the Hearer, the Knower"
