quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,13,"Or they assert, \"He has invented it.\" Say to them, \"Then bring a portion of Surahs like this, invented, and call on everyone you can besides Allah, if you are truthful!\" (Or produce one Surah like this (2)"
  11,14,"And if they answer not your prayer, then know that it has been revealed only in the Knowledge of Allah; and that there is no god but He. Will you then surrender yourselves unto Him"
  11,15,"Whoever cares for (no more than) the short term gains and glitter of the worldly life, We shall repay for them their deeds herein without the least reduction"
  11,16,"But (since they did not invest in the life to come), for them is nothing but Fire in the Hereafter. All that they have contrived here is vain, and worthless is all that they did. (Following ones own desires is the inevitable consequence of disregarding the Divine Values)"
  11,17,"Contrary to such people is the one who has truly seen his Lord's Signs in the Universe. Now he has the Prophet as a witness, who correlates Allah's Signs in the Universe with His Messages. And before this, the Scripture of Moses has set a precedent and graceful guidance. (It foretold the advent of the final Messenger; Deuteronomy 18:15-18). Such people will surely attain belief. As for those who league together in rejection of such obvious Truth, the Fire is their appointed place. Harbor not any doubt; verily this is the Truth from your Sustainer. But the majority of mankind do not believe"
  11,18,"Who can be a greater wrongdoer than the one who invents a lie about Allah? (The clergy have always done it with previous Scriptures, and they will do it again (2:79), (3:77), (6:113), (6:138-139), (9:34), (22:52)). Such will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, \"These are they who lied about their Sustainer.\" Oh, verily, Allah's rejection is the due of all those who displace right with wrong"
  11,19,"They are the ones who hinder people from the Path of Allah, and seek to make it crooked. Thus they practically disbelieve in the life Hereafter"
