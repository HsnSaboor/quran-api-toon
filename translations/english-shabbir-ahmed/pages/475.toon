quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  40,67,"He it is Who created you from dust, then from the gametes, then from an embryo, and then He brings you forth as an infant. And then you attain full strength and afterward you grow old - though some of you die earlier. All this He ordains so that you reach a term appointed, and along the way, develop your insight"
  40,68,"He it is Who grants life and causes death. The moment He decrees a thing, He says to it only \"Be!\" and it is"
  40,69,"Have you, then, seen those who contend against Allah's Revelations, and, hence, sway like errant winds"
  40,70,"Those who deny the Book and thus the Message with which We sent all Our Messengers. But, in time they will come to know (what it was that they had denied)"
  40,71,"When they shall have shackles of their own making around their necks, and are dragged in chains of their restricted thinking"
  40,72,"Into the hot fluid (since they were floating from desire to desire), and, then, they become sparks of the Fire of their own making"
  40,73,"And now, they will be asked, \"Where are those whom you made partners"
  40,74,"Besides Allah?\" They will groan, \"They have left us groping in the dark. Nay, rather, we were calling upon what existed not.\" This is how Allah lets go astray those who choose to live in darkness by denying the Truth and thus remaining ungrateful to Guidance. ('Kafirin' = Deniers of the Truth = Those who choose to remain in darkness = Those who are ungrateful for the Divine Guidance = Those who conceal the Truth)"
  40,75,"This is because in your life on the earth you used to take delight in what was not True, and roamed about haughtily with your false doctrines"
  40,76,Enter you the gates of Hell to abide therein. What a miserable abode for the arrogant
  40,77,"Then, (O Prophet) remain patient, for, verily, Allah's Promise always comes True. Whether We let you witness some of what We promise them, or whether We cause you to die, still unto Us they will be brought back. (10:46), (2)"
