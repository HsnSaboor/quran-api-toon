quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  27,45,"And, indeed, We sent to Thamud their brother Saleh saying, \"Serve Allah alone.\" They had become divided into two contending classes (the rich and the poor)"
  27,46,"Saleh said, \"O My people! Why do you hasten to commit evil instead of doing good? Why do you not (mend your ways and) ask Allah to forgive you, so that you may become worthy of His Mercy"
  27,47,"They answered, \"We consider you, and your companions a bad omen for us.\" He said, \"Your omen is determined by Allah's Laws. Nay, you are but a folk who are being tested"
  27,48,"Now there was a gang of nine leaders in the city who spread disorder in the land, and blocked all reform"
  27,49,"They called a meeting and after swearing to one another in the name of Allah, said, \"Indeed, we shall ambush him and his family by night, and afterward we shall boldly say to his tribe, We know nothing about their death. And, behold, we are men of truth"
  27,50,And so they devised an evil scheme. But Our ever-vigilant Law of Requital invariably has counter designs. And they perceived it not
  27,51,"Behold, then, how their scheme ended. Our Law annihilated them (the corrupt leaders) and their nation, all of them. (The excuse of the masses that their leaders had led them astray will be of no avail 14: 21-22, 34:31)"
  27,52,"And now their dwellings are empty, ruined as an outcome of their violation of human rights. Herein, behold, is a sign for those who make use of what they learn"
  27,53,And We saved those who believed in Our Laws and walked aright
  27,54,"And Lot! (We saved likewise) as he said to his people, \"Will you commit this abomination while you see and understand"
  27,55,"You approach men with lust instead of women. Nay, you are people who disregard what you know"
