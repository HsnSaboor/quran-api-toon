  91,1,Witness is the Sun and its radiant splendor
  91,2,And the Moon that borrows its light
  91,3,Witness is the day as it brightens the world
  91,4,And the night that cloaks it
  91,5,And the sky and its wondrous design
  91,6,And the earth and its vast expanse
  91,7,"Consider the human 'Self, and how it is capable for being balanced out"
  91,8,And how it is instilled with the capacity to disintegrate or become secure
  91,9,Successful indeed is he who grows the 'Self
  91,10,And failure is indeed he who keeps it buried (under ignorance and superstition)
  91,11,(Disregarding this principle) Thamud rejected (Saleh) while playing God. ('Tagha' = Being 'Taghut' = Becoming a false god = Playing God = Transgressing = Rebelling = Crossing bounds of decency = Extreme arrogance)
  91,12,"Behold, the most forward among them was picked up for defiance"
  91,13,"Although Allah's Messenger had told them, \"It is a she-camel belonging to Allah, so let her drink!\" (The land belongs to Allah, and this she-camel represents the weak among you (7:)"
  91,14,But they denied him and they killed her. Their Lord then doomed them all alike for their lagging behind in compliance

  92,1,Witness is the Night as it cloaks in darkness
  92,2,And the Day as it shines with splendor

  92,4,"Behold, your effort is diverse. (Your occupations and earnings are different. Let not this be a cause for division among you)"
  92,5,"And so, he who gives and walks aright"
  92,6,And makes his life a manifest image of benevolence
  92,7,We will indeed ease his way to the Ultimate Ease
  92,8,But he who withholds and thinks himself self-sufficient becoming careless of others
  92,9,And makes his life a manifest image of denial of goodness
  92,10,We will indeed ease his way to hardship
  92,11,And what could his wealth avail when he himself falls! (6)
  92,12,"Behold, it is for Us to show you the Way (through this Revelation)"
  92,13,"And behold, unto Us belong the End and the Beginning"
  92,14,And so I warn you of a raging Fire
