quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  65,1,"O Prophet! When you men intend to divorce women, make sure that the waiting period is observed. Keep precise account of this interim. Be mindful of Allah, your Lord. Never expel them from THEIR homes, nor shall they themselves leave their homes unless they commit open immorality. These are, then, the limits imposed by Allah. And whoever crosses Allah's limits, he verily hurts his own 'Self'. You know not that Allah may bring about thereafter a new situation (help create reconciliation)"
  65,2,"And so when they have reached their waiting term, either retain them in kindness or part with them in kindness. And let there be two just persons among you to witness, and establish the evidence straight for Allah. This exhortation is for him who believes in Allah and the Last Day. And anyone who is mindful of Allah, He will always grant a way out for him (from difficult situations)"
  65,3,"And will provide for him in a manner he has not expected. And whoever places his trust in Allah, He will suffice him. Behold, Allah always brings His Command to pass. Indeed, for all things Allah has appointed due gauge"
  65,4,"And such of your women as no longer expect menstruation, as well as those women who do not have menstruation (for any physiological reason), to resolve your doubts, their waiting period is ordained to be three months. And for those who are pregnant, the waiting period ends when they deliver their burden. And anyone who is mindful of Allah, He will make his situation easy for him"
  65,5,"That is the Commandment of Allah which He reveals unto you. Anyone who is mindful of Allah, He will absolve his faults and amplify for him the reward"
