  3,158,"Whether you die or get slain, life goes on to its Destination; you will be gathered before Allah"
  3,159,"It is a Mercy of Allah that you (O Messenger), are lenient and compassionate with people. If you were harsh and fierce of heart, they would have broken away from you.

Allah loves those who do their best and then trust in Allah"
  3,160,"When Allah helps you no one can overcome you. If He withdraws His help from you, who is there who can help you? If you ignore His Laws, His Laws forsake you. Believers put their trust in Allah (since He never changes His Laws)"

He shows them the way to grow in humanity, and teaches them the Book and Wisdom therein. Before the Messenger came to them, they were in flagrant error"
