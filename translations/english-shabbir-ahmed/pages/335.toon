quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  22,24,For they were willing to be guided towards the best concepts and the best ways of expression. Thus they were guided onto the path that leads to the Praised One. (QAUL includes concept and expression)
  22,25,"Verily, those who reject the Truth and bar people from the Path of Allah, and from the Center of Divine Ideology, the Sacred Masjid, must know that We have appointed it for all mankind alike. This is the Inviolable House of worship and security for the locals as well as the visitors (2:125). Whoever seeks to relegate it from Ideology to ritualism, directly or through side cannels, We will make him taste an awful doom. (Zulm = Relegation from the rightful place)"
  22,26,"Behold! We pointed the site of the Sacred House (Ka'bah) to Abraham, saying, \"Associate none with Me, and keep My House clean of human dogmas for those whose Divine Ideology of Monotheism will revolve around this Center for all mankind. Train the visitors to stand up for Truth, and bow to and prostrate before Divine Commands.\" (2:125), (2:197), (3:95-9)"
  22,27,"And announce to mankind the duty of Pilgrimage. They will come to you on foot, and on every kind of fast mount, coming from every far-away point on earth"
  22,28,So that they might see with their own eyes and experience what benefits the Divine System holds for them (in addition to uniting them in the common bond of humanity). And they shall commemorate Allah's Name collectively during the specified days of Hajj; and over the livestock He has bestowed upon them. Then host one another with the livestock (to make the Congregation self-sufficient in the food resource). Eat and feed the distressed poor (regardless of whether they are in the congregation or elsewhere)
  22,29,"As they host one another, they shall consult to clean out their societies of individual and collective vices. And, design ways to fulfill their obligations as human beings. Then they shall walk around the Ancient House in their resolve"
  22,30,"All this is the purpose of Hajj. Whoever will honor these Directives and Limitations, it will be well for him in the Sight of his Lord. The livestock here is lawful food for you except for those already prohibited (2:173), (5:3), (6:145), (16:115). You shall avoid idol worship in any form, and abstain from bearing false witness. Avoid all things that bring your progress to a standstill. Lying, bearing false witness and flamboyant behavior are specifically forbidden at this congregation to prevent nullification of the grand objective (Rijs, Awthan, Zoor encompass all the stated meanings)"
