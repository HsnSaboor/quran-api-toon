quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,163,"We have sent you the Revelation as We sent it to Noah and the Prophets after him. We sent Revelations to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his progeny (the Tribes), Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon; and to David We gave the Psalms"
  4,164,"We sent Our Messengers to all nations with a Uniform Message. We have told you the stories of some in the Qur'an, of the others We have not. (However, all of them were assigned a Common Mission). Allah spoke the same to Moses"
  4,165,"All Messengers gave good news, as well as warning, so that humans won't have an argument against God, after the Messengers conveyed to them the Guidance. Allah is Almighty, Wise"
  4,166,"Allah bears witness concerning what He has revealed to you. With His Own Knowledge He has revealed it. If you reflect on the Order in the Universe, you shall find that His angels, the Universal Laws, bear witness. And Allah is Sufficient Witness"
  4,167,"Those who deny such obvious Reality and try to hinder from the Way of Allah, have wandered far astray"
  4,168,"Those who indulge in such blatant denial and hinder people from Allah's Way, are wrongdoers. They are violating one of the basic human rights i.e. that of attaining knowledge (4:167). According to the Law of Requital, they block their own way to forgiveness and guidance"
  4,169,The only way the Divine Law leaves open for them is the way to Hell. And it is easy for Allah
  4,170,"O People! The Messenger has come to you with Truth from your Lord. If you believe in him, it is good for you. If you deny, know that to Allah belongs everything in the heavens and the earth. Allah is All Knowing, All Wise. (Following His Commands brings you to harmony with the Universe)"
