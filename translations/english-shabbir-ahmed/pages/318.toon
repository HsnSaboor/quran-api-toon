quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  20,88,"Then As-Samiri (experienced in sculpting) made the effigy of a calf. It even brought forth a lowing sound with wind or when blown into. So they said, \"This is your god, and the god of Moses, but he has forgotten"
  20,89,"They knew full well that, like all false deities, the golden calf could not respond to queries, and had no control over their harm or benefit"
  20,90,"And Aaron indeed had told them beforehand, \"O My people! You are being tempted to evil by this idol. Behold, your only Lord is the Beneficent! Follow me then, and obey my order"
  20,91,"They said, \"We will by no means cease worshiping it until Moses comes back to us"
  20,92,"When he returned, Moses asked, \"O' Aaron! What stopped you when you saw them going astray"
  20,93,That you followed me not? Didn't you disobey my order
  20,94,"Aaron said, \"O Son of my mother! Don't get mad at me, nor treat me harshly. I feared that you would say, \"You have let the Children of Israel divide into parties and sects.\" (Moses accepted this explanation since sectarianism is no less a crime than idol worship in any form. Seizing the beard and head pertains to harsh interrogation)"
  20,95,"Moses now turned to Samiri, \"What do you have to say O Samiri"
  20,96,"He answered, \"I have gained insight into something which they have not. So I took hold of a handful of the Messenger's teachings and cast it away. This is what my mind prompted me to do"
  20,97,"Moses said, \"Go away then, for good! In this life it is for you to say, \"Touch me not!\" And moreover you have a promise that will not fail. (People will consider and treat you as untouchable as before, and the suffering of the Hereafter is inescapable). Now, look at your god to whom you were so devoted. Verily, We will burn it and scatter its ashes far and wide over the sea.\" (Moses wanted his people to behold the powerlessness of the false deities and their potential to divide humanity)"
  20,98,"Moses continued addressing his people, \"Your God is only Allah; there is no god but He. He embraces all things in His Knowledge"
