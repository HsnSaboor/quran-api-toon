  34,23,"No intercession is of any avail with Him except that one stands up as a witness of Law in His Court. When their hearts are calmed down, they will ask, \"What did your Lord decide?\" The witnesses will say, \"The decisive Truth.\" He is the Most High, Most Great"
  34,24,"Say, \"Who grants you provision from the heavens and the earth?\" Say, \"Allah\" and see for yourself who is rightly guided and who is in error, we or you?\" (You wish to keep the God-given resources unto yourselves and we insist on an equitable distribution)"
  34,25,"Say, \"You will not be asked of our wrongs, nor shall we be called to account for what you are doing"
  34,26,"Say, \"Our Lord will bring us all together, then He will lay open the Truth between us. Verily, He is the Exponent of truth, All-Knowing"
  34,27,"Say, \"Point out to me those whom you associate with Him as partners. Nay - nay, but He alone is God, the Almighty, the Wise"
  34,28,"Now (O Messenger) We have sent you as a bringer of glad news and a Warner to mankind at large, but most people are (at this time) unaware of this fact"

  34,30,"Say, \"The promise of the Day that you can neither postpone nor hasten by an hour, is yours"
  34,31,"And the rejecters say, \"We will not believe in this Qur'an, nor in the previous Scriptures.\" If you could only see these transgressors when they are made to stand before their Lord, how they blame one another. The followers will tell their proud leaders, \"If it were not for you, we would have been believers"
