quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Have you seen the kind of person who denies Our Messages and says, \"Surely, I will be given wealth and children.\" (He fails to realize that there is more to life than these blessings)"
  19,78,Do they know the realm of the Unseen? Have they taken a promise from the Beneficent
  19,79,"Nay, We shall record what he says, and prolong for him a span of torment"
  19,80,"To Us shall return all that he talks of, and he shall appear before us in a lonely state"
  19,81,"And they have chosen idols in various forms besides Allah, hoping that they would be a source of strength for them"
  19,82,"But nay, they will reject their worship, and will turn against them"
  19,83,Are you not aware that Our Law unleashes all satanic forces upon the rejecters to impel them in fury against the Truth
  19,84,"So make no haste against them, for We mark the number of their days"
  19,85,"On the Day when We shall gather the righteous unto Us, the Beneficent, like a delegation presented for honors"
  19,86,And drive the violators of human rights unto Hell as a thirsty herd is driven to a well
  19,87,None will have the benefit of intercession unless he has entered into a bond with the Beneficent during the life of the world
  19,88,"As it is, some assert, \"The Beneficent has betaken a son"
  19,89,"Indeed, you have put forth something monstrous"
  19,90,"Whereby almost the heavens are torn, and the earth is split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins"
  19,91,That men should ascribe a son to the Most Gracious
  19,92,It is not befitting for the Majesty of the Beneficent that He should choose a son
  19,93,There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes to the Beneficent as a servant
  19,94,"Indeed, He fully knows them, and has counted them one by one"
  19,95,And each of them will come to Him singly on the Resurrection Day
