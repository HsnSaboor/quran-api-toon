quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,74,"Remember when Abraham said to his father Azar (Terah), \"How could you worship idols as gods? I see you and your people are in obvious error.\" (Azar is called Terah in the Bible and Zarah in Talmud)"
  6,75,"We gave Abraham insight, the ability to reflect, into the Mighty Dominion of the Universe so that he might attain firm conviction"
  6,76,"(Some of his people were idolaters and others were Nature worshipers.) One night when it grew dark upon him he saw a star. Abraham exclaimed to them, \"This is my Lord!\" But when it went down, he said, \"I love not the things that go down"
  6,77,"(The other night) when the moon was rising, he exclaimed, \"This is my Lord.\" But when it went down, he said to himself and to the people, \"Unless my Lord guides me, I surely will go astray"
  6,78,"(In the morning) he saw the sun rising in splendor, and he said, \"This is my Lord! This is greater!\" But, as the sun went down, Abraham exclaimed, \"O My people! I am free from all that you associate with God"
  6,79,I have focused firmly on Him Who initiated the heavens and the earth; as an upright man I turn away from all that is false. I will never be an idol worshiper in any form
  6,80,"His people argued with him, but Abraham said, \"You dispute with me about Allah when He has guided me? I have no fear of the idols you set up. Nothing can happen to me contrary to the Laws of Allah. My Lord's Knowledge encompasses all things. Will you not then, use your intellect?\" (This is how Abraham tried that his people reflect and be rational)"
  6,81,"He said, \"Why should I fear that which you set up beside Him, when you fear not to set up beside Allah, deities for which He has sent no authority and that are utterly powerless. Think which of the two sides among us deserves peace and security? (3:150-151), (29:41), (33:39) Answer me if you have the answer"
