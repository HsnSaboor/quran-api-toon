quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  35,4,"(O Messenger) if they deny you, Messengers before you were also denied. But all affairs ultimately end up in His Court"
  35,5,"O Mankind! Indeed Allah's Promise is true. (The Law of Requital is an inevitable reality). So let not the present life deceive you, nor let the Deceiver deceive you about Allah. (Deceiver = Satan = Selfish desire. Also misguided people and their propaganda)"
  35,6,"Behold, Satan is a foe unto you; so treat him as a foe. He only calls his party to become companions of the Blazing Fire"
  35,7,"For those who are bent on rejecting the Truth, is a severe retribution. And for those who accept the Truth and work for the welfare of others, is the protection of forgiveness and a great reward"
  35,8,"Can you think of he whose persistence in evil blunts his sensitivity - so that his deeds seem fair to him? Verily, Allah lets go astray any who wants to go astray, just as He guides any who wants to be guided. Therefore, waste not yourself in sorrowing over them. Verily, Allah is Aware of all that they contrive"
  35,9,And Allah it is Who sends the winds and they raise a cloud; then We lead it unto a dead land and revive the earth after it had been lifeless. Thus is the Resurrection (and revival of individuals and nations with Divine Guidance)
  35,10,"Whoever desires dignity should know that to Allah belongs all Dignity. Unto Him ascend all good words, and He exalts the works that help others. (That is how individuals and nations can ascend in honor). But those who plot imbalance in the lives of others, for them is severe punishment and their plotting, in the end, will come to naught"
  35,11,"(Recall your common humble origin.) Allah created you from dust, then from male and female gametes, and then He makes you pairs. And no female becomes pregnant, nor gives birth without His Knowledge (according to His Appointed Science, without exceptions). No one lives long, and no one lives short, but by His Law (3:144). Behold, all this is easy to Allah. ('Nutfah' = Gamete, male or female)"
