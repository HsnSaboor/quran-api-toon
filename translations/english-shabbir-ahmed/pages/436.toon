quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  35,12,"(Observe the diversity in Nature.) Thus the two seas (and subsoil waters) are not alike. One is fresh, good to drink, the other undrinkable, salty (25:53). Yet, from either of them you eat tender meat and extract ornament that you may wear. And you see ships sailing through the waves seeking His Bounty, so that you may have cause to be grateful"
  35,13,"He makes the night grow longer by shortening the day, and makes the day grow longer by shortening the night. And He has committed the sun and the moon to service, each running to an appointed term. Such is Allah, your Lord - unto Him belongs all Dominion. And those whom you call upon instead of Him, do not own so much as the husk of a date-stone. ("
  35,14,"When you call them (the dead 'saints'), they don't even hear your call, and even if they were to hear they won't be able to respond to you. On the Day of Resurrection they will disown your 'partnership'. And none can inform you like the One Who is Aware"
  35,15,"O Mankind! It is you who stand in need of Allah. And Allah! He is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise"
  35,16,"If He Will, He can do away with you and bring some new creation"
  35,17,This is not at all difficult for Allah
  35,18,"And no person, being already burdened with his own doings, will be made to carry the burden of another. And if a laden one calls for help with his load, none may carry part of it even if he is a close relative. Hence, you can warn only those who understand their Lord's Law of Requital knowing that even their actions done in secrecy have consequences. So, such people follow the Divine Commands closely. Whoever grows in virtue does so for the good of his \"Self\". And the destination of all is to Allah"
