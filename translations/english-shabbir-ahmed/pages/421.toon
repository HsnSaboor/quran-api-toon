  33,24,"That Allah may reward the truthful for having been true to their word, and cause the hypocrites to suffer - or accept their repentance according to His Laws. Verily, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"

  33,26,"Those People of the Scripture who allied with the clans (despite having a treaty with you), have been taken out from their forts and strongholds, and panic has struck their hearts.

Tell your wives, \"If you desire the life of this world and its glitter - well, then, I shall provide you to your contentment and let you go in a becoming manner.\" (The Prophet had chosen not to keep a standard of living higher than the poorest of Madinah, and the mothers of believers were seeing other women living in relative affluence)"
  33,29,"But if you desire Allah and His Messenger, and the Home of the Hereafter, then, verily, Allah has prepared for the benevolent among you an immense reward"
  33,30,"O Wives of the Prophet! (You will be seen as role models for other women, therefore), if any of you displays unseemly conduct, double would be her suffering, for indeed, that is easy for Allah"
