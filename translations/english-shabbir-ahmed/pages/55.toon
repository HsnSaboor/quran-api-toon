quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,38,"Seeing a lovely child grow before his eyes, Zechariah prayed to his Lord, \"My Lord! Bless me by bestowing upon me a good child; You are the Hearer of prayer"
  3,39,"While he was still praying in the chamber, angels announced to him, \"Allah gives you the good news of a son, Yahya (John the Baptist) who would reiterate the Word of Allah, be outstanding among men, and a strict disciplinarian, and a Prophet among those who greatly contribute to humanity"
  3,40,"Zechariah prayed to Allah, but then wondered, \"My Lord! How could I have a son when old age has overtaken me already and my wife is barren?\" He said, \"So it will be, Allah does everything according to His Laws.\" The infertility in his wife was cured"
  3,41,"Thankful, Zechariah asked, \"My Lord! Give a message unto me.\" He said, \"The Message unto you is that you shall not speak to people three days, except by signs. Remember your Lord much and keep striving in His Cause night and day.\" (Abstaining from speech would save the elderly couple from people's curiosity)"
  3,42,"(Mary kept a spotless character as she grew up into a young lady). Angels told her, \"Allah has chosen you, given you spotless character and given you distinction among the women of your times.\" (She guarded her chastity and built a strong character in very adverse circumstances. Many monks and devotees of temples used to see the nuns with evil intentions. She was the first revolutionary feminine voice against the exploitations of monasteries)"
  3,43,"She was told by angels to gather courage, quit monasticism, submit to the Command of her Lord and join her family for normal life bowing to the design of life Allah has ordained for people"
  3,44,(O Messenger) We are revealing to you these events of history so that you may dispel conjecture and rumor. You were not there when the monks cast lots and contended with one another to take hold of (the young beautiful) Mary after Zechariah
  3,45,"Angels said, \"O' Mary! Allah gives you the good news through a word from Him. His name would be Christ Jesus, son of Mary, held in honor in this world and among the ones close to Me in the Hereafter"
