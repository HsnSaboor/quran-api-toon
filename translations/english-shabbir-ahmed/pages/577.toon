quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,Then no mediation of any mediator will help
  74,49,"What, then, is the matter with them that they are turning away from a clear Advisory"
  74,50,As if they were frightened zebras
  74,51,Fleeing from a lion
  74,52,"Nay, each of them wants to be given the scrolls of Revelation personally, unfolded (and spoon-fed)"
  74,53,"Nay, verily, they are oblivious to the Law of Cause and Effect - that every action has its ultimate consequence"
  74,54,"Nay, behold, this is a clear Advisory"
  74,55,So whoever wills may take it to heart
  74,56,"But they will not take it to heart except in accordance with Allah's Law of Guidance. (4:88). He is the Source of security, and the Source of forgiveness and protection. (7)"
  75,1,Nay! I call to witness the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,"Nay, I call to witness the person who shows remorse after wrongdoing. (12:53. Notice the Law taking the first step instantly)"
  75,3,"Does the human being think that We will not assemble his bones? ((36:78), (37:16). Life goes on without its essence, the 'Self', undergoing disintegration"
  75,4,"Yes indeed, Yes, We have the Power to restore even his finger tips with finger prints"
  75,5,But man is after subverting his own future
  75,6,"(Yet) he asks, \"When will this Day of Resurrection be"
  75,7,But when the sight is dazzled
  75,8,And the moon is darkened. (The banner of the Age of Ignorance bearing the moon logo goes down)
  75,9,And the sun and the moon are brought together. (Persia and Arabia come under one Rule. Sun being the logo on the Persian banner)
  75,10,"On that Day man will wonder, \"Where to flee!\" (In this life and in the life to come. Verses 7-10 could easily allude to the merging of the super power of the times, Persia with the newly enlightened Arabia in 642 C.E., 10 years after the exalted Prophet's death)"
  75,11,"But, nay! No height to mount above the turmoil"
  75,12,Unto your Lord that Day is the resting place
  75,13,On the Day when man is apprised of all his acts of commission and omission. (All he has done and left undone. All deeds that advanced him and kept him behind)
  75,14,"Oh, but man is a telling witness against himself"
  75,15,Even though he were to put forward all his excuses
  75,16,(Now whenever you read the verses of the Qur'an) read not in haste stirring your tongue
  75,17,"Behold, it is up to Us to gather it (in your heart) and the reading of it. (He will bless whatever effort we put into learning it)"
  75,18,"Thus, when We read it, follow you the reading. (Allah has revealed the Qur'an, and bestowed upon us the faculty of understanding, hence, \"When We read it)"
  75,19,"Then, behold! It is for Us to explain it. (The Qur'an is its own best commentary. It explains itself)"
