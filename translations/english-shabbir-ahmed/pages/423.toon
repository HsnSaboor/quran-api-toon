quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,"It is not fitting for a believing man or a believing woman, when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger, to claim freedom of choice concerning themselves. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed, gone astray in error manifest"
  33,37,"Behold, (O Prophet) you did tell the one to whom Allah had shown Favor and to whom you had shown favor, \"Hold on to your wife and be mindful of Allah. You seek to conceal in your heart what Allah intends to reveal. You are afraid of people whereas it is more appropriate to fear Allah.\" But when Zayd had observed all the rules and divorced her, We gave her to you in marriage. So that henceforth there may be no blame on the believers in respect of spouses of their adopted children when they have come to the dissolution of their union. And the Commandment of Allah must be fulfilled. (Contrary to many erroneous translations, the entire quote in this verse is addressed to Zayd since Messengers fear none but Allah (33:39). Also the admonition of the Prophet to Zayd clearly indicates that he, and not his wife, was at fault"
  33,38,There can be no difficulty to the Prophet in what Allah has assigned unto him as a duty. That was Allah's Law for those who passed on before (the previous prophets). And the Command of Allah is a well-determined Decree
  33,39,"Those who convey Allah's Revelations and fear Him alone, shall never fear anyone but Allah. And Allah is Sufficient to take account"
  33,40,"Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is Allah's Messenger and the Closing Seal of all Prophets. And Allah, indeed, is Knower of all things"
  33,41,O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Remember Allah with much remembrance. (Keep Allah's Message before you a great deal. Now it will be up to you to carry His Message to mankind (3)
  33,42,And strive to establish His Glory on earth morning and night
  33,43,"He it is Who bestows His blessings upon you, and supports you, and His angels, that He may bring you forth from darkness into the Light. And Merciful is He, indeed, to those who attain belief. (2:155-157), (9:103) (14:1), (1)"
