quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,102,"Such is Allah, your Sustainer. There is no god but He. No one is worthy of worship and obedience but He, the Creator of all things. Hence, obey Him! He is the Guardian of all and takes care of every thing"
  6,103,"No vision can encompass Him while He encompasses all vision. He is Subtile, Unfathomable, and therefore beyond physical perception. He is Aware of the minutest details"
  6,104,"(You are not expected to know His Person.) Say (O Prophet), \"The manifest Enlightenment has come to you from your Lord. Whoever sees the Truth, does so for his own good. And whoever turns blind, hurts himself. I am not your keeper or guardian"
  6,105,"And thus We give many facets to Our verses that they might realize that, \"You (O Prophet) have indeed taken these teachings deep down in your heart.\" (Allah has taught the Messenger in the most beautiful manner). And through this method of TASREEF We make the Message clear to those who use their perceptual knowledge"
  6,106,"Follow that which is revealed to you from your Lord. There is no god but He. And disregard those who associate others with Him (21:20-2)"
  6,107,"We could have created all people without free will and they would then not associate any partners with Him. (But guidance has been distinguished from straying (2:256)). And We have not appointed you (O Messenger) as their guardian, nor are you responsible for them"
  6,108,O Believers! Insult not the idols they set up besides Allah. They might insult Allah in their ignorance and hurt themselves. To every community Our Law has made their deeds seem fair. Then unto their Lord is their return and He will inform them what they accomplished and He will make them understand what they really used to do in life
  6,109,"They swear by Allah that if a miracle comes to them, they would surely believe in it (the Book). Say, \"All miracles are with Allah (if you reflect on the Universe). What can make you understand that even if a physical miracle came to them, they will find other excuses and still not believe"
  6,110,"Our Law keeps their hearts and their eyes turned away from the Truth. Since they have preemptively rejected it (the Qur'an), We let them wander blindly in their rebellious attitude"
