  53,31,"And unto Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. (He has designed the Universe such that no action goes without a consequence). That He may requite those who destabilized lives, with their own deeds, and reward with goodness those who benefited humanity. ("
  53,32,"Those who abstain from the greater transgressions that deplete the communal energy, and from shameful deeds and stinginess, even though they may sometimes waver, behold, your Lord is Immense in absolving their imperfections. He knows you best since He brings you into being from the earth, and when you were still hidden in the bellies of your mothers? Therefore, claim not piety for yourselves. He knows best as to who walks aright"
