quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  7,96,"If the people of the towns had believed in the Divine Laws and run their system aright, We would have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth. But they denied and what they earned with their deeds seized them"
  7,97,"Can the people of any community ever feel secure that Our Requital will not come upon them at night, while they are asleep"
  7,98,Or do the people of townships feel secure from the coming of Our Requital upon them in the daytime while they play
  7,99,Do they feel secure from the subtle progression of the Divine Laws? Do they think that the Divine Law grants them unconditional security? Only the losers feel secure from the subtle progression of Allah's Law of Requital
  7,100,Is it not a lesson for those who inherit the earth from previous generations that they could suffer similar consequences? Trailing behind in the community of nations is a tribulation in itself. And Our Law can cause their intellectual and perceptual faculties to be sealed and blunted for their failings
  7,101,"Such were the communities whose historical accounts We relate to you (O Prophet). Their Messengers came to them with clear evidence of Truth. But they preemptively rejected it, and then stuck to rejection. Or they denied the Truth in blind following since their ancestors had denied it. This is how the rejecters cause Allah's Law to seal their hearts to reason"
  7,102,"And in most of them We found no bond with their honored stature of humanity (17:70). And We found that most of them slip away from the Permanent Values"
  7,103,"(Here is another historical account. Moses was the next generation to Shoaib. After the Midyans had risen and declined in the previous millennium), We sent Moses to Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our Revelations and they willfully rejected them. Now see the consequence of the corrupters"
  7,104,"Moses said, \"O Pharaoh! I am a Messenger from the Lord of the Worlds"
