quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  31,29,"Do you not see that it is Allah Who makes the night grow longer by shortening the day, and makes the day longer by shortening the night? And that He has subjected the sun and the moon to His Laws, each running along its course for an appointed term? (13:2). Isn't He Aware of all you do"
  31,30,"Thus it is - since Allah, He is the True, and what they call upon instead of Him is the False. He is the Exalted, the Great"
  31,31,"Have you not seen how the ships speed through the sea carrying Allah's blessed provisions - so that He might show you some of His Signs? Herein, behold, are Messages for every person who would patiently observe the Nature and be grateful for learning"
  31,32,"And so, when violent waves surround them like shadows of gloom, they call unto Allah, sincere in their faith in Him (and work according to Divine Laws). But as soon as We save them ashore, some of them compromise (with falsehood). Yet none could knowingly reject Our Messages unless he is a betrayer to his own \"Self\", ungrateful for such blessing"
  31,33,"O Mankind! Be mindful of your Lord, and stand in awe of the Day when no parent will be of avail to his child, nor a child will in the least avail his parent. Verily, Allah's Promise is True. Let not (the instant gratifications of) the life of this world deceive you. And let not yourselves be distracted from Allah by anyone who deceives you (contrary to what Allah has told you about Himself in this Revelation)"
  31,34,"Verily, with Allah alone rests the knowledge of the Hour; He it is Who sends down rain; and He Alone knows what is in the wombs. No one knows what he will reap tomorrow, and no one knows in what land he will die. Verily, Allah alone is Knower, Aware. (Hour = The Great Revolution + Resurrection ; Rain = Resurgence of humanity ; What is in the wombs = Of what character the offspring will turn out to be ; Reap tomorrow = What will happen to him tomorrow ; Land = Circumstance)"
