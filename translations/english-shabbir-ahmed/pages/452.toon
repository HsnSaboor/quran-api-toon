quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is amiss with you? How do you judge
  37,155,Will you not then reflect
  37,156,Or have you a clear authoritative evidence
  37,157,Then bring your Divine Authority if you are truthful
  37,158,And they imagine relationship between the unseen forces and their Lord. But the unseen forces know their assignments and constantly remain in His servitude
  37,159,Glorified is Allah from what they attribute to Him
  37,160,But the sincere servants of Allah
  37,161,"Verily, neither you nor what you worship"
  37,162,Can tempt the sincere servants against Him
  37,163,Only the one who rushes to the Blazing Fire
  37,164,"The sincere servants say, \"Each one of us has an assignment"
  37,165,"And, behold, we are soldiers in ranks"
  37,166,"And, verily, we, yes we are they who strive to establish His Glory on earth. ('Sabh' = Swim with long and strong laps and strides. It is not the rolling of the rosary-beads or to hymn some words)"
  37,167,And indeed the disbelievers used to say
  37,168,"If only we had a reminder from the old generations, or a Scripture as they had"
  37,169,We would certainly be sincere servants of Allah alone
  37,170,"And yet, now they are denying the Truth. In time, they will come to know what they denied"
  37,171,"Our Word has already gone forth to Our servants, the Messengers"
  37,172,"That verily, they - indeed they - would be helped"
  37,173,And that Our soldiers - they indeed - would be the victors
  37,174,So (O Prophet) withdraw from the disbelievers for a while
  37,175,"And see them for what they do, and soon they will see what they now don't"
  37,176,Do they really wish to hasten Our retribution
  37,177,"But when it comes upon their front-yards, it will be a dreadful awakening for those who have been sufficiently warned"
  37,178,"Hence, turn aside from them for a while"
  37,179,"And see them for what they do, and soon they will see what they now don't"
  37,180,"Glory to your Lord, the Lord of Majesty, Exalted above their contriving"
  37,181,And Peace and salutation to all the Message-bearers
  37,182,"And all Praise is due to Allah, the Sustainer of the Worlds! (And to that end strive the Soldiers in Ranks)"
