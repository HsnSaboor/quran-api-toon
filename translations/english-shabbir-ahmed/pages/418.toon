quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  33,1,"O Prophet! Be mindful of Allah and heed not the deniers of the Truth and the hypocrites. Verily, Allah is Knower, Wise"
  33,2,And follow that which is revealed to you from your Lord. Allah is Aware of all you people do
  33,3,"And put your trust in Allah, for, Allah is Sufficient as Guardian"
  33,4,"Allah did not give any man two hearts in his chest. (You cannot be a believer and a disbeliever at the same time). And He never regards your wives as your mothers because of your senseless utterances, such as your declaring them as your mothers. (2:226), (58:2-4). Nor does He regard your adopted sons as your biological sons. These are mere words that you utter with your mouths, but Allah declares the Truth and shows the Way"
  33,5,"Name your adopted children after their fathers; that is more just in the Sight of Allah. And if you do not know who their fathers were, then they are your brothers, sisters and friends in Faith. (You shall treat them as family members). There is no blame on you for an unintentional mistake. What counts is the intention of your hearts, for Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"
  33,6,"The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves and their own people. (Seeing that he is as a father to them), his wives are their mothers. In accordance with Allah's decree the relatives have a higher claim (in matters of inheritance) than other believers and the immigrants. Nevertheless, you are to deal with your friends in kindness. All this is recorded in this well-written and well-scored Book. (2:180,) (4:11), (9:111), (3)"
