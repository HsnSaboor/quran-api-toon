quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  20,114,"Know, then, that Sublimely Exalted is Allah, the Ultimate Sovereign, the Ultimate Truth. (O Prophet) Hasten not in the learning and implementation of the Message of the Qur'an before a particular revelation to you is completed. These Messages given to you shall be established in stages, but always say, \"My Lord! Increase me in knowledge"
  20,115,"(Without Divine guidance of Revelation man is easily fallible.) And indeed, long ago We made a covenant with Adam (the mankind) that he would hold fast to Our Commands, but he forgot, and We found no constancy in him. (Adam = Mankind (2:30-3)"
  20,116,"Recall when We said to the angels, \"Bow before Adam, they bowed except Iblis; he refused.\" (Divine Laws in the Universe have been made of service to man but his selfish desire rebels against himself)"
  20,117,"And thereupon We said, \"O Adam! Verily, this is an enemy to you and your wife so let him not drive the two of you out of this Garden so that you are landed into difficulty. You shall then have to toil hard for getting your sustenance"
  20,118,"Behold, you are living the life of Paradise (on this very earth) where you are guaranteed never to go hungry and never to walk improperly clothed"
  20,119,"Neither do you go thirsty, nor are you exposed to the burning sun.\" (Well provided with food, clothing, shelter, the basic needs)"
  20,120,"But Satan whispered to him (The selfish desire was teaching him a sinister lesson), \"O Adam! Shall I lead you to the tree of eternal life and ownership that is ever-lasting"
  20,121,Man and woman both ate the fruit of the Tree. People started dividing among themselves and their basic necessities of life ceased to remain guaranteed. They had to toil and contend with one another to earn their livelihood. This exposed the flaws in their character. They tried to hide their selfish behavior with superficial courtesy. Adam and his mate had disobeyed their Lord and gone astray
  20,122,Thereafter his Lord elected him and accepted his repentance and guided him
  20,123,"He said, \"Go down hence, O humans, males and females, foes to one another competing for sustenance! Nonetheless, there shall most certainly come to you guidance from Me. And whoever follows My Guidance will not go astray, nor will face hardship.\" (Nations who adopt Divine Principles, their economy will be abundant)"
  20,124,"But whoever will turn away from My remembrance, thus ignoring My Commands, his will be a narrow life. (Such individuals and nations will live in economic and moral poverty). And I shall bring such of them blind to the Assembly on the Day of Resurrection. (17)"
  20,125,"He will wonder, \"My Lord, why did you gather me blind when I used to see"
