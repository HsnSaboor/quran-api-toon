quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,270,"Whatever you spend on others or whatever pledge you make, Allah knows it. Those who do wrong by withholding charity shall have none to help them"
  2,271,"If you disclose your charities, it is well, but if you give in secret to the needy, it will be better for you. This kind of giving has the power of erasing the imprints of your ill deeds on your \"Self\". This Law has been decreed by Allah Who knows the interrelations of all your actions within and without your personality"
  2,272,"Your responsibility (O Messenger!) is only to show them the Right Way (and not to make them walk it). He has established Rules for attaining Guidance.(4:88). (O People!) Whatever good you give benefits your own \"Self\" when you spend for the sake of Allah. Any charity you give will be repaid to you, without the least injustice"
  2,273,"And give to the needy who are suffering in the Cause of Allah and cannot emigrate and those who are unable to go about the earth in search of livelihood. One, who is unaware of their condition, might think they are free from want, because they abstain from begging. But you can recognize them by the marks on their faces because they do not ask people insistently. Whatever good thing you spend on them, Allah is Aware of it"
  2,274,"Those who spend their wealth on the needy, by night and by day, secretly or publicly, have their reward with their Sustainer. They shall have nothing to fear or regret"
