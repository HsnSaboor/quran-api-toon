quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,51,O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! (Since they deny the Final Revelation that is the Constitution of your state). Do not take the Jews and Christians as your allies. They are allies one to another. He among you who takes them for allies is one of them. Allah does not guide those who displace Command with desire
  5,52,"You will see those who harbor doubt in their hearts running to them saying, \"We fear that a change of fortune may befall us.\" But, Allah will bring you victory, or His Command will come to pass and they will regret what they harbored in their hearts"
  5,53,"The believers will then wonder: \"Are these the same people who swore by Allah that they were with the believers?\" Eventually, all their deeds will go to waste and they will be great losers"
  5,54,"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! If you revert from your DEEN Allah will bring in your place people whom He loves and who love Him. They will be kind to the believers, and stern with the rejecters. They will strive in the Cause of Allah without fear of any blame. Such is the Bounty of Allah that He gives according to His Laws. He is Infinite, All Knowing"
  5,55,"Your real friends and protectors are Allah, His Messenger and those believers who establish the Divine System, set up the equitable Economic Order and humble themselves before Allah's Commands"
  5,56,"Those who ally themselves with Allah and His Messenger and the believers, belong in the party of Allah. Absolutely they are the victorious"
  5,57,"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Do not take for allies, some of the people who were given the Scripture before you, and the rejecters who mock and ridicule your Religion. Be mindful of Allah's Commands if you are indeed believers"
