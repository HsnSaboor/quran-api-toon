quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,1,"All Praise in word and action belongs to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and appointed darkness and light. (All things in the Universe witness and manifest His Glory). Yet those who reject the Truth, hold others as equal with their Sustainer"
  6,2,"He is the One Who created you from inorganic matter, and decreed a term for you humans, a term known to Him. It is determined according to His Laws, for individuals (3:144), (56:60) and nations (7:34), (10:49), (13:38). Yet you keep doubting and arguing about Him"
  6,3,He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth. He knows all that you keep secret as well as all that you do openly
  6,4,"Yet whenever a Message from the Revelations of their Sustainer came to them, they turned away from it"
  6,5,"And so they are denying this Truth as it has come to them. However, soon they will come to understand what they used to ridicule"
  6,6,"Do they not see how many a generation Our Law of Requital has annihilated before them? We had established them on earth more firmly than you, and We gave them plenty of blessings of the heavens and the earth, abundant showers from the sky and rivers flowing beneath them. When they trailed behind in humanity, Our Law obliterated them or caused them to be enslaved by another nation"
  6,7,"Even if We had sent down to you (O Prophet) a pre-printed book written upon parchment, so that they could feel it with their hands, the rejecters would have said, \"This is nothing but obvious magic"
  6,8,"They say, \"Why is not an angel sent down to him,\" for them to behold? If We sent down an angel, the matter would have been judged; no further time would be allowed them. (We send angels to behold only when the period of respite is over (16)"
