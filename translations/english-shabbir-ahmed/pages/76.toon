quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,195,"And their Lord has heard them, \"I never let the effort of any worker, male or female, go vain. Men and women are from one another, so their Recompense shall be equal. Those who emigrated, or were driven out of their homes, and suffered harm in My Cause, and fought and were slain, I shall blot their inequities. The imprints of their misdeeds on their \"Self\" will be erased. I shall admit them into Gardens with rivulets flowing beneath.\" A Reward from Allah. And with Allah is the best Reward"
  3,196,(O Prophet) Let it not deceive you that the rejecters of the Truth seem to be able to do on earth as they please
  3,197,It is but a brief enjoyment. Hell is their resting place; what a miserable bed to lie on! (They invested not in the Hereafter)
  3,198,"Those who walked aright as enjoined by their Lord, for them are scenic Gardens, with rivulets flowing beneath, a Gift of Welcome from their Lord. And the reward from Allah is the best for such people who have grown in humanity and eased the way for others"
  3,199,"Among the People of the Book are some who believe in Allah, and in that which is revealed to you, and in what was revealed to them. They humble themselves before Allah. They trade away not Allah's Revelations for a little gain. Verily, their Reward is with their Lord and Allah is Swift in account"
  3,200,"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Be patient in adversity, outdo others in endurance, and remain united strengthening the bond of mutual brotherhood. Be mindful of your duty to Allah and be assured that your efforts will bear fruit"
