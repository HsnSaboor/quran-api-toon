quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,"But nay, you prefer the life of this world. (Given to instant gains instead of living upright that ensures success in both lives (2:201), (3:147), (4:134), (7:156), (10:64), (17:72), (28)"
  87,17,Although the Hereafter is better and more enduring
  87,18,"Behold, this has been said in the former Revelations as well. ('Suhuf' = Scrolls = Revelations)"
  87,19,The Revelations of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Has the news of the Dominating Event reached you
  88,2,Some faces on that Day will be downcast
  88,3,"Laboring, exhausted. (They were in motion without action. They toiled without clear direction)"
  88,4,As they enter a sizzling Fire
  88,5,Given to drink from a spring of burning anguish
  88,6,No food for them but the bitterness of dry thorns (that they scattered to hurt others during their wayward journey through life)
  88,7,"Which nourishes not, nor relieves hunger"
  88,8,On that Day some faces will shine with Bliss
  88,9,Happy with the fruit of their effort
  88,10,In a Garden exalted in honor
  88,11,Wherein you hear not senseless speech
  88,12,Therein is an ever-flowing Spring of Grace
  88,13,Therein are thrones of honor
  88,14,And shiny glasses set at hand
  88,15,And cushions set in rows
  88,16,And silken carpets spread out
  88,17,"Will they not, then, look at: the water-laden clouds, how they are made"
  88,18,"And at the sky, how it is raised high? (Without visible pillars)"
  88,19,"And at the mountains, how they are entrenched"
  88,20,"And at the earth, how it is spread out? (That you do not even feel the sphere, nor feel its speedy rotations (31:10), (39:5)"
  88,21,"(This is some evidence, O Messenger!) Remind them, for you are one to remind"
  88,22,You are not a task master over them
  88,23,But whoever turns away and denies the Truth
  88,24,Allah will requite him with a great requital
  88,25,"Behold, unto Us is their return"
  88,26,Then it is for Us to call them to account
