quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,35,"Now the idolaters say, \"If Allah had so willed, we would not have worshiped or served anyone but Him, we and our forefathers. Nor had we forbidden things outside His Command.\" Thus did those before them. But, are the Messengers responsible for other than conveying the Message clearly"
  16,36,"And verily, We have raised in every nation a Messenger, saying, \"Serve Allah alone and shun false gods in any form.\" Then Allah guided some of the people (since they adopted the right approach (4:88)). And error took hold of others (who fell into arrogance or blind following (18:29)). Do take lessons from history as you travel in the earth, and see the consequence of the deniers"
  16,37,"(O Messenger) In your compassion you desire everyone to have the right guidance, but Allah never intervenes to guide those who choose straying. And, such have no helpers"
  16,38,"They most strongly swear by Allah that He will not raise the dead. Nay, but it is a promise binding upon Him in truth, but most people do not make use of whatever they know"
  16,39,"He will then make them understand wherein they differ, and the rejecters will realize that they were liars"
  16,40,"Whenever We Will anything to be, We say unto it Our Word \"Be\" and it is. (The moment We pass a Decree in the World of Command, it goes into action)"
  16,41,"Those who emigrate in the Cause of Allah because they were oppressed, We shall give them good lodging in the world, and surely the reward of the Hereafter is greater, if they knew"
  16,42,"They have been steadfast, and have put their trust in their Sustainer"
