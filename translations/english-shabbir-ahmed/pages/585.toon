quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,Someone frowned and turned away
  80,2,Because the blind man approached him
  80,3,How could you know that he might have grown in goodness
  80,4,Or that he be enlightened and the Reminder might benefit him
  80,5,As for him who deems himself in no need of Guidance
  80,6,Unto him you give attention
  80,7,Yet it is not your responsibility if he grows not in goodness
  80,8,But as for him who came to you in all eagerness
  80,9,And feared straying
  80,10,Him did you disregard
  80,11,"Nay, indeed this is an Advisory"
  80,12,So let him pay heed who will
  80,13,In Scrolls Dignified
  80,14,"Exalted, Purified"
  80,15,By the hands of Scribes
  80,16,Honorable and virtuous
  80,17,"Man destroys himself, how ungrateful, rejecting the Sublime Truth"
  80,18,Out of what thing has He created him
  80,19,"From the male and the female gametes He created him, and then fashioned him in due proportion"
  80,20,And then makes the Way easy for him. (Endowed with faculties)
  80,21,Then causes him to die and brings him to disintegrated states. ('Qabr' = Grave = Disintegrated state = The state of sleep between physical death and Resurrection)
  80,22,"Then, when He will, He shall raise him to life again"
  80,23,"Nay, man did not fulfill what He enjoined upon him"
  80,24,Let man consider his food. (His own food has involved so many hands from the field to the mouth. Shouldn't he share Our provision with others)
  80,25,How We pour water in showers
  80,26,"And then We split the earth, split and cleave"
  80,27,And cause the grain to grow therein
  80,28,"And vineyards, and fresh vegetation"
  80,29,And olive trees and palm trees
  80,30,And dense beautiful gardens
  80,31,And fruits and grasses
  80,32,Provision for you and your cattle
  80,33,But when comes the Call
  80,34,On the Day when a man will flee from his brother
  80,35,And his mother and his father
  80,36,And his wife and his children
  80,37,To everyone on that Day will be enough his own concern
  80,38,Some faces on that Day will be bright as dawn
  80,39,"Laughing, rejoicing at good news"
  80,40,And some faces on that Day will have dust upon them
  80,41,With gloom overspread
  80,42,"These, these will be the ones who denied the Truth and divided humanity"
