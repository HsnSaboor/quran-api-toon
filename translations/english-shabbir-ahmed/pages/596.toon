quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,Which only the most unfortunate must endure
  92,16,He who denies and turns away
  92,17,But far removed from it is he who walks aright
  92,18,Who gives his wealth that he may grow in goodness
  92,19,Not that he is returning any favors
  92,20,"But only to seek the Approval of his Lord, the Most High"
  92,21,And soon he will be pleased
  93,1,(O Sincere human being!) Consider the Daylight
  93,2,"And the night when it is still. (There is light at the end of the tunnel and with hardship is ease, like there is Daybreak after the Night (89:1), (92)"
  93,3,"Your Lord has never forsaken you, nor did He ever forget you"
  93,4,"And verily, being far-sighted is better for you than being short-sighted"
  93,5,"And verily, soon will your Lord give unto you so that you will be well-pleased"
  93,6,"Did He not find you in a lonely state, and give you an environment"
  93,7,"And He found you looking for guidance, and showed you the way. ('Dhall' = Wandering = Looking for guidance = Straying)"
  93,8,"And He found you dependent, and made you independent. (Infancy to youth)"
  93,9,"Now you shall not treat harshly any orphan, widow, the helpless and he who feels left alone in the society"
  93,10,And never shall you repulse him who seeks help
  93,11,But the blessings of your Lord you shall speak of by sharing. ('Haddith' = Convey and share what you have learned and gained)
  94,1,"Did We not expand your chest? (Endowed you with resilience, understanding and a heart and mind to accomplish the impossible)"
  94,2,And thus lightened your burden. (Made the journey through life easy by bestowing upon you the perceptual and intellectual faculties)
  94,3,Which would weigh on your back so heavily
  94,4,"And exalted your renown (O Prophet!). (And gave eminence to you, O Mankind)"
  94,5,"And behold, with every hardship comes ease"
  94,6,"Indeed, with every hardship comes ease"
  94,7,"Hence, whenever you are free from the immediate task, embark upon the next strife"
  94,8,And turn all your attention to your Lord. (Remain focused on the Mission entrusted upon you by your Lord)
