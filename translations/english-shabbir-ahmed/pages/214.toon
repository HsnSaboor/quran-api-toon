quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  10,43,And among them you will find those who look at you without seeing. (Their mind is roaming elsewhere). Can you show the way to those who are blind of the heart
  10,44,Allah is never unjust to human beings; but people wrong themselves. (Failing to use the God-given faculties is the first wrong one can commit. It brings the humans down to subhuman levels)
  10,45,"On the Day when He will gather them, they will think as if they lived in this world for one hour of the day. Others will think it was a day or a few days (20:103-104). They will recognize one another as they did yesterday. Lost are those who used to deny that they were destined to meet Allah, face His Law of Requital, and thus remained unguided"
  10,46,"Whether We let you (O Messenger), behold something of what We promise them, or cause you to die, unto Us is their return (and the Law of Requital is ever vigilant). Allah is the Watcher over what they do"
  10,47,For every nation there has been a Messenger. And he always explained to them the distinction between justice and injustice. The Law of Requital has never unjustly dealt with any nation
  10,48,"They say, \"When will the promise be fulfilled, if you believers are truthful"
  10,49,"Say (O Messenger), \"I have no power even to avert any harm to myself, or benefit myself contrary to the Laws of Allah. Every nation determines its own rise and fall. When the time comes, they can neither delay, nor hasten the Requital"
  10,50,"Say, \"Have you thought, when His retribution comes to you suddenly by night, or in the bustling day, what portion of it would the guilty wish to hasten"
  10,51,"Would you then profess belief in it at last, when it comes to pass! Ah! Now? And you wanted to hasten it on.\" (But the period of Respite has been over)"
  10,52,"It will be said to the oppressors and violators of human rights, \"Taste the eternal torment, the exact reward of what you earned"
  10,53,"They keep asking you (O Prophet), \"Is it really true?\" Say, \"Yes indeed, by my Lord, it is really true. And you cannot defy His Laws"
