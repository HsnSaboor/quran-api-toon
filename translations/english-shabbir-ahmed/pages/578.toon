quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,"Nay, but you love instant results"
  75,21,And give little thought to the long term. ('Akhirah' = Hereafter = Life to come = Future = Long term = What follows = Subsequent = Enduring. Tomorrow is today's 'Akhira)
  75,22,Some faces that Day will beam with happiness
  75,23,Looking up to their Lord
  75,24,And some faces on that Day will be despondent
  75,25,Expecting a back breaking calamity
  75,26,"Nay, when the last breaths come up to the throat"
  75,27,"And those around cry, \"Is there any charmer"
  75,28,But he knows that this is the parting
  75,29,And it is pang upon pang
  75,30,That day the drive is to your Lord
  75,31,"For he neither stood by the Truth, nor did he follow it. ('Sal'= To follow, like the runners-up horse closely follows the winner = To closely follow the Commands of Allah)"
  75,32,"Rather, he used to deny and turn away"
  75,33,And then used to walk back to his folk and his ways gleefully
  75,34,This is the most befitting for you - now this is the most befitting
  75,35,Again! This is the most befitting for you - now this is the most befitting. (The impending requital befits the behavior)
  75,36,Does man think he will be left alone like a soundless broken musical string
  75,37,Was he not gametes that moved to join
  75,38,Then he became a zygote. And He shaped and fashioned him in due proportion
  75,39,"And He has made of humans pairs, male and female"
  75,40,"Is not He, then, Able to bring the dead to life"
  76,1,Has there not passed over man an era when he was not even worth mentioning
  76,2,"Behold, it is We who have created the human being from marked out cells, male and female gametes, that joined. Then We passed him through subtle changes. And then We made him a being endowed with Hearing and Sight"
  76,3,"Verily, We it is Who have shown him the Way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful"
  76,4,"Behold, for those who deny the Truth we have readied chains and shackles and a blazing flame. (Chains and shackles of conjecture, blind following and superstition, and the fire of confusion and regret are the logical consequences of relegating the Truth)"
  76,5,"Behold, the truly virtuous will drink from a cup sweetened with nectar of flowers. ('Kafur' = Camphor = Cool temperament = Nectar from the calyx of grape as it flowers = Sweet and fragrant drink of Divine Bliss)"
