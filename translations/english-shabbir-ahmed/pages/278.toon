quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  16,94,"Do not abuse the oaths among you. When you make pledges with people or sign treaties with other nations, be not deceitful. If you did that, you would be hindering people from the Path of Allah. And, you will lose the confidence of people and nations. Your feet will slip after being firmly planted and you will suffer a heavy punishment"
  16,95,"Do not trade your Covenant with Allah for petty gains. Verily, Allah possesses what is far better for you, if you but knew"
  16,96,"What you possess runs out, but that which He has (that you deposit with Him) lasts forever. We will give beautiful rewards (in both lives) to those who are steadfast in their pledges and in doing good deeds"
  16,97,"Whoever, whether male or female, does works that help others and is a believer, We shall certainly cause them to live a good life, and We shall grant them the rewards considering the best of their actions"
  16,98,"(Whenever you try to convey and implement the Message of the Qur'an, you will face stern opposition. This opposition will come from those who worship their selfish desire). Seek refuge with perseverance and confidence in the Laws of Allah"
  16,99,This Satan (your selfish desire) has no power over those who truly believe and put their trust in their Lord
  16,100,Satan's power is only over those who befriend him. Such are Mushrikoon (idol worshipers) since they worship their own desire instead of God
  16,101,"And now that We replace one Message by another, for Allah is fully Aware of what He reveals in stages, some people say, \"You are an inventor.\" (But, human civilization has evolved sufficiently to be given the perfect Divine System. This Qur'an will remain a watcher over previous Scriptures (5:48)). But most of them do not know this fact"
  16,102,"Tell them, \"The Sacred and Soothing Divine Energy has brought it down from your Lord in Absolute Truth (Gabriel (2:97), 'Rooh, Rauh' Soothing Mercy (12:87), Trustworthy (26:193)). This Qur'an will keep firm in thought and action, those who accept it. And it will provide Guidance and the good news to all who submit to Allah"
