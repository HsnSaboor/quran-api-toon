quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  21,36,"(O Prophet) whenever the rejecters see you, they make you a target of their mockery, saying, \"Is this the one who talks of your gods?\" And yet, it is they who deny all mention of (the True God) the Beneficent"
  21,37,"Man is a creature of haste. I will show you more and more of My signs, but ask Me not to hasten"
  21,38,"And they say, \"When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are men of truth"
  21,39,"If those who are bent upon denial, but knew that they will not be able to repel the fire from their faces and from their backs, and they will not be helped"
  21,40,"Nay, but it will come upon them suddenly, that it will stun them. They will be unable to repel it, nor will they be given any more respite"
  21,41,"Indeed, (O Prophet) even before your time Messengers have been mocked, but in the end, the mockers were overwhelmed by the very thing they ridiculed (the Divine retribution)"
  21,42,"Say, \"Who guards you in the night and in the day from the Beneficent?\" (It is His Mercy that He does not take you to task for every transgression (4:31), (16:61), (35:45)). Yet, they stubbornly turn away from remembrance of their Sustainer"
  21,43,Do they have gods who can shield them from Our Laws? Their perceived deities cannot even help themselves nor can they be defended against Our Laws
  21,44,"Nay, We let these people and their ancestors enjoy the good things of life for a long time. Don't they see that Our Law visits the earth and We gradually reduce the land in their control? Can they prevail against Our Laws? (Don't they see that every day on earth brings them closer to the end)"
