quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  11,38,"As he was building the ship, and every time the chiefs of his nation passed by him, they mocked at him. Thereupon he said, \"If you are mocking us, behold, we are mocking (at your ignorance) just as you are mocking us"
  11,39,"And soon you will know upon whom a humiliating punishment befalls, and upon whom a lasting torment will come"
  11,40,"Thus it was until Our Command came to pass. Water gushed forth in torrents over the face of the land. Torrential rain began and the rivers started over flowing. We commanded Noah to take with him livestock, a couple each, and to take his family and followers with him. The rejecters, of course, were not to embark (Noah's son and wife (11:45), (66:10) did not embark). The community of believers with Noah was small"
  11,41,"Noah put his trust in Allah and told his people to embark, \"Come on board, in the name of Allah will be its course and its resting. My Lord is the Provider of shelter, Merciful"
  11,42,"The ship sailed with them amidst huge waves as Noah called his son, who was standing aloof, \"O My dear son! Come ride with us; do not be with the disbelievers"
  11,43,"He said. \"I will cling to a hill-top to protect me from the water.\" Noah said, \"Nothing can protect anyone today from God's Command except for those who have earned His Grace.\" (The only security that day in the valley was for those who had believed in Noah, followed his advice and thus attained God's Mercy). A towering wave came between them and his son was among those who drowned"
  11,44,"And it was said, \"O Earth! Swallow your water and, O Sky! Cease!\" And the command was fulfilled. The water sank into the earth. And the ark came to rest upon the Mount"
  11,45,"Noah called upon his Lord, \"My Lord! My son was of my family and Your Promise is the True Promise and You are the Most Just of judges.\" (So, why was he not saved? Didn't You promise to save my family)"
