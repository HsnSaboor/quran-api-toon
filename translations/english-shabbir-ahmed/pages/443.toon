quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,Another Sign for them is that We carry the Children of Adam on the loaded ship
  36,42,And We have created for them similar things to ride on. (And will create things of which you have no knowledge yet)
  36,43,"We could down them, drown them according to Our Laws, with none to respond to their cry of help - and then they cannot be saved"
  36,44,"But as a Mercy from Us, We let them enjoy life for a while"
  36,45,"And yet, when it is said to them, \"Walk aright learning from every yesterday, so that you may build a future worthy of Grace"
  36,46,No Message of their Lord's Messages reaches them without them turning away from it
  36,47,"And when it is said to them, \"Spend on others of the provision Allah has given to you\", the rejecters say to the believers, \"Shall we feed anyone whom Allah could have fed if He so willed? You people are obviously lost in error.\" (6:149), (1)"
  36,48,"And they (change the subject asking), \"When will this warning be fulfilled, if you are men of truth?\" (That our system of life, if it is wrong, will crumble)"
  36,49,"Well, nothing awaits them but a single Blast of Requital that will overtake them while they keep contending"
  36,50,"And they shall not even have time to utter their last wish, nor will they be able to get together with their families"
  36,51,"And when the Trumpet is blown, behold, out of their disintegrated states unto their Lord they will run. ('Qabr' = grave = disintegrated state)"
  36,52,"They will exclaim, \"Oh, woe unto us! Who has awakened us from our beds of sleep? This is what the Beneficent promised, and the Messengers spoke the truth.\" (The concept of punishment in the grave is non-Qur'anic and, hence, wrong)"
  36,53,"Nothing but a single Blast, no more, and behold, before Us all of them will be presented"
  36,54,"This Day no person will face the least injustice, nor will you be rewarded other than what you had been doing"
