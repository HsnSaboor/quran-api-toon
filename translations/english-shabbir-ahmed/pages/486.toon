quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  42,23,"This is the good news from Allah to His servants who believe and lead a righteous life. Say, \"No reward do I ask you for this other than that you show loving kindness to the ones near (in the human bond, and thus seek the Way to your Lord (25:57)).\" For, anyone who benefits people, We shall grant him additional good. And, verily, Allah is ever Absolver of imperfections, Responsive to gratitude"
  42,24,"Do they say, \"He has invented a lie about Allah?\" But then, had Allah so willed, He could have made your heart insensitive (10:16). And Allah will wipe out the falsehood and will prove the Truth by His Words. Verily, He is the Knower of all that is in the hearts"
  42,25,"And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants, and pardons their ill-deeds and He knows all you do. ('Taubah' = Repentance = Coming to the right course and taking corrective action. Pardon = Blotting out the unfavorable imprints on the human \"Self)"
  42,26,"And accepts all those who attain belief and help others, and He gives them a far exceeding reward from His bounty. But for those who adamantly deny the Truth and choose to stay in darkness, is a severe retribution"
  42,27,"And if Allah made His provision unlimited for His servants, they would have created more disorder in the earth (by increasing in pride and greed (96:6)). But as it is, He bestows His provision in due measure according to His Laws. For, behold, He is Aware, Seer of His servants (their needs and their psyche)"
  42,28,"And He it is Who sends down rain after they have despaired and He spreads out His Grace widely. And He is the Protecting Friend, the Owner of all Praise"
  42,29,"And among His Signs is the creative design of the Heavens and the Earth, and the living creatures which He has dispersed throughout them. And He is Able to gather them together when He will. (Herein is an allusion to the existence of life in other celestial bodies, and to man meeting with the 'aliens' some day)"
  42,30,"Now whatever calamity befalls you, is a consequence of your own actions and He pardons a great deal. (If mankind harmonize themselves with Divine Laws, their Systems would run as orderly as the rest of the Universe does)"
  42,31,"And you cannot evade the Law of Requital anywhere in the earth, and you have no patron and no helper besides Allah"
