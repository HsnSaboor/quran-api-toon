quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  34,1,"All Praise is due to Allah to Whom belong all things in the heavens and all things in the earth. The entire Universe manifests His Praise in its design, action, discipline and splendor. And for Him is the Praise in the Hereafter, and He is the Wise, the Aware"
  34,2,"He knows all that enters the earth, and all that comes out of it, and that which descends from the high atmosphere and that which ascends to it. And He is Merciful, Forgiving. (He nourishes the entire Cosmos and absolves imperfections)"
  34,3,"And yet the disbelievers say, \"Never will the Hour come upon us.\" Say, \"Nay, by my Lord, it is coming to you. By the Knower of the Unseen, it will most certainly come upon you. (The Great Revolution in this world and the Hour of Resurrection are bound to come). Not an atom's weight in the heavens and the earth, escapes His Knowledge, nor is hidden anything smaller or larger, but it is recorded in a Clear Record"
  34,4,"That He may reward those who attain belief and serve others with wealth and person, and thus grow their own personality. For them is the protection of forgiveness and honorable provision of mind and body"
  34,5,"Whereas those who strive against Our Revelations trying to defeat their purpose, theirs will be a suffering of painful anxiety"
  34,6,"Those who make use of the perceptual and conceptual knowledge that they have been given, see that the Revelation to you (O Prophet) from your Lord, is the Truth. And that it leads to the Path of the Almighty, the Owner of Praise"
  34,7,"But those who are bent upon denying, say, \"May we show you a man who says that after you are dispersed in dust completely - lo and behold! - You will be created anew"
