quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,44,"The dwellers of the Garden will call out to the dwellers of the Fire, \"We have found that what our Sustainer promised us has come true. Have you too, found that what your Sustainer promised you has come true?\" They will answer, \"Yes!\" Then from their midst a voice will proclaim, \"Allah rejects the oppressors who wrongfully violated human rights"
  7,45,"They hindered men and women from the Path of Allah and tried to make it crooked, thus practically denying the Law of Requital and the life Hereafter"
  7,46,"Between the people of Paradise and Hell there will be a veil. On the Heights there will be people with insight who will recognize others by their looks. They will greet those who, in their estimate, are worthy of entering the Garden, with \"Peace!\" (2:143), (4:4)"
  7,47,"When they turn to the ones who have been living a hellish life, they will say, \"Our Lord! Keep us away from the ways of the wrongdoers and violators of human rights"
  7,48,"The people on the Heights will recognize another group and say to them, \"How did your multitude, the wealth you amassed and the things you took pride in, help you"
  7,49,"And pointing to the dwellers of the Garden, they will say, \"Are these not the people about whom you used to swear that Allah will never bestow His Grace upon them? They are entering the Garden where there will be no fear or grief.\" (They will make it clear that the Divine Law favors no particular peoples. Obeying His Laws brings His Grace and Bounties\"). Follow His Laws and, \"Enter the paradise of your own making, the society where there shall be no fear nor grief"
  7,50,"The dwellers of Hell will say to the dwellers of Paradise, \"Give us something of the life-giving resources and the provisions bestowed on you by Allah.\" They will reply, \"Allah has made these things forbidden to the rejecters of His Laws.\" (The hellish societies will expect Allah's provisions to be granted to them as free-bees. They will be told that Allah's Bounties can only be achieved by establishing the Right System, and His Law forbids these Bounties to the rejecters)"
  7,51,"Those who took their religion as mere amusement and ritual partying, were deceived by immediate gains of the worldly life (6:70). We will forget them as they forgot the meeting of this Day, and rejected Our Revelations"
