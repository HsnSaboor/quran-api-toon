quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,22,"As he turned his face towards Midyan, he said to himself, \"It may well be that my Lord will guide me onto the right road"
  28,23,"Now when he arrived at the wells of Midyan, he found a crowd of people watering their herds and flocks. And he found two women who were keeping away their flocks. He asked, \"What is the matter with you?\" They said, \"We cannot water our flocks until the shepherds take back their flocks. And our father is a very old man"
  28,24,"So he watered their flocks for them; then he turned back to the shade (of the tree he had been relaxing under). And he said, \"My Lord! I am in dire need of any good that You bestow upon me and any opportunity that You provide me for doing good"
  28,25,"Shortly afterwards, one of the two maidens came to him walking shyly, and said, \"Behold, my father invites you, so that he might duly reward you for having watered our flocks for us.\" As soon as Moses came unto him and told him the story, he said, \"Have no fear! You are now safe from those oppressive folk"
  28,26,"Said one of the two maidens, \"O My father! Hire him! For, the best one you can hire is the competent, the trustworthy"
  28,27,"He (the father) said, \"Behold, I am willing to let you marry one of these two daughters of mine on the understanding that you will remain eight pilgrimages (years) in my service. Then if you make it ten, it will be a grace from you. I do not want to impose any hardship on you. God Willing, you will find me righteous in all my dealings"
  28,28,"He (Moses) said, \"Be that the agreement between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there will be no injustice to me. And Allah be Witness to all that we say.\" (Moses married Shoaib's daughter Zipporah and in time they had two sons)"
