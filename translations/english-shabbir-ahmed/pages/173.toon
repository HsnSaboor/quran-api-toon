quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,171,"They must recall that the Mount Sinai stands over them as a telling Witness. The mountain could shake with a quake and fall to be level with them but the Divine Guidance is the unwavering Truth (13:31), (59:61). We said, \"Hold fast the Scripture We have given you and work the teachings in it, so that you may live upright"
  7,172,"Your Lord brought forth generations from the Children of Adam, and they have been the living testimony that He creates and provides them with sustenance. \"Am I not your Sustainer?\" They practically admit, \"Yes, verily. We testify.\" Thus you cannot say on the Resurrection Day, \"We were not aware of this"
  7,173,"Nor will any excuse avail them such as, \"It was our forefathers who took false gods and we inherited their belief system. Will you punish us for what falsehood others practiced?\" (You will not be questioned what others used to do. No one will bear the load of another (2)"
  7,174,We explain Our Verses in detail so that people turn towards the Book
  7,175,"And tell them what happens to him whom We have conveyed Our Messages and he passes them by. So his selfish desire overtakes him, and he becomes of those who lose their way"
  7,176,"He could have raised himself in honor according to Our Laws, but he clung to the earth and followed his own desire. Therefore his likeness is as the likeness of a dog. Whether you pet him or scold him, he pants. Such is the example of people who deny Our Revelations in practice. (The Revelation of Allah lightens your burdens, while man-made dogmas burden you (7:157)). So relate this narration that they may reflect"
  7,177,"Indeed, pitiable is the example of those who reject Our Verses, since they hurt their own \"Self"
  7,178,Whoever attains Allah's Guidance according to His Laws is led aright. And goes astray he who violates Allah's Law of Guidance
