quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,71,"Say, \"Will you consider this: If Allah were to make the Night last over you till the Resurrection Day, what god is there other than Allah, who can give you light? Will you not, then, listen to the Truth"
  28,72,"Say, \"Will you consider this: If Allah were to make the Day last over you till the Resurrection Day, what god is there other than Allah, who can give you a Night in which you can rest? Will you not, then, see the Truth"
  28,73,"For it is out of His Grace that He has made for you Night and Day - that you might rest therein, and that you may seek of His bounty - and so that you may be grateful"
  28,74,"And (think again) the Day He will call them, He will ask, \"Where are My 'partners' whom you imagined"
  28,75,"And from every community We shall draw a witness (their Prophet) and We shall say to the rejecters, \"Bring your proof for what you used to claim.\" Then shall they know that the Truth is indeed with Allah, and all they used to fabricate will forsake them"
  28,76,"Now, behold, Qaroon (Korah) was one of the people of Moses but he exalted himself and oppressed them (his own Hebrews). We had granted him such riches that his treasure-chests alone would have been a burden for a body of strong men ('miftah = key. 'maftah = chest under lock and key). Behold, his people said to him, \"Exult not, for Allah does not love those who exult (in riches).\" (Korah, a cousin of Moses, was the chief slave driver for Pharaoh, and for his wealth and advisory position he was next in power only to Pharaoh, and equal to Haman. Historically, this legendary \"Trio\" of despotism + priesthood + capitalism, has always joined hands in the exploitation of the masses)"
  28,77,"But seek with the wealth Allah has bestowed upon you, the Home of the Hereafter. And do not forget your portion in this world. Be kind to people, as Allah has been kind to you. Do not create corruption and disorder in the land (such that the poor becomes poorer). Allah does not love the corrupters"
