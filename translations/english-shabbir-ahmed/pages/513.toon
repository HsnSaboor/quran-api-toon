quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  48,16,"Say to these desert Arabs who had stayed behind, \"Soon you will be called against a people mighty in warfare, to fight them until they surrender. And if you obey, Allah will give you a beautiful reward. But if you turn away, as you did turn away before, He will punish you with a painful suffering"
  48,17,"There is no blame for the blind, nor is there blame for the disabled, nor is there blame for the sick. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him in the Gardens underneath which rivers flow. And whoever turns away, him will He punish with an awful doom"
  48,18,"Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance unto you (O Messenger) under that shady tree. For, He knew what was in their hearts, and so He sent down upon them inner peace, and rewarded them by opening the gates to a quick Victory"
  48,19,"And many gains will they achieve in addition, for, Allah is Almighty, Most Wise"
  48,20,"Allah promises you a great many gains that you shall acquire, and has given you these ones just to begin with. And He has restrained the aggressive hands of people from you, that it may be a Sign for the believers (of all times) and so that He may light up for you a Straight Path. ('Huda' and derivatives = Lead, guide, show the way, enlighten, light up the way, walk ahead, be a beacon)"
  48,21,"And there are yet other gains which are beyond your power at this time, but Allah has already encompassed them for you. For, Allah has Power over all things"
  48,22,"Now, if the non-believers fight you, they will certainly turn their backs in flight, and then they will find no protecting friend nor helper"
  48,23,"This is the Law of Allah which has been in force since older times. And never will you find any change in Allah's Law. ('Sunnatillah' = Allah's Law in practice. 'Kalimatillah' = Allah's Word = Allah's Law in theory (3:139), (17:77), (33:38), (33:62), (35:43), (40)"
