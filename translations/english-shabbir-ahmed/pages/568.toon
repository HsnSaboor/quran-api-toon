quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,"And so, he has no friend here today"
  69,36,Nor any food but the discarded shreds he gave to others
  69,37,Which none eat but those who faulted through life
  69,38,"But nay, I call to witness all that you see (that actions have consequences of their like)"
  69,39,And all that you see not (the subtle progression of the Law of Requital)
  69,40,"Behold, this is indeed the revealed Word in the dialect of a noble Messenger"
  69,41,This is not the speech of a poet. Seldom do you reach conviction
  69,42,Nor is it the word of a soothsayer. Little of your intellect do you bring to use
  69,43,It is a Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds
  69,44,And if he had ascribed his sayings unto Us
  69,45,We would have taken him by the right hand
  69,46,And would have cut off his Aorta
  69,47,And none of you could stop Us from doing that
  69,48,"But, verily, it is a Reminder and a giver of eminence to those who wish to walk aright"
  69,49,"And behold, We know well that among you will be deniers"
  69,50,"And behold, this denial will become a source of regret for the rejecters"
  69,51,"For, verily, it is Truth Absolute"
  69,52,"Therefore, work hard to manifest the Glory of your Lord's Tremendous Name"
  70,1,A questioner might ask about the catastrophe that is bound to fall
  70,2,Upon those who deny the Truth. None can repel it
  70,3,"From Allah, Lord of the Stairways of Ascent. (He enables all things to ascend, evolve and become what they are destined to be)"
  70,4,The Universal forces and the Divine Energy ascend unto Him in a Day the measure of which is fifty thousand years
  70,5,"Therefore, you shall do your part with a most handsome steadfastness"
  70,6,"Behold, they see it far away"
  70,7,But We see it near
  70,8,The Day when the sky will melt away
  70,9,And the mountains will become as flakes of wool
  70,10,And a friend will not ask about his friend
