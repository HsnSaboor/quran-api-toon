quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,1,Those vanguards who set up ranks (in order to defend the Divine System)
  37,2,And those officers of the state who help maintain law and order
  37,3,And those believers who convey the Reminder
  37,4,"(Are the living witnesses that) - Verily, most surely, your God is One"
  37,5,He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything that is between them (the intergalactic material) - And the Lord of the sunrises (and of the Light-giving Revelation)
  37,6,"Behold, We have beautified the lowest heaven nearest to the earth with ornaments, the stars and planets"
  37,7,And made them secure against every satanic force (The Revelation brings an end to the false claims of the fortune-telling astrologers)
  37,8,"Repelled faraway from the Truth, the 'occult sciences' despite their boisterous claims, can get not a hint of what Divine Revelation is"
  37,9,Outcast--and theirs is a lasting torment
  37,10,"Even if a thing of their conjecture comes to pass, they are pursued by a Flame of Brightness. (The Divine Revelation exposes the claimants to the 'occult sciences' (18:22), (26:210-212), (52:38), (67:)"
  37,11,"And ask them to enlighten you, \"What is more difficult and stronger - their creation or the rest of Our creation in the multiform Universe? Them (the humans) We have only created out of a sticky clay"
  37,12,"Nay, but whereas you (O Prophet) marvel at the Universe, they mock - and again you marvel at their mocking"
  37,13,They take not to heart the wonders of Nature when reminded
  37,14,And they turn to mockery every Wonder that they see
  37,15,"And of the Revelation they say, \"This is nothing but magical eloquence"
  37,16,"What! When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then be raised again"
  37,17,And even our forefathers
  37,18,"Say, \"Yes, indeed. And you will be brought low"
  37,19,"There will be a single Rebuke, and then, behold, they will begin to see"
  37,20,"And they will say, \"Oh, woe unto us! This is the Day of Judgment"
  37,21,Yes - This is the Day of Decision you used to deny
  37,22,"Bring you up\", it will be said, \"The transgressors and their companions and the leaders whom they obeyed"
  37,23,"Instead of Allah, and lead them onto the path to the Blazing Fire. ('Azwaj' in 37:22 = Companions)"
  37,24,"Halt them! For, they must be questioned"
