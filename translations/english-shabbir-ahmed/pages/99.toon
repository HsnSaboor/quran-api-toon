quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,128,"If a woman experiences ill-treatment from her husband or fears that he might turn away from her, there should be no hesitation in taking corrective action and resolving the matter between them amicably. Conciliation is best. Selfishness is ever present in human psyche. And if you take care to benefit each other and be mindful of Allah, verily Allah is ever Aware of all you do. (Allah, the Cognizant shows you the best way (2:228-234), (4:3), (4:19), (4:35), (4:128), (33:49), (5)"
  4,129,"Men who have been permitted a second wife for post-war exigencies (4:3) must understand that: You will not be able to deal equally between your wives however much you wish. But turn not altogether away from one, leaving her as if in suspense between having and not having a husband. Fulfill the rights of each one of them and be mindful of Allah. Verily, Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. (Your effort is seen 53:40, and He is the Absolver of your imperfections)"
  4,130,"If the couple separate, Allah will provide for each one of them from His Abundance. Allah is Infinite, Wise. (The Divinely Ordained System is versatile enough to accommodate all circumstances)"
  4,131,"And to Allah belong all things in the Highs and all things in the Lows. We directed those who received the Scripture before you, and We direct you to be mindful of Allah's Laws (so that your society operates as smoothly as the Universe is operating). And if you reject the Truth, know that all things in the heavens and all things in the earth belong to Allah. Allah is Self-Sufficient, Owner of Praise"
  4,132,Unto Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And Allah is Sufficient as Guardian (to carry through all affairs of the Universe)
  4,133,"If He wills, He can cause you to disappear O Mankind! And bring forth other beings in your stead. Indeed, Allah is Able to do that"
  4,134,"Whoever desires the reward of the world, let him know that with Allah is the reward of the world and the Hereafter. Allah is ever Hearer, Seer. (Obedience to His Commands ensures success in both worlds)"
