quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"Say, \"I do not even have the power to benefit myself or to avert harm to myself, contrary to the Laws of Allah. Had I the knowledge of what is beyond the reach of human perception, I would have amassed abundant fortune, and no adversity would ever touch me. I am but a Warner and a bearer of good news for those who believe in the Message"
  7,189,"(The Message encompasses life in its totality.) Recall that Allah created life from a single life cell, then made male and female cells, and then shaped you into human beings, males and females. He designed it such that man might incline with love towards the woman. When he gets intimate with her, she carries a light load that she can hardly notice. As she grows heavy with the child, they both implore Allah, their Lord, \"If you indeed grant us a healthy baby, we shall certainly be among the grateful"
  7,190,"But as soon as He grants them a sound baby, they begin to ascribe to other powers beside Him a share in bringing about what He has granted them. Exalted is He, High Above all that they associate with Him"
  7,191,"Do they ascribe to Him as partners things that can create nothing, but are themselves created"
  7,192,"And they cannot help them, nor can they help themselves"
  7,193,"When you invite them to the Guidance, they follow you not. It is the same for you whether you invite them or remain silent"
  7,194,"Those whom you call upon besides Allah, such as mystics and saints, are people like you. Go ahead and call upon them, let them respond by helping you if you are true in your belief"
  7,195,"Do the idols have feet to walk, hands to hold, eyes to see and ears to hear? (Likewise, these human demigods have no foundation of Truth to stand on, nor the power to avert Requital, nor the faculties of confronting Reason). Tell the opponents of the Message, \"Call upon your idols and your so-called partners of Allah, contrive what you can, and give me no respite"
