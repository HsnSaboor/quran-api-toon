quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,44,"Allah causes the revolution of the night and the day. Herein indeed is a lesson for men and women of vision and understanding. (Of straying and guidance, of death and life, of calculating time, of rest and work etc)"
  24,45,"And Allah has created every living creature from water. (Life began in water 21:30). Some of them crawl on their bellies, some walk on two legs, and some walk on four. Allah creates things with a Purpose and according to His Laws. He has Supreme control over all things and events and verily, Allah is the Appointer of due measure of all things"
  24,46,"Verily, We have sent down Messages clearly showing the Truth, but Allah guides onto a Straight Path him who wishes to be guided"
  24,47,"For, some people say, \"We believe in Allah and the Messenger and we obey.\" Then after that a faction of them turns away. Such are not believers"
  24,48,"And so it is that whenever they are called to Allah and His Messenger to judge between them, some of them turn away"
  24,49,"However, if the truth is on their side, they come to him in full submission"
  24,50,Is there disease in their hearts? Or do they bear any doubts? Or do they fear that Allah and His Messenger might deal unjustly with them? They (who wish to obviate justice) are themselves unjust
  24,51,"Whenever invited to Allah and His Messenger to judge in their affairs, the true believers say, \"We hear and we obey.\" They are the ones who will ultimately prosper"
  24,52,"Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, and fears violating Allah's Commands, and walks aright, such indeed are the triumphant"
  24,53,"Whereas there are some who swear by Allah solemnly that, if you order them, they will go forth to any mission. Say, \"Swear not! Obedience is virtuous. Verily, Allah is Aware of all you do"
