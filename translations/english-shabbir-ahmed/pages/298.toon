quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  18,35,"And having thus wronged himself, he entered his garden saying, \"I don't think that this will ever perish"
  18,36,"He said, \"I don't think that the Hour will ever come. And, if indeed I am returned to my Lord, I will surely find something even better as my resort"
  18,37,"His friend differed with him, \"Do you disbelieve in the One Who created you from dust, and then from gametes, and then shaped you into the current human form"
  18,38,"As for me, God is my Lord and I will never accept any other god besides my Lord"
  18,39,"And he continued, \"Alas, when you entered your garden, you should have said, 'This is what Allah has given me according to His Laws for no one has Power but Allah.' You see that I have less wealth and fewer children than you.\" (Still I associate no one with Him)"
  18,40,"He said, \"So my Lord may grant me something better than your garden. (The luxuries of this life are vulnerable). He may send a calamity from the height to wipe out this garden, leaving it a heap of barren dust"
  18,41,"Or, it may happen that the water level recedes low, out of your reach.\" (Therefore we must invest for the Eternity as well)"
  18,42,"And thus it happened. One day, the arrogant man's fruitful gardens were indeed wiped out. And there he was, twisting and turning his hands in sorrow. He lost his property which was now tumbled to pieces in complete ruin. And he could only say, \"Oh, I wish I never worshiped anyone (even my property) instead of my Lord"
  18,43,"Now he had none to help him against the Divine Laws, nor could he help himself"
  18,44,"Thus it is. The only invincible protection comes from Allah alone. He is the Best to grant recompense, and the Best to determine what must be"
  18,45,"Cite for them the example of the materialistic life of this world. It is like the water We send down from the sky, and which is absorbed by plants of the earth. But in time they turn into dry stubble or hay which the winds blow freely about. Allah is Competent and all events take place according to His Laws over which He has full control. (Total preoccupation with the material aspects of life deprives people from growing in humanity)"
