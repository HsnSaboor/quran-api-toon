quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,155,"They incurred condemnation for breaking their Covenant, rejecting Allah's Revelations, and killing the Prophets wrongfully. And for saying, \"Our hearts are wrapped up; we have made up our minds.\" Nay, Allah's Law sets the seal on their hearts because of their persistent denial. They lost their faculties of reasoning. So they do not see the Truth, except a few"
  4,156,And for their disbelief to the extent that they brought a terrible charge against Mary
  4,157,"And for claiming, \"We killed the Messiah Jesus son of Mary, Allah's Messenger.\" They never killed him and never crucified him. But it appeared so to them and the matter remained dubious to them. Those who hold conflicting views on this issue are indeed confused. They have no real knowledge but they are following mere conjecture. Very certainly, they never killed him"
  4,158,"Nay, Allah exalted him unto Himself. (They had plotted thinking that crucifixion was a death of dishonor. But Allah raised him in honor). Allah is Almighty, Wise"
  4,159,"Everyone among the People of the Book must believe before dying, in the truth just stated. Jesus will be a witness against them on the Day of Resurrection (that he was neither crucified nor raised to the heavens. God is not confined to the Heavens)"
  4,160,"Due to the transgressions of the Jews We had forbidden them good things that were before allowed to them, and because of their consistent hindering from the Way of Allah"
  4,161,"Their clergy made usury permissible although it was forbidden, and they devoured the wealth of people with falsification. We have readied for the rejecters grievous suffering"
  4,162,"Among them (the Jews) are those who are well founded in knowledge. And have attained conviction in what has been revealed to you, and in what was revealed before you. They are supporters of the Divine System and of the Just Economic Order, believers in Allah and in the Last Day. We shall soon give them an immense reward. (Islam is for all humanity. Any prior affiliations are irrelevant (2:62), (3)"
