  38,17,"Bear with patience whatever they may say, and remember Our servant David, the man of strength and resources. He always turned unto Us"
  38,18,"Behold, We subdued for him the strong Mountain Tribes that strove along with him night and day"
  38,19,"And the nomad riders of the Ta'er Tribe were all obedient to him. (21:79), (2)"
  38,20,"We strengthened his Kingdom and gave him wisdom and good judgment. And We endowed him with the ability to make just decisions, and speak eloquently. (1)"
  38,21,Have you heard of the story of the two disputing men when they climbed the wall into his private chamber
  38,22,"When they breached his privacy, he was startled. They said, \"Be not startled!\" We both are disputing with each other as to who has done wrong to the other. Therefore, judge fairly between us, deviate not from equity and guide us to the even path"
  38,23,"One of them said, \"Behold, this my brother has ninety nine farms, whereas I have only one. And yet he says, 'Give it over to me', and he dominates me in eloquence.\" ('Na'jah' = Ewe = Female sheep or deer = Agricultural farm)"
  38,24,"David said, \"He has certainly wronged you in demanding your farm in addition to his farms. Thus, behold, many close associates and business-partners treat each other unfairly - except those who believe in the Divine Values and care for the needs of others - but how few are they!\" Afterwards, David wondered that We had tried him. (The feudal and economic system in his kingdom needed reform, as the poor were getting poorer). He implored his Lord to absolve his imperfections, and he immediately bowed himself and turned unto Him for guidance"
  38,25,"So We absolved his imperfections, and, behold - He remained ever close to Our Laws and his efforts reached a happy destination"
  38,26,"(We said to him), \"O David! We have made you a ruler in the earth, therefore, establish the System of justice and equity for people. Never let your judgment be swayed by personal whims causing you to deviate from the Path of Allah. For those who wander from the Path of Allah, is a strict retribution for having forgotten the Day of Account"
