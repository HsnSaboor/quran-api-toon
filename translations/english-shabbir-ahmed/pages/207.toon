  9,123,"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Fight those of the disbelievers who close up on you, and let them find strength among your ranks. And know that Allah is with those who are mindful of His Laws"
  9,124,"Whenever a Surah is revealed some of them (hypocrites) say, \"Which one of you has increased in faith?\" In fact, it has increased the believers in faith and they rejoice"

  9,126,"Don't they see that they are tested once or twice each year (at your hands 9:14)? Still they do not repent, nor pay heed"
  9,127,"When a Surah is revealed, the hypocrites look at each other mockingly as if saying, \"Does anyone see you? Let us leave.\" And then they turn away. Allah's Law turns their hearts away because they are a people who do not use their faculties of understanding"
  9,128,"(All humanity must realize that) there has come to you a Messenger one of your own who feels your burden. He is full of concern for your betterment, and for those who attain belief, he is compassionate, merciful"
  9,129,"(O Messenger) if they turn away, say, \"Allah suffices me. There is no god, but He. In Him I put my trust. He is the Lord of the Tremendous Throne"
