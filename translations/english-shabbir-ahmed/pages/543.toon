quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  58,7,"Do you not realize that Allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. There is no secret meeting of three but He is their fourth, nor of five but He is their sixth, nor of less than that or more but He is with them wherever they may be. And ultimately, on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they truly accomplished. Verily, Allah is Knower of all things"
  58,8,"Have you not noticed those who were forbidden to conspire in secret meetings, and yet they revert to what they were forbidden, and continue to conspire together - for hampering progress, creating wedges of dissension in the society, and disobedience of the Messenger? And when they come to you (O Messenger), they greet you not in the way that Allah greets you - And say to themselves, \"Why does not Allah punish us for what we say?\" Sufficient for them is Hell (in both lives) wherein they burn. And how miserable that destination is"
  58,9,"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! When you consult with one another confidentially, never consult aiming hampering progress of the community, nor in creating wedges of discord therein, and disobedience of the Messenger. But consult together for expansion of individual and social potential and seeking ways to facilitate collective right conduct. And always remain mindful of Allah unto Whom you all shall be gathered. (And all your actions end up facing His Law of Requital in both lives)"
  58,10,"Behold, conspiracy comes forth from selfish desire, in the end causing grief to the believers, but it cannot harm them contrary to Divine Laws. Hence, in Allah should the believers put their trust. (Satan or the selfish desire cannot overwhelm the believers unless they forsake Divine Commands (15:42), (17)"
  58,11,"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! When you are told, \"Accommodate one another in your collective life\", do accommodate, seeing that Allah will open up His resources for you. And when you are told, \"Rise up\", do rise up to the occasion. Allah will exalt to high ranks those of you who truly believe in the Divine Commands, and who use the knowledge that they have been given. For, Allah is Aware of all you do. ('Fas-h' = Open up = Make room = Accommodate others)"
