quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  50,1,"QAF. Qif! Stop and think! Qadir, the Omnipotent, presents this Glorious Qur'an as a witness to itself"
  50,2,"But, nay, they marvel that a Warner from among their own has come unto them! And so these deniers are saying, \"This is a weird thing"
  50,3,What! After we have died and become dust? Such a return is a thought far-fetched indeed
  50,4,"(But) We know what the earth takes of them. (It is only their physical body that becomes dust. Their \"Self\" lives on). And with Us is a Guarded Book (of Laws)"
  50,5,"Nay, but they denied the Truth as soon as it came to them. And so, they are in a state of utter confusion"
  50,6,"Do they not look at the sky above them how We have built it and beautified it, and there are no flaws therein"
  50,7,"And the earth. We have spread it out, and scattered mountains firm on it, and caused it to bring forth plants on it of all beauteous kind. (This gives us a scenario of a huge ball with carpets spread out on it held in place with weights. And the mountains serve as great water reservoirs that help grow the vegetation (13:3), (15:19), (31:10), (39:5), (79:28)"
  50,8,A Vision and an enlightening Reminder for every servant who wishes to turn (to Allah)
  50,9,And We send down from the high atmosphere blessed water whereby We cause to grow colorful gardens and fields of grains
  50,10,And lofty palm-trees with their thickly clustered fruit
  50,11,"A provision for My servants. And by all this We revive a dead land. Thus it is: (your) coming forth"
  50,12,"Before them denied the Message, the nation of Noah, the dwellers of the valley of Ar-Rass (25:38), and Thamud"
  50,13,"And 'Ad, and Pharaoh, and the brothers of Lot"
  50,14,"And the dwellers in the wooded dales (of Midyan), and the nation of King Tubba'. All of them denied their Messengers, so My warning came to pass"
  50,15,"Could, We, then, be worn out by the first creation? Nay, they are still (after such diverse examples,) lost in doubt about a new creation"
