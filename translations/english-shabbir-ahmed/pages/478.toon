quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  41,12,"And He it is Who ordained that they become seven Heavens in two stages and assigned to each heaven its function. And We decorated the sky of the world with shining lamps, and made them secure (that they clash not in their orbits (41:9)). That is the Design of the Almighty, the Knower"
  41,13,"But if they turn away, then tell them, \"I warn you of a thunder (of Requital) like the thunder of Aad and Thamud"
  41,14,"Behold, the Messengers came unto them in their former and latter generations, saying, \"Serve none but Allah!\" They replied, \"If our Lord had willed, He would have sent down angels. This is it, behold, we are disbelievers in what you (claim) are sent with"
  41,15,"Now as for Aad, they behaved proudly in the land doing things contrary to the Truth. And they used to say, \"Who is mightier than us in power?\" How - could they not realize that Allah, Who created them, is Mightier than they in power? But they went on denying Our Messages, knowingly. ('Ja'hd' = Rejecting the Truth knowingly)"
  41,16,"And so We sent upon them a raging windstorm for days of misfortune, that We let them taste a punishment of humiliation in the life of this world. But the punishment of the Hereafter is far more humiliating and they will have none to help them"
  41,17,"And as for Thamud, We showed them the Way, but they preferred blindness over the light of Guidance. So the thunder of a degrading punishment seized them for what they used to earn"
  41,18,And We preserved those who had believed and walked aright. (The believers heeded the forewarning of their Messenger and had followed him to safety)
  41,19,"Hence, the Day! When the enemies of Allah will be gathered to the Fire, led in ranks"
  41,20,"Till, when they reach it, their hearing and their sight and their skins will bear witness against them, about all they had been doing"
