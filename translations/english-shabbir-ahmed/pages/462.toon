quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  39,32,"(Here is the forewarning.) Who does a greater wrong than the one who tells a lie against Allah and the one who denies the Truth when it reaches him? Is not Hell the proper home of those who adamantly deny the Truth and choose to live in darkness? ('Kufr' = Denying the Truth, choosing to live in the darkness of ignorance, journey through life without Divine Guidance, being ungrateful for the Light)"
  39,33,"And, the one who brings the Truth and the one who affirms it - they, indeed they, are the upright. (Note that the statements in this verse and the preceding one allude to the Messenger and the recipients of the Message)"
  39,34,"With their Lord, they have all that they could ever desire. Such is the reward of the doers of good to others"
  39,35,"Allah will blot out the imprints of their faults and give them a reward par excellence, more than befitting for the best of their deeds"
  39,36,"Is not Allah Sufficient for His servant? And yet, they try to intimidate you with others besides Him. He whom violation of Allah's Law of guidance sends astray, for him there is no guide. (He who follows a path that Allah has declared to be wrong, goes astray and he cannot find a guide)"
  39,37,"And he who attains guidance according to Allah's Law of guidance, for him there can be no misleader. Is not Allah All Mighty, the Lord of Requital"
  39,38,"And thus it is - If you ask them, \"Who is it that has created the heavens and the earth?\" - They will answer, \"Allah\". (29:61). Say, \"Have you, then, ever reflected on what you worship besides him? Can they remove harm from me against the Laws of Allah? Can they withhold His Grace if He wills Grace for me?\" Say, \"Allah is Sufficient for me! On Him rely the reliant"
  39,39,"Say, \"O My people! Do all that may be in your power. For, behold, I am a laborer (in the Cause of Allah). In time you will come to know what you now don't"
  39,40,"As to who it is whom covers the torment of humiliation in this world and the Doom ever-Lasting.\" (6:136), (11: 93-121), (20)"
