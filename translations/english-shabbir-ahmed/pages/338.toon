quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  22,47,"And so (O Prophet) they challenge you to hasten the doom, but Allah never fails to fulfill His Promise. A day of your Lord is like a thousand of your years. (32:5), (70:40). (Before your Lord, is the eternal Now. He is Above temporal and spatial bounds)"
  22,48,"(As you sow, so shall you reap\", is a rock-solid Law, as evidenced by the history of the rise and fall of nations.) How many communities have gone before whom I gave respite although they were transgressors, but then My Law of Requital seized them. For with Me is the end of all journeys"
  22,49,"Say, \"O Mankind! I am but a plain Warner to you"

  22,54,"Those who are blessed with true knowledge, will recognize your Lord's Truth, accept it, and then settle it in their hearts and humbly submit to Him. Surely, Allah alone is the Guide of those who truly believe, to the Straight Path. ("
