quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,44,"Or do you think that most of them really hear and use their reason? Nay! they are but like cattle. Nay, they are farther astray. (The cattle at least follow the Divine Laws instinctively)"
  25,45,"Are you not aware of your Lord by His Works? - How He spread the shade. And if He Willed, He could have made it still! Then We have made the sun its pilot. (He could have designed the Solar System differently with the earth remaining stationary)"
  25,46,"And then We gradually withdraw it to Us, a gradual withdrawal"
  25,47,"And, He it is Who makes night a robe for you, and sleep a rest, and makes every day to be a resurrection"
  25,48,"And, He is the One Who sends the winds, glad news of His coming Grace, and We send down pure water from the sky"
  25,49,"That We may give life with it to a dead land, and We provide drink for Our creations, a great many animals and human beings"
  25,50,"And verily, many times We have repeated all this to mankind, so that they might bear in mind. Yet most people refuse to be anything but ungrateful (for such Light-giving Guidance)"
  25,51,"Now had We so Willed, We could have continued to raise up a Warner in every single community. (But, time has now come for the Eternal, Universal Message, the Qur'an)"
  25,52,"Hence, (O Prophet) Disregard the likes and dislikes of the rejecters, but strive hard against them by means of this, with utmost striving. (Jihadan Kabira = The Great Jihad by means of this Qur'an)"
  25,53,"And He it is Who has given freedom of movement to the two kinds of great bodies of water; one is palatable and fresh, the other salt and bitter. Yet, He has made a barrier between them, a partition that is not to be passed. (35:12). (Please see (18:60) for two streams in a different implication"
  25,54,"And He it is Who has created the human being from this very water, (21:30), (24:45) and then He has established relationships by lineage and by marriage, for, your Lord is the Designer of all things. (The best relationships are established on the basis of Ideology (3:102)"
  25,55,"Yet they serve instead of Allah that which can neither benefit them nor harm them. Indeed, the rejecter of the Truth, (regardless of his origin and relationship), joins hands with another rejecter against his own Sustainer. (Zaheer = Helper. Ideology vs. relatives (11:45)"
