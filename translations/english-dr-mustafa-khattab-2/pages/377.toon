quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  27,1,Ṭâ-Sĩn. These are the verses of the Quran; the clear Book
  27,2,˹It is˺ a guide and good news for the believers
  27,3,"˹those˺ who establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and have sure faith in the Hereafter"
  27,4,"As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have certainly made their ˹evil˺ deeds appealing to them, so they wander blindly"
  27,5,"It is they who will suffer a dreadful torment, and in the Hereafter they will ˹truly˺ be the greatest losers"
  27,6,"And indeed, you ˹O Prophet˺ are receiving the Quran from the One ˹Who is˺ All-Wise, All-Knowing"
  27,7,"˹Remember˺ when Moses said to his family, “I have spotted a fire. I will either bring you some directions from there, or a burning torch so you may warm yourselves.”"
  27,8,"But when he came to it, he was called ˹by God˺, “Blessed is the one at the fire, and whoever is around it! Glory be to God, the Lord of all worlds"
  27,9,"O Moses! It is truly I. I am God—the Almighty, All-Wise"
  27,10,"Now, throw down your staff!” But when he saw it slithering like a snake, he ran away without looking back. ˹God reassured him,˺ “O Moses! Do not be afraid! Messengers should have no fear in My presence"
  27,11,"˹Fear is˺ only for those who do wrong. But if they later mend ˹their˺ evil ˹ways˺ with good, then I am certainly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  27,12,"Now put your hand through ˹the opening of˺ your collar, it will come out ˹shining˺ white, unblemished. ˹These are two˺ of nine signs for Pharaoh and his people. They have truly been a rebellious people.”"
  27,13,"But when Our enlightening signs came to them, they said, “This is pure magic.”"
