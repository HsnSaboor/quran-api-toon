quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,55,"There is no blame on the Prophet’s wives ˹if they appear unveiled˺ before their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons, their sisters’ sons, their fellow ˹Muslim˺ women, and those ˹bondspeople˺ in their possession. And be mindful of God ˹O wives of the Prophet!˺ Surely God is a Witness over all things"
  33,56,"Indeed, God showers His blessings upon the Prophet, and His angels pray for him. O believers! Invoke God’s blessings upon him, and salute him with worthy greetings of peace"
  33,57,Surely those who offend God and His Messenger are condemned by God in this world and the Hereafter. And He has prepared for them a humiliating punishment
  33,58,"As for those who abuse believing men and women unjustifiably, they will definitely bear the guilt of slander and blatant sin"
  33,59,"O Prophet! Ask your wives, daughters, and believing women to draw their cloaks over their bodies. In this way it is more likely that they will be recognized ˹as virtuous˺ and not be harassed. And God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  33,60,"If the hypocrites, and those with sickness in their hearts, and rumour-mongers in Medina do not desist, We will certainly incite you ˹O Prophet˺ against them, and then they will not be your neighbours there any longer"
  33,61,"˹They deserve to be˺ condemned. ˹If they were to persist,˺ they would get themselves seized and killed relentlessly wherever they are found"
  33,62,That was God’s way with those ˹hypocrites˺ who have gone before. And you will find no change in God’s way
