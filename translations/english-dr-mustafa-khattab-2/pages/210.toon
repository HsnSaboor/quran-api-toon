quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,15,"When Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who do not expect to meet Us say ˹to the Prophet˺, “Bring us a different Quran or make some changes in it.” Say ˹to them˺, “It is not for me to change it on my own. I only follow what is revealed to me. I fear, if I were to disobey my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day.”"
  10,16,"Say, “Had God willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. I had lived my whole life among you before this ˹revelation˺. Do you not understand?”"
  10,17,"Who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against God or deny His revelations? Indeed, the wicked will never succeed"
  10,18,"They worship besides God others who can neither harm nor benefit them, and say, “These are our intercessors with God.” Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Are you informing God of something He does not know in the heavens or the earth? Glorified and Exalted is He above what they associate ˹with Him˺!”"
  10,19,"Humanity was once nothing but a single community ˹of believers˺, but then they differed. Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord, their differences would have been settled ˹at once˺"
  10,20,"They ask, “Why has no ˹other˺ sign been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹The knowledge of˺ the unseen is with God alone. So wait! I too am waiting with you.”"
