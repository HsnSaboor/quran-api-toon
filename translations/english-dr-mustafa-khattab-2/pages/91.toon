quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,80,"Whoever obeys the Messenger has truly obeyed God. But whoever turns away, then ˹know that˺ We have not sent you ˹O Prophet˺ as a keeper over them"
  4,81,"And they say, “We obey,” but when they leave you, a group of them would spend the night contradicting what they said. God records all their schemes. So turn away from them, and put your trust in God. And God is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs"
  4,82,"Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Had it been from anyone other than God, they would have certainly found in it many inconsistencies"
  4,83,"And when they hear news of security or fear, they publicize it. Had they referred it to the Messenger or their authorities, those with sound judgment among them would have validated it. Had it not been for God’s grace and mercy, you would have followed Satan—except for a few"
  4,84,"So fight in the cause of God ˹O Prophet˺. You are accountable for none but yourself. And motivate the believers ˹to fight˺, so perhaps God will curb the disbelievers’ might. And God is far superior in might and in punishment"
  4,85,"Whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a share in the reward, and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a share in the burden. And God is Watchful over all things"
  4,86,"And when you are greeted, respond with a better greeting or at least similarly. Surely God is a ˹vigilant˺ Reckoner of all things"
