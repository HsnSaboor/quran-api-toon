quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,11,"Indeed, those who came up with that ˹outrageous˺ slander are a group of you. Do not think this is bad for you. Rather, it is good for you. They will be punished, each according to their share of the sin. As for their mastermind, he will suffer a tremendous punishment"
  24,12,"If only the believing men and women had thought well of one another, when you heard this ˹rumour˺, and said, “This is clearly ˹an outrageous˺ slander!”"

  24,15,"when you passed it from one tongue to the other, and said with your mouths what you had no knowledge of, taking it lightly while it is ˹extremely˺ serious in the sight of God"
  24,16,"If only you had said upon hearing it, “How can we speak about such a thing! Glory be to You ˹O Lord˺! This is a heinous slander!”"
  24,17,"God forbids you from ever doing something like this again, if you are ˹true˺ believers"
  24,18,"And God makes ˹His˺ commandments clear to you, for God is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
