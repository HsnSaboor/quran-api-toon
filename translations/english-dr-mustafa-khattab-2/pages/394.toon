quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,71,"Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Imagine if God were to make the night perpetual for you until the Day of Judgment, which god other than God could bring you sunlight? Will you not then listen?”"
  28,72,"Ask ˹them also˺, “Imagine if God were to make the day perpetual for you until the Day of Judgment, which god other than God could bring you night to rest in? Will you not then see?”"
  28,73,"It is out of His mercy that He has made for you the day and night so that you may rest ˹in the latter˺ and seek His bounty ˹in the former˺, and perhaps you will be grateful"
  28,74,"And ˹watch for˺ the Day He will call to them, “Where are those you claimed were My associate-gods?”"
  28,75,"And We will bring forth a witness from every faith-community and ask ˹the polytheists˺, “Show ˹Us˺ your proof.” Then they will ˹come to˺ know that the truth is with God ˹alone˺. And whatever ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them"
  28,76,"Indeed, Korah was from the people of Moses, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. We had granted him such treasures that even their keys would burden a group of strong men. ˹Some of˺ his people advised him, “Do not be prideful! Surely God does not like the prideful"
  28,77,"Rather, seek the ˹reward˺ of the Hereafter by means of what God has granted you, without forgetting your share of this world. And be good ˹to others˺ as God has been good to you. Do not seek to spread corruption in the land, for God certainly does not like the corruptors.”"
