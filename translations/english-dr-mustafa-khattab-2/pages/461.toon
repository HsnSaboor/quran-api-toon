quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,"Can ˹the misguided be like˺ those whose hearts God has opened to Islam, so they are enlightened by their Lord? So woe to those whose hearts are hardened at the remembrance of God! It is they who are clearly astray"
  39,23,"˹It is˺ God ˹Who˺ has sent down the best message—a Book of perfect consistency and repeated lessons—which causes the skin ˹and hearts˺ of those who fear their Lord to tremble, then their skin and hearts soften at the mention of ˹the mercy of˺ God. That is the guidance of God, through which He guides whoever He wills. But whoever God leaves to stray will be left with no guide"
  39,24,"Are those who will only have their ˹bare˺ faces to shield themselves from the awful torment on Judgment Day ˹better than those in Paradise˺? It will ˹then˺ be said to the wrongdoers: “Reap what you sowed!”"
  39,25,"Those before them ˹also˺ rejected ˹the truth˺, then the torment came upon them from where they least expected"
  39,26,"So God made them taste humiliation in this worldly life, but far worse is the punishment of the Hereafter, if only they knew"
  39,27,"We have certainly set forth every ˹kind of˺ lesson for people in this Quran, so perhaps they will be mindful"
  39,28,"˹It is˺ a Quran ˹revealed˺ in Arabic without any crookedness, so perhaps they will be conscious ˹of God˺"
  39,29,"God sets forth the parable of a slave owned by several quarrelsome masters, and a slave owned by only one master. Are they equal in condition? Praise be to God! In fact, most of them do not know"
  39,30,"You ˹O Prophet˺ will certainly die, and they will die too"
  39,31,Then on the Day of Judgment you will ˹all settle your˺ dispute before your Lord
