quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,36,"Only the attentive will respond ˹to your call˺. As for the dead, God will raise them up, then to Him they will ˹all˺ be returned"
  6,37,"They ask, “Why has no ˹other˺ sign been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “God certainly has the power to send down a sign”—though most of them do not know"
  6,38,All living beings roaming the earth and winged birds soaring in the sky are communities like yourselves. We have left nothing out of the Record. Then to their Lord they will be gathered all together
  6,39,Those who deny Our signs are ˹wilfully˺ deaf and dumb—lost in darkness. God leaves whoever He wills to stray and guides whoever He wills to the Straight Way
  6,40,"Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Imagine if you were overwhelmed by God’s torment or the Hour—would you call upon any other than God ˹for help˺? ˹Answer me˺ if your claims are true"
  6,41,"No! He is the only One you would call. And if He willed, He could remove the affliction that made you invoke Him. Only then will you forget whatever you associate with Him ˹in worship˺.”"
  6,42,"Indeed, We have sent messengers before you ˹O Prophet˺ to other people who We put through suffering and adversity ˹for their denial˺, so perhaps they would be humbled"
  6,43,"Why did they not humble themselves when We made them suffer? Instead, their hearts were hardened, and Satan made their misdeeds appealing to them"
  6,44,"When they became oblivious to warnings, We showered them with everything they desired. But just as they became prideful of what they were given, We seized them by surprise, then they instantly fell into despair"
