quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"Say, “I have no power to benefit or protect myself, except by the Will of God. If I had known the unknown, I would have benefited myself enormously, and no harm would have ever touched me. I am only a warner and deliverer of good news for those who believe.”"
  7,189,"He is the One Who created you from a single soul, then from it made its spouse so he may find comfort in her. After he had been united with her, she carried a light burden that developed gradually. When it grew heavy, they prayed to God, their Lord, “If you grant us good offspring, we will certainly be grateful.”"
  7,190,"But when He granted their descendants good offspring, they associated false gods in what He has given them. Exalted is God above what they associate ˹with Him˺"
  7,191,"Do they associate ˹with God˺ those ˹idols˺ which cannot create anything, but are in fact created"
  7,192,"which cannot help them, or even help themselves"
  7,193,"And if you ˹idolaters˺ call upon them for guidance, they cannot respond to you. It is all the same whether you call them or remain silent"
  7,194,"Those ˹idols˺ you invoke besides God are created beings like yourselves. So call upon them and see if they will answer you, if your claims are true"
  7,195,"Do they have feet to walk with? Or hands to hold with? Or eyes to see with? Or ears to hear with? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Call upon your associate-gods and conspire against me without delay"
