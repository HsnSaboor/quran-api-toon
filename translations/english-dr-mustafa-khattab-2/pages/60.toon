quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,78,"There are some among them who distort the Book with their tongues to make you think this ˹distortion˺ is from the Book—but it is not what the Book says. They say, “It is from God”—but it is not from God. And ˹so˺ they attribute lies to God knowingly"
  3,79,"It is not appropriate for someone who God has blessed with the Scripture, wisdom, and prophethood to say to people, “Worship me instead of God.” Rather, he would say, “Be devoted to the worship of your Lord ˹alone˺”—in accordance with what these prophets read in the Scripture and what they taught"
  3,80,And he would never ask you to take angels and prophets as lords. Would he ask you to disbelieve after you have submitted
  3,81,"˹Remember˺ when God made a covenant with the prophets, ˹saying,˺ “Now that I have given you the Book and wisdom, if there comes to you a messenger confirming what you have, you must believe in him and support him.” He added, “Do you affirm this covenant and accept this commitment?” They said, “Yes, we do.” God said, “Then bear witness, and I too am a Witness.”"
  3,82,"Whoever turns back after this, they will be the rebellious"
  3,83,"Do they desire a way other than God’s—knowing that all those in the heavens and the earth submit to His Will, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they will ˹all˺ be returned"
