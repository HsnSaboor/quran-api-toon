quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,137,This is simply the tradition of our predecessors
  26,138,And we will never be punished.”
  26,139,"So they rejected him, and ˹so˺ We destroyed them. Surely in this is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe"
  26,140,"And your Lord is certainly the Almighty, Most Merciful"
  26,141,The people of Thamûd rejected the messengers
  26,142,"when their brother Ṣâliḥ said to them, “Will you not fear ˹God˺"
  26,143,I am truly a trustworthy messenger to you
  26,144,"So fear God, and obey me"
  26,145,I do not ask you for any reward for this ˹message˺. My reward is only from the Lord of all worlds
  26,146,Do you think you will be ˹forever˺ left secure in what you have here
  26,147,amid gardens and springs
  26,148,"and ˹various˺ crops, and palm trees ˹loaded˺ with tender fruit"
  26,149,to carve homes in the mountains with great skill
  26,150,"So fear God, and obey me"
  26,151,And do not follow the command of the transgressors
  26,152,"who spread corruption throughout the land, never setting things right.”"
  26,153,"They replied, “You are simply bewitched"
  26,154,"You are only a human being like us, so bring forth a sign if what you say is true.”"
  26,155,"Ṣâliḥ said, “Here is a camel. She will have her turn to drink as you have yours, each on an appointed day"
  26,156,"And do not ever touch her with harm, or you will be overtaken by the torment of a tremendous day.”"
  26,157,"But they killed her, becoming regretful"
  26,158,So the punishment overtook them. Surely in this is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe
  26,159,"And your Lord is certainly the Almighty, Most Merciful"
