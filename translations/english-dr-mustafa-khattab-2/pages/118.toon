quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,58,"When you call to prayer, they mock it in amusement. This is because they are a people without understanding"
  5,59,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O People of the Book! Do you resent us only because we believe in God and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed before—while most of you are rebellious?”"
  5,60,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Shall I inform you of those who deserve a worse punishment from God ˹than the rebellious˺? It is those who earned God’s condemnation and displeasure—some being reduced to apes and pigs and worshippers of false gods. These are far worse in rank and farther astray from the Right Way.”"
  5,61,"When they come to you ˹believers˺ they say, “We believe.” But they are committed to disbelief when they enter and when they leave. And God knows what they hide"
  5,62,"You see many of them racing towards sin, transgression, and consumption of forbidden gain. Evil indeed are their actions"
  5,63,Why do their rabbis and scholars not forbid them from saying what is sinful and consuming what is unlawful? Evil indeed is their inaction
  5,64,"˹Some among˺ the Jews said, “God is tight-fisted.” May their fists be tied and they be condemned for what they said. Rather, He is open-handed, giving freely as He pleases. That which has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ from your Lord will only cause many of them to increase in wickedness and disbelief. We have stirred among them hostility and hatred until the Day of Judgment. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, God puts it out. And they strive to spread corruption in the land. And God does not like corruptors"
