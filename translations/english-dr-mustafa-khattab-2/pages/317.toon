  20,77,"And We surely inspired Moses, ˹saying,˺ “Leave with My servants ˹at night˺ and strike a dry passage for them across the sea. Have no fear of being overtaken, nor be concerned ˹of drowning˺.”"
  20,78,Then Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers—but how overwhelming were the waters that submerged them
  20,79,"And ˹so˺ Pharaoh led his people astray, and did not guide ˹them rightly˺"
  20,80,"O Children of Israel! We saved you from your enemy, and made an appointment with you on the right side of Mount Ṭûr, and sent down to you manna and quails"
  20,81,"˹saying,˺ “Eat from the good things We have provided for you, but do not transgress in them, or My wrath will befall you. And whoever My wrath befalls is certainly doomed"
  20,82,"But I am truly Most Forgiving to whoever repents, believes, and does good, then persists on ˹true˺ guidance.”"
  20,83,"˹God asked,˺ “Why have you come with such haste ahead of your people, O Moses?”"
  20,84,"He replied, “They are close on my tracks. And I have hastened to You, my Lord, so You will be pleased.”"
  20,85,"God responded, “We have indeed tested your people in your absence, and the Sâmiri has led them astray.”"
  20,86,"So Moses returned to his people, furious and sorrowful. He said, “O my people! Had your Lord not made you a good promise? Has my absence been too long for you? Or have you wished for wrath from your Lord to befall you, so you broke your promise to me?”"
  20,87,"They argued, “We did not break our promise to you of our own free will, but we were made to carry the burden of the people’s ˹golden˺ jewellery, then we threw it ˹into the fire˺, and so did the Sâmiri.”"
