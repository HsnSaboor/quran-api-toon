quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,38,"God will say, “Enter the Fire along with the ˹evil˺ groups of jinn and humans that preceded you.” Whenever a group enters Hell, it will curse the preceding one until they are all gathered inside, the followers will say about their leaders, “Our Lord! They have misled us, so multiply their torment in the Fire.” He will answer, “It has already been multiplied for all, but you do not know.”"
  7,39,"Then the leaders will say to their followers, “You were no better than us! So taste the torment for what you used to commit.”"
  7,40,"Surely those who receive our revelations with denial and arrogance, the gates of heaven will not be opened for them, nor will they enter Paradise until a camel passes through the eye of a needle. This is how We reward the wicked"
  7,41,Hell will be their bed; flames will be their cover. This is how We reward the wrongdoers
  7,42,As for those who believe and do good—We never require of any soul more than what it can afford—it is they who will be the residents of Paradise. They will be there forever
  7,43,"We will remove whatever bitterness they had in their hearts. Rivers will flow under their feet. And they will say, “Praise be to God for guiding us to this. We would have never been guided if God had not guided us. The messengers of our Lord had certainly come with the truth.” It will be announced to them, “This is Paradise awarded to you for what you used to do.”"
