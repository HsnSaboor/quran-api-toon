quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,1,Alif-Lãm-Mĩm
  3,2,"God! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him—the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining"
  3,3,"He has revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ the Book in truth, confirming what came before it, as He revealed the Torah and the Gospel"
  3,4,"previously, as a guide for people, and ˹also˺ revealed the Standard ˹to distinguish between right and wrong˺. Surely those who reject God’s revelations will suffer a severe torment. For God is Almighty, capable of punishment"
  3,5,Surely nothing on earth or in the heavens is hidden from God
  3,6,"He is the One Who shapes you in the wombs of your mothers as He wills. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him—the Almighty, All-Wise"
  3,7,"He is the One Who has revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ the Book, of which some verses are precise—they are the foundation of the Book—while others are elusive. Those with deviant hearts follow the elusive verses seeking ˹to spread˺ doubt through their ˹false˺ interpretations—but none grasps their ˹full˺ meaning except God. As for those well-grounded in knowledge, they say, “We believe in this ˹Quran˺—it is all from our Lord.” But none will be mindful ˹of this˺ except people of reason"
  3,8,"˹They say,˺ “Our Lord! Do not let our hearts deviate after you have guided us. Grant us Your mercy. You are indeed the Giver ˹of all bounties˺"
  3,9,Our Lord! You will certainly gather all humanity for the ˹promised˺ Day—about which there is no doubt. Surely God does not break His promise.”
