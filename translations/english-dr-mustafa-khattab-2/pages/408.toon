quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  30,33,"When people are touched with hardship, they cry out to their Lord, turning to Him ˹alone˺. But as soon as He gives them a taste of His mercy, a group of them associates ˹others˺ with their Lord ˹in worship˺"
  30,34,"becoming ungrateful for whatever ˹favours˺ We have given them. So enjoy yourselves, for soon you will know"
  30,35,Or have We sent down to them an authority which attests to what they associate ˹with Him˺
  30,36,"If We give people a taste of mercy, they become prideful ˹because˺ of it. But if they are afflicted with an evil for what their hands have done, they instantly fall into despair"
  30,37,Have they not seen that God gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills? Surely in this are signs for people who believe
  30,38,"So give your close relatives their due, as well as the poor and the ˹needy˺ traveller. That is best for those who seek the pleasure of God, and it is they who will be successful"
  30,39,"Whatever loans you give, ˹only˺ seeking interest at the expense of people’s wealth will not increase with God. But whatever charity you give, ˹only˺ seeking the pleasure of God—it is they whose reward will be multiplied"
  30,40,"It is God Who created you, then gives you provisions, then will cause you to die, and then will bring you back to life. Can any of your associate-gods do any of this? Glorified and Exalted is He above what they associate with Him ˹in worship˺"
  30,41,"Corruption has spread on land and sea as a result of what people’s hands have done, so that God may cause them to taste ˹the consequences of˺ some of their deeds and perhaps they might return ˹to the Right Path˺"
