quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,120,"Never will the Jews or Christians be pleased with you, until you follow their faith. Say, “God’s guidance is the only ˹true˺ guidance.” And if you were to follow their desires after ˹all˺ the knowledge that has come to you, there would be none to protect or help you against God"
  2,121,"Those We have given the Book follow it as it should be followed. It is they who ˹truly˺ believe in it. As for those who reject it, it is they who are the losers"
  2,122,O Children of Israel! Remember My favours upon you and how I honoured you above the others
  2,123,"And guard yourselves against the Day when no soul will be of any help to another. No ransom will be taken, no intercession accepted, and no help will be given"
  2,124,"˹Remember˺ when Abraham was tested by his Lord with ˹certain˺ commandments, which he fulfilled. God said, “I will certainly make you into a role model for the people.” Abraham asked, “What about my offspring?” God replied, “My covenant is not extended to the wrongdoers.”"
  2,125,"And ˹remember˺ when We made the Sacred House a centre and a sanctuary for the people ˹saying˺, “˹You may˺ take the standing-place of Abraham as a site of prayer.” And We entrusted Abraham and Ishmael to purify My House for those who circle it, who meditate in it, and who bow and prostrate themselves ˹in prayer˺"
  2,126,"And ˹remember˺ when Abraham said, “My Lord, make this city ˹of Mecca˺ secure and provide fruits to its people—those among them who believe in God and the Last Day.” He answered, “As for those who disbelieve, I will let them enjoy themselves for a little while, then I will condemn them to the torment of the Fire. What an evil destination!”"
