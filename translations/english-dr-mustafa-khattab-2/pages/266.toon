quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  15,71,"He said, “O my people! Here are my daughters ˹so marry them˺ if you wish to do so.”"
  15,72,"By your life ˹O Prophet˺, they certainly wandered blindly, intoxicated ˹by lust˺"
  15,73,So the ˹mighty˺ blast overtook them at sunrise
  15,74,And We turned the cities ˹of Sodom and Gomorrah˺ upside down and rained upon them stones of baked clay
  15,75,Surely in this are signs for those who contemplate
  15,76,Their ruins still lie along a known route
  15,77,Surely in this is a sign for those who believe
  15,78,And the residents of the Forest were truly wrongdoers
  15,79,so We inflicted punishment upon them. The ruins of both nations still lie on a well-known road
  15,80,"Indeed, the residents of the Stone Valley also denied the messengers"
  15,81,"We gave them Our signs, but they turned away from them"
  15,82,"They carved their homes in the mountains, feeling secure"
  15,83,But the ˹mighty˺ blast overtook them in the morning
  15,84,and all they achieved was of no help to them
  15,85,"We have not created the heavens and the earth and everything in between except for a purpose. And the Hour is certain to come, so forgive graciously"
  15,86,"Surely your Lord is the Master Creator, All-Knowing"
  15,87,We have certainly granted you the seven often-repeated verses and the great Quran
  15,88,"Do not let your eyes crave the ˹fleeting˺ pleasures We have provided for some of the disbelievers, nor grieve for them. And be gracious to the believers"
  15,89,"And say, “I am truly sent with a clear warning”—"
  15,90,˹a warning˺ similar to what We sent to those who divided ˹the Scriptures˺
