quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,His Lord called him in the sacred valley of Ṭuwa
  79,17,"˹commanding,˺ “Go to Pharaoh, for he has truly transgressed ˹all bounds˺"
  79,18,"And say, ‘Would you ˹be willing to˺ purify yourself"
  79,19,and let me guide you to your Lord so that you will be in awe ˹of Him˺?’”
  79,20,Then Moses showed him the great sign
  79,21,but he denied and disobeyed ˹God˺
  79,22,"then turned his back, striving ˹against the truth˺"
  79,23,Then he summoned ˹his people˺ and called out
  79,24,"saying, “I am your lord, the most high!”"
  79,25,"So God overtook him, making him an example in this life and the next"
  79,26,Surely in this is a lesson for whoever stands in awe of ˹God˺
  79,27,"Which is harder to create: you or the sky? He built it"
  79,28,raising it high and forming it flawlessly
  79,29,"He dimmed its night, and brought forth its daylight"
  79,30,"As for the earth, He spread it out as well"
  79,31,bringing forth its water and pastures
  79,32,and setting the mountains firmly ˹upon it˺—
  79,33,all as ˹a means of˺ sustenance for you and your animals
  79,34,"But, when the Supreme Disaster comes to pass—"
  79,35,the Day every person will remember all ˹their˺ striving
  79,36,and the Hellfire will be displayed for all to see—
  79,37,then as for those who transgressed
  79,38,and preferred the ˹fleeting˺ life of this world
  79,39,the Hellfire will certainly be ˹their˺ home
  79,40,And as for those who were in awe of standing before their Lord and restrained themselves from ˹evil˺ desires
  79,41,Paradise will certainly be ˹their˺ home
  79,42,"They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the Hour, “When will it be?”"
  79,43,But it is not for you to tell its time
  79,44,That knowledge rests with your Lord ˹alone˺
  79,45,Your duty is only to warn whoever is in awe of it
  79,46,"On the Day they see it, it will be as if they had stayed ˹in the world˺ no more than one evening or its morning"
