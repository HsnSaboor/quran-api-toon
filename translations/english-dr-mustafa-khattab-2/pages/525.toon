quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  52,32,Or do their ˹intelligent˺ minds prompt them to this ˹paradox˺? Or are they ˹just˺ a transgressing people
  52,33,"Or do they say, “He made this ˹Quran˺ up!”? In fact, they have no faith"
  52,34,"Let them then produce something like it, if what they say is true"
  52,35,"Or were they created by nothing, or are they ˹their own˺ creators"
  52,36,"Or did they create the heavens and the earth? In fact, they have no firm belief ˹in God˺"
  52,37,"Or do they possess the treasuries of your Lord, or are they in control ˹of everything˺"
  52,38,"Or do they have a stairway, by which they eavesdrop ˹on the heavens˺? Then let those who do so bring a compelling proof"
  52,39,"Or does He have daughters ˹as you claim˺, while you ˹prefer to˺ have sons"
  52,40,Or are you ˹O Prophet˺ asking them for a reward ˹for the message˺ so that they are overburdened by debt
  52,41,"Or do they have access to ˹the Record in˺ the unseen, so they copy it ˹for all to see˺"
  52,42,Or do they intend to scheme ˹against the Prophet˺? Then it is the disbelievers who will fall victim to ˹their˺ schemes
  52,43,Or do they have a god other than God? Glorified is God far above what they associate ˹with Him˺
  52,44,"If they were to see a ˹deadly˺ piece of the sky fall down ˹upon them˺, still they would say, “˹This is just˺ a pile of clouds.”"
  52,45,So leave them until they face their Day in which they will be struck dead—
  52,46,"the Day their scheming will be of no benefit to them whatsoever, nor will they be helped"
  52,47,"Also, the wrongdoers will certainly have another torment before that ˹Day˺, but most of them do not know"
  52,48,"So be patient with your Lord’s decree, for you are truly under Our ˹watchful˺ Eyes. And glorify the praises of your Lord when you rise"
  52,49,And glorify Him during part of the night and at the fading of the stars
