quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  27,36,"When the chief-envoy came to him, Solomon said, “Do you offer me wealth? What God has granted me is far greater than what He has granted you. No! It is you who rejoice in ˹receiving˺ gifts"
  27,37,"Go back to them, for we will certainly mobilize against them forces which they can never resist, and we will drive them out from there in disgrace, fully humbled.”"
  27,38,"Solomon asked, “O chiefs! Which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in ˹full˺ submission?”"
  27,39,"One mighty jinn responded, “I can bring it to you before you rise from this council of yours. And I am quite strong and trustworthy for this ˹task˺.”"
  27,40,"But the one who had knowledge of the Scripture said, “I can bring it to you in the blink of an eye.” So when Solomon saw it placed before him, he exclaimed, “This is by the grace of my Lord to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful. And whoever is grateful, it is only for their own good. But whoever is ungrateful, surely my Lord is Self-Sufficient, Most Generous.”"
  27,41,"˹Then˺ Solomon said, “Disguise her throne for her so we may see whether she will recognize ˹it˺ or she will not be able to.”"
  27,42,"So when she arrived, it was said ˹to her˺, “Is your throne like this?” She replied, “It looks to be the same. We have ˹already˺ received knowledge ˹of Solomon’s prophethood˺ before this ˹miracle˺, and have submitted ˹to God˺.”"
  27,43,"But she had been hindered by what she used to worship instead of God, for she was indeed from a disbelieving people"
  27,44,"Then she was told, “Enter the palace.” But when she saw the hall, she thought it was a body of water, so she bared her legs. Solomon said. “It is just a palace paved with crystal.” ˹At last˺ she declared, “My Lord! I have certainly wronged my soul. Now I ˹fully˺ submit myself along with Solomon to God, the Lord of all worlds.”"
