quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,41,"O my people! How is it that I invite you to salvation, while you invite me to the Fire"
  40,42,"You invite me to disbelieve in God and associate with Him what I have no knowledge of, while I invite you to the Almighty, Most Forgiving"
  40,43,"There is no doubt that whatever ˹idols˺ you invite me to ˹worship˺ are not worthy to be invoked either in this world or the Hereafter. ˹Undoubtedly,˺ our return is to God, and the transgressors will be the inmates of the Fire"
  40,44,"You will remember what I say to you, and I entrust my affairs to God. Surely God is All-Seeing of all ˹His˺ servants.”"
  40,45,So God protected him from the evil of their schemes. And Pharaoh’s people were overwhelmed by an evil punishment
  40,46,"they are exposed to the Fire ˹in their graves˺ morning and evening. And on the Day the Hour will be established ˹it will be said˺, “Admit Pharaoh’s people into the harshest punishment ˹of Hell˺.”"
  40,47,"˹Consider the Day˺ when they will dispute in the Fire, and the lowly ˹followers˺ will appeal to the arrogant ˹leaders˺, “We were your ˹dedicated˺ followers, will you then shield us from a portion of the Fire?”"
  40,48,"The arrogant will say, “We are all in it! ˹For˺ God has already passed judgment over ˹His˺ servants.”"
  40,49,"And those in the Fire will cry out to the keepers of Hell, “Pray to your Lord to lighten the torment for us ˹even˺ for one day!”"
