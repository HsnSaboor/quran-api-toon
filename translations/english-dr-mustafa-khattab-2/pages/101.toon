quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"˹The hypocrites are˺ those who wait to see what happens to you. So if God grants you victory, they say ˹to you˺, “Were we not on your side?” But if the disbelievers have a share ˹of victory˺, they say ˹to them˺, “Did we not have the advantage over you, yet we protected you from the believers?” God will judge between ˹all of˺ you on the Day of Judgment. And God will never grant the disbelievers a way over the believers"
  4,142,"Surely the hypocrites seek to deceive God, but He outwits them. When they stand up for prayer, they do it half-heartedly only to be seen by people—hardly remembering God at all"
  4,143,"Torn between belief and disbelief—belonging neither to these ˹believers˺ nor those ˹disbelievers˺. And whoever God leaves to stray, you will never find for them a way"
  4,144,O believers! Do not take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Would you like to give God solid proof against yourselves
  4,145,Surely the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire—and you will never find for them any helper—
  4,146,"except those who repent, mend their ways, hold fast to God, and are sincere in their devotion to God; they will be with the believers. And God will grant the believers a great reward"
  4,147,"Why should God punish you if you are grateful and faithful? God is ever Appreciative, All-Knowing"
