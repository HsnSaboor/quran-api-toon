quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By the ˹passage of˺ time
  103,2,Surely humanity is in ˹grave˺ loss
  103,3,"except those who have faith, do good, and urge each other to the truth, and urge each other to perseverance"
  104,1,"Woe to every backbiter, slanderer"
  104,2,who amasses wealth ˹greedily˺ and counts it ˹repeatedly˺
  104,3,thinking that their wealth will make them immortal
  104,4,Not at all! Such a person will certainly be tossed into the Crusher
  104,5,And what will make you realize what the Crusher is
  104,6,˹It is˺ God’s kindled Fire
  104,7,which rages over the hearts
  104,8,It will be sealed over them
  104,9,˹tightly secured˺ with long braces
  105,1,Have you not seen ˹O Prophet˺ how your Lord dealt with the Army of the Elephant
  105,2,Did He not frustrate their scheme
  105,3,For He sent against them flocks of birds
  105,4,that pelted them with stones of baked clay
  105,5,leaving them like chewed up straw
