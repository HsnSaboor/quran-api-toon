quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  15,16,"Indeed, We have placed constellations in the sky, and adorned it for all to see"
  15,17,And We protected it from every accursed devil
  15,18,"except the one eavesdropping, who is then pursued by a visible flare"
  15,19,"As for the earth, We spread it out and placed upon it firm mountains, and caused everything to grow there in perfect balance"
  15,20,"And We made in it means of sustenance for you and others, who you do not provide for"
  15,21,"There is not any means ˹of sustenance˺ whose reserves We do not hold, only bringing it forth in precise measure"
  15,22,"We send fertilizing winds, and bring down rain from the sky for you to drink. It is not you who hold its reserves"
  15,23,Surely it is We Who give life and cause death. And We are the ˹Eternal˺ Successor
  15,24,We certainly know those who have gone before you and those who will come after ˹you˺
  15,25,"Surely your Lord ˹alone˺ will gather them together ˹for judgment˺. He is truly All-Wise, All-Knowing"
  15,26,"Indeed, We created man from sounding clay moulded from black mud"
  15,27,"As for the jinn, We created them earlier from smokeless fire"
  15,28,"˹Remember, O Prophet˺ when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to create a human being from sounding clay moulded from black mud"
  15,29,"So when I have fashioned him and had a spirit of My Own ˹creation˺ breathed into him, fall down in prostration to him.”"
  15,30,So the angels prostrated all together—
  15,31,"but not Iblîs, who refused to prostrate with the others"
