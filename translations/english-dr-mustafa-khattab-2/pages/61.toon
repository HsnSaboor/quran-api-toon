  3,84,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “We believe in God and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants; and what was given to Moses, Jesus, and other prophets from their Lord—we make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we ˹fully˺ submit.”"

  3,86,"How will God guide a people who chose to disbelieve after they had believed, acknowledged the Messenger to be true, and received clear proofs? For God does not guide the wrongdoing people"
  3,87,"Their reward is that they will be condemned by God, the angels, and all of humanity"
  3,88,"They will be in Hell forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be delayed ˹from it˺"
  3,89,"As for those who repent afterwards and mend their ways, then surely God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  3,90,"Indeed, those who disbelieve after having believed then increase in disbelief, their repentance will never be accepted. It is they who are astray"
  3,91,"Indeed, if each of those who disbelieve then die as disbelievers were to offer a ransom of enough gold to fill the whole world, it would never be accepted from them. It is they who will suffer a painful punishment, and they will have no helpers"
