quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  26,1,Ṭâ-Sĩn-Mĩm
  26,2,These are the verses of the clear Book
  26,3,Perhaps you ˹O Prophet˺ will grieve yourself to death over their disbelief
  26,4,"If We willed, We could send down upon them a ˹compelling˺ sign from the heavens, leaving their necks bent in ˹utter˺ submission to it"
  26,5,"Whatever new reminder comes to them from the Most Compassionate, they always turn away from it"
  26,6,"They have certainly denied ˹the truth˺, so they will soon face the consequences of their ridicule"
  26,7,"Have they failed to look at the earth, ˹to see˺ how many types of fine plants We have caused to grow in it"
  26,8,Surely in this is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe
  26,9,"And your Lord is certainly the Almighty, Most Merciful"
  26,10,"˹Remember˺ when your Lord called out to Moses, “Go to the wrongdoing people—"
  26,11,the people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear ˹God˺?”
  26,12,"He replied, “My Lord! I fear that they will reject me"
  26,13,And ˹so˺ my heart will be broken and my tongue will be tied. So send Aaron along ˹as a messenger˺
  26,14,"Also, they have a charge against me, so I fear they may kill me.”"
  26,15,"God responded, “Certainly not! So go, both of you, with Our signs. We will be with you, listening"
  26,16,"Go to Pharaoh and say, ‘We are messengers from the Lord of all worlds"
  26,17,"˹commanded to say:˺ ‘Let the Children of Israel go with us.’’”"
  26,18,"Pharaoh protested, “Did we not raise you among us as a child, and you stayed several years of your life in our care"
  26,19,"Then you did what you did, being ˹utterly˺ ungrateful!”"
