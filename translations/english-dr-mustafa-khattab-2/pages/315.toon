  20,52,"He replied, “That knowledge is with my Lord in a Record. My Lord neither falters nor forgets ˹anything˺.”"
  20,53,"˹He is the One˺ Who has laid out the earth for ˹all of˺ you, and set in it pathways for you, and sends down rain from the sky, causing various types of plants to grow"

  20,57,"He said, “Have you come to drive us out of our land with your magic, O Moses"
  20,58,"We can surely meet you with similar magic. So set for us an appointment that neither of us will fail to keep, in a central place.”"
