quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  10,43,"And some of them look at you, but can you guide the blind even though they cannot see"
  10,44,"Indeed, God does not wrong people in the least, but it is people who wrong themselves"
  10,45,"On the Day He will gather them, it will be as if they had not stayed ˹in the world˺ except for an hour of a day, ˹as though they were only˺ getting to know one another. Lost indeed will be those who denied the meeting with God, and were not ˹rightly˺ guided"
  10,46,"Whether We show you ˹O Prophet˺ some of what We threaten them with, or cause you to die ˹before that˺, to Us is their return and God is a Witness over what they do"
  10,47,"And for every community there is a messenger. After their messenger has come, judgment is passed on them in all fairness, and they are not wronged"
  10,48,"They ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass if what you say is true?”"
  10,49,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I have no power to benefit or protect myself, except by the Will of God.” For each community there is an appointed term. When their time arrives, they cannot delay it for a moment, nor could they advance it"
  10,50,"Tell them ˹O Prophet˺, “Imagine if His torment were to overcome you by night or day—do the wicked realize what they are ˹really˺ asking Him to hasten"
  10,51,Will you believe in it only after it has overtaken you? Now? But you always wanted to hasten it!”
  10,52,"Then the wrongdoers will be told, “Taste the torment of eternity! Are you not rewarded except for what you used to commit?”"
  10,53,"They ask you ˹O Prophet˺, “Is this true?” Say, “Yes, by my Lord! Most certainly it is true! And you will have no escape.”"
