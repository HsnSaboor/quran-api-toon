quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,32,"The arrogant will respond to the lowly, “Did we ever hinder you from guidance after it came to you? In fact, you were wicked ˹on your own˺.”"
  34,33,"The lowly will say to the arrogant, “No! It was your plotting by day and night—when you ordered us to disbelieve in God and to set up equals with Him.” They will ˹all˺ hide ˹their˺ remorse when they see the torment. And We will put shackles around the necks of the disbelievers. Will they be rewarded except for what they used to do"
  34,34,"Whenever We sent a warner to a society, its elite would say, “We truly reject what you have been sent with.”"

  34,36,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Surely ˹it is˺ my Lord ˹Who˺ gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills. But most people do not know.”"
  34,37,"It is not your wealth or children that bring you closer to Us. But those who believe and do good—it is they who will have a multiplied reward for what they did, and they will be secure in ˹elevated˺ mansions"
  34,38,"As for those who strive to discredit Our revelations, it is they who will be confined in punishment"
  34,39,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Surely ˹it is˺ my Lord ˹Who˺ gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills of His servants. And whatever you spend in charity, He will compensate ˹you˺ for it. For He is the Best Provider.”"
