quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  33,16,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Fleeing will not benefit you if you ˹try to˺ escape a natural or violent death. ˹If it is not your time,˺ you will only be allowed enjoyment for a little while.”"
  33,17,"Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Who can put you out of God’s reach if He intends to harm you or show you mercy?” They can never find any protector or helper besides God"
  33,18,"God knows well those among you who discourage ˹others from fighting˺, saying ˹secretly˺ to their brothers, “Stay with us,” and who themselves hardly take part in fighting"
  33,19,"˹They are˺ totally unwilling to assist you. When danger comes, you see them staring at you with their eyes rolling like someone in the throes of death. But once the danger is over, they slash you with razor-sharp tongues, ravenous for ˹worldly˺ gains. Such people have not ˹truly˺ believed, so God has rendered their deeds void. And that is easy for God"
  33,20,"They ˹still˺ think that the enemy alliance has not ˹yet˺ withdrawn. And if the allies were to come ˹again˺, the hypocrites would wish to be away in the desert among nomadic Arabs, ˹only˺ asking for news about you ˹believers˺. And if the hypocrites were in your midst, they would hardly take part in the fight"
  33,21,"Indeed, in the Messenger of God you have an excellent example for whoever has hope in God and the Last Day, and remembers God often"
  33,22,"When the believers saw the enemy alliance, they said, “This is what God and His Messenger had promised us. The promise of God and His Messenger has come true.” And this only increased them in faith and submission"
