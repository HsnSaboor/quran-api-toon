quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,40,"And ˹consider˺ the Day He will gather them all together, and then ask the angels, “Was it you that these ˹polytheists˺ used to worship?”"
  34,41,"They will say, “Glory be to You! Our loyalty is to You, not them. In fact, they ˹only˺ followed the ˹temptations of evil˺ jinn, in whom most of them had faith.”"
  34,42,"So Today neither of you can benefit or protect each other. And We will say to the wrongdoers, “Taste the torment of the Fire, which you used to deny.”"
  34,43,"When Our clear revelations are recited to them, they say, “This is only a man who wishes to hinder you from what your forefathers used to worship.” They also say, “This ˹Quran˺ is no more than a fabricated lie.” And the disbelievers say of the truth when it has come to them, “This is nothing but pure magic.”"
  34,44,"˹They say so even though˺ We had never given them any scriptures to study, nor did We ever send them a warner before you ˹O Prophet˺"
  34,45,"Those ˹destroyed˺ before them denied as well—and these ˹Meccans˺ have not attained even one-tenth of what We had given their predecessors. Yet ˹when˺ they denied My messengers, how severe was My response"
  34,46,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I advise you to do ˹only˺ one thing: stand up for ˹the sake of˺ God—individually or in pairs—then reflect. Your fellow man is not insane. He is only a warner to you before ˹the coming of˺ a severe punishment.”"
  34,47,"Say, “If I had ever asked you for a reward, you could keep it. My reward is only from God. And He is a Witness over all things.”"
  34,48,"Say, “Surely my Lord hurls the truth ˹against falsehood˺. ˹He is˺ the Knower of all unseen.”"
