quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  13,6,"They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ to hasten the torment rather than grace, though there have ˹already˺ been ˹many˺ torments before them. Surely your Lord is full of forgiveness for people, despite their wrongdoing, and your Lord is truly severe in punishment"
  13,7,"The disbelievers say, “If only a sign could be sent down to him from his Lord.” You ˹O Prophet˺ are only a warner. And every people had a guide"
  13,8,God knows what every female bears and what increases and decreases in the wombs. And with Him everything is determined with precision
  13,9,"˹He is the˺ Knower of the seen and the unseen—the All-Great, Most Exalted"
  13,10,"It is the same ˹to Him˺ whether any of you speaks secretly or openly, whether one hides in the darkness of night or goes about in broad daylight"
  13,11,"For each one there are successive angels before and behind, protecting them by God’s command. Indeed, God would never change a people’s state ˹of favour˺ until they change their own state ˹of faith˺. And if it is God’s Will to torment a people, it can never be averted, nor can they find a protector other than Him"
  13,12,"He is the One Who shows you lightning, inspiring ˹you with˺ hope and fear, and produces heavy clouds"
  13,13,"The thunder glorifies His praises, as do the angels in awe of Him. He sends thunderbolts, striking with them whoever He wills. Yet they dispute about God. And He is tremendous in might"
