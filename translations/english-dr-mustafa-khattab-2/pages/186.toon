quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  8,70,"O Prophet! Tell the captives in your custody, “If God finds goodness in your hearts, He will give you better than what has been taken from you, and forgive you. For God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”"
  8,71,"But if their intention is only to betray you ˹O Prophet˺, they sought to betray God before. But He gave you power over them. And God is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  8,72,"Those who believed, emigrated, and strived with their wealth and lives in the cause of God, as well as those who gave them shelter and help—they are truly guardians of one another. As for those who believed but did not emigrate, you have no obligations to them until they emigrate. But if they seek your help ˹against persecution˺ in faith, it is your obligation to help them, except against people bound with you in a treaty. God is All-Seeing of what you do"
  8,73,"As for the disbelievers, they are guardians of one another. And unless you ˹believers˺ act likewise, there will be great oppression and corruption in the land"
  8,74,"Those who believed, migrated, and struggled in the cause of God, and those who gave ˹them˺ shelter and help, they are the true believers. They will have forgiveness and an honourable provision"
  8,75,"And those who later believed, migrated, and struggled alongside you, they are also with you. But only blood relatives are now entitled to inherit from one another, as ordained by God. Surely God has ˹full˺ knowledge of everything"
