  3,71,O People of the Book! Why do you mix the truth with falsehood and hide the truth knowingly

And God is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.”"
  3,74,He chooses whoever He wills to receive His mercy. And God is the Lord of infinite bounty
  3,75,"There are some among the People of the Book who, if entrusted with a stack of gold, will readily return it.
