quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,78,"We already sent messengers before you. We have told you the stories of some of them, while others We have not. It was not for any messenger to bring a sign without God’s permission. But when God’s decree comes, judgment will be passed with fairness, and the people of falsehood will then be in ˹total˺ loss"
  40,79,It is God Who made cattle for you so that you may ride some and eat others
  40,80,"Also, you find in them ˹other˺ benefits. And by means of them you may reach destinations you desire. And you are carried upon ˹some of˺ them and upon ships"
  40,81,And He shows you His signs. Now which of God’s signs will you deny
  40,82,"Have they not travelled throughout the land to see what was the end of those who were ˹destroyed˺ before them? They were far superior in might and ˹richer in˺ monuments throughout the land, but their ˹worldly˺ gains were of no benefit to them"
  40,83,"When their messengers came to them with clear proofs, they were prideful in whatever ˹worldly˺ knowledge they had, and were ˹ultimately˺ overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule"
  40,84,"When they saw Our punishment, they cried, “˹Now˺ we believe in God alone and reject what we had been associating with Him!”"
  40,85,But their faith was of no benefit to them when they saw Our torment. This has ˹always˺ been God’s way ˹of dealing˺ with His ˹wicked˺ servants. Then and there the disbelievers were in ˹total˺ loss
