quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  48,16,"Say to nomadic Arabs, who stayed behind, “You will be called ˹to fight˺ against a people of great might, who you will fight unless they submit. If you then obey, God will grant you a fine reward. But if you turn away as you did before, He will inflict upon you a painful punishment.”"
  48,17,"There is no blame on the blind, or the disabled, or the sick ˹for staying behind˺. And whoever obeys God and His Messenger will be admitted by Him into Gardens under which rivers flow. But whoever turns away will be subjected by Him to a painful punishment"
  48,18,"Indeed, God was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you ˹O Prophet˺ under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down serenity upon them and rewarded them with a victory at hand"
  48,19,"and many spoils of war they will gain. For God is Almighty, All-Wise"
  48,20,"God has promised you ˹believers˺ abundant spoils, which you will gain, so He hastened this ˹truce˺ for you. And He has held people’s hands back from ˹harming˺ you, so it may be a sign for the believers, and so He may guide you along the Straight Path"
  48,21,And ˹there are˺ other gains which are beyond your reach that God is keeping in store ˹for you˺. For God is Most Capable of everything
  48,22,"If the disbelievers were to fight you, they would certainly flee. Then they would never find any protector or helper"
  48,23,"˹This is˺ God’s way, already long established ˹in the past˺. And you will find no change in God’s way"
