quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  28,60,Whatever ˹pleasure˺ you have been given is no more than ˹a fleeting˺ enjoyment and adornment of this worldly life. But what is with God is far better and more lasting. Will you not then understand
  28,61,"Can those to whom We have made a fine promise—which they will see fulfilled—be like those who We have allowed to enjoy the pleasures of this worldly life, but on the Day of Judgment will be brought ˹for punishment˺"
  28,62,"˹Watch for˺ the Day He will call to them, “Where are those you claimed were My associate-gods?”"
  28,63,"Those ˹misleaders˺ against whom the decree ˹of torment˺ is justified will cry, “Our Lord! These ˹followers˺ are the ones we caused to deviate. We led them into deviance, for we ourselves were deviant. We disassociate ourselves ˹from them˺ before You. It was not us that they used to worship.”"
  28,64,"It will be said ˹to the disbelievers˺, “Call upon your associate-gods ˹for help˺.” So they will call them, but will receive no response. And they will face the punishment, wishing they had been ˹rightly˺ guided"
  28,65,"And ˹watch for˺ the Day He will call to them, asking, “What response did you give to the messengers?”"
  28,66,They will be too dumbstruck on that Day to ask one another ˹for answers˺
  28,67,"As for those who repent, believe, and do good ˹in this world˺, it is right to hope that they will be among the successful"
  28,68,Your Lord creates and chooses whatever He wills—the choice is not theirs. Glorified and Exalted is God above what they associate ˹with Him˺
  28,69,And your Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they reveal
  28,70,He is God. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. All praise belongs to Him in this life and the next. All authority is His. And to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned
