quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,˹At least˺ for ˹the favour of˺ making Quraysh habitually secure—
  106,2,secure in their trading caravan ˹to Yemen˺ in the winter and ˹Syria˺ in the summer—
  106,3,let them worship the Lord of this ˹Sacred˺ House
  106,4,Who has fed them against hunger and made them secure against fear
  107,1,Have you seen the one who denies the ˹final˺ Judgment
  107,2,That is the one who repulses the orphan
  107,3,and does not encourage the feeding of the poor
  107,4,So woe to those ˹hypocrites˺ who pray
  107,5,yet are unmindful of their prayers
  107,6,those who ˹only˺ show off
  107,7,and refuse to give ˹even the simplest˺ aid
  108,1,"Indeed, We have granted you ˹O Prophet˺ abundant goodness"
  108,2,So pray and sacrifice to your Lord ˹alone˺
  108,3,Only the one who hates you is truly cut off ˹from any goodness˺
