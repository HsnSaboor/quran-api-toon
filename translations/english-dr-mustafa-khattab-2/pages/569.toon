quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,˹although˺ they will be made to see each other. The wicked will wish to ransom themselves from the punishment of that Day by their children
  70,12,"their spouses, their siblings"
  70,13,their clan that sheltered them
  70,14,"and everyone on earth altogether, just to save themselves"
  70,15,But no! There will certainly be a raging Flame
  70,16,ripping off scalps
  70,17,It will summon whoever turned their backs ˹on God˺ and turned away ˹from the truth˺
  70,18,and gathered and hoarded ˹wealth˺
  70,19,"Indeed, humankind was created impatient"
  70,20,distressed when touched with evil
  70,21,and withholding when touched with good—

  70,32,˹The faithful are˺ also those who are true to their trusts and covenants
  70,33,and who are honest in their testimony
  70,34,and who are ˹properly˺ observant of their prayers
  70,35,"These will be in Gardens, held in honour"
  70,36,So what is the matter with the disbelievers that they rush ˹head-long˺ towards you ˹O Prophet˺
  70,37,"from the right and the left, in groups ˹to mock you˺"
  70,38,Does every one of them expect to be admitted into a Garden of Bliss
