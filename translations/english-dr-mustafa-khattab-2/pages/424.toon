quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  33,44,"Their greeting on the Day they meet Him will be, “Peace!” And He has prepared for them an honourable reward"
  33,45,"O Prophet! We have sent you as a witness, and a deliverer of good news, and a warner"
  33,46,"and a caller to ˹the Way of˺ God by His command, and a beacon of light"
  33,47,Give good news to the believers that they will have a great bounty from God
  33,48,"Do not yield to the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Overlook their annoyances, and put your trust in God. For God is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs"
  33,49,"O believers! If you marry believing women and then divorce them before you touch them, they will have no waiting period for you to count, so give them a ˹suitable˺ compensation, and let them go graciously"
  33,50,"O Prophet! We have made lawful for you your wives to whom you have paid their ˹full˺ dowries as well as those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession, whom God has granted you. And ˹you are allowed to marry˺ the daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts, who have emigrated like you. Also ˹allowed for marriage is˺ a believing woman who offers herself to the Prophet ˹without dowry˺ if he is interested in marrying her—˹this is˺ exclusively for you, not for the rest of the believers. We know well what ˹rulings˺ We have ordained for the believers in relation to their wives and those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession. As such, there would be no blame on you. And God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
