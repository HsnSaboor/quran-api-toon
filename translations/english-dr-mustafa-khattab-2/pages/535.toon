quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,They will be waited on by eternal youths
  56,18,"with cups, pitchers, and a drink ˹of pure wine˺ from a flowing stream"
  56,19,that will cause them neither headache nor intoxication
  56,20,˹They will also be served˺ any fruit they choose
  56,21,and meat from any bird they desire
  56,22,And ˹they will have˺ maidens with gorgeous eyes
  56,23,like pristine pearls
  56,24,˹all˺ as a reward for what they used to do
  56,25,There they will never hear any idle or sinful talk—
  56,26,only good and virtuous speech
  56,27,And the people of the right—how ˹blessed˺ will they be
  56,28,˹They will be˺ amid thornless lote trees
  56,29,clusters of bananas
  56,30,extended shade
  56,31,flowing water
  56,32,abundant fruit—
  56,33,never out of season nor forbidden—
  56,34,and elevated furnishings
  56,35,"Indeed, We will have perfectly created their mates"
  56,36,making them virgins
  56,37,loving and of equal age
  56,38,for the people of the right
  56,39,˹who will be˺ a multitude from earlier generations
  56,40,and a multitude from later generations
  56,41,And the people of the left—how ˹miserable˺ will they be
  56,42,˹They will be˺ in scorching heat and boiling water
  56,43,in the shade of black smoke
  56,44,neither cool nor refreshing
  56,45,"Indeed, before this ˹torment˺ they were spoiled by luxury"
  56,46,and persisted in the worst of sin
  56,47,"They used to ask ˹mockingly˺, “When we are dead and reduced to dust and bones, will we really be resurrected"
  56,48,And our forefathers as well?”
  56,49,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Most certainly, earlier and later generations"
  56,50,will surely be gathered ˹together˺ for the appointed Day
