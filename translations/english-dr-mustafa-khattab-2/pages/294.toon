quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  18,5,"They have no knowledge of this, nor did their forefathers. What a terrible claim that comes out of their mouths! They say nothing but lies"
  18,6,"Now, perhaps you ˹O Prophet˺ will grieve yourself to death over their denial, if they ˹continue to˺ disbelieve in this message"
  18,7,"We have indeed made whatever is on earth as an adornment for it, in order to test which of them is best in deeds"
  18,8,And We will certainly reduce whatever is on it to barren ground
  18,9,Have you ˹O Prophet˺ thought that the people of the cave and the plaque were ˹the only˺ wonders of Our signs
  18,10,"˹Remember˺ when those youths took refuge in the cave, and said, “Our Lord! Grant us mercy from Yourself and guide us rightly through our ordeal.”"
  18,11,So We caused them to fall into a dead sleep in the cave for many years
  18,12,then We raised them so We may show which of the two groups would make a better estimation of the length of their stay
  18,13,"We relate to you ˹O Prophet˺ their story in truth. They were youths who truly believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance"
  18,14,"And We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and declared, “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will never call upon any god besides Him, or we would truly be uttering an outrageous lie.”"
  18,15,"˹Then they said to one another,˺ “These people of ours have taken gods besides Him. Why do they not produce a clear proof of them? Who then does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against God"
