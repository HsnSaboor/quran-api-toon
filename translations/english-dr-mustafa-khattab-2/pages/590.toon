quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  85,1,By the sky full of constellations
  85,2,and the promised Day ˹of Judgment˺
  85,3,and the witness and what is witnessed
  85,4,Condemned are the makers of the ditch—
  85,5,"the fire ˹pit˺, filled with fuel—"
  85,6,when they sat around it
  85,7,watching what they had ˹ordered to be˺ done to the believers
  85,8,"who they resented for no reason other than belief in God—the Almighty, the Praiseworthy—"
  85,9,˹the One˺ to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and earth. And God is a Witness over all things
  85,10,Those who persecute the believing men and women and then do not repent will certainly suffer the punishment of Hell and the torment of burning
  85,11,Surely those who believe and do good will have Gardens under which rivers flow. That is the greatest triumph
  85,12,"Indeed, the ˹crushing˺ grip of your Lord is severe"
  85,13,˹For˺ He is certainly the One Who originates and resurrects ˹all˺
  85,14,"And He is the All-Forgiving, All-Loving—"
  85,15,"Lord of the Throne, the All-Glorious"
  85,16,Doer of whatever He wills
  85,17,Has the story of the ˹destroyed˺ forces reached you ˹O Prophet˺—
  85,18,˹the forces of˺ Pharaoh and Thamûd
  85,19,Yet the disbelievers ˹still˺ persist in denial
  85,20,But God encompasses them from all sides
  85,21,"In fact, this is a glorious Quran"
  85,22,˹recorded˺ in a Preserved Tablet
