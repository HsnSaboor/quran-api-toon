quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,158,Whether you die or are martyred—all of you will be gathered before God
  3,159,"It is out of God’s mercy that you ˹O Prophet˺ have been lenient with them. Had you been cruel or hard-hearted, they would have certainly abandoned you. So pardon them, ask God’s forgiveness for them, and consult with them in ˹conducting˺ matters. Once you make a decision, put your trust in God. Surely God loves those who trust in Him"
  3,160,"If God helps you, none can defeat you. But if He denies you help, then who else can help you? So in God let the believers put their trust"
  3,161,"It is not appropriate for a prophet to illegally withhold spoils of war. And whoever does so, it will be held against them on the Day of Judgment. Then every soul will be paid in full for what it has done, and none will be wronged"
  3,162,Are those who seek God’s pleasure like those who deserve God’s wrath? Hell is their home. What an evil destination
  3,163,They ˹each˺ have varying degrees in the sight of God. And God is All-Seeing of what they do
  3,164,"Indeed, God has done the believers a ˹great˺ favour by raising a messenger from among them—reciting to them His revelations, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and wisdom. For indeed they had previously been clearly astray"
  3,165,"Why is it when you suffered casualties ˹at Uḥud˺—although you had made your enemy suffer twice as much ˹at Badr˺—you protested, “How could this be?”? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “It is because of your disobedience.” Surely God is Most Capable of everything"
