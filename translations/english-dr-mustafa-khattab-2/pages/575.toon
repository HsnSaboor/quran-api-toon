quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Surely your Lord knows that you ˹O Prophet˺ stand ˹in prayer˺ for nearly two-thirds of the night, or ˹sometimes˺ half of it, or a third, as do some of those with you. God ˹alone˺ keeps a ˹precise˺ measure of the day and night. He knows that you ˹believers˺ are unable to endure this, and has turned to you in mercy. So recite ˹in prayer˺ whatever you can from the Quran. He knows that some of you will be sick, some will be travelling throughout the land seeking God’s bounty, and some fighting in the cause of God. So recite whatever you can from it. And ˹continue to˺ perform ˹regular˺ prayers, pay alms-tax, and lend to God a good loan. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with God far better and more rewarding. And seek God’s forgiveness. Surely God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  74,1,O you covered up ˹in your clothes˺
  74,2,Arise and warn ˹all˺
  74,3,Revere your Lord ˹alone˺
  74,4,Purify your garments
  74,5,˹Continue to˺ shun idols
  74,6,Do not do a favour expecting more ˹in return˺
  74,7,And persevere for ˹the sake of˺ your Lord
  74,8,˹For˺ when the Trumpet will be sounded
  74,9,that will ˹truly˺ be a difficult Day—
  74,10,far from easy for the disbelievers
  74,11,And leave to me ˹O Prophet˺ the one I created all by Myself
  74,12,and granted him abundant wealth
  74,13,and children always by his side
  74,14,and made life very easy for him
  74,15,Yet he is hungry for more
  74,16,But no! ˹For˺ he has been truly stubborn with Our revelations
  74,17,I will make his fate unbearable
