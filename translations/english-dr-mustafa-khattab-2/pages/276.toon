quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,80,"And God has made your homes a place to rest, and has given you tents from the hide of animals, light to handle when you travel and when you camp. And out of their wool, fur, and hair He has given you furnishings and goods for a while"
  16,81,"And God has provided you shade out of what He created, and has given you shelter in the mountains. He has also provided you with clothes protecting you from the heat ˹and cold˺, and armour shielding you in battle. This is how He perfects His favour upon you, so perhaps you will ˹fully˺ submit ˹to Him˺"
  16,82,"But if they turn away, then your duty ˹O Prophet˺ is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly"
  16,83,"They are aware of God’s favours, but still deny them. And most of them are ˹truly˺ ungrateful"
  16,84,"˹Consider, O Prophet,˺ the Day We will call ˹a prophet as˺ a witness from every faith-community. Then the disbelievers will neither be allowed to plead nor appease ˹their Lord˺"
  16,85,"And when the wrongdoers face the punishment, it will not be lightened for them, nor will they be delayed ˹from it˺"
  16,86,"And when the polytheists see their associate-gods, they will say, “Our Lord! These are our associate-gods that we used to invoke besides You.” Their gods will throw a rebuttal at them, ˹saying,˺ “You are definitely liars.”"
  16,87,"They will offer ˹full˺ submission to God on that Day, and whatever ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them"
