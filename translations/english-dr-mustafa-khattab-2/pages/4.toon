quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"Their example is that of someone who kindles a fire, but when it lights up all around them, God takes away their light, leaving them in complete darkness—unable to see"
  2,18,"They are ˹wilfully˺ deaf, dumb, and blind, so they will never return ˹to the Right Path˺"
  2,19,"Or ˹those caught in˺ a rainstorm from the sky with darkness, thunder, and lightning. They press their fingers into their ears at the sound of every thunder-clap for fear of death. And God encompasses the disbelievers ˹by His might˺"
  2,20,"It is as if the lightning were about to snatch away their sight. Whenever lightning strikes, they walk in its light, but when darkness covers them, they stand still. Had God willed, He could have taken away their hearing and sight. Surely God is Most Capable of everything"
  2,21,"O humanity! Worship your Lord, Who created you and those before you, so that you may become mindful ˹of Him˺"
  2,22,"˹He is the One˺ Who has made the earth a place of settlement for you and the sky a canopy; and sends down rain from the sky, causing fruits to grow as a provision for you. So do not knowingly set up equals to God ˹in worship˺"
  2,23,"And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a sûrah like it and call your helpers other than God, if what you say is true"
  2,24,"But if you are unable to do so—and you will never be able to do so—then fear the Fire fuelled with people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers"
