quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  27,23,"Indeed, I found a woman ruling over them, who has been given everything ˹she needs˺, and who has a magnificent throne"
  27,24,I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of God. For Satan has made their deeds appealing to them—hindering them from the ˹Right˺ Way and leaving them unguided—
  27,25,"so they do not prostrate to God, Who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you ˹all˺ conceal and what you reveal"
  27,26,"˹He is˺ God! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.”"
  27,27,"Solomon said, “We will see whether you are telling the truth or lying"
  27,28,"Go with this letter of mine and deliver it to them, then stand aside and see how they will respond.”"
  27,29,"The Queen ˹later˺ announced, “O chiefs! Indeed, a noble letter has been delivered to me"
  27,30,"It is from Solomon, and it reads: ‘In the Name of God—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful"
  27,31,"Do not be arrogant with me, but come to me, fully submitting ˹to God˺.’”"
  27,32,"She said, “O chiefs! Advise me in this matter of mine, for I would never make any decision without you.”"
  27,33,"They responded, “We are a people of strength and great ˹military˺ might, but the decision is yours, so decide what you will command.”"
  27,34,"She reasoned, “Indeed, when kings invade a land, they ruin it and debase its nobles. They really do so"
  27,35,"But I will certainly send him a gift, and see what ˹response˺ my envoys will return with.”"
