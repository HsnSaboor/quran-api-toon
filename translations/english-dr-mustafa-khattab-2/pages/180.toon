quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,26,"Remember when you had been vastly outnumbered and oppressed in the land, constantly in fear of attacks by your enemy, then He sheltered you, strengthened you with His help, and provided you with good things so perhaps you would be thankful"
  8,27,"O believers! Do not betray God and the Messenger, nor betray your trusts knowingly"
  8,28,And know that your wealth and your children are only a test and that with God is a great reward
  8,29,"O believers! If you are mindful of God, He will grant you a standard ˹to distinguish between right and wrong˺, absolve you of your sins, and forgive you. And God is the Lord of infinite bounty"
  8,30,"And ˹remember, O Prophet,˺ when the disbelievers conspired to capture, kill, or exile you. They planned, but God also planned. And God is the best of planners"
  8,31,"Whenever Our revelations are recited to them, they challenge ˹you˺, “We have already heard ˹the recitation˺. If we wanted, we could have easily produced something similar. This ˹Quran˺ is nothing but ancient fables!”"
  8,32,"And ˹remember˺ when they prayed, “O God! If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones upon us from the sky or overcome us with a painful punishment.”"
  8,33,But God would never punish them while you ˹O Prophet˺ were in their midst. Nor would He ever punish them if they prayed for forgiveness
