quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the fig and the olive ˹of Jerusalem˺
  95,2,and Mount Sinai
  95,3,and this secure city ˹of Mecca˺
  95,4,"Indeed, We created humans in the best form"
  95,5,But We will reduce them to the lowest of the low ˹in Hell˺
  95,6,except those who believe and do good—they will have a never-ending reward
  95,7,"Now, what makes you deny the ˹final˺ Judgment"
  95,8,Is God not the most just of all judges
  96,1,"Read, ˹O Prophet,˺ in the Name of your Lord Who created—"
  96,2,created humans from a clinging clot
  96,3,Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous
  96,4,Who taught by the pen—
  96,5,taught humanity what they knew not
  96,6,"Most certainly, one exceeds all bounds"
  96,7,once they think they are self-sufficient
  96,8,˹But˺ surely to your Lord is the return ˹of all˺
  96,9,Have you seen the man who prevents
  96,10,a servant ˹of Ours˺ from praying
  96,11,What if this ˹servant˺ is ˹rightly˺ guided
  96,12,or encourages righteousness
  96,13,What if that ˹man˺ persists in denial and turns away
  96,14,Does he not know that God sees ˹all˺
  96,15,"But no! If he does not desist, We will certainly drag him by the forelock—"
  96,16,"a lying, sinful forelock"
  96,17,So let him call his associates
  96,18,We will call the wardens of Hell
  96,19,"Again, no! Never obey him ˹O Prophet˺! Rather, ˹continue to˺ prostrate and draw near ˹to God˺"
