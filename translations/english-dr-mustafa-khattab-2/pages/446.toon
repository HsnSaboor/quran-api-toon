quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,1,By those ˹angels˺ lined up in ranks
  37,2,and those who diligently drive ˹the clouds˺
  37,3,and those who recite the Reminder
  37,4,Surely your God is One
  37,5,"˹He is˺ the Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything in between, and the Lord of all points of sunrise"
  37,6,"Indeed, We have adorned the lowest heaven with the stars for decoration"
  37,7,and ˹for˺ protection from every rebellious devil
  37,8,They cannot listen to the highest assembly ˹of angels˺ for they are pelted from every side
  37,9,˹fiercely˺ driven away. And they will suffer an everlasting torment
  37,10,But whoever manages to stealthily eavesdrop is ˹instantly˺ pursued by a piercing flare
  37,11,"So ask them ˹O Prophet˺, which is harder to create: them or other marvels of Our creation? Indeed, We created them from a sticky clay"
  37,12,"In fact, you are astonished ˹by their denial˺, while they ridicule ˹you˺"
  37,13,"When they are reminded, they are never mindful"
  37,14,"And whenever they see a sign, they make fun of it"
  37,15,"saying, “This is nothing but pure magic"
  37,16,"When we are dead and reduced to dust and bones, will we really be resurrected"
  37,17,And our forefathers as well?”
  37,18,"Say, “Yes! And you will be fully humbled.”"
  37,19,"It will only take one Blast, then at once they will see ˹it all˺"
  37,20,"They will cry, “Oh, woe to us! This is the Day of Judgment!”"
  37,21,"˹They will be told,˺ “This is the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision which you used to deny.”"
  37,22,"˹God will say to the angels,˺ “Gather ˹all˺ the wrongdoers along with their peers, and whatever they used to worship"
  37,23,"instead of God, then lead them ˹all˺ to the path of Hell"
  37,24,"And detain them, for they must be questioned.”"
