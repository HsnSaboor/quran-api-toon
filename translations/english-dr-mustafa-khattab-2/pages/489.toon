quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  42,52,"And so We have sent to you ˹O Prophet˺ a revelation by Our command. You did not know of ˹this˺ Book and faith ˹before˺. But We have made it a light, by which We guide whoever We will of Our servants. And you are truly leading ˹all˺ to the Straight Path—"
  42,53,"the Path of God, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Surely to God all matters will return ˹for judgment˺"
  43,1,Ḥâ-Mĩm
  43,2,By the clear Book
  43,3,"Certainly, We have made it a Quran in Arabic so perhaps you will understand"
  43,4,"And indeed, it is—in the Master Record with Us—highly esteemed, rich in wisdom"
  43,5,Should We then turn the ˹Quranic˺ Reminder away from you ˹simply˺ because you have been a transgressing people
  43,6,˹Imagine˺ how many prophets We sent to those ˹destroyed˺ before
  43,7,But no prophet ever came to them without being mocked
  43,8,So We destroyed those who were far mightier than these ˹Meccans˺. The examples of ˹their˺ predecessors have ˹already˺ been related
  43,9,"If you ask them ˹O Prophet˺ who created the heavens and the earth, they will certainly say, “The Almighty, All-Knowing did.”"
  43,10,"˹He is the One˺ Who has laid out the earth for you, and set in it pathways for you so that you may find your way"
