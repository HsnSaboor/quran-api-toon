quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,Bless me with honourable mention among later generations
  26,85,Make me one of those awarded the Garden of Bliss
  26,86,"Forgive my father, for he is certainly one of the misguided"
  26,87,And do not disgrace me on the Day all will be resurrected—
  26,88,the Day when neither wealth nor children will be of any benefit
  26,89,Only those who come before God with a pure heart ˹will be saved˺.”
  26,90,˹On that Day˺ Paradise will be brought near to the God-fearing
  26,91,and the Hellfire will be displayed to the deviant
  26,92,"And it will be said to them, “Where are those you used to worship"
  26,93,besides God? Can they help you or even help themselves?”
  26,94,"Then the idols will be hurled headlong into Hell, along with the deviant"
  26,95,"and the soldiers of Iblîs, all together"
  26,96,There the deviant will cry while disputing with their idols
  26,97,“By God! We were clearly mistaken
  26,98,when we made you equal to the Lord of all worlds
  26,99,And none led us astray other than the wicked
  26,100,Now we have none to intercede for us
  26,101,nor a close friend
  26,102,"If only we could have a second chance, then we would be believers.”"
  26,103,Surely in this is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe
  26,104,"And your Lord is certainly the Almighty, Most Merciful"
  26,105,The people of Noah rejected the messengers
  26,106,"when their brother Noah said to them, “Will you not fear ˹God˺"
  26,107,I am truly a trustworthy messenger to you
  26,108,"So fear God, and obey me"
  26,109,I do not ask you for any reward for this ˹message˺. My reward is only from the Lord of all worlds
  26,110,"So fear God, and obey me.”"
  26,111,"They argued, “How can we believe in you, when you are followed ˹only˺ by the lowest of the low?”"
