quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,123,O believers! Fight the disbelievers around you and let them find firmness in you. And know that God is with those mindful ˹of Him˺
  9,124,"Whenever a sûrah is revealed, some of them ask ˹mockingly˺, “Which of you has this increased in faith?” As for the believers, it has increased them in faith and they rejoice"
  9,125,"But as for those with sickness in their hearts, it has increased them only in wickedness upon their wickedness, and they die as disbelievers"
  9,126,Do they not see that they are tried once or twice every year? Yet they neither repent nor do they learn a lesson
  9,127,"Whenever a sûrah is revealed, they look at one another, ˹saying,˺ “Is anyone watching you?” Then they slip away. ˹It is˺ God ˹Who˺ has turned their hearts away because they are a people who do not comprehend"
  9,128,"There certainly has come to you a messenger from among yourselves. He is concerned by your suffering, anxious for your well-being, and gracious and merciful to the believers"
  9,129,"But if they turn away, then say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “God is sufficient for me. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. In Him I put my trust. And He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.”"
