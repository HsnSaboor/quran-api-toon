quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  17,50,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹Yes, even if˺ you become stones, or iron"
  17,51,"or whatever you think is harder to bring to life!” Then they will ask ˹you˺, “Who will bring us back ˹to life˺?” Say, “The One Who created you the first time.” They will then shake their heads at you and ask, “When will that be?” Say, “Perhaps it is soon!”"
  17,52,"On the Day He will call you, you will ˹instantly˺ respond by praising Him, thinking you had remained ˹in the world˺ only for a little while"
  17,53,Tell My ˹believing˺ servants to say only what is best. Satan certainly seeks to sow discord among them. Satan is indeed a sworn enemy to humankind
  17,54,"Your Lord knows you best. He may have mercy on you if He wills, or punish you if He wills. We have not sent you ˹O Prophet˺ as a keeper over them"
  17,55,"Your Lord knows best all those in the heavens and the earth. And We have surely favoured some prophets above others, and to David We gave the Psalms"
  17,56,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Invoke those you claim ˹to be divine˺ besides Him—they do not have the power to undo harm from you or transfer it ˹to someone else˺.”"
  17,57,"˹Even˺ the closest ˹to God˺ of those invoked would be seeking a way to their Lord, hoping for His mercy, and fearing His punishment. Indeed, your Lord’s torment is fearsome"
  17,58,There is not a ˹wicked˺ society that We will not destroy or punish with a severe torment before the Day of Judgment. That is written in the Record
