  6,53,"In this way We have tested some by means of others, so those ˹disbelievers˺ may say, “Has God favoured these ˹poor believers˺ out of all of us?” Does God not best recognize the grateful"
  6,54,"When the believers in Our revelations come to you, say, “Peace be upon you! Your Lord has taken upon Himself to be Merciful. Whoever among you commits evil ignorantly ˹or recklessly˺ then repents afterwards and mends their ways, then God is truly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”"
  6,55,"This is how We make Our signs clear, so the way of the wicked may become distinct"
  6,56,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I have been forbidden to worship those you invoke besides God.” Say, “I will not follow your desires, for I then would certainly be astray and not one of those ˹rightly˺ guided.”"
  6,57,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Indeed, I stand on a clear proof from my Lord—yet you have denied it. That ˹torment˺ you seek to hasten is not within my power. It is only God Who decides ˹its time˺. He declares the truth. And He is the Best of Judges.”"
  6,58,"Say ˹also˺, “If what you seek to hasten were within my power, the matter between us would have already been settled. But God knows the wrongdoers best.”"
  6,59,"With Him are the keys of the unseen—no one knows them except Him. And He knows what is in the land and sea. Not even a leaf falls without His knowledge, nor a grain in the darkness of the earth or anything—green or dry—but is ˹written˺ in a perfect Record"
