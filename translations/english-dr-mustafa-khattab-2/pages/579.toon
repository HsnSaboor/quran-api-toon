quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  76,6,"˹from˺ a spring where God’s servants will drink, flowing at their will"
  76,7,They ˹are those who˺ fulfil ˹their˺ vows and fear a Day of sweeping horror
  76,8,"and give food—despite their desire for it—to the poor, the orphan, and the captive"
  76,9,"˹saying to themselves,˺ “We feed you only for the sake of God, seeking neither reward nor thanks from you"
  76,10,We fear from our Lord a horribly distressful Day.”
  76,11,"So God will deliver them from the horror of that Day, and grant them radiance and joy"
  76,12,and reward them for their perseverance with a Garden ˹in Paradise˺ and ˹garments of˺ silk
  76,13,"There they will be reclining on ˹canopied˺ couches, never seeing scorching heat or bitter cold"
  76,14,"The Garden’s shade will be right above them, and its fruit will be made very easy to reach"
  76,15,They will be waited on with silver vessels and cups of crystal—
  76,16,"crystalline silver, filled precisely as desired"
  76,17,And they will be given a drink ˹of pure wine˺ flavoured with ginger
  76,18,"from a spring there, called Salsabîl"
  76,19,"They will be waited on by eternal youths. If you saw them, you would think they were scattered pearls"
  76,20,"And if you looked around, you would see ˹indescribable˺ bliss and a vast kingdom"
  76,21,"The virtuous will be ˹dressed˺ in garments of fine green silk and rich brocade, and adorned with bracelets of silver, and their Lord will give them a purifying drink"
  76,22,"˹And they will be told,˺ “All this is surely a reward for you. Your striving has been appreciated.”"
  76,23,"Indeed, it is We Who have revealed the Quran to you ˹O Prophet˺ in stages"
  76,24,"So be patient with your Lord’s decree, and do not yield to any evildoer or ˹staunch˺ disbeliever from among them"
  76,25,˹Always˺ remember the Name of your Lord morning and evening
