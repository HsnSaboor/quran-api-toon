  20,100,Whoever turns away from it will surely bear the burden ˹of sin˺ on the Day of Judgment
  20,101,suffering its consequences forever. What an evil burden they will carry on Judgment Day
  20,102,"˹Beware of˺ the Day the Trumpet will be blown, and We will gather the wicked on that Day blue-faced ˹from horror and thirst˺"
  20,103,"They will whisper among themselves, “You stayed no more than ten days ˹on the earth˺.”"
  20,104,"We know best what they will say—the most reasonable of them will say, “You stayed no more than a day.”"
  20,105,"And ˹if˺ they ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about the mountains, ˹then˺ say, “My Lord will wipe them out completely"

  20,111,"And all faces will be humbled before the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining. And those burdened with wrongdoing will be in loss"
  20,112,But whoever does good and is a believer will have no fear of being wronged or denied ˹their reward˺
  20,113,"And so We have sent it down as an Arabic Quran and varied the warnings in it, so perhaps they will shun evil or it may cause them to be mindful"
