quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and its brightness
  91,2,and the moon as it follows it
  91,3,and the day as it unveils it
  91,4,and the night as it conceals it
  91,5,And by heaven and ˹the One˺ Who built it
  91,6,and the earth and ˹the One˺ Who spread it
  91,7,And by the soul and ˹the One˺ Who fashioned it
  91,8,then with ˹the knowledge of˺ right and wrong inspired it
  91,9,Successful indeed is the one who purifies their soul
  91,10,and doomed is the one who corrupts it
  91,11,Thamûd rejected ˹the truth˺ out of arrogance
  91,12,when the most wicked of them was roused ˹to kill the she-camel˺
  91,13,"But the messenger of God warned them, “˹Do not disturb˺ God’s camel and her ˹turn to˺ drink!”"
  91,14,"Still they defied him and slaughtered her. So their Lord crushed them for their crime, levelling all to the ground"
  91,15,He has no fear of consequences
  92,1,By the night when it covers
  92,2,and the day when it shines
  92,3,And by ˹the One˺ Who created male and female
  92,4,Surely the ends you strive for are diverse
  92,5,"As for the one who is charitable, mindful ˹of God˺"
  92,6,and ˹firmly˺ believes in the finest reward
  92,7,We will facilitate for them the Way of Ease
  92,8,"And as for the one who is stingy, indifferent ˹to God˺"
  92,9,and ˹staunchly˺ denies the finest reward
  92,10,We will facilitate for them the path of hardship
  92,11,And their wealth will be of no benefit to them when they tumble ˹into Hell˺
  92,12,It is certainly upon Us ˹alone˺ to show ˹the way to˺ guidance
  92,13,And surely to Us ˹alone˺ belong this life and the next
  92,14,And so I have warned you of a raging Fire
