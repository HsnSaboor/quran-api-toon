quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,65,Do you not see that God has subjected to you whatever is in the earth as well as the ships ˹that˺ sail through the sea by His command? He keeps the sky from falling down on the earth except by His permission. Surely God is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to humanity
  22,66,"And He is the One Who gave you life, then will cause you to die, and then will bring you back to life. ˹But˺ surely humankind is ever ungrateful"
  22,67,"For every community We appointed a code of life to follow. So do not let them dispute with you ˹O Prophet˺ in this matter. And invite ˹all˺ to your Lord, for you are truly on the Right Guidance"
  22,68,"But if they argue with you, then say, “God knows best what you do.”"
  22,69,God will judge between you ˹all˺ on Judgment Day regarding your differences
  22,70,Do you not know that God ˹fully˺ knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth? Surely it is all ˹written˺ in a Record. That is certainly easy for God
  22,71,"Yet they worship besides God that for which He has sent down no authority, and of which they have no knowledge. The wrongdoers will have no helper"
  22,72,"Whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, you ˹O Prophet˺ recognize rage on the faces of the disbelievers, as if they are going to snap at those who recite Our revelations to them. Say, “Shall I inform you of something far more enraging than that? ˹It is˺ the Fire with which God has threatened those who disbelieve. What an evil destination!”"
