quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  56,51,"Then you, O misguided deniers"
  56,52,will certainly eat from ˹the fruit of˺ the trees of Zaqqûm
  56,53,filling up ˹your˺ bellies with it
  56,54,Then on top of that you will drink boiling water—

  56,71,Have you considered the fire you kindle
  56,72,"Is it you who produce its trees, or is it We Who do so"
  56,73,We have made it ˹as˺ a reminder ˹of the Hellfire˺ and a provision for the travellers
  56,74,"So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Greatest"
