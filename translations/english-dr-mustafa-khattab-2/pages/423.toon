quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,"It is not for a believing man or woman—when God and His Messenger decree a matter—to have any other choice in that matter. Indeed, whoever disobeys God and His Messenger has clearly gone ˹far˺ astray"
  33,37,"And ˹remember, O Prophet,˺ when you said to the one for whom God has done a favour and you ˹too˺ have done a favour, “Keep your wife and fear God,” while concealing within yourself what God was going to reveal. And ˹so˺ you were considering the people, whereas God was more worthy of your consideration. So when Zaid totally lost interest in ˹keeping˺ his wife, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there would be no blame on the believers for marrying the ex-wives of their adopted sons after their divorce. And God’s command is totally binding"
  33,38,There is no blame on the Prophet for doing what God has ordained for him. That has been the way of God with those ˹prophets˺ who had gone before. And God’s command has been firmly decreed
  33,39,"˹That is His way with˺ those ˹prophets˺ who deliver the messages of God, and consider Him, and none but God. And sufficient is God as a ˹vigilant˺ Reckoner"
  33,40,"Muḥammad is not the father of any of your men, but is the Messenger of God and the seal of the prophets. And God has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things"
  33,41,O believers! Always remember God often
  33,42,and glorify Him morning and evening
  33,43,He is the One Who showers His blessings upon you—and His angels pray for you—so that He may bring you out of darkness and into light. For He is ever Merciful to the believers
