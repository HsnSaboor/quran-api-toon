quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,1,All praise is for God Who created the heavens and the earth and made darkness and light. Yet the disbelievers set up equals to their Lord ˹in worship˺
  6,2,"He is the One Who created you from clay, then appointed a term ˹for your death˺ and another known only to Him ˹for your resurrection˺—yet you continue to doubt"
  6,3,"He is the Only True God in the heavens and the earth. He knows whatever you conceal and whatever you reveal, and knows whatever you do"
  6,4,"Whenever a sign comes to them from their Lord, they turn away from it"
  6,5,"They have indeed rejected the truth when it came to them, so they will soon face the consequences of their ridicule"
  6,6,Have they not seen how many ˹disbelieving˺ peoples We destroyed before them? We had made them more established in the land than you. We sent down abundant rain for them and made rivers flow at their feet. Then We destroyed them for their sins and replaced them with other peoples
  6,7,"Had We sent down to you ˹O Prophet˺ a revelation in writing and they were to touch it with their own hands, the disbelievers would still have said, “This is nothing but pure magic!”"
  6,8,"They say, “Why has no ˹visible˺ angel come with him?” Had We sent down an angel, the matter would have certainly been settled ˹at once˺, and they would have never been given more time ˹to repent˺"
