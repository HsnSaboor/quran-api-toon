quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,95,"Indeed, God is the One Who causes seeds and fruit stones to sprout. He brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. That is God! How can you then be deluded ˹from the truth˺"
  6,96,"He causes the dawn to break, and has made the night for rest and ˹made˺ the sun and the moon ˹to travel˺ with precision. That is the design of the Almighty, All-Knowing"
  6,97,And He is the One Who has made the stars as your guide through the darkness of land and sea. We have already made the signs clear for people who know
  6,98,"And He is the One Who originated you all from a single soul, then assigned you a place to live and another to ˹be laid to˺ rest. We have already made the signs clear for people who comprehend"
  6,99,"And He is the One Who sends down rain from the sky—causing all kinds of plants to grow—producing green stalks from which We bring forth clustered grain. And from palm trees come clusters of dates hanging within reach. ˹There are˺ also gardens of grapevines, olives, and pomegranates, similar ˹in shape˺ but dissimilar ˹in taste˺. Look at their fruit as it yields and ripens! Indeed, in these are signs for people who believe"
  6,100,"Yet they associate the jinn with God ˹in worship˺, even though He created them, and they falsely attribute to Him sons and daughters out of ignorance. Glorified and Exalted is He above what they claim"
  6,101,˹He is˺ the Originator of the heavens and earth. How could He have children when He has no mate? He created all things and has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of everything
