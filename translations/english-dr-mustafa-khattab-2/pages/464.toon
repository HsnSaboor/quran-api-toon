quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  39,48,"And the evil ˹consequences˺ of their deeds will unfold before them, and they will be overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule"
  39,49,"When one is touched with hardship, they cry out to Us ˹alone˺. Then when We shower Our blessings upon them, they say, “I have been granted all this only because of ˹my˺ knowledge.” Not at all! It is ˹no more than˺ a test. But most of them do not know"
  39,50,"The same had already been said by those ˹destroyed˺ before them, but their ˹worldly˺ gains were of no benefit to them"
  39,51,So the evil ˹consequences˺ of their deeds overtook them. And the wrongdoers among these ˹pagans˺ will be overtaken by the evil ˹consequences˺ of their deeds. And they will have no escape
  39,52,Do they not know that God gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills? Surely in this are signs for people who believe
  39,53,"Say, ˹O Prophet, that God says,˺ “O My servants who have exceeded the limits against their souls! Do not lose hope in God’s mercy, for God certainly forgives all sins. He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  39,54,"Turn to your Lord ˹in repentance˺, and ˹fully˺ submit to Him before the punishment reaches you, ˹for˺ then you will not be helped"
  39,55,"Follow ˹the Quran,˺ the best of what has been revealed to you from your Lord, before the punishment takes you by surprise while you are unaware"
  39,56,"so that no ˹sinful˺ soul will say ˹on Judgment Day˺, ‘Woe to me for neglecting ˹my duties towards˺ God, while ridiculing ˹the truth˺.’"
