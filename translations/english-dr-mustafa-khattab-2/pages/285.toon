quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,28,But if you must turn them down ˹because you lack the means to give˺—while hoping to receive your Lord’s bounty—then ˹at least˺ give them a kind word
  17,29,"Do not be so tight-fisted, for you will be blameworthy; nor so open-handed, for you will end up in poverty"
  17,30,"Surely your Lord gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills. He is certainly All-Aware, All-Seeing of His servants"
  17,31,Do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Surely killing them is a heinous sin
  17,32,Do not go near adultery. It is truly a shameful deed and an evil way
  17,33,"Do not take a ˹human˺ life—made sacred by God—except with ˹legal˺ right. If anyone is killed unjustly, We have given their heirs the authority, but do not let them exceed limits in retaliation, for they are already supported ˹by law˺"
  17,34,"Do not come near the wealth of the orphan—unless intending to enhance it—until they attain maturity. Honour ˹your˺ pledges, for you will surely be accountable for them"
  17,35,"Give in full when you measure, and weigh with an even balance. That is fairest and best in the end"
  17,36,"Do not follow what you have no ˹sure˺ knowledge of. Indeed, all will be called to account for ˹their˺ hearing, sight, and intellect"
  17,37,And do not walk on the earth arrogantly. Surely you can neither crack the earth nor stretch to the height of the mountains
  17,38,The violation of any of these ˹commandments˺ is detestable to your Lord
