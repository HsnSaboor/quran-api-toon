quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,So this Day they will have no close friend here
  69,36,nor any food except ˹oozing˺ pus
  69,37,which none will eat except the evildoers.”
  69,38,"Now, I do swear by whatever you see"
  69,39,and whatever you cannot see
  69,40,"Indeed, this ˹Quran˺ is the recitation of a noble Messenger"
  69,41,"It is not the prose of a poet ˹as you claim˺, ˹yet˺ you hardly have any faith"
  69,42,"Nor is it the mumbling of a fortune-teller, ˹yet˺ you are hardly mindful"
  69,43,˹It is˺ a revelation from the Lord of all worlds
  69,44,Had the Messenger made up something in Our Name
  69,45,We would have certainly seized him by his right hand
  69,46,then severed his aorta
  69,47,and none of you could have shielded him ˹from Us˺
  69,48,"Indeed, this ˹Quran˺ is a reminder to those mindful ˹of God˺"
  69,49,And We certainly know that some of you will persist in denial
  69,50,and it will surely be a source of regret for the disbelievers
  69,51,"And indeed, this ˹Quran˺ is the absolute truth"
  69,52,"So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Greatest"
  70,1,A challenger has demanded a punishment bound to come
  70,2,for the disbelievers—to be averted by none—
  70,3,"from God, Lord of pathways of ˹heavenly˺ ascent"
  70,4,˹through which˺ the angels and the ˹holy˺ spirit will ascend to Him on a Day fifty thousand years in length
  70,5,"So endure ˹this denial, O Prophet,˺ with beautiful patience"
  70,6,They truly see this ˹Day˺ as impossible
  70,7,but We see it as inevitable
  70,8,On that Day the sky will be like molten brass
  70,9,and the mountains like ˹tufts of˺ wool
  70,10,And no close friend will ask ˹about˺ their friends
