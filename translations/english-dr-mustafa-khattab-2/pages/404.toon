  29,64,"This worldly life is no more than play and amusement. But the Hereafter is indeed the real life, if only they knew"
  29,65,"If they happen to be aboard a ship ˹caught in a storm˺, they cry out to God ˹alone˺ in sincere devotion. But as soon as He delivers them ˹safely˺ to shore, they associate ˹others with Him once again˺"
  29,66,"So let them be ungrateful for all We have given them, and ˹let them˺ enjoy themselves ˹for now˺! For they will soon know"
  29,67,"Have they not seen how We have made ˹Mecca˺ a safe haven, whereas people ˹all˺ around them are snatched away? How can they then believe in falsehood and deny God’s favours"

  29,69,"As for those who struggle in Our cause, We will surely guide them along Our Way. And God is certainly with the good-doers"

  30,5,"at the victory willed by God. He gives victory to whoever He wills. For He is the Almighty, Most Merciful"
