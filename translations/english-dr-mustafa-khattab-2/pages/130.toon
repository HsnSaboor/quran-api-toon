quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Who is the best witness?” Say, “God is! He is a Witness between me and you. And this Quran has been revealed to me so that, with it, I may warn you and whoever it reaches. Do you ˹pagans˺ testify that there are other gods besides God?” ˹Then˺ say, “I will never testify ˹to this˺!” ˹And˺ say, “There is only One God. And I totally reject whatever ˹idols˺ you associate with Him.”"
  6,20,Those to whom We gave the Scripture recognize him ˹to be a true prophet˺ as they recognize their own children. Those who have ruined themselves will never believe
  6,21,"Who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against God or deny His signs? Indeed, the wrongdoers will never succeed"
  6,22,"˹Consider˺ the Day We will gather them all together then ask those who associated others ˹with God in worship˺, “Where are those gods you used to claim?”"
  6,23,"Their only argument will be: “By God, our Lord! We were never polytheists.”"
  6,24,See how they will lie about themselves and how those ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them
  6,25,"There are some of them who ˹pretend to˺ listen to your recitation ˹of the Quran˺, but We have cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend it—and deafness in their ears. Even if they were to see every sign, they still would not believe in them. The disbelievers would ˹even˺ come to argue with you, saying, “This ˹Quran˺ is nothing but ancient fables!”"
  6,26,"They turn others away from the Prophet and distance themselves as well. They ruin none but themselves, yet they fail to perceive it"
  6,27,"If only you could see when they will be detained before the Fire! They will cry, “Oh! If only we could be sent back, we would never deny the signs of our Lord and we would ˹surely˺ be of the believers.”"
