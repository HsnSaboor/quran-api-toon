  9,2,"“You ˹polytheists˺ may travel freely through the land for four months, but know that you will have no escape from God, and that God will disgrace the disbelievers.”"
  9,3,"A declaration from God and His Messenger ˹is made˺ to all people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that God and His Messenger are free of the polytheists. So if you ˹pagans˺ repent, it will be better for you. But if you turn away, then know that you will have no escape from God. And give good news ˹O Prophet˺ to the disbelievers of a painful punishment"

  9,6,"And if anyone from the polytheists asks for your protection ˹O Prophet˺, grant it to them so they may hear the Word of God, then escort them to a place of safety, for they are a people who have no knowledge"
