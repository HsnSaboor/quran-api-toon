quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,6,˹This is˺ the promise of God. ˹And˺ God never fails in His promise. But most people do not know
  30,7,"They ˹only˺ know the worldly affairs of this life, but are ˹totally˺ oblivious to the Hereafter"
  30,8,Have they not reflected upon their own being? God only created the heavens and the earth and everything in between for a purpose and an appointed term. Yet most people are truly in denial of the meeting with their Lord
  30,9,"Have they not travelled throughout the land to see what was the end of those ˹destroyed˺ before them? They were far superior in might; they cultivated the land and developed it more than these ˹Meccans˺ ever have. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs. God would have never wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves"
  30,10,Then most evil was the end of the evildoers for denying and mocking the signs of God
  30,11,"It is God Who originates the creation, and will resurrect it. And then to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned"
  30,12,"On the Day the Hour will arrive, the wicked will be dumbstruck"
  30,13,"There will be no intercessors for them from among their associate-gods, and they will ˹totally˺ deny their associate-gods"
  30,14,"And on the Day the Hour will arrive, the people will then be split ˹into two groups˺"
  30,15,"As for those who believed and did good, they will be rejoicing in a Garden"
