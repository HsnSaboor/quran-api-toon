quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,265,"And the example of those who donate their wealth, seeking God’s pleasure and believing the reward is certain, is that of a garden on a fertile hill: when heavy rain falls, it yields up twice its normal produce. If no heavy rain falls, a drizzle is sufficient. And God is All-Seeing of what you do"
  2,266,"Would any of you wish to have a garden with palm trees, grapevines, and all kinds of fruits with rivers flowing underneath and as they grow very old with dependent children, a fiery whirlwind hits the garden, burning it all up? This is how God makes His revelations clear to you, so perhaps you will reflect"
  2,267,"O believers! Donate from the best of what you have earned and of what We have produced for you from the earth. Do not pick out worthless things for donation, which you yourselves would only accept with closed eyes. And know that God is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy"
  2,268,"The Devil threatens you with ˹the prospect of˺ poverty and bids you to the shameful deed ˹of stinginess˺, while God promises you forgiveness and ˹great˺ bounties from Him. And God is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing"
  2,269,God grants wisdom to whoever He wills. And whoever is granted wisdom is certainly blessed with a great privilege. But none will be mindful ˹of this˺ except people of reason
