quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  43,11,"And ˹He is the One˺ Who sends down rain from the sky in perfect measure, with which We give life to a lifeless land. And so will you be brought forth ˹from the grave˺"
  43,12,"And ˹He is the One˺ Who created all ˹things in˺ pairs, and made for you ships and animals to ride"
  43,13,"so that you may sit firmly on their backs, and remember your Lord’s blessings once you are settled on them, saying, “Glory be to the One Who has subjected these for us, for we could have never done so ˹on our own˺"
  43,14,And surely to our Lord we will ˹all˺ return.”
  43,15,"Still the pagans have made some of His creation out to be a part of Him. Indeed, humankind is clearly ungrateful"
  43,16,"Has He taken ˹angels as His˺ daughters from what He created, and favoured you ˹O pagans˺ with sons"
  43,17,"Whenever one of them is given the good news of what they attribute to the Most Compassionate, his face grows gloomy, as he suppresses his rage"
  43,18,˹Do they attribute to Him˺ those who are brought up in fineries and are not commanding in disputes
  43,19,"Still they have labelled the angels, who are servants of the Most Compassionate, as female. Did they witness their creation? Their statement will be recorded, and they will be questioned"
  43,20,"And they argue, “Had the Most Compassionate willed, we would have never worshipped them.” They have no knowledge ˹in support˺ of this ˹claim˺. They do nothing but lie"
  43,21,"Or have We given them a Book ˹for proof˺, before this ˹Quran˺, to which they are holding firm"
  43,22,"In fact, they say, “We found our forefathers following a ˹particular˺ way, and we are following in their footsteps.”"
