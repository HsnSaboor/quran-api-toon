quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  38,62,"The tyrants will ask ˹one another˺, “But why do we not see those we considered to be lowly"
  38,63,Were we wrong in mocking them ˹in the world˺? Or do our eyes ˹just˺ fail to see them ˹in the Fire˺?”
  38,64,This dispute between the residents of the Fire will certainly come to pass
  38,65,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I am only a warner. And there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except God—the One, the Supreme"
  38,66,"˹He is the˺ Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything in between—the Almighty, Most Forgiving.”"
  38,67,"Say, “This ˹Quran˺ is momentous news"
  38,68,from which you ˹pagans˺ are turning away.”
  38,69,"˹And say,˺ “I had no knowledge of the highest assembly ˹in heaven˺ when they differed ˹concerning Adam˺"
  38,70,What is revealed to me is that I am only sent with a clear warning.”
  38,71,"˹Remember, O Prophet˺ when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to create a human being from clay"
  38,72,"So when I have fashioned him and had a spirit of My Own ˹creation˺ breathed into him, fall down in prostration to him.”"
  38,73,So the angels prostrated all together—
  38,74,"but not Iblîs, who acted arrogantly, becoming unfaithful"
  38,75,"God asked, “O Iblîs! What prevented you from prostrating to what I created with My Own Hands? Did you ˹just˺ become proud? Or have you always been arrogant?”"
  38,76,"He replied, “I am better than he is: You created me from fire and him from clay.”"
  38,77,"God commanded, “Then get out of Paradise, for you are truly cursed"
  38,78,And surely upon you is My condemnation until the Day of Judgment.”
  38,79,"Satan appealed, “My Lord! Then delay my end until the Day of their resurrection.”"
  38,80,"God said, “You will be delayed"
  38,81,until the appointed Day.”
  38,82,"Satan said, “By Your Glory! I will certainly mislead them all"
  38,83,except Your chosen servants among them.”
