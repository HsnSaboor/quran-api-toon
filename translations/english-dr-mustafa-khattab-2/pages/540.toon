quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  57,19,"˹As for˺ those who believe in God and His messengers, it is they who are ˹truly˺ the people of truth. And the martyrs, with their Lord, will have their reward and their light. But ˹as for˺ those who disbelieve and reject Our signs, it is they who will be the residents of the Hellfire"
  57,20,"Know that this worldly life is no more than play, amusement, luxury, mutual boasting, and competition in wealth and children. This is like rain that causes plants to grow, to the delight of the planters. But later the plants dry up and you see them wither, then they are reduced to chaff. And in the Hereafter there will be either severe punishment or forgiveness and pleasure of God, whereas the life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment"
  57,21,"˹So˺ compete with one another for forgiveness from your Lord and a Paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who believe in God and His messengers. This is the favour of God. He grants it to whoever He wills. And God is the Lord of infinite bounty"
  57,22,No calamity ˹or blessing˺ occurs on earth or in yourselves without being ˹written˺ in a Record before We bring it into being. This is certainly easy for God
  57,23,"˹We let you know this˺ so that you neither grieve over what you have missed nor boast over what He has granted you. For God does not like whoever is arrogant, boastful—"
  57,24,"those who are stingy and promote stinginess among people. And whoever turns away ˹should know that˺ God ˹alone˺ is truly the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy"
