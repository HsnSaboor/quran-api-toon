quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,Successful indeed are the believers
  23,2,those who humble themselves in prayer
  23,3,those who avoid idle talk
  23,4,those who pay alms-tax
  23,5,those who guard their chastity
  23,6,"except with their wives or those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession, for then they are free from blame"
  23,7,but whoever seeks beyond that are the transgressors
  23,8,˹the believers are also˺ those who are true to their trusts and covenants
  23,9,and those who are ˹properly˺ observant of their prayers
  23,10,These are the ones who will be awarded
  23,11,Paradise as their own. They will be there forever
  23,12,"And indeed, We created humankind from an extract of clay"
  23,13,then placed each ˹human˺ as a sperm-drop in a secure place
  23,14,"then We developed the drop into a clinging clot ˹of blood˺, then developed the clot into a lump ˹of flesh˺, then developed the lump into bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, then We brought it into being as a new creation. So Blessed is God, the Best of Creators"
  23,15,After that you will surely die
  23,16,then on the Day of Judgment you will be resurrected
  23,17,"And indeed, We created above you seven levels ˹of heaven˺. We are never unmindful of ˹Our˺ creation"
