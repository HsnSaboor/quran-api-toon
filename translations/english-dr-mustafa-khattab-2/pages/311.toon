quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Have you seen ˹O Prophet˺ the one who rejects Our revelations yet boasts, “I will definitely be granted ˹plenty of˺ wealth and children ˹if there is an afterlife˺.”"
  19,78,Has he looked into the unseen or taken a pledge from the Most Compassionate
  19,79,Not at all! We certainly record whatever he claims and will increase his punishment extensively
  19,80,"And We will inherit what he boasts of, and he will come before Us all by himself"
  19,81,"They have taken other gods, instead of God, seeking strength ˹and protection˺ through them"
  19,82,But no! Those ˹gods˺ will deny their worship and turn against them
  19,83,"Do you ˹O Prophet˺ not see that We have sent the devils against the disbelievers, constantly inciting them"
  19,84,"So do not be in haste against them, for indeed We are ˹closely˺ counting down their days"
  19,85,˹Watch for˺ the Day We will gather the righteous before the Most Compassionate as an honoured delegation
  19,86,and drive the wicked to Hell like a thirsty herd
  19,87,"None will have the right to intercede, except those who have taken a covenant from the Most Compassionate"
  19,88,"They say, “The Most Compassionate has offspring.”"
  19,89,You have certainly made an outrageous claim
  19,90,"by which the heavens are about to burst, the earth to split apart, and the mountains to crumble to pieces"
  19,91,in protest of attributing children to the Most Compassionate
  19,92,It does not befit ˹the majesty of˺ the Most Compassionate to have children
  19,93,There is none in the heavens or the earth who will not return to the Most Compassionate in full submission
  19,94,"Indeed, He fully knows them and has counted them precisely"
  19,95,And each of them will return to Him on the Day of Judgment all alone
