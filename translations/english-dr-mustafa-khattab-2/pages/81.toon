quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  4,20,"If you desire to replace a wife with another and you have given the former ˹even˺ a stack of gold ˹as a dowry˺, do not take any of it back. Would you ˹still˺ take it unjustly and very sinfully"
  4,21,And how could you take it back after having enjoyed each other intimately and she has taken from you a firm commitment
  4,22,"Do not marry former wives of your fathers—except what was done previously. It was indeed a shameful, despicable, and evil practice"
  4,23,"˹Also˺ forbidden to you for marriage are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal and maternal aunts, your brother’s daughters, your sister’s daughters, your foster-mothers, your foster-sisters, your mothers-in-law, your stepdaughters under your guardianship if you have consummated marriage with their mothers—but if you have not, then you can marry them—nor the wives of your own sons, nor two sisters together at the same time—except what was done previously. Surely God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
