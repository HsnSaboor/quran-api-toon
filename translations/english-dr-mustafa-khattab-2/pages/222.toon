quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,6,There is no moving creature on earth whose provision is not guaranteed by God. And He knows where it lives and where it is laid to rest. All is ˹written˺ in a perfect Record
  11,7,"He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days—and His Throne was upon the waters—in order to test which of you is best in deeds. And if you ˹O Prophet˺ say, “Surely you will ˹all˺ be raised up after death,” the disbelievers will certainly say, “That is nothing but pure magic!”"
  11,8,"And if We delay their punishment until an appointed time, they will definitely say, “What is holding it back?” Indeed, on the Day it overtakes them, it will not be averted from them, and they will be overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule"
  11,9,"If We give people a taste of Our mercy then take it away from them, they become utterly desperate, ungrateful"
  11,10,"But if We give them a taste of prosperity after being touched with adversity, they say, “My ills are gone,” and become totally prideful and boastful"
  11,11,except those who patiently endure and do good. It is they who will have forgiveness and a mighty reward
  11,12,"Perhaps you ˹O Prophet˺ may wish to give up some of what is revealed to you and may be distressed by it because they say, “If only a treasure had been sent down to him, or an angel had come with him!” You are only a warner, and God is the Trustee of All Affairs"
