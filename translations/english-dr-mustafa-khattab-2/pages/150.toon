quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,158,"Are they awaiting the coming of the angels, or your Lord ˹Himself˺, or some of your Lord’s ˹major˺ signs? On the Day your Lord’s signs arrive, belief will not benefit those who did not believe earlier or those who did no good through their faith. Say, “Keep waiting! We too are waiting.”"
  6,159,"Indeed, you ˹O Prophet˺ are not responsible whatsoever for those who have divided their faith and split into sects. Their judgment rests only with God. And He will inform them of what they used to do"
  6,160,Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded tenfold. But whoever comes with a bad deed will be punished for only one. None will be wronged
  6,161,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Surely my Lord has guided me to the Straight Path, a perfect way, the faith of Abraham, the upright, who was not one of the polytheists.”"
  6,162,"Say, “Surely my prayer, my worship, my life, and my death are all for God—Lord of all worlds"
  6,163,"He has no partner. So I am commanded, and so I am the first to submit.”"
  6,164,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Should I seek a lord other than God while He is the Lord of everything?” No one will reap except what they sow. No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you of your differences"
  6,165,"He is the One Who has placed you as successors on earth and elevated some of you in rank over others, so He may test you with what He has given you. Surely your Lord is swift in punishment, but He is certainly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
