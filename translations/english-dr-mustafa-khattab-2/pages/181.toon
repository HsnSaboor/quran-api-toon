quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  8,34,"And why should God not punish them while they hinder pilgrims from the Sacred Mosque, claiming to be its rightful guardians? None has the right to guardianship except those mindful ˹of God˺, but most pagans do not know"
  8,35,Their prayer at the Sacred House was nothing but whistling and clapping. So taste the punishment for your disbelief
  8,36,Surely the disbelievers spend their wealth to hinder others from the Path of God. They will continue to spend to the point of regret. Then they will be defeated and the disbelievers will be driven into Hell
  8,37,so God may separate the evil from the good. He will pile up the evil ones all together and then cast them into Hell. They are the ˹true˺ losers
  8,38,"Tell the disbelievers that if they desist, their past will be forgiven. But if they persist, then they have an example in those destroyed before them"
  8,39,"Fight against them until there is no more persecution—and ˹your˺ devotion will be entirely to God. But if they desist, then surely God is All-Seeing of what they do"
  8,40,"And if they do not comply, then know that God is your Protector. What an excellent Protector, and what an excellent Helper"
