quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,147,"But if they deny you ˹O Prophet˺, say, “Your Lord is infinite in mercy, yet His punishment will not be averted from the wicked people.”"
  6,148,"The polytheists will argue, “Had it been God’s Will, neither we nor our forefathers would have associated others with Him ˹in worship˺ or made anything unlawful.” Likewise, those before them rejected the truth until they tasted Our punishment. Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? Surely you follow nothing but ˹false˺ assumptions and you do nothing but lie.”"
  6,149,"Say, “God has the most conclusive argument. Had it been His Will, He would have easily imposed guidance upon all of you.”"
  6,150,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Bring your witnesses who can testify that God has forbidden this.” If they ˹falsely˺ testify, do not testify with them. And do not follow the desires of those who deny Our proofs, disbelieve in the Hereafter, and set up equals with their Lord"
  6,151,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Come! Let me recite to you what your Lord has forbidden to you: do not associate others with Him ˹in worship˺. ˹Do not fail to˺ honour your parents. Do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for you and for them. Do not come near indecencies, openly or secretly. Do not take a ˹human˺ life—made sacred by God—except with ˹legal˺ right. This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will understand"
