quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,7,"How can such polytheists have a treaty with God and His Messenger, except those you have made a treaty with at the Sacred Mosque? So, as long as they are true to you, be true to them. Indeed God loves those who are mindful ˹of Him˺"
  9,8,"How ˹can they have a treaty˺? If they were to have the upper hand over you, they would have no respect for kinship or treaty. They only flatter you with their tongues, but their hearts are in denial, and most of them are rebellious"
  9,9,"They chose a fleeting gain over God’s revelations, hindering ˹others˺ from His Way. Evil indeed is what they have done"
  9,10,They do not honour the bonds of kinship or treaties with the believers. It is they who are the transgressors
  9,11,"But if they repent, perform prayer, and pay alms-tax, then they are your brothers in faith. This is how We make the revelations clear for people of knowledge"
  9,12,"But if they break their oaths after making a pledge and attack your faith, then fight the champions of disbelief—who never honour their oaths—so perhaps they will desist"
  9,13,"Will you not fight those who have broken their oaths, conspired to expel the Messenger ˹from Mecca˺, and attacked you first? Do you fear them? God is more deserving of your fear, if you are ˹true˺ believers"
