  23,76,"And We have already seized them with torment, but they never humbled themselves to their Lord, nor did they ˹submissively˺ appeal ˹to Him˺"
  23,77,"But as soon as We open for them a gate of severe punishment, they will be utterly desperate"
  23,78,"He is the One Who created for you hearing, sight, and intellect. ˹Yet˺ you hardly give any thanks"
