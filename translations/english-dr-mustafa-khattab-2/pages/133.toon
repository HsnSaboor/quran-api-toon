quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,45,So the wrongdoers were utterly uprooted. And all praise is for God—Lord of all worlds
  6,46,"Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Imagine if God were to take away your hearing or sight, or seal your hearts—who else other than God could restore it?” See ˹O Prophet˺ how We vary the signs, yet they still turn away"
  6,47,"Ask, “Imagine if God’s punishment were to overwhelm you with or without warning—who would be destroyed other than the wrongdoers?”"
  6,48,"We have sent messengers only as deliverers of good news and as warners. Whoever believes and does good, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve"
  6,49,But those who deny Our signs will be afflicted with punishment for their rebelliousness
  6,50,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I do not say to you that I possess God’s treasuries or know the unseen, nor do I claim to be an angel. I only follow what is revealed to me.” Say, “Are those blind ˹to the truth˺ equal to those who can see? Will you not then reflect?”"
  6,51,Warn with this ˹Quran˺ those who are awed by the prospect of being gathered before their Lord—when they will have no protector or intercessor besides Him—so perhaps they will be mindful ˹of Him˺
  6,52,"˹O Prophet!˺ Do not dismiss those ˹poor believers˺ who invoke their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure. You are not accountable for them whatsoever, nor are they accountable for you. So do not dismiss them, or you will be one of the wrongdoers"
