quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  55,68,"In both will be fruit, palm trees, and pomegranates"
  55,69,Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny
  55,70,"In all Gardens will be noble, pleasant mates"
  55,71,Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny
  55,72,"˹They will be˺ maidens with gorgeous eyes, reserved in pavilions"
  55,73,Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny
  55,74,No human or jinn has ever touched these ˹maidens˺ before
  55,75,Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny
  55,76,All ˹believers˺ will be reclining on green cushions and splendid carpets
  55,77,Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny
  55,78,"Blessed is the Name of your Lord, full of Majesty and Honour"
  56,1,When the Inevitable Event takes place
  56,2,then no one can deny it has come
  56,3,It will debase ˹some˺ and elevate ˹others˺
  56,4,When the earth will be violently shaken
  56,5,and the mountains will be crushed to pieces
  56,6,becoming scattered ˹particles of˺ dust
  56,7,you will ˹all˺ be ˹divided into˺ three groups
  56,8,"the people of the right, how ˹blessed˺ will they be"
  56,9,"the people of the left, how ˹miserable˺ will they be"
  56,10,and the foremost ˹in faith˺ will be the foremost ˹in Paradise˺
  56,11,They are the ones nearest ˹to God˺
  56,12,in the Gardens of Bliss
  56,13,˹They will be˺ a multitude from earlier generations
  56,14,and a few from later generations
  56,15,˹All will be˺ on jewelled thrones
  56,16,reclining face to face
