quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,The people of Lot rejected the messengers
  26,161,"when their brother Lot said to them, “Will you not fear ˹God˺"
  26,162,I am truly a trustworthy messenger to you
  26,163,"So fear God, and obey me"
  26,164,I do not ask you for any reward for this ˹message˺. My reward is only from the Lord of all worlds
  26,165,Why do you ˹men˺ lust after fellow men
  26,166,"leaving the wives that your Lord has created for you? In fact, you are a transgressing people.”"
  26,167,"They threatened, “If you do not desist, O Lot, you will surely be expelled.”"
  26,168,"Lot responded, “I am truly one of those who despise your ˹shameful˺ practice"
  26,169,My Lord! Save me and my family from ˹the consequences of˺ what they do.”
  26,170,So We saved him and all of his family
  26,171,"except an old woman, who was one of the doomed"
  26,172,Then We utterly destroyed the rest
  26,173,pouring upon them a rain ˹of brimstone˺. How evil was the rain of those who had been warned
  26,174,Surely in this is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe
  26,175,"And your Lord is certainly the Almighty, Most Merciful"
  26,176,The residents of the Forest rejected the messengers
  26,177,"when Shu’aib said to them, “Will you not fear ˹God˺"
  26,178,I am truly a trustworthy messenger to you
  26,179,"So fear God, and obey me"
  26,180,I do not ask you for any reward for this ˹message˺. My reward is only from the Lord of all worlds
  26,181,"Give full measure, and cause no loss ˹to others˺"
  26,182,Weigh with an even balance
  26,183,and do not defraud people of their property. Nor go about spreading corruption in the land
