quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  59,4,"This is because they defied God and His Messenger. And whoever defies God, then God is truly severe in punishment"
  59,5,"Whatever palm trees you ˹believers˺ cut down or left standing intact, it was ˹all˺ by God’s Will, so that He might disgrace the rebellious"
  59,6,As for the gains God has turned over to His Messenger from them—you did not ˹even˺ spur on any horse or camel for such gains. But God gives authority to His messengers over whoever He wills. For God is Most Capable of everything
  59,7,"As for gains granted by God to His Messenger from the people of ˹other˺ lands, they are for God and the Messenger, his close relatives, orphans, the poor, and ˹needy˺ travellers so that wealth may not merely circulate among your rich. Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it. And whatever he forbids you from, leave it. And fear God. Surely God is severe in punishment"
  59,8,"˹Some of the gains will be˺ for poor emigrants who were driven out of their homes and wealth, seeking God’s bounty and pleasure, and standing up for God and His Messenger. They are the ones true in faith"
  59,9,"As for those who had settled in the city and ˹embraced˺ the faith before ˹the arrival of˺ the emigrants, they love whoever immigrates to them, never having a desire in their hearts for whatever ˹of the gains˺ is given to the emigrants. They give ˹the emigrants˺ preference over themselves even though they may be in need. And whoever is saved from the selfishness of their own souls, it is they who are ˹truly˺ successful"
