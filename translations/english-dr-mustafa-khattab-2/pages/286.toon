quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,39,"This is part of the wisdom which your Lord has revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺. And do not set up any other god with God ˹O humanity˺, or you will be cast into Hell, blameworthy, rejected"
  17,40,Has your Lord favoured you ˹pagans˺ with sons and taken angels as ˹His˺ daughters? You are truly making an outrageous claim
  17,41,"We have surely varied ˹the signs˺ in this Quran so perhaps they may be mindful, but it only drives them farther away"
  17,42,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Had there been other gods besides Him—as they claim—then they would have certainly sought a way to ˹challenge˺ the Lord of the Throne.”"
  17,43,Glorified and Highly Exalted is He above what they claim
  17,44,"The seven heavens, the earth, and all those in them glorify Him. There is not a single thing that does not glorify His praises—but you ˹simply˺ cannot comprehend their glorification. He is indeed Most Forbearing, All-Forgiving"
  17,45,"When you ˹O Prophet˺ recite the Quran, We put a hidden barrier between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter"
  17,46,"We have cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend it—and deafness in their ears. And when you mention your Lord alone in the Quran, they turn their backs in aversion"
  17,47,"We know best how they listen to your recitation and what they say privately—when the wrongdoers say, “You would only be following a bewitched man.”"
  17,48,See how they call you names ˹O Prophet˺! So they have gone so ˹far˺ astray that they cannot find the ˹Right˺ Way
  17,49,"And they say ˹mockingly˺, “When we are reduced to bones and ashes, will we really be raised as a new creation?”"
