quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,109,To God ˹alone˺ belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And to God ˹all˺ matters will be returned ˹for judgment˺
  3,110,"You are the best community ever raised for humanity—you encourage good, forbid evil, and believe in God. Had the People of the Book believed, it would have been better for them. Some of them are faithful, but most are rebellious"
  3,111,"They can never inflict harm on you, except a little annoyance. But if they meet you in battle, they will flee and they will have no helpers"
  3,112,"They will be stricken with disgrace wherever they go, unless they are protected by a covenant with God or a treaty with the people. They have invited the displeasure of God and have been branded with misery for rejecting God’s revelations and murdering ˹His˺ prophets unjustly. This is ˹a fair reward˺ for their disobedience and violations"
  3,113,"Yet they are not all alike: there are some among the People of the Book who are upright, who recite God’s revelations throughout the night, prostrating ˹in prayer˺"
  3,114,"They believe in God and the Last Day, encourage good and forbid evil, and race with one another in doing good. They are ˹truly˺ among the righteous"
  3,115,They will never be denied the reward for any good they have done. And God has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of those mindful ˹of Him˺
