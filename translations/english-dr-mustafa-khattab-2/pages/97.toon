quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"There is no good in most of their secret talks—except those encouraging charity, kindness, or reconciliation between people. And whoever does this seeking God’s pleasure, We will grant them a great reward"
  4,115,"And whoever defies the Messenger after guidance has become clear to them and follows a path other than that of the believers, We will let them pursue what they have chosen, then burn them in Hell—what an evil end"
  4,116,"Surely God does not forgive associating ˹others˺ with Him ˹in worship˺, but forgives anything else of whoever He wills. Indeed, whoever associates ˹others˺ with God has clearly gone far astray"
  4,117,"Instead of God, they only invoke female gods and they ˹actually˺ invoke none but a rebellious Satan—"
  4,118,"cursed by God—who said, “I will surely take hold of a certain number of Your servants"
  4,119,"I will certainly mislead them and delude them with empty hopes. Also, I will order them and they will slit the ears of cattle and alter God’s creation.” And whoever takes Satan as a guardian instead of God has certainly suffered a tremendous loss"
  4,120,Satan only makes them ˹false˺ promises and deludes them with ˹empty˺ hopes. Truly Satan promises them nothing but delusion
  4,121,"It is they who will have Hell as their home, and they will find no escape from it"
