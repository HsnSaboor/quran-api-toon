quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,How can you disbelieve when God’s revelations are recited to you and His Messenger is in your midst? Whoever holds firmly to God is surely guided to the Straight Path
  3,102,"O believers! Be mindful of God in the way He deserves, and do not die except in ˹a state of full˺ submission ˹to Him˺"
  3,103,"And hold firmly to the rope of God and do not be divided. Remember God’s favour upon you when you were enemies, then He united your hearts, so you—by His grace—became brothers. And you were at the brink of a fiery pit and He saved you from it. This is how God makes His revelations clear to you, so that you may be ˹rightly˺ guided"
  3,104,"Let there be a group among you who call ˹others˺ to goodness, encourage what is good, and forbid what is evil—it is they who will be successful"
  3,105,And do not be like those who split ˹into sects˺ and differed after clear proofs had come to them. It is they who will suffer a tremendous punishment
  3,106,"On that Day some faces will be bright while others gloomy. To the gloomy-faced it will be said, “Did you disbelieve after having believed? So taste the punishment for your disbelief.”"
  3,107,"As for the bright-faced, they will be in God’s mercy, where they will remain forever"
  3,108,These are God’s revelations We recite to you ˹O Prophet˺ in truth. And God desires no injustice to ˹His˺ creation
