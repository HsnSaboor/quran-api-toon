quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,in which none will burn except the most wretched—
  92,16,who deny and turn away
  92,17,But the righteous will be spared from it—
  92,18,who donate ˹some of˺ their wealth only to purify themselves
  92,19,not in return for someone’s favours
  92,20,"but seeking the pleasure of their Lord, the Most High"
  92,21,They will certainly be pleased
  93,1,By the morning sunlight
  93,2,and the night when it falls still
  93,3,"Your Lord ˹O Prophet˺ has not abandoned you, nor has He become hateful ˹of you˺"
  93,4,And the next life is certainly far better for you than this one
  93,5,And ˹surely˺ your Lord will give so much to you that you will be pleased
  93,6,Did He not find you as an orphan then sheltered you
  93,7,Did He not find you unguided then guided you
  93,8,And did He not find you needy then satisfied your needs
  93,9,So do not oppress the orphan
  93,10,nor repulse the beggar
  93,11,And proclaim the blessings of your Lord
  94,1,Have We not uplifted your heart for you ˹O Prophet˺
  94,2,relieved you of the burden
  94,3,which weighed so heavily on your back
  94,4,and elevated your renown for you
  94,5,"So, surely with hardship comes ease"
  94,6,Surely with ˹that˺ hardship comes ˹more˺ ease
  94,7,"So once you have fulfilled ˹your duty˺, strive ˹in devotion˺"
  94,8,turning to your Lord ˹alone˺ with hope
