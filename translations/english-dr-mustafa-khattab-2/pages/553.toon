quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  62,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth ˹constantly˺ glorifies God—the King, the Most Holy, the Almighty, the All-Wise"
  62,2,"He is the One Who raised for the illiterate ˹people˺ a messenger from among themselves—reciting to them His revelations, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and wisdom, for indeed they had previously been clearly astray—"
  62,3,"along with others of them who have not yet joined them ˹in faith˺. For He is the Almighty, All-Wise"
  62,4,This is the favour of God. He grants it to whoever He wills. And God is the Lord of infinite bounty
  62,5,"The example of those who were entrusted with ˹observing˺ the Torah but failed to do so, is that of a donkey carrying books. How evil is the example of those who reject God’s signs! For God does not guide the wrongdoing people"
  62,6,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O Jews! If you claim to be God’s chosen ˹people˺ out of all humanity, then wish for death, if what you say is true.”"
  62,7,But they will never wish for that because of what their hands have done. And God has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the wrongdoers
  62,8,"Say, “The death you are running away from will inevitably come to you. Then you will be returned to the Knower of the seen and unseen, and He will inform you of what you used to do.”"
