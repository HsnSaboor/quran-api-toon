quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,73,"O Prophet! Struggle against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm with them. Hell will be their home. What an evil destination"
  9,74,"They swear by God that they never said anything ˹blasphemous˺, while they did in fact utter a blasphemy, lost faith after accepting Islam, and plotted what they could not carry out. It is only through resentment that they pay God and His Messenger back for enriching them out of His bounty! If they repent, it will be better for them. But if they turn away, God will torment them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have no one on earth to protect or help them"
  9,75,"And there are some who had made a vow to God: “If He gives us from His bounty, we will surely spend in charity and be of the righteous.”"
  9,76,"But when He gave them out of His bounty, they withheld it and turned away indifferently"
  9,77,"So He caused hypocrisy to plague their hearts until the Day they will meet Him, for breaking their promise to God and for their lies"
  9,78,"Do they not know that God ˹fully˺ knows their ˹evil˺ thoughts and secret talks, and that God is the Knower of all unseen"
  9,79,"˹There are˺ those who slander ˹some of˺ the believers for donating liberally and mock others for giving only the little they can afford. God will throw their mockery back at them, and they will suffer a painful punishment"
