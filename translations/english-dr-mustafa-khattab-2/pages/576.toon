quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,for he contemplated and determined ˹a degrading label for the Quran˺
  74,19,May he be condemned! How evil was what he determined
  74,20,May he be condemned even more! How evil was what he determined
  74,21,Then he re-contemplated ˹in frustration˺
  74,22,then frowned and scowled
  74,23,then turned his back ˹on the truth˺ and acted arrogantly
  74,24,"saying, “This ˹Quran˺ is nothing but magic from the ancients"
  74,25,This is no more than the word of a man.”
  74,26,Soon I will burn him in Hell
  74,27,And what will make you realize what Hell is
  74,28,It does not let anyone live or die
  74,29,scorching the skin
  74,30,It is overseen by nineteen ˹keepers˺
  74,31,"We have appointed only ˹stern˺ angels as wardens of the Fire. And We have made their number only as a test for the disbelievers, so that the People of the Book will be certain, and the believers will increase in faith, and neither the People of the Book nor the believers will have any doubts, and so that those ˹hypocrites˺ with sickness in their hearts and the disbelievers will argue, “What does God mean by such a number?” In this way God leaves whoever He wills to stray and guides whoever He wills. And none knows the forces of your Lord except He. And this ˹description of Hell˺ is only a reminder to humanity"
  74,32,But no! By the moon
  74,33,and the night as it retreats
  74,34,and the day as it breaks
  74,35,Surely Hell is one of the mightiest catastrophes—
  74,36,a warning to humankind
  74,37,to whichever of you chooses to take the lead or lag behind
  74,38,Every soul will be detained for what it has done
  74,39,except the people of the right
  74,40,"who will be in Gardens, asking one another"
  74,41,about the wicked ˹who will then be asked˺
  74,42,“What has landed you in Hell?”
  74,43,"They will reply, “We were not of those who prayed"
  74,44,nor did we feed the poor
  74,45,We used to indulge ˹in falsehood˺ along with others
  74,46,and deny the Day of Judgment
  74,47,until the inevitable came to us.”
