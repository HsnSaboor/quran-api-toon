quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,"Indeed, the righteous will have salvation—"
  78,32,"Gardens, vineyards"
  78,33,and full-bosomed maidens of equal age
  78,34,and full cups ˹of pure wine˺
  78,35,never to hear any idle talk or lying therein—
  78,36,a ˹fitting˺ reward as a generous gift from your Lord
  78,37,"the Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything in between, the Most Compassionate. No one will dare speak to Him"
  78,38,"on the Day the ˹holy˺ spirit and the angels will stand in ranks. None will talk, except those granted permission by the Most Compassionate and whose words are true"
  78,39,That Day is the ˹ultimate˺ truth. So let whoever wills take the path leading back to their Lord
  78,40,"Indeed, We have warned you of an imminent punishment—the Day every person will see ˹the consequences of˺ what their hands have done, and the disbelievers will cry, “I wish I were dust.”"
  79,1,By those ˹angels˺ stripping out ˹evil souls˺ harshly
  79,2,and those pulling out ˹good souls˺ gently
  79,3,and those gliding ˹through heavens˺ swiftly
  79,4,and those taking the lead vigorously
  79,5,and those conducting affairs ˹obediently˺
  79,6,˹Consider˺ the Day ˹when˺ the quaking Blast will come to pass
  79,7,followed by a second Blast
  79,8,˹The deniers’˺ hearts on that Day will be trembling ˹in horror˺
  79,9,with their eyes downcast
  79,10,"˹But now˺ they ask ˹mockingly˺, “Will we really be restored to our former state"
  79,11,even after we have been reduced to decayed bones?”
  79,12,"Adding, “Then such a return would be a ˹total˺ loss ˹for us˺!”"
  79,13,"But indeed, it will take only one ˹mighty˺ Blast"
  79,14,and at once they will be above ground
  79,15,Has the story of Moses reached you ˹O Prophet˺
