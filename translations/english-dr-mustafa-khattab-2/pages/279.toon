quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,103,"And We surely know that they say, “No one is teaching him except a human.” But the man they refer to speaks a foreign tongue, whereas this ˹Quran˺ is ˹in˺ eloquent Arabic"
  16,104,"Surely those who do not believe in God’s revelations will never be guided by God, and they will suffer a painful punishment"
  16,105,"No one fabricates lies except those who disbelieve in God’s revelations, and it is they who are the ˹true˺ liars"
  16,106,"Whoever disbelieves in God after their belief—not those who are forced while their hearts are firm in faith, but those who embrace disbelief wholeheartedly—they will be condemned by God and suffer a tremendous punishment"
  16,107,This is because they prefer the life of this world over the Hereafter. Surely God never guides those who ˹choose to˺ disbelieve
  16,108,"They are the ones whose hearts, ears, and eyes are sealed by God, and it is they who are ˹truly˺ heedless"
  16,109,"Without a doubt, they will be the losers in the Hereafter"
  16,110,"As for those who emigrated after being compelled ˹to renounce Islam˺, then struggled ˹in God’s cause˺, and persevered, your Lord ˹O Prophet˺ is truly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful after all"
