  2,70,"Again they said, “Call upon your Lord so that He may make clear to us which cow, for all cows look the same to us. Then, God willing, we will be guided ˹to the right one˺.”"
  2,71,"He replied, “God says, ‘It should have been used neither to till the soil nor water the fields; wholesome and without blemish.’” They said, “Now you have come with the truth.” Yet they still slaughtered it hesitantly"
  2,72,"˹This is˺ when a man was killed and you disputed who the killer was, but God revealed what you concealed"
  2,73,"So We instructed, “Strike the dead body with a piece of the cow.” This is how ˹easily˺ God brings the dead to life, showing you His signs so that you may understand"
  2,74,"Even then your hearts became hardened like a rock or even harder, for some rocks gush rivers; others split, spilling water; while others are humbled in awe of God. And God is never unaware of what you do"
  2,75,"Do you ˹believers still˺ expect them to be true to you, though a group of them would hear the word of God then knowingly corrupt it after understanding it"
  2,76,"When they meet the believers they say, “We believe.” But in private they say ˹to each other˺, “Will you disclose to the believers the knowledge God has revealed to you, so that they may use it against you before your Lord? Do you not understand?”"
