quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  4,66,"If We had commanded them to sacrifice themselves or abandon their homes, none would have obeyed except for a few. Had they done what they were advised to do, it would have certainly been far better for them and more reassuring"
  4,67,and We would have granted them a great reward by Our grace
  4,68,and guided them to the Straight Path
  4,69,"And whoever obeys God and the Messenger will be in the company of those blessed by God: the prophets, the people of truth, the martyrs, and the righteous—what honourable company"
  4,70,"This is God’s favour, and God fully knows ˹who deserves it˺"
  4,71,O believers! Take your precautions and go forth either in groups or together
  4,72,"There will be some among you who will lag behind so that if you face a disaster, they will say, “God has blessed us for not being there among them.”"
  4,73,"But if you return with God’s bounties, they will say—as if there had been no bond between you—“We wish we had been there with them to share the great gain!”"
  4,74,Let those who would sacrifice this life for the Hereafter fight in the cause of God. And whoever fights in God’s cause—whether they achieve martyrdom or victory—We will honour them with a great reward
