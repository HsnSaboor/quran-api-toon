quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,But no! The wicked are certainly bound for Sijjîn ˹in the depths of Hell˺—
  83,8,and what will make you realize what Sijjîn is?—
  83,9,a fate ˹already˺ sealed
  83,10,Woe on that Day to the deniers—
  83,11,those who deny Judgment Day
  83,12,None would deny it except every evildoing transgressor
  83,13,"Whenever Our revelations are recited to them, they say, “Ancient fables!”"
  83,14,"But no! In fact, their hearts have been stained by all ˹the evil˺ they used to commit"
  83,15,"Undoubtedly, they will be sealed off from their Lord on that Day"
  83,16,"Moreover, they will surely burn in Hell"
  83,17,"and then be told, “This is what you used to deny.”"
  83,18,But no! The virtuous are certainly bound for ’Illiyûn ˹in elevated Gardens˺—
  83,19,and what will make you realize what ’Illiyûn is?—
  83,20,a fate ˹already˺ sealed
  83,21,witnessed by those nearest ˹to God˺
  83,22,Surely the virtuous will be in bliss
  83,23,"˹seated˺ on ˹canopied˺ couches, gazing around"
  83,24,You will recognize on their faces the glow of delight
  83,25,"They will be given a drink of sealed, pure wine"
  83,26,whose last sip will smell like musk. So let whoever aspires to this strive ˹diligently˺
  83,27,And this drink’s flavour will come from Tasnîm—
  83,28,a spring from which those nearest ˹to God˺ will drink
  83,29,"Indeed, the wicked used to laugh at the believers"
  83,30,wink to one another whenever they passed by
  83,31,and muse ˹over these exploits˺ upon returning to their own people
  83,32,"And when they saw the faithful, they would say, “These ˹people˺ are truly astray,”"
  83,33,even though they were not sent as keepers over the believers
  83,34,But on that Day the believers will be laughing at the disbelievers
