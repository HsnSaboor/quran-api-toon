  2,107,"Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs ˹only˺ to God, and you have no guardian or helper besides God"
  2,108,Or do you ˹believers˺ intend to ask of your Messenger as Moses was asked before? But whoever trades belief for disbelief has truly strayed from the Right Way
  2,109,"Many among the People of the Book wish they could turn you ˹believers˺ back to disbelief because of their envy, after the truth has been made clear to them. Pardon and bear with them until God delivers His decision. Surely God is Most Capable of everything"
  2,110,"Establish prayer, and pay alms-tax. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will ˹certainly˺ find ˹its reward˺ with God. Surely God is All-Seeing of what you do"
  2,111,"The Jews and Christians each claim that none will enter Paradise except those of their own faith. These are their desires. Reply, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Show ˹me˺ your proof if what you say is true.”"
  2,112,"But no! Whoever submits themselves to God and does good will have their reward with their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve"
