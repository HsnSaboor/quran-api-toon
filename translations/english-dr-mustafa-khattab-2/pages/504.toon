quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  46,15,"We have commanded people to honour their parents. Their mothers bore them in hardship and delivered them in hardship. Their ˹period of˺ bearing and weaning is thirty months. In time, when the child reaches their prime at the age of forty, they pray, “My Lord! Inspire me to ˹always˺ be thankful for Your favours which You blessed me and my parents with, and to do good deeds that please You. And instil righteousness in my offspring. I truly repent to You, and I truly submit ˹to Your Will˺.”"
  46,16,"It is from these ˹people˺ that We will accept the good they did, and overlook their misdeeds—along with the residents of Paradise, ˹in fulfilment of˺ the true promise they have been given"
  46,17,"But some scold their parents, “Enough with you! Are you warning me that I will be brought forth ˹from the grave˺, while many generations had already perished before me ˹for good˺?” The parents cry to God for help, ˹and warn their child,˺ “Pity you. Have faith! Surely God’s promise is true.” But the deniers insist, “This is nothing but ancient fables.”"
  46,18,"These are the ones against whom the fate of earlier communities of jinn and humans has been justified, ˹for˺ they were truly losers"
  46,19,Each ˹of the two groups˺ will be ranked according to what they have done so He may fully reward all. And none will be wronged
  46,20,"˹Watch for˺ the Day ˹when˺ the disbelievers will be exposed to the Fire. ˹They will be told,˺ “You ˹already˺ exhausted your ˹share of˺ pleasures during your worldly life, and ˹fully˺ enjoyed them. So Today you will be rewarded with the torment of disgrace for your arrogance throughout the land with no right, and for your rebelliousness.”"
