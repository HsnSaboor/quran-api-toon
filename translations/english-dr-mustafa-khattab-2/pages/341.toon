quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  22,73,"O humanity! A lesson is set forth, so listen to it ˹carefully˺: those ˹idols˺ you invoke besides God can never create ˹so much as˺ a fly, even if they ˹all˺ were to come together for that. And if a fly were to snatch anything away from them, they cannot ˹even˺ retrieve it from the fly. How powerless are those who invoke and those invoked"
  22,74,"They have not shown God the reverence He deserves. Surely God is All-Powerful, Almighty"
  22,75,"God selects messengers from both angels and people, for God is truly All-Hearing, All-Seeing"
  22,76,He knows what is ahead of them and what is behind them. And to God ˹all˺ matters will be returned ˹for judgment˺
  22,77,"O believers! Bow down, prostrate yourselves, worship your Lord, and do ˹what is˺ good so that you may be successful"
  22,78,"Strive for ˹the cause of˺ God in the way He deserves, for ˹it is˺ He ˹Who˺ has chosen you, and laid upon you no hardship in the religion—the way of your forefather Abraham. ˹It is God˺ Who named you ‘the ones who submit’ ˹in the˺ earlier ˹Scriptures˺ and in this ˹Quran˺, so that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and that you may be witnesses over humanity. So establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and hold fast to God. He ˹alone˺ is your Guardian. What an excellent Guardian, and what an excellent Helper"
