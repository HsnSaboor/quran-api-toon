quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,"And among us are those who have submitted ˹to God˺ and those who are deviant. So ˹as for˺ those who submitted, it is they who have attained Right Guidance"
  72,15,"And as for the deviant, they will be fuel for Hell.’”"
  72,16,"Had the deniers followed the Right Way, We would have certainly granted them abundant rain to drink—"
  72,17,as a test for them. And whoever turns away from the remembrance of their Lord will be admitted by Him into an overwhelming punishment
  72,18,"The places of worship are ˹only˺ for God, so do not invoke anyone besides Him"
  72,19,"Yet when the servant of God stood up calling upon Him ˹alone˺, the pagans almost swarmed over him"
  72,20,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I call only upon my Lord, associating none with Him ˹in worship˺.”"
  72,21,"Say, “It is not in my power to harm or benefit you.”"
  72,22,"Say, “No one can protect me from God ˹if I were to disobey Him˺, nor can I find any refuge other than Him"
  72,23,"˹My duty is˺ only to convey ˹the truth˺ from God and ˹deliver˺ His messages.” And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger will certainly be in the Fire of Hell, to stay there for ever and ever"
  72,24,Only when they see what they have been threatened with will they know who is weaker in helpers and inferior in manpower
  72,25,"Say, “I do not know if what you are promised is near or my Lord has set a distant time for it"
  72,26,"˹He is the˺ Knower of the unseen, disclosing none of it to anyone"
  72,27,except messengers of His choice. Then He appoints angel-guards before and behind them
  72,28,"to ensure that the messengers fully deliver the messages of their Lord—though He ˹already˺ knows all about them, and keeps account of everything.”"
