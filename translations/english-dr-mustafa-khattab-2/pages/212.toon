quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,26,Those who do good will have the finest reward and ˹even˺ more. Neither gloom nor disgrace will cover their faces. It is they who will be the residents of Paradise. They will be there forever
  10,27,"As for those who commit evil, the reward of an evil deed is its equivalent. Humiliation will cover them—with no one to protect them from God—as if their faces were covered with patches of the night’s deep darkness. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever"
  10,28,"˹Consider˺ the Day We will gather them all together then say to those who associated others ˹with God in worship˺, “Stay in your places—you and your associate-gods.” We will separate them from each other, and their associate-gods will say, “It was not us that you worshipped"
  10,29,God is sufficient as a Witness between each of us that we were totally unaware of your worship.”
  10,30,Then and there every soul will face ˹the consequences of˺ what it had done. They all will be returned to God—their True Master. And whatever ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them
  10,31,"Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Who provides for you from heaven and earth? Who owns ˹your˺ hearing and sight? Who brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living? And who conducts every affair?” They will ˹surely˺ say, “God.” Say, “Will you not then fear ˹Him˺"
  10,32,That is God—your True Lord. So what is beyond the truth except falsehood? How can you then be turned away?”
  10,33,And so your Lord’s decree has been proven true against the rebellious—that they will never believe
