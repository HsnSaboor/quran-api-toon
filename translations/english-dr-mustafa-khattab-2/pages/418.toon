quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  33,1,"O Prophet! ˹Always˺ be mindful of God, and do not yield to the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Indeed, God is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  33,2,Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord. Surely God is All-Aware of what you ˹all˺ do
  33,3,"And put your trust in God, for God is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs"
  33,4,"God does not place two hearts in any person’s chest. Nor does He regard your wives as ˹unlawful for you like˺ your real mothers, ˹even˺ if you say they are. Nor does He regard your adopted children as your real children. These are only your baseless assertions. But God declares the truth, and He ˹alone˺ guides to the ˹Right˺ Way"
  33,5,"Let your adopted children keep their family names. That is more just in the sight of God. But if you do not know their fathers, then they are ˹simply˺ your fellow believers and close associates. There is no blame on you for what you do by mistake, but ˹only˺ for what you do intentionally. And God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  33,6,"The Prophet has a stronger affinity to the believers than they do themselves. And his wives are their mothers. As ordained by God, blood relatives are more entitled ˹to inheritance˺ than ˹other˺ believers and immigrants, unless you ˹want to˺ show kindness to your ˹close˺ associates ˹through bequest˺. This is decreed in the Record"
