quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,45,"God knows best who your enemies are! And God is sufficient as a Guardian, and He is sufficient as a Helper"
  4,46,"Some Jews take words out of context and say, “We listen and we disobey,” “Hear! May you never hear,” and “Râ’ina!” [Herd us!]—playing with words and discrediting the faith. Had they said ˹courteously˺, “We hear and obey,” “Listen to us,” and “Unẓurna,” [Tend to us!] it would have been better for them and more proper. God has condemned them for their disbelief, so they do not believe except for a few"
  4,47,"O you who were given the Book! Believe in what We have revealed—confirming your own Scriptures—before We wipe out ˹your˺ faces, turning them backwards, or We condemn the defiant as We did to the Sabbath-breakers. And God’s command is always executed"
  4,48,"Indeed, God does not forgive associating others with Him ˹in worship˺, but forgives anything else of whoever He wills. And whoever associates others with God has indeed committed a grave sin"
  4,49,Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who ˹falsely˺ elevate themselves? It is God who elevates whoever He wills. And none will be wronged ˹even by the width of˺ the thread of a date stone
  4,50,See how they fabricate lies against God—this alone is a blatant sin
  4,51,Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who were given a portion of the Scriptures yet believe in idols and false gods and reassure the disbelievers that they are better guided than the believers
