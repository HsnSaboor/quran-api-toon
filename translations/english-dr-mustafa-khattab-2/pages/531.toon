quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,"Our command is but a single word, done in the blink of an eye"
  54,51,We have already destroyed the likes of you. So will any ˹of you˺ be mindful
  54,52,Everything they have done is ˹listed˺ in ˹their˺ records
  54,53,"Every matter, small and large, is written ˹precisely˺"
  54,54,"Indeed, the righteous will be amid Gardens and rivers"
  54,55,at the Seat of Honour in the presence of the Most Powerful Sovereign
  55,1,The Most Compassionate
  55,2,taught the Quran
  55,3,created humanity
  55,4,˹and˺ taught them speech
  55,5,The sun and the moon ˹travel˺ with precision
  55,6,The stars and the trees bow down ˹in submission˺
  55,7,"As for the sky, He raised it ˹high˺, and set the balance ˹of justice˺"
  55,8,so that you do not defraud the scales
  55,9,"Weigh with justice, and do not give short measure"
  55,10,He laid out the earth for all beings
  55,11,"In it are fruit, palm trees with date stalks"
  55,12,"and grain with husks, and aromatic plants"
  55,13,Then which of your Lord’s favours will you ˹humans and jinn˺ both deny
  55,14,He created humankind from ˹sounding˺ clay like pottery
  55,15,and created jinn from a ˹smokeless˺ flame of fire
  55,16,Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny
