quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,116,"Indeed, neither the wealth nor children of the disbelievers will be of any benefit to them against God. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever"
  3,117,"The good they do in this worldly life is like the harvest of an evil people struck by a bitter wind, destroying it ˹completely˺. God never wronged them, but they wronged themselves"
  3,118,"O believers! Do not associate closely with others who would not miss a chance to harm you. Their only desire is to see you suffer. Their prejudice has become evident from what they say—and what their hearts hide is far worse. We have made Our revelations clear to you, if only you understood"
  3,119,"Here you are! You love them but they do not love you, and you believe in all Scriptures. When they meet you they say, “We believe.” But when alone, they bite their fingertips in rage. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹May you˺ die of your rage!” Surely God knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart"
  3,120,"When you ˹believers˺ are touched with good, they grieve; but when you are afflicted with evil, they rejoice. ˹Yet,˺ if you are patient and mindful ˹of God˺, their schemes will not harm you in the least. Surely God is Fully Aware of what they do"
  3,121,"˹Remember, O Prophet,˺ when you left your home in the early morning to position the believers in the battlefield. And God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
