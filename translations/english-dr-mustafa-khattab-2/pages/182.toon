quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  8,41,"Know that whatever spoils you take, one-fifth is for God and the Messenger, his close relatives, orphans, the poor, and ˹needy˺ travellers, if you ˹truly˺ believe in God and what We revealed to Our servant on that decisive day when the two armies met ˹at Badr˺. And God is Most Capable of everything"
  8,42,"˹Remember˺ when you were on the near side of the valley, your enemy on the far side, and the caravan was below you. Even if the two armies had made an appointment ˹to meet˺, both would have certainly missed it. Still it transpired so God may establish what He had destined—that those who were to perish and those who were to survive might do so after the truth had been made clear to both. Surely God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
  8,43,"˹Remember, O Prophet,˺ when God showed them in your dream as few in number. Had He shown them to you as many, you ˹believers˺ would have certainly faltered and disputed in the matter. But God spared you ˹from that˺. Surely He knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart"
  8,44,"Then when your armies met, God made them appear as few in your eyes, and made you appear as few in theirs, so God may establish what He had destined. And to God ˹all˺ matters will be returned ˹for judgment˺"
  8,45,"O believers! When you face an enemy, stand firm and remember God often so you may triumph"
