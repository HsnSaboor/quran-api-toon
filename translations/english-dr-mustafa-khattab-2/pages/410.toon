quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"Then if We send a ˹harsh˺ wind which they see withering ˹their˺ crops, they will definitely deny ˹old favours˺ right after"
  30,52,So you ˹O Prophet˺ certainly cannot make the dead hear ˹the truth˺. Nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs and walk away
  30,53,"Nor can you lead the blind out of their misguidance. You can make none hear ˹the truth˺ except those who believe in Our revelations, ˹fully˺ submitting ˹to God˺"
  30,54,"It is God Who created you in a state of weakness, then developed ˹your˺ weakness into strength, then developed ˹your˺ strength into weakness and old age. He creates whatever He wills. For He is the All-Knowing, Most Capable"
  30,55,"And on the Day the Hour will arrive, the wicked will swear that they did not stay ˹in this world˺ more than an hour. In this way they were always deluded ˹in the world˺"
  30,56,"But those gifted with knowledge and faith will say ˹to them˺, “You did actually stay—as destined by God—until the Day of Resurrection. So here is the Day of Resurrection ˹which you denied˺! But you did not know ˹it was true˺.”"
  30,57,"So on that Day the wrongdoers’ excuses will not benefit them, nor will they be allowed to appease ˹their Lord˺"
  30,58,"We have certainly set forth every ˹kind of˺ lesson for people in this Quran. And no matter what sign you bring to them ˹O Prophet˺, the disbelievers will definitely say ˹to the believers˺, “You are only a people of falsehood.”"
  30,59,This is how God seals the hearts of those unwilling to know ˹the truth˺
  30,60,"So be patient, for the promise of God certainly is true. And do not be disturbed by those who have no sure faith"
