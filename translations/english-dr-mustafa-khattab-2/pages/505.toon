quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  46,21,"And remember the brother of ’Ȃd, when he warned his people, who inhabited the sand-hills—there were certainly warners before and after him—˹saying,˺ “Worship none but God. I truly fear for you the torment of a tremendous day.”"

  46,25,"It destroyed everything by the command of its Lord, leaving nothing visible except their ruins. This is how We reward the wicked people"
  46,26,"Indeed, We had established them in a way We have not established you ˹Meccans˺. And We gave them hearing, sight, and intellect. But neither their hearing, sight, nor intellect were of any benefit to them whatsoever, since they persisted in denying God’s signs. And ˹so˺ they were overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule"
  46,27,We certainly destroyed the societies around you after having varied the signs so perhaps they would return ˹to the Right Path˺
  46,28,"Why then did those ˹idols˺ they took as gods—hoping to get closer ˹to Him˺—not come to their aid? Instead, they failed them. That is ˹the result of˺ their lies and their fabrications"
