quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  28,85,"Most certainly, the One Who has ordained the Quran for you will ˹ultimately˺ bring you back home ˹to Mecca˺. Say, “My Lord knows best who has come with ˹true˺ guidance and who is clearly astray.”"
  28,86,"You never expected this Book to be revealed to you, but ˹it came˺ only ˹as˺ a mercy from your Lord. So never side with the disbelievers ˹in their disbelief˺"
  28,87,"Do not let them turn you away from the revelations of God after they have been sent down to you. Rather, invite ˹all˺ to ˹the Way of˺ your Lord, and never be one of the polytheists"
  28,88,And do not invoke any other god with God. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. Everything is bound to perish except He Himself. All authority belongs to Him. And to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned
  29,1,Alif-Lãm-Mĩm
  29,2,"Do people think once they say, “We believe,” that they will be left without being put to the test"
  29,3,We certainly tested those before them. And ˹in this way˺ God will clearly distinguish between those who are truthful and those who are liars
  29,4,Or do the evildoers ˹simply˺ think that they will escape Us? How wrong is their judgment
  29,5,"Whoever hopes for the meeting with God, ˹let them know that˺ God’s appointed time is sure to come. He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
  29,6,"And whoever strives ˹in God’s cause˺, only does so for their own good. Surely God is not in need of ˹any of˺ His creation"
