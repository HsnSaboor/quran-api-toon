quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,68,conveying to you my Lord’s messages. And I am your sincere advisor
  7,69,"Do you find it astonishing that a reminder should come to you from your Lord through one of your own so he may warn you? Remember that He made you successors after the people of Noah and increased you greatly in stature. So remember God’s favours, so you may be successful.”"
  7,70,"They said, “Have you come to us so that we would worship God alone and abandon what our forefathers used to worship? Then bring us what you threaten us with, if what you say is true!”"
  7,71,"He said, “You will certainly be subjected to your Lord’s torment and wrath. Do you dispute with me regarding the so-called gods which you and your forefathers have made up—a practice God has never authorized? Then wait! I too am waiting with you.”"
  7,72,So We saved him and those with him by Our mercy and uprooted those who denied Our signs. They were not believers
  7,73,"And to the people of Thamûd We sent their brother Ṣâliḥ. He said, “O my people! Worship God—you have no other god except Him. A clear proof has come to you from your Lord: this is God’s she-camel as a sign to you. So leave her to graze ˹freely˺ on God’s land and do not harm her, or else you will be overcome by a painful punishment"
