quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,62,"They swear by God to you ˹believers˺ in order to please you, while it is the pleasure of God and His Messenger they should seek, if they are ˹true˺ believers"
  9,63,Do they not know that whoever opposes God and His Messenger will be in the Fire of Hell forever? That is the ultimate disgrace
  9,64,"The hypocrites fear that a sûrah should be revealed about them, exposing what is in their hearts. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Keep mocking! God will definitely bring to light what you fear.”"
  9,65,"If you question them, they will certainly say, “We were only talking idly and joking around.” Say, “Was it God, His revelations, and His Messenger that you ridiculed?”"
  9,66,"Make no excuses! You have lost faith after your belief. If We pardon a group of you, We will punish others for their wickedness"
  9,67,"The hypocrites, both men and women, are all alike: they encourage what is evil, forbid what is good, and withhold ˹what is in˺ their hands. They neglected God, so He neglected them. Surely the hypocrites are the rebellious"
  9,68,"God has promised the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers an everlasting stay in the Fire of Hell—it is sufficient for them. God has condemned them, and they will suffer a never-ending punishment"
