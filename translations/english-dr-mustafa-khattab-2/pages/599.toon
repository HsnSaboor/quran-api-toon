quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  98,8,"Their reward with their Lord will be Gardens of Eternity, under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. God is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. This is ˹only˺ for those in awe of their Lord"
  99,1,When the earth is shaken ˹in˺ its ultimate quaking
  99,2,and when the earth throws out ˹all˺ its contents
  99,3,"and humanity cries, “What is wrong with it?”—"
  99,4,on that Day the earth will recount everything
  99,5,having been inspired by your Lord ˹to do so˺
  99,6,On that Day people will proceed in separate groups to be shown ˹the consequences of˺ their deeds
  99,7,So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it
  99,8,And whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it
  100,1,"’ By the galloping, panting horses"
  100,2,striking sparks of fire ˹with their hoofs˺
  100,3,launching raids at dawn
  100,4,stirring up ˹clouds of˺ dust
  100,5,and penetrating into the heart of enemy lines
  100,6,Surely humankind is ungrateful to their Lord—
  100,7,and they certainly attest to this—
  100,8,and they are truly extreme in their love of ˹worldly˺ gains
  100,9,Do they not know that when the contents of the graves will be spilled out
