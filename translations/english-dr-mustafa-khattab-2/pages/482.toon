quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"With Him ˹alone˺ is the knowledge of the Hour. No fruit comes out of its husk, nor does a female conceive or deliver without His knowledge. And ˹consider˺ the Day He will call to them, “Where are My ˹so-called˺ associate-gods?” They will cry, “We declare before you that none of us testifies to that ˹any longer˺.”"
  41,48,Whatever ˹idols˺ they used to invoke besides God will fail them. And they will realize that they will have no escape
  41,49,"One never tires of praying for good. And if touched with evil, they become desperate and hopeless"
  41,50,"And if We let them taste a mercy from Us after being touched with adversity, they will certainly say, “This is what I deserve. I do not think the Hour will ˹ever˺ come. And if in fact I am returned to my Lord, the finest reward with Him will definitely be mine.” But We will surely inform the disbelievers of what they used to do. And We will certainly make them taste a harsh torment"
  41,51,"When We show favour to someone, they turn away, acting arrogantly. And when touched with evil, they make endless prayers ˹for good˺"
  41,52,"Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Imagine if this ˹Quran˺ is ˹truly˺ from God and you deny it: who can be more astray than those who have gone too far in opposition ˹to the truth˺?”"
  41,53,We will show them Our signs in the universe and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that this ˹Quran˺ is the truth. Is it not enough that your Lord is a Witness over all things
  41,54,They are truly in doubt of the meeting with their Lord! ˹But˺ He is indeed Fully Aware of everything
