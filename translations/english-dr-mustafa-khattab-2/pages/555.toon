quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"When it is said to them, “Come! The Messenger of God will pray for you to be forgiven,” they turn their heads ˹in disgust˺, and you see them ˹O Prophet˺ turn away in arrogance"
  63,6,"It is the same whether you pray for their forgiveness or not, God will not forgive them. Surely God does not guide the rebellious people"
  63,7,"They are the ones who say ˹to one another˺, “Do not spend ˹anything˺ on those ˹emigrants˺ with the Messenger of God so that they will break away ˹from him˺.” But to God ˹alone˺ belong the treasuries of the heavens and the earth, yet the hypocrites do not comprehend"
  63,8,"They say, “If we return to Medina, the honourable will definitely expel the inferior.” But all honour and power belongs to God, His Messenger, and the believers, yet the hypocrites do not know"
  63,9,"O believers! Do not let your wealth or your children divert you from the remembrance of God. For whoever does so, it is they who are the ˹true˺ losers"
  63,10,"And donate from what We have provided for you before death comes to one of you, and you cry, “My Lord! If only You delayed me for a short while, I would give in charity and be one of the righteous.”"
  63,11,But God never delays a soul when its appointed time comes. And God is All-Aware of what you do
