quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  7,31,"O Children of Adam! Dress properly whenever you are at worship. Eat and drink, but do not waste. Surely He does not like the wasteful"
  7,32,"Ask, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Who has forbidden the adornments and lawful provisions God has brought forth for His servants?” Say, “They are for the enjoyment of the believers in this worldly life, but they will be exclusively theirs on the Day of Judgment. This is how We make Our revelations clear for people of knowledge.”"
  7,33,"Say, “My Lord has only forbidden open and secret indecencies, sinfulness, unjust aggression, associating ˹others˺ with God ˹in worship˺—a practice He has never authorized—and attributing to God what you do not know.”"
  7,34,"For each community there is an appointed term. When their time arrives, they can neither delay it for a moment, nor could they advance it"
  7,35,"O children of Adam! When messengers from among yourselves come to you reciting My revelations—whoever shuns evil and mends their ways, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve"
  7,36,But those who receive Our revelations with denial and arrogance will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever
  7,37,"Who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against God or deny His revelations? They will receive what is destined for them, until Our messenger-angels arrive to take their souls, asking them, “Where are those ˹false gods˺ you used to invoke besides God?” They will cry, “They have failed us,” and they will confess against themselves that they were indeed disbelievers"
