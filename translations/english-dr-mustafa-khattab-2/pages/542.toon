quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  58,1,"Indeed, God has heard the argument of the woman who pleaded with you ˹O Prophet˺ concerning her husband, and appealed to God. God has heard your exchange. Surely God is All-Hearing, All-Seeing"
  58,2,"Those of you who ˹sinfully˺ divorce their wives by comparing them to their mothers ˹should know that˺ their wives are in no way their mothers. None can be their mothers except those who gave birth to them. What they say is certainly detestable and false. Yet God is truly Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving"
  58,3,"Those who divorce their wives in this manner, then ˹wish to˺ retract what they said, must free a slave before they touch each other. This ˹penalty˺ is meant to deter you. And God is All-Aware of what you do"
  58,4,"But if the husband cannot afford this, let him then fast two consecutive months before the couple touch each other. But if he is unable ˹to fast˺, then let him feed sixty poor people. This is to re-affirm your faith in God and His Messenger. These are the limits set by God. And the disbelievers will suffer a painful punishment"
  58,5,"Indeed, those who defy God and His Messenger will be debased, just like those before them. We have certainly sent down clear revelations. And the disbelievers will suffer a humiliating punishment"
  58,6,"On the Day God resurrects them all together, He will then inform them of what they have done. God has kept account of it all, while they have forgotten it. For God is a Witness over all things"
