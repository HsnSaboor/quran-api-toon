quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  35,19,Those blind ˹to the truth˺ and those who can see are not equal
  35,20,nor are the darkness and the light
  35,21,nor the ˹scorching˺ heat and the ˹cool˺ shade
  35,22,"Nor are the dead and the living equal. Indeed, God ˹alone˺ makes whoever He wills hear, but you ˹O Prophet˺ can never make those in the graves hear ˹your call˺"
  35,23,You are only a warner
  35,24,We have surely sent you with the truth as a deliverer of good news and a warner. There is no community that has not had a warner
  35,25,"If they deny you, so did those before them. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, divine Books, and enlightening Scriptures"
  35,26,Then I seized those who persisted in disbelief. How severe was My response
  35,27,"Do you not see that God sends down rain from the sky with which We bring forth fruits of different colours? And in the mountains are streaks of varying shades of white, red, and raven black"
  35,28,"just as people, living beings, and cattle are of various colours as well. Of all of God’s servants, only the knowledgeable ˹of His might˺ are ˹truly˺ in awe of Him. God is indeed Almighty, All-Forgiving"
  35,29,"Surely those who recite the Book of God, establish prayer, and donate from what We have provided for them—secretly and openly—˹can˺ hope for an exchange that will never fail"
  35,30,"so that He will reward them in full and increase them out of His grace. He is truly All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative"
