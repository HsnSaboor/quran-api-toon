quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,164,"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth; the alternation of the day and the night; the ships that sail the sea for the benefit of humanity; the rain sent down by God from the skies, reviving the earth after its death; the scattering of all kinds of creatures throughout; the shifting of the winds; and the clouds drifting between the heavens and the earth—˹in all of this˺ are surely signs for people of understanding"
  2,165,"Still there are some who take others as God’s equal—they love them as they should love God—but the ˹true˺ believers love God even more. If only the wrongdoers could see the ˹horrible˺ punishment ˹awaiting them˺, they would certainly realize that all power belongs to God and that God is indeed severe in punishment"
  2,166,˹Consider the Day˺ when those who misled others will disown their followers—when they face the torment—and the bonds that united them will be cut off
  2,167,"The ˹misled˺ followers will cry, “If only we could have a second chance, we would disown them as they disowned us.” And so God will make them remorseful of their misdeeds. And they will never ˹be able to˺ leave the Fire"
  2,168,O humanity! Eat from what is lawful and good on the earth and do not follow Satan’s footsteps. He is truly your sworn enemy
  2,169,"He only incites you to commit evil and indecency, and to claim against God what you do not know"
