quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the stars when they fade away
  53,2,Your fellow man is neither misguided nor astray
  53,3,Nor does he speak of his own whims
  53,4,It is only a revelation sent down ˹to him˺
  53,5,He has been taught by one ˹angel˺ of mighty power
  53,6,"and great perfection, who once rose to ˹his˺ true form"
  53,7,while on the highest point above the horizon
  53,8,"then he approached ˹the Prophet˺, coming so close"
  53,9,that he was only two arms-lengths away or even less
  53,10,Then God revealed to His servant what He revealed ˹through Gabriel˺
  53,11,The ˹Prophet’s˺ heart did not doubt what he saw
  53,12,How can you ˹O pagans˺ then dispute with him regarding what he saw
  53,13,And he certainly saw that ˹angel descend˺ a second time
  53,14,at the Lote Tree of the most extreme limit ˹in the seventh heaven˺—
  53,15,near which is the Garden of ˹Eternal˺ Residence—
  53,16,while the Lote Tree was overwhelmed with ˹heavenly˺ splendours
  53,17,"The ˹Prophet’s˺ sight never wandered, nor did it overreach"
  53,18,He certainly saw some of his Lord’s greatest signs
  53,19,"Now, have you considered ˹the idols of˺ Lât and ’Uzza"
  53,20,"and the third one, Manât, as well"
  53,21,Do you ˹prefer to˺ have sons while ˹you attribute˺ to Him daughters
  53,22,Then this is ˹truly˺ a biased distribution
  53,23,"These ˹idols˺ are mere names that you and your forefathers have made up—a practice God has never authorized. They follow nothing but ˹inherited˺ assumptions and whatever ˹their˺ souls desire, although ˹true˺ guidance has already come to them from their Lord"
  53,24,Or should every person ˹simply˺ have whatever ˹intercessors˺ they desire
  53,25,"In fact, to God ˹alone˺ belongs this world and the next"
  53,26,"˹Imagine˺ how many ˹noble˺ angels are in the heavens! ˹Even˺ their intercession would be of no benefit whatsoever, until God gives permission to whoever He wills and ˹only for the people He˺ approves"
