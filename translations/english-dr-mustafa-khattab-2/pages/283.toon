quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  17,8,"Perhaps your Lord will have mercy on you ˹if you repent˺, but if you return ˹to sin˺, We will return ˹to punishment˺. And We have made Hell a ˹permanent˺ confinement for the disbelievers.”"
  17,9,"Surely this Quran guides to what is most upright, and gives good news to the believers—who do good—that they will have a mighty reward"
  17,10,And ˹it warns˺ those who do not believe in the Hereafter ˹that˺ We have prepared for them a painful punishment
  17,11,And humans ˹swiftly˺ pray for evil as they pray for good. For humankind is ever hasty
  17,12,"We made the day and night as two signs. So We made the sign of the night devoid of light, and We made the sign of the day ˹perfectly˺ bright, so that you may seek the bounty of your Lord and know the number of years and calculation ˹of time˺. And We have explained everything in detail"
  17,13,We have bound every human’s destiny to their neck. And on the Day of Judgment We will bring forth to each ˹person˺ a record which they will find laid open
  17,14,"˹And it will be said,˺ “Read your record. You ˹alone˺ are sufficient this Day to take account of yourself.”"
  17,15,"Whoever chooses to be guided, it is only for their own good. And whoever chooses to stray, it is only to their own loss. No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. And We would never punish ˹a people˺ until We have sent a messenger ˹to warn them˺"
  17,16,"Whenever We intend to destroy a society, We command its elite ˹to obey God˺ but they act rebelliously in it. So the decree ˹of punishment˺ is justified, and We destroy it utterly"
  17,17,˹Imagine˺ how many peoples We have destroyed after Noah! And sufficient is your Lord as All-Aware and All-Seeing of the sins of His servants
