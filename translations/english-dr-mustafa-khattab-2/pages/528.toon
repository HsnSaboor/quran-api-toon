quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,And He created the pairs—males and females—
  53,46,from a sperm-drop when it is emitted
  53,47,And it is upon Him to bring about re-creation
  53,48,And He is the One Who enriches and impoverishes
  53,49,And He alone is the Lord of Sirius
  53,50,And He destroyed the first ˹people of˺ ’Ȃd
  53,51,"and ˹then˺ Thamûd, sparing no one"
  53,52,"And before ˹that He destroyed˺ the people of Noah, who were truly far worse in wrongdoing and transgression"
  53,53,And ˹it was˺ He ˹Who˺ turned the cities ˹of Sodom and Gomorrah˺ upside down
  53,54,How overwhelming was what covered ˹them˺
  53,55,"Now, which of your Lord’s favours will you dispute"
  53,56,This ˹Prophet˺ is a warner like earlier ones
  53,57,The approaching ˹Hour˺ has drawn near
  53,58,None but God can disclose it
  53,59,Do you find this revelation astonishing
  53,60,laughing ˹at it˺ and not weeping ˹in awe˺
  53,61,while persisting in heedlessness
  53,62,"Instead, prostrate to God and worship ˹Him alone˺"
  54,1,The Hour has drawn near and the moon was split ˹in two˺
  54,2,"Yet, whenever they see a sign, they turn away, saying, “Same old magic!”"
  54,3,They rejected ˹the truth˺ and followed their own desires—and every matter will be settled—
  54,4,even though the stories ˹of destroyed nations˺ that have already come to them are a sufficient deterrent
  54,5,"˹This Quran is˺ profound ˹in˺ wisdom, but warnings are of no benefit ˹to them˺"
  54,6,So turn away from them ˹O Prophet˺. ˹And wait for˺ the Day ˹when˺ the caller will summon ˹them˺ for something horrifying
