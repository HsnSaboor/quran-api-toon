quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,135,"The Jews and Christians each say, “Follow our faith to be ˹rightly˺ guided.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “No! We follow the faith of Abraham, the upright—who was not a polytheist.”"
  2,136,"Say, ˹O believers,˺ “We believe in God and what has been revealed to us; and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants; and what was given to Moses, Jesus, and other prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them. And to God we all submit.”"
  2,137,"So if they believe in what you believe, then they will indeed be ˹rightly˺ guided. But if they turn away, they are simply opposed ˹to the truth˺. But God will spare you their evil. For He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
  2,138,This is the ˹natural˺ Way of God. And who is better than God in ordaining a way? And we worship ˹none but˺ Him
  2,139,"Say, “Would you dispute with us about God, while He is our Lord and your Lord? We are accountable for our deeds and you for yours. And we are devoted to Him ˹alone˺"
  2,140,"Do you claim that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants were all Jews or Christians?” Say, “Who is more knowledgeable: you or God?” Who does more wrong than those who hide the testimony they received from God? And God is never unaware of what you do"
  2,141,That was a community that had already gone before. For them is what they earned and for you is what you have earned. And you will not be accountable for what they have done
