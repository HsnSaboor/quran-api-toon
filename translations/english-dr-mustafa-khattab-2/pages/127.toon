quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,114,"Jesus, son of Mary, prayed, “O God, our Lord! Send us from heaven a table spread with food as a feast for us—the first and last of us—and as a sign from You. Provide for us! You are indeed the Best Provider.”"
  5,115,"God answered, “I am sending it down to you. But whoever among you denies afterwards will be subjected to a torment I have never inflicted on anyone of My creation.”"
  5,116,"And ˹on Judgment Day˺ God will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Did you ever ask the people to worship you and your mother as gods besides God?” He will answer, “Glory be to You! How could I ever say what I had no right to say? If I had said such a thing, you would have certainly known it. You know what is ˹hidden˺ within me, but I do not know what is within You. Indeed, You ˹alone˺ are the Knower of all unseen"
  5,117,"I never told them anything except what You ordered me to say: “Worship God—my Lord and your Lord!” And I was witness over them as long as I remained among them. But when You took me, You were the Witness over them—and You are a Witness over all things"
  5,118,"If You punish them, they belong to You after all. But if You forgive them, You are surely the Almighty, All-Wise.”"
  5,119,"God will declare, “This is the Day when ˹only˺ the faithful will benefit from their faithfulness. Theirs are Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. God is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. That is the ultimate triumph.”"
  5,120,To God ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything within. And He is Most Capable of everything
