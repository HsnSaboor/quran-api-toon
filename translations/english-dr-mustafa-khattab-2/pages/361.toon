quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  25,12,"Once it sees them from a distance, they will hear it fuming and growling"
  25,13,"And when they are tossed into a narrow place inside ˹Hell˺, chained together, then and there they will cry out for ˹instant˺ destruction"
  25,14,"˹They will be told,˺ “Do not cry only once for destruction, but cry many times over!”"
  25,15,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Is this better or the Garden of Eternity which the righteous have been promised, as a reward and ˹an ultimate˺ destination"
  25,16,"There they will have whatever they wish for, forever. That is a promise ˹to be sought after˺, binding on your Lord.”"
  25,17,"˹Watch for˺ the Day He will gather them along with what they used to worship besides God, and ask ˹the objects of worship˺, “Was it you who misled these servants of Mine, or did they stray from the Way ˹on their own˺?”"
  25,18,"They will say, “Glory be to You! It was not right for ˹others like˺ us to take any lords besides You, but You allowed enjoyment for them and their forefathers ˹for so long˺ that they forgot ˹Your˺ remembrance and became a doomed people.”"
  25,19,"˹The doomed will be told˺, “Your gods have clearly denied your claims. So now you can neither ward off ˹the punishment˺ nor get any help.” And whoever of you does wrong, We will make them taste a horrible punishment"
  25,20,"We never sent any messenger before you ˹O Prophet˺, who did not eat food and go about in market-places. We have made some of you a trial for others. Will you ˹not then˺ be patient? And your Lord is All-Seeing"
