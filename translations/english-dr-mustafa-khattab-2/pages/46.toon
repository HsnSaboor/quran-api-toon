quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,270,Whatever charities you give or vows you make are surely known to God. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers
  2,271,"To give charity publicly is good, but to give to the poor privately is better for you, and will absolve you of your sins. And God is All-Aware of what you do"
  2,272,"You are not responsible for people’s guidance ˹O Prophet˺—it is God Who guides whoever He wills. Whatever you ˹believers˺ spend in charity, it is for your own good—as long as you do so seeking the pleasure of God. Whatever you donate will be paid back to you in full, and you will not be wronged"
  2,273,˹Charity is˺ for the needy who are too engaged in the cause of God to move about in the land ˹for work˺. Those unfamiliar with their situation will think they are not in need ˹of charity˺ because they do not beg. You can recognize them by their appearance. They do not beg people persistently. Whatever you give in charity is certainly well known to God
  2,274,"Those who spend their wealth in charity day and night, secretly and openly—their reward is with their Lord, and there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve"
