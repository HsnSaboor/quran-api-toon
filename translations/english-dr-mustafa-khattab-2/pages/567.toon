  69,9,"Also, Pharaoh and those before him, and ˹the people of˺ the overturned cities ˹of Lot˺ indulged in sin"
  69,10,"each disobeying their Lord’s messenger, so He seized them with a crushing grip"
  69,11,"Indeed, when the floodwater had overflowed, We carried you in the floating Ark ˹with Noah˺"
  69,12,"so that We may make this a reminder to you, and that attentive ears may grasp it"
  69,13,"At last, when the Trumpet will be blown with one blast"
  69,14,and the earth and mountains will be lifted up and crushed with one blow
  69,15,on that Day the Inevitable Event will have come to pass
  69,16,The sky will then be so torn that it will be frail
  69,17,with the angels on its sides. On that Day eight ˹mighty angels˺ will bear the Throne of your Lord above them
  69,18,"You will then be presented ˹before Him for judgment˺, and none of your secrets will stay hidden"
  69,19,"As for those given their records in their right hand, they will cry ˹happily˺, “Here ˹everyone˺! Read my record"

  69,28,My wealth has not benefited me
  69,29,My authority has been stripped from me.”
  69,30,"˹It will be said,˺ “Seize and shackle them"
  69,31,then burn them in Hell
  69,32,then tie them up with chains seventy arms long
  69,33,"For they never had faith in God, the Greatest"
  69,34,nor encouraged the feeding of the poor
