  73,1,O you wrapped ˹in your clothes˺
  73,2,Stand all night ˹in prayer˺ except a little—
  73,3,"˹pray˺ half the night, or a little less"
  73,4,or a little more—and recite the Quran ˹properly˺ in a measured way
  73,5,˹For˺ We will soon send upon you a weighty revelation
  73,6,"Indeed, worship in the night is more impactful and suitable for recitation"
  73,7,For during the day you are over-occupied ˹with worldly duties˺
  73,8,"˹Always˺ remember the Name of your Lord, and devote yourself to Him wholeheartedly"
  73,9,"˹He is the˺ Lord of the east and the west. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him, so take Him ˹alone˺ as a Trustee of Affairs"
  73,10,"Be patient ˹O Prophet˺ with what they say, and depart from them courteously"
  73,11,And leave to Me the deniers—the people of luxury—and bear with them for a little while
  73,12,"˹For˺ We certainly have shackles, a ˹raging˺ Fire"
  73,13,"choking food, and a painful punishment ˹in store for them˺"
  73,14,"on the Day the earth and mountains will shake ˹violently˺, and mountains will be ˹reduced to˺ dunes of shifting sand"
  73,15,"Indeed, We have sent to you a messenger as a witness over you, just as We sent a messenger to Pharaoh"
  73,16,"But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger, so We seized him with a stern grip"
  73,17,"If you ˹pagans˺ persist in disbelief, then how will you guard yourselves against ˹the horrors of˺ a Day which will turn children’s hair grey"
  73,18,It will ˹even˺ cause the sky to split apart. His promise ˹of judgment˺ must be fulfilled
  73,19,Surely this is a reminder. So let whoever wills take the ˹Right˺ Way to their Lord
