quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you? How do you judge
  37,155,Will you not then be mindful
  37,156,Or do you have ˹any˺ compelling proof
  37,157,"Then bring ˹us˺ your scripture, if what you say is true"
  37,158,They have also established a ˹marital˺ relationship between Him and the jinn. Yet the jinn ˹themselves˺ know well that such people will certainly be brought ˹for punishment˺
  37,159,Glorified is God far above what they claim
  37,160,But not the chosen servants of God
  37,161,Surely you ˹pagans˺ and whatever ˹idols˺ you worship
  37,162,can never lure ˹anyone˺ away from Him
  37,163,except those ˹destined˺ to burn in Hell
  37,164,"˹The angels respond,˺ “There is not one of us without an assigned station ˹of worship˺"
  37,165,We are indeed the ones lined up in ranks ˹for God˺
  37,166,And we are indeed the ones ˹constantly˺ glorifying ˹His praise˺.”
  37,167,They certainly used to say
  37,168,“If only we had a Reminder like ˹those of˺ earlier peoples
  37,169,we would have truly been God’s devoted servants.”
  37,170,"But ˹now˺ they reject it, so they will soon know"
  37,171,"Our Word has already gone forth to Our servants, the messengers"
  37,172,that they would surely be helped
  37,173,and that Our forces will certainly prevail
  37,174,So turn away from the deniers for a while ˹O Prophet˺
  37,175,"You will see ˹what will happen to˺ them, and they too will see"
  37,176,Do they ˹really˺ wish to hasten Our punishment
  37,177,"Yet when it descends upon them: how evil will that morning be for those who had been warned"
  37,178,And turn away from them for a while
  37,179,"You will see, and they too will see"
  37,180,Glorified is your Lord—the Lord of Honour and Power—above what they claim
  37,181,Peace be upon the messengers
  37,182,And praise be to God—Lord of all worlds
