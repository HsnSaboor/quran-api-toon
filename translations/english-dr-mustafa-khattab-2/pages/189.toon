quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,14,"˹So˺ fight them and God will punish them at your hands, put them to shame, help you overcome them, and soothe the hearts of the believers—"
  9,15,"removing rage from their hearts. And God pardons whoever He wills. For God is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  9,16,"Do you ˹believers˺ think that you will be left without God proving who among you ˹truly˺ struggles ˹in His cause˺ and never takes trusted allies other than God, His Messenger, or the believers? And God is All-Aware of what you do"
  9,17,"It is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of God while they openly profess disbelief. Their deeds are void, and they will be in the Fire forever"
  9,18,"The mosques of God should only be maintained by those who believe in God and the Last Day, establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and fear none but God. It is right to hope that they will be among the ˹truly˺ guided"
  9,19,Do you ˹pagans˺ consider providing the pilgrims with water and maintaining the Sacred Mosque as equal to believing in God and the Last Day and struggling in the cause of God? They are not equal in God’s sight. And God does not guide the wrongdoing people
  9,20,"Those who have believed, emigrated, and strived in the cause of God with their wealth and their lives are greater in rank in the sight of God. It is they who will triumph"
