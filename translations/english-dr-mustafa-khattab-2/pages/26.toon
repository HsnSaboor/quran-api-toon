quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,170,"When it is said to them, “Follow what God has revealed,” they reply, “No! We ˹only˺ follow what we found our forefathers practicing.” ˹Would they still do so,˺ even if their forefathers had ˹absolutely˺ no understanding or guidance"
  2,171,"The example of the disbelievers ˹not responding to the Messenger’s warning˺ is like a flock not comprehending the calls and cries of the shepherd. ˹They are wilfully˺ deaf, dumb and blind so they have no understanding"
  2,172,O believers! Eat from the good things We have provided for you. And give thanks to God if you ˹truly˺ worship Him ˹alone˺
  2,173,"He has only forbidden you ˹to eat˺ carrion, blood, swine, and what is slaughtered in the name of any other than God. But if someone is compelled by necessity—neither driven by desire nor exceeding immediate need—they will not be sinful. Surely God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  2,174,"Indeed, those who hide God’s revelations, trading them for a fleeting gain consume nothing but fire into their bellies. God will neither speak to them on the Day of Judgment, nor will He purify them. And they will suffer a painful punishment"
  2,175,They are the ones who trade guidance for misguidance and forgiveness for punishment. How persistent are they in pursuit of the Fire
  2,176,That is because God has revealed the Book in truth. And surely those who differ regarding it are totally engrossed in opposition
