quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,102,"That is God—your Lord! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. ˹He is˺ the Creator of all things, so worship Him ˹alone˺. And He is the Maintainer of everything"
  6,103,"No vision can encompass Him, but He encompasses all vision. For He is the Most Subtle, All-Aware"
  6,104,"Indeed, there have come to you insights from your Lord. So whoever chooses to see, it is for their own good. But whoever chooses to be blind, it is to their own loss. And I am not a keeper over you"
  6,105,"And so We vary our signs to the extent that they will say, “You have studied ˹previous scriptures˺,” and We make this ˹Quran˺ clear for people who know"
  6,106,˹O Prophet!˺ Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord—there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him—and turn away from the polytheists
  6,107,"Had God willed, they would not have been polytheists. We have not appointed you as their keeper, nor are you their maintainer"
  6,108,"˹O believers!˺ Do not insult what they invoke besides God or they will insult God spitefully out of ignorance. This is how We have made each people’s deeds appealing to them. Then to their Lord is their return, and He will inform them of what they used to do"
  6,109,"They swear by God their most solemn oaths that if a sign were to come to them, they would certainly believe in it. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Signs are only with God.” What will make you ˹believers˺ realize that even if a sign were to come to them, they still would not believe"
  6,110,"We turn their hearts and eyes away ˹from the truth˺ as they refused to believe at first, leaving them to wander blindly in their defiance"
