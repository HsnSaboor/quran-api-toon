quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,89,"Although they used to pray for victory ˹by means of the Prophet˺ over the polytheists, when there came to them a Book from God which they recognized, confirming the Scripture they had ˹in their hands˺, they rejected it. So may God’s condemnation be upon the disbelievers"
  2,90,Miserable is the price they have sold their souls for—denying God’s revelation and resenting God for granting His grace to whoever He wills of His servants! They have earned wrath upon wrath. And such disbelievers will suffer a humiliating punishment
  2,91,"When it is said to them: “Believe in what God has revealed,” they reply, “We only believe in what was sent down to us,” and they deny what came afterwards, though it is the truth confirming their own Scriptures! Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Why then did you kill God’s prophets before, if you are ˹truly˺ believers?”"
  2,92,"Indeed, Moses came to you with clear proofs, then you worshipped the calf in his absence, acting wrongfully"
  2,93,"And when We took your covenant and raised the mountain above you ˹saying˺, “Hold firmly to that ˹Scripture˺ which We have given you and obey,” they answered, “We hear and disobey.” The love of the calf was rooted in their hearts because of their disbelief. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “How evil is what your ˹so-called˺ belief prompts you to do, if you ˹actually˺ believe ˹in the Torah˺!”"
