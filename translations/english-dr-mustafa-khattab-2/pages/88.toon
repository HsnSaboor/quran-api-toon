quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,60,"Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who claim they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you? They seek the judgment of false judges, which they were commanded to reject. And Satan ˹only˺ desires to lead them farther away"
  4,61,"When it is said to them, “Come to God’s revelations and to the Messenger,” you see the hypocrites turn away from you stubbornly"
  4,62,"How ˹horrible˺ will it be if a disaster strikes them because of what their hands have done, then they come to you swearing by God, “We intended nothing but goodwill and reconciliation.”"
  4,63,"˹Only˺ God knows what is in their hearts. So turn away from them, caution them, and give them advice that will shake their very souls"
  4,64,"We only sent messengers to be obeyed by God’s Will. If only those ˹hypocrites˺ came to you ˹O Prophet˺—after wronging themselves—seeking God’s forgiveness and the Messenger prayed for their forgiveness, they would have certainly found God ever Accepting of Repentance, Most Merciful"
  4,65,"But no! By your Lord, they will never be ˹true˺ believers until they accept you ˹O Prophet˺ as the judge in their disputes, and find no resistance within themselves against your decision and submit wholeheartedly"
