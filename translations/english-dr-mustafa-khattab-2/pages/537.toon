quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,that this is truly a noble Quran
  56,78,in a well-preserved Record
  56,79,touched by none except the purified ˹angels˺
  56,80,˹It is˺ a revelation from the Lord of all worlds
  56,81,How can you then take this message lightly
  56,82,and repay ˹God for˺ your provisions with denial
  56,83,Why then ˹are you helpless˺ when the soul ˹of a dying person˺ reaches ˹their˺ throat
  56,84,while you are looking on
  56,85,"And We are nearer to such a person than you, but you cannot see"
  56,86,"Now, if you are not subject to Our Will ˹as you claim˺"
  56,87,"bring that soul back, if what you say is true"
  56,88,"So, if the deceased is one of those brought near ˹to Us˺"
  56,89,"then ˹such a person will have˺ serenity, fragrance, and a Garden of Bliss"
  56,90,And if the deceased is one of the people of the right
  56,91,"then ˹they will be told,˺ “Greetings to you from the people of the right.”"
  56,92,But if such person is one of the misguided deniers
  56,93,then their accommodation will be boiling water ˹to drink˺
  56,94,and burning in Hellfire
  56,95,"Indeed, this is the absolute truth"
  56,96,"So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Greatest"
  57,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glorifies God, for He is the Almighty, All-Wise"
  57,2,To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death. And He is Most Capable of everything
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last, the Most High and Most Near, and He has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things"
