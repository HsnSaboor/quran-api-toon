quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,135,"O believers! Stand firm for justice as witnesses for God even if it is against yourselves, your parents, or close relatives. Be they rich or poor, God is best to ensure their interests. So do not let your desires cause you to deviate ˹from justice˺. If you distort the testimony or refuse to give it, then ˹know that˺ God is certainly All-Aware of what you do"
  4,136,"O believers! Have faith in God, His Messenger, the Book He has revealed to His Messenger, and the Scriptures He revealed before. Indeed, whoever denies God, His angels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last Day has clearly gone far astray"
  4,137,"Indeed, those who believed then disbelieved, then believed and again disbelieved—˹only˺ increasing in disbelief—God will neither forgive them nor guide them to the ˹Right˺ Way"
  4,138,Give good news of a painful punishment to hypocrites
  4,139,who choose disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Do they seek honour and power through that company? Surely all honour and power belongs to God
  4,140,"He has already revealed to you in the Book that when you hear God’s revelations being denied or ridiculed, then do not sit in that company unless they engage in a different topic, or else you will be like them. Surely God will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell"
