quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  36,13,"Give them an example ˹O Prophet˺ of the residents of a town, when the messengers came to them"
  36,14,"We sent them two messengers, but they rejected both. So We reinforced ˹the two˺ with a third, and they declared, “We have indeed been sent to you ˹as messengers˺.”"
  36,15,"The people replied, “You are only humans like us, and the Most Compassionate has not revealed anything. You are simply lying!”"
  36,16,"The messengers responded, “Our Lord knows that we have truly been sent to you"
  36,17,And our duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly.”
  36,18,"The people replied, “We definitely see you as a bad omen for us. If you do not desist, we will certainly stone you ˹to death˺ and you will be touched with a painful punishment from us.”"
  36,19,"The messengers said, “Your bad omen lies within yourselves. Are you saying this because you are reminded ˹of the truth˺? In fact, you are a transgressing people.”"
  36,20,"Then from the farthest end of the city a man came, rushing. He advised, “O my people! Follow the messengers"
  36,21,"Follow those who ask no reward of you, and are ˹rightly˺ guided"
  36,22,"And why should I not worship the One Who has originated me, and to Whom you will be returned"
  36,23,"How could I take besides Him other gods whose intercession would not be of any benefit to me, nor could they save me if the Most Compassionate intended to harm me"
  36,24,"Indeed, I would then be clearly astray"
  36,25,"I do believe in your Lord, so listen to me.”"
  36,26,"˹But they killed him, then˺ he was told ˹by the angels˺, “Enter Paradise!” He said, “If only my people knew"
  36,27,"of how my Lord has forgiven me, and made me one of the honourable.”"
