quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  89,24,"They will cry, “I wish I had sent forth ˹something good˺ for my ˹true˺ life.”"
  89,25,"On that Day He will punish ˹them˺ severely, like no other"
  89,26,"and bind ˹them˺ tightly, like no other"
  89,27,"˹God will say to the righteous,˺ “O tranquil soul"
  89,28,"Return to your Lord, well pleased ˹with Him˺ and well pleasing ˹to Him˺"
  89,29,So join My servants
  89,30,and enter My Paradise.”
  90,1,I do swear by this city ˹of Mecca˺—
  90,2,even though you ˹O Prophet˺ are subject to abuse in this city—
  90,3,and by every parent and ˹their˺ child
  90,4,"Indeed, We have created humankind in ˹constant˺ struggle"
  90,5,Do they think that no one has power over them
  90,6,"boasting, “I have wasted enormous wealth!”"
  90,7,Do they think that no one sees them
  90,8,Have We not given them two eyes
  90,9,"a tongue, and two lips"
  90,10,and shown them the two ways ˹of right and wrong˺
  90,11,If only they had attempted the challenging path ˹of goodness instead˺
  90,12,And what will make you realize what ˹attempting˺ the challenging path is
  90,13,It is to free a slave
  90,14,or to give food in times of famine
  90,15,to an orphaned relative
  90,16,or to a poor person in distress
  90,17,and—above all—to be one of those who have faith and urge each other to perseverance and urge each other to compassion
  90,18,These are the people of the right
  90,19,"As for those who deny Our signs, they are the people of the left"
  90,20,The Fire will be sealed over them
