quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"who used to ask ˹me˺, ‘Do you actually believe ˹in resurrection˺"
  37,53,"When we are dead and reduced to dust and bones, will we really be brought to judgment?’”"
  37,54,"He will ˹then˺ ask, “Would you care to see ˹his fate˺?”"
  37,55,Then he ˹and the others˺ will look and spot him in the midst of the Hellfire
  37,56,"He will ˹then˺ say, “By God! You nearly ruined me"
  37,57,"Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I ˹too˺ would have certainly been among those brought ˹to Hell˺.”"
  37,58,"˹Then he will ask his fellow believers,˺ “Can you imagine that we will never die"
  37,59,"except our first death, nor be punished ˹like the others˺?”"
  37,60,This is truly the ultimate triumph
  37,61,For such ˹honour˺ all should strive
  37,62,Is this ˹bliss˺ a better accommodation or the tree of Zaqqûm
  37,63,We have surely made it a test for the wrongdoers
  37,64,"Indeed, it is a tree that grows in the depths of Hell"
  37,65,bearing fruit like devils’ heads
  37,66,"The evildoers will certainly ˹be left to˺ eat from it, filling up their bellies with it"
  37,67,Then on top of that they will be given a blend of boiling drink
  37,68,Then they will ultimately return to ˹their place in˺ Hell
  37,69,"Indeed, they found their forefathers astray"
  37,70,so they rushed in their footsteps
  37,71,And surely most of the earlier generations had strayed before them
  37,72,although We had certainly sent warners among them
  37,73,See then what was the end of those who had been warned
  37,74,But not the chosen servants of God
  37,75,"Indeed, Noah cried out to Us, and how excellent are We in responding"
  37,76,We delivered him and his family from the great distress
