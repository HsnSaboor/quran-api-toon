quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  32,12,"If only you could see the wicked hanging their heads ˹in shame˺ before their Lord, ˹crying:˺ “Our Lord! We have now seen and heard, so send us back and we will do good. We truly have sure faith ˹now˺!”"
  32,13,"Had We willed, We could have easily imposed guidance on every soul. But My Word will come to pass: I will surely fill up Hell with jinn and humans all together"
  32,14,So taste ˹the punishment˺ for neglecting the meeting of this Day of yours. We ˹too˺ will certainly neglect you. And taste the torment of eternity for what you used to do
  32,15,The only ˹true˺ believers in Our revelation are those who—when it is recited to them—fall into prostration and glorify the praises of their Lord and are not too proud
  32,16,"They abandon their beds, invoking their Lord with hope and fear, and donate from what We have provided for them"
  32,17,No soul can imagine what delights are kept in store for them as a reward for what they used to do
  32,18,Is the one who is a believer equal ˹before God˺ to the one who is rebellious? They are not equal
  32,19,"As for those who believe and do good, they will have the Gardens of ˹Eternal˺ Residence—as an accommodation for what they used to do"
  32,20,"But as for those who are rebellious, the Fire will be their home. Whenever they try to escape from it, they will be forced back into it, and will be told, “Taste the Fire’s torment, which you used to deny.”"
