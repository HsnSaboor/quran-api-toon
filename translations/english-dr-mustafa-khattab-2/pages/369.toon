quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,40,so that we may follow the magicians if they prevail?”
  26,41,"When the magicians came, they asked Pharaoh, “Shall we have a ˹suitable˺ reward if we prevail?”"
  26,42,"He replied, “Yes, and you will then certainly be among those closest to me.”"
  26,43,"Moses said to them, “Cast whatever you wish to cast.”"
  26,44,"So they cast down their ropes and staffs, saying, “By Pharaoh’s might, it is we who will surely prevail.”"
  26,45,"Then Moses threw down his staff, and—behold!—it devoured the objects of their illusion"
  26,46,"So the magicians fell down, prostrating"
  26,47,"They declared, “We ˹now˺ believe in the Lord of all worlds—"
  26,48,the Lord of Moses and Aaron.”
  26,49,"Pharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission? He must be your master who taught you magic, but soon you will see. I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then crucify you all.”"
  26,50,"They responded, “˹That would be˺ no harm! Surely to our Lord we will ˹all˺ return"
  26,51,"We really hope that our Lord will forgive our sins, as we are the first to believe.”"
  26,52,"And We inspired Moses, ˹saying,˺ “Leave with My servants at night, for you will surely be pursued.”"
  26,53,Then Pharaoh sent mobilizers to all cities
  26,54,"˹and said,˺ “These ˹outcasts˺ are just a handful of people"
  26,55,who have really enraged us
  26,56,but we are all on the alert.”
  26,57,"So We lured the tyrants out of ˹their˺ gardens, springs"
  26,58,"treasures, and splendid residences"
  26,59,So it was. And We awarded it ˹all˺ to the Children of Israel
  26,60,And so they pursued them at sunrise
