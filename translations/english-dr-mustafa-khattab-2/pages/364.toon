quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,44,"Or do you think that most of them listen or understand? They are only like cattle—no, more than that, they are astray from the ˹Right˺ Way"
  25,45,Have you not seen how your Lord extends the shade—He could have simply made it ˹remain˺ still if He so willed—then We make the sun its guide
  25,46,causing the shade to retreat gradually
  25,47,"He is the One Who has made the night for you as a cover, and ˹made˺ sleep for resting, and the day for rising"
  25,48,"And He is the One Who sends the winds ushering in His mercy, and We send down pure rain from the sky"
  25,49,"giving life to a lifeless land, and providing water for countless animals and humans of Our Own creation"
  25,50,"We certainly disperse it among them so they may be mindful, but most people persist in ungratefulness"
  25,51,"Had We willed, We could have easily sent a warner to every society"
  25,52,"So do not yield to the disbelievers, but strive diligently against them with this ˹Quran˺"
  25,53,"And He is the One Who merges the two bodies of water: one fresh and palatable and the other salty and bitter, placing between them a barrier they cannot cross"
  25,54,"And He is the One Who creates human beings from a ˹humble˺ liquid, then establishes for them bonds of kinship and marriage. For your Lord is Most Capable"
  25,55,Yet they worship besides God what can neither benefit nor harm them. And the disbeliever always collaborates against their Lord
