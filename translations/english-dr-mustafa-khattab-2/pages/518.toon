quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  50,1,Qãf. By the glorious Quran
  50,2,"˹All will be resurrected,˺ yet the deniers are astonished that a warner has come to them from among themselves ˹warning of resurrection˺. So the disbelievers say, “This is an astonishing thing"
  50,3,"˹Will we be returned to life,˺ when we are dead and reduced to dust? Such a return is impossible.”"
  50,4,"We certainly know what the earth consumes of them ˹after their death˺, and with us is a well-preserved Record"
  50,5,"In fact, they reject the truth when it has come to them, so they are in a confused state"
  50,6,"Have they not then looked at the sky above them: how We built it and adorned it ˹with stars˺, leaving it flawless"
  50,7,"As for the earth, We spread it out and placed upon it firm mountains, and produced in it every type of pleasant plant—"
  50,8,˹all as˺ an insight and a reminder to every servant who turns ˹to God˺
  50,9,"And We send down blessed rain from the sky, bringing forth gardens and grains for harvest"
  50,10,and towering palm trees ˹loaded˺ with clustered fruit
  50,11,˹as˺ a provision for ˹Our˺ servants. And with this ˹rain˺ We revive a lifeless land. Similar is the emergence ˹from the graves˺
  50,12,"Before them, the people of Noah denied ˹the truth,˺ as did the people of the Water-pit, Thamûd"
  50,13,"’Ȃd, Pharaoh, the kinfolk of Lot"
  50,14,"the residents of the Forest, and the people of Tubba’. Each rejected ˹their˺ messenger, so My warning was fulfilled"
  50,15,"Were We incapable of creating ˹them˺ the first time? In fact, they are in doubt about ˹their˺ re-creation"
