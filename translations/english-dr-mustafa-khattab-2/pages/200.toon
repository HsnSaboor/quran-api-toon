quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,80,"˹It does not matter˺ whether you ˹O Prophet˺ pray for them to be forgiven or not. Even if you pray for their forgiveness seventy times, God will never forgive them. That is because they have lost faith in God and His Messenger. And God does not guide the rebellious people"
  9,81,"Those ˹hypocrites˺ who remained behind rejoiced for doing so in defiance of the Messenger of God and hated ˹the prospect of˺ striving with their wealth and their lives in the cause of God. They said ˹to one another˺, “Do not march forth in the heat.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “The Fire of Hell is far hotter!” If only they could comprehend"
  9,82,So let them laugh a little—they will weep much as a reward for what they have committed
  9,83,"If God returns you ˹O Prophet˺ to a group of them and they ask to go forth with you, say, “You will not ever go forth or fight an enemy along with me. You preferred to stay behind the first time, so stay with those ˹helpless˺ who remain behind.”"
  9,84,"And do not ever offer ˹funeral˺ prayers for any of their dead, nor stand by their grave ˹at burial˺, for they have lost faith in God and His Messenger and died rebellious"
  9,85,"And let neither their wealth nor children impress you ˹O Prophet˺. God only intends to torment them through these things in this world, and ˹then˺ their souls will depart while they are disbelievers"
  9,86,"Whenever a sûrah is revealed stating, “Believe in God and struggle along with His Messenger,” the rich among them would ask to be exempt, saying, “Leave us with those who remain behind.”"
