quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,71,"Relate to them ˹O Prophet˺ the story of Noah when he said to his people, “O my People! If my presence and my reminders to you of God’s signs are unbearable to you, then ˹know that˺ I have put my trust in God. So devise a plot along with your associate-gods—and you do not have to be secretive about your plot—then carry it out against me without delay"
  10,72,"And if you turn away, ˹remember˺ I have never demanded a reward from you ˹for delivering the message˺. My reward is only from God. And I have been commanded to be one of those who submit ˹to God˺.”"
  10,73,"But they still rejected him, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark and made them successors, and drowned those who rejected Our signs. See then what was the end of those who had been warned"
  10,74,Then after him We sent ˹other˺ messengers to their ˹own˺ people and they came to them with clear proofs. But they would not believe in what they had rejected before. This is how We seal the hearts of the transgressors
  10,75,Then after these ˹messengers˺ We sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our signs. But they behaved arrogantly and were a wicked people
  10,76,"When the truth came to them from Us, they said, “This is certainly pure magic!”"
  10,77,"Moses responded, “Is this what you say about the truth when it has come to you? Is this magic? Magicians will never succeed.”"
  10,78,"They argued, “Have you come to turn us away from the faith of our forefathers so that the two of you may become supreme in the land? We will never believe in you!”"
