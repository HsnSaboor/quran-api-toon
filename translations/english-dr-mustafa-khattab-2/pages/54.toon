quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,30,˹Watch for˺ the Day when every soul will be presented with whatever good it has done. And it will wish that its misdeeds were far off. And God warns you about Himself. And God is Ever Gracious to ˹His˺ servants
  3,31,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If you ˹sincerely˺ love God, then follow me; God will love you and forgive your sins. For God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”"
  3,32,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Obey God and His Messenger.” If they still turn away, then truly God does not like the disbelievers"
  3,33,"Indeed, God chose Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of ’Imrân above all people ˹of their time˺"
  3,34,"They are descendants of one another. And God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
  3,35,"˹Remember˺ when the wife of ’Imrân said, “My Lord! I dedicate what is in my womb entirely to Your service, so accept it from me. You ˹alone˺ are truly the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.”"
  3,36,"When she delivered, she said, “My Lord! I have given birth to a girl,”—and God fully knew what she had delivered—“and the male is not like the female. I have named her Mary, and I seek Your protection for her and her offspring from Satan, the accursed.”"
  3,37,"So her Lord accepted her graciously and blessed her with a pleasant upbringing—entrusting her to the care of Zachariah. Whenever Zachariah visited her in the sanctuary, he found her supplied with provisions. He exclaimed, “O Mary! Where did this come from?” She replied, “It is from God. Surely God provides for whoever He wills without limit.”"
