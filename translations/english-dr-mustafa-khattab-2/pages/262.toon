quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  15,1,Alif-Lãm-Ra. These are the verses of the Book; the clear Quran
  15,2,˹The day will come when˺ the disbelievers will certainly wish they had submitted ˹to God˺
  15,3,"˹So˺ let them eat and enjoy themselves and be diverted by ˹false˺ hope, for they will soon know"
  15,4,We have never destroyed a society without a destined term
  15,5,"No people can advance their doom, nor can they delay it"
  15,6,"They say, “O you to whom the Reminder is revealed! You must be insane"
  15,7,"Why do you not bring us the angels, if what you say is true?”"
  15,8,"We do not send the angels down except for a just cause, and then ˹the end of˺ the disbelievers will not be delayed"
  15,9,"It is certainly We Who have revealed the Reminder, and it is certainly We Who will preserve it"
  15,10,"Indeed, We sent messengers before you ˹O Prophet˺ among the groups of early peoples"
  15,11,but no messenger ever came to them without being mocked
  15,12,This is how We allow disbelief ˹to steep˺ into the hearts of the wicked
  15,13,They would not believe in this ˹Quran˺ despite the ˹many˺ examples of those ˹destroyed˺ before
  15,14,"And even if We opened for them a gate to heaven, through which they continued to ascend"
  15,15,"still they would say, “Our eyes have truly been dazzled! In fact, we must have been bewitched.”"
