quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  25,3,"Yet they have taken besides Him gods who cannot create anything but are themselves created. Nor can they protect or benefit themselves. Nor can they control life, death, or resurrection"
  25,4,"The disbelievers say, “This ˹Quran˺ is nothing but a fabrication which he made up with the help of others.” Their claim is totally unjustified and untrue"
  25,5,"And they say, “˹These revelations are only˺ ancient fables which he has had written down, and they are rehearsed to him morning and evening.”"
  25,6,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “This ˹Quran˺ has been revealed by the One Who knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth. Surely He is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”"
  25,7,"And they say ˹mockingly˺, “What kind of messenger is this who eats food and goes about in market-places ˹for a living˺? If only an angel had been sent down with him to be his co-warner"
  25,8,"or a treasure had been cast down to him, or he had had a garden from which he may eat!” And the wrongdoers say ˹to the believers˺, “You are only following a bewitched man.”"
  25,9,See ˹O Prophet˺ how they call you names! So they have gone so ˹far˺ astray that they cannot find the ˹Right˺ Way

  25,11,"In fact, they deny the Hour. And for the deniers of the Hour, We have prepared a blazing Fire"
