quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,56,And We have sent you ˹O Prophet˺ only as a deliverer of good news and a warner
  25,57,"Say, “I do not ask you for any reward for this ˹message˺, but whoever wishes, let them pursue the Way to their Lord.”"
  25,58,"Put your trust in the Ever-Living, Who never dies, and glorify His praises. Sufficient is He as All-Aware of the sins of His servants"
  25,59,"˹He is˺ the One Who created the heavens and the earth and everything in between in six Days, then established Himself on the Throne. ˹He is˺ the Most Compassionate! Ask ˹none other than˺ the All-Knowledgeable about Himself"
  25,60,"When it is said to them, “Prostrate to the Most Compassionate,” they ask ˹in disgust˺, “What is ‘the Most Compassionate’? Will we prostrate to whatever you order us to?” And it only drives them farther away"
  25,61,"Blessed is the One Who has placed constellations in the sky, as well as a ˹radiant˺ lamp and a luminous moon"
  25,62,"And He is the One Who causes the day and the night to alternate, ˹as a sign˺ for whoever desires to be mindful or to be grateful"
  25,63,"The ˹true˺ servants of the Most Compassionate are those who walk on the earth humbly, and when the foolish address them ˹improperly˺, they only respond with peace"
  25,64,"˹They are˺ those who spend ˹a good portion of˺ the night, prostrating themselves and standing before their Lord"
  25,65,"˹They are˺ those who pray, “Our Lord! Keep the punishment of Hell away from us, for its punishment is indeed unrelenting"
  25,66,It is certainly an evil place to settle and reside.”
  25,67,"˹They are˺ those who spend neither wastefully nor stingily, but moderately in between"
