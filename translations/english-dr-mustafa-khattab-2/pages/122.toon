quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"When they listen to what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears for recognizing the truth. They say, “Our Lord! We believe, so count us among the witnesses"
  5,84,Why should we not believe in God and the truth that has come to us? And we long for our Lord to include us in the company of the righteous.”
  5,85,"So God will reward them for what they said with Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever. And that is the reward of the good-doers"
  5,86,"As for those who disbelieve and reject Our signs, they will be the residents of the Hellfire"
  5,87,"O believers! Do not forbid the good things which God has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Indeed, God does not like transgressors"
  5,88,"Eat of the good, lawful things provided to you by God. And be mindful of God in Whom you believe"
  5,89,"God will not call you to account for your thoughtless oaths, but He will hold you accountable for deliberate oaths. The penalty for a broken oath is to feed ten poor people from what you normally feed your own family, or to clothe them, or to free a bondsperson. But if none of this is affordable, then you must fast three days. This is the penalty for breaking your oaths. So be mindful of your oaths. This is how God makes things clear to you, so perhaps you will be grateful"
