quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,43,"No people can advance their doom, nor can they delay it"
  23,44,"Then We sent Our messengers in succession: whenever a messenger came to his people, they denied him. So We destroyed them, one after the other, reducing them to ˹cautionary˺ tales. So away with the people who refuse to believe"
  23,45,Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and compelling proof
  23,46,"to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they behaved arrogantly and were a tyrannical people"
  23,47,"They argued, “Will we believe in two humans, like ourselves, whose people are slaves to us?”"
  23,48,"So they rejected them both, and ˹so˺ were among those destroyed"
  23,49,"And We certainly gave Moses the Scripture, so perhaps his people would be ˹rightly˺ guided"
  23,50,"And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and gave them refuge on high ground—a ˹suitable˺ place for rest with flowing water"
  23,51,"O messengers! Eat from what is good and lawful, and act righteously. Indeed, I fully know what you do"
  23,52,"Surely this religion of yours is ˹only˺ one, and I am your Lord, so fear Me ˹alone˺"
  23,53,"Yet the people have divided it into different sects, each rejoicing in what they have"
  23,54,So leave them ˹O Prophet˺ in their heedlessness for a while
  23,55,"Do they think, since We provide them with wealth and children"
  23,56,that We hasten to ˹honour˺ them ˹with˺ all kinds of good? No! They are not aware
  23,57,Surely those who tremble in awe of their Lord
  23,58,and who believe in the revelations of their Lord
  23,59,and who associate none with their Lord
