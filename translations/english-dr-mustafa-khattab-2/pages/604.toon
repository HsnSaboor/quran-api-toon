  113,2,from the evil of whatever He has created
  113,3,and from the evil of the night when it grows dark
  113,4,and from the evil of those ˹witches casting spells by˺ blowing onto knots
  113,5,and from the evil of an envier when they envy.”
  114,1,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I seek refuge in the Lord of humankind"

  114,5,who whispers into the hearts of humankind—
  114,6,from among jinn and humankind.”
