quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  7,179,"Indeed, We have destined many jinn and humans for Hell. They have hearts they do not understand with, eyes they do not see with, and ears they do not hear with. They are like cattle. In fact, they are even less guided! Such ˹people˺ are ˹entirely˺ heedless"
  7,180,"God has the Most Beautiful Names. So call upon Him by them, and keep away from those who abuse His Names. They will be punished for what they used to do"
  7,181,And among those We created is a group that guides with the truth and establishes justice accordingly
  7,182,"As for those who deny Our signs, We will gradually draw them to destruction in ways they cannot comprehend"
  7,183,"I ˹only˺ delay their end for a while, but My planning is flawless"
  7,184,Have they not ever given it a thought? Their fellow man is not insane. He is only sent with a clear warning
  7,185,"Have they ever reflected on the wonders of the heavens and the earth, and everything God has created, and that perhaps their end is near? So what message after this ˹Quran˺ would they believe in"
  7,186,"Whoever God allows to stray, none can guide, leaving them to wander blindly in their defiance"
  7,187,"They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the Hour, “When will it be?” Say, “That knowledge is only with my Lord. He alone will reveal it when the time comes. It is too tremendous for the heavens and the earth and will only take you by surprise.” They ask you as if you had full knowledge of it. Say, “That knowledge is only with God, but most people do not know.”"
