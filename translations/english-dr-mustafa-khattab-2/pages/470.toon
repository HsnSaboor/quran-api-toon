quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,26,"And Pharaoh said, “Let me kill Moses, and let him call upon his Lord! I truly fear that he may change your traditions or cause mischief in the land.”"
  40,27,"Moses replied, “I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant person who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning.”"
  40,28,"A believing man from Pharaoh’s people, who was hiding his faith, argued, “Will you kill a man ˹only˺ for saying: ‘My Lord is God,’ while he has in fact come to you with clear proofs from your Lord? If he is a liar, it will be to his own loss. But if he is truthful, then you will be afflicted with some of what he is threatening you with. Surely God does not guide whoever is a transgressor, a total liar"
  40,29,"O my people! Authority belongs to you today, reigning supreme in the land. But who would help us against the torment of God, if it were to befall us?” Pharaoh assured ˹his people˺, “I am telling you only what I believe, and I am leading you only to the way of guidance.”"
  40,30,"And the man who believed cautioned, “O my people! I truly fear for you the doom of ˹earlier˺ enemy forces—"
  40,31,"like the fate of the people of Noah, ’Ȃd, Thamûd, and those after them. For God would never will to wrong ˹His˺ servants"
  40,32,O my people! I truly fear for you the Day all will be crying out ˹to each other˺—
  40,33,"the Day you will ˹try in vain to˺ turn your backs and run away, with no one to protect you from God. And whoever God leaves to stray will be left with no guide"
