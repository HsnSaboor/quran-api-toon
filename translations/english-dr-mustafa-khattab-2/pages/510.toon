quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  47,30,"Had We willed, We could have truly shown them to you ˹O Prophet˺, and you would have certainly recognized them by their appearance. But you will surely recognize them by their tone of speech. And God ˹fully˺ knows your doings ˹O people˺"
  47,31,"We will certainly test you ˹believers˺ until We prove those of you who ˹truly˺ struggle ˹in God’s cause˺ and remain steadfast, and reveal how you conduct yourselves"
  47,32,"Indeed, those who disbelieve, hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of God, and defy the Messenger after ˹true˺ guidance has become clear to them; they will not harm God in the least, but He will render their deeds void"
  47,33,"O believers! Obey God and obey the Messenger, and do not let your deeds be in vain"
  47,34,"Surely those who disbelieve, hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of God, and then die as disbelievers; God will never forgive them"
  47,35,"So do not falter or cry for peace, for you will have the upper hand and God is with you. And He will never let your deeds go to waste"
  47,36,"This worldly life is no more than play and amusement. But if you are faithful and mindful ˹of God˺, He will grant you your ˹full˺ reward, and will not ask you ˹to donate all˺ your wealth"
  47,37,"If He were to do so and pressure you, you would withhold and He would bring out your resentment"
  47,38,"Here you are, being invited to donate ˹a little˺ in the cause of God. Still some of you withhold. And whoever does so, it is only to their own loss. For God is the Self-Sufficient, whereas you stand in need ˹of Him˺. If you ˹still˺ turn away, He will replace you with another people. And they will not be like you"
