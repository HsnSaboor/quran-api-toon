quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,18,"The Jews and the Christians each say, “We are the children of God and His most beloved!” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Why then does He punish you for your sins? No! You are only humans like others of His Own making. He forgives whoever He wills and punishes whoever He wills. To God ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. And to Him is the final return.”"
  5,19,"O People of the Book! Our Messenger has indeed come to you, making things clear to you after an interval between the messengers so you do not say, “There has never come to us a deliverer of good news or a warner.” Now there has come to you a deliverer of good news and a warner. And God is Most Capable of everything"
  5,20,"And ˹remember˺ when Moses said to his people, “O my people! Remember God’s favours upon you when He raised prophets from among you, made you sovereign, and gave you what He had never given anyone in the world"
  5,21,O my people! Enter the Holy Land which God has destined for you ˹to enter˺. And do not turn back or else you will become losers.”
  5,22,"They replied, “O Moses! There is an enormously powerful people there, so we will never ˹be able to˺ enter it until they leave. If they do, then we will enter!”"
  5,23,"Two God-fearing men—who had been blessed by God—said, “Surprise them through the gate. If you do, you will certainly prevail. Put your trust in God if you are ˹truly˺ believers.”"
