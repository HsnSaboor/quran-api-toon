quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,21,"Those who do not expect to meet Us say, “If only the angels were sent down to us, or we could see our Lord!” They have certainly been carried away by their arrogance and have entirely exceeded all limits"
  25,22,"˹But˺ on the Day they will see the angels, there will be no good news for the wicked, who will cry, “Keep away! Away ˹from us˺!”"
  25,23,"Then We will turn to whatever ˹good˺ deeds they did, reducing them to scattered dust"
  25,24,˹But˺ on that Day the residents of Paradise will have the best settlement and the finest place to rest
  25,25,"˹Watch for˺ the Day the heavens will burst with clouds, and the angels will be sent down in successive ranks"
  25,26,True authority on that Day will belong ˹only˺ to the Most Compassionate. And it will be a hard day for the disbelievers
  25,27,"And ˹beware of˺ the Day the wrongdoer will bite his nails ˹in regret˺ and say, “Oh! I wish I had followed the Way along with the Messenger"
  25,28,Woe to me! I wish I had never taken so-and-so as a close friend
  25,29,It was he who truly made me stray from the Reminder after it had reached me.” And Satan has always betrayed humanity
  25,30,"The Messenger has cried, “O my Lord! My people have indeed received this Quran with neglect.”"
  25,31,"Similarly, We made enemies for every prophet from among the wicked, but sufficient is your Lord as a Guide and Helper"
  25,32,"The disbelievers say, “If only the Quran had been sent down to him all at once!” ˹We have sent it˺ as such ˹in stages˺ so We may reassure your heart with it. And We have revealed it at a deliberate pace"
