  29,24,"But the only response of Abraham’s people was to say: “Kill him or burn him!” But God saved him from the fire. Surely in this are signs for people who believe"
  29,25,"He said ˹to his people˺, “You have taken idols ˹for worship˺ instead of God, only to keep ˹the bond of˺ harmony among yourselves in this worldly life. But on the Day of Judgment you will disown and curse one another. Your home will be the Fire, and you will have no helper!”"
  29,26,"So Lot believed in him. And Abraham said, “I am emigrating ˹in obedience˺ to my Lord. He ˹alone˺ is indeed the Almighty, All-Wise.”"
  29,27,"We blessed him with Isaac and ˹later˺ Jacob, and reserved prophethood and revelation for his descendants. We gave him his reward in this life, and in the Hereafter he will certainly be among the righteous"
  29,28,"And ˹remember˺ when Lot rebuked ˹the men of˺ his people: “You certainly commit a shameful deed that no man has ever done before you"
  29,29,"Do you really lust after ˹other˺ men, abuse the travellers, and practice immorality ˹openly˺ in your gatherings?” His people’s only response was to say ˹mockingly˺: “Bring God’s punishment upon us, if what you say is true.”"
  29,30,"Lot prayed, “My Lord! Help me against the people of corruption.”"
