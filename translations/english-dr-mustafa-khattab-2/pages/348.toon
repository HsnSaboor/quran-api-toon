quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,90,"In fact, We have brought them the truth, and they are certainly liars"
  23,91,"God has never had ˹any˺ offspring, nor is there any god besides Him. Otherwise, each god would have taken away what he created, and they would have tried to dominate one another. Glorified is God above what they claim"
  23,92,˹He is the˺ Knower of the seen and unseen. Exalted is He above what they associate ˹with Him˺
  23,93,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord! Should You show me what they are threatened with"
  23,94,"then, my Lord, do not count me among the wrongdoing people.”"
  23,95,We are indeed able to show you what We have threatened them with
  23,96,Respond to evil with what is best. We know well what they claim
  23,97,"And say, “My Lord! I seek refuge in You from the temptations of the devils"
  23,98,"And I seek refuge in You, my Lord, that they ˹even˺ come near me.”"
  23,99,"When death approaches any of them, they cry, “My Lord! Let me go back"
  23,100,so I may do good in what I left behind.” Never! It is only a ˹useless˺ appeal they make. And there is a barrier behind them until the Day they are resurrected
  23,101,"Then, when the Trumpet will be blown, there will be no kinship between them on that Day, nor will they ˹even care to˺ ask about one another"
  23,102,"As for those whose scale is heavy ˹with good deeds˺, it is they who will be successful"
  23,103,"But those whose scale is light, they will have doomed themselves, staying in Hell forever"
  23,104,"The Fire will burn their faces, leaving them deformed"
