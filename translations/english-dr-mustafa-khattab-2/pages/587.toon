quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When the sky splits open
  82,2,and when the stars fall away
  82,3,and when the seas burst forth
  82,4,and when the graves spill out
  82,5,˹then˺ each soul will know what it has sent forth or left behind
  82,6,"O humanity! What has emboldened you against your Lord, the Most Generous"
  82,7,"Who created you, fashioned you, and perfected your design"
  82,8,moulding you in whatever form He willed
  82,9,"But no! In fact, you deny the ˹final˺ Judgment"
  82,10,while you are certainly observed by vigilant
  82,11,"honourable angels, recording ˹everything˺"
  82,12,They know whatever you do
  82,13,"Indeed, the virtuous will be in bliss"
  82,14,and the wicked will be in Hell
  82,15,burning in it on Judgment Day
  82,16,and they will have no escape from it
  82,17,What will make you realize what Judgment Day is
  82,18,"Again, what will make you realize what Judgment Day is"
  82,19,"˹It is˺ the Day no soul will be of ˹any˺ benefit to another whatsoever, for all authority on that Day belongs to God ˹entirely˺"
  83,1,Woe to the defrauders
  83,2,Those who take full measure ˹when they buy˺ from people
  83,3,but give less when they measure or weigh for buyers
  83,4,Do such people not think that they will be resurrected
  83,5,for a tremendous Day—
  83,6,the Day ˹all˺ people will stand before the Lord of all worlds
