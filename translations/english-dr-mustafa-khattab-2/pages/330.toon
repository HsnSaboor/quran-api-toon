quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  21,91,"And ˹remember˺ the one who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her through Our angel, ˹Gabriel,˺ making her and her son a sign for all peoples"
  21,92,"˹O prophets!˺ Indeed, this religion of yours is ˹only˺ one, and I am your Lord, so worship Me ˹alone˺"
  21,93,Yet the people have divided it into sects. But to Us they will all return
  21,94,"So whoever does good and is a believer will never be denied ˹the reward for˺ their striving, for We are recording it all"
  21,95,It is impossible for a society which We have destroyed to ever rise again
  21,96,"until ˹after˺ Gog and Magog have broken loose ˹from the barrier˺, swarming down from every hill"
  21,97,"ushering in the True Promise. Then—behold!—the disbelievers will stare ˹in horror, crying,˺ “Oh, woe to us! We have truly been heedless of this. In fact, we have been wrongdoers.”"
  21,98,Certainly you ˹disbelievers˺ and whatever you worship instead of God will be the fuel of Hell. You are ˹all˺ bound to enter it
  21,99,"Had those idols been ˹true˺ gods, they would not have entered it. And they will be there forever"
  21,100,"In it they will groan, and will not be able to hear"
  21,101,Surely those for whom We have destined the finest reward will be kept far away from Hell
