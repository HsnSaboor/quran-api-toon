quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,23,"No intercession will be of any benefit with Him, except by those granted permission by Him. ˹At last,˺ when the dread ˹of Judgment Day˺ is relieved from their hearts ˹because they are permitted to intercede˺, they will ˹excitedly˺ ask ˹the angels˺, “What has your Lord ˹just˺ said?” The angels will reply, “The truth! And He is the Most High, All-Great.”"
  34,24,"Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?” Say, “God! Now, certainly one of our two groups is ˹rightly˺ guided; the other is clearly astray.”"
  34,25,"Say, “You will not be accountable for our misdeeds, nor will we be accountable for your deeds.”"
  34,26,"Say, “Our Lord will gather us together, then He will judge between us with the truth. For He is the All-Knowing Judge.”"
  34,27,"Say, “Show me those ˹idols˺ you have joined with Him as partners. No! In fact, He ˹alone˺ is God—the Almighty, All-Wise.”"
  34,28,"We have sent you ˹O Prophet˺ only as a deliverer of good news and a warner to all of humanity, but most people do not know"
  34,29,"And they ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass, if what you say is true?”"
  34,30,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “A Day has ˹already˺ been appointed for you, which you can neither delay nor advance by a ˹single˺ moment.”"
  34,31,"The disbelievers vow, “We will never believe in this Quran, nor in those ˹Scriptures˺ before it.” If only you could see when the wrongdoers will be detained before their Lord, throwing blame at each other! The lowly ˹followers˺ will say to the arrogant ˹leaders˺, “Had it not been for you, we would certainly have been believers.”"
