quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  71,11,He will shower you with abundant rain
  71,12,"supply you with wealth and children, and give you gardens as well as rivers"
  71,13,What is the matter with you that you are not in awe of the Majesty of God
  71,14,when He truly created you in stages ˹of development˺
  71,15,"Do you not see how God created seven heavens, one above the other"
  71,16,"placing the moon within them as a ˹reflected˺ light, and the sun as a ˹radiant˺ lamp"
  71,17,God ˹alone˺ caused you to grow from the earth like a plant
  71,18,"Then He will return you to it, and then simply bring you forth ˹again˺"
  71,19,And God ˹alone˺ spread out the earth for you
  71,20,to walk along its spacious pathways.’”
  71,21,"˹Eventually,˺ Noah cried, “My Lord! They have certainly persisted in disobeying me, and followed ˹instead˺ those ˹elite˺ whose ˹abundant˺ wealth and children only increase them in loss"
  71,22,and who have devised a tremendous plot
  71,23,"urging ˹their followers˺, ‘Do not abandon your idols—especially Wadd, Suwâ’, Yaghûth, Ya’ûq, and Nasr.’"
  71,24,"Those ˹elite˺ have already led many astray. So ˹O Lord˺, only allow the wrongdoers to stray farther away.”"
  71,25,"So because of their sins, they were drowned, then admitted into the Fire. And they found none to help them against God"
  71,26,"Noah had prayed, “My Lord! Do not leave a single disbeliever on earth"
  71,27,"For if You spare ˹any of˺ them, they will certainly mislead Your servants, and give birth only to ˹wicked˺ sinners, staunch disbelievers"
  71,28,"My Lord! Forgive me, my parents, and whoever enters my house in faith, and ˹all˺ believing men and women. And increase the wrongdoers only in destruction.”"
