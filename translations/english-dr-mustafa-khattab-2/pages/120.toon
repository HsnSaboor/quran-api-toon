quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,71,"They thought there would be no consequences, so they turned a blind eye and a deaf ear. Yet God turned to them in forgiveness ˹after their repentance˺, but again many became blind and deaf. And God is All-Seeing of what they do"
  5,72,"Those who say, “God is the Messiah, son of Mary,” have certainly fallen into disbelief. The Messiah ˹himself˺ said, “O Children of Israel! Worship God—my Lord and your Lord.” Whoever associates others with God ˹in worship˺ will surely be forbidden Paradise by God. Their home will be the Fire. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers"
  5,73,"Those who say, “God is one in a Trinity,” have certainly fallen into disbelief. There is only One God. If they do not stop saying this, those who disbelieve among them will be afflicted with a painful punishment"
  5,74,"Will they not turn to God in repentance and seek His forgiveness? And God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  5,75,"The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger. ˹Many˺ messengers had ˹come and˺ gone before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They both ate food. See how We make the signs clear to them, yet see how they are deluded ˹from the truth˺"
  5,76,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “How can you worship besides God those who can neither harm nor benefit you? And God ˹alone˺ is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.”"
