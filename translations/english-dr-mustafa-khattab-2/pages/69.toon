quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  3,149,"O believers! If you yield to the disbelievers, they will drag you back to disbelief—and you will become losers"
  3,150,"But no! God is your Guardian, and He is the best Helper"
  3,151,We will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers for associating ˹false gods˺ with God—a practice He has never authorized. The Fire will be their home—what an evil place for the wrongdoers to stay
  3,152,"Indeed, God fulfilled His promise to you when you ˹initially˺ swept them away by His Will, then your courage weakened and you disputed about the command and disobeyed, after God had brought victory within your reach. Some of you were after worldly gain while others desired a heavenly reward. He denied you victory over them as a test, yet He has pardoned you. And God is Gracious to the believers"
  3,153,"˹Remember˺ when you were running far away ˹in panic˺—not looking at anyone—while the Messenger was calling to you from behind! So God rewarded your disobedience with distress upon distress. Now, do not grieve over the victory you were denied or the injury you suffered. And God is All-Aware of what you do"
