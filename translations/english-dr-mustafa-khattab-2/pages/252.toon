quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  13,19,Can the one who knows that your Lord’s revelation to you ˹O Prophet˺ is the truth be like the one who is blind? None will be mindful ˹of this˺ except people of reason
  13,20,"˹They are˺ those who honour God’s covenant, never breaking the pledge"
  13,21,"and those who maintain whatever ˹ties˺ God has ordered to be maintained, stand in awe of their Lord, and fear strict judgment"
  13,22,"And ˹they are˺ those who endure patiently, seeking their Lord’s pleasure, establish prayer, donate from what We have provided for them—secretly and openly—and respond to evil with good. It is they who will have the ultimate abode"
  13,23,"the Gardens of Eternity, which they will enter along with the righteous among their parents, spouses, and descendants. And the angels will enter upon them from every gate, ˹saying,˺"
  13,24,“Peace be upon you for your perseverance. How excellent is the ultimate abode!”
  13,25,"And those who violate God’s covenant after it has been affirmed, break whatever ˹ties˺ God has ordered to be maintained, and spread corruption in the land—it is they who will be condemned and will have the worst abode"
  13,26,"God gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills. And the disbelievers become prideful of ˹the pleasures of˺ this worldly life. But the life of this world, compared to the Hereafter, is nothing but a fleeting enjoyment"
  13,27,"The disbelievers say, “If only a sign could be sent down to him from his Lord.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Indeed, God leaves to stray whoever He wills, and guides to Himself whoever turns to Him—"
  13,28,those who believe and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of God. Surely in the remembrance of God do hearts find comfort
