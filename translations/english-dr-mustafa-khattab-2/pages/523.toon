quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  51,52,"Similarly, no messenger came to those before them without being told: “A magician or a madman!”"
  51,53,"Have they passed this ˹cliché˺ down to one another? In fact, they have ˹all˺ been a transgressing people"
  51,54,"So ˹now˺ turn away from them ˹O Prophet˺, for you will not be blamed"
  51,55,But ˹continue to˺ remind. For certainly reminders benefit the believers
  51,56,I did not create jinn and humans except to worship Me
  51,57,"I seek no provision from them, nor do I need them to feed Me"
  51,58,"Indeed, God ˹alone˺ is the Supreme Provider—Lord of all Power, Ever Mighty"
  51,59,The wrongdoers will certainly have a share ˹of the torment˺ like that of their predecessors. So do not let them ask Me to hasten ˹it˺
  51,60,Woe then to the disbelievers when they face their Day which they are warned of
  52,1,By Mount Ṭûr
  52,2,And by the Book written
  52,3,on open pages ˹for all to read˺
  52,4,And by the ˹Sacred˺ House frequently visited
  52,5,And by the canopy raised ˹high˺
  52,6,And by the seas set on fire
  52,7,"Indeed, the punishment of your Lord will come to pass—"
  52,8,none will avert it—
  52,9,on the Day the heavens will be shaken violently
  52,10,and the mountains will be blown away entirely
  52,11,Then woe on that Day to the deniers—
  52,12,those who amuse themselves with falsehood
  52,13,˹It is˺ the Day they will be fiercely shoved into the Fire of Hell
  52,14,"˹They will be told,˺ “This is the Fire which you used to deny"
