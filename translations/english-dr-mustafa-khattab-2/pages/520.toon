quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,"˹Imagine˺ how many peoples We destroyed before them, who were far mightier than them. Then ˹when the torment came,˺ they ˹desperately˺ sought refuge in the land. ˹But˺ was there any escape"
  50,37,Surely in this is a reminder for whoever has a ˹mindful˺ heart and lends an attentive ear
  50,38,"Indeed, We created the heavens and the earth and everything in between in six Days, and We were not ˹even˺ touched with fatigue"
  50,39,So be patient ˹O Prophet˺ with what they say. And glorify the praises of your Lord before sunrise and before sunset
  50,40,And glorify Him during part of the night and after the prayers
  50,41,And listen! On the Day the caller will call out from a near place
  50,42,"the Day all will hear the ˹mighty˺ Blast in ˹all˺ truth, that will be the Day of emergence ˹from the graves˺"
  50,43,It is certainly We Who give life and cause death. And to Us is the final return
  50,44,"˹Beware of˺ the Day the earth will split open, letting them rush forth. That will be an easy gathering for Us"
  50,45,We know best what they say. And you ˹O Prophet˺ are not ˹there˺ to compel them ˹to believe˺. So remind with the Quran ˹only˺ those who fear My warning
  51,1,By the winds scattering ˹dust˺
  51,2,and ˹the clouds˺ loaded with rain
  51,3,and ˹the ships˺ gliding with ease
  51,4,and ˹the angels˺ administering affairs by ˹God’s˺ command
  51,5,"Indeed, what you are promised is true"
  51,6,And the Judgment will certainly come to pass
