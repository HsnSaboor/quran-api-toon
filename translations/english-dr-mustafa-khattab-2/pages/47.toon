quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"Those who consume interest will stand ˹on Judgment Day˺ like those driven to madness by Satan’s touch. That is because they say, “Trade is no different than interest.” But God has permitted trading and forbidden interest. Whoever refrains—after having received warning from their Lord—may keep their previous gains, and their case is left to God. As for those who persist, it is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever"
  2,276,God has made interest fruitless and charity fruitful. And God does not like any ungrateful evildoer
  2,277,"Indeed, those who believe, do good, establish prayer, and pay alms-tax will receive their reward from their Lord, and there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve"
  2,278,"O believers! Fear God, and give up outstanding interest if you are ˹true˺ believers"
  2,279,"If you do not, then beware of a war with God and His Messenger! But if you repent, you may retain your principal—neither inflicting nor suffering harm"
  2,280,"If it is difficult for someone to repay a debt, postpone it until a time of ease. And if you waive it as an act of charity, it will be better for you, if only you knew"
  2,281,"Be mindful of the Day when you will ˹all˺ be returned to God, then every soul will be paid in full for what it has done, and none will be wronged"
