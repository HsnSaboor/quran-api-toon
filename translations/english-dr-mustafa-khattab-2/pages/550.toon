quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  60,6,"You certainly have an excellent example in them for whoever has hope in God and the Last Day. But whoever turns away, then surely God ˹alone˺ is the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy"
  60,7,"˹In time,˺ God may bring about goodwill between you and those of them you ˹now˺ hold as enemies. For God is Most Capable. And God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  60,8,God does not forbid you from dealing kindly and fairly with those who have neither fought nor driven you out of your homes. Surely God loves those who are fair
  60,9,"God only forbids you from befriending those who have fought you for ˹your˺ faith, driven you out of your homes, or supported ˹others˺ in doing so. And whoever takes them as friends, then it is they who are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers"
  60,10,"O believers! When the believing women come to you as emigrants, test their intentions—their faith is best known to God—and if you find them to be believers, then do not send them back to the disbelievers. These ˹women˺ are not lawful ˹wives˺ for the disbelievers, nor are the disbelievers lawful ˹husbands˺ for them. ˹But˺ repay the disbelievers whatever ˹dowries˺ they had paid. And there is no blame on you if you marry these ˹women˺ as long as you pay them their dowries. And do not hold on to marriage with polytheistic women. ˹But˺ demand ˹repayment of˺ whatever ˹dowries˺ you had paid, and let the disbelievers do the same. That is the judgment of God—He judges between you. And God is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  60,11,"And if any of your wives desert you to the disbelievers, and later you take spoils from them, then pay those whose wives have gone, the equivalent of whatever ˹dowry˺ they had paid. And be mindful of God, in Whom you believe"
