quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  13,35,The description of the Paradise promised to the righteous is that under it rivers flow; eternal is its fruit as well as its shade. That is the ˹ultimate˺ outcome for the righteous. But the outcome for the disbelievers is the Fire
  13,36,"˹The believers among˺ those who were given the Scripture rejoice at what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺, while some ˹disbelieving˺ factions deny a portion of it. Say, “I have only been commanded to worship God, associating none with Him ˹in worship˺. To Him I invite ˹all˺, and to Him is my return.”"
  13,37,"And so We have revealed it as an authority in Arabic. And if you were to follow their desires after ˹all˺ the knowledge that has come to you, there would be none to protect or shield you from God"
  13,38,We have certainly sent messengers before you ˹O Prophet˺ and blessed them with wives and offspring. It was not for any messenger to bring a sign without God’s permission. Every destined matter has a ˹set˺ time
  13,39,"God eliminates and confirms what He wills, and with Him is the Master Record"
  13,40,"Whether We show you ˹O Prophet˺ some of what We threaten them with, or cause you to die ˹before that˺, your duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺. Judgment is for Us"
  13,41,Do they not see that We gradually reduce their land from its borders? God decides—none can reverse His decision. And He is swift in reckoning
  13,42,"Those ˹disbelievers˺ before them ˹secretly˺ planned, but God has the ultimate plan. He knows what every soul commits. And the disbelievers will soon know who will have the ultimate outcome"
