quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  57,4,"He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, then established Himself on the Throne. He knows whatever goes into the earth and whatever comes out of it, and whatever descends from the sky and whatever ascends into it. And He is with you wherever you are. For God is All-Seeing of what you do"
  57,5,To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And to God all matters are returned
  57,6,He merges the night into day and the day into night. And He knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart
  57,7,"Believe in God and His Messenger, and donate from what He has entrusted you with. So those of you who believe and donate will have a mighty reward"
  57,8,"Why do you not believe in God while the Messenger is inviting you to have faith in your Lord, although He has already taken your covenant, if you will ever believe"
  57,9,He is the One Who sends down clear revelations to His servant to bring you out of darkness and into light. For indeed God is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to you
  57,10,"And why should you not spend in the cause of God, while God is the ˹sole˺ inheritor of the heavens and the earth? Those of you who donated and fought before the victory ˹over Mecca˺ are unparalleled. They are far greater in rank than those who donated and fought afterwards. Yet God has promised each a fine reward. And God is All-Aware of what you do"
  57,11,"Who is it that will lend to God a good loan which God will multiply ˹many times over˺ for them, and they will have an honourable reward"
