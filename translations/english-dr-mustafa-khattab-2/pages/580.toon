quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  76,26,"and prostrate before Him during part of the night, and glorify Him long at night"
  76,27,"Surely those ˹pagans˺ love this fleeting world, ˹totally˺ neglecting a weighty Day ahead of them"
  76,28,"It is We Who created them and perfected their ˹physical˺ form. But if We will, We can easily replace them with others"
  76,29,Surely this is a reminder. So let whoever wills take the ˹Right˺ Way to their Lord
  76,30,"But you cannot will ˹to do so˺ unless God wills. Indeed, God is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  76,31,"He admits whoever He wills into His mercy. As for the wrongdoers, He has prepared for them a painful punishment"
  77,1,By those ˹winds˺ sent forth successively
  77,2,and those blowing violently
  77,3,and those scattering ˹rainclouds˺ widely
  77,4,And ˹by˺ those ˹angels˺ fully distinguishing ˹truth from falsehood˺
  77,5,and those delivering revelation
  77,6,ending excuses and giving warnings
  77,7,"Surely, what you are promised will come to pass"
  77,8,So when the stars are put out
  77,9,and the sky is torn apart
  77,10,and the mountains are blown away
  77,11,and the messengers’ time ˹to testify˺ comes up—
  77,12,for which Day has all this been set
  77,13,For the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision
  77,14,And what will make you realize what the Day of Decision is
  77,15,Woe on that Day to the deniers
  77,16,Did We not destroy earlier disbelievers
  77,17,And We will make the later disbelievers follow them
  77,18,This is how We deal with the wicked
  77,19,Woe on that Day to the deniers
