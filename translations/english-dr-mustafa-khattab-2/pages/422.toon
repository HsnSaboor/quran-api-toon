  33,31,"And whoever of you devoutly obeys God and His Messenger and does good, We will grant her double the reward, and We have prepared for her an honourable provision"
  33,32,"O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women: if you are mindful ˹of God˺, then do not be overly effeminate in speech ˹with men˺ or those with sickness in their hearts may be tempted, but speak in a moderate tone"
  33,33,"Settle in your homes, and do not display yourselves as women did in the days of ˹pre-Islamic˺ ignorance. Establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and obey God and His Messenger. God only intends to keep ˹the causes of˺ evil away from you and purify you completely, O members of the ˹Prophet’s˺ family"
  33,34,"˹Always˺ remember what is recited in your homes of God’s revelations and ˹prophetic˺ wisdom. Surely God is Most Subtle, All-Aware"
  33,35,"Surely ˹for˺ Muslim men and women, believing men and women, devout men and women, truthful men and women, patient men and women, humble men and women, charitable men and women, fasting men and women, men and women who guard their chastity, and men and women who remember God often—for ˹all of˺ them God has prepared forgiveness and a great reward"
