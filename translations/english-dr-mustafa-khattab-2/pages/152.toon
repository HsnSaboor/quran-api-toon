quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  7,12,"God asked, “What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?” He replied, “I am better than he is: You created me from fire and him from clay.”"
  7,13,"God said, “Then get down from Paradise! It is not for you to be arrogant here. So get out! You are truly one of the disgraced.”"
  7,14,"He appealed, “Then delay my end until the Day of their resurrection.”"
  7,15,"God said, “You are delayed ˹until the appointed Day˺.”"
  7,16,"He said, “For leaving me to stray I will lie in ambush for them on Your Straight Path"
  7,17,"I will approach them from their front, their back, their right, their left, and then You will find most of them ungrateful.”"
  7,18,"God said, “Get out of Paradise! You are disgraced and rejected! I will certainly fill up Hell with you and your followers all together.”"
  7,19,"˹God said,˺ “O Adam! Live with your wife in Paradise and eat from wherever you please, but do not approach this tree, or else you will be wrongdoers.”"
  7,20,"Then Satan tempted them in order to expose what was hidden of their nakedness. He said, “Your Lord has forbidden this tree to you only to prevent you from becoming angels or immortals.”"
  7,21,"And he swore to them, “I am truly your sincere advisor.”"
  7,22,"So he brought about their fall through deception. And when they tasted of the tree, their nakedness was exposed to them, prompting them to cover themselves with leaves from Paradise. Then their Lord called out to them, “Did I not forbid you from that tree and ˹did I not˺ tell you that Satan is your sworn enemy?”"
