quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,42,"They eagerly listen to falsehood and consume forbidden gain. So if they come to you ˹O Prophet˺, either judge between them or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they cannot harm you whatsoever. But if you judge between them, then do so with justice. Surely God loves those who are just"
  5,43,"But why do they come to you for judgment when they ˹already˺ have the Torah containing God’s judgment, then they turn away after all? They are not ˹true˺ believers"
  5,44,"Indeed, We revealed the Torah, containing guidance and light, by which the prophets, who submitted themselves to God, made judgments for Jews. So too did the rabbis and scholars judge according to God’s Book, with which they were entrusted and of which they were made keepers. So do not fear the people; fear Me! Nor trade my revelations for a fleeting gain. And those who do not judge by what God has revealed are ˹truly˺ the disbelievers"
  5,45,"We ordained for them in the Torah, “A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth—and for wounds equal retaliation.” But whoever waives it charitably, it will be atonement for them. And those who do not judge by what God has revealed are ˹truly˺ the wrongdoers"
