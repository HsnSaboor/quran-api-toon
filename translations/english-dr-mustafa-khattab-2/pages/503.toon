quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  46,6,"And when ˹such˺ people will be gathered together, those ˹gods˺ will be their enemies and will disown their worship"
  46,7,"Whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, the disbelievers say of the truth when it has come to them, “This is pure magic.”"
  46,8,"Or do they say, “He has fabricated this ˹Quran˺!”? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If I have done so, then there is nothing whatsoever you can do to save me from God. He knows best what ˹slurs˺ you indulge about it. Sufficient is He as a Witness between you and me. And He is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”"
  46,9,"Say, “I am not the first messenger ever sent, nor do I know what will happen to me or you. I only follow what is revealed to me. And I am only sent with a clear warning.”"
  46,10,"Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Consider if this ˹Quran˺ is ˹truly˺ from God and you deny it, and a witness from the Children of Israel attests to it and then believes, whereas you act arrogantly. Surely God does not guide the wrongdoing people.”"
  46,11,"The disbelievers say of the believers, “Had it been ˹something˺ good, they would not have beaten us to it.” Now since they reject its guidance, they will say, “˹This is˺ an ancient fabrication!”"

  46,14,"It is they who will be the residents of Paradise, staying there forever, as a reward for what they used to do"
