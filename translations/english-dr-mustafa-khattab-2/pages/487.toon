quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  42,32,And among His signs are the ships like mountains ˹sailing˺ in the sea
  42,33,"If He wills, He can calm the wind, leaving the ships motionless on the water. Surely in this are signs for whoever is steadfast, grateful"
  42,34,Or He can wreck the ships for what the people have committed—though He forgives much—
  42,35,so those who dispute about Our signs may know that they have no refuge
  42,36,Whatever ˹pleasure˺ you have been given is ˹no more than a fleeting˺ enjoyment of this worldly life. But what is with God is far better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord
  42,37,"who avoid major sins and shameful deeds, and forgive when angered"
  42,38,"who respond to their Lord, establish prayer, conduct their affairs by mutual consultation, and donate from what We have provided for them"
  42,39,and who enforce justice when wronged
  42,40,"The reward of an evil deed is its equivalent. But whoever pardons and seeks reconciliation, then their reward is with God. He certainly does not like the wrongdoers"
  42,41,There is no blame on those who enforce justice after being wronged
  42,42,Blame is only on those who wrong people and transgress in the land unjustly. It is they who will suffer a painful punishment
  42,43,And whoever endures patiently and forgives—surely this is a resolve to aspire to
  42,44,"And whoever God leaves to stray will have no guide after Him. You will see the wrongdoers, when they face the torment, pleading, “Is there any way back ˹to the world˺?”"
