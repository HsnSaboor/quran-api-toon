  12,5,"He replied, “O my dear son! Do not relate your vision to your brothers, or they will devise a plot against you. Surely Satan is a sworn enemy to humankind"
  12,6,"And so will your Lord choose you ˹O Joseph˺, and teach you the interpretation of dreams, and perfect His favour upon you and the descendants of Jacob—˹just˺ as He once perfected it upon your forefathers, Abraham and Isaac. Surely your Lord is All-Knowing, All-Wise.”"
  12,7,"Indeed, in the story of Joseph and his brothers there are lessons for all who ask"
  12,8,"˹Remember˺ when they said ˹to one another˺, “Surely Joseph and his brother ˹Benjamin˺ are more beloved to our father than we, even though we are a group of so many. Indeed, our father is clearly mistaken"
  12,9,"Kill Joseph or cast him out to some ˹distant˺ land so that our father’s attention will be only ours, then after that you may ˹repent and˺ become righteous people!”"

  12,12,Send him out with us tomorrow so that he may enjoy himself and play. And we will really watch over him.”
  12,13,"He responded, “It would truly sadden me if you took him away with you, and I fear that a wolf may devour him while you are negligent of him.”"
  12,14,"They said, “If a wolf were to devour him, despite our strong group, then we would certainly be losers!”"
