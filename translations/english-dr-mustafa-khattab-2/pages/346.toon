quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,60,"and who do whatever ˹good˺ they do with their hearts fearful, ˹knowing˺ that they will return to their Lord—"
  23,61,"it is they who race to do good deeds, always taking the lead"
  23,62,We never require of any soul more than what it can afford. And with Us is a record which speaks the truth. None will be wronged
  23,63,"But the hearts of those ˹who disbelieve˺ are oblivious to ˹all of˺ this, and they have other ˹evil˺ deeds, opposite to this, in which they are engrossed"
  23,64,"But as soon as We seize their elite with torment, they start to cry for help"
  23,65,"˹They will be told,˺ “Do not cry for help today. Surely you will never be saved from Us"
  23,66,"Indeed, My revelations were recited to you, but you used to back away ˹in disgust˺"
  23,67,"boasting of the Sacred House, and babbling ˹nonsense about the Quran˺ by night.”"
  23,68,Is it because they have never contemplated the Word ˹of God˺? Or ˹because˺ there has come to them something that did not come to their forefathers
  23,69,"Or ˹because˺ they failed to recognize their Messenger, and so they denied him"
  23,70,"Or ˹because˺ they say, “He is insane?” In fact, he has come to them with the truth, but most of them are resentful of the truth"
  23,71,"Had the truth followed their desires, the heavens, the earth, and all those in them would have certainly been corrupted. In fact, We have brought them ˹the means to˺ their glory, but they turn away from it"
  23,72,"Or ˹is it because˺ you ˹O Prophet˺ are asking them for tribute? But the reward of your Lord is best, for He is the Best Provider"
  23,73,And surely you are calling them to the Straight Path
  23,74,but those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are certainly deviating from that Path
