quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  35,31,"The Book We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ is the truth, confirming what came before it. Surely God is All-Aware, All-Seeing of His servants"
  35,32,"Then We granted the Book to those We have chosen from Our servants. Some of them wrong themselves, some follow a middle course, and some are foremost in good deeds by God’s Will. That is ˹truly˺ the greatest bounty"
  35,33,"They will enter the Gardens of Eternity, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their clothing will be silk"
  35,34,"And they will say, “Praise be to God, Who has kept away from us all ˹causes of˺ sorrow. Our Lord is indeed All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative"
  35,35,"˹He is the One˺ Who—out of His grace—has settled us in the Home of Everlasting Stay, where we will be touched by neither fatigue nor weariness.”"
  35,36,"As for the disbelievers, they will have the Fire of Hell, where they will not be ˹allowed to be˺ finished by death, nor will its torment be lightened for them. This is how We reward every ˹stubborn˺ disbeliever"
  35,37,"There they will be ˹fervently˺ screaming, “Our Lord! Take us out ˹and send us back˺. We will do good, unlike what we used to do.” ˹They will be told,˺ “Did We not give you lives long enough so that whoever wanted to be mindful could have done so? And the warner came to you. So taste ˹the punishment˺, for the wrongdoers have no helper.”"
  35,38,"Indeed, God is the Knower of the unseen of the heavens and the earth. He surely knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart"
