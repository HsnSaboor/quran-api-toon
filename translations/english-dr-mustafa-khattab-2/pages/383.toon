quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  27,64,"Or ˹ask them,˺ “Who originates the creation then resurrects it, and gives you provisions from the heavens and the earth? Is it another god besides God?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Show ˹me˺ your proof, if what you say is true.”"
  27,65,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “None in the heavens and the earth has knowledge of the unseen except God. Nor do they know when they will be resurrected"
  27,66,"No! Their knowledge of the Hereafter amounts to ignorance. In fact, they are in doubt about it. In truth, they are ˹totally˺ blind to it"
  27,67,"The disbelievers ask, “When we and our fathers are reduced to dust, will we really be brought forth ˹alive˺"
  27,68,"We have already been promised this, as well as our forefathers earlier. This is nothing but ancient fables!”"
  27,69,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Travel throughout the land and see the fate of the wicked.”"
  27,70,"Do not grieve for them, nor be distressed by their schemes"
  27,71,"They ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass, if what you say is true?”"
  27,72,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Perhaps some of what you seek to hasten is close at hand.”"
  27,73,"Surely your Lord is ever Bountiful to humanity, but most of them are ungrateful"
  27,74,And surely your Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they reveal
  27,75,For there is nothing hidden in the heavens or the earth without being ˹written˺ in a perfect Record
  27,76,"Indeed, this Quran clarifies for the Children of Israel most of what they differ over"
