quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,49,"Say, “The truth has come, and falsehood will vanish, never to return.”"
  34,50,"Say, “If I am astray, the loss is only mine. And if I am guided, it is ˹only˺ because of what my Lord reveals to me. He is indeed All-Hearing, Ever Near.”"
  34,51,If only you could see when they will be horrified with no escape ˹on Judgment Day˺! And they will be seized from a nearby place
  34,52,"They will ˹then˺ cry, “We do ˹now˺ believe in it ˹all˺.” But how could they ˹possibly˺ attain faith from a place so far-off ˹from the world˺"
  34,53,"while they had already rejected it before, guessing blindly from a place ˹equally˺ far-away ˹from the Hereafter˺"
  34,54,"They will be sealed off from whatever they desire, as was done to their counterparts before. Indeed, they were ˹all˺ in alarming doubt"
  35,1,"All praise is for God, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who made angels ˹as His˺ messengers with wings—two, three, or four. He increases in creation whatever He wills. Surely God is Most Capable of everything"
  35,2,"Whatever mercy God opens up for people, none can withhold it. And whatever He withholds, none but Him can release it. For He is the Almighty, All-Wise"
  35,3,O humanity! Remember God’s favours upon you. Is there any creator other than God who provides for you from the heavens and the earth? There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. How can you then be deluded ˹from the truth˺
