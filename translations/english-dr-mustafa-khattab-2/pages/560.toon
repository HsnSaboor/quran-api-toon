quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  66,1,"O Prophet! Why do you prohibit ˹yourself˺ from what God has made lawful to you, seeking to please your wives? And God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  66,2,"God has already ordained for you ˹believers˺ the way to absolve yourselves from your oaths. For God is your Guardian. And He is the All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  66,3,"˹Remember˺ when the Prophet had ˹once˺ confided something to one of his wives, then when she disclosed it ˹to another wife˺ and God made it known to him, he presented ˹to her˺ part of what was disclosed and overlooked a part. So when he informed her of it, she exclaimed, “Who told you this?” He replied, “I was informed by the All-Knowing, All-Aware.”"
  66,4,"˹It will be better˺ if you ˹wives˺ both turn to God in repentance, for your hearts have certainly faltered. But if you ˹continue to˺ collaborate against him, then ˹know that˺ God Himself is his Guardian. And Gabriel, the righteous believers, and the angels are ˹all˺ his supporters as well"
  66,5,"Perhaps, if he were to divorce you ˹all˺, his Lord would replace you with better wives who are submissive ˹to God˺, faithful ˹to Him˺, devout, repentant, dedicated to worship and fasting—previously married or virgins"
  66,6,"O believers! Protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones, overseen by formidable and severe angels, who never disobey whatever God orders—always doing as commanded"
  66,7,"˹The deniers will then be told,˺ “O disbelievers! Make no excuses this Day! You are only rewarded for what you used to do.”"
