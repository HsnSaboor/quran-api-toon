quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  44,40,Surely the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision is the time appointed for all—
  44,41,"the Day no kith or kin will be of benefit to another whatsoever, nor will they be helped"
  44,42,"except those shown mercy by God. He is truly the Almighty, Most Merciful"
  44,43,Surely ˹the fruit of˺ the tree of Zaqqûm
  44,44,will be the food of the evildoer
  44,45,"Like molten metal, it will boil in the bellies"
  44,46,like the boiling of hot water
  44,47,"˹It will be said,˺ “Seize them and drag them into the depths of the Hellfire"
  44,48,Then pour over their heads the torment of boiling water.”
  44,49,"˹The wicked will be told,˺ “Taste this. You mighty, noble one"
  44,50,This is truly what you ˹all˺ used to doubt.”
  44,51,"Indeed, the righteous will be in a secure place"
  44,52,amid Gardens and springs
  44,53,"dressed in fine silk and rich brocade, facing one another"
  44,54,So it will be. And We will pair them to maidens with gorgeous eyes
  44,55,There they will call for every fruit in serenity
  44,56,"There they will never taste death, beyond the first death. And He will protect them from the punishment of the Hellfire—"
  44,57,as ˹an act of˺ grace from your Lord. That is ˹truly˺ the ultimate triumph
  44,58,"Indeed, We have made this ˹Quran˺ easy in your own language ˹O Prophet˺ so perhaps they will be mindful"
  44,59,Wait then! They too are certainly waiting
