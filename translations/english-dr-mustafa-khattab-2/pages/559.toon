quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  65,6,"Let them live where you live ˹during their waiting period˺, according to your means. And do not harass them to make their stay unbearable. If they are pregnant, then maintain them until they deliver. And if they nurse your child, compensate them, and consult together courteously. But if you fail to reach an agreement, then another woman will nurse ˹the child˺ for the father"
  65,7,"Let the man of wealth provide according to his means. As for the one with limited resources, let him provide according to whatever God has given him. God does not require of any soul beyond what He has given it. After hardship, God will bring about ease"

  65,10,"God has ˹also˺ prepared for them a severe punishment. So fear God, O people of reason and faith. God has indeed revealed to you a Reminder"
  65,11,"˹and sent˺ a messenger reciting to you God’s revelations, making things clear so that He may bring those who believe and do good out of darkness and into light. And whoever believes in God and does good will be admitted by Him into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. God will have indeed granted them an excellent provision"
  65,12,"God is the One Who created seven heavens ˹in layers˺, and likewise for the earth. The ˹divine˺ command descends between them so you may know that God is Most Capable of everything and that God certainly encompasses all things in ˹His˺ knowledge"
