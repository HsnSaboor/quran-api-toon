  32,1,Alif-Lãm-Mĩm
  32,2,The revelation of this Book is—beyond doubt—from the Lord of all worlds
  32,3,"Or do they say, “He has fabricated it!”? No! It is the truth from your Lord in order for you to warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, so they may be ˹rightly˺ guided"
  32,4,"It is God Who has created the heavens and the earth and everything in between in six Days, then established Himself on the Throne. You have no protector or intercessor besides Him. Will you not then be mindful"
  32,5,"He conducts every affair from the heavens to the earth, then it all ascends to Him on a Day whose length is a thousand years by your counting"
  32,6,"That is the Knower of the seen and unseen—the Almighty, Most Merciful"
  32,7,Who has perfected everything He created. And He originated the creation of humankind from clay
  32,8,Then He made his descendants from an extract of a humble fluid
  32,9,"then He fashioned them and had a spirit of His Own ˹creation˺ breathed into them. And He gave you hearing, sight, and intellect. ˹Yet˺ you hardly give any thanks"
  32,10,"˹Still˺ they ask ˹mockingly˺, “When we are disintegrated into the earth, will we really be raised as a new creation?” In fact, they are in denial of the meeting with their Lord"
  32,11,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Your soul will be taken by the Angel of Death, who is in charge of you. Then to your Lord you will ˹all˺ be returned.”"
