  7,171,"And ˹remember˺ when We raised the mountain over them as if it were a cloud and they thought it would fall on them. ˹We said,˺ “Hold firmly to that ˹Scripture˺ which We have given you and observe its teachings so perhaps you will become mindful ˹of God˺.”"
  7,172,"And ˹remember˺ when your Lord brought forth from the loins of the children of Adam their descendants and had them testify regarding themselves. ˹God asked,˺ “Am I not your Lord?” They replied, “Yes, You are!

  7,173,"Nor say, ‘It was our forefathers who had associated others ˹with God in worship˺ and we, as their descendants, followed in their footsteps. Will you then destroy us for the falsehood they invented?’”"
  7,174,"This is how We make our signs clear, so perhaps they will return ˹to the Right Path˺"
  7,175,"And relate to them ˹O Prophet˺ the story of the one to whom We gave Our signs, but he abandoned them, so Satan took hold of him, and he became a deviant"

This is the example of the people who deny Our signs. So narrate ˹to them˺ stories ˹of the past˺, so perhaps they will reflect"
  7,177,What an evil example of those who denied Our signs! They ˹only˺ wronged their own souls
  7,178,"Whoever God guides is truly guided. And whoever He leaves to stray, they are the ˹true˺ losers"
