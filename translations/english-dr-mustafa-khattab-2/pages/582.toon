quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,What are they asking one another about
  78,2,About the momentous news
  78,3,over which they disagree
  78,4,But no! They will come to know
  78,5,"Again, no! They will come to know"
  78,6,Have We not smoothed out the earth ˹like a bed˺
  78,7,and ˹made˺ the mountains as ˹its˺ pegs
  78,8,and created you in pairs
  78,9,and made your sleep for rest
  78,10,and made the night as a cover
  78,11,and made the day for livelihood
  78,12,and built above you seven mighty ˹heavens˺
  78,13,and placed ˹in them˺ a shining lamp
  78,14,and sent down from rainclouds pouring water
  78,15,producing by it grain and ˹various˺ plants
  78,16,and dense orchards
  78,17,"Indeed, the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision is an appointed time—"
  78,18,"˹it is˺ the Day the Trumpet will be blown, and you will ˹all˺ come forth in crowds"
  78,19,"The sky will be ˹split˺ open, becoming ˹many˺ gates"
  78,20,"and the mountains will be blown away, becoming ˹like˺ a mirage"
  78,21,"Indeed, Hell is lying in ambush"
  78,22,as a home for the transgressors
  78,23,where they will remain for ˹endless˺ ages
  78,24,There they will not taste any coolness or drink
  78,25,except boiling water and ˹oozing˺ pus—
  78,26,a fitting reward
  78,27,For they never expected any reckoning
  78,28,and totally rejected Our signs
  78,29,And We have everything recorded precisely
  78,30,"˹So the deniers will be told,˺ “Taste ˹the punishment˺, for all you will get from Us is more torment.”"
