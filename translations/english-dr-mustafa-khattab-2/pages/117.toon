quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,51,O believers! Take neither Jews nor Christians as guardians—they are guardians of each other. Whoever does so will be counted as one of them. Surely God does not guide the wrongdoing people
  5,52,"You see those with sickness in their hearts racing for their guardianship, saying ˹in justification˺, “We fear a turn of fortune will strike us.” But perhaps God will bring about ˹your˺ victory or another favour by His command, and they will regret what they have hidden in their hearts"
  5,53,"˹Only then,˺ the believers will ask ˹one another˺, “Are these the ones who swore solemn oaths by God that they were with you?” Their deeds have been in vain, so they have become losers"
  5,54,"O believers! Whoever among you abandons their faith, God will replace them with others who love Him and are loved by Him. They will be humble with the believers but firm towards the disbelievers, struggling in the Way of God; fearing no blame from anyone. This is the favour of God. He grants it to whoever He wills. And God is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing"
  5,55,"Your only guardians are God, His Messenger, and fellow believers—who establish prayer and pay alms-tax with humility"
  5,56,"Whoever allies themselves with God, His Messenger, and fellow believers, then it is certainly God’s party that will prevail"
  5,57,O believers! Do not seek the guardianship of those given the Scripture before you and the disbelievers who have made your faith a mockery and amusement. And be mindful of God if you are ˹truly˺ believers
