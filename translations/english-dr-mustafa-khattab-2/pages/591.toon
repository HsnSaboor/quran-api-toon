quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the heaven and the nightly star
  86,2,And what will make you realize what the nightly star is
  86,3,˹It is˺ the star of piercing brightness
  86,4,There is no soul without a vigilant angel ˹recording everything˺
  86,5,Let people then consider what they were created from
  86,6,˹They were˺ created from a spurting fluid
  86,7,stemming from between the backbone and the ribcage
  86,8,Surely He is fully capable of bringing them back ˹to life˺
  86,9,on the Day all secrets will be disclosed
  86,10,Then one will have neither power nor ˹any˺ helper
  86,11,By the sky with its recurring cycles
  86,12,and the earth with its sprouting plants
  86,13,Surely this ˹Quran˺ is a decisive word
  86,14,and is not to be taken lightly
  86,15,They are certainly devising ˹evil˺ plans
  86,16,but I too am planning
  86,17,So bear with the disbelievers ˹O Prophet˺. Let them be for ˹just˺ a little while
  87,1,"Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High"
  87,2,Who created and ˹perfectly˺ fashioned ˹all˺
  87,3,and Who ordained precisely and inspired accordingly
  87,4,and Who brings forth ˹green˺ pasture
  87,5,then reduces it to withered chaff
  87,6,"We will have you recite ˹the Quran, O Prophet,˺ so you will not forget ˹any of it˺"
  87,7,unless God wills otherwise. He surely knows what is open and what is hidden
  87,8,We will facilitate for you the Way of Ease
  87,9,So ˹always˺ remind ˹with the Quran˺—˹even˺ if the reminder is beneficial ˹only to some˺
  87,10,Those in awe ˹of God˺ will be mindful ˹of it˺
  87,11,But it will be shunned by the most wretched
  87,12,who will burn in the greatest Fire
  87,13,where they will not ˹be able to˺ live or die
  87,14,Successful indeed are those who purify themselves
  87,15,"remember the Name of their Lord, and pray"
