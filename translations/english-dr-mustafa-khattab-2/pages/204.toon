quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,107,"There are also those ˹hypocrites˺ who set up a mosque ˹only˺ to cause harm, promote disbelief, divide the believers, and as a base for those who had previously fought against God and His Messenger. They will definitely swear, “We intended nothing but good,” but God bears witness that they are surely liars"
  9,108,"Do not ˹O Prophet˺ ever pray in it. Certainly, a mosque founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy of your prayers. In it are men who love to be purified. And God loves those who purify themselves"
  9,109,"Which is better: those who laid the foundation of their building on the fear and pleasure of God, or those who did so on the edge of a crumbling cliff that tumbled down with them into the Fire of Hell? And God does not guide the wrongdoing people"
  9,110,"The building which they erected will never cease to fuel hypocrisy in their hearts until their hearts are torn apart. And God is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  9,111,"God has indeed purchased from the believers their lives and wealth in exchange for Paradise. They fight in the cause of God and kill or are killed. This is a true promise binding on Him in the Torah, the Gospel, and the Quran. And whose promise is truer than God’s? So rejoice in the exchange you have made with Him. That is ˹truly˺ the ultimate triumph"
