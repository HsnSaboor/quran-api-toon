quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,So the pleas of intercessors will be of no benefit to them
  74,49,"Now, what is the matter with them that they are turning away from the reminder"
  74,50,as if they were spooked zebras
  74,51,fleeing from a lion
  74,52,"In fact, each one of them wishes to be given a ˹personal˺ letter ˹from God˺ for all ˹to read˺"
  74,53,"But no! In fact, they do not fear the Hereafter"
  74,54,Enough! Surely this ˹Quran˺ is a reminder
  74,55,So let whoever wills be mindful of it
  74,56,But they cannot do so unless God wills. He ˹alone˺ is worthy to be feared and entitled to forgive
  75,1,I do swear by the Day of Judgment
  75,2,And I do swear by the self-reproaching soul
  75,3,Do people think We cannot reassemble their bones
  75,4,Yes ˹indeed˺! We are ˹most˺ capable of restoring ˹even˺ their very fingertips
  75,5,Still people want to deny what is yet to come
  75,6,"asking ˹mockingly˺, “When is this Day of Judgment?”"
  75,7,But when the sight is stunned
  75,8,and the moon is dimmed
  75,9,and the sun and the moon are brought together
  75,10,"on that Day one will cry, “Where is the escape?”"
  75,11,But no! There will be no refuge
  75,12,On that Day all will end up before your Lord
  75,13,All will then be informed of what they have sent forth and left behind
  75,14,"In fact, people will testify against their own souls"
  75,15,despite the excuses they come up with
  75,16,Do not rush your tongue trying to memorize ˹a revelation of˺ the Quran
  75,17,It is certainly upon Us to ˹make you˺ memorize and recite it
  75,18,"So once We have recited a revelation ˹through Gabriel˺, follow its recitation ˹closely˺"
  75,19,Then it is surely upon Us to make it clear ˹to you˺
