quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,"Indeed, those who do not believe in the Hereafter label angels as female"
  53,28,although they have no knowledge ˹in support˺ of this. They follow nothing but ˹inherited˺ assumptions. And surely assumptions can in no way replace the truth
  53,29,"So turn away ˹O Prophet˺ from whoever has shunned Our Reminder, only seeking the ˹fleeting˺ life of this world"
  53,30,This is the extent of their knowledge. Surely your Lord knows best who has strayed from His Way and who is ˹rightly˺ guided
  53,31,"To God ˹alone˺ belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth so that He may reward the evildoers according to what they did, and reward the good-doers with the finest reward—"
  53,32,"those who avoid major sins and shameful deeds, despite ˹stumbling on˺ minor sins. Surely your Lord is infinite in forgiveness. He knew well what would become of you as He created you from the earth and while you were ˹still˺ fetuses in the wombs of your mothers. So do not ˹falsely˺ elevate yourselves. He knows best who is ˹truly˺ righteous"
  53,33,"Have you seen the one who turned away ˹from Islam,˺"
  53,34,"and ˹initially˺ paid a little ˹for his salvation˺, and then stopped"
  53,35,Does he have the knowledge of the unseen so that he sees ˹the Hereafter˺
  53,36,Or has he not been informed of what is in the Scripture of Moses
  53,37,"and ˹that of˺ Abraham, who ˹perfectly˺ fulfilled ˹his covenant˺"
  53,38,˹They state˺ that no soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another
  53,39,and that each person will only have what they endeavoured towards
  53,40,and that ˹the outcome of˺ their endeavours will be seen ˹in their record˺
  53,41,then they will be fully rewarded
  53,42,and that to your Lord ˹alone˺ is the ultimate return ˹of all things˺
  53,43,"Moreover, He is the One Who brings about joy and sadness"
  53,44,And He is the One Who gives life and causes death
