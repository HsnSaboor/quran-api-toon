quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,and the secrets of the hearts will be laid bare—
  100,11,surely their Lord is All-Aware of them on that Day
  101,1,The Striking Disaster
  101,2,What is the Striking Disaster
  101,3,And what will make you realize what the Striking Disaster is
  101,4,˹It is˺ the Day people will be like scattered moths
  101,5,and the mountains will be like carded wool
  101,6,So as for those whose scale is heavy ˹with good deeds˺
  101,7,they will be in a life of bliss
  101,8,And as for those whose scale is light
  101,9,their home will be the abyss
  101,10,And what will make you realize what that is
  101,11,˹It is˺ a scorching Fire
  102,1,Competition for more ˹gains˺ diverts you ˹from God˺
  102,2,until you end up in ˹your˺ graves
  102,3,But no! You will soon come to know
  102,4,"Again, no! You will soon come to know"
  102,5,"Indeed, if you were to know ˹your fate˺ with certainty, ˹you would have acted differently˺"
  102,6,˹But˺ you will surely see the Hellfire
  102,7,"Again, you will surely see it with the eye of certainty"
  102,8,"Then, on that Day, you will definitely be questioned about ˹your worldly˺ pleasures"
