quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,15,"˹As for˺ those of your women who commit illegal intercourse—call four witnesses from among yourselves. If they testify, confine the offenders to their homes until they die or God ordains a ˹different˺ way for them"
  4,16,"And the two among you who commit this sin—discipline them. If they repent and mend their ways, relieve them. Surely God is ever Accepting of Repentance, Most Merciful"
  4,17,"God only accepts the repentance of those who commit evil ignorantly ˹or recklessly˺ then repent soon after—God will pardon them. And God is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  4,18,"However, repentance is not accepted from those who knowingly persist in sin until they start dying, and then cry, “Now I repent!” nor those who die as disbelievers. For them We have prepared a painful punishment"
  4,19,"O believers! It is not permissible for you to inherit women against their will or mistreat them to make them return some of the dowry ˹as a ransom for divorce˺—unless they are found guilty of adultery. Treat them fairly. If you happen to dislike them, you may hate something which God turns into a great blessing"
