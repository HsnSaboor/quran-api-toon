  9,24,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If your parents and children and siblings and spouses and extended family and the wealth you have acquired and the trade you fear will decline and the homes you cherish—˹if all these˺ are more beloved to you than God and His Messenger and struggling in His Way, then wait until God brings about His Will. God does not guide the rebellious people.”"

  9,26,"Then God sent down His reassurance upon His Messenger and the believers, and sent down forces you could not see, and punished those who disbelieved. Such was the reward of the disbelievers"
