quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,141,and distinguish the ˹true˺ believers and destroy the disbelievers
  3,142,Do you think you will enter Paradise without God proving which of you ˹truly˺ struggled ˹for His cause˺ and patiently endured
  3,143,"You certainly wished ˹for the opportunity˺ for martyrdom before encountering it, now you have seen it with your own eyes"
  3,144,"Muḥammad is no more than a messenger; other messengers have gone before him. If he were to die or to be killed, would you regress into disbelief? Those who do so will not harm God whatsoever. And God will reward those who are grateful"
  3,145,"No soul can ever die without God’s Will at the destined time. Those who desire worldly gain, We will let them have it, and those who desire heavenly reward, We will grant it to them. And We will reward those who are grateful"
  3,146,"˹Imagine˺ how many devotees fought along with their prophets and never faltered despite whatever ˹losses˺ they suffered in the cause of God, nor did they weaken or give in! God loves those who persevere"
  3,147,"And all they said was, “Our Lord! Forgive our sins and excesses, make our steps firm, and grant us victory over the disbelieving people.”"
  3,148,So God gave them the reward of this world and the excellent reward of the Hereafter. For God loves the good-doers
