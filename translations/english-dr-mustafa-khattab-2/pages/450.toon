  37,103,"Then when they submitted ˹to God’s Will˺, and Abraham laid him on the side of his forehead ˹for sacrifice˺"
  37,104,"We called out to him, “O Abraham"
  37,105,"You have already fulfilled the vision.” Indeed, this is how We reward the good-doers"
  37,106,That was truly a revealing test
  37,107,And We ransomed his son with a great sacrifice
  37,108,and blessed Abraham ˹with honourable mention˺ among later generations
  37,109,“Peace be upon Abraham.”
  37,110,This is how We reward the good-doers
  37,111,He was truly one of Our faithful servants
  37,112,"We ˹later˺ gave him good news of Isaac—a prophet, and one of the righteous"
  37,113,"We blessed him and Isaac as well. Some of their descendants did good, while others clearly wronged themselves"
  37,114,And We certainly showed favour to Moses and Aaron
  37,115,and delivered them and their people from the great distress
  37,116,We helped them so it was they who prevailed
  37,117,We gave them the clear Scripture
  37,118,and guided them to the Straight Path
  37,119,And We blessed them ˹with honourable mention˺ among later generations
  37,120,“Peace be upon Moses and Aaron.”
  37,121,"Indeed, this is how We reward the good-doers"

  37,123,And Elias was indeed one of the messengers
  37,124,"˹Remember˺ when he said to his people, “Will you not fear ˹God˺"
  37,125,Do you call upon ˹the idol of˺ Ba’l and abandon the Best of Creators—
  37,126,"God, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers?”"
