quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  22,47,They challenge you ˹O Prophet˺ to hasten the torment. And God will never fail in His promise. But a day with your Lord is indeed like a thousand years by your counting
  22,48,"Many are the societies whose end We delayed while they did wrong, then seized them. And to Me is the final return"
  22,49,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! I am only sent to you with a clear warning"
  22,50,So those who believe and do good will have forgiveness and an honourable provision
  22,51,"But those who strive to discredit Our revelations, they will be the residents of the Hellfire.”"
  22,52,"Whenever We sent a messenger or a prophet before you ˹O Prophet˺ and he recited ˹Our revelations˺, Satan would influence ˹people’s understanding of˺ his recitation. But ˹eventually˺ God would eliminate Satan’s influence. Then God would ˹firmly˺ establish His revelations. And God is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  22,53,All that so He may make Satan’s influence a trial for those ˹hypocrites˺ whose hearts are sick and those ˹disbelievers˺ whose hearts are hardened. Surely the wrongdoers are totally engrossed in opposition
  22,54,"˹This is˺ also so that those gifted with knowledge would know that this ˹revelation˺ is the truth from your Lord, so they have faith in it, and so their hearts would submit humbly to it. And God surely guides the believers to the Straight Path"
  22,55,"Yet the disbelievers will persist in doubt about this ˹revelation˺ until the Hour takes them by surprise, or the torment of a terminating Day comes to them"
