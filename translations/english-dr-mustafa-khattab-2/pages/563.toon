quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  67,13,Whether you speak secretly or openly—He surely knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart
  67,14,"How could He not know His Own creation? For He ˹alone˺ is the Most Subtle, All-Aware"
  67,15,"He is the One Who smoothed out the earth for you, so move about in its regions and eat from His provisions. And to Him is the resurrection ˹of all˺"
  67,16,Do you feel secure that the One Who is in heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you up as it quakes violently
  67,17,Or do you feel secure that the One Who is in heaven will not unleash upon you a storm of stones. Only then would you know how ˹serious˺ My warning was
  67,18,"And certainly those before them denied ˹as well˺, then how severe was My response"
  67,19,"Have they not seen the birds above them, spreading and folding their wings? None holds them up except the Most Compassionate. Indeed, He is All-Seeing of everything"
  67,20,"Also, which ˹powerless˺ force will come to your help instead of the Most Compassionate? Indeed, the disbelievers are only ˹lost˺ in delusion"
  67,21,"Or who is it that will provide for you if He withholds His provision? In fact, they persist in arrogance and aversion ˹to the truth˺"
  67,22,"Who is ˹rightly˺ guided: the one who crawls facedown or the one who walks upright on the Straight Path"
  67,23,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “He is the One Who brought you into being and gave you hearing, sight, and intellect. ˹Yet˺ you hardly give any thanks.”"
  67,24,"˹Also˺ say, “He is the One Who has dispersed you ˹all˺ over the earth, and to Him you will ˹all˺ be gathered.”"
  67,25,"˹Still˺ they ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass, if what you say is true?”"
  67,26,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “That knowledge is with God alone, and I am only sent with a clear warning.”"
