quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  68,16,We will soon mark his snout
  68,17,"Indeed, We have tested those ˹Meccans˺ as We tested the owners of the garden—when they swore they would surely harvest ˹all˺ its fruit in the early morning"
  68,18,leaving no thought for God’s Will
  68,19,Then it was struck by a torment from your Lord while they slept
  68,20,so it was reduced to ashes
  68,21,Then by daybreak they called out to each other
  68,22,"˹saying,˺ “Go early to your harvest, if you want to pick ˹all˺ the fruit.”"
  68,23,"So they went off, whispering to one another"
  68,24,“Do not let any poor person enter your garden today.”
  68,25,"And they proceeded early, totally fixated on their purpose"
  68,26,"But when they saw it ˹devastated˺, they cried, “We must have lost ˹our˺ way"
  68,27,"In fact, we have been deprived ˹of our livelihood˺.”"
  68,28,"The most sensible of them said, “Did I not urge you to say, ‘God willing.’?”"
  68,29,"They replied, “Glory be to our Lord! We have truly been wrongdoers.”"
  68,30,"Then they turned on each other, throwing blame"
  68,31,"They said, “Woe to us! We have certainly been transgressors"
  68,32,"We trust our Lord will give us a better garden than this, ˹for˺ we are indeed turning to our Lord with hope.”"
  68,33,"That is the ˹way of Our˺ punishment ˹in this world˺. But the punishment of the Hereafter is certainly far worse, if only they knew"
  68,34,"Indeed, the righteous will have the Gardens of Bliss with their Lord"
  68,35,Should We then treat those who have submitted like the wicked
  68,36,What is the matter with you? How do you judge
  68,37,"Or do you have a scripture, in which you read"
  68,38,that you will have whatever you choose
  68,39,Or do you have oaths binding on Us until the Day of Judgment that you will have whatever you decide
  68,40,Ask them ˹O Prophet˺ which of them can guarantee all that
  68,41,"Or do they have associate-gods ˹supporting this claim˺? Then let them bring forth their associate-gods, if what they say is true"
  68,42,"˹Beware of˺ the Day the Shin ˹of God˺ will be bared, and the wicked will be asked to prostrate, but they will not be able to do so"
