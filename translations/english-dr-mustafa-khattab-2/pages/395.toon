quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,78,"He replied, “I have been granted all this because of some knowledge I have.” Did he not know that God had already destroyed some from the generations before him who were far superior to him in power and greater in accumulating ˹wealth˺? There will be no need for the wicked to be asked about their sins"
  28,79,"Then he came out before his people in all his glamour. Those who desired the life of this world wished, “If only we could have something like what Korah has been given. He is truly a man of great fortune!”"
  28,80,"But those gifted with knowledge said, “Shame on you! God’s reward is far better for those who believe and do good. But none will attain this except the steadfast.”"
  28,81,"Then We caused the earth to swallow him up, along with his home. There was no one to help him against God, nor could he even help himself"
  28,82,"And those who had craved his position the previous day began to say, “Ah! It is certainly God Who gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills of His servants. Had it not been for the grace of God, He could have surely caused the earth to swallow us up! Oh, indeed! The disbelievers will never succeed.”"
  28,83,That ˹eternal˺ Home in the Hereafter We reserve ˹only˺ for those who seek neither tyranny nor corruption on the earth. The ultimate outcome belongs ˹only˺ to the righteous
  28,84,"Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded with what is better. And whoever comes with an evil deed, then the evildoers will only be rewarded for what they used to do"
