quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  18,84,"Surely We established him in the land, and gave him the means to all things"
  18,85,So he travelled a course
  18,86,"until he reached the setting ˹point˺ of the sun, which appeared to him to be setting in a spring of murky water, where he found some people. We said, “O Ⱬul-Qarnain! Either punish them or treat them kindly.”"
  18,87,"He responded, “Whoever does wrong will be punished by us, then will be returned to their Lord, Who will punish them with a horrible torment"
  18,88,"As for those who believe and do good, they will have the finest reward, and we will assign them easy commands.”"
  18,89,Then he travelled a ˹different˺ course
  18,90,until he reached the rising ˹point˺ of the sun. He found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shelter from it
  18,91,So it was. And We truly had full knowledge of him
  18,92,Then he travelled a ˹third˺ course
  18,93,until he reached ˹a pass˺ between two mountains. He found in front of them a people who could hardly understand ˹his˺ language
  18,94,"They pleaded, “O Ⱬul-Qarnain! Surely Gog and Magog are spreading corruption throughout the land. Should we pay you tribute, provided that you build a wall between us and them?”"
  18,95,"He responded, “What my Lord has provided for me is far better. But assist me with resources, and I will build a barrier between you and them"
  18,96,"Bring me blocks of iron!” Then, when he had filled up ˹the gap˺ between the two mountains, he ordered, “Blow!” When the iron became red hot, he said, “Bring me molten copper to pour over it.”"
  18,97,And so the enemies could neither scale nor tunnel through it
