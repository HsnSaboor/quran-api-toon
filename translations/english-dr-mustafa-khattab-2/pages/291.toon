quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  17,87,"had it not been for the mercy of your Lord. Indeed, His favour upon you is immense"
  17,88,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If ˹all˺ humans and jinn were to come together to produce the equivalent of this Quran, they could not produce its equal, no matter how they supported each other.”"
  17,89,"And We have truly set forth every ˹kind of˺ lesson for humanity in this Quran, yet most people persist in disbelief"
  17,90,"They challenge ˹the Prophet˺, “We will never believe in you until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us"
  17,91,"or until you have a garden of palm trees and vineyards, and cause rivers to flow abundantly in it"
  17,92,"or cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces, as you have claimed, or bring God and the angels before us, face to face"
  17,93,"or until you have a house of gold, or you ascend into heaven—and even then we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book that we can read.” Say, “Glory be to my Lord! Am I not only a human messenger?”"
  17,94,"And nothing has prevented people from believing when guidance comes to them except their protest: “Has God sent a human as a messenger?”"
  17,95,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Had there been angels walking the earth, well settled, We would have surely sent down for them an angel from heaven as a messenger.”"
  17,96,"Say, “Sufficient is God as a Witness between me and you. He is certainly All-Knowing, All-Seeing of His servants.”"
