quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun is put out
  81,2,and when the stars fall down
  81,3,and when the mountains are blown away
  81,4,and when pregnant camels are left untended
  81,5,and when wild beasts are gathered together
  81,6,and when the seas are set on fire
  81,7,and when the souls ˹and their bodies˺ are paired ˹once more˺
  81,8,"and when baby girls, buried alive, are asked"
  81,9,for what crime they were put to death
  81,10,and when the records ˹of deeds˺ are laid open
  81,11,and when the sky is stripped away
  81,12,and when the Hellfire is fiercely flared up
  81,13,and when Paradise is brought near—
  81,14,˹on that Day˺ each soul will know what ˹deeds˺ it has brought along
  81,15,I do swear by the receding stars
  81,16,which travel and hide
  81,17,and the night as it falls
  81,18,and the day as it breaks
  81,19,"Indeed, this ˹Quran˺ is the Word of ˹God delivered by Gabriel,˺ a noble messenger-angel"
  81,20,"full of power, held in honour by the Lord of the Throne"
  81,21,"obeyed there ˹in heaven˺, and trustworthy"
  81,22,And your fellow man is not insane
  81,23,And he did see that ˹angel˺ on the clear horizon
  81,24,and he does not withhold ˹what is revealed to him of˺ the unseen
  81,25,And this ˹Quran˺ is not the word of an outcast devil
  81,26,So what ˹other˺ path would you take
  81,27,Surely this ˹Quran˺ is only a reminder to the whole world—
  81,28,to whoever of you wills to take the Straight Way
  81,29,"But you cannot will ˹to do so˺, except by the Will of God, the Lord of all worlds"
