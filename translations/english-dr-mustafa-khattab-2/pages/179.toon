quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  8,17,"It was not you ˹believers˺ who killed them, but it was God Who did so. Nor was it you ˹O Prophet˺ who threw ˹a handful of sand at the disbelievers˺, but it was God Who did so, rendering the believers a great favour. Surely God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
  8,18,"As such, God frustrates the evil plans of the disbelievers"
  8,19,"If you ˹Meccans˺ sought judgment, now it has come to you. And if you cease, it will be for your own good. But if you persist, We will persist. And your forces—no matter how numerous they might be—will not benefit you whatsoever. For God is certainly with the believers"
  8,20,O believers! Obey God and His Messenger and do not turn away from him while you hear ˹his call˺
  8,21,"Do not be like those who say, “We hear,” but in fact they are not listening"
  8,22,"Indeed, the worst of all beings in the sight of God are the ˹wilfully˺ deaf and dumb, who do not understand"
  8,23,"Had God known any goodness in them, He would have certainly made them hear. ˹But˺ even if He had made them hear, they would have surely turned away heedlessly"
  8,24,"O believers! Respond to God and His Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life. And know that God stands between a person and their heart, and that to Him you will all be gathered"
  8,25,Beware of a trial that will not only affect the wrongdoers among you. And know that God is severe in punishment
