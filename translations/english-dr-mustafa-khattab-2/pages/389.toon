quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,29,"When Moses had completed the term and was travelling with his family, he spotted a fire on the side of Mount Ṭûr. He said to his family, “Stay here, ˹for˺ I have spotted a fire. Perhaps from there I can bring you some directions or a torch from the fire so you may warm yourselves.”"
  28,30,"But when he came to it, he was called from the bush in the sacred ground to the right side of the valley: “O Moses! It is truly I. I am God—the Lord of all worlds"
  28,31,"Now, throw down your staff!” But when he saw it slithering like a snake, he ran away without looking back. ˹God reassured him,˺ “O Moses! Draw near, and have no fear. You are perfectly secure"
  28,32,"Now put your hand through ˹the opening of˺ your collar, it will come out ˹shining˺ white, unblemished. And cross your arms tightly to calm your fears. These are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. They have truly been a rebellious people.”"
  28,33,"Moses appealed, “My Lord! I have indeed killed a man from them, so I fear they may kill me"
  28,34,"And my brother Aaron is more eloquent than I, so send him with me as a helper to support what I say, for I truly fear they may reject me.”"
  28,35,"God responded, “We will assist you with your brother and grant you both authority, so they cannot harm you. With Our signs, you and those who follow you will ˹certainly˺ prevail.”"
