quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,44,God alternates the day and night. Surely in this is a lesson for people of insight
  24,45,"And God has created from water every living creature. Some of them crawl on their bellies, some walk on two legs, and some walk on four. God creates whatever He wills. Surely God is Most Capable of everything"
  24,46,We have indeed sent down revelations clarifying ˹the truth˺. But God ˹only˺ guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path
  24,47,"And the hypocrites say, “We believe in God and the Messenger, and we obey.” Then a group of them turns away soon after that. These are not ˹true˺ believers"
  24,48,"And as soon as they are called to God and His Messenger so he may judge between them, a group of them turns away"
  24,49,"But if the truth is in their favour, they come to him, fully submitting"
  24,50,"Is there a sickness in their hearts? Or are they in doubt? Or do they fear that God and His Messenger will be unjust to them? In fact, it is they who are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers"
  24,51,"The only response of the ˹true˺ believers, when they are called to God and His Messenger so he may judge between them, is to say, “We hear and obey.” It is they who will ˹truly˺ succeed"
  24,52,"For whoever obeys God and His Messenger, and fears God and is mindful of Him, then it is they who will ˹truly˺ triumph"
  24,53,"They swear by God their most solemn oaths that if you ˹O Prophet˺ were to command them, they would certainly march forth ˹in God’s cause˺. Say, “˹You˺ do not ˹have to˺ swear; your obedience is well known!” Surely God is All-Aware of what you do.”"
