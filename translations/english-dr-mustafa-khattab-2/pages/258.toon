quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  14,19,"Have you not seen that God created the heavens and the earth for a reason? If He wills, He can eliminate you and produce a new creation"
  14,20,And that is not difficult for God ˹at all˺
  14,21,"They will all appear before God, and the lowly ˹followers˺ will appeal to the arrogant ˹leaders˺, “We were your ˹dedicated˺ followers, so will you ˹then˺ protect us from God’s torment in any way?” They will reply, “Had God guided us, we would have guided you. ˹Now˺ it is all the same for us whether we suffer patiently or impatiently, there is no escape for us.”"
  14,22,"And Satan will say ˹to his followers˺ after the judgment has been passed, “Indeed, God has made you a true promise. I too made you a promise, but I failed you. I did not have any authority over you. I only called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; blame yourselves. I cannot save you, nor can you save me. Indeed, I denounce your previous association of me with God ˹in loyalty˺. Surely the wrongdoers will suffer a painful punishment.”"
  14,23,"Those who believe and do good will be admitted into Gardens, under which rivers flow—to stay there forever by the Will of their Lord—where they will be greeted with “Peace!”"
  14,24,Do you not see how God compares a good word to a good tree? Its root is firm and its branches reach the sky
