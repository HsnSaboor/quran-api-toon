  3,166,"So what you suffered on the day the two armies met was by God’s Will, so that He might distinguish the ˹true˺ believers"
  3,167,"and expose the hypocrites. When it was said to them, “Come fight in the cause of God or ˹at least˺ defend yourselves,” they replied, “If we had known there was fighting, we would have definitely gone with you.” They were closer to disbelief than to belief on that day—for saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts. God is All-Knowing of what they hide"
  3,168,"Those who sat at home, saying about their brothers, “Had they listened to us, they would not have been killed.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Try not to die if what you say is true!”"
  3,169,"Never think of those martyred in the cause of God as dead. In fact, they are alive with their Lord, well provided for—"
  3,170,"rejoicing in God’s bounties and being delighted for those yet to join them. There will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve"
  3,171,"They are joyful for receiving God’s grace and bounty, and that God does not deny the reward of the believers"
  3,172,"˹As for˺ those who responded to the call of God and His Messenger after their injury, those of them who did good and were mindful ˹of God˺ will have a great reward"
  3,173,"Those who were warned, “Your enemies have mobilized their forces against you, so fear them,” the warning only made them grow stronger in faith and they replied, “God ˹alone˺ is sufficient ˹as an aid˺ for us and ˹He˺ is the best Protector.”"
