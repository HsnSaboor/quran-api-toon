  58,13,"Are you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultations ˹with him˺? Since you are unable to do so, and God has turned to you in mercy, then ˹continue to˺ establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and obey God and His Messenger. And God is All-Aware of what you do"
  58,14,Have you not seen those ˹hypocrites˺ who ally themselves with a people with whom God is displeased? They are neither with you nor with them. And they swear to lies knowingly

  58,16,"They have made their ˹false˺ oaths as a shield, hindering ˹others˺ from the cause of God. So they will suffer a humiliating punishment"
