quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and turned ˹his attention˺ away
  80,2,˹simply˺ because the blind man came to him ˹interrupting˺
  80,3,"You never know ˹O Prophet˺, perhaps he may be purified"
  80,4,"or he may be mindful, benefitting from the reminder"
  80,5,As for the one who was indifferent
  80,6,you gave him your ˹undivided˺ attention
  80,7,even though you are not to blame if he would not be purified
  80,8,"But as for the one who came to you, eager ˹to learn˺"
  80,9,being in awe ˹of God˺
  80,10,you were inattentive to him
  80,11,But no! This ˹revelation˺ is truly a reminder
  80,12,So let whoever wills be mindful of it
  80,13,It is ˹written˺ on pages held in honour—
  80,14,"highly esteemed, purified—"
  80,15,by the hands of angel-scribes
  80,16,honourable and virtuous
  80,17,Condemned are ˹disbelieving˺ humans! How ungrateful they are ˹to God˺
  80,18,From what substance did He create them
  80,19,"He created them from a sperm-drop, and ordained their development"
  80,20,Then He makes the way easy for them
  80,21,then causes them to die and be buried
  80,22,"Then when He wills, He will resurrect them"
  80,23,But no! They have failed to comply with what He ordered
  80,24,Let people then consider their food
  80,25,how We pour down rain in abundance
  80,26,and meticulously split the earth open ˹for sprouts˺
  80,27,causing grain to grow in it
  80,28,as well as grapes and greens
  80,29,and olives and palm trees
  80,30,and dense orchards
  80,31,and fruit and fodder—
  80,32,all as ˹a means of˺ sustenance for you and your animals
  80,33,"Then, when the Deafening Blast comes to pass—"
  80,34,on that Day every person will flee from their own siblings
  80,35,and ˹even˺ their mother and father
  80,36,and ˹even˺ their spouse and children
  80,37,For then everyone will have enough concern of their own
  80,38,On that Day ˹some˺ faces will be bright
  80,39,laughing and rejoicing
  80,40,while ˹other˺ faces will be dusty
  80,41,cast in gloom—
  80,42,"those are the disbelievers, the ˹wicked˺ sinners"
