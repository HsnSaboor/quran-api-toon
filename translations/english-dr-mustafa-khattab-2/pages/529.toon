quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  54,7,"With eyes downcast, they will come forth from the graves as if they were swarming locusts"
  54,8,"rushing towards the caller. The disbelievers will cry, “This is a difficult Day!”"
  54,9,"Before them, the people of Noah denied ˹the truth˺ and rejected Our servant, calling ˹him˺ insane. And he was intimidated"
  54,10,"So he cried out to his Lord, “I am helpless, so help ˹me˺!”"
  54,11,So We opened the gates of the sky with pouring rain
  54,12,"and caused the earth to burst with springs, so the waters met for a fate already set"
  54,13,We carried him on that ˹Ark made˺ of planks and nails
  54,14,sailing under Our ˹watchful˺ Eyes—a ˹fair˺ punishment on behalf of the one ˹they˺ denied
  54,15,We certainly left this as a sign. So is there anyone who will be mindful
  54,16,Then how ˹dreadful˺ were My punishment and warnings
  54,17,And We have certainly made the Quran easy to remember. So is there anyone who will be mindful
  54,18,’Ȃd ˹also˺ rejected ˹the truth˺. Then how ˹dreadful˺ were My punishment and warnings
  54,19,"Indeed, We sent against them a furious wind, on a day of unrelenting misery"
  54,20,"that snatched people up, leaving them like trunks of uprooted palm trees"
  54,21,Then how ˹dreadful˺ were My punishment and warnings
  54,22,And We have certainly made the Quran easy to remember. So is there anyone who will be mindful
  54,23,Thamûd rejected the warnings ˹as well˺
  54,24,"arguing, “How can we follow one ˹average˺ human being from among us? We would then truly be misguided and insane"
  54,25,"Has the revelation been sent down ˹only˺ to him out of ˹all of˺ us? In fact, he is a boastful liar.”"
  54,26,"˹It was revealed to Ṣâliḥ,˺ “They will soon know who the boastful liar is"
  54,27,"We are sending the she-camel as a test for them. So watch them ˹closely˺, and have patience"
