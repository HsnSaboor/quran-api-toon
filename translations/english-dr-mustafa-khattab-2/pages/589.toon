quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,"as they sit on ˹canopied˺ couches, looking on"
  83,36,"˹The believers will be asked,˺ “Have the disbelievers ˹not˺ been paid back for what they used to do?”"
  84,1,When the sky bursts open
  84,2,obeying its Lord as it must
  84,3,and when the earth is flattened out
  84,4,and ejects ˹all˺ its contents and becomes empty
  84,5,"obeying its Lord as it must, ˹surely you will all be judged˺"
  84,6,"O humanity! Indeed, you are labouring restlessly towards your Lord, and will ˹eventually˺ meet the consequences"
  84,7,As for those who are given their record in their right hand
  84,8,they will have an easy reckoning
  84,9,and will return to their people joyfully
  84,10,And as for those who are given their record ˹in their left hand˺ from behind their backs
  84,11,they will cry for ˹instant˺ destruction
  84,12,and will burn in the blazing Fire
  84,13,For they used to be prideful among their people
  84,14,thinking they would never return ˹to God˺
  84,15,Yes ˹they would˺! Surely their Lord has always been All-Seeing of them
  84,16,"So, I do swear by the twilight"
  84,17,And by the night and whatever it envelops
  84,18,And by the moon when it waxes full
  84,19,You will certainly pass from one state to another
  84,20,So what is the matter with them that they do not believe
  84,21,"and when the Quran is recited to them, they do not bow down ˹in submission˺"
  84,22,"In fact, the disbelievers persist in denial"
  84,23,But God knows best whatever they hide
  84,24,So give them good news of a painful punishment
  84,25,But those who believe and do good will have a never-ending reward
