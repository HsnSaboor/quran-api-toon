quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the dawn
  89,2,and the ten nights
  89,3,and the even and the odd
  89,4,and the night when it passes
  89,5,Is all this ˹not˺ a sufficient oath for those who have sense
  89,6,Did you not see how your Lord dealt with ’Ȃd—
  89,7,˹the people˺ of Iram—with ˹their˺ great stature
  89,8,unmatched in any other land
  89,9,and Thamûd who carved ˹their homes into˺ the rocks in the ˹Stone˺ Valley
  89,10,and the Pharaoh of mighty structures
  89,11,They all transgressed throughout the land
  89,12,spreading much corruption there
  89,13,So your Lord unleashed on them a scourge of punishment
  89,14,˹For˺ your Lord is truly vigilant
  89,15,"Now, whenever a human being is tested by their Lord through ˹His˺ generosity and blessings, they boast, “My Lord has ˹deservedly˺ honoured me!”"
  89,16,"But when He tests them by limiting their provision, they protest, “My Lord has ˹undeservedly˺ humiliated me!”"
  89,17,"Absolutely not! In fact, you are not ˹even˺ gracious to the orphan"
  89,18,nor do you urge one another to feed the poor
  89,19,And you devour ˹others’˺ inheritance greedily
  89,20,and love wealth fervently
  89,21,Enough! When the earth is entirely crushed over and over
  89,22,"and your Lord comes ˹to judge˺ with angels, rank upon rank"
  89,23,and Hell is brought forth on that Day—this is when every ˹disbelieving˺ person will remember ˹their own sins˺. But what is the use of remembering then
