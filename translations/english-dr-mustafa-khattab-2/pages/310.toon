quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  19,65,"˹He is the˺ Lord of the heavens, and the earth, and everything in between. So worship Him ˹alone˺, and be steadfast in His worship. Do you know of anyone equal to Him ˹in His attributes˺?”"
  19,66,"Yet ˹some˺ people ask ˹mockingly˺, “After I die, will I really be raised to life again?”"
  19,67,"Do ˹such˺ people not remember that We created them before, when they were nothing"
  19,68,"By your Lord ˹O Prophet˺! We will surely gather them along with the devils, and then set them around Hell on their knees"
  19,69,Then We will certainly begin by dragging out of every group the ones most defiant to the Most Compassionate
  19,70,And We truly know best who is most deserving of burning in it
  19,71,There is none of you who will not pass over it. ˹This is˺ a decree your Lord must fulfil
  19,72,"Then We will deliver those who were devout, leaving the wrongdoers there on their knees"
  19,73,"When Our clear revelations are recited to them, the disbelievers ask the believers ˹mockingly˺, “Which of the two of us is better in status and superior in assembly?”"
  19,74,"˹Imagine, O Prophet˺ how many peoples We have destroyed before them, who were far better in luxury and splendour"
  19,75,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Whoever is ˹entrenched˺ in misguidance, the Most Compassionate will allow them plenty of time, until—behold!—they face what they are threatened with: either the torment or the Hour. Only then will they realize who is worse in position and inferior in manpower.”"
  19,76,And God increases in guidance those who are ˹rightly˺ guided. And the everlasting good deeds are far better with your Lord in reward and in outcome
