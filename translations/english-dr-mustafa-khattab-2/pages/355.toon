quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  24,37,"by men who are not distracted—either by buying or selling—from God’s remembrance, or performing prayer, or paying alms-tax. They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will tremble"
  24,38,"˹hoping˺ that God may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and increase them out of His grace. And God provides for whoever He wills without limit"
  24,39,"As for the disbelievers, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert, which the thirsty perceive as water, but when they approach it, they find it to be nothing. Instead, they find God there ˹in the Hereafter, ready˺ to settle their account. And God is swift in reckoning"
  24,40,"Or ˹their deeds are˺ like the darkness in a deep sea, covered by waves upon waves, topped by ˹dark˺ clouds. Darkness upon darkness! If one stretches out their hand, they can hardly see it. And whoever God does not bless with light will have no light"
  24,41,"Do you not see that God is glorified by all those in the heavens and the earth, even the birds as they soar? Each ˹instinctively˺ knows their manner of prayer and glorification. And God has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all they do"
  24,42,To God ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And to God is the final return
  24,43,"Do you not see that God gently drives the clouds, then joins them together, piling them up into masses, from which you see raindrops come forth? And He sends down from the sky mountains ˹of clouds˺ loaded with hail, pouring it on whoever He wills and averting it from whoever He wills. The flash of the clouds’ lightning nearly takes away eyesight"
