  7,164,"When some of ˹the righteous among˺ them questioned ˹their fellow Sabbath-keepers˺, “Why do you ˹bother to˺ warn those ˹Sabbath-breakers˺ who will either be destroyed or severely punished by God?” They replied, “Just to be free from your Lord’s blame, and so perhaps they may abstain.”"

But the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of God˺. Will you not then understand"
  7,170,As for those who firmly abide by the Scripture and establish prayer—surely We never discount the reward of those acting righteously
