quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  12,70,"When Joseph had provided them with supplies, he slipped the royal cup into his brother’s bag. Then a herald cried, “O people of the caravan! You must be thieves!”"
  12,71,"They asked, turning back, “What have you lost?”"
  12,72,"The herald ˹along with the guards˺ replied, “We have lost the King’s measuring cup. And whoever brings it will be awarded a camel-load ˹of grain˺. I guarantee it.”"
  12,73,"Joseph’s brothers replied, “By God! You know well that we did not come to cause trouble in the land, nor are we thieves.”"
  12,74,"Joseph’s men asked, “What should be the price for theft, if you are lying?”"
  12,75,"Joseph’s brothers responded, “The price will be ˹the enslavement of˺ the one in whose bag the cup is found. That is how we punish the wrongdoers.”"
  12,76,"Joseph began searching their bags before that of his brother ˹Benjamin˺, then brought it out of Benjamin’s bag. This is how We inspired Joseph to plan. He could not have taken his brother under the King’s law, but God had so willed. We elevate in rank whoever We will. But above those ranking in knowledge is the One All-Knowing"
  12,77,"˹To distance themselves,˺ Joseph’s brothers argued, “If he has stolen, so did his ˹full˺ brother before.” But Joseph suppressed his outrage—revealing nothing to them—and said ˹to himself˺, “You are in such an evil position, and God knows best ˹the truth of˺ what you claim.”"
  12,78,"They appealed, “O Chief Minister! He has a very old father, so take one of us instead. We surely see you as one of the good-doers.”"
