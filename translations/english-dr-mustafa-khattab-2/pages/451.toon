quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"But they rejected him, so they will certainly be brought ˹for punishment˺"
  37,128,But not the chosen servants of God
  37,129,We blessed him ˹with honourable mention˺ among later generations
  37,130,“Peace be upon Elias.”
  37,131,"Indeed, this is how We reward the good-doers"
  37,132,He was truly one of Our faithful servants
  37,133,And Lot was indeed one of the messengers
  37,134,˹Remember˺ when We delivered him and all of his family
  37,135,"except an old woman, who was one of the doomed"
  37,136,Then We ˹utterly˺ destroyed the rest
  37,137,You ˹Meccans˺ certainly pass by their ruins day
  37,138,and night. Will you not then understand
  37,139,And Jonah was indeed one of the messengers
  37,140,˹Remember˺ when he fled to the overloaded ship
  37,141,"Then ˹to save it from sinking,˺ he drew straws ˹with other passengers˺. He lost ˹and was thrown overboard˺"
  37,142,Then the whale engulfed him while he was blameworthy
  37,143,Had he not ˹constantly˺ glorified ˹God˺
  37,144,he would have certainly remained in its belly until the Day of Resurrection
  37,145,"But We cast him onto the open ˹shore˺, ˹totally˺ worn out"
  37,146,and caused a squash plant to grow over him
  37,147,We ˹later˺ sent him ˹back˺ to ˹his city of˺ at least one hundred thousand people
  37,148,"who then believed ˹in him˺, so We allowed them enjoyment for a while"
  37,149,"Ask them ˹O Prophet˺ if your Lord has daughters, while the pagans ˹prefer to˺ have sons"
  37,150,Or ˹ask them˺ if We created the angels as females right before their eyes
  37,151,"Indeed, it is one of their ˹outrageous˺ fabrications to say"
  37,152,“God has children.” They are simply liars
  37,153,Has He chosen daughters over sons
