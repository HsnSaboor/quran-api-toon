quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  27,45,"And We certainly sent to the people of Thamûd their brother Ṣâliḥ, proclaiming, “Worship God,” but they suddenly split into two opposing groups"
  27,46,"He urged ˹the disbelieving group˺, “O my people! Why do you ˹seek to˺ hasten the torment rather than grace? If only you sought God’s forgiveness so you may be shown mercy!”"
  27,47,"They replied, “You and your followers are a bad omen for us.” He responded, “Your omens are destined by God. In fact, you are ˹only˺ a people being tested.”"
  27,48,"And there were in the city nine ˹elite˺ men who spread corruption in the land, never doing what is right"
  27,49,"They vowed, “Let us swear by God that we will take him and his family down by night. Then we will certainly say to his ˹closest˺ heirs, ‘We did not witness the murder of his family. We are definitely telling the truth.’”"
  27,50,"And ˹so˺ they made a plan, but We too made a plan, while they were unaware"
  27,51,"See then what the consequences of their plan were: We ˹utterly˺ destroyed them and their people all together"
  27,52,"So their homes are there, ˹but completely˺ ruined because of their wrongdoing. Surely in this is a lesson for people of knowledge"
  27,53,And We delivered those who were faithful and were mindful ˹of God˺
  27,54,"And ˹remember˺ Lot, when he rebuked ˹the men of˺ his people, “Do you commit that shameful deed while you can see ˹one another˺"
  27,55,"Do you really lust after men instead of women? In fact, you are ˹only˺ a people acting ignorantly.”"
