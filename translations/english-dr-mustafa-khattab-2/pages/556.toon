quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  64,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth ˹constantly˺ glorifies God. The kingdom is His, and all praise is for Him. For He is Most Capable of everything"
  64,2,"He is the One Who created you, yet some of you are disbelievers while some are believers. And God is All-Seeing of what you do"
  64,3,"He created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. He shaped you ˹in the womb˺, perfecting your form. And to Him is the final return"
  64,4,He knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth. And He knows whatever you conceal and whatever you reveal. For God knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart
  64,5,"Have the stories of those who disbelieved before not reached you ˹pagans˺? They tasted the evil consequences of their doings, and they will suffer a painful punishment"
  64,6,"That was because their messengers used to come to them with clear proofs, but they said ˹mockingly˺, “How can humans be our guides?” So they persisted in disbelief and turned away. And God was not in need ˹of their faith˺. For God is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy"
  64,7,"The disbelievers claim they will not be resurrected. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Yes, by my Lord, you will surely be resurrected, then you will certainly be informed of what you have done. And that is easy for God.”"
  64,8,So believe in God and His Messenger and in the Light We have revealed. And God is All-Aware of what you do
  64,9,"˹Consider˺ the Day He will gather you ˹all˺ for the Day of Gathering—that will be the Day of mutual loss and gain. So whoever believes in God and does good, He will absolve them of their sins and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. That is the ultimate triumph"
