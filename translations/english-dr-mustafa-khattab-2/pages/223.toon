quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,13,"Or do they say, “He has fabricated this ˹Quran˺!”? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Produce ten fabricated sûrahs like it and seek help from whoever you can—other than God—if what you say is true!”"
  11,14,"But if your helpers fail you, then know that it has been revealed with the knowledge of God, and that there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him! Will you ˹not˺ then submit ˹to God˺"
  11,15,"Whoever desires ˹only˺ this worldly life and its luxuries, We will pay them in full for their deeds in this life—nothing will be left out"
  11,16,It is they who will have nothing in the Hereafter except the Fire. Their efforts in this life will be fruitless and their deeds will be useless
  11,17,"˹Can these people be compared to˺ those ˹believers˺ who stand on clear proof from their Lord, backed by ˹the Quran as˺ a witness from Him, and preceded by the Book of Moses ˹which was revealed˺ as a guide and mercy? It is those ˹believers˺ who have faith in it. But whoever from the ˹disbelieving˺ groups rejects it, the Fire will be their destiny. So do not be in doubt of it. It is certainly the truth from your Lord, but most people do not believe"
  11,18,"Who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against God? They will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, “These are the ones who lied against their Lord.” Surely God’s condemnation is upon the wrongdoers"
  11,19,"who hinder ˹others˺ from God’s Path, striving to make it ˹appear˺ crooked, and disbelieve in the Hereafter"
