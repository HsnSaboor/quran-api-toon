quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"And the believers say, “If only a sûrah was revealed ˹allowing self-defence˺!” Yet when a precise sûrah is revealed, in which fighting is ˹explicitly˺ mentioned, you see those with sickness in their hearts staring at you like someone in the throes of death. It would have been better for them"
  47,21,"to obey and speak rightly. Then when fighting was ordained, it surely would have been better for them if they were true to God"
  47,22,"Now if you ˹hypocrites˺ turn away, perhaps you would then spread corruption throughout the land and sever your ˹ties of˺ kinship"
  47,23,"These are the ones who God has condemned, deafening them and blinding their eyes"
  47,24,Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Or are there locks upon their hearts
  47,25,"Indeed, those who relapse ˹into disbelief˺ after ˹true˺ guidance has become clear to them, ˹it is˺ Satan ˹that˺ has tempted them, luring them with false hopes"
  47,26,"That is because they said ˹privately˺ to those who ˹also˺ detest what God has revealed, “We will obey you in some matters.” But God ˹fully˺ knows what they are hiding"
  47,27,"Then how ˹horrible˺ will it be when the angels take their souls, beating their faces and backs"
  47,28,"This is because they follow whatever displeases God and hate whatever pleases Him, so He has rendered their deeds void"
  47,29,Or do those with sickness in their hearts think that God will not ˹be able to˺ expose their malice
