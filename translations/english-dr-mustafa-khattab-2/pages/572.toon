quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  72,1,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “It has been revealed to me that a group of jinn listened ˹to the Quran,˺ and said ˹to their fellow jinn˺: ‘Indeed, we have heard a wondrous recitation"
  72,2,"It leads to Right Guidance so we believed in it, and we will never associate anyone with our Lord ˹in worship˺"
  72,3,"˹Now, we believe that˺ our Lord—Exalted is His Majesty—has neither taken a mate nor offspring"
  72,4,and that the foolish of us used to utter ˹outrageous˺ falsehoods about God
  72,5,We certainly thought that humans and jinn would never speak lies about God
  72,6,And some men used to seek refuge with some jinn—so they increased each other in wickedness
  72,7,"And those ˹humans˺ thought, just like you ˹jinn˺, that God would not resurrect anyone ˹for judgment˺"
  72,8,"˹Earlier˺ we tried to reach heaven ˹for news˺, only to find it filled with stern guards and shooting stars"
  72,9,"We used to take up positions there for eavesdropping, but whoever dares eavesdrop now will find a flare lying in wait for them"
  72,10,"Now, we have no clue whether evil is intended for those on earth, or their Lord intends for them what is right"
  72,11,Among us are those who are righteous and those who are less so. We have been of different factions
  72,12,"˹Now,˺ we truly know that we cannot frustrate God on earth, nor can we escape from Him ˹into heaven˺"
  72,13,"When we heard the guidance ˹of the Quran˺, we ˹readily˺ believed in it. For whoever believes in their Lord will have no fear of being denied ˹a reward˺ or wronged"
