quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Can any of your associate-gods originate creation and then resurrect it?” Say, “˹Only˺ God originates creation and then resurrects it. How can you then be deluded ˹from the truth˺?”"
  10,35,"Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Can any of your associate-gods guide to the truth?” Say, “˹Only˺ God guides to the truth.” Who then is more worthy to be followed: the One Who guides to the truth or those who cannot find the way unless guided? What is the matter with you? How do you judge"
  10,36,Most of them follow nothing but ˹inherited˺ assumptions. ˹And˺ surely assumptions can in no way replace the truth. God is indeed All-Knowing of what they do
  10,37,"It is not ˹possible˺ for this Quran to have been produced by anyone other than God. In fact, it is a confirmation of what came before, and an explanation of the Scripture. It is, without a doubt, from the Lord of all worlds"
  10,38,"Or do they claim, “He made it up!”? Tell them ˹O Prophet˺, “Produce one sûrah like it then, and seek help from whoever you can—other than God—if what you say is true!”"
  10,39,"In fact, they ˹hastily˺ rejected the Book without comprehending it and before the fulfilment of its warnings. Similarly, those before them were in denial. See then what was the end of the wrongdoers"
  10,40,Some of them will ˹eventually˺ believe in it; others will not. And your Lord knows best the corruptors
  10,41,"If they deny you, then say, “My deeds are mine and your deeds are yours. You are free of what I do and I am free of what you do!”"
  10,42,"Some of them listen to what you say, but can you make the deaf hear even though they do not understand"
