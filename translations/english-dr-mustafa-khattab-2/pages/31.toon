quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,197,"˹Commitment to˺ pilgrimage is made in appointed months. Whoever commits to ˹performing˺ pilgrimage, let them stay away from intimate relations, foul language, and arguments during pilgrimage. Whatever good you do, God ˹fully˺ knows of it. Take ˹necessary˺ provisions ˹for the journey˺—surely the best provision is righteousness. And be mindful of Me, O people of reason"
  2,198,"There is no blame on you for seeking the bounty of your Lord ˹during this journey˺. When you return from ’Arafât, praise God near the sacred place and praise Him for having guided you, for surely before this ˹guidance˺ you were astray"
  2,199,"Then go forth with the rest of the pilgrims. And seek God’s forgiveness. Surely God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  2,200,"When you have fulfilled your sacred rites, praise God as you used to praise your forefathers ˹before Islam˺, or even more passionately. There are some who say, “Our Lord! Grant us ˹Your bounties˺ in this world,” but they will have no share in the Hereafter"
  2,201,"Yet there are others who say, “Our Lord! Grant us the good of this world and the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire.”"
  2,202,It is they who will receive a ˹heavenly˺ reward for the good they have done. Surely God is swift in reckoning
