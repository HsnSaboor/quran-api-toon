quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,25,"˹Then they will be asked,˺ “What is the matter with you that you can no longer help each other?”"
  37,26,"In fact, on that Day they will be ˹fully˺ submissive"
  37,27,"They will turn on each other, throwing blame"
  37,28,"The misled will say, “It was you who deluded us away from what is right.”"
  37,29,"The misleaders will reply, “No! You disbelieved on your own"
  37,30,"We had no authority over you. In fact, you yourselves were a transgressing people"
  37,31,"The decree of our Lord has come to pass against us ˹all˺: we will certainly taste ˹the punishment˺"
  37,32,"We caused you to deviate, for we ourselves were deviant.”"
  37,33,Surely on that Day they will ˹all˺ share in the punishment
  37,34,That is certainly how We deal with the wicked
  37,35,"For whenever it was said to them ˹in the world˺, “There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except God,” they acted arrogantly"
  37,36,"and argued, “Should we really abandon our gods for a mad poet?”"
  37,37,"In fact, he came with the truth, confirming ˹earlier˺ messengers"
  37,38,You will certainly taste the painful torment
  37,39,and will only be rewarded for what you used to do
  37,40,But not the chosen servants of God
  37,41,They will have a known provision
  37,42,fruits ˹of every type˺. And they will be honoured
  37,43,in the Gardens of Bliss
  37,44,facing each other on thrones
  37,45,A drink ˹of pure wine˺ will be passed around to them from a flowing stream
  37,46,"crystal-white, delicious to drink"
  37,47,"It will neither harm ˹them˺, nor will they be intoxicated by it"
  37,48,And with them will be maidens of modest gaze and gorgeous eyes
  37,49,as if they were pristine pearls
  37,50,Then they will turn to one another inquisitively
  37,51,"One of them will say, “I once had a companion ˹in the world˺"
