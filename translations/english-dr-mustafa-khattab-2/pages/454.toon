quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,17,"Be patient ˹O Prophet˺ with what they say. And remember Our servant, David, the man of strength. Indeed, he ˹constantly˺ turned ˹to God˺"
  38,18,We truly subjected the mountains to hymn ˹Our praises˺ along with him in the evening and after sunrise
  38,19,"And ˹We subjected˺ the birds, flocking together. All turned to him ˹echoing his hymns˺"
  38,20,"We strengthened his kingship, and gave him wisdom and sound judgment"
  38,21,"Has the story of the two plaintiffs, who scaled the ˹wall of David’s˺ sanctuary, reached you ˹O Prophet˺"
  38,22,"When they came into David’s presence, he was startled by them. They said, “Have no fear. ˹We are merely˺ two in a dispute: one of us has wronged the other. So judge between us with truth—do not go beyond ˹it˺—and guide us to the right way"
  38,23,"This is my brother. He has ninety-nine sheep while I have ˹only˺ one. ˹Still˺ he asked me to give it up to him, overwhelming me with ˹his˺ argument.”"
  38,24,"David ˹eventually˺ ruled, “He has definitely wronged you in demanding ˹to add˺ your sheep to his. And certainly many partners wrong each other, except those who believe and do good—but how few are they!” Then David realized that We had tested him so he asked for his Lord’s forgiveness, fell down in prostration, and turned ˹to Him in repentance˺"
  38,25,So We forgave that for him. And he will indeed have ˹a status of˺ closeness to Us and an honourable destination
  38,26,"˹We instructed him:˺ “O David! We have surely made you an authority in the land, so judge between people with truth. And do not follow ˹your˺ desires or they will lead you astray from God’s Way. Surely those who go astray from God’s Way will suffer a severe punishment for neglecting the Day of Reckoning.”"
