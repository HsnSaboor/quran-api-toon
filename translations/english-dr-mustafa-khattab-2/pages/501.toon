quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  45,23,"Have you seen ˹O Prophet˺ those who have taken their own desires as their god? ˹And so˺ God left them to stray knowingly, sealed their hearing and hearts, and placed a cover on their sight. Who then can guide them after God? Will you ˹all˺ not then be mindful"
  45,24,"And they argue, “There is nothing beyond our worldly life. We die; others are born. And nothing destroys us but ˹the passage of˺ time.” Yet they have no knowledge ˹in support˺ of this ˹claim˺. They only speculate"
  45,25,"And whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, their only argument is to say: “Bring our forefathers back, if what you say is true!”"
  45,26,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹It is˺ God ˹Who˺ gives you life, then causes you to die, then will gather you ˹all˺ on the Day of Judgment, about which there is no doubt. But most people do not know.”"
  45,27,"To God ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. On the Day the Hour will be established, the people of falsehood will then be in ˹total˺ loss"
  45,28,"And you will see every faith-community on its knees. Every community will be summoned to its record ˹of deeds˺. ˹They all will be told,˺ “This Day you will be rewarded for what you used to do"
  45,29,"This record of Ours speaks the truth about you. Indeed, We always had your deeds recorded ˹by the angels˺.”"
  45,30,"As for those who believed and did good, their Lord will admit them into His mercy. That is ˹truly˺ the absolute triumph"
  45,31,"And as for those who disbelieved, ˹they will be told,˺ “Were My revelations not recited to you, yet you acted arrogantly and were a wicked people"
  45,32,"And whenever it was said ˹to you˺, ‘Surely God’s promise ˹of judgment˺ is true and there is no doubt about the Hour,’ you said ˹mockingly˺, ‘We do not know what the Hour is! We think it is no more than speculation, and we are not convinced ˹that it will ever come˺.’”"
