quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  60,12,"O Prophet! When the believing women come to you, pledging to you that they will neither associate anything with God ˹in worship˺, nor steal, nor fornicate, nor kill their children, nor falsely attribute ˹illegitimate˺ children to their husbands, nor disobey you in what is right, then accept their pledge, and ask God to forgive them. Surely God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  60,13,"O believers! Do not ally yourselves with a people God is displeased with. They already have no hope for the Hereafter, just like the disbelievers lying in ˹their˺ graves"
  61,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth glorifies God. For He ˹alone˺ is the Almighty, All-Wise"
  61,2,O believers! Why do you say what you do not do
  61,3,How despicable it is in the sight of God that you say what you do not do
  61,4,Surely God loves those who fight in His cause in ˹solid˺ ranks as if they were one concrete structure
  61,5,"˹Remember, O Prophet,˺ when Moses said to his people, “O my people! Why do you hurt me when you already know I am God’s messenger to you?” So when they ˹persistently˺ deviated, God caused their hearts to deviate. For God does not guide the rebellious people"
