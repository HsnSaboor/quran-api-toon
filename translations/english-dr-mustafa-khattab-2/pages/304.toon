quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  18,98,"He declared, “This is a mercy from my Lord. But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will level it to the ground. And my Lord’s promise is ever true.”"
  18,99,"On that Day, We will let them surge ˹like waves˺ over one another. Later, the Trumpet will be blown, and We will gather all ˹people˺ together"
  18,100,On that Day We will display Hell clearly for the disbelievers
  18,101,those who turned a blind eye to My Reminder and could not stand listening ˹to it˺
  18,102,Do the disbelievers think they can ˹simply˺ take My servants as lords instead of Me? We have surely prepared Hell as an accommodation for the disbelievers
  18,103,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Shall we inform you of who will lose the most deeds"
  18,104,"˹They are˺ those whose efforts are in vain in this worldly life, while they think they are doing good!”"
  18,105,"It is they who reject the signs of their Lord and their meeting with Him, rendering their deeds void, so We will not give their deeds any weight on Judgment Day"
  18,106,"That is their reward: Hell, for their disbelief and mockery of My signs and messengers"
  18,107,"Indeed, those who believe and do good will have the Gardens of Paradise as an accommodation"
  18,108,"where they will be forever, never desiring anywhere else"
  18,109,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If the ocean were ink for ˹writing˺ the Words of my Lord, it would certainly run out before the Words of my Lord were finished, even if We refilled it with its equal.”"
  18,110,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I am only a man like you, ˹but˺ it has been revealed to me that your God is only One God. So whoever hopes for the meeting with their Lord, let them do good deeds and associate none in the worship of their Lord.”"
