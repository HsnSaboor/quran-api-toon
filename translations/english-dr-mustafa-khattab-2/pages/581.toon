quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Did We not create you from a humble fluid
  77,21,placing it in a secure place
  77,22,until an appointed time
  77,23,We ˹perfectly˺ ordained ˹its development˺. How excellent are We in doing so
  77,24,Woe on that Day to the deniers
  77,25,Have We not made the earth a lodging
  77,26,for the living and the dead
  77,27,"and placed upon it towering, firm mountains, and given you fresh water to drink"
  77,28,Woe on that Day to the deniers
  77,29,"˹The disbelievers will be told,˺ “Proceed into that ˹Fire˺ which you used to deny"
  77,30,Proceed into the shade ˹of smoke˺ which rises in three columns
  77,31,providing neither coolness nor shelter from the flames
  77,32,"Indeed, it hurls sparks ˹as big˺ as huge castles"
  77,33,and ˹as dark˺ as black camels.”
  77,34,Woe on that Day to the deniers
  77,35,On that Day they will not ˹be in a position to˺ speak
  77,36,nor will they be permitted to offer excuses
  77,37,Woe on that Day to the deniers
  77,38,"˹They will be told by God,˺ “This is the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision: We have gathered you along with earlier disbelievers ˹for punishment˺"
  77,39,"So if you have a scheme ˹to save yourselves˺, then use it against Me.”"
  77,40,Woe on that Day to the deniers
  77,41,"Indeed, the righteous will be amid ˹cool˺ shade and springs"
  77,42,and any fruit they desire
  77,43,"˹They will be told,˺ “Eat and drink happily for what you used to do.”"
  77,44,Surely this is how We reward the good-doers
  77,45,˹But˺ woe on that Day to the deniers
  77,46,"“Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little while, ˹for˺ you are truly wicked.”"
  77,47,Woe on that Day to the deniers
  77,48,"When it is said to them, “Bow down ˹before God,” they do not bow"
  77,49,Woe on that Day to the deniers
  77,50,So what message after this ˹Quran˺ would they believe in
