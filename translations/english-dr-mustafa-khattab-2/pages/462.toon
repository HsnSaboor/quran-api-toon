quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  39,32,Who then does more wrong than those who lie about God and reject the truth after it has reached them? Is Hell not a ˹fitting˺ home for the disbelievers
  39,33,And the one who has brought the truth and those who embrace it—it is they who are the righteous
  39,34,They will have whatever they desire with their Lord. That is the reward of the good-doers
  39,35,"As such, God will absolve them of ˹even˺ the worst of what they did and reward them according to the best of what they used to do"
  39,36,Is God not sufficient for His servant? Yet they threaten you with other ˹powerless˺ gods besides Him! Whoever God leaves to stray will be left with no guide
  39,37,"And whoever God guides, none can lead astray. Is God not Almighty, capable of punishment"
  39,38,"If you ask them ˹O Prophet˺ who created the heavens and the earth, they will certainly say, “God!” Ask ˹them˺, “Consider then whatever ˹idols˺ you invoke besides God: if it was God’s Will to harm me, could they undo that harm? Or if He willed ˹some˺ mercy for me, could they withhold His mercy?” Say, “God is sufficient for me. In Him ˹alone˺ the faithful put their trust.”"
  39,39,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O my people! Persist in your ways, for I ˹too˺ will persist in mine. You will soon come to know"
  39,40,who will be visited by a humiliating torment ˹in this life˺ and overwhelmed by an everlasting punishment ˹in the next˺.”
