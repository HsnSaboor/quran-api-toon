quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  20,38,when We inspired your mother with this
  20,39,"‘Put him into a chest, then put it into the river. The river will wash it ashore, and he will be taken by ˹Pharaoh,˺ an enemy of Mine and his.’ And I blessed you with lovability from Me ˹O Moses˺ so that you would be brought up under My ˹watchful˺ Eye"
  20,40,"˹Remember˺ when your sister came along and proposed, ‘Shall I direct you to someone who will nurse him?’ So We reunited you with your mother so that her heart would be put at ease, and she would not grieve. ˹Later˺ you killed a man ˹by mistake˺, but We saved you from sorrow, as well as other tests We put you through. Then you stayed for a number of years among the people of Midian. Then you came here as pre-destined, O Moses"
  20,41,And I have selected you for My service
  20,42,"Go forth, you and your brother, with My signs and never falter in remembering Me"
  20,43,"Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, for he has truly transgressed ˹all bounds˺"
  20,44,"Speak to him gently, so perhaps he may be mindful ˹of Me˺ or fearful ˹of My punishment˺.”"
  20,45,"They both pleaded, “Our Lord! We fear that he may be quick to harm us or act tyrannically.”"
  20,46,"God reassured ˹them˺, “Have no fear! I am with you, hearing and seeing"
  20,47,"So go to him and say, ‘Indeed we are both messengers from your Lord, so let the Children of Israel go with us, and do not oppress them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord. And salvation will be for whoever follows the ˹right˺ guidance"
  20,48,It has indeed been revealed to us that the punishment will be upon whoever denies ˹the truth˺ and turns away.’”
  20,49,"Pharaoh asked, “Who then is the Lord of you two, O Moses?”"
  20,50,"He answered, “Our Lord is the One Who has given everything its ˹distinctive˺ form, then guided ˹it˺.”"
  20,51,"Pharaoh asked, “And what about previous peoples?”"
