quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,"But no! In fact, you love this fleeting world"
  75,21,and neglect the Hereafter
  75,22,On that Day ˹some˺ faces will be bright
  75,23,looking at their Lord
  75,24,And ˹other˺ faces will be gloomy
  75,25,anticipating something devastating to befall them
  75,26,But no! ˹Beware of the day˺ when the soul reaches the collar bone ˹as it leaves˺

  75,35,"Again, woe to you, and even more woe"

  75,39,"producing from it both sexes, male and female"

  76,2,"˹For˺ indeed, We ˹alone˺ created humans from a drop of mixed fluids, ˹in order˺ to test them, so We made them hear and see"
  76,3,"We already showed them the Way, whether they ˹choose to˺ be grateful or ungrateful"
  76,4,"Indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers chains, shackles, and a blazing Fire"
  76,5,"Indeed, the virtuous will have a drink ˹of pure wine˺—flavoured with camphor—"
