quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,But you ˹deniers only˺ prefer the life of this world
  87,17,even though the Hereafter is far better and more lasting
  87,18,This is certainly ˹mentioned˺ in the earlier Scriptures—
  87,19,the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Has the news of the Overwhelming Event reached you ˹O Prophet˺
  88,2,On that Day ˹some˺ faces will be downcast
  88,3,"˹totally˺ overburdened, exhausted"
  88,4,burning in a scorching Fire
  88,5,left to drink from a scalding spring
  88,6,"They will have no food except a foul, thorny shrub"
  88,7,neither nourishing nor satisfying hunger
  88,8,On that Day ˹other˺ faces will be glowing with bliss
  88,9,˹fully˺ pleased with their striving
  88,10,in an elevated Garden
  88,11,where no idle talk will be heard
  88,12,In it will be a running spring
  88,13,along with thrones raised high
  88,14,and cups set at hand
  88,15,and ˹fine˺ cushions lined up
  88,16,and ˹splendid˺ carpets spread out
  88,17,Do they not ever reflect on camels—how they were ˹masterfully˺ created
  88,18,and the sky—how it was raised ˹high˺
  88,19,and the mountains—how they were firmly set up
  88,20,and the earth—how it was levelled out
  88,21,"So, ˹continue to˺ remind ˹all, O Prophet˺, for your duty is only to remind"
  88,22,You are not ˹there˺ to compel them ˹to believe˺
  88,23,"But whoever turns away, persisting in disbelief"
  88,24,then God will inflict upon them the major punishment
  88,25,Surely to Us is their return
  88,26,then surely with Us is their reckoning
