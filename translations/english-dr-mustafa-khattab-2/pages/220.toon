quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,98,"If only there had been a society which believed ˹before seeing the torment˺ and, therefore, benefited from its belief, like the people of Jonah. When they believed, We lifted from them the torment of disgrace in this world and allowed them enjoyment for a while"
  10,99,"Had your Lord so willed ˹O Prophet˺, all ˹people˺ on earth would have certainly believed, every single one of them! Would you then force people to become believers"
  10,100,"It is not for any soul to believe except by God’s leave, and He will bring His wrath upon those who are unmindful"
  10,101,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Consider all that is in the heavens and the earth!” Yet neither signs nor warners are of any benefit to those who refuse to believe"
  10,102,"Are they waiting for ˹anything˺ except the same torments that befell those before them? Say, “Keep waiting then! I too am waiting with you.”"
  10,103,Then We saved Our messengers and those who believed. For it is Our duty to save the believers
  10,104,"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! If you are in doubt of my faith, then ˹know that˺ I do not worship those ˹idols˺ you worship instead of God. But I worship God, Who has the power to cause your death. And I have been commanded, ‘Be one of the believers,’"
  10,105,"and, ‘Be steadfast in faith in all uprightness, and do not be one of the polytheists,’"
  10,106,"and ‘Do not invoke, instead of God, what can neither benefit nor harm you—for if you do, then you will certainly be one of the wrongdoers,’"
