quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"˹Later,˺ Abraham asked, “What is your mission, O messengers?”"
  51,32,"They replied, “We have actually been sent to a wicked people"
  51,33,to send upon them stones of ˹baked˺ clay
  51,34,marked by your Lord for the transgressors.”
  51,35,Then ˹before the torment˺ We evacuated the believers from the city
  51,36,But We only found one family that had submitted ˹to God˺
  51,37,And We have left a sign there ˹as a lesson˺ for those who fear the painful punishment
  51,38,"And in ˹the story of˺ Moses ˹was another lesson,˺ when We sent him to Pharaoh with compelling proof"
  51,39,"but Pharaoh was carried away by his power, saying ˹of Moses˺, “A magician or a madman!”"
  51,40,"So We seized him and his soldiers, casting them into the sea while he was blameworthy"
  51,41,"And in ˹the story of˺ ’Âd ˹was another lesson,˺ when We sent against them the devastating wind"
  51,42,There was nothing it came upon that it did not reduce to ashes
  51,43,"And in ˹the story of˺ Thamûd ˹was another lesson,˺ when they were told, “Enjoy yourselves ˹only˺ for a ˹short˺ while.”"
  51,44,"Still they persisted in defying the commands of their Lord, so they were overtaken by a ˹mighty˺ blast while they were looking on"
  51,45,"Then they were not able to rise up, nor were they helped"
  51,46,And the people of Noah ˹had also been destroyed˺ earlier. They were truly a rebellious people
  51,47,"We built the universe with ˹great˺ might, and We are certainly expanding ˹it˺"
  51,48,"As for the earth, We spread it out. How superbly did We smooth it out"
  51,49,And We created pairs of all things so perhaps you would be mindful
  51,50,"So ˹proclaim, O Prophet˺: “Flee to God! I am truly sent by Him with a clear warning to you"
  51,51,And do not set up another god with God. I am truly sent by Him with a clear warning to you.”
