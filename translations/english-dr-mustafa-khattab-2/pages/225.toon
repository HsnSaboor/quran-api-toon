quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,"O my people! I do not ask you for a payment for this ˹message˺. My reward is only from God. And I will never dismiss the believers, for they will surely meet their Lord. But I can see that you are a people acting ignorantly"
  11,30,O my people! Who would protect me from God if I were to dismiss them? Will you not then be mindful
  11,31,"I do not say to you that I possess God’s treasuries or know the unseen, nor do I claim to be an angel, nor do I say that God will never grant goodness to those you look down upon. God knows best what is ˹hidden˺ within them. ˹If I did,˺ then I would truly be one of the wrongdoers.”"
  11,32,"They protested, “O Noah! You have argued with us far too much, so bring upon us what you threaten us with, if what you say is true.”"
  11,33,"He responded, “It is God Who can bring it upon you if He wills, and then you will have no escape"
  11,34,"My advice will not benefit you—no matter how hard I try—if God wills ˹for˺ you to stray. He is your Lord, and to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned.”"
  11,35,"Or do they say, “He has fabricated this ˹Quran˺!”? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If I have done so, then I bear the burden of that sin! But I am free from your sinful accusation.”"
  11,36,"And it was revealed to Noah, “None of your people will believe except those who already have. So do not be distressed by what they have been doing"
  11,37,"And build the Ark under Our ˹watchful˺ Eyes and directions, and do not plead with Me for those who have done wrong, for they will surely be drowned.”"
