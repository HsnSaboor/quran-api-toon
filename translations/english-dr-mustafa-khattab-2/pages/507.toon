quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"Those who disbelieve and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of God, He will render their deeds void"
  47,2,"As for those who believe, do good, and have faith in what has been revealed to Muḥammad—which is the truth from their Lord—He will absolve them of their sins and improve their condition"
  47,3,"This is because the disbelievers follow falsehood, while the believers follow the truth from their Lord. This is how God shows people their true state ˹of faith˺"
  47,4,"So when you meet the disbelievers ˹in battle˺, strike ˹their˺ necks until you have thoroughly subdued them, then bind them firmly. Later ˹free them either as˺ an act of grace or by ransom until the war comes to an end. So will it be. Had God willed, He ˹Himself˺ could have inflicted punishment on them. But He does ˹this only to˺ test some of you by means of others. And those who are martyred in the cause of God, He will never render their deeds void"
  47,5,"He will guide them ˹to their reward˺, improve their condition"
  47,6,"and admit them into Paradise, having made it known to them"
  47,7,"O believers! If you stand up for God, He will help you and make your steps firm"
  47,8,"As for the disbelievers, may they be doomed and may He render their deeds void"
  47,9,"That is because they detest what God has revealed, so He has rendered their deeds void"
  47,10,"Have they not travelled throughout the land to see what was the end of those before them? God annihilated them, and a similar fate awaits the disbelievers"
  47,11,This is because God is the Patron of the believers while the disbelievers have no patron
