quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,"BY THE Fig, and by the Olive"
  95,2,By Mount Sinai
  95,3,and by this inviolate city.²
  95,4,We created man in a most noble image
  95,5,and then We shall reduce him to the lowest of the low
  95,6,"except those who believe and do good works, for theirs shall be a boundless recompense"
  95,7,What then after this can make you deny the Last Judgement
  95,8,Is God not the most just of judges
  96,1,READ IN the name of your Lord who created ―
  96,2,created Man from clots of blood
  96,3,Read! Your Lord is the Most Bountiful One
  96,4,who by the pen taught
  96,5,Man what he did not know
  96,6,No! Man transgresses
  96,7,"in thinking himself his own master:²"
  96,8,for to your Lord shall all return
  96,9,Consider the man who rebukes
  96,10,Our servant when he prays
  96,11,"Consider: does he follow the right guidance"
  96,12,or enjoin true piety
  96,13,"Do but consider: if he denies the Truth and pays no heed"
  96,14,does he not realize that God sees all
  96,15,"No! Let him desist, or We will drag him by the forelock"
  96,16,"his lying, sinful forelock"
  96,17,Then let him call his helpmates
  96,18,We will call the guards of Hell
  96,19,"No, never obey him! Prostrate yourself and come nearer"
