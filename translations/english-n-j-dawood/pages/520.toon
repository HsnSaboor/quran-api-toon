quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,"How many generations, far greater in prowess, have We wiped out before them! They searched the entire land: but could they find a refuge"
  50,37,"Surely in this there is a lesson for everyone who is of a heart possessed, and can hear and see"
  50,38,In six days We created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them; nor were We ever wearied
  50,39,Bear then with what they² say. Give glory to your Lord before sunrise and before sunset
  50,40,"In the night praise Him, and make the additional prostrations"
  50,41,Listen on the day when the Crier will call from near
  50,42,the day when they will hear the cry of Truth. On that day they will rise up from their graves
  50,43,It is We who ordain life and death; and to Us shall all return
  50,44,"On that day the earth will be rent asunder over them, and from it they shall emerge in haste. To herd them all is easy enough for Us"
  50,45,We well know what they say. You shall not use coercion with them. Admonish with the Koran whoever fears My threat
  51,1,BY THE dust-scattering winds
  51,2,and the heavily-laden clouds
  51,3,by the smoothly-gliding ships
  51,4,and by the angels who deal out as commanded
  51,5,that which you are promised shall truly be fulfilled
  51,6,and the Last Judgement shall surely come to pass
