quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,FOR THE protection of Quraysh
  106,2,their protection in their winter and summer journeyings
  106,3,Therefore let them worship the Lord of this House
  106,4,who fed them when there was famine and shielded them from fear
  107,1,HAVE YOU considered him that denies the Last Judgement
  107,2,It is he who turns away the orphan
  107,3,and does not urge the feeding of the destitute
  107,4,Woe betide those who pray
  107,5,but are heedless of their prayer
  107,6,who make a show of piety
  107,7,and forbid alms-giving
  108,1,WE HAVE given you² abundance
  108,2,So pray to your Lord and sacrifice to Him
  108,3,He that hates you shall remain childless
