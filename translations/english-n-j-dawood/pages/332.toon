quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  22,1,YOU PEOPLE! Have fear of your Lord. The catastrophe of the Hour shall be terrible indeed
  22,2,"The day you witness it, every suckling mother shall forsake her infant, every pregnant female shall cast her burden, and you shall see people reeling like drunkards although not drunk: but such shall be the horror of God‘s torment"
  22,3,"Yet there are some who in their ignorance dispute about God, and follow every rebellious demon"
  22,4,doomed to seduce his follower and lead him to the scourge of the Conflagration
  22,5,"You people! If you doubt the Resurrection remember that We had created you from dust, then from a living germ, then from a clot of blood,² and then from a half-formed lump of flesh, so that We might manifest to you Our power. We cause to remain in the womb whatever We please for an appointed term, and then We bring you forth as infants, that you may grow up and reach your prime. Some among you die young, and some live on to abject old age when all that they once knew they know no more. You sometimes see the earth dry and barren: but no sooner do We send the water down upon it than it begins to stir and swell, putting forth every kind of radiant bloom"
