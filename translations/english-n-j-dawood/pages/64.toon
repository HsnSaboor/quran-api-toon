  3,109,His is all that the heavens and the earth contain. To God shall all things return
  3,110,"You are the noblest community ever raised up for people. You enjoin justice and forbid the reprehensible and believe in God. Had the People of the Book accepted the Faith, it would surely have been better for them. Some are true believers, but most of them are ungodly"
  3,111,"If they harm you, they can cause you but little hurt; and if they fight you they will turn their backs and run away. Then there shall be none to help them"
  3,112,"Servility shall be stamped upon them wherever they are found, unless they make a covenant with God and a covenant with man.

  3,113,Yet they are not all alike. There are among the People of the Book an upright community who all night long recite God‘s revelations and bow down in worship
  3,114,"who believe in God and the Last Day; who enjoin justice and forbid the reprehensible, and strive to do good works. These are among the righteous"
  3,115,"whatever good they do, its reward shall not be denied them. God well knows those that fear Him"
