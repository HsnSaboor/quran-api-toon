  21,95,It is ordained that no community We have destroyed shall ever rise again
  21,96,But when Gog and Magog are let loose and rush headlong down every hill
  21,97,"when the true promise nears its fulfilment; the unbeliever‘s eyes shall stare in amazement: ‘Woe betide us! Of this we have been heedless. We have assuredly done wrong.‘"
  21,98,You and your idols shall be the fuel of Hell; therein shall you all go down
  21,99,"Were they true gods, they would not go there: but therein shall they abide for ever"
  21,100,They shall groan with anguish and be bereft of hearing
  21,101,But those to whom We have long since shown Our bounty shall be far removed from Hell
