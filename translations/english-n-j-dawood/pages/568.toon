quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,Today he shall be friendless here
  69,36,only filth shall be his food
  69,37,the filth which only sinners eat.‘
  69,38,I swear by all that you can see
  69,39,and all that is hidden from your view
  69,40,that this is the utterance of a noble messenger
  69,41,"It is no poet‘s speech: scant is your faith"
  69,42,"It is no soothsayer‘s divination: how little you reflect"
  69,43,It is a revelation from the Lord of the Universe
  69,44,Had he invented lies concerning Us
  69,45,We would have seized him by the right hand
  69,46,and severed his heart‘s vein
  69,47,not one of you could have protected him
  69,48,It¹ is but an Admonition to the righteous
  69,49,We well know that there are some among you who will deny it
  69,50,It is the despair of the unbelievers
  69,51,It is the indubitable Truth
  69,52,"Praise, then, the name of your Lord, the Almighty"
  70,1,A SCEPTIC² once demanded that punishment be visited
  70,2,forthwith upon the unbelievers. No power can hinder
  70,3,God from punishing them. He is the Lord of the Stairways
  70,4,whereby the angels and the Spirit will ascend to Him in one day whose space is fifty thousand years
  70,5,Therefore conduct yourself with becoming patience
  70,6,They think the Day of Judgement is far off
  70,7,but We see it near at hand
  70,8,On that day the sky shall become like molten brass
  70,9,and the mountains like tufts of wool scattered in the wind
  70,10,No bosom friend shall ask a bosom friend when eye meets eye
