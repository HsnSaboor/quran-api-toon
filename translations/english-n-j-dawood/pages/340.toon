quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,65,"Do you not see that God has subdued for you all that is in the earth? And the ships which sail the sea at His bidding? He holds the sky from falling down upon the earth: this it shall not do except by His own leave. Kindly is God, and compassionate to mankind"
  22,66,"It is He who has given you life, and He who will cause you to die and make you live again. Surely man is ungrateful"
  22,67,"For every community We have ordained a ritual which they observe. Let them not dispute with you concerning this. Call them to the path of your Lord: you are rightly guided"
  22,68,"If they argue with you, say: ‘God knows best all that you do"
  22,69,On the Day of Resurrection God will judge your differences.‘
  22,70,Are you not aware that God has knowledge of what heaven and earth contain? All is recorded in a Book. That is easy enough for God
  22,71,Yet they worship besides God that for which no sanction is revealed and of which they know nothing. The wrong-doers shall have none to help them
  22,72,"And when Our revelations are recited to them in all their clarity, you will note denial in the faces of the unbelievers. Barely can they restrain themselves from assaulting those who recite Our revelations. Say: ‘Shall I tell you what is worse than that? The Fire which God has promised those who deny Him. A wretched fate.‘"
