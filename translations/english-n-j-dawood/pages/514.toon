quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  48,24,And He it was who ended hostilities between you in the Valley of Mecca³ after He had given you victory over them. God was watching all your actions
  48,25,"It was they who disbelieved and debarred you from the Sacred Mosque and prevented your offerings from reaching their destination. But for the fear that you might have trampled underfoot believing men and women unknown to you and thus incurred unwitting guilt on their account, He ordained it thus that He might admit whom He will into His mercy. Had they stood apart from them, We would have inflicted a woeful punishment on those of them who were unbelievers"
  48,26,"And while bigotry ― the bigotry of ignorance ― was holding its sway in the hearts of the unbelievers, God sent down His Divine Presence¹ on His apostle and on the faithful and made the word of piety binding on them, for they were most worthy and deserving of it. God has knowledge of all things"
  48,27,"God has in all truth fulfilled His apostle‘s vision: ‘If God wills, you shall enter the Sacred Mosque secure and fearless, with hair cropped or shaven.‘ He knew what you knew not; and what is more, He granted you a speedy victory"
  48,28,"He it is that has sent forth His apostle with guidance and the Religion of Truth, that he may exalt it above all religions. Sufficient is God as a witness"
