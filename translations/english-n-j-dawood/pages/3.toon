  2,11,"If they are told: ‘You shall not do evil in the land,‘ they reply: ‘Surely we are doing only what is good.‘"
  2,12,"But it is they who are the evil-doers, though they may not perceive it"
  2,13,"And if they are told: ‘Believe as the people believe,‘ they reply: ‘Are we to believe as fools believe?‘ It is they who are the fools, if they but knew it"
  2,14,"And when they meet the faithful, they declare: ‘We, too, are believers.‘ But when alone with their demons they say to them: ‘We follow none but you: we were only mocking.‘"
  2,15,"God will mock them and keep them long in sin, ever straying from the right path"
  2,16,"Such are those that barter guidance for error: they profit nothing, nor are they on the right path"
