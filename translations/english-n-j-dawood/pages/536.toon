quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  56,51,Then as for you who err and disbelieve
  56,52,you shall eat from the Zaqqūm tree
  56,53,and fill your bellies with it‘s fruit
  56,54,You shall drink scalding water
  56,55,yet you shall drink it as the thirsty camel drinks.‘
  56,56,Such shall be their fare on the Day of Reckoning
  56,57,"We created you: why then will you not believe"
  56,58,Behold the semen you discharge
  56,59,"did you create it, or were We it‘s Creators"
  56,60,It was We that ordained death among you. Nothing can hinder Us
  56,61,from replacing you by others like yourselves or transforming you into beings you know nothing of
  56,62,"You surely know of the First Creation. Why, then, do you not reflect"
  56,63,Consider the earth you till
  56,64,"Is it you that sow the seeds, or are We the Sower"
  56,65,"If We pleased, We could turn your harvest into chaff, so that you would keep forlornly jesting"
  56,66,We are laden with debts
  56,67,"Why, we have been robbed!‘"
  56,68,Consider the water which you drink
  56,69,"Was it you that sent it down from the cloud, or were We the Senders"
  56,70,"If We pleased, We could turn it bitter. Why, then, do you not give thanks"
  56,71,Consider the fire which you light
  56,72,"Was it you that made the timber, or were We the Makers"
  56,73,"A reminder for man We made it, and for the traveller a comfort"
  56,74,"Praise, then, the name of your Lord, the Supreme One"
  56,75,I swear by the shelter of the stars
  56,76,"a mighty oath, if you but knew it"
