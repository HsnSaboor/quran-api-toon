  38,17,"Bear with what they say, and remember Our servant David, who was both a mighty and a penitent man"
  38,18,We made the mountains¹ join with him in praise evening and morning
  38,19,"and the birds, too, in all their flocks; all were obedient to him"

  38,21,Have you heard the story of the litigants who entered his chamber by climbing over the wall
  38,22,"When they went in to David and saw that he was alarmed, they said: ‘Fear not. We are two litigants, one of whom has wronged the other. Judge rightly between us and do not be unjust; guide us to the right path"
  38,23,"My brother here has ninety-nine ewes, but I have only one ewe². He demanded that I should entrust it to him, and got the better of me in the dispute.‘"
  38,24,"He said: ‘He has certainly wronged you in seeking to add your ewe to his flock. Many partners are unjust to one another; but not so those that have faith and do good works, and they are few indeed.‘ David realized that We were only testing him. He sought forgiveness of his Lord and fell down penitently on his knees"
  38,25,We forgave him that; and in Our presence he shall be honoured and well received
  38,26,"David, We have made you master in the land. Rule with justice among people and do not yield to lust, lest it turn you away from God‘s path.‘ Because they forget the Day of Reckoning, those that stray from God‘s path shall be grievously punished.‘"
