quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,138,"They say: ‘These animals and these crops are forbidden. None may eat of them save those whom we permit.‘ So they assert. And there are beasts which they prohibit men from riding, and others over which they do not pronounce the name of God, thus inventing lies against Him. He will punish them for the lies they invented"
  6,139,"They also say: ‘The offspring of these animals is lawful for our males but forbidden to our females.‘ But if it is stillborn, they all partake of it! He will punish them for their imputations. Surely He is wise and all-knowing"
  6,140,"Losers are those that in their ignorance have wantonly slain their own children and made unlawful what God has given them, inventing falsehoods about God. They have surely gone astray and are not guided"
  6,141,"And He it is who brings gardens into being: creepers and upright trees, the palm, and produce of various taste, and olives, and pomegranates alike and different. Eat of these fruits when they ripen and give away what is due of them upon the harvest day. But you shall not be prodigal; He does not love the prodigal"
  6,142,"Of the beasts you have, some are for carrying loads and others for slaughter. Eat of that which God has given you and do not walk in Satan‘s footsteps; he is your inveterate foe"
