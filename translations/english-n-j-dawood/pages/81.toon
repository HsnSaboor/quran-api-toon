  4,21,for how can you take it back when you have lain with each other and entered into a firm contract
  4,22,"You shall not marry the women whom your fathers married: all previous such marriages excepted. That was an evil practice, indecent and abominable"
  4,23,"Forbidden to you are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal and maternal aunts, the daughters of your brothers and sisters, your foster-mothers, your foster sisters, the mothers of your wives, your step-daughters who are in your charge, born of the wives with whom you have lain (it is no offence for you to marry your step-daughters if you have not consummated your marriage with their mothers), and the wives of your own begotten sons.¹ You are forbidden also to marry two sisters at one and the same time: all previous such marriages excepted. Surely God is forgiving and compassionate"
