quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,7,"Men shall have a share in what their parents and kin leave; and women shall have a share in what their parents and kin leave: whether it be little or much, they shall be entitled to a share decreed"
  4,8,"If relatives, orphans, or needy men are present at the division of an inheritance, give them, too, a share of it, and speak kind words to them"
  4,9,Let those who are solicitous about the welfare of their young children after their own death take care not to wrong orphans. Let them fear God and speak for justice
  4,10,"Those that devour the property of orphans unjustly, do swallow fire into their bellies; they shall burn in a mighty conflagration"
  4,11,"God has thus enjoined you concerning your children: A male shall inherit twice as much as a female. If there be more than two girls, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance; but if there be one only, she shall inherit the half. Parents shall inherit a sixth each, if the deceased have a child; but if he leave no child and his parents be his heirs, his mother shall have a third. If he have brothers, his mother shall have a sixth after payment of any legacy he may have bequeathed or any debt he may have owed. You may wonder whether your parents or your children are more beneficial to you. But this is a decree from God; surely God is all-knowing and wise"
