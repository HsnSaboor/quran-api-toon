quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  31,12,"We bestowed wisdom on Luqmān,¹ saying: ‘Give thanks to God. He that gives thanks has much to gain for his own soul, but if anyone is thankless, God is self-sufficient and worthy of praise.‘"
  31,13,"Tell of Luqman, who admonished his son, saying: ‘My son, serve no other deity besides God, for idolatry is an abominable sin.‘"
  31,14,"We enjoined man to show kindness to his parents, for with much pain his mother bears him, and he is not weaned before he is two years of age. We said: ‘Give thanks to Me and to your parents. To Me shall all return"
  31,15,"But if they press you to serve besides Me deities you know nothing of, do not obey them. Be kind to them in this world, and follow the path of those who turn to Me. To Me shall you return, and I will declare to you what you have done.‘"
  31,16,"My son, if it be as small as a grain of mustard seed, be it hidden inside a rock or in the heavens or in the earth, God will bring it to light. Surely gracious is God and all-knowing"
  31,17,"My son, be steadfast in prayer, enjoin justice, and forbid the reprehensible. Endure with fortitude whatever befalls you. That is a duty incumbent on all"
  31,18,"Do not treat people with scorn, nor walk exultant on the earth: surely God does not love the arrogant and the vainglorious"
  31,19,"Rather let your stride be modest and your voice low: the most hideous of voices is the braying of the ass.‘"
