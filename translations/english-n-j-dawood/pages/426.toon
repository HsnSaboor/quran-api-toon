quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,55,"It shall be no offence for the Prophet‘s wives to be seen unveiled by their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers‘ sons, their sisters‘ sons, their women, or their slave-girls. Women, have fear of God; surely God observes all things"
  33,56,"The Prophet is blessed by God and His angels. Bless him, then, you that are true believers, and greet him with a worthy salutation"
  33,57,Those who speak ill of God and His apostle shall be cursed by God in this life and in the life to come. He has prepared for them a shameful punishment
  33,58,Those who traduce believing men and believing women undeservedly shall bear the guilt of slander and grievous sin
  33,59,"Prophet, enjoin your wives, your daughters, and the wives of true believers to draw their veils close round them. That is more proper, so that they may be recognized and not be molested. God is ever forgiving and compassionate"
  33,60,"If the hypocrites and those who have tainted hearts and the scandal mongers of Madinah do not desist, We will rouse you against them; and their days therein will be numbered"
  33,61,"Cursed wherever they are found, they will be seized and put to death without mercy"
  33,62,Such has been God‘s way with those who have gone before them. And you shall find no change in the way of God
