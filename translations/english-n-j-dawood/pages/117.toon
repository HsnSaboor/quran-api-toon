quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,51,"Believers, take neither the Jews nor the Christians for your friends. They are friends to each other. Whoever of you seeks their friendship shall become one of their number. God does not guide the wrongdoing people"
  5,52,"You see the faint-hearted hastening to woo them. They say: ‘We fear lest a change of fortune should befall us.‘ But it may well be that when God grants victory or makes known His will, they will regret their secret plans"
  5,53,"Then will the faithful say: ‘Are these the men who solemnly swore by God that they would stand by you?‘ Their works will come to nothing and they will lose all"
  5,54,"Believers, if any among you renounce their religion, God will replace them by others who love Him and are loved by Him, who are humble towards the faithful and stern towards the unbelievers, zealous for God‘s cause and fearless of man‘s censure. Such is the grace of God: He bestows it on whom He will. God is munificent and all-knowing"
  5,55,"Your only protectors are God, His apostle, and the faithful: those who attend to their prayers, render the alms levy, and kneel down in worship"
  5,56,"Those who seek the protection of God, His apostle, and the faithful must know that God‘s party is sure to triumph"
  5,57,"Believers, do not seek the friendship of those who have mocked and derided your religion, among those who were given the Book before you; nor of the infidels. And fear God, if you are true believers"
