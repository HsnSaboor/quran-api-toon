  97,1,WE REVEALED it on the Night of Qadr.³
  97,2,Would that you knew what the Night of Qadr is like
  97,3,Better is the Night of Qadr than a thousand months
  97,4,On that night the angels and the Spirit by their Lord‘s leave come down with each command
  97,5,"Peace it is, till break of dawn"
  98,1,THE UNBELIEVERS among the People of the Book¹ and the pagans did not desist from unbelief until the Proof was given them
  98,2,an apostle from God reciting from purified pages
  98,3,infallible decrees
  98,4,Nor did those who were vouchsafed the Book divide themselves until the Proof was given them
  98,5,"Yet they were enjoined only to worship God and to consecrate their religion to Him, to attend to their prayers and to render the alms levy. That, surely, is the infallible faith"
  98,6,The unbelievers among the People of the Book and the pagans shall in the fire of Hell abide for ever. They are the vilest of all creatures
  98,7,But of all creatures those that believe and do good works are the noblest
