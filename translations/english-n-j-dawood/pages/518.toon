quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  50,1,Qāf. BY the Glorious Koran
  50,2,"They indeed marvel that one of their own has come to warn them; so that the unbelievers say: ‘This is indeed a wondrous thing"
  50,3,When we are dead and turned to dust . . . ?¹ Such a return is most improbable!‘
  50,4,We know how the earth consumes them. We hold a book which records all
  50,5,"Indeed, they denied the Truth when it had come to them, and now they are perplexed"
  50,6,"Have they never observed the sky above them, how We built it up and furnished it with ornaments, leaving no crack in its expanse"
  50,7,And We spread out the earth and set upon it immovable mountains. We brought forth from it all kinds of delectable plants
  50,8,A lesson and an Admonition to every penitent mortal
  50,9,We send down blessed water from the sky with which We bring forth gardens and the harvest grain
  50,10,and tall palm-trees laden with clusters of dates
  50,11,a sustenance for humankind; thereby giving new life to a dead land. Such shall be the Resurrection
  50,12,Long before these the people of Noah and the dwellers of Al-Rass¹ denied the Truth; and so did Thamūd
  50,13,"and ‘Ād, Pharaoh and the kin of Lot"
  50,14,the dwellers of the Forest² and the people of Tubba‘;³ all disbelieved the apostles and were thus visited by My threatened scourge
  50,15,Were We worn out by the First Creation? Yet they are in doubt about a new creation.⁴
