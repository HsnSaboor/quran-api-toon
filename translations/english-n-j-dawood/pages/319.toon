quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  20,99,Thus do We recount to you the history of events gone by. An Admonition of Our own have We given you
  20,100,those that reject it shall bear a heavy burden on the Day of Resurrection
  20,101,"Forever shall they bear it: an evil burden on the Day of Resurrection"
  20,102,On the day when the Trumpet shall be blown; on that day We shall herd all the sinners together. Their eyes blue with terror
  20,103,"they shall murmur among themselves: ‘You lingered on the earth but ten days.‘"
  20,104,"We know full well what they will say. The most upright among them will say: ‘You lingered but one day.‘"
  20,105,"And they ask you about the mountains. Say: ‘My Lord will crush them to fine dust"
  20,106,and reduce them to a desolate waste
  20,107,with no hollows nor jutting mounds to be seen.‘
  20,108,"On that day men will follow their truthful summoner, their voices hushed before the Lord of Mercy; and you shall hear only the sound of marching feet"
  20,109,On that day no intercession will avail except from him that has received the sanction of the Merciful and whose word was pleasing to Him
  20,110,"He knows what is before them and behind them, but of Him they have no knowledge"
  20,111,"They will hang their heads with awe before the Living One, the Ever-existent. Those who are burdened with sin shall come to grief"
  20,112,but those who have believed and done good works shall fear no tyranny or injustice
  20,113,"And thus have We sent it down: a Koran in the Arabic tongue, and proclaimed in it warnings and threats, that they may fear God and be admonished"
