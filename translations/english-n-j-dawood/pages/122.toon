quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"When they listen to that which was revealed to the Apostle, you see their eyes overflow with tears as they recognize its Truth. They say: ‘Lord, we believe. Count us among the witnesses"
  5,84,Why should we not believe in God and in the Truth that has come down to us? Why should we not hope our Lord will admit us among the righteous?‘
  5,85,"And for their words God has rewarded them with Gardens watered by running brooks, wherein shall they abide for ever. Such is the recompense of the righteous"
  5,86,But those that disbelieve and deny Our revelations shall become the inmates of Hell
  5,87,"Believers, do not forbid the wholesome things which God made lawful for you. Do not transgress; God does not love the transgressors"
  5,88,"Eat of the lawful and wholesome things which God has given you. And fear God, in whom you do believe"
  5,89,"God will not take you to task for that which is inadvertent in your oaths. But He will take you to task over the oaths which you solemnly swear. The penance for a broken oath shall be the feeding of ten needy men with such food as you normally offer to your own people; or fitting them out with clothes; or the freeing of a slave. He that cannot afford any of these shall fast three days. In this way you shall atone for your broken oaths. Therefore be true to that which you have sworn. Thus God manifests to you His revelations, so that you may give thanks"
