quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,It is not for true believers ― men or women ― to order their own affairs if God and His apostle decree otherwise. He that disobeys God and His apostle strays grievously into error
  33,37,"You³ said to the man⁴ whom God and yourself have favoured: ‘Keep your wife and have fear of God.‘ You sought to hide in your heart what God was to reveal.¹ You were afraid of man, although it would have been more proper for you to fear God. And when Zayd divorced her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that it should become legitimate for true believers to wed the wives of their adopted sons if they had divorced them. God‘s will must needs be done"
  33,38,"No blame shall be attached to the Prophet for doing what is sanctioned for him by God. Such was the way of God with those who went before him: God‘s decrees are ever preordained"
  33,39,"those who convey God‘s commandments, fearing Him and fearing none besides God. Sufficient is God‘s reckoning"
  33,40,Muhammad is the father of no man among you.² He is the Apostle of God and the Seal of the Prophets. Surely God has knowledge of all things
  33,41,"Believers, be ever mindful of God"
  33,42,praise Him morning and evening
  33,43,"It is He and His angels that bless you, so that He may lead you from darkness to the light. To believers He is ever compassionate"
