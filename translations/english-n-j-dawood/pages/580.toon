  76,26,"in the night time bow to Him: and praise Him all night long"
  76,27,"Surely the unbelievers love this fleeting life too well, and leave behind them a heavy day of doom"
  76,28,"We created them, and endowed their limbs and joints with strength; but if We please, We can replace them by others like them"
  76,29,"This is indeed an Admonition. Let him that will, take the right path to his Lord"

  77,1,"BY THE gales, sent forth in swift succession"
  77,2,by the raging tempests
  77,3,and the rain-spreading winds
  77,4,by those that send down the revelations
  77,5,discerning good from evil
  77,6,and admonishing by plea and warning
  77,7,that which you are promised shall be fulfilled
  77,8,When the stars are blotted out
  77,9,when the sky is rent asunder
  77,10,and the mountains crumble into dust
  77,11,when the apostles are brought together on the appointed day ―
  77,12,when will all this be
  77,13,Upon the Day of Judgement
  77,14,Would that you knew what the Day of Judgement is
  77,15,On that day woe betide the disbelievers
  77,16,Did We not obliterate the early generations
  77,17,and cause the latter ones to follow them
  77,18,Thus shall We deal with the transgressors
  77,19,On that day woe betide the disbelievers
