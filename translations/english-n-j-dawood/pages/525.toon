quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  52,32,Or does their reason bid them say this? Or is it that they are wicked people
  52,33,"Or do they say: ‘He has invented it¹ himself‘? Indeed, they have no faith"
  52,34,"Let them produce a scripture like it, if what they say be true"
  52,35,Or were they created out of the void? Or were they their own creators
  52,36,Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Surely they have no faith
  52,37,"Or do they hold the treasures of your Lord, and have control absolute"
  52,38,Or have they a ladder by means of which they overhear Him? Let their eavesdropper bring a positive proof
  52,39,Is He to have the daughters and you² the sons
  52,40,"Or are you³ demanding payment of them, that they should fear to be weighed down with debts"
  52,41,Or have they knowledge of what is hidden? Can they write it down
  52,42,Or are they scheming? It is the unbelievers‘ schemes that shall come to nothing
  52,43,Or have they a deity other than God? Exalted be God above their idols
  52,44,"And if they saw a piece of heaven falling down, they would still say: ‘It is but a pile of clouds!‘"
  52,45,"So let them be, until they face the day when they shall stand dumbfounded"
  52,46,the day when their schemes shall be of no avail to them; and they shall not be helped
  52,47,"And besides this a scourge awaits the wrongdoers, though most of them do not know it"
  52,48,"Await with patience the judgement of your Lord: you are ever in Our sight. And give glory to your Lord when you rise"
