quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  29,46,"And be courteous when you argue with the People of the Book, except with those among them who do wrong. Say: ‘We believe in that which has been revealed to us and was revealed to you. Our God and your God is one. To Him we submit as Muslims.‘"
  29,47,"Thus have We revealed the Book to you. Those to whom We gave the Book believe in it, as do some of your own people. Only the unbelievers deny Our signs"
  29,48,"Never have you¹ read a book before this, nor have you ever transcribed one with your right hand. Had you done either, the unbelievers might have doubted"
  29,49,But to those who were given knowledge it is a veritable sign. Only the wrongdoers deny Our signs
  29,50,"They say: ‘Why have no signs been sent down to him by his Lord?‘ Say: ‘Signs are in the hands of God. My mission is only to give plain warning.‘"
  29,51,Is it not sufficient for them that We have revealed to you the Book for their instruction? Surely in this there is a blessing and an Admonition for true believers
  29,52,"Say: ‘Sufficient is God as my witness, and your witness. He knows all that is in the heavens and the earth. Those who believe in falsehood and deny God will surely be the losers.‘"
