quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,Lot‘s people disbelieved the apostles
  26,161,"Their kin Lot had said to them: ‘Will you not fear God"
  26,162,I am indeed your truthful apostle
  26,163,Fear God and follow me
  26,164,For this I demand of you no recompense; none can reward me except the Lord of the Universe
  26,165,Will you fornicate with the males of humans
  26,166,and eschew the wives whom God has created for you? Surely you are a sinful people
  26,167,"Lot,‘ they said, ‘desist or you shall be banished.‘"
  26,168,"He said: ‘I abhor your ways"
  26,169,"Lord, deliver me and my kin from their practices.‘"
  26,170,We delivered him and his kindred all
  26,171,save for one old woman who stayed behind
  26,172,and the others We utterly destroyed
  26,173,"We pelted them with rain, and evil was the rain which fell on those who were forewarned"
  26,174,Surely in that there was a sign. Yet most of them did not believe
  26,175,"Your Lord is the Mighty One, the Compassionate"
  26,176,The dwellers of the Forest¹ disbelieved the apostles
  26,177,"Shu‘aib had said to them: ‘Will you not fear God"
  26,178,I am indeed your truthful apostle
  26,179,Fear God and follow me
  26,180,"For this I demand of you no recompense: none can reward me except the Lord of the Universe"
  26,181,Give just measure and defraud none
  26,182,Weigh with even scales
  26,183,and do not cheat the people of what is rightly theirs; nor shall you corrupt the land with evil
