quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,23,"None can intercede with God save him who has received His sanction. When fear is banished from their hearts, they shall ask each other: ‘What has your Lord ordained?‘ ‘The Truth,‘ they shall answer. ‘He is the Most High, the Supreme One.‘"
  34,24,"Say: ‘Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?‘ Say: ‘God. Either we or you are right, or clearly in the wrong.‘"
  34,25,"Say: ‘You are not accountable for our sins, nor are we accountable for your actions"
  34,26,"Say: ‘Our Lord will bring us all together, then He will rightly judge between us. He is the All-knowing Judge.‘"
  34,27,"Say: ‘Show me those whom you have named with Him as partners. Never. God alone is the Almighty One, the Wise One.‘"
  34,28,"We have sent you forth to all mankind, so that you may give them joyful tidings and forewarn them. But the larger part of mankind have no knowledge"
  34,29,"And they ask: ‘When will this promise be fulfilled, if what you say be true?‘"
  34,30,"Say: ‘Your day is already appointed. Not for one hour can you hold it back, nor can you hurry it on.‘"
  34,31,"And the unbelievers say: ‘We will never believe in this Koran, nor in in what had come before it.‘ If only you could see the wrongdoers when they are brought before their Lord! Bandying charges with one another, those who were despised will say to those who deemed themselves mighty: ‘But for you, we would have been believers.‘"
