  22,47,They bid you hasten the scourge. And God will never fail His promise. Each day of your Lord‘s is like a thousand years in your reckoning¹

  22,49,"Say: ‘You people! I have been sent to warn you plainly"
  22,50,Those that accept the true faith and do good works shall be forgiven and richly provided for
  22,51,and those that seek to confute Our revelations shall be the tenants of Hell.‘
  22,52,Never have We sent a single prophet or apostle before you with whose wishes Satan did not tamper. But God abrogates the interjections of Satan and God confirms His own revelations. God is all-knowing and wise
  22,53,"He makes Satan‘s interjections a temptation for those whose hearts are tainted, whose hearts are hardened ― this is why the wrongdoers are in open schism ―"
  22,54,so that those who are endowed with knowledge may realize that this² is the Truth from your Lord and thus believe in it and humble their hearts towards Him. God will surely guide the faithful to a straight path
  22,55,"Yet will the unbelievers never cease to doubt it, until the Hour overtakes them unawares, or the scourge of a baleful day descends upon them"
