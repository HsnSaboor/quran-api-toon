quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  72,1,"SAY: ‘IT is revealed to me that a band of jinn listened and said: \"We have heard a wondrous Koran"
  72,2,giving true guidance. We believed in it and shall henceforth serve none besides Our Lord
  72,3,"He (exalted be the glory of our Lord!) has taken neither consort, nor son"
  72,4,The Blaspheming One among us has uttered a wanton falsehood against God
  72,5,"although we had supposed no man or jinnee could tell of God what is untrue.\"‘"
  72,6,"Some men have sought the help of jinn, but they misled them into further error"
  72,7,"Like you, they thought that God could never resurrect the dead"
  72,8,"We made our way to high heaven, and found it filled with mighty wardens and fiery comets"
  72,9,"We sat eavesdropping, but eavesdroppers find comets in wait for them"
  72,10,We know not whether this bodes evil to those on earth or if their Lord intends to guide them
  72,11,"Some among us are righteous, while others are not; we follow different ways"
  72,12,"We know we cannot escape on earth from God, nor can we elude His grasp by flight"
  72,13,"When we heard His guidance we believed in Him: he that believes in his Lord shall fear neither dishonesty nor injustice"
