quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  55,68,"Each planted with fruit-trees, the palm and the pomegranate"
  55,69,So which of your Lord‘s blessings would you deny
  55,70,In each there shall be virgins chaste and fair
  55,71,So which of your Lord‘s blessings would you deny
  55,72,"Dark-eyed virgins, sheltered in their tents"
  55,73,so which of your Lord‘s blessings would you deny
  55,74,whom neither man nor jinnee will have touched before
  55,75,So which of your Lord‘s blessings would you deny
  55,76,They shall recline on green cushions and fine carpets
  55,77,So which of your Lord‘s blessings would you deny
  55,78,"Blessed be the name of your Lord, the Lord of Majesty and Glory"
  56,1,WHEN THAT which is coming comes ―
  56,2,and no soul shall then deny its coming ―
  56,3,some shall be abased and others exalted
  56,4,When the earth shakes and quivers
  56,5,and the mountains crumble away
  56,6,and scatter abroad into fine dust
  56,7,you shall be divided into three multitudes
  56,8,those on the right (blessed shall be those on the right)
  56,9,those on the left (damned shall be those on the left)
  56,10,and those to the fore (foremost shall be those)
  56,11,Such are they that shall be brought near to their Lord
  56,12,in the Gardens of Delight
  56,13,a whole multitude from ages past
  56,14,and but a few from the latter ages
  56,15,They shall recline on jewelled couches
  56,16,face to face
