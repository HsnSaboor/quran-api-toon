  57,19,And those that believe in God and His apostles are the men of Truth who shall testify in their Lord‘s presence. They shall have their guerdon and their light. But those that disbelieve Our revelations and deny them are the heirs of Hell

  57,21,"Therefore vie for the pardon of your Lord, and for a Paradise as vast as heaven and earth, prepared for those who believe in God and His apostles. Such is the grace of God: He bestows it on whom He will. God‘s grace is infinite"

  57,23,"so that you may not grieve for the good things you miss, or be overjoyed at what you gain. God does not love the haughty, the vainglorious"
