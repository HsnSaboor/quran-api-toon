quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Your Lord knows that you² sometimes keep vigil well-nigh two-thirds of the night, and sometimes half or one-third of it, as do others among your followers. God measures the night and the day. He knows you³ cannot count it‘s length, and turned to you mercifully. Recite from the Koran as many verses as you are able; He knows that among you there are sick men and others roaming the land in search of God‘s bounty; and yet others fighting for the cause of God. Recite from it, then, as many verses as you are able. Attend to your prayers, render the alms levy, and give God a generous loan. Whatever good you do for your own souls you shall surely find it with God, ennobled and more richly rewarded. And implore God to forgive you; surely God is forgiving and compassionate"
  74,1,YOU THAT are wrapped up in your cloak
  74,2,arise and give warning
  74,3,Magnify your Lord
  74,4,purify your garments
  74,5,and keep away from uncleanness
  74,6,Bestow no favours expecting gain
  74,7,Be patient for your Lord‘s sake
  74,8,The day the Trumpet sounds
  74,9,shall be a hard
  74,10,and joyless day for the unbelievers
  74,11,Leave to Me the man whom I created helpless
  74,12,and endowed with vast riches
  74,13,and thriving children
  74,14,I have made his progress smooth and easy
  74,15,yet he greedily hopes that I shall give him more
  74,16,By no means! Because he has stubbornly denied Our revelations
  74,17,I will lay on him a mounting torment
