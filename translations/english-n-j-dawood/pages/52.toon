quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,16,"those who say: ‘Lord, we do believe: forgive us our sins and keep us from the torment of the Fire‘"
  3,17,"who are steadfast, sincere, obedient, and charitable; and who implore forgiveness at break of day"
  3,18,"God bears witness that there is no god but Him, and so do the angels and the sages; the Executor of Justice, the Only God; the Almighty, the Wise One"
  3,19,"The only religion in God‘s sight is Islam. Those to whom the Book was given dissented, through insolence, only after knowledge had been vouchsafed them. He that denies God‘s revelations should know that swift is God‘s reckoning"
  3,20,"If they argue with you, say: ‘I have submitted my face to God and so have those that follow me.‘ And to those who were given the Book and to the Gentiles say: ‘Will you submit to God?‘ If they embrace Islam, they shall be rightly guided; if they pay no heed, then your only duty is to warn them. God is ever observant of His creatures"
  3,21,"Those that deny God‘s revelations, and slay the prophets unjustly, and kill those among the people who preach fair dealing ― warn them of a woeful scourge"
  3,22,"Their works shall come to nothing in this world and in the world to come, and there shall be none to help them"
