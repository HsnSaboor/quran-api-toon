quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  70,40,I swear by the Lord of the easts and of the wests that We have the power
  70,41,"to replace them by others better than they: nothing can hinder us from so doing"
  70,42,"So let them paddle, let them play until they face the day they are promised"
  70,43,the day when they shall rush headlong from their graves
  70,44,"like men rallying to a standard, with downcast eyes and countenances distorted and abject. Such is the day they are promised"
  71,1,"WE SENT forth Noah to his people, saying: ‘Give warning to your people before a woeful scourge overtakes them.‘"
  71,2,"He said: ‘My people, I come to warn you clearly"
  71,3,"Worship God and fear Him, and obey me"
  71,4,"He will forgive you some of your sins and give you respite to an appointed time. When God‘s time is come, none shall put it back. Would you but knew!‘"
  71,5,"Lord,‘ said Noah, ‘night and day have I pleaded with my people"
  71,6,but my pleas have only aggravated their aversion
  71,7,"Each time I call on them to seek Your pardon, they thrust their fingers into their ears and draw their cloaks over their heads, persisting in sin and bearing themselves with insolent pride"
  71,8,Then I called out loud to them
  71,9,and appealed to them in public and in private
  71,10,"Seek forgiveness of your Lord,\" I said. \"He is ever ready to forgive"
