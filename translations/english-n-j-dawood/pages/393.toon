quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  28,60,That which you have been given is but the enjoyment and the gaudy show of this present life. Better is God‘s recompense and more lasting. Have you no sense to reason with
  28,61,"Can he who has received Our gracious promise, and will see it fulfilled, be compared with him to whom We have given the enjoyment of this life and who will be summoned on the Day of Resurrection"
  28,62,"On that day He will call to them, saying: ‘Where are the gods whom you alleged to be My partners?‘"
  28,63,"Those on whom the Judgement has been passed will say: ‘Lord, these are the men whom we misled. We led them astray as we ourselves were led astray. We disown them before You; it was not us that they worshipped.‘"
  28,64,"Then they will be told: ‘Call on your idols!‘ And they will call on them, but they shall get no answer. They shall behold the scourge and wish that they were rightly guided"
  28,65,"On that day He will call to them, saying: ‘What answer did you give those who were sent?‘"
  28,66,And on that day they will be so confused that they will ask no questions
  28,67,But those that repented and embraced the Faith and did what was right may hope for salvation
  28,68,"Your Lord creates what He will and chooses freely, but they have no power to choose. Glorified and exalted be He above their false gods"
  28,69,And your Lord knows what their bosoms hide and what they say in public
  28,70,"He is God: there is no god but Him. Praise is His in the first world and in the last. His is the Judgement, and to Him shall you be recalled"
