quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,71,"People of the Book! Why do you confound Truth with the falsehood, and knowingly hide the Truth"
  3,72,"Some of the People of the Book say: ‘Believe in that which is revealed to the faithful in the morning and deny it at the end of the day, so that they may recant"
  3,73,"Believe in none except those that follow your own religion.‘ (Say: ‘The only guidance is God‘s guidance!‘) ‘Do not believe that anyone will be given the like of that which you were given, or that they will ever dispute with you in your Lord‘s presence.‘ Say: ‘Grace is in the hands of God: He bestows it on whom He will. And God is munificent and all-knowing"
  3,74,He is merciful only to whom He will. God is He whose grace is infinite.‘
  3,75,"Among the People of the Book there are some who, if you trust them with a heap of gold, will return it to you intact; and some who, if you trust them with one dinar, will not hand it back unless you demand it with importunity. For they say: ‘We are not bound to keep faith with Gentiles.‘ And they knowingly utter falsehood against God"
  3,76,"Indeed, those that are true to their covenant and fear God know that God loves those that fear Him"
  3,77,"Those that sell God‘s covenant and their own oaths for a paltry price shall have no share in the world to come. God will neither speak to them nor look at them on the Day of Resurrection; nor will He purify them: woeful punishment awaits them"
