quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,ABOUT WHAT are they asking
  78,2,About the fateful tidings ―
  78,3,the theme of their disputes
  78,4,But they shall learn
  78,5,then they shall surely learn
  78,6,Did We not spread the earth like a bed
  78,7,and raise the mountains like supporting pillars
  78,8,We created you in pairs
  78,9,and gave you rest in sleep
  78,10,We made the night a mantle
  78,11,and ordained the day for work
  78,12,We built above you seven mighty heavens
  78,13,and placed in them a glowing lamp
  78,14,We sent down abundant water from the clouds
  78,15,to bringing forth grain and varied plants
  78,16,and gardens thick with foliage
  78,17,Fixed is the Day of Judgement
  78,18,"On that day the Trumpet shall be blown, and you shall come in multitudes"
  78,19,The gates of heaven shall swing Open
  78,20,and the mountains shall pass away into a mirage
  78,21,Hell will lie in ambush
  78,22,a home for the transgressors
  78,23,Therein shall they abide long ages
  78,24,therein they shall taste neither refreshment nor any drink
  78,25,save scalding water and decaying filth
  78,26,a fitting recompense
  78,27,They never expected a reckoning
  78,28,and roundly denied Our revelations
  78,29,But We kept account of what they did and wrote it down
  78,30,"So taste this: for We shall give you nothing but mounting torment!‘"
