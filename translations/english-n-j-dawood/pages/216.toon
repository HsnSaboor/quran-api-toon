quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,62,But surely the servants of God have nothing to fear or to regret
  10,63,Those that have faith and fear Him
  10,64,"shall rejoice both in this life and in the life to come: the words of God shall never change. That is the supreme triumph"
  10,65,Let not their words grieve you. All glory belongs to God; He it is who hears all and knows all
  10,66,Surely to God belong all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth. Those that follow what they call gods besides God follow nothing but idle fancies and preach nothing but falsehoods
  10,67,He it is who has ordained the night for you to rest in and given the day its light for you to see with. Surely in this there are signs for attentive people
  10,68,"They say: ‘God has begotten a son.‘ Glory be to Him! Self-sufficient is He. His is all that the heavens and the earth contain. Have you any sanction for this? Would you say of God what you know not"
  10,69,"Say: ‘Those that invent falsehood about God shall not succeed"
  10,70,"They may take their ease in this life, but to Us they shall then return, and for their unbelief We will make them taste the grievous torment.‘"
