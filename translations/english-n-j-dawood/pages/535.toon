quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,and there shall wait on them immortal youths
  56,18,with bowls and ewers and a cup of purest wine
  56,19,that will neither pain their heads nor take away their reason
  56,20,with fruits of their own choice
  56,21,and flesh of fowls that they relish
  56,22,And theirs shall be the dark-eyed houris
  56,23,chaste as virgin pearls
  56,24,a guerdon for what they did
  56,25,"There they shall hear no idle talk, no sinful speech"
  56,26,"but only the greeting, ‘Peace! Peace!‘"
  56,27,Those on the right hand ― happy shall be those on the right hand
  56,28,They shall recline on couches raised on high in the shade of thornless sidrs
  56,29,and clusters of talh;¹
  56,30,And shade extended
  56,31,amidst gushing waters
  56,32,and abundant fruits
  56,33,"never-ending, unforbidden"
  56,34,"And [upon] beds raised high"
  56,35,We created the houris
  56,36,and made them virgins
  56,37,loving companions
  56,38,for those on the right hand
  56,39,a multitude from ages past
  56,40,and a multitude from the latter ages
  56,41,As for those on the left hand (wretched shall be those on the left hand)
  56,42,they shall dwell amidst scorching winds and seething water
  56,43,in the shade of pitch-black smoke
  56,44,neither cool nor refreshing
  56,45,For they have lived in comfort
  56,46,"and persisted in the heinous sin², saying"
  56,47,"What! When we are dead and turned to dust and bones, shall we be raised to life"
  56,48,"And our forefathers, too?‘"
  56,49,"Say: ‘Those from ages past, and those from latter ages"
  56,50,shall be brought together at the time of on an appointed day
