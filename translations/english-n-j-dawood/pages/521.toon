quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  51,7,By the heaven with its starry highways
  51,8,the words you utter are inconsistent
  51,9,None but the perverse turn away from the Truth
  51,10,Perish the liars
  51,11,who dwell in darkness and are heedless of the life to come
  51,12,When will the Day of Judgement be?‘ they ask
  51,13,On that day they shall be scourged in the Fire
  51,14,"Taste this, the punishment you sought to hasten!‘"
  51,15,The righteous shall dwell amidst gardens and fountains
  51,16,and shall receive what their Lord will give them. For they did good works before
  51,17,sleeping but little in the night-time
  51,18,praying at dawn for God‘s pardon
  51,19,and sharing their goods with the beggars and the dispossessed
  51,20,On earth there are signs for firm believers
  51,21,and in your own souls. Can you not see
  51,22,Heaven holds your sustenance and all that you are promised
  51,23,"I swear by the Lord of heaven and earth that this is true, as true as you are speaking now"
  51,24,Have you heard the story of Abraham‘s honoured guests
  51,25,"They went in to him and said: ‘Peace!‘ ‘Peace!‘ he said and, seeing that they were strangers"
  51,26,betook himself to his family and returned with a fatted calf
  51,27,"He placed it before them, saying: ‘Will you not eat?‘"
  51,28,"He grew afraid of them, but they said, ‘Have no fear,‘ and told him he was to have a son endowed with knowledge"
  51,29,"His wife came crying and beating her face. ‘Surely I am a barren old woman,‘ she said"
  51,30,"Such is the will of your Lord,‘ they said. ‘He surely is the Wise One, the All-knowing.‘"
