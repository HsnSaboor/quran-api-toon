quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Mark the words of him who denies Our signs and who yet boasts: ‘I shall surely be given wealth and children!‘"
  19,78,Has the future been revealed to him? Or has the Merciful made him such a promise
  19,79,By no means! We will record his words and make his punishment long and terrible
  19,80,All he speaks of he shall leave behind and come before us all alone
  19,81,They have chosen deities other than God to help them. By no means
  19,82,They will renounce their worship and turn against them
  19,83,Behold how We send down to the unbelievers demons who incite them to evil
  19,84,"Therefore do not hurry them on: their days are numbered"
  19,85,The day will surely come when We will gather the righteous in multitudes before the Lord of Mercy
  19,86,and drive the guilty to Hell in thirsty hordes
  19,87,None has power to intercede for them save him who has received the sanction of the Merciful
  19,88,"And they say: ‘The Lord of Mercy has begotten a son.‘"
  19,89,You surely preach a monstrous falsehood
  19,90,"at which the very heavens might crack, the earth split asunder, and the mountains crumble to dust"
  19,91,That they should ascribe a son to the Merciful
  19,92,when it does not become the Merciful to beget offspring
  19,93,There is none in the heavens or on earth but shall return to the Merciful in utter submission
  19,94,He has kept strict count of them all
  19,95,and one by one shall they come to Him on the Day of Resurrection
