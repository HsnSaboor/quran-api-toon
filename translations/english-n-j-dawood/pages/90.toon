quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,75,"And how should you not fight for the cause of God, and for the helpless old men, women, and children¹ who say: ‘Deliver us, Lord, from this city of wrongdoers; send forth to us a guardian from Your presence; send to us from Your presence one that will help us‘"
  4,76,"The true believers fight for the cause of God, but the infidels fight for the devil. Fight then the friends of Satan; Satan‘s cunning is weak indeed"
  4,77,"Mark those who were told: ‘Lay down your arms; recite your prayers and render the alms levy.‘ When they were ordered to fight, some of them feared man as much as they feared God or even more. ‘Lord,‘ they said, ‘why do You bid us fight? Could you not give us a brief respite?‘ Say: ‘Trifling are the pleasures of this life. Better is the life to come for those who fear God. You shall not be wronged by as much as the husk of a date-stone"
  4,78,"Wherever you may be, death will overtake you: though you put yourselves in lofty towers.‘ When they are blessed with good fortune, they say: ‘This is from God.‘ But when evil befalls them, they say: ‘It was your² fault.‘ Say: ‘All is from God!‘ What has come over these people that they can hardly understand a word"
  4,79,"Whatever good befalls you,³ it is from God: and whatever ill befalls you it is from yourself. We have sent you forth as an apostle to mankind. Sufficient is God as a witness"
