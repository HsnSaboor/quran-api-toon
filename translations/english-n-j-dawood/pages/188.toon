quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,7,"How can God and His apostle repose trust in idolaters, save those with whom you have made treaties at the Sacred Mosque? So long as they keep faith with you, keep faith with them. God loves the righteous"
  9,8,"How can you trust them? If they prevail against you, they will respect neither treaties nor ties of kin. They flatter you with their mouths, but their hearts reject you; and most of them are ungodly"
  9,9,They sell God‘s revelations for paltry price and debar others from His path. Evil is what they do
  9,10,they break faith with the believers and set at nought all ties of kin. Such are the transgressors
  9,11,"If they repent and take to prayer and render the alms levy, they shall become your brothers in the Faith. Thus do We expound Our revelations to those endowed with knowledge"
  9,12,"But if, after coming to terms with you, they break their oaths, and revile your religion, then fight the leaders of unbelief ― for no oaths are binding for them ― so that they may desist"
  9,13,"Will you not fight against those who have broken their oaths and conspired to banish the Apostle? They were the first to attack you. Do you fear them? Surely God is more deserving of your fear, if you are true believers"
