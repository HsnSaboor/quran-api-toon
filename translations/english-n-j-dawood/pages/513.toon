quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  48,16,"Say to those of the desert Arabs who stayed behind: ‘You shall be called upon to fight a people possessed of overwhelming might, unless they willingly embrace Islām. If you prove obedient, God will reward you well. But if you turn away, as you did turn away from this, He will inflict on you a woeful punishment.‘"
  48,17,"It shall be no offence for the blind, no offence for the lame, and no offence for the sick to stay behind. He that obeys God and His apostle shall be admitted into Gardens watered by running brooks; but on him that turns and flees He will inflict a woeful punishment"
  48,18,"God was well pleased with the faithful when they swore allegiance to you under the tree; He knew what was in their hearts. Therefore He sent down the Divine Presence¹ upon them, and rewarded them with a speedy victory"

  48,20,"God has promised you abundant spoils to take, and has given you this² with all promptness. He has stayed your enemies‘ hands, so that He may make your victory a sign to true believers and guide you along a straight path"
  48,21,And God knows of other spoils which you have not yet taken. God has power over all things
  48,22,"If the unbelievers join battle with you, they shall be put to flight. They shall find none to protect or help them"
  48,23,"Such was the way of God in days gone by: nor shall you ever find change in the way of God"
