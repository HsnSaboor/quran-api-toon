  30,51,"Yet if We let loose a searing wind, and they beheld their crops turn yellow, they would after that persist in unbelief"
  30,52,"You surely cannot make the dead hear you, nor can you make the deaf hear your call if they turn their backs and pay no heed"
  30,53,"nor can you guide the blind out of their error. None shall give ear to you save those who believe in Our revelations, and are now Muslims"
  30,54,"God creates you weak: after weakness He gives you strength, and after strength infirmity and grey hairs. He creates whatever He will: He is the Omniscient, the Almighty"
  30,55,"On the day the Hour strikes, the wrongdoers will swear that they had lingered but one hour. Thus are they ever deceived"
  30,56,"But those to whom knowledge and faith have been given will say: ‘You lingered there, as God ordained, till the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day of Resurrection: yet you did not know it.‘"
  30,57,"On that day their pleas shall not avail the wrongdoers, nor shall they be asked to make amends"
  30,58,"In this Koran we have set forth for people all manner of arguments. Yet if you recite to them a single verse, the unbelievers will surely say: ‘You preach nothing but falsehoods.‘"
  30,59,Thus God seals the hearts of the ignorant
  30,60,Therefore have patience. God‘s promise is true. Let not those who disbelieve drive you to despair
