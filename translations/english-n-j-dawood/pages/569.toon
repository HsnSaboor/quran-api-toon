quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,To redeem himself from the torment of that day the sinner will gladly sacrifice his children
  70,12,"his consort, his brother"
  70,13,the kin who gave him shelter
  70,14,"and all that are on the earth, if then this might deliver him"
  70,15,But no! The fire of Hell
  70,16,shall drag him down by the scalp
  70,17,shall claim him who had turned his back
  70,18,and amassed riches and covetously hoarded them
  70,19,"Indeed, man was created impatient"
  70,20,When evil befalls him he is despondent
  70,21,"but, blessed with good fortune, he grows niggardly"
  70,22,Not so the worshippers
  70,23,who are steadfast in prayer
  70,24,who set aside a due portion of their wealth
  70,25,for the beggar and for the dispossessed
  70,26,who truly believe in the Day of Reckoning
  70,27,and dread the punishment of their Lord
  70,28,for none is secure from the punishment of their Lord
  70,29,who restrain their carnal desire
  70,30,"save with their wives and slave-girls, for with these they are blameless"
  70,31,transgressors are those who lust after other than these
  70,32,who keep their trusts and promises
  70,33,and bear true witness
  70,34,and who attend to their prayers with promptitude
  70,35,"These shall be laden with honours, in fair Gardens"
  70,36,"But what has befallen the unbelievers, that they scramble towards you"
  70,37,in multitudes from right and left
  70,38,Are they each seeking to enter a Garden of Delight
  70,39,No! Of what We created them they know full well
