quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,No intercessor‘s plea shall save them
  74,49,Why then do they turn away from this reminder
  74,50,like frightened asses
  74,51,fleeing from a lion
  74,52,"Indeed, each one of them demands a scripture of his own to be unrolled before him"
  74,53,"No, they have no fear of the Hereafter"
  74,54,No! This is an Admonition
  74,55,"Let him who will, be admonished"
  74,56,But none is admonished except by the will of God. It is God who is the Lord of Goodness and Forgiveness
  75,1,I SWEAR by the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,and by the self-reproaching soul
  75,3,Does man think We shall never put his bones together again
  75,4,"Indeed, We can remould his very fingers"
  75,5,Yet man would ever deny what is to come
  75,6,"‘When will this be,‘ he asks, ‘this Day of Resurrection?‘"
  75,7,But when the sight of mortals is confounded
  75,8,and the moon eclipsed
  75,9,when sun and moon are joined together
  75,10,"on that day man will ask: ‘Whither shall I flee?‘"
  75,11,"No, there shall be no refuge"
  75,12,"for to your Lord, on that day, all shall be restored"
  75,13,"Indeed, man shall on that day be told of all he did, from first to last"
  75,14,"Indeed, man shall bear witness against himself"
  75,15,plead as he may with his excuses
  75,16,You¹ need not move your tongue too fast to learn this revelation
  75,17,We Ourself shall see to its collection and recital
  75,18,"When We read it, follow its words attentively"
  75,19,We shall Ourself explain its meaning
