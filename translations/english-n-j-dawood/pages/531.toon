quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,"We command but once: Our will is done in the twinkling of an eye"
  54,51,"We have destroyed many a people like yourselves: is there any that will remember"
  54,52,All they did is in the Scriptures
  54,53,"every action, small or great, is noted down"
  54,54,The righteous shall dwell in Gardens watered by running brooks
  54,55,honourably seated in the presence of a Mighty King
  55,1,IT IS the Merciful
  55,2,who has taught the Koran
  55,3,He created man
  55,4,and taught him articulate speech
  55,5,The sun and the moon pursue their ordered course
  55,6,The plants and the trees bow down in adoration
  55,7,The heaven He raised on high and set the Balance of all things
  55,8,that you might not transgress that Balance

  55,10,And the earth He laid for His creatures
  55,11,with all its fruits and blossom-bearing palm

  55,14,He created man from potter‘s clay
  55,15,and the jinn from smokeless fire
  55,16,So which of your Lord‘s blessings would you deny
