quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,54,"To redeem itself then, each soul would gladly give all that the earth contains if it possessed it. They will rue in secret when they behold the scourge; but judgement shall be fairly passed upon them; they shall not be wronged"
  10,55,"Surely to God belongs all that the heavens and the earth contain. Surely the promise of God is true, but most of them have no knowledge"
  10,56,"He it is who ordains life and death, and to Him shall you be recalled"
  10,57,"You people! An Admonition has come to you from your Lord, a cure for the mind, a guide and a blessing to the believers"
  10,58,"Say: ‘In God‘s grace and mercy let them rejoice, for these are better than the worldly riches they amass.‘"
  10,59,"Say: ‘Do but consider the provision God has sent down for you. Some of it you pronounced unlawful and some, lawful.‘ Say: ‘Was it God who gave you leave, or do you invent falsehood about God?‘"
  10,60,"What will they think, those who invent falsehood about God, on the Day of Resurrection? God is bountiful to mankind: yet most of them do not give thanks"
  10,61,"You shall engage in no affair, you shall recite no verse from the Koran, you shall commit no act, but We shall be witnesses over you when you engage in it. Not an atom‘s weight in earth or heaven escapes your Lord, nor is there any object smaller or greater, but is recorded in a veritable Book"
