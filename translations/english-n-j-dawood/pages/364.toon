quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,44,"Or do you think most of them can hear or understand? They are but like cattle; indeed, even more misguided"
  25,45,Do you not see how your Lord lengthens the shadow? Had it been His will He could have made it constant. But We make the sun its guide
  25,46,little by little We shorten it
  25,47,"And He it was who made the night a mantle for you, and sleep a rest. He made each day a resurrection"
  25,48,And He it is who drives the winds as harbingers of His mercy; and We send down pure water from the sky
  25,49,so that We may give life to a dead land and quench the thirst of countless beasts and men We have created
  25,50,"We have made it flow freely among them, that they may remember. Yet most decline to render thanks"
  25,51,"And had it been Our will, We could have sent to every city someone to give warning"
  25,52,"So do not yield to the unbelievers, but fight them vigorously with this.¹"
  25,53,"And He it was who sent the two seas rolling, the one sweet and fresh, the other salt and bitter, and set a rampart between them, an insurmountable barrier"
  25,54,"And He it was who created man from water, and gave him kin of blood and of marriage. All-powerful is your Lord"
  25,55,Yet they worship idols which can neither help nor harm them. Surely the unbeliever is an enemy to his Lord
