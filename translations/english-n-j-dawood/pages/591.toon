quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,"BY THE heaven, and by the nightly visitant"
  86,2,Would that you knew what the nightly visitant is
  86,3,It is the star of piercing brightness
  86,4,For every soul there is a guardian
  86,5,Let man reflect from what he is created
  86,6,he was created from an ejaculated fluid
  86,7,that issues from between the loins and the ribs
  86,8,Surely He has power to bring him back
  86,9,on the day when consciences are searched
  86,10,"Helpless shall he be, with none to succour him"
  86,11,By the heaven with its recurring cycles
  86,12,"and by the earth, ever bursting with new growth"
  86,13,this¹ is a discerning utterance
  86,14,no flippant jest
  86,15,They scheme and scheme
  86,16,"and I, too, scheme and scheme"
  86,17,"Therefore bear with the unbelievers, and let them be awhile"
  87,1,"PRAISE THE Name of your Lord, the Most High"
  87,2,who created all things and gave them due proportion
  87,3,who has ordained their destinies and guided them
  87,4,who brings forth the green pasture
  87,5,then turns it to withered grass
  87,6,"We shall make you read, so that you shall never forget"
  87,7,"except as God pleases. He has knowledge of the manifest, and the hidden"
  87,8,We shall guide you to the smoothest path
  87,9,"Therefore admonish, if admonishment will avail"
  87,10,He that fears God will pay heed
  87,11,but the wretched sinner will flout it
  87,12,He shall burn in the gigantic Fire
  87,13,wherein shall he then neither die nor live
  87,14,Happy shall be he that keeps himself pure
  87,15,that remembers the name of his Lord and prays
