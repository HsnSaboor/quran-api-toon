quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,170,"If they are told: ‘Follow what God has revealed,‘ they say: ‘We will follow what our fathers practised,‘ even though their fathers understood nothing and had no guidance"
  2,171,"The unbelievers are like those that, call out to them as one may, can hear nothing but a shout and a cry. Deaf, dumb, and blind, they do not understand"
  2,172,"Believers, eat of the wholesome things with which We have provided you and give thanks to God, if it is Him you worship"
  2,173,"He has forbidden you carrion, blood, and the flesh of swine;¹ also any flesh that is consecrated other than in the name of God. But whoever is driven by necessity, intending neither to sin nor to transgress, shall incur no guilt. God is forgiving and compassionate"
  2,174,Those that suppress any part of the Book which God has revealed in order to gain some paltry end shall swallow nothing but fire into their bellies. On the Day of Resurrection God will neither speak to them nor purify them. Woeful punishment awaits them
  2,175,Such are those that barter guidance for error and forgiveness for punishment. How steadfastly they seek the Fire
  2,176,That is because God has revealed the Book with the Truth; those that disagree about it are in extreme schism
