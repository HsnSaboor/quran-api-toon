quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  22,73,"You people! Listen to this aphorism. Those whom you invoke besides God could never create a fly though they combined their forces. And if a fly stole aught from them, they could never retrieve it. Powerless is the supplicant, and powerless he whom he supplicates"
  22,74,They do not render to God the homage due to Him; yet God is powerful and mighty
  22,75,God chooses emissaries from the angels and from people. Surely God hears all and observes all
  22,76,He knows what is before them and behind them. And to God shall all things be recalled
  22,77,"You that are true believers, kneel down and prostrate yourselves. Worship your Lord and do good works, so that you may succeed"
  22,78,"Fight for the cause of God with the devotion due to Him. He has chosen you, and laid on you no burdens in the observance of your Religion, the faith of your father Abraham. In this, as in former scriptures, He has given you the name of Muslims, so that the Apostle may testify against you, and that you may yourselves testify against people. Therefore attend to your prayers, render the alms levy, and hold fast to God; for He is your guardian. A gracious guardian and a gracious helper"
