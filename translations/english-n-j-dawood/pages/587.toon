quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,WHEN THE sky is rent asunder
  82,2,when the stars scatter
  82,3,and the oceans surge together
  82,4,when the graves are hurled about
  82,5,each soul shall know what it has done and what it has failed to do
  82,6,O man! What evil has enticed you from your gracious Lord
  82,7,"who created you, and gave you due proportions and an upright form"
  82,8,In whatever shape He willed He could have moulded you
  82,9,No! But you deny the Last Judgement
  82,10,Surely there are guardians watching over you
  82,11,noble recorders
  82,12,who know of what you do
  82,13,The righteous will surely be in bliss
  82,14,And the wicked shall be in Hell
  82,15,burning therein upon the Judgement-day
  82,16,nor shall they ever escape from it
  82,17,Would that you knew what the Day of Judgement is
  82,18,"Again, would that you knew what the Day of Judgement is"
  82,19,It is the day when no soul shall have the power to help another soul and God will reign supreme
  83,1,WOE BETIDE the unjust
  83,2,"who, when people measure for them, exact in full"
  83,3,"but when they measure or weigh for them, defraud them"
  83,4,Do they not think they will be raised to life
  83,5,upon a fateful day
  83,6,the day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the Universe
