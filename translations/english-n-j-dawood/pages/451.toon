quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"But they rejected him, and will thus be called to account"
  37,128,Not so God‘s true servants
  37,129,We bestowed on him the praise of later generations
  37,130,Peace be on Elias!‘
  37,131,Thus do We reward the righteous
  37,132,He was one of Our believing servants
  37,133,Lot also was one of those sent forth
  37,134,We delivered him and his kindred all
  37,135,except for an old woman who stayed behind
  37,136,and utterly destroyed the others
  37,137,You pass by their ruins in the morning
  37,138,"and at night: have you no sense"
  37,139,Jonah was also one of those sent forth
  37,140,He fled to the laden ship
  37,141,"cast lots, and was condemned"
  37,142,"The whale swallowed him, for he had sinned"
  37,143,and had he not devoutly praised the Lord
  37,144,he would have stayed in its belly till the Day of Resurrection
  37,145,"We cast him, gravely ill, upon a desolate shore"
  37,146,and caused a gourd-tree to grow over him
  37,147,"We sent him to a hundred thousand, or even more"
  37,148,"they believed in him, and We let them live in ease for a certain time"
  37,149,"Ask them if it be true that your Lord has daughters, and they sons"
  37,150,Or did We create the angels females; and were they witnesses
  37,151,Surely they lie when they assert
  37,152,God has given birth.‘
  37,153,"Would He choose daughters, rather than sons"
