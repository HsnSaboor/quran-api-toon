quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,21,"Thus did We reveal their secret, so that they might know that God‘s promise was true and that the Hour was not to be doubted. People argued among themselves concerning them. Some said: ‘Build a monument over their remains. Their Lord knows best who they were.‘ Those who were to win said: ‘Let us build a place of worship over them.‘"
  18,22,"Some will say: ‘They were three: their dog was the fourth.‘ Others, guessing at the unknown, will say: ‘They were five: their dog was the sixth.‘ And yet others: ‘Seven: their dog was the eighth.‘ Say: ‘My Lord best knows their number. Only a few know them.‘ Therefore, when you dispute about them, adhere only to that which is manifest and do not ask any of these concerning them"
  18,23,"Never say of anything: ‘I will do it tomorrow,‘"
  18,24,"without adding: ‘If God wills.‘ When you forget, remember your Lord and say: ‘May God guide me and bring me nearer to the Truth.‘"
  18,25,Some say they stayed in the cave three hundred years and nine
  18,26,"Say: ‘God knows best how long they stayed. His are the secrets of the heavens and the earth. Clear is His sight, and keen His hearing. They have no other guardian besides Him. He allows none to share His sovereignty.‘"
  18,27,Proclaim what has been revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. None can change His Words. And you shall find no refuge besides Him
