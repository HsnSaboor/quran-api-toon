quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"And the faithful say: ‘If only a sūrah were revealed!‘ But when a forthright sūrah is revealed and fighting is mentioned therein, you see the infirm of heart staring at you as though they are fainting away for fear of death"
  47,21,"Yet obedience and courteous speech would become them better. Indeed, should fighting be ordained, it would be better for them to be true to God"
  47,22,"If you¹ renounced the Faith, would you not do evil in the land and violate the ties of blood"
  47,23,"Such are those whom God has cursed, leaving them deaf and sightless"
  47,24,Will they not ponder on the Koran? Or are there locks upon their hearts
  47,25,Those who return to unbelief after God‘s guidance has been revealed to them are seduced by Satan and inspired by him
  47,26,"That is because they say to those who abhor the Word of God: ‘We shall obey you in some matters.‘ God knows their secret talk"
  47,27,"What will they do when the angels carry off their souls, striking their faces and their backs"
  47,28,"Because they follow what has provoked the ire of God and abhor what pleases Him, He will bring their works to nothing"
  47,29,Or do the feeble-hearted think that God will not reveal their malice
