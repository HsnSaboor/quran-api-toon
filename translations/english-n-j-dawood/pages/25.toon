  2,164,"Surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the alternation of night and day; in the ships that sail the ocean with cargoes beneficial to mankind; in the water which God sends down from the sky and with which He revives the earth after its death, dispersing over it all manner of beasts; in the disposal of the winds, and in the clouds that are driven between sky and earth: surely in these there are signs for rational people"
  2,165,"And yet there are some who worship idols, bestowing on them the adoration due to God (though the love of God is stronger in the faithful). But when they face their punishment the wrongdoers will learn that might is God‘s alone, and God is stern in retribution"
  2,166,"When they face their punishment those who were followed will disown their followers, and the bonds which now unite them will break asunder"
  2,167,"Those who followed them will say: ‘Could we but live again, we would disown them as they have now disowned us.‘ Thus will God show them their own works. They shall sigh with remorse, but shall never emerge from the Fire"
  2,168,"You people! Eat of what is lawful and wholesome on the earth and do not walk in Satan‘s footsteps, for he is your veritable foe"
  2,169,"He enjoins on you evil and lewdness, and bids you assert about God what you know not"
