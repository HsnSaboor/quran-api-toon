quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  44,40,The Day of Judgement is the appointed time for them all
  44,41,On that day no friend shall help a friend; none shall be helped
  44,42,"save those to whom God shows mercy. He is the Mighty One, the Compassionate"
  44,43,The Zaqqūm tree
  44,44,shall provide the sinner‘s food
  44,45,Like dregs of oil
  44,46,"like scalding water, it shall simmer in his belly"
  44,47,Seize him and drag him into the depths of Hell
  44,48,Then pour out the scourge of scalding water over his head
  44,49,"Taste this, you illustrious and honourable man"
  44,50,"This is the very fate you always doubted.\"‘"
  44,51,Surely the righteous shall be lodged in a mansion secure
  44,52,amid gardens and fountains face to face
  44,53,arrayed in rich silks and fine brocade
  44,54,Even thus; and We shall wed them to dark-eyed houris
  44,55,"Secure against all ills, they shall call for every kind of fruit"
  44,56,"and, having died once, they shall never die again. Your Lord will in His mercy shield them from the scourge of Hell"
  44,57,That will be the supreme triumph
  44,58,"We have made it easy in your own tongue, that they may remember"
  44,59,"Wait, then; they too are waiting"
