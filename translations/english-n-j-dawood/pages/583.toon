quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,"As for the righteous, there shall surely be a triumph"
  78,32,gardens and vineyards
  78,33,and tender-bosomed maidens for companions
  78,34,a truly overflowing cup
  78,35,"Therein shall they hear no idle talk, nor any falsehood"
  78,36,Such is the recompense of your Lord ― a gift that will suffice them
  78,37,"the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them; the Merciful, from whom they have no power to speak"
  78,38,"On the day when the Spirit and the angels stand up in their ranks, they shall not speak; except him who shall receive the sanction of the Merciful and declare what is right"
  78,39,"That day is sure to come. Let him who will, seek a way back to his Lord"
  78,40,"We have forewarned you of an imminent scourge: The day when man will look upon his works and the unbeliever say: ‘Would that I were dust!‘"
  79,1,BY THOSE who snatch away men‘s souls
  79,2,and those who gently release them
  79,3,by those who float at will
  79,4,and those who speed headlong
  79,5,by those who govern the affairs of this world
  79,6,On the day the Trumpet sounds
  79,7,its first and second blast
  79,8,hearts shall on that day be filled with terror
  79,9,and eyes shall stare with awe
  79,10,"They say: ‘When we are turned to hollow bones, shall we be restored to life?‘"
  79,11,Even if we should be decayed bones
  79,12,"And they say: ‘So it is a fruitless transformation!‘"
  79,13,But with one blast
  79,14,they shall return to the earth‘s surface
  79,15,Have you heard the story of Moses
