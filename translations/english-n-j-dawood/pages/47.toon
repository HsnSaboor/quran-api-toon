quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"Those that devour usury shall rise up before God like him that Satan has demented by his touch; for they claim that trading is no different from usury. But God has permitted trading and made usury unlawful. He that has received an admonition from his Lord and mended his ways may keep his previous gains; God will be his judge. Those that turn back shall be the inmates of the Fire, wherein they shall abide for ever"
  2,276,God has laid His curse on usury and blessed almsgiving with increase. God bears no love for the impious and the sinful
  2,277,"Those that believe and do good works, attend to their prayers and render the alms levy, shall be rewarded by their Lord and have nothing to fear nor to regret"
  2,278,"Believers, fear God and waive what is still due to you from usury, if your faith be true"
  2,279,"or war shall be declared against you by God and His apostle. If you repent, you may retain your principal, suffering no loss and causing loss to none"
  2,280,"If your debtor be in straits, grant him a delay until he can discharge his debt; but if you waive the sum as alms it will be better for you, if you but knew it"
  2,281,Fear the day when you shall all return to God; and then every soul shall be paid back for what it did. None shall be wronged
