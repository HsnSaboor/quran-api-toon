quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,Do you really believe
  37,53,"When we have died and turned to dust and bones, shall we ever be brought to judgement?\"‘"
  37,54,"And he will say: ‘Come, will you look down.‘"
  37,55,He will look down and see his friend in the very midst of Hell
  37,56,"By the Lord,‘ he will say, ‘you almost ruined me"
  37,57,But for the grace of my Lord I should have surely been summoned myself
  37,58,Shall we never die again
  37,59,"having died once, and shall we never be scourged at all?‘"
  37,60,Surely that is the supreme triumph
  37,61,To this end let everyone labour
  37,62,Is this not a better welcome than the Zaqqūm tree
  37,63,We have made this tree a scourge for the unjust
  37,64,It grows in the nethermost part of Hell
  37,65,bearing fruit like demons‘ heads
  37,66,"on it they shall feed, and with it they shall cram their bellies"
  37,67,together with draughts of scalding water
  37,68,Then to Hell shall they surely return
  37,69,They found their fathers erring
  37,70,yet they eagerly followed in their footsteps
  37,71,Most of the ancients went astray before them
  37,72,though We had sent emissaries to give them warning
  37,73,So consider the fate of those who had been warned
  37,74,except God‘s true servants
  37,75,"Noah called to Us, and he was graciously answered"
  37,76,"We delivered him, and his household, from the great calamity"
