quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,as they recline upon their couches and gaze around
  83,36,Shall not the infidels be rewarded according to what they did
  84,1,WHEN THE sky is rent apart
  84,2,obeying her Lord in true submission
  84,3,when the earth expands
  84,4,and casts out all that is within her and becomes empty
  84,5,obeying her Lord in true submission; then
  84,6,"O man, who labour constantly to meet your Lord, shall you meet Him"
  84,7,He that is given his book in his right hand
  84,8,shall have a lenient reckoning
  84,9,and shall go back rejoicing to his people
  84,10,But he that is given his book behind his back
  84,11,shall call down destruction on himself
  84,12,and burn in the Conflagration
  84,13,for he lived rejoicing among his people
  84,14,and thought he would never turn back
  84,15,Yes; but his Lord was ever watching him
  84,16,I swear by the glow of sunset
  84,17,"by the night, and all that it envelops"
  84,18,"by the moon, in her full perfection"
  84,19,that you shall march onwards from stage to stage
  84,20,Why then do they not believe
  84,21,or kneel down in prayer when the Koran is read to them
  84,22,The unbelievers indeed are in denial
  84,23,but God knows best the falsehoods they believe in
  84,24,Therefore proclaim to them a woeful scourge
  84,25,save those who believe and do good works; for theirs is an unfailing recompense
