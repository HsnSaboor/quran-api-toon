quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  58,7,"Are you not aware that God knows what the heavens and the earth contain? If three men confer in secret, He is their fourth; if five, He is their sixth; whether fewer or more, He is with them wherever they be. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of their doings. God has knowledge of all things"
  58,8,"Have you not seen those who, though forbidden to intrigue in secret, defiantly intrigue together in sin and enmity and in disobedience to the Apostle? When they come to you, they salute you in words which God does not greet you with, and ask themselves: ‘Why does God not punish us for what we say?‘ Hell is scourge enough for them: in its flames they shall burn, a wretched fate"
  58,9,"Believers, when you converse in private do not speak with wickedness and enmity and in disobedience to the Apostle, but with justice and with piety; and fear God, before whom you shall be herded"
  58,10,"Intrigue is the work of Satan, who means to vex the faithful. Yet he can harm them not at all, except by the will of God. In God let the faithful put their trust"
  58,11,"Believers, make room¹ in your assemblies when you are bidden so to do: God will make room for you hereafter. Again, rise up when you are told to rise: God will raise to high ranks those of you that believe and those endowed with knowledge. God is cognizant of what you do"
