quran[7]{c,v,t}:

  8,35,"Their prayers at the Sacred House are nothing but whistling and clapping of hands. ‘Taste then the scourge, because you disbelieved.‘"

  8,38,"Tell the unbelievers that if they mend their ways their past shall be forgiven; but if they relapse, then theirs shall be the fate of bygone nations"
  8,39,"Fight them until idolatry¹ shall cease and God‘s religion shall reign supreme.² If they desist, God is cognizant of what they do"
  8,40,"but if they pay no heed, know then that God is your protector; the noblest Protector and the noblest Helper"
