quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,THOSE WHO disbelieve and debar others from God‘s path He will bring their deed to nothing
  47,2,And the faithful who do good works and believe in what has been revealed to Muhammad ― which is the Truth from their Lord ― He will forgive their sins and ennoble their state
  47,3,"This, because the unbelievers follow falsehood, while the faithful follow the Truth from their Lord. Thus God lays down for mankind their rules of conduct"
  47,4,"When you meet the unbelievers strike off their heads and, when you have wrecked widespread slaughter among them, bind your captives firmly. Then either grant them their freedom or take a ransom from them, until War shall lay down her burdens. Thus shall you do. Had God willed, He could Himself have punished them; but thus shall it be that He may test you, the one by the other. As for those who are slain in the cause of God, He will not bring their deeds to nothing"
  47,5,He will vouchsafe them guidance and ennoble their estate
  47,6,He will admit them into the Paradise He has made known to them
  47,7,"Believers, if you help God, He will help you and make you strong"
  47,8,But the unbelievers shall be consigned to perdition. He will bring their deeds to nothing
  47,9,"Because they have abhorred God‘s revelations, He will frustrate their works"
  47,10,"Have they never journeyed through the land and seen what was the fate of those who have gone before them? God destroyed them utterly, and a similar fate awaits the unbelievers"
  47,11,"because God is the protector of the faithful: and because the unbelievers have no protector"
