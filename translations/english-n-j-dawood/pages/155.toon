quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,38,"He will say: ‘Enter, and join communities of jinn and humankind that have gone before you into the Fire.‘ As it enters, every community will curse the one that went before it, and when all are gathered there, the last of them will say of the first: ‘These, Lord, have led us astray. Let their punishment be doubled in the Fire.‘ He will say: ‘All shall be doubly punished, though you may know not.‘"
  7,39,"Then the first will say to the last: ‘You were no better than we. Taste then the torment, the penalty of your misdeeds.‘"
  7,40,For those that have denied and scorned Our revelations the gates of heaven shall not be opened; nor shall they enter Paradise until the camel shall pass through the eye of a sewing needle.¹ Thus shall We reward the transgressors
  7,41,"Hell shall be their couch, and sheets of fire shall cover them. Thus shall We requite the wrongdoers"
  7,42,"As for those that believe and do good works ― We never charge a soul with more than it can bear ― they are the heirs of Paradise, wherein shall they abide for ever"
  7,43,"We shall take away all rancour from their hearts. Rivers will roll at their feet and they shall say: ‘Praise be to God who has guided us hither. Had He not given us guidance we would not have been rightly guided. Our Lord‘s apostles have surely preached the Truth.‘ And a voice will cry out to them: ‘This is the Paradise you inherited for what you did.‘"
