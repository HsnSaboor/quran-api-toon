quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,90,But We have revealed to them the Truth; and they are surely lying
  23,91,"Never has God begotten a son, nor is there any other god besides Him. Were this otherwise, each god would govern his own creation, each holding himself above the other. Exalted be God above their falsehoods"
  23,92,He knows alike the unknown and the manifest. Exalted be He above the gods they serve besides Him
  23,93,"Say: ‘Lord, if You will indeed let me see the scourge they are promised"
  23,94,"do not abandon me, Lord, among these wrongdoing people.‘"
  23,95,"Indeed, We do have power enough to let you see the scourge We promise them"
  23,96,Requite evil with good. We know their slanders well
  23,97,"And say: ‘Lord, I seek refuge in You from the promptings of the demons"
  23,98,"Lord, I seek refuge in You from their presence.‘"
  23,99,"When death comes to one among them, he will say: ‘Lord, let me go back"
  23,100,that I may do good works in the world I have left behind.‘ Never! These are the very words which he will speak. Behind them there shall stand a barrier till the Day of Resurrection
  23,101,"And when the Trumpet is blown, on that day their ties of kin shall be broken, nor shall they ask help of one another"
  23,102,Those whose good deeds weigh heavy in the scales shall triumph
  23,103,but those whose good deeds are light shall forfeit their souls and abide in Hell for ever
  23,104,The fire will scorch their faces and they will writhe in anguish
