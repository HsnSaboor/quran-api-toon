quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  89,24,"He will say: ‘Would that I had been charitable in my lifetime!‘"
  89,25,But on that day none will punish as He will punish
  89,26,and none will bind with chains like His
  89,27,O serene soul
  89,28,"Return to your Lord, well pleased, and pleasing in His sight"
  89,29,Join My servants
  89,30,and enter My Paradise
  90,1,I SWEAR by this city
  90,2,and you¹ are a resident of this city
  90,3,by the begetter² and all whom he begot
  90,4,We created man to try him with affliction
  90,5,Does he think that none has power over him
  90,6,I have squandered vast riches!‘ he says
  90,7,Does he think that none observed him
  90,8,Have We not given him two eyes
  90,9,"a tongue, and two lips"
  90,10,and shown him the two paths
  90,11,Yet he would not scale the Height
  90,12,Would that you knew what the Height is
  90,13,It is the freeing of a slave
  90,14,"the feeding, in the day of famine"
  90,15,of an orphaned relation
  90,16,or a needy man in distress
  90,17,to have faith and to enjoin fortitude and mercy
  90,18,Such are those that shall stand on the right hand
  90,19,but those that deny Our revelations shall stand on the left
  90,20,with a Fire close above them
