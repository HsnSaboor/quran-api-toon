quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,BY THE sun and his midday brightness
  91,2,"by the moon, when she rises after him"
  91,3,"by the day, when it reveals his splendour"
  91,4,"by the night, when it veils him"
  91,5,By the heaven and Him that built it
  91,6,by the earth and Him that spread it
  91,7,by the soul and Him that moulded it and inspired it
  91,8,with knowledge of sin and piety
  91,9,blessed shall be he that has kept it pure
  91,10,and ruined he that has corrupted it
  91,11,In its presumptuous pride Thamūd denied their apostle
  91,12,when its arch-sinner rose against him
  91,13,"God‘s apostle said: ‘This is God‘s own she-camel. Let her drink.‘"
  91,14,"They disbelieved him, and hamstrung her. And for their sin their Lord let loose His scourge upon them and razed their city to the ground"
  91,15,He did not fear the consequences
  92,1,"BY THE night, when she lets fall her darkness"
  92,2,and by the radiant day
  92,3,By Him that created the male and the female
  92,4,your endeavours have varied ends
  92,5,For him that gives and fears God
  92,6,and believes in goodness
  92,7,We shall smooth the path of salvation
  92,8,but for him that gives nothing and strives to enrich himself
  92,9,and disbelieves in goodness
  92,10,We shall smooth the path of affliction
  92,11,"When he breathes his last, his riches will not avail him"
  92,12,It is for Us to give guidance
  92,13,"Ours is the life to come, Ours the life of this world"
  92,14,"I warn you, then, of a blazing Fire"
