  23,75,"And if We showed them mercy and relieved their misfortunes, they would persist in their insolent ways, ever straying blindly from the right path"
  23,76,"We punished them, but they neither entreated their Lord nor humbled themselves before Him"
  23,77,"And when We smote them with a grievous scourge, they yielded to utter despair"
  23,78,"He it was who gave you ears, eyes, and hearts: yet you are seldom thankful"
  23,79,"He it was who placed you on the earth, and before Him shall you be herded"
  23,80,"And He it is who ordains life and death, and He who alternates the night with the day. Can you not understand"
  23,81,Indeed they say what the ancients said before them
  23,82,"‘After our death, when we are dust and bones,‘ they say, ‘shall we be raised to life"
  23,83,"This we have been promised before, we and our forefathers. It is but a fable of the ancients.‘"

  23,85,"God‘s,‘ they will say. Say: ‘Then will you not reflect?‘"
  23,86,"Say: ‘Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, and of the Glorious Throne?‘"
  23,87,"God,‘ they will say. Say: ‘Will you not fear Him, then?‘"
  23,88,"Say: ‘In whose hands is the sovereignty of all things, protecting all, while against Him there is no protection? If you really know.‘"
  23,89,"In God‘s,‘ they will say. Say: ‘How then can you be so bewitched?‘"
