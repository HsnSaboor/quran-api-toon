quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,80,"And God has given you houses to dwell in, and has given you animals‘ skins for tents, that you may find them light when you travel and easy to pitch when you halt for shelter; while from their wool, fur, and hair, He has for a space of time provided you with comforts and domestic goods"
  16,81,"By means of that which He created, God has given you shelter from the sun; He has given you refuge in the mountains; He has given you garments to protect you from the heat, and coats of armour to shield you in your wars. Thus does He perfects His bounty to you, that you may turn to Islam"
  16,82,"But if theyˡ pay no heed, your² mission is only to give clear warning"
  16,83,"They recognize God‘s bounty, yet they deny it. And most of them surely are ungrateful"
  16,84,"On the day We call to life a witness from each community, their pleas shall not avail the unbelievers, nor shall they be allowed to make amends"
  16,85,"And when the wrongdoers face the scourge, it shall not be eased for them, nor shall they ever be reprieved"
  16,86,"When the pagans behold their idols, they will say: ‘Lord, these are the idols to whom we prayed.‘ But their idols will retort: ‘You are surely lying!‘"
  16,87,"They shall proffer God submission on that day, and the gods of their own invention will forsake them"
