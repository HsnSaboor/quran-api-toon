quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,And how can you disbelieve when God‘s revelations are recited to you and His own apostle is in your midst? He that holds fast to God shall surely be guided to a straight path
  3,102,"Believers, fear God as you rightly should, and die only as Muslims"
  3,103,"Cling one and all to the Faith¹ of God and never be divided. Remember the favour God has bestowed upon you: how, after your enmity, He united your hearts, so that you are now brothers through His grace; and how, when you were on the brink of an abyss of fire, He delivered you from it. God thus makes plain to you His revelations, that you may be rightly guided"
  3,104,"And of you let there become a community that shall call for righteousness, enjoin justice, and forbid the reprehensible. Such are those that will surely thrive"
  3,105,Do not follow the example of those who became divided and opposed to each other after veritable proofs had been given them. Grievous punishment awaits them
  3,106,"on the day when some faces will be bright with joy and others blackened. The black-faced will be asked: ‘Did you recant after embracing the true Faith? Taste then the scourge, for you were unbelievers!‘"
  3,107,"As for those whose faces will be bright, in God‘s mercy shall they abide for ever"
  3,108,Such are God‘s revelations; We recite them to you in Truth. God desires no injustice to mankind
