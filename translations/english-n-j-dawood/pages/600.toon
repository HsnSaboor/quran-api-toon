quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,and their once hidden thoughts are laid bare
  100,11,their Lord will on that day have full knowledge of them all
  101,1,THE DISASTER
  101,2,What is the Disaster
  101,3,Would that you knew what the Disaster is
  101,4,On that day people shall become like scattered moths
  101,5,and the mountains like tufts of carded wool
  101,6,Then he whose good deeds weigh heavy in the scales
  101,7,shall live in bliss
  101,8,but he whose good deeds are light
  101,9,the Abyss shall be his home
  101,10,Would that you knew what this is like
  101,11,It is a scorching fire
  102,1,YOUR HEARTS are taken up with worldly gain
  102,2,from the cradle to the grave
  102,3,No! But you shall learn
  102,4,No! You then shall surely learn
  102,5,No! If you knew the Truth with certainty
  102,6,you would witness Hell
  102,7,you would then witness it with the certainty of your very eyes
  102,8,"Then, on that day, you shall surely be questioned about your bliss"
