  7,31,"Children of Adam, dress well when you attend your mosques. Eat and drink, but do not indulge. He does not love the indulgent"
  7,32,"Say: ‘Who has forbidden you to wear the decent clothes or to eat the good things which God has provided for His servants?‘ Say: ‘These are for the enjoyment of the faithful in the life of this world, and they shall be theirs alone on the Day of Resurrection.‘ Thus do We expound Our revelations to those endowed with knowledge"
  7,33,"Say: ‘My Lord has forbidden all lewd acts, whether overt or disguised, sin, and wrongful oppression; and He has forbidden you to worship what He did not sanction, or to tell of God what you know not.‘"
  7,34,"Every community has a term decreed; when their time is come, not for one hour shall they hold it back, nor can they go before it"
  7,35,"Children of Adam, when apostles of your own come to proclaim to you My revelations, those that take warning and mend their ways will have nothing to fear or to regret"
  7,36,"but those that deny and scorn Our revelations shall be the inmates of the Fire, wherein shall they abide for ever"
  7,37,"Who is more wicked than he who invents a falsehood about God or denies His revelations? Those shall have their share as destined in the Book, and when Our emissaries come to claim back their souls they shall say: ‘Where are your idols now, those whom you invoked besides God?‘ ‘They have forsaken us,‘ they will say, and will impeach themselves as unbelievers"
