  6,1,"PRAISE BE to God, who created the heavens and the earth and ordained darkness and light. Yet the unbelievers set up other gods as equals with their Lord"
  6,2,He it is who has created you from clay. Then He decreed a term for you in this world and another specified by Him. Yet you are still in doubt
  6,3,God is He in the heavens and on earth. He knows what you conceal and what you reveal; He knows what you do
  6,4,"Yet every time a revelation comes to them from their Lord, they pay no need to it"
  6,5,"Thus do they deny the Truth when it is declared to them: but they shall learn the consequences of their scorn"
  6,6,"Can they not see how many generations We have destroyed before them? We had given them more power in the land than the power we have given you,¹ We sent down for them abundant water from the sky, and We gave them rivers that rolled at their feet. Yet because they sinned We obliterated them, and raised up other generations after them"
  6,7,"If We sent down to you a Book inscribed on real parchment and they touched it with their own hands, the unbelievers would still assert: ‘This is but sorcery manifest.‘"
  6,8,"And they ask: ‘Why has no angel been sent down to him?‘ If We had sent down an angel, judgement would have been passed and they would have never been reprieved"
