  15,16,And We have decked the sky with constellations and made them lovely to behold
  15,17,And We have guarded them from every cursed demon
  15,18,Eavesdroppers are pursued by fiery comets
  15,19,We have spread out the earth and set upon it immovable mountains
  15,20,"We have planted it with every seasonable fruit, providing sustenance for yourselves and for those you do not provide for"
  15,21,We hold the store of every blessing and send it down only in appropriate measure
  15,22,We let loose the fertilizing winds and bring down water from the sky for you to drink; its stores are beyond your reach
  15,23,It is surely We who ordain life and death; We are the Heir of all things
  15,24,"We surely know those who have gone before you, as we surely know those who will come hereafter"

  15,27,and before him Satan from smokeless fire
  15,28,"Your Lord said to the angels: ‘I am creating man from dry clay, from black moulded loam"
  15,29,"When I have fashioned him and breathed My spirit into him, kneel down and prostrate yourselves before him.‘"
