quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,in which none shall burn save the hardened sinner
  92,16,who disbelieves and turns away
  92,17,But the good man who keeps himself pure by almsgiving shall keep away from it
  92,18,and so shall he that does good works
  92,19,"for the sake of his Lord the Most High only, seeking no recompense"
  92,20,"But only seeking the countenance of his Lord, Most High"
  92,21,He will surely be well pleased
  93,1,BY THE light of day
  93,2,and by the night when she spreads her darkness
  93,3,"your Lord has not forsaken you,¹ nor does He abhor you"
  93,4,The life to come holds a richer prize for you than this present life
  93,5,and you shall be gratified with what your Lord will give you
  93,6,Did He not find you an orphan and give you shelter
  93,7,And did He not find you in error and guide you
  93,8,And did He not find you poor and enrich you
  93,9,Therefore do not wrong the orphan
  93,10,nor chide away the beggar
  93,11,But proclaim the goodness of your Lord
  94,1,HAVE WE not lifted up your heart
  94,2,and relieved you¹ of the burden
  94,3,which weighed down your back
  94,4,And have We not given you high renown
  94,5,With every hardship there comes ease
  94,6,With every hardship there comes ease
  94,7,When your prayers are ended resume your toil
  94,8,and seek your Lord with all fervour
