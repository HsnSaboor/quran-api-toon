  85,1,BY THE heaven with its constellations
  85,2,By the Promised Day
  85,3,"By the Witness, and that which is witnessed"
  85,4,Cursed¹ be the diggers of the trench
  85,5,with its consuming fire
  85,6,as they sat around it
  85,7,to witness what they did to the faithful
  85,8,"Nor did they avenge themselves on them for aught but that they believed in God, the Almighty, the Praised One"
  85,9,who has sovereignty over the heavens and the earth. And God is the Witness of all things
  85,10,"Those that persecute believers, men or women, and never repent shall have the torment of Hell, the torment of the blazing fire"
  85,11,But those that believe and do good works shall have Gardens watered by running brooks. That is the supreme triumph
  85,12,Stern indeed is the vengeance of your Lord
  85,13,He it is who brings into being and then restores to life
  85,14,Forgiving and loving
  85,15,He is the Lord of the Glorious Throne
  85,16,the Executor of His own will
  85,17,Have you not heard the story of the warriors
  85,18,of Pharaoh and of Thamūd
  85,19,Yet the unbelievers are still in denial
  85,20,God surrounds them from behind
  85,21,Surely this is a glorious Koran
  85,22,on a tablet preserved
