quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,Another sign for them is that We carried their offspring in the laden ark
  36,42,And similar vessels We have made for them to ride on
  36,43,"We drown them if We will: none can help or rescue them"
  36,44,except through Our mercy and unless enjoyment is allowed for a time
  36,45,"When they are told: ‘Have fear of that which is before you and behind you, that you may be shown mercy,‘"
  36,46,they turn away from every sign that comes to them from their Lord
  36,47,"And when they are told: ‘Give from that which God has given you,‘ the unbelievers say to the faithful: ‘Are we to feed those whom God can feed if He chooses? ‘Surely you are in glaring error.‘"
  36,48,"And they say: ‘When will this promise be fulfilled, if what you say be true?‘"
  36,49,"They must be waiting but for a single blast, which will take them while they are still disputing"
  36,50,"They will have no time to make a will, nor shall they return to their kin"
  36,51,"The Trumpet will be blown and, behold, from the graves they will stand before their Lord"
  36,52,"Woe betide us!‘ they will say. ‘Who has roused us from our resting-place? This is what the Lord of Mercy promised: the apostles have told the truth!‘"
  36,53,And with but one blast they shall be gathered all before Us
  36,54,On that day no soul shall suffer the least injustice. You shall be rewarded only according to your deeds
