quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,Yet you¹ prefer the life of this world
  87,17,although the life to come is better and more lasting
  87,18,This is surely set down in earlier Scriptures
  87,19,the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,HAVE YOU heard of the Event that shall overwhelm all
  88,2,On that day there shall be downcast faces
  88,3,haggard and worn out
  88,4,burnt by a scorching fire
  88,5,drinking from a seething fountain
  88,6,Their only food shall be bitter thorns
  88,7,which will neither sustain them nor satisfy their hunger
  88,8,On that day there shall be radiant faces
  88,9,well-pleased with their labours
  88,10,in a lofty Garden
  88,11,Therein shall they hear no idle talk
  88,12,therein shall be a gushing fountain
  88,13,therein shall be raised soft couches
  88,14,with goblets placed before them
  88,15,silken cushions ranged in order
  88,16,and carpets richly spread
  88,17,"Do they never reflect on the camels, how they were created"
  88,18,"On the heaven, how it was raised on high"
  88,19,"On the mountains, how they were set down"
  88,20,"On the earth, how it was flattened"
  88,21,Therefore admonish; Your duty is only to admonish
  88,22,you are not their keeper
  88,23,As for those that turn their backs and disbelieve
  88,24,God will torment them with the supreme torment
  88,25,To Us shall they return
  88,26,and then We will Ourselves bring them to account
