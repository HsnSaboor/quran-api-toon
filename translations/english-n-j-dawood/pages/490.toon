quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  43,11,"who sends down water from the sky in due measure and thereby We resurrect a dead land: even thus shall you be raised to life"
  43,12,who has created all living things in pairs and made for you the ships and beasts on which you ride
  43,13,"so that, as you rest upon their backs, you may recall the goodness of your Lord and say: ‘Glory to Him who has subjected these to us. But for Him we could not be their masters"
  43,14,To our Lord we shall surely return.‘
  43,15,Yet they¹ assign to Him some from among His servants. Surely man is monstrously ungrateful
  43,16,Would God choose daughters for Himself from what He created and favour you with sons?²
  43,17,And yet when the birth of a female is announced to any of them his countenance darkens and he is grievously vexed
  43,18,Or would they ascribe to God females who adorn themselves with trinkets and are powerless in disputation
  43,19,"They make females the angels who are the Merciful‘s servants: did they witness their creation? Their testimony shall be noted down; and they shall be closely questioned"
  43,20,"They say: ‘Had it been the will of the Merciful, we should never have worshipped them.‘ Surely of this they have no knowledge: they are only lying"
  43,21,"Or have We given them a scripture before this, so that they should hold fast to it"
  43,22,"Indeed, they say: ‘This was the faith our fathers practised; and we are merely guided by their footsteps.‘"
