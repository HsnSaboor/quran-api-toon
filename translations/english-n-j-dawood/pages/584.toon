quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,"His Lord called out to him in the sacred valley of Ţuwā, saying"
  79,17,"Go to Pharaoh: he has transgressed all bounds"
  79,18,"and say: \"Will you reform yourself"
  79,19,"I will guide you to your Lord, that you may have fear of Him.‘"
  79,20,He showed Pharaoh the mightiest sign
  79,21,but he denied it and rebelled
  79,22,He quickly went away and
  79,23,"summoning all his men, made to them a proclamation"
  79,24,‘I am your supreme Lord.‘ he said
  79,25,"So God smote him with the scourge of the life to come, and of this life"
  79,26,Surely in this there is a lesson for the God-fearing
  79,27,Are you harder to create or the heaven He has built
  79,28,He raised it high and fashioned it
  79,29,giving darkness to its night and brightness to its day
  79,30,After that He spread the earth
  79,31,"and, drawing water from its depth, brought forth its pastures"
  79,32,He set down the mountains
  79,33,for you and for your cattle to delight in
  79,34,But when the supreme calamity strikes ―
  79,35,the day when man will call to mind his labours ―
  79,36,when Hell appears to those with eyes to see ―
  79,37,he that transgressed
  79,38,and chose this present life
  79,39,shall have his home in Hell
  79,40,and he that feared to stand before his Lord
  79,41,and curbed his soul‘s desire shall have his home in Paradise
  79,42,They question you about the Hour. ‘When will it come?‘
  79,43,But how are you to know
  79,44,Only your Lord knows when the end will come
  79,45,Your duty is but to warn those that fear it
  79,46,"On the day they see it, it will seem as if they had lingered but one evening, or one morning"
