  2,225,God will not call you to account for that which is inadvertent in your oaths. But He will take you to task for that which is intended in your hearts. God is forgiving and lenient
  2,226,"Those that renounce their wives on oath must wait four months. If they change their minds, God is forgiving and compassionate"

  2,229,"Divorce¹ may be pronounced twice, and then a woman shall be retained in honour or allowed to go with kindness.

Such are the bounds of God. He makes them plain to those endowed with knowledge"
