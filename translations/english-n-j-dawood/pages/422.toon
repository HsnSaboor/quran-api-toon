  33,32,"Wives of the Prophet! You are not like other women. If you fear God, do not be too complaisant in your speech, lest the lecherous-hearted should lust after you. Show discretion in what you say"
  33,33,"Stay in your homes and do not display your finery as women used to do in the days of ignorance.² Attend to your prayers, give alms and obey God and His apostle. Women of the Household, God seeks only to remove abomination from you and to purify you"
  33,34,Commit to memory the revelations of God and the wise sayings that are recited in your dwellings. Gracious is God and all-knowing
  33,35,"Be they men or women, those who are Muslims and have Faith; who are devout, sincere, patient, humble, charitable, and chaste; who fast and are ever mindful of God ― on these God will bestow forgiveness and a rich recompense"
