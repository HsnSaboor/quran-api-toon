quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,135,"They say: ‘Follow the Jewish or the Christian faith and you shall be rightly guided.‘ Say: ‘By no means! Only the faith of Abraham, the upright one. And He was no idolater.‘"
  2,136,"Say: ‘We believe in God and that which has been revealed to us; in what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the tribes; to Moses and Jesus and the other prophets by their Lord. We make no distinction among any of them, and to Him we do submit as Muslims.‘"
  2,137,"If they believe as you believe, they shall be rightly guided; if they turn away, they shall surely be in schism. Against them God is your all-sufficient defender. And it is He that hears all and knows all"
  2,138,We take on God‘s own dye. And who has a better dye than God‘s? Him will we worship
  2,139,"Say: ‘Would you dispute with us about God, who is our Lord and your Lord? We shall both be judged by our works. To Him alone we are devoted"
  2,140,"Or do you claim that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the tribes, were all Jews or Christians?‘ Say: ‘Who knows better, you or God? Who is more wicked than he that hides a testimony he has received from God? God is never heedless of what you do.‘"
  2,141,That community has passed away. Theirs is what they did and yours what you have done. You shall not be questioned about their actions
