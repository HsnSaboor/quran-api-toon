quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,55,"So let neither their riches nor their children make you wonder. Through these God seeks to punish them in the life of this world, so that their souls shall perish while they are still in unbelief"
  9,56,"They swear by God that they are believers with you, and they are not with you. But they are afraid"
  9,57,"If they could find a shelter or some cave, or any hiding-place, they would run in frantic haste to seek refuge in it"
  9,58,"And there are some among them who speak ill of you¹ concerning the distribution of alms. If a share is given them, they are content: but if they are not given a share, they grow resentful"
  9,59,"Would that they were satisfied with what God and His apostle have given them, and said: ‘All-sufficient is God for us. God will provide for us from His own bounty, and so will His apostle. To God we will humbly submit.‘"
  9,60,"Alms shall be only for the poor and the destitute, for those that are engaged in the management of alms and those whose hearts are sympathetic to the Faith; for the freeing of slaves and debtors; for the advancement of God‘s cause; and for the traveller in need. That is a duty enjoined by God. God is all-knowing and wise"
  9,61,"And there are some among them who speak ill of the Prophet, saying: ‘He has an ear for everything.‘ Say: ‘He has an ear for only what is good for you. He believes in God and puts his trust in the faithful. He is a blessing to the true believers among you. Those that speak ill of God‘s apostle have woeful punishment in wait for them.‘"
