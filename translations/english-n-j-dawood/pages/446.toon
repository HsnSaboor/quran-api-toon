quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,1,BY THOSE who range themselves in ranks
  37,2,by those who cast out demons;¹
  37,3,and by those who recite an Admonition
  37,4,your God is One
  37,5,"the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them: the Lord of the Eastern Regions"
  37,6,We have decked the lower heaven with constellations
  37,7,guarding it against every rebellious demon
  37,8,so that they may not listen in to those on high. Meteors are hurled at them from every side
  37,9,"then, driven away, they are consigned to an eternal scourge"
  37,10,Eavesdroppers are pursued by fiery comets
  37,11,Ask them if they deem themselves of a nobler make than the rest of Our creation. Of coarse clay We created them
  37,12,"You marvel, while they scoff"
  37,13,When they are warned they heed no warning
  37,14,When they are shown a sign they mock at it
  37,15,"and say: ‘This is but sorcery manifest"
  37,16,"What! When we have died and turned to dust and bones, shall we be raised to life"
  37,17,we and our forefathers?‘
  37,18,"Say: ‘Yes. And you shall be utterly humbled.‘"
  37,19,"One blast will sound, and they shall see it all"
  37,20,Woe betide us!‘ they will say. ‘This is the Day of Reckoning
  37,21,this is the Judgement-day which you denied.‘
  37,22,"But We shall say: ‘Herd up the sinners, their spouses, and the deities they worshipped"
  37,23,"besides God, and lead them to the path of Hell"
  37,24,Hold them there for questioning
