quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,that this is a holy Koran
  56,78,safeguarded in a Book
  56,79,which none may touch except the purified
  56,80,a revelation sent down from the Lord of the Universe
  56,81,Would you scorn a Scripture such as this
  56,82,and earn your daily bread denying it
  56,83,When under your very eyes a dying man‘s soul leaps up to his throat
  56,84,And you are at that time looking on
  56,85,"We are nearer to him than you, although you cannot see"
  56,86,"why do you not restore it, if you are not to be judged hereafter"
  56,87,If what you say be true
  56,88,"Thus, if he is favoured"
  56,89,"his lot will be repose and plenty, and a Garden of Delight"
  56,90,If he is one of those on the right hand
  56,91,"he will be greeted with, ‘Peace be with you!‘ by those on the right hand"
  56,92,But if he is an erring disbeliever
  56,93,his welcome shall be a downpour of scalding water
  56,94,and incineration in a hell
  56,95,This is surely the veritable Truth
  56,96,"Praise, then, the name of your Lord, the Supreme One"
  57,1,"ALL THAT is in the heavens and on the earth gives glory to God. He is the Almighty, the Wise One"
  57,2,"He it is that has sovereignty over the heavens and the earth. He ordains life and death, and has power over all things"
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last, the Visible and the Unseen. He has knowledge of all things"
