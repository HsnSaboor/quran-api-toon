quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  71,11,He sends down abundant water from the sky for you and bestows upon you wealth and children
  71,12,He has provided you with gardens and with running brooks
  71,13,Why do you deny the greatness of God
  71,14,when He created you in gradual stages
  71,15,Can you not see how God created the seven heavens one above the other
  71,16,placing in them the moon for a light and the sun for a lantern
  71,17,God has brought you forth from the earth like a plant
  71,18,and to the earth He will restore you. Then He will bring you back from it afresh
  71,19,And God has made the earth a vast expanse for you
  71,20,"that you may roam its spacious paths.\"‘"
  71,21,"And Noah said: ‘Lord, they disobey me, and follow those whose wealth and offspring will only hasten their perdition"
  71,22,They have devised an outrageous plot
  71,23,"and said to each other: \"Do not renounce your gods. Do not forsake Wadd or Suwā‘ or Yaghūth or Ya‘ūq or Nasr.\"¹"
  71,24,They have led many astray; and You surely drive the wrongdoers to further error.‘
  71,25,Because of their sins they were drowned and cast into the Fire. They found none besides God to help them
  71,26,"And Noah said: ‘Lord, do not leave a single unbeliever on the earth"
  71,27,"If You spare them, they will mislead Your servants and beget none but sinners and unbelievers"
  71,28,"Forgive me, Lord, and forgive my parents and whoever enters my house a true believer. ‘Forgive all the faithful, men and women, and hasten the wrongdoers‘ destruction.‘"
