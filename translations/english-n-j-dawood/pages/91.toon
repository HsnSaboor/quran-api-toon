quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,80,"He that obeys the Apostle has assuredly obeyed God. As for those that pay no heed, We have not sent you to be their keeper"
  4,81,"They promise obedience: but as soon as they leave your presence a band of them plot in secret to do otherwise. God takes note of all their plots. Therefore let them be, and put your trust in God. Sufficient is God as a guardian"
  4,82,"Will they not ponder on the Koran? If it had come from other than God, they could have surely found in it many contradictions"
  4,83,"When they hear any news, good or bad, they at once make it known to all; whereas if they reported it to the Apostle and to those in authority among them, those who sought news could learn it from them. But for God‘s grace and mercy, all but a few of you would have followed Satan"
  4,84,"Therefore fight for the cause of God. You are accountable for none but yourself. Rouse the faithful: perchance God will overthrow the might of the unbelievers. Mightier is God and more terrible is His retribution"
  4,85,He that mediates in a good cause shall gain by his mediation; and he that mediates in a bad cause shall be held accountable for its evil. God surely has control over all things
  4,86,"If a man greets you, let your greeting be better than his ― or at least return it. God surely keeps count of all things"
