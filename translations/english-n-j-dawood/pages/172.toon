quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  7,164,"And when one of their tribe said: ‘Why do you admonish a people for whom God has ordained destruction and grievous torment?‘ they replied: ‘To be blameless in the sight of your Lord, and that they may fear God.‘"
  7,165,"Therefore, when they forgot the warning they were given, We delivered those who had admonished against evil, and smote the wrongdoers with punishment for their misdeeds"
  7,166,"And when they scornfully persisted in their forbidden ways, We said to them: ‘Turn into detested apes.‘"
  7,167,"Then your Lord declared that He would raise against them others who would oppress them grievously till the Day of Resurrection. Swift is the retribution of your Lord, yet is He forgiving and compassionate"
  7,168,"We dispersed them into communities throughout the earth ― some were righteous, others were not ― and tested them with blessings and misfortunes so that they might return to the right path"
  7,169,"Then others succeeded them who inherited the Book and took to these nether vanities. ‘We shall be forgiven,‘ they said. And if such vanities came their way once more, they would again take to them. Are they not committed in the Book to tell nothing of God but what is true? And they have studied it well; surely the world to come is better for those that fear God. Have you no sense"
  7,170,"As for those that strictly observe the Book and are steadfast in prayer, We shall not deny the righteous their reward"
