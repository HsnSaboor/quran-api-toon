quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,Some of us are Muslims and some are wrongdoers. Those that embrace Islām pursue the right path
  72,15,"but those that do wrong shall become the fuel of Hell.\"‘"
  72,16,If they¹ pursue the straight path We shall vouchsafe them abundant rain
  72,17,and thereby put them to the proof. He that pays no heed to his Lord‘s Admonition shall be thrust into a grievous torment
  72,18,Mosques are for God‘s worship; invoke in them no other deity besides Him
  72,19,"When God‘s servant² rose to pray to Him, they pressed around him in multitudes"
  72,20,"Say: ‘I will pray to my Lord and worship none besides Him.‘"
  72,21,"Say: ‘I have no control over any evil or good that befalls you"
  72,22,"Say: ‘None can protect me from God, nor can I find any refuge besides Him"
  72,23,My mission is only to communicate God‘s messages; those that disobey God and His apostle shall for ever abide in the fire of Hell.‘
  72,24,"When they behold the scourge they are promised, they shall realize who had the less powerful protector, and who were fewer in number"
  72,25,"Say: ‘I cannot tell whether the scourge you are promised is imminent, or whether my Lord has set for it a far-off day"
  72,26,"Cognizant of the unseen, His secrets He reveals to none"
  72,27,except to the apostles He has chosen
  72,28,"He sends down guardians who walk before them and behind them, that He may ascertain if they have indeed delivered their Lord‘s messages. He has knowledge of all they have, and keeps strict count of all things.‘"
