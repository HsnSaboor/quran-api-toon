quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,15,"When Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who entertain no hope of meeting Us say to you: ‘Give us a Koran different from this, or change it.‘ Say: ‘It is not for me to change it of my own accord. I follow only what is revealed to me, for I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the punishment of a fateful day.‘"
  10,16,"Say: ‘Had God pleased, I would never have recited it to you, nor would He have made you aware of it. A whole lifetime I dwelt among you before its coming. Will you not understand?‘"
  10,17,"Who is more wicked than he who invents a falsehood about God or denies His revelations? Truly, the transgressors shall not succeed"
  10,18,"They worship idols that can neither harm nor help them, and say: ‘These will intercede for us with God.‘ Say: ‘Do you presume to tell God of what He knows to exist neither in the heavens nor on earth?‘ Glory be to Him! Exalted be He above the gods they serve besides Him"
  10,19,"There was a time when mankind were but one community. Then they disagreed among themselves: and but for a Word from your Lord, long since decreed, their differences would have been surely resolved"
  10,20,"And they say: ‘Why has no sign been sent down to him from his Lord?‘ Say: ‘God alone has knowledge of what is hidden. Wait if you will: I will wait with you.‘"
