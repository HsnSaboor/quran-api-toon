  59,15,"Like those who were but recently punished before them, they tasted the fruit of their own deeds. And woeful punishment awaits them"
  59,16,"They may be compared to Satan, who, when he ordered man to disbelieve and he did his bidding, said to him: ‘I do disown you. I fear God, Lord of the Universe.‘"
