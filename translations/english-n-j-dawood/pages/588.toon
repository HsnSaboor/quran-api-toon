quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,No! The record of the sinners is in Sijjīn
  83,8,Would that you knew what Sijjīn is
  83,9,It is a sealed book
  83,10,On that day woe betide the disbelievers
  83,11,who deny the Last Judgement
  83,12,None denies it except the sinful transgressor
  83,13,"who, when Our revelations are recited to him, says: ‘Fables of the ancients!‘"
  83,14,No! But their own deeds have drawn a veil over their hearts
  83,15,No! On a screen shall on that day be set between them and their Lord
  83,16,Then shall they burn in Hell
  83,17,"and shall be told: ‘This is what you denied!‘"
  83,18,No! But the record of the righteous shall be in ‘Illiyyūn
  83,19,Would that you knew what ‘Illiyyūn is
  83,20,It is a sealed book
  83,21,seen only by the favoured ones
  83,22,The righteous will surely be in bliss
  83,23,Reclining upon soft couches they will gaze around
  83,24,and in their faces you shall mark the glow of joy
  83,25,They shall be served with pure nectar to drink
  83,26,"securely sealed, whose very dregs are musk: for this let all contenders emulously strive"
  83,27,tempered with the waters of Tasnīm
  83,28,a spring at which the favoured will refresh themselves
  83,29,Those who transgress laugh at the faithful
  83,30,and wink at one another as they pass by them
  83,31,When they meet their own kin they speak of them with jests
  83,32,"and when they see them say: ‘These have surely lost their way.‘"
  83,33,Yet they were not sent to be their keepers
  83,34,But on that day the faithful will at the infidels laugh
