quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,135,"Believers, conduct yourselves with justice and bear true witness before God, even though it be against yourselves, your parents, or your kin. Be they rich or poor, God knows better about them both. So do not be led by passion, lest you swerve from the truth. If you distort your testimony or decline to give it, know that God is cognizant of all your actions"
  4,136,"Believers, have faith in God and His apostle, in the Book He has revealed to His apostle, and in the Scriptures He formerly revealed. He that denies God, His angels, His Scriptures, His apostles, and the Last Day has strayed far indeed"
  4,137,"Those who accept the Faith and then renounce it, who again embrace it and again deny it and grow in unbelief ― God will neither forgive them nor rightly guide them"
  4,138,Give warning to the hypocrites that woeful punishment awaits them
  4,139,those who choose the unbelievers rather than the faithful for their friends. Are they seeking glory at their hands? Surely all glory belongs to God
  4,140,He has instructed you in the Book that if you hear God‘s revelations being blasphemed or ridiculed you shall not sit with them until they engage in other talk; or else you shall yourselves become like them. God will surely gather in Hell the hypocrites and the unbelievers all
