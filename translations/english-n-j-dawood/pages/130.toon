quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Say: ‘What counts most in testimony?‘ Say: ‘God is my witness and your witness. This Koran has been revealed to me that I may thereby warn you and all whom it may reach. Will you really testify there are other gods besides God?‘ Say: ‘I will testify to no such thing!‘ Say: ‘He is but one God. I disown the gods you serve besides Him.‘"

  6,25,"And some among them listen to you. But We have cast veils over their hearts and made them hard of hearing lest they understand your words.

  6,26,"They forbid it and distance themselves from it. They ruin none but themselves, though they do not perceive it"
  6,27,"If you could see them when they are set before the Fire! They will say: ‘Would that we could return! Then we would not deny the revelations of our Lord and would be true believers.‘"
