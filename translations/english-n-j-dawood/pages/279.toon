quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,103,"We do know that they say: ‘A mortal taught him.‘ But the man² to whom they allude speaks a foreign tongue, while this is eloquent Arabic speech"
  16,104,Those who disbelieve God‘s revelations God will not guide. Woeful punishment awaits them
  16,105,"None invents falsehoods save those who disbelieve God‘s revelations: it is they that are the liars"
  16,106,Those who are forced to recant while their hearts remain loyal to the Faith shall be absolved; but those who open their bosoms to unbelief shall incur God‘s ire; and grievous punishment awaits them
  16,107,That is because they love the life of this world more than the life to come; and God does not guide the unbelievers
  16,108,Such are those whose hearts and ears and eyes are sealed by God; such are the heedless
  16,109,In the life to come they will assuredly be lost
  16,110,Your Lord ― to those who after persecution fled their land and fought and remained constant to the last ― your Lord will be forgiving and compassionate
