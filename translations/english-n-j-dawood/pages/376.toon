quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,of what avail will their past enjoyments be to them
  26,208,Never have We destroyed a city We did not warn
  26,209,and admonish beforehand. We are never unjust
  26,210,It was not the demons who brought this down
  26,211,it is neither in their interest nor in their power
  26,212,"Indeed, they are too far away to overhear it"
  26,213,"Therefore call on no other god besides God, lest you suffer torment"
  26,214,Admonish your nearest kin
  26,215,and show kindness to those of the believers who follow you
  26,216,"If they disobey you, say: ‘I am not accountable for what you do.‘"
  26,217,"Put your trust in the Mighty One, the Compassionate"
  26,218,who observes you when you stand upright
  26,219,and when you walk among the worshippers
  26,220,He it is who hears all and knows all
  26,221,Shall I tell you on whom the demons descend
  26,222,They descend on every lying sinner
  26,223,"They eagerly listen, but most of them are liars"
  26,224,Poets are followed by erring men
  26,225,Behold how aimlessly they rove in every valley
  26,226,preaching what they never practise
  26,227,"Not so the true believers, who do good works and remember God with fervour and defend themselves only when wronged. The wrongdoers will then learn to what end they will be overturned"
