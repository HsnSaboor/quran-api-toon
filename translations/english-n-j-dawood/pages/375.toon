quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,184,And fear Him who created you and the earlier generation.‘
  26,185,"They said: ‘You are surely bewitched"
  26,186,"You are but a mortal like ourselves. Indeed, we believe that you are lying"
  26,187,Bring down upon us a fragment of the sky if what you say be true.‘
  26,188,"He said: ‘My Lord has better knowledge of what you do.‘"
  26,189,"They disbelieved him, and thus the scourge of the Day of Darkness smote them; it was surely the scourge of a fateful day"
  26,190,Surely in that there was a sign; yet most of them did not believe
  26,191,"Your Lord is the Mighty One, the Compassionate"
  26,192,This is surely revealed by the Lord of the Universe
  26,193,The Faithful Spirit has brought it down
  26,194,"into your heart, that you may give warning"
  26,195,in eloquent Arabic speech
  26,196,It was surely foretold in the Scriptures of the ancients
  26,197,Is it not sufficient proof for them that the doctors of the Israelites recognize it
  26,198,If We had revealed it to a foreign man
  26,199,"and he had recited it to them, they still would not have believed"
  26,200,Thus do We put unbelief in the hearts of the guilty
  26,201,they shall not believe in it until they see the woeful scourge
  26,202,which shall suddenly smite them when they are heedless
  26,203,"And then they will say: ‘Shall we ever be reprieved?‘"
  26,204,Is it their wish to hurry on Our scourge
  26,205,Think! If We let them live in ease for many years
  26,206,and then the promised scourge does fall upon them
