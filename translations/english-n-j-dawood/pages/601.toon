quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,I SWEAR by the declining day
  103,2,that perdition shall be the lot of Man
  103,3,except for those who believe and do good works; who exhort each other to justice and to fortitude
  104,1,WOE BETIDE every back-biting slanderer
  104,2,who amasses riches and sedulously hoards them
  104,3,thinking his wealth will render him immortal
  104,4,By no means! He shall be flung into the Destroying Flame
  104,5,Would that you knew what the Destroying Flame is like
  104,6,It is God‘s own kindled fire
  104,7,which will rise up to the hearts
  104,8,It will close in upon them
  104,9,in towering columns
  105,1,HAVE YOU not considered how your Lord dealt with the Army of the Elephant?¹
  105,2,Did He not confound their stratagem
  105,3,and send against them flocks of birds
  105,4,which pelted them with clay-stones
  105,5,so that they became like the withered stalks of plants which cattle had devoured
