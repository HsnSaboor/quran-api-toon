quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,62,"They swear by God in order to please you. But it is more just that they should please God and the Apostle, if they are true believers"
  9,63,Are they not aware that whoever defies God and His apostle shall abide for ever in the fire of Hell? That surely is the supreme humiliation
  9,64,"The hypocrites are afraid lest a sūrahbe revealed to them, telling them what is in their hearts. Say: ‘Scoff if you will; God will surely bring to light what you are dreading.‘"
  9,65,"If you question them, they will surely say: ‘We were only jesting and making merry.‘ Say: ‘Would you mock God, His revelations, and His apostle"
  9,66,"Make no excuses. You have renounced the Faith after embracing it. If We pardon some among you, We will punish others, for they were transgressors.‘"
  9,67,"Be they men or women, the hypocrites are all alike. They enjoin the reprehensible, forbid the just, and tighten their fists. They forgot God, so God forgot them. Surely it is the hypocrites who are the ungodly"
  9,68,"God has promised the hypocrites, both men and women, and the unbelievers, the fire of Hell. Therein shall they abide for ever: a sufficient recompense. God has cursed them; and lasting torment awaits them"
