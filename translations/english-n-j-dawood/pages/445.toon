quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  36,71,"Or have they not considered how, among the things Our hands have made, We have created for them the beasts of which they are masters"
  36,72,"We have subjected these to them, that they may ride on some and eat the flesh of others"
  36,73,they drink their milk and put them to other uses. Will they not give thanks
  36,74,"They have set up other gods besides God, hoping they may be helped"
  36,75,"They cannot help them: yet they stand like warriors ready to defend their idols"
  36,76,So let not their words grieve you. We have knowledge of what they conceal and what they reveal
  36,77,Has not man considered that We created him from a little germ? Yet is he brazenly contentious
  36,78,"He answers Us back with arguments, and forgets his own creation. He says: ‘Who will give life to rotten bones?‘"
  36,79,"Say: ‘He who first brought them into being will give them life again: He has knowledge of every creature"
  36,80,"He who gives you from the green tree a flame, and lo! you light a fire.‘"
  36,81,Or has He who created the heavens and the earth no power to create others like them? That He surely has. He is the all-knowing Creator
  36,82,"When He decrees a thing He need only say: ‘Be,‘ and it is"
  36,83,So glory be to Him who with His hands holds sovereignty over all things and to whome shall you be recalled
