quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"They are like one who kindled a fire, but as soon as it lit up all around him God put it out and left him in darkness: they do not see"
  2,18,"Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will never return to the right path"
  2,19,"Or like those who, beneath a dark storm-cloud charged with thunder and lightning, thrust their fingers into their ears at the sound of every thunder-clap for fear of death (God thus encompasses the unbelievers)"
  2,20,"The lightning almost snatches away their sight: whenever it flashes upon them they walk on, but as soon as it darkens they stand still. Indeed, if God pleased, He could take away their hearing and their sight: God has power over all things"
  2,21,"You people! Worship your Lord, who has created you and those who have gone before you, so that you may guard yourselves against evil"
  2,22,"who has made the earth a bed for you and the sky a dome, and has sent down water from the sky to bring forth fruits for your sustenance. Do not knowingly set up other deities beside God"
  2,23,"And if you doubt what We have revealed to Our servant, produce one sūrah comparable to it. Call upon your idols to assist you, if what you say be true"
  2,24,"But if you fail (as you are sure to fail), then guard yourselves against the Fire whose fuel is humans and stones, prepared for the unbelievers"
