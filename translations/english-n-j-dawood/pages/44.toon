quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,260,"And when Abraham said: ‘Show me, Lord, how You will raise the dead,‘ He replied: ‘Have you no faith?‘ ‘Yes,‘ said he, ‘but just to reassure my heart.‘ He said: ‘Take four birds, and cut them to pieces. Scatter them over the mountain-tops, then call them back. They will come swiftly to you. Know that God is mighty and wise.‘"
  2,261,"Those that give their wealth for the cause of God can be compared to a grain of corn which brings forth seven ears, each bearing a hundred grains. God gives more and more to whom He will; God is munificent and all-knowing"
  2,262,Those that give their wealth for the cause of God and do not follow their almsgiving with taunts and insults shall be rewarded by their Lord; they shall have nothing to fear or to regret
  2,263,A kind word with forgiveness is better than charity followed by insult. God is self-sufficient and gracious
  2,264,"Believers, do not nullify your almsgiving with taunts and mischief-making, like him who spends his wealth only to be seen by people, and believes neither in God nor in the Last Day. He can be compared to a rock covered with earth: a shower falls upon it and leaves it hard and bare. They shall gain nothing from their works; and God does not guide the unbelievers"
