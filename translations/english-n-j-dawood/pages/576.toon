quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,"He pondered, and he schemed"
  74,19,"Confound him, how he schemed"
  74,20,"Again, confound him, how he schemed"
  74,21,He looked around him
  74,22,frowning and scowling
  74,23,then he turned away in scornful pride
  74,24,"and said: ‘This is but sorcery counterfeited"
  74,25,this is but the utterance of a mortal!‘
  74,26,I will surely cast him into the Fire
  74,27,Would that you knew what the Fire is like
  74,28,"It leaves nothing, it spares no one"
  74,29,it burns the skins of mortals
  74,30,It is guarded by nineteen keepers
  74,31,"We have appointed none but angels to guard the Fire, and made their number a subject for dispute among the unbelievers, so that those to whom the Book were given may be convinced and the true believers strengthened in their faith; that those to whom the Book were given, and the true believers, may have no doubts; and that those whose hearts are tainted and unbelievers may say: ‘What could God mean by this as an example?‘ Thus God confounds whom He will and guides whom He pleases. None knows the warriors of your Lord but Himself. This is no more than an Admonition to mankind"
  74,32,"No, by the moon"
  74,33,By the departing night
  74,34,and the coming dawn
  74,35,it is a dire scourge
  74,36,a warning to mankind
  74,37,alike to those of you that would march on and those that would remain behind
  74,38,Each soul is the hostage of its own deeds
  74,39,Those on the right hand
  74,40,will in Gardens
  74,41,ask the sinners
  74,42,What has brought you into Hell?‘
  74,43,"They will say: We were never of those who prayed"
  74,44,nor did we ever feed the destitute
  74,45,We engaged in vain discourse with those who engaged in it
  74,46,and denied the Day of Reckoning
  74,47,till the Inevitable claimed us.‘
