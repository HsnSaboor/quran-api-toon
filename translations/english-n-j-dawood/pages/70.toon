quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  3,154,"Then, after tribulation, He let peace fall upon you ― a sleep which overtook some among you, while others lay troubled by their own fancies, thinking unjust and foolish thoughts about God. ‘Have we any say in the matter?‘ they ask. Say: ‘All is in the hands of God.‘ They conceal in their minds what they do not reveal to you. They complain: ‘Had we had any say in the matter, we should not have been slain here.‘ Say: ‘Had you stayed in your homes, those of you who were destined to be slain would have died in their beds; for it was God‘s will to test what was in your bosoms and to scrutinize what was in your hearts. God has full knowledge of one‘s innermost thoughts.‘"
  3,155,Those of you who ran away on the day the two armies met¹ must have been seduced by Satan on account of some evil they had done. But now God has pardoned them; God is forgiving and lenient
  3,156,"Believers, do not follow the example of the infidels, who say of their brothers when they meet death abroad or in battle: ‘Had they stayed with us they would not have died, nor would they have been killed.‘ God will turn that into a sigh in their hearts. God has power over life and death, and God is ever observant of what you do"
  3,157,"If you should be slain in the cause of God or die, God‘s forgiveness and His mercy would surely be better than the riches they amass"
