quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"He alone has knowledge of the Hour. No fruit comes out of their pods, no female conceives or is delivered, but with His knowledge. On the day He will call out to them: ‘Where are those fellow-gods of Mine?‘ ‘We confess,‘ they will say, ‘that none of us can vouch for them.‘"
  41,48,"The idols to which they prayed before will vanish from them, and they shall learn there is no escape"
  41,49,Man never wearies of praying for good things. But when evil befalls him he loses hope and grows despondent
  41,50,"And if after affliction We vouchsafe him a favour from Ourself, he is sure to say: ‘This is my own. I do not think the Hour will ever come. And even if I do return to my Lord, He will surely reward me well.‘ We shall tell the unbelievers what they did, and We will surely visit upon them a grievous scourge"
  41,51,"When We show favour to man, he turns his back and holds aloof; but when evil befalls him he is loud in prayer"
  41,52,"Say: ‘Do but consider: if this Koran is indeed from God and you deny it, who can err more than he who openly defies Him?‘"
  41,53,"We will show them Our signs across the horizons and in their own souls, until they clearly see that it is the Truth. Does it not suffice that your Lord is the witness of all things"
  41,54,Yet they still doubt that they will ever meet their Lord. Yet surely He encompasses all things
