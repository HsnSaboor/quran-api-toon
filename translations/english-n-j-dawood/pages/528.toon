quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,"that God created the two sexes, the male and the female"
  53,46,from a drop of ejaculated semen
  53,47,and will bring about the other creation
  53,48,that it is He who bestows and enriches
  53,49,He who is the Lord of Sirius;¹
  53,50,that it was He who obliterated ‘Ād at first
  53,51,"and then Thamūd, sparing no one"
  53,52,"and before them the people of Noah, who were more sinful and more rebellious"
  53,53,The Mu‘tafikah² He also doomed
  53,54,so that they were smitten by the scourge that smote them
  53,55,Which then of your Lord‘s blessings would you deny
  53,56,He that now warns you is just like those who warned the others before you
  53,57,That which is coming is near at hand
  53,58,none but God can disclose the Hour
  53,59,Do you marvel then at this revelation
  53,60,and laugh instead of weeping
  53,61,Making merry still
  53,62,"Rather prostrate yourselves before God, and worship"
  54,1,"THE HOUR is drawing near, and the moon is cleft in two"
  54,2,"Yet, when they behold a sign, the unbelievers turn their backs and say: ‘Sorcery unceasing!‘"
  54,3,"They deny the truth, and follow their own fancies. But in the end all issues shall be laid to rest"
  54,4,"Cautionary tales, profound in wisdom, have been narrated to them"
  54,5,but warnings are unavailing
  54,6,Let them be. The day the Crier summons them to the dread account
