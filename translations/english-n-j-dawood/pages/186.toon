quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  8,70,"Prophet, say to those you have taken captive: ‘If God finds goodness in your hearts, He will give you that which is better than what was taken from you, and He will forgive you. God is forgiving and compassionate.‘"
  8,71,"But if they seek to betray you, they have already betrayed God. Therefore He has made you triumph over them; God is all-knowing and wise"
  8,72,"Those that have embraced the Faith and left their land, and fought for the cause of God with their wealth and with their persons; and those that sheltered and helped, shall be as friends to each other. Those that have embraced the Faith, but have not left, shall in no way be your friends until they leave. But if they seek your help in the cause of the Religion, it is your duty to assist them, except against a people with whom you have a treaty. And God is ever observant of what you do"
  8,73,"The unbelievers give aid and comfort to each other. If you fail to do likewise, there will be sedition in the land and great corruption"
  8,74,"Those that have embraced the Faith and fled their land and fought for the cause of God, and those that sheltered and helped ― they are the true believers. Forgiveness and a gracious provision await them"
  8,75,Those that have since embraced the Faith and left their land and fought with you ― they too are your brothers; although according to the Book of God those who are bound by ties of blood are nearest to one another. Surely God has knowledge of all things
