quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"Say: ‘I have not the power to acquire benefits or to avert evil from myself; except by the will of God. Had I possessed knowledge of what is hidden, I would have availed myself of much that is good and no harm would have touched me. But I am no more than one who gives warning and joyful tidings to true believers.‘"
  7,189,"He it was who created you from a single being.³ From that being He created his spouse, so that he might find comfort in her.

She carried it with ease, but when it grew heavy, they both cried to God their Lord: ‘Grant us a goodly child and we will be truly thankful.‘"
  7,190,"Yet when He had granted them a goodly child, they both set up other gods besides Him in return for what He gave them. Exalted be God above their idols"

  7,194,"Those whom you invoke besides God are, like yourselves, His creatures. Call on them, and let them answer you, if what you say be true"
  7,195,"Have they feet to walk with? Or have they hands to hold with? Or have they eyes to see with? Or have they ears to hear with? Say: ‘Call on your false gods and scheme against me. Give me no respite"
