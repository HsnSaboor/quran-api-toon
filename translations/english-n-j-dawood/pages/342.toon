quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,SUCCESSFUL ARE the believers
  23,2,who are humble in their prayers
  23,3,who avoid profane talk
  23,4,and give alms in earnest
  23,5,who restrain their carnal desires
  23,6,"except with their wives and slave-girls, for with them they are blameless"
  23,7,transgressors are those who lust after other than these
  23,8,who are true to their trusts and promises
  23,9,and diligent in their prayers
  23,10,These are the heirs
  23,11,of Paradise; wherein shall they abide for ever
  23,12,We first created man from an essence of clay
  23,13,"then placed him, a living germ, in a secure enclosure¹"
  23,14,"The germ We made a clot of blood,² and the clot a lump of flesh. This We fashioned into bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, thus bringing forth another creation. Blessed be God, the noblest of creators"
  23,15,Then you shall surely die hereafter
  23,16,and then be restored to life on the Day of Resurrection
  23,17,We have created seven heavens³ above you; of Our creation We were never heedless
