quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,No! But you² love this fleeting life
  75,21,and ignore the life to come
  75,22,On that day there shall be joyous faces
  75,23,looking towards their Lord
  75,24,On that day there shall be mournful faces
  75,25,dreading some great affliction
  75,26,No! But when a man‘s soul is about to leave him
  75,27,"and those around him say: ‘Will no one save him?‘"
  75,28,When he knows it is the final parting
  75,29,and leg and leg are twined ―
  75,30,on that day to your Lord he shall be driven
  75,31,For in this life he neither believed nor prayed
  75,32,"he denied the Truth and, turning his back"
  75,33,went to his kin elated with pride
  75,34,Well have you deserved this doom; well have you deserved it
  75,35,"Well have you deserved this doom: too well have you deserved it"
  75,36,"Does man think he will be left alone, to no purpose"
  75,37,Was he not a drop of ejaculated semen
  75,38,He became a clot of blood;³ then God formed and moulded him
  75,39,and gave him male and female parts
  75,40,"Has He no power, then, to raise the dead to life"
  76,1,DOES THERE not pass over man a space of time when his life is a blank?⁴
  76,2,"We have created man from the union of the two sexes, that We may put him to the proof. We have endowed him with hearing and sight"
  76,3,"and, be he thankful or oblivious of Our favours, We have shown him the right path"
  76,4,"For the unbelievers We have prepared chains and fetters, and a Conflagration"
  76,5,But the righteous shall drink of a cup tempered at the Camphor Fountain
