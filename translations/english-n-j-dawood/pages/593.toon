quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,BY THE Dawn
  89,2,and the Ten Nights¹
  89,3,"by that which is dual, and that which is single"
  89,4,"by the night, as it journeys on"
  89,5,Is there not in this a mighty oath for a man of sense
  89,6,Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with ‘Ād
  89,7,The many-columned city of Iram
  89,8,whose like has never been created in the land
  89,9,"And Thamūd, who hewed out their dwellings among the rocks of the valley"
  89,10,"And Pharaoh, who impaled his victims upon the stake"
  89,11,They had all led sinful lives
  89,12,and made the land teem with wickedness
  89,13,Therefore your Lord let loose on them the scourge of a torment
  89,14,for from His eminence your Lord observes all
  89,15,"As for man, when his Lord tests him by honouring him and bestowing blessings on him, he says: ‘My Lord has honoured me.‘"
  89,16,"But when He tests him by diminishing his provisions, he says: ‘My Lord despises me.‘"
  89,17,No! But you show no kindness to the orphan
  89,18,nor do you vie with each other in feeding the destitute
  89,19,Greedily you lay your hands on the inheritance of the weak
  89,20,and you love riches with all your hearts
  89,21,No! But when the earth is crushed to fine dust
  89,22,"and your Lord comes down with the angels, in their ranks"
  89,23,and Hell is on that day brought near ― on that day man will remember. And what will remembrance avail him
