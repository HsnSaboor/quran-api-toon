quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  18,98,"He said: \"This is a blessing from my Lord. But when my Lord‘s promise has been fulfilled, He will level it to dust, the promise of my Lord is ever true.\"‘"
  18,99,And on that day We will let them come in tumultuous throngs. The Trumpet shall be blown and We will gather them all together
  18,100,On that day We shall lay Hell bare before the unbelievers
  18,101,who have turned a blind eye to My Admonition and a deaf ear to My warning
  18,102,Do the unbelievers think that they can make My servants patrons besides Me? We have prepared Hell for the unbelievers to dwell in
  18,103,"Say: ‘Shall we tell you who will lose most through their labours"
  18,104,Those whose endeavours in this world are misguided and who yet think that what they do is right
  18,105,who disbelieve the revelations of their Lord and deny that they will ever meet Him.‘ Vain are the works of these. On the Day of Resurrection We shall give them no consequence
  18,106,"Hell is their reward: because they disbelieved, and because they mocked My apostles and My revelations"
  18,107,As for those that have faith and do good works
  18,108,"they shall forever dwell in the Gardens of Paradise, desiring no change"
  18,109,"Say: ‘If the sea were ink with which to write the words of my Lord, the sea would surely run dry before the words of my Lord were finished, though we found another sea to replenish it.‘"
  18,110,"Say: ‘I am but a mortal like yourselves. It is revealed to me that your God is one God. Let him that hopes to meet his Lord do what is right and worship none besides his Lord.‘"
