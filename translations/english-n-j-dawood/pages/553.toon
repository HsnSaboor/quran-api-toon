quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  62,1,"ALL THAT is in the heavens and on the earth gives glory to God, the Sovereign Lord, the Holy One, the Almighty, the Wise One"
  62,2,"He it is that has sent forth among the Gentiles an apostle of their own to recite to them His revelations, to purify them, and to instruct them in the Book and in wisdom, though they have hitherto been in evident error"
  62,3,"together with others of their own kin who have not yet followed them. He is the Almighty, the Wise One"
  62,4,"Such is the grace of God: He bestows it on whom He will. His grace is infinite"
  62,5,Those to whom the burden of the Torah was entrusted and yet refused to bear it are like a donkey laden with books. Wretched is the example of those who deny God‘s revelations; and God does not guide the wrongdoers
  62,6,"Say: ‘You that follow the Jewish Faith, if you claim that of all people you alone are God‘s friends, then you should wish for death, if what you say be true!‘"
  62,7,"But, because of what their hands have done, they will never wish for death; God knows the wrong-doers"
  62,8,"Say: ‘The death from which you flee is sure to overtake you. Then shall you be sent back to Him who knows the unknown and the manifest, and He will declare to you what you have done.‘"
