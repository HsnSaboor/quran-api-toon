quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Did We not create you from a humble fluid
  77,21,which We kept in a safe receptacle¹
  77,22,for an appointed term
  77,23,All this We did; how excellent is Our work
  77,24,On that day woe betide the disbelievers
  77,25,Have We not made the earth an abode
  77,26,for the living and for the dead
  77,27,"Have We not placed lofty mountains upon it, and given you fresh water for your drink"
  77,28,On that day woe betide the disbelievers
  77,29,Begone to that which you deny
  77,30,Depart into the shadow that will rise high in three columns
  77,31,giving neither shade nor shelter from the flames
  77,32,and throwing up sparks as huge as towers
  77,33,as bright as yellow camels
  77,34,On that day woe betide the disbelievers
  77,35,On that day they shall not speak
  77,36,nor shall their pleas be heeded
  77,37,On that day woe betide the disbelievers
  77,38,"Such is the Day of Judgement. We will herd you all, together with past generations"
  77,39,"If then you are cunning, try your spite against Me"
  77,40,On that day woe betide the disbelievers
  77,41,The righteous shall dwell amidst cool shades and fountains
  77,42,and feed on such fruits as they desire
  77,43,"Eat and drink, and may every joy attend you"
  77,44,This is the guerdon of your labours.‘ Thus shall We recompense the righteous
  77,45,On that day woe betide the disbelievers
  77,46,Eat and enjoy yourselves awhile. Surely you are sinners all
  77,47,On that day woe betide the disbelievers
  77,48,"If they are bidden to kneel down, they do not kneel"
  77,49,On that day woe betide the disbelievers
  77,50,"In what revelation, after this, will they believe"
