quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,73,"Prophet, make war on the unbelievers and the hypocrites and deal rigorously with them. Hell shall be their home: a wretched fate"
  9,74,"They swear by God that they said nothing. Yet they uttered the word of blasphemy and renounced Islām after embracing it. They sought to do what they could not attain. Yet they had no reason to be spiteful; except perhaps because God and His apostle had enriched them through His bounty. If they repent, it will indeed be better for them; but if they pay no heed, God will torment them grievously, in this world and in the world to come. They shall have none on earth to protect or succour them"
  9,75,"Some among them pledged themselves to God: ‘If He is bountiful to us, we will assuredly give alms and be among the righteous.‘"

  9,77,"He has caused hypocrisy to reign in their hearts till the day they meet Him, because they have been untrue to the pledge they gave Him and because of the lies they told"

  9,79,"As for those that taunt the believers who give freely, and deride those who give according to their means, God will deride them. Woeful punishment awaits them"
