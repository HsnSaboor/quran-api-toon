quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,WHEN THE sun ceases to shine
  81,2,when the stars fall
  81,3,and the mountains are blown away
  81,4,when camels big with young are left untended
  81,5,and the wild beasts are together herded
  81,6,when the seas are set ablaze
  81,7,and souls are reunited
  81,8,"when the infant girl,¹ buried alive, is asked"
  81,9,for what crime she was slain
  81,10,when the records of men‘s deeds are laid open
  81,11,and heaven is stripped bare
  81,12,when Hell turns into a Conflagration
  81,13,and Paradise is brought near
  81,14,then each soul shall learn what it has done
  81,15,I swear by the turning planets
  81,16,and by the stars that rise and set
  81,17,"by the night, when it darkens"
  81,18,and the first breath of morning
  81,19,this is the Word of a messenger gracious and mighty
  81,20,held in honour by the Lord of the Throne
  81,21,"obeyed, and faithful to his trust"
  81,22,"No, your countryman² is not possessed"
  81,23,He saw him³ on the clear horizon
  81,24,He does not grudge the secrets of the unseen
  81,25,nor is this the utterance of an accursed demon
  81,26,Whither then are you going
  81,27,This is but an Admonition to all mankind
  81,28,to those among you that have the will to be upright
  81,29,"Yet you cannot will, except by the will of God, Lord of the Universe"
