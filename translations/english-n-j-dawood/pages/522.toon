quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"Messengers,‘ said he, ‘what is your errand?‘"
  51,32,"They said: ‘We are sent forth to a perverted people"
  51,33,that we may bring down on them a shower of clay-stones
  51,34,marked by your Lord for the destruction of the sinful.‘
  51,35,We led all the believers out of the town ―
  51,36,We found but one household of true Muslims ―
  51,37,and left therein a Sign for those who fear the woeful scourge
  51,38,And in Moses there was a sign. We sent him forth to Pharaoh with manifest authority
  51,39,"but he turned his back, he and his nobles, saying: ‘A sorcerer, or a man possessed.‘"
  51,40,"So We seized him and his warriors, and cast them into the sea. Indeed, he deserved much blame"
  51,41,In the fate of ‘Ād there was another sign. We let loose on them a blighting wind
  51,42,which pounded into dust all that it swept before it
  51,43,"And in Thamūd. They had been told: ‘Enjoy yourselves till a time decreed;‘"
  51,44,but they disobeyed the commandments of their Lord. The thunderbolt struck them as they looked on
  51,45,"they could not rise up from their fall, nor did they gain their end"
  51,46,And the people of Noah before them. Surely they too were a degenerate people
  51,47,"The heaven We built with mighty hands, giving it a vast expanse"
  51,48,"and stretched the earth beneath it: gracious is He who spread it out"
  51,49,"And all things We have made in pairs, so that you may take thought"
  51,50,Therefore seek God. From Him I come to you with clear warning
  51,51,You shall not set up another deity besides God. From Him I come to you with a clear warning
