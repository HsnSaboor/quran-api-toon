quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,HE¹ FROWNED and turned his back
  80,2,when the blind man came towards him
  80,3,How could you¹ tell? He might have sought to purify himself
  80,4,"He might have remembered, and remembrance might have done him good"
  80,5,But to the wealthy man
  80,6,you were all attention
  80,7,although the fault would not be yours if he remained uncleansed
  80,8,Yet to him that came to you with zeal
  80,9,and awe
  80,10,you paid no heed
  80,11,No! This is an Admonition
  80,12,"let him who will, bear it in mind"
  80,13,It is set down on honoured pages
  80,14,exalted and purified
  80,15,by the hands of devout and gracious scribes
  80,16,Noble and dutiful
  80,17,Let man perish! How ungrateful he is
  80,18,From what did He create him
  80,19,From a little germ He created him and gave him due proportion
  80,20,He made his path smooth for him
  80,21,then caused him to die and stowed him in a grave
  80,22,He will surely bring him back to life when He pleases
  80,23,Yet he declines to do His bidding
  80,24,Let man reflect on the food he eats
  80,25,how We pour down the rain in torrents
  80,26,and cleave the earth asunder
  80,27,how We bring forth the corn
  80,28,the grapes and the fresh vegetation
  80,29,the olive and the palm
  80,30,the thickets
  80,31,the fruit-trees and the green pasture
  80,32,for you and for your cattle to delight in
  80,33,But when the dread blast is sounded
  80,34,on that day each man will forsake his brother
  80,35,his mother and his father
  80,36,his consort and his children
  80,37,for each one of them will on that day have enough sorrow of his own
  80,38,On that day there shall be beaming faces
  80,39,laughing and joyful
  80,40,On that day there shall be faces covered with dust
  80,41,veiled with darkness
  80,42,These shall be the faces of the degenerate blasphemers
