quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,58,"If you call them to the prayer, they treat it as a jest and a diversion. This is because they are a people devoid of understanding"
  5,59,"Say: ‘People of the Book, is it not that you hate us only because we believe in God and in what has been revealed to us and what was formerly revealed, because most of you are ungodly?‘"
  5,60,"Say: ‘Shall I tell you who will receive a worse reward from God? Those whom God has cursed and with whom He has been angry, transforming them into apes and swine, and those who serve the devil. Worse is the plight of these, and they have strayed farther from the right path.‘"
  5,61,"When they came to you they said: ‘We are believers.‘ Indeed, infidels they came and infidels they departed. God knew best what they concealed"
  5,62,You see many among them rush headlong into sin and transgression and practise what is unlawful. Surely evil is what they do
  5,63,Why do their rabbis and divines not forbid them to blaspheme or to practise what is unlawful? Evil indeed are their doings
  5,64,"The Jews say: ‘God‘s hand is chained.‘ May their own hands be chained! May they be cursed for what they say! By no means. His hands are both outstretched: He bestows as He will. That which is revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase the wickedness and unbelief of many among them. We have stirred among them enmity and hatred, which shall endure till the Day of Resurrection. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, God puts it out. They prepetrate evil in the land, and God does not love the evil-doers"
