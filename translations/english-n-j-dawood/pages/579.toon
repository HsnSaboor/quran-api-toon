quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  76,6,a gushing spring at which the worshippers of God refresh themselves
  76,7,they who keep their vows and dread the far-flung terrors of a certain day
  76,8,"who, though they hold it dear, give sustenance to the destitute, the orphan, and the captive, saying"
  76,9,We feed you for God‘s sake only; we seek of you no recompense nor thanks
  76,10,for we fear from our Lord a day of anguish and of woe
  76,11,"God will deliver them from the evil of that day, and make their faces shine with joy"
  76,12,He will reward them for their steadfastness with Paradise and robes of silk
  76,13,"Reclining there upon soft couches, they shall feel neither the scorching heat nor the biting cold"
  76,14,"Trees will spread their shade around them, and fruits will hang in clusters over them"
  76,15,"They shall be served on silver dishes, and beakers as large as goblets"
  76,16,silver goblets which they themselves shall measure
  76,17,and cups brim-full with ginger-flavoured water
  76,18,from a fount called Salsabil
  76,19,"They shall be attended by boys graced with eternal youth, who to the beholder‘s eyes will seem like sprinkled pearls"
  76,20,"When you gaze and gaze upon that scene, you shall behold a kingdom blissful and glorious"
  76,21,"They shall be arrayed in garments of fine green silk and rich brocade, and adorned with bracelets of silver. Their Lord will give them pure nectar to drink"
  76,22,Thus shall you be rewarded; your endeavours shall earn much thanks
  76,23,It was We who sent down to you the Koran by gradual revelation
  76,24,"therefore await with patience the judgement of your Lord, and yield to none of them, sinner or blasphemer"
  76,25,Remember the name of your Lord morning and evening
