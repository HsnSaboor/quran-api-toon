quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,"By no means (such people will be redeemed): verily, the (personal) record of Al-Fujjar would be in Sijjin"
  83,8,And what did make you realise what Sijjin is
  83,9,A Record inscribed
  83,10,Woe that Day to the deniers
  83,11,those who deny the Day of Judgment
  83,12,"And a person does not deny it except every transgressing, sinning one"
  83,13,"When Our Verses are reproduced before him he said: “ Written material, in straight lines, of the initial people!”"
  83,14,"Nay! Of course, a rust has set in over their hearts because of what they had been earning (in their beliefs and deeds)"
  83,15,"Nay! Surely, they this Day, (would be) indeed those who have been veiled from (seeing) their Nourisher-Sustainer"
  83,16,"Afterwards, surely, they are indeed those who move on and become a part of the blazing Fire"
  83,17,"Then it will be said (to them): “This is what you had been committing denial thereof.”"
  83,18,"Nay! Surely, the (personal) record of Al-Abrar is indeed (kept) in ‘Iliyyun"
  83,19,And what made you realise what ‘Iliyyun is
  83,20,A Record inscribed
  83,21,Those made nearest (to God) will witness it
  83,22,"Surely, Al-Abrar will be in delights (of Paradise)"
  83,23,(Seated) on sofas they will watch
  83,24,You will recognise in their faces the brightness and freshness of delights
  83,25,They will be given to drink of a beverage — (fully) sealed (against contamination)
  83,26,Khitam (‘seal’ or ‘sealing material’ or ‘sealing process’ applied) unto it (contains) musk. Then (for this) must aspire the aspirants
  83,27,And its component will be from Tasnim
  83,28,a spring whereof drink those made nearest (to Allah and chosen by Him)
  83,29,"Verily, those who committed crimes (during their worldly life) used to laugh at those who Believed"
  83,30,And when they passed by them they would wink at each other (in mockery)
  83,31,"And when they returned to their house-hold or their followers, they returned as those who behave as happy-go-lucky people (jesting and exulting)"
  83,32,"And when they (i.e., the misled people) saw them (the Believers), they said: 'Undoubtedly all these people are indeed those who have lost the track"
  83,33,although they (the disbelievers or hypocrites) have not been imposed on them as watchers (or controllers)
  83,34,So this Day (in the Hereafter) those who Believed would laugh at the disbelievers
