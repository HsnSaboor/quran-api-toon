quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  17,8,It could be that your Nourisher-Sustainer bestows mercy unto you; but if you returned (to sinful life) We returned (for awarding punishment). And We have appointed Hell a prison for the disbelievers
  17,9,"Verily, this Al-Qur’an guides to that which is more lasting and gives glad-tidings to the Believers who do deeds of righteousness, that for them is a great reward"
  17,10,And that — those who do not believe in the Hereafter — We have prepared for them a painful torment
  17,11,And man invokes (Allah) for evil (in the same manner and style as) his invocation for good. And human being is ever hasty
  17,12,"And We have appointed the night and the day as two (of Our) signs. And the sign of the night We have made dark, and the sign of the day We have made brightening, that you may seek bounty from your Nourisher-Sustainer; and that you may know the number of the years and the reckoning. And We have provided details to all things — complete details"
  17,13,And to all humans — We have attached to him his recording for his deeds in his neck; and We shall eject out for him on the Day of Resurrection the record. He shall find it totally revealing
  17,14,"(It will be said to him): “Read your record. It became sufficient for your ownself today, (acting as) a reckoner against yourself"
  17,15,"That who adopted the guidance, then certainly what is true is that he adopts guidance in his own interest; and that who went astray, then surely what (is the fact is that) he strays at her cost (i.e., against his own Nafs). And does not bear burden, a bearer of burdens, the burden of another one. And We did not become those who impose punishment until We raise a Messenger"
  17,16,"And when We intended that We destroy a township We ordered its ‘upper-class’ (to return to the Book of Allah) but they indulged in Fisq therein, thus the order of torment became justified against it. Then We destroyed it in complete destruction"
  17,17,And how many generations have We destroyed after Nuh! And it became sufficient for your Nourisher-Sustainer to be All-Knower and All-Beholder of the sins of His Ibad
