quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,"And how would you disbelieve while you are — are reproduced unto you the Verses of Allah and among you is His Messenger. And whoever holds firmly to (the Book of) Allah, then indeed he has been guided to the Permanent Path"
  3,102,O you people who have Believed! Pay allegiance to Allah in accordance with the right of allegiance due to Him. And you must not die except while you are Muslims
  3,103,"And hold fast to the Rope of Allah (i.e., His Al-Kitab) as a group and divide not into sects, and bring to mind and discuss Allah’s grace on you when you were enemies (unto each other) but He put love and attachment in between your hearts, so you became, by His grace, brethren. And you were on the brink of a pit of Fire, then He saved you from it. Thus Allah explains for you His statements, perchance you may receive guidance"
  3,104,"And let there arise out of you an Ummah — they shall invite to (what is) Al-Khair (good and beneficial); they shall enjoin Al-Ma’ruf (the desirable) and they shall forbid against Al-Munkar (the undesirable); and those people: they are the successful ones"
  3,105,"And be not as those who divided and differed after whatever came to them (as) Al-Bayyinat! And those: for them is a punishment, extra-ordinary"
  3,106,"The Day (some) faces attain brightness and (some) faces become dark; then as those people — their faces became dark, (will be questioned): “Did you reject Faith after (attaining) your Belief? Then taste the punishment of what you had been rejecting and denying"
  3,107,"Then as those people — their faces become bright, so (they will be) in Allah’s mercy. They will abide therein"
  3,108,"These are the Verses of Allah: We reproduce them to you in original. And Allah desires not injustice to the worlds"
