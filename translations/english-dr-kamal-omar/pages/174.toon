quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  7,179,"And surely, We have brought out for Hell a multitude of the jinns and mankind: for them are hearts (yet) they understand not through them, and for them are eyes (yet) they see not therewith, and for them are ears (yet) they hear not therewith. They are like cattle; nay, they are more astray. They: they very ones are unaware"
  7,180,"And belong to Allah the very beautiful Attributes, so invoke Him through these and detach from those who introduce impurity in His Attributes (by invocking others through them); soon they would be rewarded for what they used to do"
  7,181,"And out of those whom We have created (there is) a community who guide with the help of Al-Haqq, and they establish justice therewith"
  7,182,"Those who have belied Our Ayaat, soon We shall carry them stage by stage from a place they will perceive not"
  7,183,And I (only) give respite to them; certainly My plan is very sophisticated
  7,184,"Did they not then ponder, there is no undue fanaticism in their companion (i.e., the Prophet goes not beyond limits while he preaches). He is not but an evident warner"
  7,185,"Did they not then look into the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever Allah has created out of anything; and may be that it happens (that) surely their term (in completing the life in this world) has already approached? So, in what Hadees, after this (Book) they shall develop their Faith"
  7,186,"Whomsoever Allah sends astray, then (there is) no guide for him, and He leaves them in their transgression — they wander blindly (therein)"
  7,187,"They put a query to you about the Hour: “When does its appointed time come?” Say: “Definitely it is that the knowledge thereof is with my Nourisher-Sustainer. None makes it manifest in accordance with its (fixed) time except He. It stood as a very extreme incident in the heavens and the earth. It shall not approach you people but all of a sudden.” They ask you as if you are well informed about it in advance. Say: “Definitely it is that its knowledge is with Allah (Alone), but most of mankind know not.”"
