quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,Nay! You people prefer the life of this world
  87,17,although the Hereafter is better and more lasting
  87,18,"Surely, this, indeed is in As-Suhuf-il-oola"
  87,19,(also in) Suhuf-e-Ibrahima wa Musa (‘ Surahs with Ibrahim and Musa’)
  88,1,Has the Hadees regarding Al-Ghashiyah (The overwhelming event) reached you
  88,2,Some faces that Day would be lowering themselves (in humiliation)
  88,3,"breathing with much effort, weary in look"
  88,4,they enter the fire that heats up (the human body giving it severe burns which dissolve the skin)
  88,5,they will be given to drink from a boiling hot spring
  88,6,There is not for them a food except out of poisonous thorny plant
  88,7,It provides no nourishment and nor provides relief from hunger
  88,8,(Some) faces that Day (will be)in full joy
  88,9,Regarding their endeavour — (these faces are) glad (and self satisfied)
  88,10,in Garden raised high
  88,11,These (people) shall not hear therein senseless speech
  88,12,Therein is a running spring
  88,13,Therein are beds raised high
  88,14,and cups set beautifully
  88,15,and cushions set in rows
  88,16,and rich carpets spread out
  88,17,"Do they then not look at the camels, how they are created"
  88,18,"and to the heaven, how it is raised"
  88,19,"and to the mountains, how they are rooted and fixed firm"
  88,20,"and at the earth, how it has been evenly spread out"
  88,21,"So do propagate; surely, what (is a fact is that) you are Muzakkir"
  88,22,You are not over them Musaitir
  88,23,But whoever turned away and disbelieved
  88,24,then Allah will punish him with a greater punishment (in the Hereafter)
  88,25,"Surely, towards Us is their final Return"
  88,26,"Then surely, on Us is their Accountability"
