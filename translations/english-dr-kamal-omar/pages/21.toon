quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,135,"And they said: “Become Hood or Nasaaraa — you would be guided.” Say: “Nay! (only) Millat of Ibrahim, the Unitarian. And he was not of Al-Mushrikun"
  2,136,"Say: “We have Believed in Allah and what has been delivered to us and what was delivered to Ibrahim and Ismaiel and Ishaque and Yaqub and Al-Asbat, and that which was given to Musa and Iesa (Jesus); and what was given to (other) Prophets from their Nourisher-Sustainer, WE MAKE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN ANY OF THEM and we are Muslims to Him. ”"
  2,137,"So if they have Believed in the same way as you have Believed, then verily, they are guided. And if they have turned away, then they are only in opposition. So very soon Allah will suffice you against them. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower"
  2,138,Colour (System or Religion) of Allah! And who is better than Allah in respect of Colour (System or Religion)? And we are obedient to Him alone
  2,139,"Say: “Would you cut arguments with us about Allah, and He is our Nourisher-Sustainer and your Nourisher-Sustainer. And my actions are for me and your actions for you. And we are sincere to Him"
  2,140,"Do you say that certainly Ibrahim and Ismaiel and Ishaque and Yaqub and Al-Asbat were hood or Nasaaraa? Say: “Do you know better or Allah? And who is more unjust than one who has concealed the evidence (received) from Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.”"
  2,141,"That was the Ummah which has passed away. For it is what it earned and for you, what you earned. And you will not be asked of what they used to do"
