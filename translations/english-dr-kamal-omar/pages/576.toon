quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,"Surely, he thought over and assessed (a plan against Al-Kitab)"
  74,19,"So, he has been condemned. How he assessed (and plotted)"
  74,20,"Again, he has been destroyed.How he assessed (and plotted)"
  74,21,Then he looked (all around to create a psychological atmosphere through his expressions)
  74,22,Then he frowned and scowled
  74,23,Then he took an about-turn and behaved disdainfully
  74,24,"Then he said: “It is nothing but magic being accepted (since times gone-by)"
  74,25,It is nothing but a statement of a human being.”
  74,26,Soon I cast him in Saqar (Hell-Fire)
  74,27,And what made you realise what (is meant by) Saqar
  74,28,"It spares not (any condemned person), and nor leaves (him unburnt)"
  74,29,one that completely burns and dissolves the skin of a human being
  74,30,Over it (are) nineteen
  74,31,"And We did not appoint the guardians of the Fire but angels; and We did not fix their number (which is 19) except as a test for the people who have disbelieved — in order that those who have been given Al-Kitab may develop certainty in Faith; and may increase Faith-wise those who have Believed; and may not harbour doubts and suspicions (in Al-Kitab) those who are given Al-Kitab and those who have already become Believers; and so that those in whose hearts is sickness and the disbelievers may comment: “What is that which Allah intended with the help of this example?” Thus Allah lets one go astray whom He thinks proper and gives guidance whom He thinks proper. And does not comprehend the forces of your Nourisher-Sustainer except He (Himself,). And this is not but zikrah (reminder) for man"
  74,32,Nay! The moon is a witness
  74,33,The night is a witness when it retreated
  74,34,Dawn is a witness when it brightened
  74,35,Surely this (phenomenon of Revelation) is indeed one of the major (events) —
  74,36,a warning for man —
  74,37,for that of you who desired that he should advance or he should hang back and await
  74,38,Every Nafs because of what she earned (remains) mortgaged
  74,39,except companions of the right (side)
  74,40,In Gardens — they will ask questions to one another —
  74,41,unto the sinners
  74,42,“What has caused you to enter Saqar?”
  74,43,"They said : “We were not of those who offer Prayers regularly"
  74,44,and we used not to feed the indigent
  74,45,and we used to talk uselessly alongwith those who indulge in senseless talhead of state
  74,46,and we used to deny the Day of Judgment
  74,47,"until there came to us the Certainty (i.e., the moment of death).”"
