quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  14,34,"And He gave you out of all items what you asked Him. And if you count the Blessings of Allah you will never (be able to) count them. Verily, man is indeed an extreme wrong-doer and an extreme disbeliever"
  14,35,"And (bring to mind) when Ibrahim said: ‘My Nourisher-Sustainer! Establish this city-one of peace and tranquility, and protect me and my sons that we may worship idols"
  14,36,"My Nourisher-Sustainer! Indeed, they have misled the majority of mankind. So whoso follows me, then certainly, he is of me and whoso disobeyed me, then surely, you are Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"
  14,37,"Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Indeed, I have settled out of my offspring by the valley devoid of cultivation, close to your Sacred and Honoured House (i.e., Kaba at Makka). Our Nourisher-Sustainer, that they may establish As-Salat (and may lead the congregation to True, Original and Vibrant Islam as contained in Your Al-Kitab); so make the hearts of the people incline towards them and provide them sustenance from fruits in order that they may give thanks"
  14,38,Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Certainly you know what we conceal and what we reveal. And does not remain hidden on Allah any thing in the earth and nor in the sky
  14,39,"Specified Praise suits Allah (Alone) Who bestowed for me, inspite of very old age, Ismaiel and Ishaque. Verily, my Nourisher-Sustainer is indeed All-Hearer of invocation"
  14,40,"My Nourisher-Sustainer! Make me one who establishes Salât and also from my offspring, our Nourisher-Sustainer! And accept my invocation"
  14,41,Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Bestow Forgiveness for me and for my parents and the Believers (at large) on the Day the Accountability-process gets established.”
  14,42,Consider not that Allah is unaware of that what the transgressors do. Surely it is that He gives them respite upto a Day wherein the eyes will stare in horror
