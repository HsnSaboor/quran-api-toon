quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  17,67,"And when adversity touched you at the sea, vanished (from you all those) whom you invoke (for help) except He (i.e., Allah) Alone. So when He brought you safely on the land, you slided back. And man is (ever) ungrateful"
  17,68,Have you then become secure — that He may cause a portion of the dry land sink down along with you (swallowing you up) or He may send against you a violent sand-storm? Then you shall find no wakil for yourself
  17,69,"Have you become secure — that He may send you back in this (sea) a second time and send against you a hurricane of wind and then drown you, because you disbelieved? Then you will not find for you, against Us, an avenger for that"
  17,70,"And surely, indeed We have honoured Bani-Adam (descendents of Adam), and We have carried them on land and sea, and have provided them as sustenance the palatable and lawful items, and have given them a higher rank over a vast majority out of those whom we created, in preference"
  17,71,"(And bring to mind) the Day We call all human beings with their Imam (‘one which guides and leads’. This is one of the attributes for Allah’s Book — i.e., Al-Kitab) so whosoever is given his record (of personal deeds) through his right side, then such people will read their record and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least"
  17,72,"And whosoever remained blind (i.e., he did not use his mind to acquire knowledge of Allah’s Book and then adopt it in life) in this (world), so he (will be) blind in the Hereafter and more astray regarding the path"
  17,73,"And if they could, they would surely tempt you away from that (Imam or Al-Kitab) which We revealed unto you, with the intention that you may (then) fabricate against Us something other than it; and then they would certainly have taken you a friend"
  17,74,And had We not made you firm (in your stand about Imam or Al-Kitab which you had to propagate) you would nearly have inclined to them a little
  17,75,"In that case, We would have surely made you taste increasing (punishment) in life and increasing (punishment) at death. In such a situation you do not find for yourself any helper against Us"
