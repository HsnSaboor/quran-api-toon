quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  71,11,He will direct the sky unto you (to behave as one) which rains heavily
  71,12,"and He would strengthen you with wealth and sons, and would establish for you gardens and set for you rivers"
  71,13,"What (is the matter) with you, you do not expect for Allah an absolute status"
  71,14,"Although, indeed He created you through diverse stages"
  71,15,"Have you not seen how Allah has brought into existence seven (or many) heavens, (having) fields one beyond another"
  71,16,and has set the moon therein as a light and made the sun (as) a radiant bright light
  71,17,And Allah made you grow (initially) from the earth as a growth
  71,18,"Then He returns you therein, and will take you out in a new appearance (on the Day of Resurrection)"
  71,19,And Allah has made for you the earth wide spread and levelled
  71,20,"that you may traverse some of it through tracks, wide and open"
  71,21,"Nuh said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Surely, they have disobeyed me, and they have followed one: his wealth and his children have not increased him except loss-wise"
  71,22,And they have devised an stratagem — a mighty plot
  71,23,"And they have said: ‘you shall not leave your gods; and nor you shall leave Wadd and nor Suwa’; and nor Yagus and Ya‘uq and Nasr"
  71,24,And indeed they have led astray many. And grant no increase to the transgressors except straying away (even further).”
  71,25,"Because of their sins they were drowned; then they were to enter the Fire. Then they did not find for themselves besides Allah, (any of the) helpers"
  71,26,"And Nuh said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Do not leave (alive) on the (face of the) earth, out of the disbelievers, (any) inhabitant"
  71,27,"Surely You! If You leave them, they will misguide Your Ibad; and they will not beget except a sinner, a disbeliever"
  71,28,"My Nourisher-Sustainer! Grant forgiveness for me and my two parents, and for that who entered my home as a Believer, and for the Believing males and the Believing females (at large). And do not increase the transgressors except destruction-wise.”"
