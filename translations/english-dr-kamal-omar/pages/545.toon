quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  58,22,"You will not find a nation who Believe in Allah and the Last Day (in a state that) they make friends that who opposed Allah and His Messenger — even though they happened (to be) their fathers (and fore-fathers), or their sons, or their brothers or their kindred. Those people: (Allah) has engraved Faith in their hearts and He has strengthened them with a Ruh (Spirit) proceeding from Him. And He will admit them to Gardens — flow underneath them rivers, abiders therein. Allah got pleased with them and they got pleased with Him. They are Hizbullah (Group of Allah). Beware! Verily, the group of Allah: they (very ones are) the successful ones"
  59,1,"Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth has glorified Allah. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise"
  59,2,"He it is Who drove out the disbelievers from among the possessors of Al-Kitab from their homes towards the first Al-Hashr (mass exodus). You thought not that they would come out, and they (themselves) became sure that they: their fortresses are shields unto them against Allah. So Allah came to them from a place they expected not; and He cast terror in their hearts. They will destroy their houses with their (own) hands and the hands of the Believers. So take admonition, O you possessors of the eyesights"
  59,3,"And if (had it) not (been) that Allah decreed for them the banishment, indeed He would have punished them in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is the torment of the Fire"
