quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  25,68,"And those who do not invoke alongwith Allah another ilah, and they do not murder (or kill or slay) a Nafs whom Allah has forbidden (to be killed) — except under demand of justice; and they do not commit Zina. And whoever commits this he will face a most grievous sin"
  25,69,"The punishment would be made more severe to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace —"
  25,70,"except that who repented and accepted Faith and did righteous deeds, then those people: Allah will change their sinful deeds into good deeds. And Allah is (Ever) Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"
  25,71,"And whosoever repented and acted righteously, then certainly he: he takes a turn to Allah — a desirable turn"
  25,72,"And those who do not give evidence (based) on falsehood, and when they passed by something indecent they passed on in grace and dignity"
  25,73,"and those (who) when they are subjected to preaching with the help of Ayaat of their Nourisher-Sustainer, respond not to them as if they are deaf and blind"
  25,74,"and those who say: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Grant us of our consorts and our children the delight of (our) eyes and make us Imam (model, leader or guide) for the righteous"
  25,75,"Those people will be rewarded with a suite (in Paradise) because they showed patience and greeting and word of peace will be made to descend over them, therein —"
  25,76,(becoming) abiders therein. It became excellent as a place of rest and as an abode
  25,77,"Say: “What my Nourisher-Sustainer may care for you, if there is no invokation from you?\" In such a case you have surely denied (His Majesty, Mercy and Grace). So (very) soon will appear the natural result (in the form of everlasting punishment). [If a person has Belief in Allah and His Capacities and His Attributes, he must invoke Him specially in periods of crisis and states of trouble — if he does not, he denies his own Belief in Him]"
