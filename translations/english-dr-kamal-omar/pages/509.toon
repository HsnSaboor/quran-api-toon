quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"And those who have Believed say: “Why is not a Surah sent down?” So when a decisive Surah has been sent and Qital (an armed encounter) has been mentioned therein — you have seen those in whose hearts is sickness — they look towards you with the look of one who has a shadow of death hanging over him. But preferable for them (is) —"
  47,21,"obedience and a straight forward statement. And when the decision (for Qital) became firm, then if they had remained truthful to Allah (in their commitment), surely it would have been better for them"
  47,22,"Would you then be tempted if you gained authority, that you may create mischief on the earth and cut off your wombs (i.e., sever your ties of kinship)"
  47,23,Those individuals are those whom Allah has cursed so He has made them deaf and has blinded their sights
  47,24,"Would they then not ponder deeply in Al-Quran, or (is it that) on the hearts (are set) locks of their own"
  47,25,"Verily, those who have turned away on their backs after Al-Huda became fully evident unto them — Satan has seduced them, while (Allah) has sanctioned a temporary respite for them"
  47,26,"That is because they said to those who hated what Allah has sent down: “Soon we obey you in some of the matters.” And Allah Knows their secret (thoughts)"
  47,27,Then how (will they protect their integrity) when the angels will cause them to die? They will smite their faces and their backs
  47,28,"That is because they followed which angered Allah, and they disliked His pleasure and assents. So He made their deeds go waste"
  47,29,Have those in whose hearts is sickness assessed that Allah will not expose their ill-wills and filthy plans
