quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  36,13,"And bring forward to them a similitude of the dwellers of the town, when there came to them the sent-ones"
  36,14,"when We sent to them two, but they belied both of them; so We reinforced (the propagation work) by a third one; so (all the three sent-ones) said: “Verily, we are unto you the sent-ones.”"
  36,15,"They (the residents of the town) said: “You are not but human beings like us, and Ar-Rahman has not sent down anything. You do not (act in truth) but you tell lies.”"
  36,16,"(The trio) said: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer knows (that) surely, indeed we are unto you the sent-ones"
  36,17,"and (there is) not (a responsibility) over us except a propagation, very plain and evident.”"
  36,18,"They (the people) said: “Surely, we have become caught in an evil omen because of you. Surely, if you do not desist (from propagating Al-Kitab), we will surely (reject and) drive you out, and indeed a painful punishment will touch you from us.”"
  36,19,"They said, “Your evil omens concern you whether you have been admonished — nay, you are a nation of those who cross (and transgress the limits and bounds given in Allah’s Book).”"
  36,20,"And there came running from the outskirts of Al-Madinah (The City), a man. He said: “O my nation! Obey the sent-ones"
  36,21,"obey that who does not ask you a reward, and they are rightly guided people"
  36,22,And what is to me that I may not pay obedience to that Who created me? And to Him you shall be returned
  36,23,"Shall I patronise aaliha (gods) besides Him? If Ar-Rahman intends me any harm, their intercession will not benefit me whatsoever, and they will protect me not (against the wrath of God)"
  36,24,"Surely, I (am) then, indeed, in manifest error"
  36,25,"Verily, I have come to Believe in your Nourisher-Sustainer, so listen to me!”"
  36,26,"(The disbelievers killed him and the martyr) was told: “Enter Paradise.” (The martyr) said (in his comments): “Oh (I) wish, my nation may know (the unseen) —"
  36,27,of that (that) my Nourisher-Sustainer provided forgiveness for me and He made me out of the honoured ones.”
