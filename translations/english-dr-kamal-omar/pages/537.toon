quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,Surely this indeed is Quranul Karim (‘An Honourable Reading or Recital’)
  56,78,"in the form of a Book, well guarded"
  56,79,Shall not approach it (for direct understanding) except Al-Muttahharun (those who have been cleansed of non-Divine human-influences in the matters of Religion)
  56,80,(It is) a Descent from (the) Nourisher-Sustainer of the worlds
  56,81,"Would then, with this Al-Hadees you are those who feel reluctance"
  56,82,"And you have made it your livelihood that you declare (this Book) as false. [You deny or damage the Unique status and position of Allah’s Scripture]"
  56,83,Then why don’t (you intervene) when (the soul of a dying person) has reached the throat
  56,84,and you are at that moment loohead of state on as a helpless person
  56,85,and We are nearer to this (dying person) than you (are) — but you see not
  56,86,Then why don’t you — if you are other than those whose abilities have been made limited (by Allah)—
  56,87,bring back that (soul which is leaving the body) — if you are those who speak the truth
  56,88,"So if it is, if he became of those who have been sanctioned nearness (to Allah)"
  56,89,(then for such a one is) rest and fragrance and a Garden of Bliss
  56,90,"So if it is, if he became of the Rightists"
  56,91,then (a greeting of) Salam unto you from the Rightists
  56,92,"And if it is, if he became of the deniers and the straying ones"
  56,93,then a 'reception' with boiling (water)
  56,94,and becoming a part of’ Hell-Fire
  56,95,"Verily, this (Scripture of Allah) surely it (is) Haqq-ul-Yaqin (‘Truth with Certainty’)"
  56,96,So make Glorifications with the Name of your Supreme Nourisher-Sustainer
  57,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and the earth has glorified Allah. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise"
  57,2,"To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He gives life, and He brings death; and He is All-Capable over every thing"
  57,3,"He is the Alpha (The First One) and the Omega (The Last One), and The Manifest, and The Hidden. And He is All-Aware with every thing"
