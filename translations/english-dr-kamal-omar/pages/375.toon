quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,184,And obey That Who created you and the generations of the earlier people
  26,185,"They said: “ Certainly what (is a fact is that) you are of those who are under effect of sorcery"
  26,186,"And you are not but a human being like us, and surely, we regard you definitely of those who are liars"
  26,187,So cause a piece (of some rock) to descend on us from the direction of the sky (to destroy us) if you are of the truthful.”
  26,188,"(Shuaib) said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer knows better what you people do (and what you deserve in punishment).”"
  26,189,"So they belied him, then the torment seized them in the day of over-shadowing gloom. Indeed, it was a punishment of a dreadful day"
  26,190,"Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not Believers"
  26,191,"And verily, your Nourisher-Sustainer: truly He is the All-Mighty, the continuously Merciful"
  26,192,"And truly, this (Al-Kitab) is surely a Descent from the Nourisher-Sustainer of the worlds"
  26,193,Descended with it Ar-Ruh-ul-Amin (The Trustworthy Spirit)
  26,194,to your heart so that you become of the warners
  26,195,in the clearly evident Arabic tongue
  26,196,"And surely, this (Al-Kitab) is indeed in the Zubur [this is plural of Zabur and it means sheets (of written material)] of the earlier people"
  26,197,And is it not a sign to them that the learned people of Bani Israiel are conversant with it
  26,198,And if We had made it to descend unto some of those whose mother tongue is not Arabic
  26,199,"then he had read it unto them, they would not have become Believers thereto"
  26,200,Thus have We caused it (disbelief in Al-Kitab) to enter into the hearts of the sinful
  26,201,they will not Believe in it until they see the painful torment
  26,202,So it shall approach them all of a sudden while they will not perceive (it)
  26,203,"So they will say: “Will we become those who are granted some respite?”"
  26,204,Do they then wish to be hastened on regarding punishment to proceed from Us
  26,205,Have you marked? If We provided them provisions for years
  26,206,"after that, reached them what they had been promised"
