  23,93,"Say: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! If you show me what they are promised"
  23,94,my Nourisher-Sustainer! Then place me not amongst the nation of transgressors.”

This word refers to kinship or genealogical links) amongst them that Day, nor will they ask one another (on this subject). [Associating to a certain family, race or genealogical tree would avail nothing on the Day of Judgement. People will not even ask one another about their descendence or ancestry]"
  23,102,"Then that whose scales (of good deeds) became heavy — then those: they are the successful ones"
  23,103,And that whose scales (of good deeds) became very light (in comparison to his evil deeds)–then they are those who lost their ownselves; in Hell (they will be) dwellers
