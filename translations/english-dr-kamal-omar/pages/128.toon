quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,1,"Selective Praise suits Allah, the Being Who created the heavens and the earth and established the darkness and the light, yet those who have disbelieved hold others as equal with their Nourisher-Sustainer"
  6,2,"He it is Who has created you out of clay, then He decreed a (stated) term (or life-span for you) and (another) specified term in His Presence, yet you are: you are doubting (in the truthfulness of the Hereafter)"
  6,3,And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth. He knows what is hidden in you and is (made) evident by you and He knows what you earn (as good or evil)
  6,4,"And does not come to them a Verse from the Verses of their Nourisher-Sustainer but they became to it, those who turn away"
  6,5,Then indeed they rejected Al-Haqq when it came to them. So very soon shall come to them the news of what they had been mochead of state thereat
  6,6,Have they not pondered how many We destroyed before them out of generation(s) — We established them on the earth to the extent We did not establish (the civilization) for you. And We showered (from) the heaven over them in abundance and We made the rivers flow from underneath them. Then We destroyed them for their sins and We brought into being after them a generation of latter ones
  6,7,"And even if We had sent down unto you a Book (descending from heaven, and written) on paper (and) then surely they could touch it with their hands, indeed those who have disbelieved (would have) said: “This is nothing but obvious magic!”"
  6,8,"And they said: “Why not has been sent down to him an angel?” And if We had sent down an angel, indeed (then) the matter would have been settled — in such a case they would not be given (any) respite"
