quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,"And that we: out of us (some are) Muslims, and out of us are Al-Qasitun (unjust people, who disobey the Desired Path). So whosoever embraced Islam, then those people have selected,out of their free will something highly desireable. ”"
  72,15,"And as for Al-Qasitun: so they became firewood (or fuel) for Hell"
  72,16,"And that if they had stood constantly on the (Desired) Path, indeed We would have given them to drink water in abundance —"
  72,17,"so that We may test and assess them therein. And whoever disengages (himself) from Zikr of his Nourisher-Sustainer, He will make him slide in to a rising punishment"
  72,18,And that the Mosques are dedicated to Allah (alone). So don’t invoke alongwith Allah any one
  72,19,"And that it (i.e., the situation is like this): when Abdullah (a human subject of Allah) stood — he invokes Him (Alone, in Prayer), they (who do not accept the absolute Oneness of Allah) almost became (as if) they are becoming unto him an overpowering crowd"
  72,20,"Tell (them): “Certainly what (is true is that) I do invoke my Nourisher-Sustainer, and I do not associate in partnership to Him any one.”"
  72,21,"Tell (them): “Surely I, I do not own (any) harm regarding you, and nor something very desirable.”"
  72,22,"Tell (them): “Certainly I: will never protect me against Allah, any one; and I will never find besides Him a place of refuge —"
  72,23,"except propagation (coming) from Allah and His Messages. And whosoever will disobey Allah and His Messenger, then surely, for him is the Fire of Hell. (They would be) abiders therein forever.”"
  72,24,"Until when they have seen what they are being promised, then soon they will understand who is a weaker helper and lesser number-wise"
  72,25,"Tell (them): “I know not whether it is very near what you are promised, or my Nourisher-Sustainer sets for it a distant term.”"
  72,26,(He alone is) the All-Knower of al-ghaib (the unseen). So He does not make informed about His ghaib any one —
  72,27,"except whom He agreed out of a Messenger. Then surely He drives and moves in between his two hands (i.e., forward, in front of him) and on his back (invisible angel-escorts) as body- guards"
  72,28,"so that He may know that they have indeed propagated Risalaat (‘Messages’.) of their Nourisher-Sustainer. And He kept in surveillance whatever (remained) with them, and He counted each and every thing number-wise"
