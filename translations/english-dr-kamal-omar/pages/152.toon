quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  7,12,"(Allah) said: “What prevented you (O Iblis) that you did not prostrate when I commanded you?” (Iblis) said, “I am superior to him since you created me out of fire while you created him out of clay.”"
  7,13,"(Allah) said: “Get you out from this (place). Further, it is not for you that you indulge in arrogance over here. Get you out. Definitely you are out of those who are low (as such are the ones who boast on their genealogical links to hide their personal weaknesses).”"
  7,14,"(Iblis) said: “Allow me respite till the Day they are raised up (in Resurrection).”"
  7,15,"(Allah) said: “Definitely you are out of those who are given respite.”"
  7,16,"(Iblis) said: “Since You have declared me astray, surely I will block for them Your Permanent Path"
  7,17,"Further on, surely I will approach them from before them and from behind them and from their right sides and from their left sides, and You will not find the majority of them as thankful ones (hence they will not properly obey You).”"
  7,18,"(Allah) said: “Get out from this (place) disgraced and expelled. Surely whoever obeyed you out of them, (then) surely I will fill Hell out of you all"
  7,19,"And O Adam! Dwell you and your consort in the orchard, so both of you eat from where you two desired and both of you must not approach this particular tree, otherwise you both become out of the transgressors.”"
  7,20,"Then Satan whispered undesirable suggestions to them both, so that he may uncover over them what was kept hidden to both of them out of the bodies of these two. And (Satan) said: “The Nourisher-Sustainer of you two has not stopped you two from this particular tree except that you two be two angels or you two be of those who are immortals.”"
  7,21,"And he took an oath before those two (saying): “Verily, I am to you twain, without any doubt, out of those who give constructive advice.”"
  7,22,"So he bewitched them both with deceptive (and imaginary ideas). So when the twain tasted the particular tree, the bodies of those two became in view to both of them and both of them began: both of them start covering over both of themselves out of the (huge-sized) leaf of the orchard. And the Nourisher-Sustainer of these two called out both of them: “Did I not stop you both from this particular tree and I tell you both: Verily, the Satan is an open enemy to you both?”"
