quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,41,And O my nation! What (is) to me? I call upon you to salvation while you invite me to the Fire
  40,42,"You invite me so that I may disbelieve in Allah and commit shirk (polytheism) with Him for which there is no knowledge in me; and I invite you to the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving"
  40,43,"No doubt that, a certain one, you call me towards him — there is no (title) for him to be called upon in this world, and nor in the Hereafter. And that our return is (certainly) to Allah and that those who cross the limits: they (are to be the) dwellers of the Fire"
  40,44,"So soon you will discuss and realise what I utter for you; and I entrust my affair to Allah. Verily, Allah is All-Seer of (His) Ibad.”"
  40,45,So Allah saved him from the evils of whatever they planned; and the evil of the punishment encircled the Aal-e-Firaun —
  40,46,"the Fire, they are exposed to it (every) morning and evening (even during the silent phase which is called Barzakh). And (the) Day the Hour establishes (itself, it will be proclaimed): 'Cast Aal-a-Firaun in a more severe punishment"
  40,47,"And when they will dispute with one another in the Fire, so the weak-ones will say to those who remained proud, arrogant and dominant: “We were submissive unto you, so are you those who are able to remove from us a portion out of the Fire?”"
  40,48,"Those who remained proud, arrogant and dominant (in their worldly life) said: “Verily we, all (of us have to stay) therein! Verily, Allah has surely pronounced judgment amongst (His) Ibad.”"
  40,49,"And said those (who were staying) in the Fire to the keepers of Hell: “Call upon your Nourisher-Sustainer, (so that) He may lighten from us, out of the punishment (at least) for a day.”"
