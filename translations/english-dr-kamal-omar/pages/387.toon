quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  28,14,"And when he attained his full strength and became perfect We bestowed unto him Hukman (decision-power) and Ilman (knowledge, in accordance with Allah’s Book). And thus do We reward the Muhsinun (those who do good in perfection without expecting any reward from men)"
  28,15,"And he entered the city at a time of unawareness from its residents, and he found therein two male-adults fighting among themselves — this (one) from his group, and this (one) from (the group of) his enemy. Then he who was from his group asked him for assistance against that who was from (the group of) his enemy. So Musa struck him with a fist and he (through this blunt injury) completed (his life-span) to him (i.e., the man died). (Musa) said: “This is out of Satan’s handiwork; indeed he is an enemy, a manifest misleader.”"
  28,16,"(Musa) said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Verily, I have wronged myself, so forgive me.” So He forgave him. Surely, He: He is the Oft-Forgiving, the continuously Merciful"
  28,17,"(Musa) said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! With what (swiftness) You showered grace over me, so I will never be a helper for criminals"
  28,18,"He faced the morning in the city as one who is apprehensive; he also feels cautious. So, behold! That one who sought his help the day before, (again) calls him for help. Musa said to him: “Surely, you are indeed an evidently misguided one.”"
  28,19,"So when as he intended that he may get hold of that: he is an enemy to both of them, he said: “O Musa! Do you intend that you may slay me as you killed a person yesterday? You do not intend but that you become a tyrant in the land; and you do not intend that you become of those who bring reform.”"
  28,20,"And there came a male-adult, from the farther end of the city: he runs hastily. He said: “O Musa! Verily, the chiefs (of the state) are tahead of state counsel together about you that they may kill you, so escape (immediately). Truly, I am to you of those who (are well-wishers and) give sincere advice"
  28,21,"So (Musa) escaped from there as one who is apprehensive and in fear — he feels very cautious. He said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Rescue me from the nation of Zalimun (transgressors)"
