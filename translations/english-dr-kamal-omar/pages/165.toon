  7,121,"They said: “We have developed Faith and Belief in the Nourisher-Sustainer of the worlds"
  7,122,The Nourisher-Sustainer of Musa and Harun!”
  7,123,"Firaun said: “Have you developed Faith in Him (even) before that I gave permission to you? Surely this is a plot which you have hatched in the city so that you may drive out from it its rightful residents, so very soon you will come to know (about my retaliation)"
  7,124,"Surely, I will cut off your hands and your legs from opposite (sides); further on, I will surely put you on the stakes (and crucify you) altogether.”"
  7,125,"They said: “Verily, to our Nourisher-Sustainer (we become) those who return"
  7,126,And you do not take vengeance against us except that we developed Faith in the Signs of our Nourisher-Sustainer as and when (these signs) came to us. Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Pour on us perseverance in patience and cause us to die as Muslims.”
  7,127,"And said the chiefs of the nation of Fir’aun: “Will you leave Musa and his nation that they may spread mischief in the land and he may abandon you and your gods?” (Fir’aun) said: “Soon we will kill their sons and let live their women and surely we, over them, are irresistible ones (in power and military force).”"
  7,128,"Said Musa to his nation: “Invoke assistance in Allah and be patient with perseverance. Definitely the earth belongs to Allah. He allots it in inheritance whom He thinks proper among His Ibad. And the final end (goes) in favour of the righteous ones"
  7,129,"They said: “We were put to sufferings before you came to us and (even) afterwards as you came to us.” (Musa) said: “It is expected of your Nourisher-Sustainer that He destroys your enemy and make you settling successors on earth (and) then watch how you act upon.”"
  7,130,"And indeed, We involved the followers of Fir’aun with years (of drought) and decreased flow of fruits so that they might be reminded (towards the Book of Allah) and they might remind others (to it)"
