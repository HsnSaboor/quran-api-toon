quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  3,122,"When two groups from among you intended that they two may become defensive, although Allah was their Wali: and in Allah the Believers must put their trust"
  3,123,"And certainly, Allah provided you help and aid at Badr when you were weak (a tiny little military force, not properly armed). So be mindful of Allah so that you may (thus) pay thanks"
  3,124,"(Remember) when you say to the Believers: Is it not enough for you that your Nourisher-Sustainer helps you with three thousand (force) of the angels caused to descend (to fight on your side)?”"
  3,125,"Yes! If you hold on to patience and stick to obedience, and they (i.e., your enemies) approach you in their fury (more serious than) this: your Nourisher-Sustainer will assist you with five thousand of the angels, specially assigned (for vehement attacks)"
  3,126,"Allah made it not but as an encouraging news for you and so that your hearts get solace thereby. And no aid and assistance (comes) except from Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise"
  3,127,"that He might cut off a part of those who disbelieved or cast them down to infamy, so that they return frustrated"
  3,128,Not for you (is the responsibility) in the matter in any way whether He turns to them (in mercy) or punishes them because certainly they are transgressors
  3,129,And to Allah belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. He forgives for whom He thinks proper and He punishes whom He thinks proper. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving continuously Merciful
  3,130,"O you who have Believed! Devour not Riba (usury) marked up and multiplied, and pay obedience to Allah that you may be successful"
  3,131,And take protection against the Fire which is prepared for the rejectors
  3,132,And obey Allah and the Messenger so that you may be placed under mercy
