  15,18,"except that (devil) who attempted theft of listening, so a manifestly clear flaming object chased him (to burn him to ashes)"
  15,19,"And the earth, We spread out and pegged therein firm mountains; and We caused to grow therein all kinds of things in due proportion"
  15,20,"And provided for you therein means of sustenance and also (for) that one for whom you are not the providers of sustenance — (like insects, beasts, cattle, amphibians and numerous other seen and unseen creation)"
  15,21,"And there is not out of a thing, but with Us are the unending stores thereof and We do not send it down except in a well-known measure"
  15,22,"And We sent the winds, the filling ones (which saturate the clouds with water-vapour), then We showered rains from towards the sky, then We made you to drink that (clean and distilled water) and you are not the owners of stores of this (water)"
  15,23,"And certainly We, indeed We, We give life and We cause death and We are the Inheritors"

  15,25,"And verily, your Nourisher-Sustainer: He will gather you (all). Truly, He is All-Wise, All-Knowing"
  15,26,"And indeed, We created mankind from sounding clay of a black fermented mud"
  15,27,"And the jinn, We created aforetime from the flaming, smokeless fire"
  15,28,"And (bring to mind) when your Nourisher-Sustainer said to the angels: “Surely, I am about to be a Creator of a human being from sounding clay of a black fermented mud"
  15,29,"So when I have fashioned him completely and I have breathed into him of My Spirit, then you become for him as those who prostrate (to Me)"
  15,30,"So, the angels prostrated, all of them, en masse"
