quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,6,"(It goes as) a Promise from Allah. Allah does not act against His Own Promise, but the majority of people do not know"
  30,7,"They know only the apparent from the immediate life, and they, about the after-effects — they are heedless, ignorant ones"
  30,8,"Do they then not ponder in their ownselves (that) Allah did not create the heavens and the earth and whatever is between those two except for a due purpose and (for) an appointed term? And indeed, the majority of mankind regarding the meeting with their Nourisher-Sustainer, are surely disbelievers"
  30,9,"Do they then not travel in the land that they may see what became the end of those before them? They were mightier than these in physical power; and they tilled the earth and populated it even more than what the (present) people have inhabited it. And there came to them their Messengers with Al-Bayyinat. So Allah was not (such) that He may wrong them, but they had been doing wrong to themselves"
  30,10,"Then the ultimate end of those who did evil, was evil, because they belied Ayaatullahe (‘The Signs and Verses of Allah’) and they used to mock at this"
  30,11,"Allah originates the creation, then He will repeat it, then to Him you people will be returned"
  30,12,"And the Day the Hour establishes (itself), the criminals will feel sorry"
  30,13,And there became not for them out of their self-assigned partners (to Allah) any intercessors; and they (themselves) became rejectors for their self-assigned partners
  30,14,And the Day the Hour establishes — this Day (mankind) shall be separated
  30,15,"Then as for those who Believed and performed righteous deeds — so they, in the Garden, will be made to enjoy scholarly discussions"
