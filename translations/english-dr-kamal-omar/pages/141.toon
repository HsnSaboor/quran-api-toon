quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,102,"This is Allah, your Nourisher-Sustainer. La ilaha illa Huwa, Creator of all things, so pay obedience to Him (Alone). And He is Wakil over all things"
  6,103,"The eyes comprehend Him not while He comprehends the sights. And He is the Keenest Observer, the Most Well-informed"
  6,104,"Surely, have come to you eye-openers from your Nourisher-Sustainer. So whoever saw (and understood) so (it is) to the benefit of his ownself and whosoever remained blind (and made no effort to understand) so (it goes) against her. And I am not, over you, a watcher"
  6,105,"And thus We scatter (in the Text) Ayaat so that they may say: “You have studied (deeply) and (you have) taught (us effectively), and that We may make it fully clear for the nation who have knowledge"
  6,106,"Follow that which has been inspired to you from your Nourisher-Sustainer, La ilaha illa Huwa, and turn aside from Al-Mushrikun"
  6,107,"And if Allah had willed they would not have indulged in shirk. And We have not made you a watcher over them; and you are not over them as a wakil (disposer of affairs, guardian or advocate)"
  6,108,"And do not call names of those whom they invoke besides Allah, otherwise they would call names of Allah out of enmity (to you) without knowledge. Thus We have made fair-seeming to each ummah their doing. Then to their Nourisher-Sustainer is their returning place, then He shall inform them of that which they had been doing"
  6,109,"And they sweared by Allah their oaths strongly that if there came to them a sign, surely they would Believe in it. Say: “Definitely it is so that the Signs are with Allah. And what will make you (Muslims) perceive that it — when it came, they will not Believe"
  6,110,"And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes (away from true guidance) as what they did not Believe therein for the first time and We shall leave them in their arrogance, they shall blindly wander (therein)"
