quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  58,12,"O you who have accepted Faith! When you had a private discussion with the Messenger, then arrange in advance between the two hands of your private discussion (i.e., prior to your private discussion) some donation. This is better for you and purer. But if you found not (due to your weak economic position), then certainly Allah is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"
  58,13,"Did you become disturbed that you may arrange prior to your private discussion some donations? So when you did not do it and Allah (still) turned to you (in Mercy), then establish As-Salat and pay Az-Zakat, and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah is All-Aware with what you practice"
  58,14,"Have you not seen towards those who took as friends a nation upon whom Allah has set His wrath? They are not of you and nor of them and they take oath on something which is false and untrue, while they know (the correct situation)"
  58,15,"Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment. Certainly they: evil (it is) what they used to practice"

  58,17,"Will never provide them benefit their wealth, and nor their children against Allah to any extent. They (will be) dwellers of the Fire. They will be abiders therein"
  58,18,"The Day Allah resurrects them all together, then they will swear to Him in the same way as they swear to you (Muslims). And they think that they (take a stand) on something. Beware! Surely they: they (very ones are) the liars"
  58,19,"Satan has found a grip over them, so he has made them forget Zikr (‘Message’) of Allah. They are (the) party of Satan. Beware! Verily, the party of Satan: they (very ones are) the losers"
  58,20,"Certainly, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger: they (will be) among the lowest ones"
  58,21,"Allah has written down (in His Al-Kitab): “Surely I shall be Victorious: I as well as My Messengers!” Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty"
