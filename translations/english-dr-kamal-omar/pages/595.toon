quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,The sun acts as a witness and its brightness
  91,2,"and the moon when it received its due (i.e., the light) from it"
  91,3,"and the day-time when it made it (i.e., the sun) brightly appearing"
  91,4,"and the night when it conceals it (i.e., the sun)"
  91,5,"and the heaven, and how (beauitiful and vast) He built it"
  91,6,"and the earth, and how (evenly) He spread it"
  91,7,and Nafs and how He made it proportionate
  91,8,"then He provided her (i.e., to the Nafs, an inherent ability in conscience, mind or heart to point out) evils unto her and piety unto her"
  91,9,Indeed he has succeeded whoever purified her (the Nafs)
  91,10,"And indeed he lost who corrupted her (i.e., the Nafs)"
  91,11,"Samud (people) denied through the arrogant, rebellious behaviour of her (i.e., of the Nafs)"
  91,12,when one of the most wicked of that (habitation) came forward (in bad intention)
  91,13,"So Rusulullah (Messenger of Allah) said to them: “(behave properly with the) she-camel of Allah and (bear and tolerate) her (nature) as a female who drinks more water (than other animals and beings)"
  91,14,"Then they belied him; so they hamstrung her (mahead of state her incapacitated to approach the site of water-supply). So their Nourisher-Sustainer brought over them severe whipping because of their crime, so He levelled these (people and their city in a complete destruction)"
  91,15,And (Allah) fears not about its consequences
  92,1,The night acts as a witness when it envelops (and conceals from view many things)
  92,2,and the day-time when it makes (many things) bright
  92,3,and whatever He created in pairs as the male and the female
  92,4,"Surely, your endeavour is indeed diverse (in directions and targets)"
  92,5,"So as for that who gave (i.e., spent as desired in the ordainments of Al-Kitab), and remained obedient (to Allah)"
  92,6,and testified to the best (law in Al-Kitab by adopting it)
  92,7,"So, soon We provide him facility for Al-Yusrah"
  92,8,And as for that who behaved niggardly and remained unconcerned
  92,9,and belied the best (law in Al-Kitab)
  92,10,"then soon, We let him slide to Al-Usrah"
  92,11,And shall not benefit him his wealth when he has slided to destruction
  92,12,"Verily, on Us indeed (is the duty to provide) the True Guidance"
  92,13,"And truly for Us (is) indeed (the ownership of) the Hereafter and the initial, present (world)"
  92,14,So I have warned you of (the) Fire — it is blazing fiercely
