quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,"The Fig acts as a witness, and the olive (see)"
  95,2,and Mount Seeneen
  95,3,"and this Trustee City (which is protected and protects the rituals of Religion, like Salat, Tawaf, Umra, Hajj and I'tikaf)"
  95,4,"Surely, without doubt, We created the human being in better stability and capacity (regarding choice, wisdom and understanding etc)"
  95,5,Thereafter We allowed him to turn lowest of the low —
  95,6,"excluding those who Believed and performed righteous deeds. So, for them is a reward — not interrupted (and never to be) stopped"
  95,7,Then what makes you deny after (knowing all these facts) the Accountability
  95,8,Is not Allah the Better Judge among all who judge
  96,1,Read with the Name of your Nourisher-Sustainer — That Who created
  96,2,He created the human being out of a living matter attached (like a leech) hanging (from the internal surface of the womb)
  96,3,Read and your Rabb is More Generous
  96,4,That Who taught — with the pen
  96,5,thus He taught the human being what he knew not
  96,6,"By no means ! Verily, the human being, indeed, transgresses the bounds"
  96,7,as he noticed himself that he has attained self-sufficiency (in all provisions)
  96,8,"Surely, unto your Nourisher-Sustainer would be the Final Return"
  96,9,Have you noticed him who prohibits
  96,10,(My) Abd when he offered Salat
  96,11,Have you pondered if (this Abd) happened to be on Al-Hudah (‘The Guidance’)
  96,12,or he enjoined obedience (to One God)
  96,13,"Have you (ever) thought if (the other one who stopped My Abd from offering Salat), has denied and has turned away"
  96,14,Did he not know that Allah does see
  96,15,"By no means! Surely, if he did not desist, indeed We shall seize (him) by the forelock"
  96,16,"a lying, denying, sinful forelock"
  96,17,"Then, let him call his league (or council of helpers)"
  96,18,soon We call the executioners (to deal with such defiant opponents)
  96,19,By no means (such an apostate will become a hurdle in the Way of Islam)! Do not obey him. And do perform prostration and become close and near (to Allah)
