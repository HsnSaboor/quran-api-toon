quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"(Ibrahim) said: “So, what is your mission, O you who have been sent?”"
  51,32,"(The angels) said: “Surely we, we have been sent to the nation of sinners"
  51,33,so that we may shower over them stones of clay
  51,34,(stored and) marked with your Nourisher-Sustainer for those who commit excesses. ”
  51,35,So We brought out (to safety) that who was therein out of the Believers
  51,36,But We found not therein other than (only) one house out of the Muslims
  51,37,"And therein (i.e., within this incident) We left a sign for those who fear the painful torment"
  51,38,And in (the incident of) Musa (there is also a lesson) when We sent him to Firaun with Sultanin Mobin (‘Manifest Power’)
  51,39,"But (Firaun) turned away in the pride of might and power, and said: “(This Messenger is) a sorcerer or a fanatic.”"
  51,40,"So We seized him and his military forces; then We threw them (all) into the sea, while he was one who blamed (his ownself)"
  51,41,And in (the destruction of) the ’Ad (-people is also a lesson) when We directed against them a destroying wind (-storm)
  51,42,"it spares not of anything over which it blew, except that it turned it into something like a destroyed and decomposed matter"
  51,43,"And in (the incident of) Samud (there is also a lesson) when it was said unto them: “Enjoy yourself for a limited period.”"
  51,44,"Then they insolently defied the command of their Nourisher-Sustainer, so the Sa’iqa (thunder-bolt) overtook them while they were loohead of state on"
  51,45,"So they could not be able to continue (their existence), and they did not behave as those who acquire assistance and aid and then take revenge"
  51,46,"And the nation of Nuh since before: they had remained a nation of Fasiqun"
  51,47,"And the heaven: We constructed it with (Our Own) hands; and surely We are indeed those Who make expansion and create vastness"
  51,48,"And the earth: We spread it out; so what Excellent Spreaders (We are)"
  51,49,"And to every thing We have created pairs, perchance you may remind (yourselves and remind others)"
  51,50,"So run swiftly towards Allah. Verily, I am unto you, from Him, a warner — plain (and evident)"
  51,51,"And do not set up alongwith Allah another ilahan (god). Verily, I am unto you, from Him, a warner — plain (and evident)"
