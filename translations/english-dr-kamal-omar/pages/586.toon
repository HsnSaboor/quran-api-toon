quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun is Kuwwirat (wrapped up as a round body)
  81,2,and when the stars lost the light and lustre
  81,3,and when the mountains are made to move
  81,4,"and when the she camels, ten-months’ pregnant are abandoned"
  81,5,and when the beasts are gathered together (in fear)
  81,6,and when the seas are made to flow forth (one into the other)
  81,7,"and when the Nufus (this is a plural of Nafs) are united (i.e., the body and soul are again united)"
  81,8,and when the female (infant) buried alive is asked —
  81,9,for what sin she has been killed
  81,10,And when the files (or the records of deeds) are laid open
  81,11,and when the heaven is stripped off
  81,12,and when the Hell-Fire is put to full blaze
  81,13,and when the Paradise is brought closeby
  81,14,"(then and there) a Nafs has come to know what has she brought (as her concepts, beliefs and deeds)"
  81,15,"Then, nay! I bring to witness (the heavenly bodies) that disappear and hide themselves (during the day)"
  81,16,"who are in swift motion, (yet are those) who remain hidden from view"
  81,17,and the night when it departed
  81,18,and the day when it started (its) breath
  81,19,(that) undoubtedly it is indeed a Statement coming via an honoured messenger (to His Abd)
  81,20,"(This emissary is) possessor of power and authority. (This arch-Angel, Jibriel is) stationed close to the Owner of the Throne (i.e., Allah)"
  81,21,(He is one) who is obeyed and paid allegiance; moreover he is trustworthy (spirit)
  81,22,And your companion (who is propagating the Message of God to you is) not a fanatic
  81,23,"And surely, indeed he has seen him (i.e., the arch-angel) on the clear eastern horizon"
  81,24,And he is not who keeps something hidden regarding Al-ghaib (the unseen)
  81,25,"And it is not a statement from Satan, the rejected and expelled"
  81,26,Then where do you go? (Do you reject Al-Kitab and seek illegitimate source for Religious knowledge)
  81,27,This is not but Zikrun-lil-Alamin (‘A Message unto the worlds’)
  81,28,for whomsoever desired amongst you that he may set (himself) in permanence
  81,29,And you people desire not except that Allah (so) desires; (He is) Nourisher-Sustainer to the worlds
