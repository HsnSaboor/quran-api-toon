quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  35,31,"And what We have inspired you in the form of Al-Kitab, it is Al-Haqq — being one that confirms or rebrings that which is between its two hands (i.e., which is already available with the people before you). Verily, Allah is indeed All-Aware, All-Seer of His Ibad"
  35,32,"Then We made inheritors of Al-Kitab, those whom We chose out of Our Ibad. So of them (is that) who is a transgressor against his own self, and of them (is that) who adopts a middle course, and of them (is that) who is foremost in good deeds under permission of Allah. That — that (indeed is) the supreme grace"
  35,33,"Gardens of Eternity, they will enter therein, they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, and (they would use) pearls, and their garment therein will be silk"
  35,34,"And they said: “Selective Praise suits Allah, Who has removed from us (all) grief. Verily, our Nourisher-Sustainer is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate"
  35,35,"That Who settled us in an ever-lasting home out of His Grace; toil will touch us not therein, and nor will touch us therein any weariness"
  35,36,And those who have disbelieved — for them will be the Fire of Hell. (The punishment) shall not be made complete unto them that they may die; and nor shall be made light unto them out of its punishment. Thus We shall reward all the extreme disbelievers
  35,37,"And they — they will be carried therein : \"Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Bring us out, we shall perform righteous deeds quite different from what we used to do.” (Allah will remark): \"And did We not give you lives long enough, so that, may receive admonition therein who came in contact with admonition. And the warner came to you (but you paid no heed.) So taste (the end result of your deeds).\" So, there is not for the transgressors, out of a helper"
  35,38,"Verily, Allah is the Knower of the unseen of the heavens and the earth. Surely, He is All-Knower of the contents of the chests"
