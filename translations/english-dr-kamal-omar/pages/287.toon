quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  17,50,"Say: “Become, you people, stones or iron"
  17,51,"or some created thing out of that which gives a feeling of ‘hard’ and ‘great’ (to your mind) in your chests.” Then soon will they say: “Who shall bring us back (to life)?” Say: “He Who created you for the first time!” Then they will nod their heads at you and will say: “When (will that (be)?” Say: “Perhaps, that, it becomes very close"
  17,52,"The Day He calls you, then you will respond with His Praise (forgetting all arrogance and disobedience) and you will think you did not stay (in the world) but very little"
  17,53,"And say to My Ibad that they may utter which is better (and tender). Surely, the Satan sows disagreements and dissensions amongst them. Certainly, the Satan is an evident enemy to mankind"
  17,54,"Your Nourisher-Sustainer knows you better; if He thinks proper He will bestow mercy on you, or if He thinks proper He will submit you to punishment. And We have not sent you as a wakil over them"
  17,55,"And your Nourisher-Sustainer knows more about that who is in the heavens and the earth. And surely, indeed We have preferred some Prophets over some others. And we gave Zabur to Daud"
  17,56,"Say: “Call those whom you boasted as ‘authorities’ besides Him. So (you will feel) they have neither power to remove adversity from you nor to shift (it from you).”"
  17,57,"Those whom people call upon (as deities, partners in Allah’s Dominion or as intercessors) seek and desire Al-Wasilah (means of access) to their Nourisher-Sustainer as to who of them becomes nearer (to Him) and they hope for His mercy and they fear His punishment. Verily, the punishment coming from your Nourisher-Sustainer is something against which preventive steps must be taken"
  17,58,And there is not a habitation but We are Destroyer unto it before the Day of Resurrection or Bringer of punishment unto it — a punishment very severe. This stands (written) in straight lines in Al-Kitab
