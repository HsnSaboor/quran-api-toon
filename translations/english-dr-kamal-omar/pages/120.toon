quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,71,"And they assessed that (there) will be no Fitnah, so they became blind and they became deaf; afterwards Allah turned to them (with Forgiveness); yet again they became blind and they became deaf — a vast majority of them. And Allah is All-Seer of what they do"
  5,72,"Surely, have disbelieved those who said: “Certainly Allah is He (who is) Al-Maseeh, Ibn-o-Maryam.” And Al-Maseeh said: “O Bani Israiel! Pay obedience to Allah, Nourisher-Sustainer to me and Nourisher-Sustainer to you. Certainly it (is that) whosoever sets up partners with Allah, then certainly Allah has forbidden for him the Paradise and his abode is the Fire. And for the Zalimun there is not (any one) out of the helpers"
  5,73,"Surely, have disbelieved those who said: “Verily, Allah is the third of the three (in the concept of Trinity).” And there is no (one) out of (the status of) an ilah except One Ilah. And if they cease not from what they utter, verily, will befall those who have disbelieved out of them — a punishment most painful"
  5,74,"Will they then not repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"
  5,75,"Al-Maseeh, Ibn-o-Maryam is none but a Messenger. Definitely went before him (many) Messengers while his mother (had been) a Siddiqah. They both used to eat food (which is essential to sustain a human being physically). Look how We explain to them the proofs, yet look how they indulge in falsehood"
  5,76,"Say: “Do you worship besides Allah that who does not (at all) possess for you harm and nor a benefit?” And Allah: He is the All-Hearer, All-Knower"
