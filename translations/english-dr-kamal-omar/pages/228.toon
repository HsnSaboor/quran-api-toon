quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,54,"We do not say, except that some of our deities have approached you with an evil touch.” (Hud) said: “I make Allah as the Witness, and I give evidence that I am free from that which you ascribe as partners (in the Dominion of Allah)"
  11,55,"besides Him. So plot against me altogether, then allow me no respite"
  11,56,"I have put my trust in Allah, my Nourisher-Sustainer, and your Nourisher-Sustainer. (There is) not out of a living/moving creature but He is the One Who holds in firm control her forelock. Certainly, my Nourisher-Sustainer commends the Permanent Path"
  11,57,"So if you turn away, so without any doubt I have conveyed you (the Message) that I have been sent therewith to you. And my Nourisher-Sustainer will bring as successors a nation other than you, and you will not harm Him in the least. Surely, my Nourisher-Sustainer is All-Protector over all things"
  11,58,"And as and when Our Command came, We saved Hud and those who Believed with him in mercy proceeding from Us and We rescued them from a severe torment"
  11,59,And these (were) ’Ad. They showed arrogance against the Ayaat of their Nourisher-Sustainer and they disobeyed His Messengers and followed the command of every oppressor deeply enemical (to the ordainments of Allah)
  11,60,"And they were made attached to a curse in this world as well as on the Day of Resurrection. Behold! Verily, ’Ad disbelieved in their Nourisher-Sustainer. Beware! Barrier (to mercy) for ’Ad, the nation of Hud"
  11,61,"And to Samud (the word refers to a particular Arab nation) their brother Salih (was sent as a Messenger). He said: “O my nation! Pay obedience to Allah. (There is) not for you out of a god other than Him. He brought you forth from the earth and settled you therein; then ask forgiveness of Him, then turn to Him in repentance. Certainly, my Nourisher-Sustainer is Near (to all by His love), Responsive.”"
  11,62,"They said: “O Salih! Indeed, you have been amongst us a symbol of hope till before this. Do you (now) forbid us that we obey what our fathers (ancestors) pay obedience to? And surely we, indeed, are in grave doubt about that which you invite us to.”"
