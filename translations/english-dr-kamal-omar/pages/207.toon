  9,125,"And as for those in whose hearts is a disease (in the form of doubt, suspicion, hypocrisy or disbelief) then it increased them in filth, in addition to their filth (they are already involved in), and they (even) died while they (were) disbelievers"

  9,129,"So if they turned away, then declare: “Allah became sufficient to me. La-ilaha-illa-Huwa; in Him I have put my trust and He is the Nourisher-Sustainer of the Mighty Throne.”"
