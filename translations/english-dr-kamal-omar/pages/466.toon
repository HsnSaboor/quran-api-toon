  39,71,"And those who disbelieved have been driven to Hell in groups, till when they reached it, its doors were opened, and its keepers (or guards) said to them: “Didn’t the Messengers come to you from amongst you — they reproduce before you the Verses of your Nourisher-Sustainer, and they give you warning about meeting this Day of yours?” They said (in reply): “Of course, true!” And, but the statement about punishment stands implemented against the disbelievers"
  39,72,"It has been said (to them): “Enter you the gates of Hell as abiders therein.” So evil is the abode of the arrogant (and defiant) ones"

  39,74,"And they said: “Selective Praise suits Allah (Alone) Who has fulfilled to us His Promise and has made us inherit (this) land (in Paradise).

How excellent a reward for those who act [in submission to Al-Kitab, and adopt Sirat-e-Mu’staqim (the Permanent Path) described therein]!”"
