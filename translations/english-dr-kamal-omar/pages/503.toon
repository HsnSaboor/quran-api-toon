  46,6,"And when mankind are assembled (on the Day of Resurrection), they (i.e., the false gods) became enemies unto them (who used to invoke them), and became deniers regarding their own worship (at the hands) of these people"

  46,8,"Do they say he has forged it? Say: “If I have fabricated (or forged) it, then you have no power for (supporting) me against Allah — in any way.

  46,9,"Say: “I am not something unique out of the Messengers; and I do not perceive what will be done with me and nor (I do perceive what will be done) with you people. I do not obey except what has been revealed unto me. And I am not except a plain warner.”"
  46,10,"Say: “Have you (ever) pondered, if it is proceeding from Allah and you disbelieved it — while a witness from amongst Bani Israiel gave testimony in favour of something identical to it, so he developed Faith, while you became arrogant?” Verily, Allah does not guide the nation of transgressors"
