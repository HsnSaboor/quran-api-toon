  4,66,"And if We had ordained for them: ‘that you kill yourselves (in the Way of Allah), or (that) you come out of your homes (in the Way of Allah)’, they would not have done it except a minority among them. And if indeed they had done what they are exhorted to, surely it would have been better for them and more powerful in providing strength (to their Faith or Belief)"
