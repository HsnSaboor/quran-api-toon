  25,7,"And they said: “What (has gone wrong) with this Messenger? He eats food and walks on the roads. Why not an angel has been sent down unto him so that he becomes a warner alongwith him"

  25,9,"See how they have brought forth for you similitudes, so they have gone astray, so they have no capacity (to find out the) Path"
