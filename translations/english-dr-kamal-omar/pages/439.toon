quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  35,39,"He it is Who made you successors (generations after generations) in the earth. So whosoever disbelieved, on him will be (the bad effect of) his disbelief. And the disbelief of the disbelievers will not add (anything) before their Nourisher-Sustainer, except anger. And the disbelief of the disbelievers will not add (any thing) except loss"

And you never find for the Sunnah of Allah, any Tahveel (reverting back to something initially practiced, then suspended or rejected)"
  35,44,"Have they then not travelled through the earth, so they may see what was the final-end of those (who went) before them, and they were superior than them in power? And Allah is not (such) that may frustrate Him anything in the heavens and or in the earth. Verily, He is All-Knowing, All-Capable"
