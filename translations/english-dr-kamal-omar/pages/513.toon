quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  48,16,"Say to those who lagged behind out of the bedouins: “Soon you shall be called upon to a nation given to great warfare. They shall either fight you in an armed encounter, or they shall seek peace (with you). So if you pay obedience Allah will pay you a fair reward; and if you turned away as you have turned back on previous occasion, He will put you to punishment — of a painful torment.”"
  48,17,"No blame (is applicable) to that who is blind, and nor there is blame upon that who is lame, and nor there is blame on one who is down with sickness (if they did not volunteer themselves for Qital,). And whosoever obeys Allah and the Messenger, He will admit him to Gardens, flow underneath them rivers. And whoever will turn back, He will punish him with a painful torment"
  48,18,"Surely, indeed Allah gave His assent to the Believers when they swear a pledge to you under the tree. So He knew what is in their hearts, so He made to descend As-Sakinah (calmness and tranquility) over them and He rewarded them an immediate success"
  48,19,"As far as abundant spoils of war (are concerned) they will pick it up in future. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise"
  48,20,"Allah has given you a promise regarding abundant spoils of war; you will receive it (in some coming encounter); so He has hastened for you this (immediate success) and He has restrained the hands of (the enemical) people from you (through a treaty of peace signed within the belly of Makka. See Verse No. 24). And (this He appreciated) so that it (i.e., the signing of a peace treaty to overcome adverse conditions and periods) becomes a Sign for the Believers; and in order that He may guide you to Siratam Mustaqim"
  48,21,"And the later one, you have definitely not made an assessment thereof, surely Allah has compassed it — and Allah is All-Capable over every thing"
  48,22,"And if would have fought against you those who have disbelieved they certainly would have turned (their) backs (in spite of being greater in numbers), then they will not find a wali and nor a helper"
  48,23,That had been the Sunnah of Allah which definitely continued and persisted since before. And you will never find a change for the Sunnah (Practice) of Allah
