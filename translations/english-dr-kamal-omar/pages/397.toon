quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  29,7,"And those who have Believed and performed righteous deeds, surely We shall write off from them their evil deeds, and We shall indeed reward them better than what they used to do"
  29,8,"And We have enjoined on (every) human being (to remain) good and dutiful to his parents. And if the twain made efforts on you that you commit shirk regarding Me — about that you have no knowledge, so do not obey those two. Unto Me is your returning place, so I shall tell you about what you used to do"
  29,9,"And those who have Believed and have performed righteous deeds, We shall surely admit them among the righteous people"
  29,10,"And of mankind (is that) who says: “We have Believed in Allah,” then when he was made to suffer ‘in (the Cause of) Allah’, he regarded the test and trial at the hands of humans like a punishment from Allah. And surely, if there came assistance from your Nourisher-Sustainer (leading to a Muslim victory), surely (the hypocrites will immediately) say: “Verily, we have remained alongwith you (Muslims)!” Is then not Allah more aware of what is in the chests of the worlds"
  29,11,"And surely Allah will make known those who have accepted Faith, and surely He will make known the hypocrites"
  29,12,"And those who have disbelieved said regarding those who have accepted Faith: “Follow our way of life and we shall surely bear the burden of your sins,” although they are not the bearer of burdens of any thing of their sins. Surely, they are indeed liars"
  29,13,"And surely, they will bear their own burdens and burdens (of those whom they misled) alongwith their own burdens; and indeed they would be put to questioning on (the) Day of the Hereafter about what they used to forge (as falsehoods)"
  29,14,"And truly, indeed We sent Nuh to his nation, so he stayed among them a thousand years less (by only) fifty years; then the Deluge overtook them while they were transgressors"
