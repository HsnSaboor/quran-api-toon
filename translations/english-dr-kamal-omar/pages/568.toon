quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,"So (there is) not for him, this Day over-here a sincere and devoted friend"
  69,36,and nor food except out of the washings
  69,37,Drink it not except the sinners
  69,38,So beware! I do call to witness what you see
  69,39,and what you see not
  69,40,Certainly this (Al-Qur‘an or Al-Kitab) is indeed Qawl-o-Rasulin Karim (Utterance of an honoured Messenger)
  69,41,And it is not (the) word of a poet; little is that you Believe
  69,42,And nor (is it) the word of a clairvoyant; little (is that) which you remind (yourself and others)
  69,43,(This is) a Descent proceeding from Nourisher-Sustainer of the worlds
  69,44,"And if he had uttered some of the sayings relating these to Us (i.e., mahead of state these narrations binding for the Believers) —"
  69,45,"(then) surely, We would have seized him with (his) right (side)"
  69,46,"(and) afterwards, surely We would have cut off from him (his) life-artery"
  69,47,Then (There would have been) not any one out of you as those who become an obstruction against that (punishment)
  69,48,"And without doubt this (Al-Kitab is) indeed, (the only) Tazkiratun-lil-Muttaqin (‘Reminder for the righteous)"
  69,49,"And verily We, indeed We know that amongst you (are) those who deny (this status for Allah’s Scripture)"
  69,50,And undoubtedly it certainly (is a source of) disappointment for the disbelievers
  69,51,"And surely, it is indeed Haqq-ul-Yaqin (‘A certain Truth’)"
  69,52,"So glorify the name of your Nourisher-Sustainer, the Most High"
  70,1,A questioner asked concerning a torment about to befall —
  70,2,"upon the disbelievers, (there is) not, unto it one who can avert (it) —"
  70,3,"(since it is coming) from Allah, controller of the ascents"
  70,4,The angels and the Ar-Ruh ascend to Him in an aeon the measure whereof is fifty thousand years
  70,5,So have patience — a beautiful patience
  70,6,"Verily, they see it (i.e., the torment about to befall) as something extremely remote"
  70,7,while We see it very near
  70,8,The Day the sky becomes like the superficial flim of boiling oil
  70,9,and the mountains become like flakes of wool
  70,10,and does not ask a deeply devoted friend for (his) deeply devoted friend
