quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,98,"Then why there went not any habitation that might have Believed, (and) then her Faith might have benefited her — except the nation of Yunus. As they accepted Faith, We removed from them the torment of disgrace in the life of this world and We provided them all provisions for a while"
  10,99,"And if had willed your Nourisher-Sustainer, would have Believed whoever is on the earth, all of them enmasse. Then, would you compel mankind until they become Believers"
  10,100,And it is not (possible) for any Nafs that she may develop Faith except by the permission of Allah. And He places Rijs on those who do not use sense
  10,101,"Say: “Ponder and think what is that which is in the heavens and the earth. And the Signs and warnings do not benefit a nation who do not Believe"
  10,102,"Then do they wait except like the days of those who passed away before them? Say: “So, wait, I am too, with you, among those who wait.”"
  10,103,"Then (at the critical moment) We save Our Messengers and those who have Believed. In this way, it is incumbent upon Us: We provide a safe passage to the Believers"
  10,104,"Say: “O you mankind! If you are in doubt as to my Religion, then (know that) I do not obey those whom you worship besides Allah. But I pay obedience to Allah Who causes you to die and I am commanded that I may become out of the Believers"
  10,105,"and that: set your face (devote full attention) to the Unitarian Religion and be not out of the Mushrikun"
  10,106,"and invoke not besides Allah that who gives not benefit to you and gives not harm to you. So if you did, then surely you, in such a situation, are from the transgressors"
