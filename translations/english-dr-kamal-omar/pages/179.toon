quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  8,17,"So you people killed them not. And, but Allah (Himself) killed them. And you did not shoot when you did shoot (from your arrows and other armaments.); and, but Allah (Himself) shot (at them) that He might test the Believers of His Own (in) a fair trial. Verily, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower"
  8,18,"This to you (is a reminder), surely Allah: (He is the) One Who weakens the deceitful plot of the disbelievers"
  8,19,"(O disbelievers) if you ask for a judgment, then surely the judgment has reached you. And if you cease (your armed encounter with the Believing military forces), then it will be better for you; and if you counter-attack, We shall (definitely) retaliate and your group shall avail nothing to you even though it became overwhelmingly large. And (be careful) that Allah is with the Believers"
  8,20,"O you people who have Believed! Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn from him while you are listening (him in some talk, discussion, advice or counselling)"
  8,21,"And be not like those who said: “We have heard,” although they: they do not listen"
  8,22,"Verily, the worst of the moving/living creatures in the Sight of Allah are the deaf, (and) the dumb, those who do not use intellect"
  8,23,"And had Allah known in them (any) good, indeed He would have made them listen. And (even) if He had made them listen, surely, they would have turned away, and they are those who stay away (from the Statements of Al-Kitab)"
  8,24,"O you who have Believed! Respond to Allah and to the Messenger when He called you to that which shall give you life (and shall revive you from a spiritually dead condition), and know that Allah comes in between a person and his heart (to warn him against evil whispering from Satan and to turn him towards a just initiative). And verily, He (it is): to Him you (all) shall be gathered"
  8,25,"And guard against the Fitnah which affects not exclusively those of you who transgressed, and beware that Allah is very Strict in retribution"
