quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Say: “What thing is greater in testimony?” Say: “Allah is Witness between me and between you, and this Al-Quran has been made evident on me that I may warn you therewith and whomsoever it has (already) reached. Do you, with surety, must bear witness that alongwith Allah there are other ’aaliha (gods)?” Say: “I do not bear witness (to this falsehood)!” Say: “Definitely, what is a fact is that He is the only One Ilah (God). And truly I am absolved of what you indulge with in polytheism"
  6,20,"Those whom We have given Al-Kitab recognise it (i.e., the original version of the Book as being propagated by the Last Prophet) as they recognise their own children. Those who have damaged their selves: so they will not Believe"
  6,21,And who is more wrong-doer than one who invented against Allah (evident) falsehood or belied His Ayaat? Certainly it is that the transgressors do not attain success
  6,22,"And the Day We shall gather them all together; afterwards We shall say to those who joined partners (in worship with Us): “Where are partners assigned by you — those whom you used to assert (as partners in the dominion of Allah)?”"
  6,23,"Thereafter there remains no excuse (or argument) from them except that they said: “By Allah, Our Nourisher-Sustainer, we were not polytheists.”"
  6,24,Look! How they lied against themselves; and disappeared from them what they had been falsely inventing
  6,25,"And out of them is that who listens to you; and We have set over their hearts a covering that they may understand it (naught) and in their ears, a cork. And if they see every one of the Ayaat (collectively shown to them from Al-Kitab on one particular subject) they will not Believe therein to the point (that) when they came to you they argue with you. The people who have disbelieved say: “(It is) nothing but the writings of the earlier people.”"
  6,26,"And they prevent (others) from it, while (themselves) they keep away from it. And they destroy not but their ownselves, yet they perceive (it) not"
  6,27,"And if you saw when they were set over the Fire, then they said: “Would that be for us that we are sent back to the earth and we do not deny the Ayaat of our Nourisher-Sustainer and we become out of the Believers?”"
