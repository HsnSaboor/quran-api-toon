quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,109,"And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And to Allah, matters are returned (for decision)"
  3,110,You are the best ummah raised up for mankind. You shall enjoin Al-Ma’ruf and you shall forbid against Al-Munkar; and you shall Believe in Allah. And had the people of Al-Kitab Believed (in Al-Kitab) it would have been better for them. Among them are Believers but most of them are Al-Fasiqun
  3,111,"They will definitely do you no harm, barring an injury; and if they battle against you, they will run away from you on their backs, then they will not receive (any) assistance (against you)"
  3,112,"They are smitten with vileness wheresoever they are found, except (when) under a covenant from Allah and a covenant from men. And they have drawn (on themselves) the wrath of Allah, and they are smitten with indignity. This (engulfed them) because they had been rejecting the Ayaat of Allah and had been assassinating the Prophets (in personality) without right. This is because they disobeyed and used to transgress (the limits, set by Allah)"
  3,113,"They (are) not (all) alike. Out of the people of Al-Kitab (exists) a group of upright people: ‘they recite the Ayaat of Allah during the hours of night and they, they make prostrations (while in Prayer)"
  3,114,"They Believe in Allah and the Last Day and they enjoin Al-Ma’ruf and forbid against Al-Munkar, and they hasten in Al-Khairat (ideal actions and good works) and they are out of the righteous"
  3,115,"And whatever they do out of good: so (it) shall not be denied unto them; and Allah is All-Aware of Al-Muttaqun"
