quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  76,6,"(its source being) a spring: Ibad of Allah shall have a drink thereof; they will make it gush forth — flowing with full force"
  76,7,"They (had been such people who) implement (their) vows, and they fear a Day whose evil (would be) widespread"
  76,8,"and they provide the food, out of love and regard for Him to the indigent, and orphan or weak and a captive"
  76,9,"(saying): “Surely, what (is a fact is that) we feed you for the attention and pleasure of Allah. We do not wish from you anything in exchange as a reward, and nor thanks"
  76,10,"Verily, we fear from our Nourisher-Sustainer a Day extremely distressful, tremendously horrible.”"
  76,11,So Allah saved them from the evil of that Day and He provided them cheerfulness and joy
  76,12,And their reward because of that which they bore in patience (would be) Garden and (raiments of) silk
  76,13,"Reclining ones therein on sofas. They shall not experience therein (the presence of the) sun, and nor excessive or bitter cold"
  76,14,And the shades thereof (are as if) coming down over them; and the clusters (of fruits) thereof have been made to come down (over them) to an extreme lowering
  76,15,And repeatedly will be passed over them vessels (and jugs made) of silver and cups (which) appeared (like) crystals
  76,16,crystals of silver. They took a measure of it measuring (it as they desired)
  76,17,And they would be made to drink therein a cup whose one component came to be ginger
  76,18,A spring therein (fills this cup). It has been allotted the name Salsabil
  76,19,And will move all around them boys (of everlasting youthful freshness). When you noticed them you assessed them scattered pearls
  76,20,"And when you noticed, then and there, you noticed delights and a tremendous dominion"
  76,21,"Over them, overgarments of Sundus (fine silk) and Istabraq (brocade). And they would be adorned with bracelets of silver; and their Nourisher-Sustainer made them drink a purified, sanctified drink"
  76,22,"(They will be told): “Truly, this became unto you a reward, and your endeavour stands appreciated and fully thanked.”"
  76,23,"Verily We, We, We have sent down unto you Al-Quran descending gradually (in portions, and after intervals)"
  76,24,So be steadfast regarding Hukm (‘Ordainment’) of your Nourisher-Sustainer; and do not obey among them a sinner or a disbeliever
  76,25,And remind (yourself and remind others) the Name of your Nourisher-Sustainer (in the) morning and the late-afternoon (in your Fajr and Asr Prayers)
