quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,"So, would not benefit them the intercession of the intercessors"
  74,49,Then what (is wrong) with them — from At-Tazkirah (‘The Admonition’.) they are those who remain at a distance
  74,50,As if they (are) frightened donkeys
  74,51,who have fled (out of fear) from a group of lions
  74,52,Nay! Every man of them desires that he may be given Suhuf (booklets) Munashsharah (spread out)
  74,53,"By no means! Nay, they are not mindful of the Hereafter"
  74,54,By no means (it benefits them)! Surely this is Tazkirah
  74,55,So whosoever desired he reminded it (to himself and to others)
  74,56,They will not remind (their ownselves or others) except that Allah desires (this). He (Alone is) worthy of (receiving) obedience and worthy for (granting) Forgiveness
  75,1,Nay! I bring as witness the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,"And, Nay! I bring to witness the self-censuring Nafs (self)"
  75,3,Does a human being assess that We shall never assemble his bones
  75,4,"Of course, (We are) Capable Ones over (this) that We align perfectly (even) his finger-tips"
  75,5,"Of course, a human being intends that he may commit sins prior to that (Day of Resurrection)"
  75,6,"(That is why) he asks: “When (will be this) Day of Resurrection"
  75,7,"So, when the sight is dazed"
  75,8,and the moon went in eclipse
  75,9,and the sun and the moon got joined to one another; (or got withdrawn from their orbits)
  75,10,"that Day the human being will say: “Where is the place of escape and then refuge"
  75,11,"By no means! (Today, there is) no place of hiding or refuge"
  75,12,"Towards your Nourisher-Sustainer, this Day, (is) the place of stay"
  75,13,"On that Day, the human being would be informed about what he sent forward, and what he left behind"
  75,14,Nay! The human being is a watch over his own Nafs
  75,15,even if he put forward his excuses (regarding ignorance of the law of God)
  75,16,Move not your tongue with it that you may make haste in memorising it (while this Al-Kitab is being inspired unto you)
  75,17,"Surely, on Us is the duty for its collection and its recitation"
  75,18,"so when We have recited it, then adopt its recitation"
  75,19,"Further on, indeed, on Us (is to provide) its explanation (within its Text)"
