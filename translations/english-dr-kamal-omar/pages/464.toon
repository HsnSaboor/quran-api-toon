quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  39,48,"And have started for them the evils which they earned (during their worldly life). And that very torment which they used to mock at, has extended all around them (and they stand encircled as criminal prisoners)"
  39,49,"So when harm touched a human being, he invoked Us. Afterwards when We bestowed on him grace from Us, he said: “Surely, what (is a fact is that) I have been given that because of (my) knowledge and learning.” Nay, (it is) a trial, but the majority of those people do not know"
  39,50,"Verily, those before them (also) said it (the same way), yet availed them not what they used to earn"
  39,51,"So the evil effects of what they earned reached them. And those who have transgressed from amongst these (contemporary people): soon shall reach them the evil effects of what they earned. And they shall not be those who could ever frustrate (Allah in His Plans)"
  39,52,"Do they not then know that Allah enlarges the provision for whom He thinks proper and (also) restricts (it to needs as and when He thinks proper)? Surely, in this are indeed signs for a nation who Believe"
  39,53,"Say: “O Ibadi (My obedient subjects) who have committed excesses against their own selves; despair not of the Mercy of Allah. Surely Allah forgives (and writes off) the sins — all (of them, when done out of ignorance or during a period devoid of admonitions and reminders or under any pressures). Surely He, He is the Oft-Forgiving, the continuously Merciful"
  39,54,And take a turn towards your Nourisher-Sustainer (for accepting and adopting the teachings in His Al-Kitab) and submit to Him before (a stage) that the torment comes to you; then you will not be helped
  39,55,And follow the better one of that which has been sent down to you from your Nourisher-Sustainer before (the stage) that the torment comes on you out of a sudden while you perceive (it) not —
  39,56,"lest a Nafs may say: “O alas! For what I derelicted in the link with Allah, and that I happened to be, indeed, out of those who mock and scoff (on every thing which is Islam or Faith).”"
