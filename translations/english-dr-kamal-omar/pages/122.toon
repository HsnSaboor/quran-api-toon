quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"And when they listened what has been sent down to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflow with tears because what they recognised of Al-Haqq. They say: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer! We have Believed. So record ourselves alongwith the Witnesses"
  5,84,"And what is for us (that) we may not Believe in Allah, and what came to us from Al-Haqq, and we wish that our Nourisher-Sustainer will admit us (to Paradise) along with the nation of righteous individuals.”"
  5,85,"So Allah rewarded them, because of what they said, Gardens — flow underneath them rivers. (They will be) dwellers therein. And this is the reward for Al-Muhsinun"
  5,86,"And those who disbelieved and belied Our Ayaat, they are companions of the Hell-Fire"
  5,87,"O you people who have Believed! Do not make unlawful the Tayyibat what Allah has made lawful to you, and do not transgress. Verily, Allah does not like the transgressors"
  5,88,"And do eat out of that which Allah provided as providence for you (declaring it) lawful (and) palatable. And pay obedience to Allah Whom you are: in Him, Believers"
  5,89,"Allah will not make you accountable for (what is) unintentional in your oaths, but He will make you accountable what you committed deliberate (in your) oaths. (If you break such an oath) then its expiation (would be) feeding ten poor persons out of the average what you feed your own family-members; or providing them garments; or (drafting) a document for (providing freedom to) one (human) neck (which is in slavery). But whosoever does not find (himself in a position to pay such an expiation) then (he shall keep) fasts for three days. This is the expiation for your oaths when you have sworn. But it shall be better if you protect your oaths (provided they are not undesirable). Thus Allah explains to you His Ayaat so that you may be grateful"
