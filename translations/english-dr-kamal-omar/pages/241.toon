quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  12,44,"They said: “Disturbing thoughts, wild imaginations; and we are not experts in the interpretation of wild disturbing imagination (appearing as dreams or visions).”"
  12,45,"And that one who was released out of those (prisoners) said as he recalled after a long time: “I will tell you about its interpretation, so let me go (for the purpose).”"
  12,46,"(The released prisoner approached the prison and there he said): ''Yusuf! O you, the highly truthful! Interpret for us in (the matter of a dream experienced by the head of state)- seven hefty cows whom the seven lean ones devour, and seven green ears (of corn) and (seven) others dry, that I may return to (our ruling) people, so that they may know (the hidden indication in the dream).”"
  12,47,"(Yusuf) said: “You shall sow seven years as usual, then what ever you harvested, so leave it in ears except a small portion from which you may eat"
  12,48,Then will come after this seven very hard (years) which will devour what you have saved in advance for them except a very small portion of what you will store
  12,49,Thereafter will come a year in which people will get abundant rain and in it they will extract oils.”
  12,50,"And Al-Malik (the head of state of Egypt,) said, “Come to me with him.” So as the rasul (messenger) came to him (i.e., to Yusuf), he (i.e., Yusuf) said:: “Return to your master-lord then ask him, ‘What is the position of the women who cut their hands. Surely, my Rabb (Nourisher-Sustainer) is Well-Aware of their stratagem’.”"
  12,51,"(Al-Malik asked the women who were involved in the plot and) said: “What (was) the matter with you when you ladies seduced Yusuf against his inclination?” The ladies said: “He kept away (from sin) for (fear of) Allah. We did not mark in him any evil.” The wife of Al-Aziz said: “Now has the truth come to light. I seduced him against his inclination, and surely, he is indeed of those who speak the truth"
  12,52,"This I say, so that he (i.e.,Yusuf) comes to know that I have not betrayed him in absence (as he is still staying in the prison of his own), and that Allah fulfils not the plot of the betrayers"
