quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,The heaven and At-Tariq ('The strictly adhering to a set path') act as a witness (to Allah’s Majesty)
  86,2,And what made you realise what At-Tariq is
  86,3,(It is) a star of piercing brightness
  86,4,There is no (human) Nafs but over her is a protector
  86,5,So let the human being ponder from what he has been created
  86,6,He is created from a fluid ejecting itself swiftly
  86,7,it proceeds from between back-bones and the ribs (since it is here where the source initially resides)
  86,8,"Surely, He is All-Capable over his revival (on the Day of Resurrection)"
  86,9,the Day when the secrets are subjected to Accountability
  86,10,Then there is not for him from any (power) and nor (any one) out of that who helps
  86,11,"The heaven possessing reemergence [of clouds and rains (is a witness, of the Majesty of its Creator]"
  86,12,"and the earth, possessor of the action of splitting-up"
  86,13,"Verily, this (Al-Kitab is) indeed a Qawlun Faslun"
  86,14,And it is not a senseless statement
  86,15,"Surely, they (i.e., the hypocrites and the disbelievers) plot a stratagem (against the propagation of Al-Kitab)"
  86,16,And I (also) plan a stratagem
  86,17,So give (some) respite to the disbelievers. Provide them a temporary respite
  87,1,"Glorify the Name of your Nourisher-Sustainer, the Higher (than all others) —"
  87,2,Who has created (every thing that exists) then set (it) in due proportion
  87,3,and Who assessed in measure (and) then guided (every creation to its way of life)
  87,4,and Who brought out the pasturage
  87,5,"(and) then made it dried and lifeless, brownish black (wet and decomposed)"
  87,6,"Soon, We shall teach you how to recite the correct pronunciation of the written (Arabic Text of Al-Kitab), then you shall not forget (it)"
  87,7,"except what Allah desired. [When Allah desires to put a person to a test regarding his Faith on al-ghaib (the unseen), He may withdraw the capacity to recite, or the capacity to keep in memory, or the capacity to bring to mind some particular portion of the Text of Al-Kitab. All control exists with Allah Alone]. Surely, He knows the apparent and whatever keeps (itself or himself) hidden"
  87,8,And We shall provide for you every facility for (reciting and propagating) Al-Yusrah
  87,9,So remind (to yourself and to others) if the Zikrah (‘Reminder’) gave benefit (to a personality)
  87,10,Soon receives (the) reminder — that who is mindful of the position (of Allah and fears Him)
  87,11,And the more arrogant one will remain unfamiliar to it
  87,12,"that, who enters the Great Fire"
  87,13,then he does not die therein and nor he lives. (It will be a struggle-state ‘between life and death’)
  87,14,"Indeed, he has achieved success who cleans and purifies (the Nafs)"
  87,15,and propagated the Name of his Nourisher-Sustainer; then (also) offered Prayer (as detailed in the Book of Allah)
