quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,28,"And if you avoid them seehead of state mercy (i.e., provisions) from your Nourisher-Sustainer — for which you do hope, then speak unto them a gentle word"
  17,29,"And keep not your hand tied to your neck (becoming a miser), and nor stretch it forth to (its) ultimate capacity, lest you become stuck-up — blamed one, full of sorrow"
  17,30,"Surely, your Nourisher-Sustainer enlarges the provision (beyond needs) for whom He thinks proper and straitens (according to needs for whom He thinks proper). Verily, He is All-Aware and All-Watcher regarding His Ibad"
  17,31,"And kill not your born (children) for fear of economic burden. We will provide sustenance to them and (also) to you. Surely, the killing of them (i.e., infanticide) is a monstrous error"
  17,32,"And come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a Fahisha (vulgar, obscene, immoral) and became evil as a way"
  17,33,"And do not kill any Nafs (person) that Allah has forbidden/protected, except under a just cause. And whoever is killed as a victim of transgression, then surely, We have given his heir the authority [to demand Qisas (providing the same punishment to one who commits crime), or to accept Diya (blood money), or to forgive)]. But he must not exceed limits in the matter of the murder. (i.e., he should not ask for punishment for any one but only the killer). Verily, he is insured [under protection and help (of the Divine law]"
  17,34,"And come not near the orphan’s property except with (an intention) that is better until he attains (the age of) his maturity. And fulfil the agreement (or contract). Verily, the agreement has remained subject to questioning and accountability"
  17,35,"And give full measure when you measured, and weigh (the items to the people) with a balance that maintains balance. This is advantageous and better for the ultimate result"
  17,36,"And do not commit that for which (there is) no knowledge with you. Verily, the hearing, the sight, and the heart — all of those are made ‘subject to questioning and accountability’ about that (commitment)"
  17,37,"And do not walk on the earth with conceit and arrogance. Verily, you would never rend and penetrate the earth, and you would never attain the stature like the mountains in height"
  17,38,All the bad aspects of these have been made hateful in the sight of your Nourisher-Sustainer
