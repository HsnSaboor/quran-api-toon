quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  25,12,"When it (i.e., the Hell) saw them from a place far and remote, they heard for it raging and roaring sound (emitting from inside it)"
  25,13,"And when they were thrown away from there to a narrow suffocating pocket, as chained (criminals), they cried then and there , (requesting) complete destruction"
  25,14,"Do not cry this Day for one single destruction, rather cry for repeated destructions"
  25,15,"Say: “Is this (torment) better or the Garden of Eternity which has been promised unto the righteous? It became theirs as a reward and (as a) destination"
  25,16,"For them (there will be) therein whatever they shall desire, abiders (therein), this has become a promise upon your Nourisher-Sustainer, prayed for (and perfectly answered)"
  25,17,"And the Day He gathers them and that what they worship besides Allah, then He will say: “Whether it is you? You misled Ibadi — all these, or they themselves strayed from the Path?”"
  25,18,"They said: “Glorified be You! It was not that it may suit us that we may pick up auliya besides You; but You bestowed on them and their fathers (provisions much beyond their needs) till they forgot Az-Zikr (‘The Message’) and became a nation completely doomed"
  25,19,"So, surely they gave you a lie regarding what you say. So (now) you have no capacity to avert (the punishment) and nor (you can seek) help. And whoever will transgress amongst you, We shall make him taste a great punishment"
  25,20,"And We did not send before you, out of Messengers, but verily, they eat food and they walk on the roads. And We have made some of you as a test and trial for some (others). Will you have patience? And your Nourisher-Sustainer is Ever All-Seer"
