quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"Those who devour Riba (usury) will not stand except as stands that whom the Satan by (his) touch makes devoid of intelligence. This is because they said: “Indeed! Even trade is similar to Riba.” Although Allah has permitted trade and has prohibited Riba. Then, to whom the Admonition came from his Nourisher-Sustainer and he desisted, then is (for and) to him whatever is past and his case (goes) to Allah (for decision). And one who repeated, then those are dwellers of Fire, they will reside therein"
  2,276,"Allah will destroy Riba and will increase in amount the Sadaqat. And Allah does not like all ungratefuls, sinners"
  2,277,"Certainly those who have Believed and have put up acts of righteousness and have established Salat and have paid off Zakat: for them, their reward is with their Nourisher-Sustainer. And no fear or apprehension would seize them; and they would not be down with depression and anxiety"
  2,278,O you people who have Believed! Pay obedience to Allah and give up what remains (unpaid to you) out of Riba if you happen to be Believers
  2,279,"And if you do not, then take notice of war from Allah and His Messenger. And if you agree to desist then for you is the original sum of your wealth. Neither you shall commit injustice, nor injustice would be done to you"
  2,280,"And if (the debtor) is in economic difficulties, then, respite (is his right) till he attains an easy state (to repay). And if you remit it by way of Sadaqa — it would be better for you if you have knowledge"
  2,281,"And guard against the Day wherein you shall be brought back to Allah: then shall every soul be paid justly whatever she earned (in her worldly life) and they shall not be dealt with unjustly"
