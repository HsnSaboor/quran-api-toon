quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  16,43,"And We sent not before you but (only) male-adults — We send inspirations to them: So ask Ahl-az-Zikr if you do not know"
  16,44,(And we sent them) with Al-Bayyinat and Az-Zubur. And We have delivered to you Az-Zikr that you may clearly explain to mankind whatever has been revealed towards them and in order that they may think over and ponder
  16,45,"Have they then felt secure who have plotted evils that Allah may cause the (piece of) earth sink along with them, or the punishment may come to them from the sites and directions they perceive not"
  16,46,Or He may get hold of them during their free movement? Then they will not be those who may create obstructions (for Allah’s plan) or may frustrate (His intentions)
  16,47,"Or He may get hold of them while (they are) in a state of fear (due to impending or approaching torment?). After all, surely, your Nourisher-Sustainer is indeed, full of kindness, continuously Merciful"
  16,48,"Have they not seen some of the things what Allah has created: their shadows incline to the right and to the left sides being submissive to Allah and they are subject to the laws (of Allah)"
  16,49,And to Allah submits whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth — out of the moving and living creatures and the angels. And they do not feel pride in arrogance
  16,50,They fear their Nourisher-Sustainer from over and above them and they do what they are commanded
  16,51,"And Allah directed: “Adopt not ilahain (two gods), ithnain (two in numbers).\" Certainly, what (is true is that) He is the only One Ilah (God), so only Me (you accept as God). So be conscious of Me with a feeling of fear (out of love and attachment)"
  16,52,And to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth and to Him belongs the permanently established Religion. Will you then pay obedience to (someone) other than Allah
  16,53,"And whatever is with you as a blessing, so (it is) from Allah. Afterwards when affliction (in poverty, disease or other problems) made you its victim, so to Him you cry (for help)"
  16,54,"Then when He removed the affliction from you, thereupon a group of people amongst you assign partners to their Nourisher-Sustainer"
