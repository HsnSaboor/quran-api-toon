quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  50,1,The Glorious Quran acts as a Witness
  50,2,"Nay! They have wondered that there has come to them a warner from amongst themselves. Then the disbelievers said: “This (Al-Kitab in the hands of this warner is) something strange"
  50,3,"Whether, when we are dead and we became dust (shall we be resurrected, as claimed in this Book)? That Return (to life, is something) very remote.”"
  50,4,"Surely, We knew how much of them the earth consumes, and with Us is a book (of records) which fully preserves (every thing)"
  50,5,Nay! They have belied Al-Haqq (‘The Truth’) when it reached them. So they are in a state of doubt and disagreement
  50,6,"Have they then not pondered towards the heaven above and over them how We have made it and adorned it, and there are not any of the flaws relating to it"
  50,7,"And the earth: We have spread it out, and We have impregnated therein mountains (standing firm and stable), and We have produced therein out of all kinds of lovely (growths) —"
  50,8,as a means of enlightenment and (as a) reminder for every Abd who repeatedly turns (to Allah)
  50,9,And We sent down from towards the sky cleansed and purified water; then We produced therewith orchards and grains of harvests
  50,10,"and date-palm tree, tall and stately; for it is a spathe in ranged clusters (piled one above the other) —"
  50,11,"as a provision for Ibad, and We revived therewith a dead habitation; in this manner (would be) the resurrection"
  50,12,"Before them did deny the nation of Nuh, and the dwellers of Rass, and (the) Samud"
  50,13,"and (the) ’Ad, and Firaun and the brethren of Lout"
  50,14,and the dwellers of Aika and the nation of Tubba. All these (groups) denied the Messengers; so My warning (about the torment) proved true
  50,15,"Did We then become tired with the first creation? Nay, they are in (a state of) despair against the new creation (in Resurrection)"
