  28,86,"And you were not expecting that Al-Kitab would be delivered to you, but (it is) a mercy from your Nourisher-Sustainer. So you shall not become a supporter for the disbelievers"
  28,87,"And let (people) not turn you away from the Ayaat of Allah after they have been sent down to you. And invite to your Nourisher-Sustainer, and be not of Al-Mushrikun"
  28,88,"And invoke not alongwith Allah another ilah (god), La ilaha illa Huwa (No god except He). All things await death and extinction except His Being. For Him is the Decision (Ordainment, Order and Verdict), and to Him you shall be returned"
