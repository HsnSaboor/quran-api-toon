  15,1,L. R. These are the signs in Al-Kitâb and Qurânum Mobin
  15,2,"Frequently, those who have disbelieved, desire and wish — that they had been Muslims"
  15,3,"Leave them: they may eat and enjoy, and vain hope may beguile them, so very soon they will come to know (the reality in comparison to fantasy)"
  15,4,And we have not destroyed any of the town but (there is available) for it Kitâbun M‘auloomun
  15,5,No Ummah (Community) outstrips its appointed life-span and they do not remain existent beyond (that)
  15,6,"And they said: “O you that on whom Az-Zikr. has been delivered, you are surely a fanatic"
  15,7,"Why not you come to us with angels, if you happen to be out of those who speak the truth?”"
  15,8,We do not send down angels except under a rightful situation; and then they did not become those who are given respite
  15,9,"Surely, We, We, We sent down Az-Zikr (‘The Message’) and surely, We, for it are indeed Protectors"
  15,10,"And surely, indeed, We sent before you amongst the sects (those who brought change in the Permanent Religion of Islam) of the earlier people"
  15,11,And there comes not to them out of a Messenger but they used to ridicule him
  15,12,Thus do We let it (disbelief or breahead of state the religion into sects) enter into the hearts of the Mujrimûn
  15,13,"They would not Believe in this (Al-Kitab), and indeed the practices of the earlier people have gone forth (which resulted into their complete destruction)"
  15,14,And even if We opened to them a gate from the heaven and they were to continue ascending thereto
  15,15,"they would have surely said: “Our eyes have been dazzled. Nay, we are a people under effect of magic.”"
