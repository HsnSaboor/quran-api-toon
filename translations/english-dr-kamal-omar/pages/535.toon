quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,"Youthful lads, granted perpetual freshness shall move all around them—"
  56,18,"alongwith cups and jugs, and a glass (full) of a freely flowing (drink)"
  56,19,whereof they are not given aching of the head; and nor they go into intoxication
  56,20,And fruits out of that which they shall desire
  56,21,And the flesh of bird out of that which they crave for
  56,22,And Hurun Eeinun
  56,23,"like the shapes of the pearls, well preserved"
  56,24,as a reward for what they used to do
  56,25,"They shall not listen therein (any) Laghw (vain talk), nor anything sinful"
  56,26,"except (the) utterance: Salam! , Salam"
  56,27,"And the Rightists: what (is meant by) the Rightists"
  56,28,Under the thornless Lote-tree
  56,29,and clustered banana
  56,30,and extended shade
  56,31,and water-fall
  56,32,and fruit in abundance —
  56,33,"neither interrupted in supply (due to season), and nor prohibited (due to any side-effects on any one)"
  56,34,and carpets hanging (as decoration)
  56,35,"Verily We, We have created them (see Verse Nos. 22, 23) of special creation"
  56,36,so We made them chaste and youthful
  56,37,"polite, of identical age and nature —"
  56,38,for the Rightists
  56,39,a major portion from the initial ones
  56,40,and a major portion of the later ones
  56,41,"And the leftists: What (is meant by) the leftists"
  56,42,(The leftists shall suffer) in dry hot wind and boiling (water)
  56,43,and shadow of black smoke
  56,44,neither cool and nor palatable
  56,45,"Verily, they used to be before (this stage) — those who indulge in luxury"
  56,46,And they used to insist on extreme sin
  56,47,"And they used to say: “Whether, when we have died and we changed into dust and bones shall surely we be indeed those who stand resurrected"
  56,48,What? And our forefathers (too)?”
  56,49,"Say: “Surely, the earlier ones as well as the later ones —"
  56,50,indeed would be those who are assembled for an appointed time of (the) Well-known Day
