quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  29,24,"And there was not an answer from his nation except that they said: “Kill him or burn him,” but Allah saved him from the fire. Verily, in this are indeed Ayaat (signs) for a nation who Believe"
  29,25,"And (Ibrahim) said: “Certainly, what you have adopted besides Allah, (are nothing but just) idols. Attachment amongst you is restricted to the life of this world. Afterwards, on the Day of Resurrection, some of you would reject some (others), and some of you would invoke curse on some (others), and your abode will be the Fire. And (there is) not for you, out of (the) helpers.”"
  29,26,"So Lout accepted Faith because of him and said: “Certainly I become one who emigrates to my Nourisher-Sustainer. Certainly He: He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise"
  29,27,"And We bestowed on him Ishaque and Yaqub, and We retained the Prophethood and Al-Kitab in his progeny, and We granted him his due reward in this world. And surely he, in the Hereafter, is indeed, out of the righteous individuals"
  29,28,"And (remember) Lout when he said to his nation: “Surely you, indeed you come to Al-Fahishah; no one out of the worlds has preceded you people in this (perversion)"
  29,29,"Is it (that) certainly you people, indeed you, approach males and cut off the highway (to force men to submit to your lusts), and you practice abomination in your social clubs?” So there was not an answer from his nation except that they said: “Come to us with the torment of Allah if you are out of the truthful.”"
  29,30,"(Lout) said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Provide me assistance over the nation of Al-Mufsidun"
