quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  38,27,And We created not the heaven and the earth and whatever is between those two without purpose. That (happens to be the) view of those who have disbelieved. Then woe to those who have disbelieved — from the Fire (that awaits them)
  38,28,"Shall We treat those who have Believed (in the Book of Allah) and have done righteous deeds, like Mufsidun on the earth? Or shall We regard the Muttaqun (Pious and righteous), like the Fujjar"
  38,29,"A Book, which We have sent down to you, full of blessings: that the people may ponder over its Verses, and that people of understanding may remind themselves and remind others"
  38,30,"And to Daud We bestowed Sulaiman — how excellent an Abd! Surely, he (is) oft-returning (to Us, in repentance)"
  38,31,"When there were brought for review before him, in the later part of afternoon, As-Safinat (noblest breed, well trained) Al-Jiyad (horses, specially desired in the military)"
  38,32,"then he said: “Certainly, I have nurtured the love of something desirable in the interest of Zikr (Message) of my Nourisher-Sustainer,\" [Sulaiman reminded the people that he has special love for such horses, as they help and assist in establishing a state. Muslim soldiers mount on these horses to fight to establish and defend a Divine head of statedom] — until (these horses) went out of view"
  38,33,"(So great was his love for them that he said): “Bring them (horses) back to me.” Then he started moving his hand (to show love to the horses) over (their) calves and (their) necks"
  38,34,"And surely, indeed We put Sulaiman to test when We dropped on his chair Jasadan [a mere body (Sulaiman probably felt a sudden disappearance of physical power in his body and while trying to sit, he fell on the chair in semi-paralysed fashion. This could be to make him remind that all power, whether of the physical body or as head of a magnificent empire, proceeds from Allah,)] then (instead of blaming Allah) he turned (to Allah for forgiveness and mercy)"
  38,35,"(Sulaiman) said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Forgive me, and bestow upon me a head of statedom such as, shall not belong to any other after me. Verily You, You are the Real Bestower.”"
  38,36,So We regulated and controlled for him the wind. It does blow gently to his order wherever he went
  38,37,And (We regulated and controlled) the devils (out of jinns) — every kind of builder and diver
  38,38,"and (also) others, remaining in groups — in chains"
  38,39,"(Reminding Sulaiman We said): “This is Our gift, so spend or withhold without (fearing) to give an account"
  38,40,"And surely, for him, with Us (is) surely nearness, and excellence of abode"
  38,41,"And bring to mind Our Abd Ayyub when he called out to his Nourisher-Sustainer (saying) that: “The Satan has afflicted me with exhaustion and torture.”"
  38,42,"(We advised him): “Have a brisk walk with your leg. This is a washed out (i.e., filtered), cooling one, and a (health-restoring) drink"
