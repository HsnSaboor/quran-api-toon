quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  27,36,"So when (the messengers with the royal gift) came to Sulaiman, he said: “Will you provide me aid and assistance in the form of wealth and provisions? So, what Allah has given me is better than what He has given you. Nay, you rejoice in your gift"
  27,37,"Go back to them. Then verily, we shall come to them with (military) forces — there is no capacity with them (i.e., with the forces of Saba) for (facing) these (Muslim regiments). And we shall surely drive them out from this (land of Saba) in disgrace, and they (will be) those who have surrendered.”"
  27,38,"(Sulaiman now addressed the chiefs in his state and) said: “O you chiefs! Which of you comes to me with her throne prior to that they may come to me as Muslims?”"
  27,39,"An Ifrit (strong one) from the jinns said: “I will come to you with that before you rise from your sitting. And verily, I am, for this, indeed strong and trustworthy.”"
  27,40,"Said that with whom was knowledge from Al-Kitab : “I will come to you with it even earlier than ' the margin of your eyelid returns to you' (i.e., within the twinkling of an eye).\" So when he saw it placed before him, he said: \"This is by the Grace of my Nourisher-Sustainer so that He may test me whether I become grateful or I become ungrateful. And whoever pays thanks (to Allah, it is) for his own self, and whoever became ungrateful — then certainly my Nourisher-Sustainer is Free of all wants, Bountiful.”"
  27,41,"(Sulaiman) said: “Disguise and transform in her interest, her throne (by removing all signs and engravings that depict polytheism or disbelief). We shall see whether she receives guidance or she becomes of those who do not receive guidance.”"
  27,42,"So when she came, it was said (to her): \" Is this like your throne?” She said: “As though it is that very one. And Al-Ilm (‘The Knowledge’) has been delivered to us even before this and we have become Muslims.”"
  27,43,"And (Sulaiman’s effort) stopped her from that which she used to worship besides Allah. Surely, she used to be of a nation of disbelievers"
  27,44,"It was said to her: “Enter the palace.” But as she saw it, she assessed it to be a wide expanse of water running in waves and she tucked up (her clothes) off her both calves (so that she may cross it over gracefully). (Sulaiman) said: “Truly, it is a palace (underneath which runs a river, simulating the delights in Paradise) paved smooth with slab of crystal-clear glass. She said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Verily, I have wronged myself and I have accepted Islam in the presence of Sulaiman in complete devotion to Allah, the Nourisher-Sustainer to the worlds.”"
