quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  59,10,"And those who came (as refugees or emigrants) after these (initial emigrants), they will say: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Grant us Forgiveness and for our brethren who became foremost in Faith in comparison to us; and allow not in our hearts ill-feeling for those who have Believed. Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Surely You are Full of Kindness, continuously Merciful .”"

  59,14,"They do not indulge with you in Qital as a group, but inside fortified townships, or from behind walls. Their dissensions among themselves are severe. You assess them as united, but their hearts are divided. This is because they are a nation who do not use intellect"
  59,15,"Like the example of those who (passed) before them recently, they tasted the evil result of their behaviour, and for them (awaits) a painful torment"
  59,16,"Like the example of Satan when he said to mankind: “Disbelieve (in Allah).” But when (a certain human being) did disbelieve, he (i.e., the Satan) said: “Certainly, I stand absolved of you. Indeed I fear Allah, (the) Nourisher-Sustainer to the worlds"
