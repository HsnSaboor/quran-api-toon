quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  19,12,"O Yahya! Hold Al-Kitab with firmness. And We bestowed him decisive power while yet a child. [Note that Allah addresses Yahya directly by name. This style is again available in Verse 38/26 when Allah directly addresses Daud. No other Prophet is directly addressed in Al-Kitab by name. The permanent and eternal Manual for mankind, revealed in original to each and every Prophet of Allah has many characteristics specific to itself, not applicable to any other book or literature whatsoever]"
  19,13,And (made him) sympathetic (to men as a mercy or a grant) from Us and pure and sanctified (from sins) and he was deeply righteous
  19,14,and dutiful to his parents and he did not become an arrogant or disobedient (either to Allah or to his parents)
  19,15,"And Salamun (peace and security) on him the day he was born, the day he dies, and the day he will be raised up to life (in Resurrection)"
  19,16,And discuss Maryam through Al-Kitab — when she withdrew in seclusion from her family to a place facing east
  19,17,She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our Ruh (angel) and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects
  19,18,"She said: “Verily I, I seek refuge in Ar-Rahman from you if you are obedient (to Him).”"
  19,19,"(The angel) said: “Certainly, what (is the fact is that) I am a messenger from your Nourisher-Sustainer, so that I may bestow on you (on His behalf) a righteous son.”"
  19,20,"She said: “How can there be to me a son, when no man has touched me and I have not gone unchaste?”"
  19,21,"(The angel) said: “Thus has your Nourisher-Sustainer said: ‘That, to Me, is very easy: and that We may appoint him as a sign to mankind and a mercy from Us,' and the matter is already decreed (in the plan of Allah)"
  19,22,So she conceived him and she withdrew with him to a far place
  19,23,"And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of date-palm. She said: “Would that I had died before this, and had been out of sight (and) completely forgotten"
  19,24,"Then (the angel) called out to her from (a place much) lower down to her, (saying) that: “Grieve not! Surely, your Nourisher-Sustainer has provided underneath you a stream of running water"
  19,25,"And shake towards you the trunk of the date-palm: it (i.e., the tree) will let fall upon you freshly ripened dates. [Please note that the ripening month for the dates is June/July and not December]"
