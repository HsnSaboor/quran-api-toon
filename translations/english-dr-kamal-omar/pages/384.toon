  27,80,"Verily, you do not make the dead to hear, and you do not make the deaf to hear to the call, when they fled turning their backs"
  27,81,"And you (are) not (that) who guides the blind inspite of their persistence in ignorance and error. You do not make one hear (the Message) except that who Believes in Our Ayaat, so they are Muslims"
  27,82,"And when the Statement (about the final destruction of this world) got issued in their presence, We brought forth to them a Daabbah from within the earth; she will talk to them (to make them realise their state) because mankind believed not with certainty in Our Ayaat"

  27,87,"And (bring to mind) the Day when the siren will be blown, then became terrified whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth except that whom Allah thought proper (to keep him stay calm and satisfied). All came to Him as beings, conscious of their lowliness"
  27,88,"And you see the mountains and you think them solidly fixed; and they shall fly like the passing away of the clouds. (Such is the) artistry of Allah Who provided stability to all things. Verily, He is Well-Aware with what you do"
