quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,"When his Nourisher-Sustainer called out to him within the Sacred Valley, Tuwa"
  79,17,"(Allah directed him): “Proceed to Firaun! Certainly, he has transgressed beyond bounds"
  79,18,"Then say (to Firaun who thinks he is a god in himself): Is that (possible) for you (that you turn) towards (Allah) that you sanctify (yourself of disbelief, polytheism and transgression)"
  79,19,"And I (as a Prophet of Allah) shall guide you to your Nourisher-Sustainer, so you shall realise His Position.'”"
  79,20,Then (Musa) showed the great sign
  79,21,But (Firaun) belied and became arrogant
  79,22,"Then he about-turned: he moves (away) quickly"
  79,23,Then he gathered (his forces and people) and loudly declared
  79,24,"Then he said: “I am rabb unto you (all), the higher one!”"
  79,25,"So Allah seized him in a severe punishment of the Hereafter and of the ‘earlier one’ (i.e., of the present world)"
  79,26,"Verily, in that is indeed an instructive lesson for that who realises the Position (of Allah)"
  79,27,Are you (O mankind!) a more difficult (task) for creation or the heaven which He constructed
  79,28,"He raised its height, so He shaped it in proportion"
  79,29,And He covered its night (with darkness) and brought forth its forenoon (as evidently shining)
  79,30,"And the earth, after this stage, He gave it an oval form"
  79,31,He brought forth therefrom a portion of its water and its pasture
  79,32,"And the mountains: He made them firmly fixed"
  79,33,(All this He arranged) as a provision for you; and for your cattle
  79,34,So when has already approached the great catastrophe (of the Final Day) —
  79,35,the Day the human being brings to mind whatever he strove for
  79,36,And the Hell-Fire is brought to view for that who may see
  79,37,Then if such who transgressed all bounds
  79,38,and preferred the life of this immediate world —
  79,39,"then, surely the Hell-Fire — this, (will be) the Final Abode"
  79,40,"And if that who fully realised the position of his Nourisher-Sustainer, and restrained the Nafs against vain desires —"
  79,41,"then, verily, the Garden of Paradise — this, (will be) the Final Abode"
  79,42,They ask you about the Hour (as to) when will be its appointed time
  79,43,In what (doubt) you are regarding (the) mention thereof
  79,44,(Traceable) towards your Nourisher-Sustainer (is) the ultimate knowledge regarding it
  79,45,"Surely, what (is a fact is that) you (are only) a warner (unto) that who takes care of that (and is heedful)"
  79,46,(It is) like this — that they have not stayed except one evening or one forenoon thereof — the day they come across it
