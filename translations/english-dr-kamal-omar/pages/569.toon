quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,People would be made to watch one another. The sinner would desire that he may pay a ransom to get rid of the torment that Day by (offering) his sons (in ransom)
  70,12,"and his consort, and his brother"
  70,13,and his kinfolks who sheltered him
  70,14,"and whosoever is on the earth — altogether, then (thus) he may redeem himself"
  70,15,"By no means! Surely that (would be) a furiously flaming, blazing Fire —"
  70,16,one that strips off the skin
  70,17,"It (i.e., the blazing Fire invites) that who turned his back (to) and moved away (from Al-Kitab)"
  70,18,and hoarded (wealth) and withheld it (from spending it in accordance with the dictates of his conscience and the Scripture)
  70,19,"Verily, a human being: (as if) he is created impatient"
  70,20,"When Ash-shar (harm) touched him, (he is one) who is extremely disturbed"
  70,21,"And when Al-Khair (good) touched him, (he is one) who hesitates (himself) and also stops others (from spending it in a desirable way) —"
  70,22,except those who adhere to canonical Prayers
  70,23,"those people who: they are constant in offering their Prayers"
  70,24,"and those: in their wealth is a well-known share —"
  70,25,for one who is compelled to ask and that who stands deprived (of the bare needs)
  70,26,and those who Believe and testify the Day of Accountability and Judgment
  70,27,"and those who: they are ever mindful of the torment of their Nourisher-Sustainer"
  70,28,"surely, the torment of their Nourisher-Sustainer (is) not an event that one may feel secure against it"
  70,29,"and those who: they, regarding their private sexual parts are protectors —"
  70,30,except unto their wives or ma-malakat-aimanuhum (the women who are given in guardianship of adult males as their wives under a document prepared by the Muslim state) — then surely they are unblamed people
  70,31,"But whosoever sought beyond that then those people: they very ones are those who break the limits"
  70,32,"And those: they, regarding the trusts with them, and promises with them, (behave as) those who implement with responsibility"
  70,33,and those — they stand firm on their testimonies (till the judgment in the case)
  70,34,"and those — they, over their Prayers act as guards"
  70,35,such a people would dwell in the Gardens (of Paradise) as honoured people
  70,36,Then what (is the matter) with those who have disbelieved; in front of you they are those who swiftly move hither and thither (without paying attention to the teachings you propagate)
  70,37,from the right (side) and from the left side in splinter groups
  70,38,Does every man of them wish that he may be allowed entry in the Garden of delight
  70,39,"By no means! Verily We, We created them out of that which they know"
