quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,30,"And when your Nourisher-Sustainer said to the angels: “I am about to place Khalifa on earth.” They said: “Will you place therein one who makes disorder therein and sheds blood, while we are steadfast in Your glorification and propagate Your Highness?” (Allah) said: “Certainly I know more, what you do not know.”"

  2,32,"They said: “Glory to You, we have no knowledge except what you have taught us. Verily You, You (are) the All-Knower, the All-Wise.”"
  2,33,"(Allah) said: “O Adam! Inform these (angels) about their characteristics.” Then while (Adam) informed them about their characteristics, (Allah) said: “Did I not tell you that I know the ghaib (unseen and hidden) of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you have been concealing?”"
