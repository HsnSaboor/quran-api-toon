quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  43,34,"and for their houses, doors and couches — they would recline thereat"
  43,35,and gold-ornaments. And yet all this would have been but an enjoyment and provision relating to the life of this world. And the Hereafter with your Nourisher-Sustainer is meant for Muttaqun (those who pay obedience to Allah in accordance with the teachings in Al-Kitab)
