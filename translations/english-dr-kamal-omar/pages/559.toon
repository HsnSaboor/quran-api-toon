  65,6,"Provide them residence in the same place and standard as you stayed, according to your means and do not hurt them that you may create unto them hurdles (indirectly pressurising them to vacate your residences). And if they happened to be holders of the product of gestation, then spend on them till they deliver their pregnancy.

Indeed Allah has made excellent for him (the) provision"
  65,12,"Allah is That Who created seven (or many) heavens and of the earth the like thereof (i.e., seven or many). The order (controlling various activities) descends amongst them (all) so that you (O human beings!) realise that Allah is All-Capable over everything. And that Allah has indeed comprehended every thing in Knowledge (available in Him)"
