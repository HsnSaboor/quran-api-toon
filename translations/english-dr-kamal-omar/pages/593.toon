quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,Al-Fajr (the break of dawn) acts as a witness
  89,2,"and (also) the night, ten (in number)"
  89,3,"and the even (number), and the odd (number)"
  89,4,and the (retreating) night when it departs
  89,5,Is in (all) this an evidence or testimony for a possessor of wisdom
  89,6,Have you not seen how your Nourisher-Sustainer dealt with ‘Ad (people) —
  89,7,"(of the capital-city of) Iram, possessing lofty high-rise buildings"
  89,8,such as their like are not constructed (any where) in the cities
  89,9,"and (with) Samud (people), those who hewed and cut rocks in the valley"
  89,10,"and (with) Firaun, famous by the pyramids"
  89,11,those people who transgressed beyond limits throughout the cities
  89,12,and they tremendously increased in those (cities) Al-Fasad
  89,13,So your Nourisher-Sustainer let fall over them the whip of punishment
  89,14,"Surely, your Nourisher-Sustainer is indeed (ever) in Al-Mirsad"
  89,15,"As for the human being: when his Nourisher-Sustainer put him to trial and tribulation, and He bestowed upon him honour and bestowed upon him luxuries — then he will say: 'My Rabb has given me honour"
  89,16,"And so, when, whatever He put him to test and trial: so He bestowed over him his provision just according to bare needs — then he will say: 'My Rabb has humiliated (and disgraced) me"
  89,17,"By no means! Nay, you (on your side) do not treat Al-Yatim with kindness and generosity"
  89,18,and urge not for (providing) food to the indigent
  89,19,"and you devour inheritance — a devouring, absolute and excessive"
  89,20,and you love the wealth with intense love
  89,21,"By no means (it is going to benefit you)! When the (planet) earth is broken up to a (complete) breahead of state up, an (extensive) break-up"
  89,22,"And has come your Nourisher-Sustainer, and (also) the angels in rows, (regular) rows"
  89,23,"And the Hell is brought (very near) that Day. That Day the human being brings to mind the Message (of Allah). And how Az-Zikrah (‘The Admonition’,) benefits him (at such a stage)"
