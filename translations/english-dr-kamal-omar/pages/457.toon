quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  38,62,"And they (also) said: “What (is the matter) with us (that) we see not men whom we used to count out of those having bad intentions"
  38,63,"Did we take them in mockery, or have the eyes shifted from them ?”"
  38,64,"Verily, this indeed is truth — the mutual dispute of the people of the Fire"
  38,65,"Say: “Surely, what (is a fact is that) I am (only) a warner, and (there is) not out of an ilah except Allah, the One, the Irresistible —"
  38,66,"The Nourisher-Sustainer of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between those two, the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving.”"
  38,67,"Say: “Huwa [That (i.e., the Message which I propagate as the Book of Allah, is the)] News, Supreme"
  38,68,You are against it (as) those who remain heedless and unconcerned
  38,69,There is not for me any knowledge regarding the higher elite when they discuss and dispute
  38,70,It is not inspired to me except that what (is a fact is that) I am a plain warner.”
  38,71,"When your Nourisher-Sustainer said to the angels: “Verily, I am about to create a human out of clay"
  38,72,"So when I have perfected him, and I have breathed into him out of My Spirit, then you (all) become for him (as) those who prostrate (to Me)"
  38,73,So the angels prostrated — all of them together
  38,74,"except Iblis (and being out of the jinns) he became arrogant (because he had his choice with him, which the angels do not possess) and he became out of the rejectors"
  38,75,"(Allah) said: “O Iblis! What prevented you that you may prostrate for what I created with My two Hands? Have you gone arrogant or are you out of those who are high and exalted?”"
  38,76,"(Iblis) said: “I am better than he; You created me from fire and You created him from clay.”"
  38,77,"(Allah) said: (since iblis was intoxicated in genealogical pride) \"Then get out from this (place and position) because you are surely an outcast"
  38,78,"And verily, My curse is on you till the Day of judgement.”"
  38,79,"(Iblis) said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Then grant me respite till the day the people shall be resurrected.”"
  38,80,"(Allah) said: “Then surely you are of those who are given respite —"
  38,81,till the Day of the well-known Time
  38,82,"(Iblis) said: “So, by Your Honour! Surely I will mislead them all —"
  38,83,"except Your Ibad, out of them, who have been cleansed and sanctified (as Mercy from You).”"
