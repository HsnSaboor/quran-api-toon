quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  48,24,And He it is Who restrained their hands from you and (withheld) your hands from them within (the) Batn (belly) of Makka; after that He had made you dominating over them. And Allah has remained Well-Acquainted of what you do
  48,25,"They happened to be those who have disbelieved and hindered you from Al-Masjid-al-Haram, and thus Al-Hadiya (the Gift of sacrificial animals) became detained — that it may reach its specified place. And had there not been Believing men and the Believing women, you people do not know them, so you will trample them; and because of them a serious deviation from the correct step inflicts you (and goes to your account as a sin) because of the absence of knowledge. (If the situation was not such, We would have allowed an armed encounter in place of a treaty of peace) — so that Allah may admit into His Mercy whom He may think proper. If (the two groups, i.e., the Believers and the disbelievers were not intermixed and had already) separated (to be recognised easily, then) surely We would have punished those who had disbelieved amongst you in the form of a painful torment (by the aided hands of the Believing army)"
  48,26,"When those who disbelieved had placed in their hearts the pride and haughtiness — pride and haughtiness based on ignorance, then Allah made to descend His Sakinah upon His Messenger and upon the Believers. And He kept them attached to the statement of obedience (La-ilaha-ill-Allah Muhammadun Rasulullah. See Verses 37/35, 48/29), and they were more entitled to it and worthy of it. And Allah is All-Knower of every thing"
  48,27,"Surely, indeed Allah has fulfilled for His Messenger the vision with full justice. Certainly, you shall enter Al-Masjid-al-Haram, if Allah thought proper, as attainers of peace, (and as) those who have submitted their heads to a clean-shave, and (as) those who (got their scalp-hair) trimmed. You will feel no fear. So He knew what you knew not, that is why He sanctioned instead of this Fathan Qariban ['an immediate success.' (This Fathan Qariban is the treaty of peace signed in the belly of Makka which makes the Believers to interrupt the programme of attending the Hajj and also stops them from offering Animal-Sacrifice at the proper place meant and specified for it)][Please note that attending to the haircut is compulsory before initiating the 2nd part of the Hajj-Congregation]"
  48,28,"He it is Who has sent His Messenger with Al-Hudah and the True, Legitimate, Original Religion that He may make it prevail over way of life — to each and every aspect of it, and sufficient is Allah as Witness"
