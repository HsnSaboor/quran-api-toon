  67,3,That One Who created seven (or many) heavens (having) fields one beyond another. You do not see in the creation of Ar-Rahman any gap or break. So direct (your) vision (send this as beyond as possible). Do you see any cracks
  67,4,"Afterwards, direct the vision twice, the watching-light would rebound towards you unsuccessful (to penetrate the universe) and it (is) returned and checked"
  67,5,"And surely, indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with shining objects, and We have made them as stringent chasers against the devils. And We have prepared for them punishment of the blazing fire"

  67,10,"And they said: “Had we been listening or using intellect, we would not have been among the companions of the blazing Fire.”"
