quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,52,"They are those whom Allah has cursed and whom Allah curses, then you never find for him a helper"
  4,53,"Is, for them, a share in the dominion? Then in that case they would not give mankind (even the measure of a) Naqira"
  4,54,"Or do they envy men for what Allah has given them out of His Bounty? Then, certainly, We delivered to the followers of Ibrahim Al-Kitab and Al-Hikmah and conferred upon them a great head of statedom"
  4,55,Then out of them (who were given Al-Kitab is) that who Believed in this (Al-Kitab rebrought in its Original) and out of them (is also) that who detached link with it. And enough is Hell as a blazing Fire
  4,56,"Surely those who have disbelieved in Our Ayaat, soon We shall cast them in Fire. Every time their skins got fully roasted, we changed them in other than that (already roasted) so that they may (continue to) taste the punishment. Truly, Allah is All-Dominant, All-Wise"
  4,57,"And those who have Believed and did righteous acts, soon We shall admit them to Gardens — flow under them rivers — dwellers therein forever. For them, therein, (are) companions, cleansed and purified; and We shall admit them to a shade, shaded repeatedly"
  4,58,"Verily, Allah commands you to return the trusts to their owners; and that when you judge between people, you judge with justice. Verily, how excellent (it is) He admonishes you therewith. Truly, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Seer"
  4,59,"O you people who have Believed! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority from amongst you (Muslims). Then if you differed (in your opinions) amongst you about any thing, then you refer it to Allah and His Messenger (i.e., to the Book of Allah) if you are: you Believe in Allah and the Last Day. This (is) better and more suitable for achieving results"
