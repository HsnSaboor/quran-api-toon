quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,15,"And when are recited to them Our Ayaat which are evidently manifest, said those who do not hope a meeting with Us: “Come to us with a Quran other than this or change it.” Say: “It suits not me that I may change it from the inclination of my ownself. I do not follow except what has been made evident to me. Verily, I fear, if I disobeyed my Nourisher-Sustainer, punishment on the great Day.”"
  10,16,"Say: “If Allah had willed I would not have recited it to you, nor He had made it known to you. So, verily, I have stayed amongst you a lifetime before this. Do you then not use your sense?”"
  10,17,"So, who is a bigger transgressor than that who forged a lie against Allah or denied His Ayaat? Surely it (is that) the criminals do not become successful"
  10,18,"And they obey besides Allah that hurts them not, nor gives them (any) profit and they say: “All these are intercessors to us unto Allah.” Say: “Do you inform Allah of that which He knows not in the heavens, and nor on the earth? He became glorified and became very High in comparison to what they assign as partners (to Him)"
  10,19,"And mankind is not but one single community, then they (due to various reasons) differed (among themselves). And if a commitment was not already given from your Nourisher-Sustainer, surely (the matter) would have been settled between them regarding what they differ therein"
  10,20,"And they say: “Why not has been sent to him a Sign from his Nourisher-Sustainer?” So, Say: “Definitely, what is unseen belongs to Allah, so wait you, verily I am with you, from amongst those who wait.”"
