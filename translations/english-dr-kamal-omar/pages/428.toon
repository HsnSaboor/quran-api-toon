quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  34,1,"Selective Praise suits Allah, That to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And for Him is the selective Praise in the Hereafter, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Aware"
  34,2,"He knows what enters the earth and what comes out of it, and that what descends from towards the sky and whatever ascends therein. And He is the continuously Merciful, the Oft-Forgiving"
  34,3,"And those who disbelieved said: \"The Hour will not come to us.” Say: \"Nay, by my Nourisher-Sustainer! Surely, it will come to you.” (Allah is) All-Knower of the unseen. Does not escape from him (even the) weight of a minute particle throughout the heavens, and nor in the earth; — and nor (any thing) smaller from this and nor greater — but it is in a crystal-clear record"
  34,4,"so that He may reward those who have Believed and performed righteous deeds. Those: for them is forgiveness and an honourable provision"
  34,5,"And those who strove in Ayaatina (‘Our Verses’) as those who are bent upon frustrating the purpose — those: for them will be punishment of a painful suffering"
  34,6,"And those who have been given Al-Ilm (‘The Knowledge’), see (and mark out) that what has been sent to you from your Nourisher-Sustainer, it is Al-Haqq (‘The Truth’ or ‘The Original’), and it guides to the Path of the Exalted in Might, the Most Praised One"
  34,7,"And those who have disbelieved said: “Shall we direct you to a male-adult who will tell you (that) when you have become (finally) disintegrated into dust with full dispersion — surely, you will indeed be in a new creation"
