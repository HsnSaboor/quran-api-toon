quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"To Him is referred the knowledge of the Hour (by all men of learning). And does not come out of its sheath any of the fruits; and does not conceive any one of the females, and nor she delivers, but with His Knowledge. And the Day He calls unto them: “Where (have gone) My (so-called) partners?” They said: “We have informed You — there is not from amongst us (any one) out of a witness (to our false claims that You had partners in Your Dominion).”"
  41,48,And vanished from them whom they used to invoke in (times) before. And they have realised (that there is) not for them (any) out of a place of refuge
  41,49,"A human being does not get tired of an invokation (or prayer) for good; and if an affliction touched him, then (immediately he is that) who has given up all hope, (and one) who has gone in despair"
  41,50,"And surely, if We gave him a taste of mercy from Us after an adversity that has touched him, he will surely say: “This (came) to me (as a right due to my personal capabilities and qualities), and I think not the Hour as an event that (must) establish (itself). And (even) if I returned to my Nourisher-Sustainer, surely for me with Him (will be) indeed something extremely good.” So surely, We shall inform those who have disbelieved about what they did; and surely, We will make them taste out of a severe torment"
  41,51,"And when We favoured a human being, he deviated, and he bowed to his own inclination. And when an adversity inflicted him, then instantly (he is one) involved in long supplications"
  41,52,"Say: “Have you (ever) thought if (this Al-Kitab or Al-Quran) be from Allah but you disbelieved therein, (then) who is more astray than that? He is in opposition, far (and remote).”"
  41,53,"Soon We show them Our Ayaat (Signs) in the universe, and in their own persons, until becomes clear unto them that it is Al-Haqq (‘The Truth’). Does it not then suffice with your Nourisher-Sustainer that He (remains) a Witness over all things"
  41,54,"Beware! Truly, they are in doubt concerning the meeting with their Nourisher-Sustainer. Be careful! Surely, He is All-Comprehending to every thing"
