quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,40,"Perchance we may follow the sorcerers if they became: they (very ones) as winners?”"
  26,41,"So when the magicians arrived, they said to Firaun: “Will surely there be for us a certain reward if we became — we (as) the winners?”"
  26,42,"He said: “Yes (of course), and verily you shall then, surely be of those who have been delegated nearness (to my person).”"
  26,43,"Musa said to them: “Throw (on the ground) what you intend to throw.”"
  26,44,"So they threw their ropes and their rods, and said “By the might of Firaun, certainly we — surely, we (will be) the winners"
  26,45,"Then Musa dropped his rod, so instantly it swallows all the falsehood which they indulge in"
  26,46,So the sorcerers were made to drop (themselves on the ground as) those who are prostrating (in humility to Allah)
  26,47,"They said: “We have developed Faith in the Nourisher-Sustainer of the worlds —"
  26,48,Nourisher-Sustainer of Musa and Harun!”
  26,49,"(Firaun) said: “You have Believed for his sake prior to that I give you permission. Surely, he indeed is your senior-most who has taught you magic. So surely, soon you will come to know. Without doubt, I will chop off your hands and your legs on opposite sides, and surely I will crucify you all.”"
  26,50,"(The magicians who were now sincere and devoted Muslims) said: “No harm (it does to us). Surely we are those who return to our Nourisher-Sustainer"
  26,51,"Surely, we desire exceedingly that Our Nourisher-Sustainer may forgive for us our sins as we become the first Believers (out of the nation of Firaun).”"
  26,52,"And We sent inspiration to Musa that: “Move away (emigrate) with My Ibad, surely you are those who are being chased.”"
  26,53,So Firaun sent callers in all the cities
  26,54,"(Saying): “Verily, these indeed are a minority — a very small band of people"
  26,55,"And verily, they have acted with us, surely as those who enrage (us)"
  26,56,"And verily, we indeed are a multitude (i.e., a great nation) fully vigilant.”"
  26,57,"So, We expelled them from orchards and streams"
  26,58,and treasures and position of honour
  26,59,Thus (it all happened) and We gave it (all) in inheritance to Bani Israiel
  26,60,So they pursued them as those who were witnessing the sunrise
