quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"But they denied him, so surely they will certainly be those brought forth (to the punishment)"
  37,128,except Ibad of Allah who were cleansed and sanctified
  37,129,And We established for him among the later generations —
  37,130,"Salamun [peace (and blessings be)] upon Ilyasin"
  37,131,"Surely We, thus do We reward Al-Muhsinun"
  37,132,"Verily, he (was) out of Our Believing Ibad"
  37,133,"And verily, Lout (was) surely of the Messengers —"
  37,134,"when We saved him and his family, all together"
  37,135,except one who had crossed the age of fertility and hope — (we left her) among those who bury themselves in dust and debris
  37,136,Then We annihilated the rest
  37,137,"And verily, you people pass by them as those who see the morning (i.e., during the early morning journey)"
  37,138,and at night . Will you not then use your intellect
  37,139,"And verily, Yunus (was) surely of the Messengers —"
  37,140,when he swiftly moved towards the fully loaded ship
  37,141,"as a result he slipped, so he became of those who have fallen down"
  37,142,"Then a (big) fish swallowed him while he (is) one who blames (his own, and has no complaint against his Creator)"
  37,143,"And that (if) he had not been of those who glorify (Allah) much (i.e., those who are always mindful of the ordainments of Allah)"
  37,144,surely he would have tarried in its belly uptil the Day when people would be raised (to a new life of Resurrection)
  37,145,So We brought him on the bare land along the shore while he was exhausted
  37,146,"And We caused to grow, for his sake, a plant of the gourd kind"
  37,147,"And We sent him as Messenger to a (nation of) hundred thousand (people), or, they will breed in number"
  37,148,"Then, (when preaching was reinforced over them), they Believed, so We gave them provision for the limited period"
  37,149,"So ask them: “Are (there only) daughters for your Nourisher-Sustainer and sons (exclusively) for them"
  37,150,Or did We create the angels as females while they (acted as) witnesses
  37,151,"Be careful! Certainly they, out of their fabrication they will surely say"
  37,152,“Allah has begotten (children)”. And certainly they are indeed liars
  37,153,Has He chosen daughters in preference to sons
