quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,"Is that one whose Sadr (chest) Allah has made open (i.e., receptive) for Islam, so he takes a stand on (the) Light (received) from his Nourisher-Sustainer, (could be considered of the same status as a disbeliever)? So woe to those whose hearts are hardened against (receiving) Zikr ('Message') of Allah; they (stand) in manifest error"
  39,23,"Allah has sent down Ahsan-al-Hadees [‘The Better Hadees’ (Narration)] Kitaban Mutashabihan Masani [a Book, mutually supporting (its statements); (and) repeating (its Verdicts in diverse forms to make one understand and grasp)]. The skins of those who are conscious and mindful of the position of their Nourisher-Sustainer, shiver from it (when they feel the force and impact of the Message). Then their skins and their hearts soften towards Zikr (Message) of Allah. This is Hudah (guidance) from Allah. He guides therewith whom He thinks proper. And whomsoever Allah lets go astray — then (there is) not for him out of (any) guide. [Please note that this Verse contains, in all, four attributes for Al-Kitab. Two of these are single worded like Zikr and Hudah. One is three worded, while Ahsan-al-Hadees is two worded attribute for the Book of Allah. Allah recognises only His Book as the collection of Authentic Ahadees]"
  39,24,"Is then that one who takes protection from the evil of the punishment on the Day of Resurrection with his own face (i.e., his righteous deads) — could he be equal to that who is a transgressor)? And it was proclaimed unto the transgressors: “Taste what you used to earn.”"
  39,25,"Those before them belied, so the torment came on them from directions and sites they do not perceive"
  39,26,"So Allah made them to taste the disgrace in the present life, and surely the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they had been knowing"
  39,27,"And surely, indeed We have put forth for mankind in this Al-Quran out of all similitudes, perchance they may remind (the Message to themselves and to others) —"
  39,28,"Qur’an (in) Arabic (language) — not a possessor of Evaj (crookedness, or deviation from rectitude)— perchance people may pay obedience (to Allah)"
  39,29,"Allah did bring a parable: a man, in him are share-holders, those who have disputes among themselves (and do not agree on a joint or uniform approach); and (on the other side is) a man completely subservient for one person (alone). Are they both equal when a parable is brought (to explain their position)? Selective Praise suits Allah (Alone). Nay, majority of them do not know"
  39,30,"Verily, you [O Prophet (the addressee is singular)] are about to die, and surely they (i.e., the other people, too) are about to die"
  39,31,"Then surely, you people, on the Day of Resurrection before your Nourisher-Sustainer, you will fall in disputes"
