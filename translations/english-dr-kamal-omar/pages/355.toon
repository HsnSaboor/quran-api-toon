quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  24,37,"(by) men: diverts them not business, and nor trade from Zikr (‘Message’) of Allah, and establishment of Salat and paying-up Zakat. They fear a Day — the hearts and the eyes will feel agitated therein"
  24,38,"so that Allah may pay them the better of what they did, and add (even more) for them out of His Grace. And Allah gives provision whom He thinks proper without measure"
  24,39,"As for those who have disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it (to be) water, until when he approached it, he does not find it to be anything but he found Allah all along with him so He paid him in full his account. And Allah is Swift in reckoning"
  24,40,"Or (the mind of a disbeliever is) like darknesses in a vast deep sea, a (great) wave covers it, on the upper surface of this is (another great) wave, (and) on the upper surface of this (are) dark clouds — some of them are above some (others, layers over layer). When he stretched out his hand he could not see it. And that for whom Allah has not arranged Noor (Light), then (there is) not for him from Noor"
  24,41,"Don‘t you see that Allah: pays glory to Him whoever is in the heavens and the earth and birds in formation? All of them, definitely knew Salat prescribed to it and Tasbeeh (Glorification format) prescribed to it. And Allah is All-Aware of what they do"
  24,42,"And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and towards Allah is the Returning Place"
  24,43,"Don’t you see that Allah moves up the clouds, then creates a union between it, then makes it piled up, then you see rain-water makes an exit from in between it? And he sends down from towards the sky, from the mountains — therein is of (frozen, stored) ice. Then He reaches with it whom He thinks proper and diverts it away from whom He thinks proper. It appears that the vivid flash of its (i.e., the clouds’) lightning will pass away alongwith the eyes (i.e., the lightning flash will damage and blind the eye-sights of people)"
