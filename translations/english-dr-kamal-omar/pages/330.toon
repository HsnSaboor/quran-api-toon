quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  21,91,And (remember) that lady who guarded her sexual parts. So We breathed (introduced) into her out of Our Spirit and We made her and her son Aayatan-lil-Alamin (A Sign unto the worlds)
  21,92,"Verily, this community of you people (is but) one community, and I am Nourisher-Sustainer to you people, so pay obedience to Me"
  21,93,But the people divided their affair among themselves. All (would be) those who return to Us
  21,94,"So whoever does out of the righteous deeds and he is (also) a Believer — then there is no overloohead of state to his effort. And verily, We are acting as those Who record (the deeds) to his credit"
  21,95,And it is banned for a town which We have destroyed that they shall not return (to this world any more and would have no chance to repent to Us)
  21,96,"Until, when Yajuj (Gog) and Majuj (Magog) are let loose (from their barrier), and they swiftly assault from all the high points"
  21,97,"The True Promise (about the Last and the Final Day) came very, very near. Then, behold! It — the fixedly staring eyes of those who disbelieved (and their comments): “Woe to us! We were indeed heedless of this. Nay, we were transgressors.”"
  21,98,Certainly! You (disbelievers) and that which you worship besides Allah (act as) fuel for Hell. You with respect to it are those who must enter (it)
  21,99,"Had these (whom you worship) been gods, they would not have entered it and all would be dwellers therein"
  21,100,"For them therein is groaning, and they therein will not listen (other sounds of the inmates)"
  21,101,"Surely, those for whom (a promise about) good in excellence has already gone forth from Us: they will be those who are kept far away from it"
