quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,144,"He said: “O Musa! I have chosen you over mankind through My Messages and through My Statement. So pick-up what I have given you and be among the grateful.”"
  7,145,"And We wrote for him on Al-Alwah out of all things as Mauizah and Tafseelan-lekulle-sha’in. So (We directed Musa thus): “Hold unto these with firmness and enjoin your nation that they should adopt the better of it. Very soon We show you the home of Al-Fasiqun"
  7,146,Soon I shall turn away from My Ayaat those who behave in arrogance on the earth without (any) right and if they noticed each and every Ayat they will not believe in them. And if they noticed the path to righteousness they will not adopt it as the Way. And if they noticed the path of rebellion they will adopt it as the way. This is because they have belied Our Ayaat and they remained unaware of them
  7,147,"And those who belied Our Ayaat and the Meeting in the Hereafter, their actions have become of no effect. Would they be rewarded (any thing) other than what they had been doing (in their actions, concepts and thinhead of states)"
  7,148,"And the nation of Musa carved, in his absence, out of their ornaments, the body-form of a calf (mechanising) to it a mooing sound. Did they not see that it does not speak to them and does not guide them the way? They picked it (as a god in cow-worship) and they became transgressors"
  7,149,"And when it was dismantled (by Musa and they received the pieces) in their hands and they realised that they have definitely gone astray, (in repentance) they said: “Surely, if our Nourisher-Sustainer does not shower Mercy on us and forgives us, out of a surety, we become out of the losers.”"
