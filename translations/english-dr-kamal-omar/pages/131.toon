quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,28,Nay! (Now) has become manifest to them what they had been hiding since before. And if they were sent back (to the earth) they definitely reverted to what they were prohibited thereto and indeed they are surely liars
  6,29,"And they said: “(There is) no (life-span additional to) this except our life of this world, and we shall not be out of those who are Resurrected"
  6,30,"And if you saw when they were made to stand before their Nourisher-Sustainer, (and) He said: “Is not this (Resurrection and Accountability) in Truth?” They said: “Yes, by our Nourisher-Sustainer! \" He (i.e., Allah) said: \"So, you people taste the punishment of what you had been disbelieving.”"
  6,31,"Definitely, have lost those who denied (their) meeting with Allah till a point when the Hour engulfed them out of a sudden. They said: “O, alas for us over that we gave no thought to it.” And they will bear their burdens on their backs. Be careful, evil it is they will bear"
  6,32,And this worldly life is nothing but play and amusement. And surely the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who pay obedience (to Allah). Will you then not use (your) intellect
  6,33,"Surely We know (that) indeed that definitely gives you grief what they utter. So truly (speahead of state) they do not deny you, rather the transgressors strive and argue against the Ayaat of Allah"
  6,34,"And without doubt, were (also) denied the Messengers before you, then they showed forbearance over what they were denied, and they were hurt till the stage Our Help reached them, and none (exists any where as) the alterer or modifier for the statements of Allah (in His Al-Kitab). And surely has reached you out of the news about the Messengers"
  6,35,"And if has happened hard on you their aversion (from the Message), then if you had the capacity that you find a passage in the ground or a vehicle to the sky (and) then you come to them with a proof (or sign, you could attempt that.). And had Allah willed indeed, He could have gathered them together unto Al-Huda, so be not you out of Al-Jahilun"
