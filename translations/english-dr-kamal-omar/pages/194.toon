quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,41,March forth (whether) light (not properly armed) or heavy (fully armed) and strive hard with your possessions and your personalities in the Cause of Allah. This is better for you if you had been knowing (the truth)
  9,42,"Had there been an immediate gain, and an easy journey, they would have followed you, but the hardship (of the journey and the season) appeared extreme to them. And they would soon swear by Allah: “If we only could, we would certainly have gone out with you.” They destroy their personalities, and Allah knows: certainly they, without doubt, are liars"
  9,43,"Allah has forgiven you, (but) why did you grant them permission until it had become clear to you (as to who were) those who spoke the truth and you had (also clearly) known the liars"
  9,44,Do not ask your permission those who Believe in Allah and the Last Day that they may strive hard with their possessions and their personalities (in the Cause of Allah. Rather they come of their own as volunteers)
  9,45,"Definitely it is that ask your permission those who do not have Faith in Allah and the Last Day; and their hearts fell in doubt, so they are in a state of doubt in their own (and thus) they waver"
  9,46,"And if they had intended to march out, certainly they would have arranged for it some preparation. But Allah became averse to their being sent forth, so He made them lag behind and (it) was said (to them): “Sit (behind) with those who sit (behind at their homes like the ill or the invalids)"
  9,47,If they had marched out amongst you they would not have increased for you except disorder; and surely they would have hurried about in your midst. They seek against you Fitnah. And amongst you are listeners (who come to listen to you and then report back) in their interest (to the chief devils). And Allah is Fully Aware of the transgressors
