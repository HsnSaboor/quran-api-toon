quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,7,"Verily, those who hope not for a meeting with Us and are fully pleased with the life of the present world and they became satisfied with it; and those: they are heedless to Our Ayaat"
  10,8,"those: their abode will be the Fire, because of what they used to earn (through their beliefs, concepts and deeds)"
  10,9,"Verily, those who have Believed and did righteous deeds, their Nourisher-Sustainer will guide them through their Faith. Rivers will flow underneath them in Gardens of delight"
  10,10,"Their manner of invocation therein (will be) Subhanaka Allahumma (Glory be to You, beloved Allah!) and their greeting (to one another) therein (will be) Salam [Peace and tranquility (be from Allah over you)] and the closing (words) in their call (will be) that: Al-Hamd-o-Lillahe-Rabbil-Alamin"
  10,11,"And if Allah hastens for mankind the evil (outcome) (as would have been) their swiftness (of demand) for a good (out come), surely would have been settled to them their term (of respite). Then leave those who hope not for a meeting with Us, in their turmoil they would wander blindly"
  10,12,"And when a trouble or calamity touched a human being, he invoked Us while lying down on his side, or sitting, or standing. So as when We removed from him his trouble he slipped away as if he did not invoke Us for the trouble which touched him! Thus has become fair-seeming to the Musrifun what they used to do"
  10,13,"And indeed, We destroyed generations before you for what they transgressed. And came to them their Messengers with Al-Bayyinat but they were not (such) as to Believe. Thus We reward the nation of criminals"
  10,14,"Then We made you generations after generations in the earth after them, that We might see how you would work"
