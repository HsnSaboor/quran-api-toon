quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,65,"And Allah sent down (rain-) water from towards the sky, then He gave life to the earth after its death. Verily, in this is indeed a sign for the nation who listen (to the word of Allah in His Al-Kitab)"
  16,66,"And verily, in the cattle there is a lesson for you. We give you to drink out of that which is in their bellies from between excretions and blood — milk, pure, palatable to those who drink (desirable liquids)"
  16,67,"And from the fruits of date-palms and grapes, you people derive intoxicant drink as well as good and recommended eatables and drinks. Verily, in this (that the same source is being used to derive unpalatable and harmful as well as palatable and useful) indeed, is a sign for the nation who use intellect"
  16,68,"And your Nourisher-Sustainer sent Wahi (inspiration) to the honey-bee (telling her) that: “Select and pick-up some of the sites in mountains as hives, and (also select such sites) out of a tree, and out of (any items) that people raise to a height"
  16,69,"Then take inside your belly out of all fruits, then follow the tracks of your Nourisher-Sustainer dutifully and diligently.\" There comes forth out of their bellies a liquid-drink whose colours (become) different (depending upon the areas and orchards which the bees select) — herein is healing-power to (the diseases of) mankind. Definitely, in this is indeed (yet another) sign for the nation who think and ponder"
  16,70,"And Allah has created you, afterwards He will cause you to die. And of you is that who is sent back to the weakest and tendermost portion of age (much similar to the times when he was a new born or an infant or a child), so that (then) he knows not anything after (he had attained considerable maturity and climax in) knowledge. Verily, Allah (Only) is All-Knowing, All-Capable"
  16,71,"And Allah has elevated, some of you over some (others) in provision. Then those who have been elevated, do not become those who share their provision with those whom their right hands held in trust so that they become at the same footing. Do they then create hurdles for the bestowings of Allah (from reaching every one in equal proportion)"
  16,72,"And Allah appointed for you out of your own Anfus (persons) spouses and He set for you through your marital-partners children and grand children; and He provided you provisions out of At-Tayyibat. Do they then Believe in that which is unrealistic and regarding the bestowings of Allah they exhibit disbelief? [This statement desires that the provisions provided to mankind by Allah in this world must be made to be equally shared by all]"
