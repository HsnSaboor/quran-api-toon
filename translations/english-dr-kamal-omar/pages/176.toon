  7,201,"Verily, those who have paid obedience (to Al-Kitab): when an evil thought coming from Satan kept them involved — they reminded their selves (about Allah and the related Ayaat in His Book), then instantly they (become) those who can view (the mischief of Satan and the Grace of Allah)"
  7,202,"And the brothers to those (satans): they (i.e., satans) plunge them deeper into rebellion (against the Ayaat of Al-Kitab). Afterwards they do not stop short (in their aberrant attitude)"
  7,203,"And when you did not come to them with a Sign (according to their expectations) they said: “Why have you not brought such (and such)?” Say: “Surely it is that I follow whatever has been inspired to me from my Nourisher-Sustainer. These are Basair (‘Eye-Sights’) from your Nourisher-Sustainer, and Hudah (‘Guidance’), and Rahmah to a nation who Believe"
