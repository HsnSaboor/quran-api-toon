quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  20,99,Thus We relate to you out of the news what definitely happened before. And indeed We have given you from Uz-Zikr (‘The Message’)
  20,100,"Whoever avoided it: so certainly he will bear on the Day of Resurrection a heavy burden (of ignorance, inattention, errors and sins)"
  20,101,"(they will continue as) those who stay in this (state in the Fire of Hell); and evil, for them, on the Day of Resurrection, is the load (they bear)"
  20,102,"The Day when the Siren will be blown, and We gather the Mujrimun that Day in a bluish-state (due to extreme anxiety and fear, the state of the heart becomes abnormal and weak, leading to anoxia, which appears as a blue-colouration extending throughout the body)"
  20,103,"They will whisper among themselves: “You stayed not but (just) ten days (i.e., for a very short while).”"
  20,104,"We know better what they will state, when the more eminent of them in conduct will say: “You stayed not but a day (only)!”"
  20,105,"And people ask you concerning the mountains, so tell (them): “My Nourisher-Sustainer will scatter them as dust"
  20,106,"Then He shall leave it (i.e., the ground where the mountains stood) as a levelled, smooth plain"
  20,107,"You will not see therein depression, and nor elevation.”"
  20,108,On that Day (the Mujrimun) will strictly follow the caller (showing) no deviation in relation to him. And the voices dimmed and humbled before Ar-Rahman. So you shall not hear except the subdued sound of footsteps
  20,109,On this Day intercession shall not avail (any person) except that for whom Ar-Rahman gave permission and (also) agreed to the statement (given) in his favour
  20,110,He knows whatever is between their hands and whatever is behind them and they comprehend it not (in their) knowledge
  20,111,"And the faces became down-cast before Ever-Living, Ever-Sustaining (Allah). And surely became a failure that who carried burden of wrong-doings"
  20,112,"And whoever performs out of righteous deeds and he is (also) a Believer, then he fears not of injustice and nor any curtailment (of his reward)"
  20,113,"And thus We have sent it down as a Qur’an in Arabic; and have scattered therein out of the warnings in order that they pay obedience, or it may fully describe for them the Zikr (Message)"
