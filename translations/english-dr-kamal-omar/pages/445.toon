quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  36,71,"Have they then not seen that We created for them of what Our Hands have done — the cattle, then they thereof (have become) owners"
  36,72,"And We have subdued them unto them, so thereof (are) their rides and therefrom they eat"
  36,73,And for them therein (are many) benefits as well as drinks. Will they not then pay thanks (to the Creator)
  36,74,"And they have taken besides Allah, aaliha, so that they may be provided help"
  36,75,"They have no capacity for providing them help. And they (i.e., the followers of the false deities) are unto them (i.e., unto the false gods) like (a blind) horde — the people who have been brought (before Allah for receiving punishment due to their polytheism)"
  36,76,"So let not their statement (about other gods) grieve you. Verily, We know what they hide and what they proclaim"
  36,77,"Has then the human being not seen that We, We created him from Nutfah? Yet lo! He (comes forward) as an open disputer (about Our Identity)"
  36,78,"And he coined similitude for Us and forgot his own creation. He said: “Who will give life to these bones when they are decayed into dust?”"
  36,79,"Say: “He will give them life Who initiated them the first time.\" And He is All-Knower of every creation"
  36,80,"That One Who produced to you fire out of the green tree, then behold! You kindle therewith (your stoves)"
  36,81,"Is not then He Who created the heavens and the earth capable of this that He may create the like of them? Yes, indeed! And He (happens to be) the All-Knowing, Supreme Creator"
  36,82,"Surely, what (is a fact is that) His Command, when He intended something (is) that He will say to it, ‘Be’! Instantly it comes into being"
  36,83,So glory be to Him in Whose Hand are the dominions of all things; and to Him will you (all) be brought back
