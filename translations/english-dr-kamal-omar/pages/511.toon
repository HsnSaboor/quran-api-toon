  48,2,"that Allah may forgive whatever preceded of your sin and whatever occurred later; and He may complete His Favour on you, and He may guide you to the Permanent Path"
  48,3,"and Allah may provide you help, aid and assistance — a mighty and powerful assistance"
  48,4,"He it is Who sent down As-Sakinah (calmness and tranquility) into the hearts of the Believers so that they may increase Faith-wise alongwith their (existing depth of) Faith. And to Allah belong the forces of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise"
  48,5,"so that He may admit the Believing males and the Believing females to Gardens, flow beneath them rivers, abiders therein; and (so that) He may write-off from them their misdeeds. And became this, in the sight of Allah, a supreme gain"
  48,6,"And He may submit to torment the hypocrite males and the hypocrite females,and the polytheistic males and the polytheistic females who harbour thoughts against Allah — evil thoughts.
