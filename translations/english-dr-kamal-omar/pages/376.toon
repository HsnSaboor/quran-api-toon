quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,whatever they were being provided as provisions did not benefit them (at all)
  26,208,And We did not destroy a township but for it (were sent) warners —
  26,209,"by way of reminder, and We are not unjust"
  26,210,"And did not descend with it (i.e., for bringing down Al-Kitab) the devils"
  26,211,"And it does not (even) suit them, and they have no capacity (to do this job)"
  26,212,"Verily, they are indeed those who stand deprived from even listening (to it)"
  26,213,So invoke not alongwith Allah another ilah (god) lest you be among those who have been subjected to punishment
  26,214,"And warn your tribe, nearest kinsmen"
  26,215,And lower your wing (in mercy and forgiveness) for that who has followed you out of the Believers
  26,216,"Then if they disobeyed you, then say: “Surely, I am absolved of what you practice.”"
  26,217,"And put your trust in the All-Mighty, the continuously Merciful"
  26,218,Who marks you when you stand up (to lead the Prayers)
  26,219,and your changing postures among the Submitters
  26,220,"Verily! He, only He, is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower"
  26,221,Shall I inform you upon whom descend the devils
  26,222,"They descend on all those who are frequent liars, (and) continuous sinners"
  26,223,They transmit (without getting confirmed) what is heard and most of them are untrue in speech
  26,224,"As for the poets, (only) the erring ones follow them"
  26,225,have you not seen that they roam about in all the (imaginary) valleys (of thought)
  26,226,And that they utter what they do not practice
  26,227,"except those who have accepted Faith, and have performed righteous deeds and have glorified and propagated Allah exceedingly, and have done an effective rebut after they were made to face injustice. And soon will know those who have indulged in injustice as to what place of return they shall return. [The poets, writers, thinkers and historians indulge in injustice and need an effective rebuttal when they direct their onslaughts against Allah, Islam, Messengers, Islamic state and the ordainments and directives available in Al-Kitab]"
