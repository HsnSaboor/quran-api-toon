quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,29,"So when Musa completed the prescribed period and moved with his family, he perceived in the direction of the mount (something like) fire. He said to his family: “Wait, surely I have perceived a fire; may be, I come to you therefrom with a news or a burning brand from the fire, so that you may warm yourselves.”"
  28,30,"So when he reached it, he was called from the side of the blessed valley, within the auspicious platform, from the direction of the tree, informing him that: “O Musa! Verily, I, I am Allah, the Nourisher-Sustainer to the worlds.”"
  28,31,"And that: “Put down your rod!” But when he saw it: it moves as if it is a snake, he turned away showing his back and did not return. (Allah called him again): “O Musa! come closer and fear not. Verily, you are of those who have found peace and protection"
  28,32,"Put your hand in your bosom, it will come forth white without a disease, and draw your limb close to your side (as a preventive) from (becoming a cause of) fear. These are two credentials from your Nourisher-Sustainer unto Firaun and his chiefs. Verily, they have become a nation of rebellious and disobedients.”"
  28,33,"He said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! I have indeed killed (without intention) from amongst them a man, so I fear that they will kill me"
  28,34,"And my brother Harun — he is more eloquent, in comparison to me, in speech, so send him alongwith me as a help — he will verify and confirm me. Verily I, I fear that they will belie me.”"
  28,35,"(Allah) said: “Soon We will strengthen your arm through your brother and set for both of you a shield, so they shall not close-up to either of you. With Our Ayaat, you two and whoever followed you two will be the victors (i.e., those who prevail).”"
