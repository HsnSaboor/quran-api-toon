quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,30,"The Day every self finds, whatever she did out of the good (acts) made available; as well as whatever she did out of the bad (acts). (Then and there) she will wish, that (there be) between her and between it a distance, great. And Allah cautions you about His Self. And Allah is full of kindness to (His) Ibad"
  3,31,"Say: “If you do love Allah then follow me: Allah will love you and forgive for you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful.”"
  3,32,"Say: “Obey Allah and the Messenger.” Then if they turned away, then, certainly, Allah does not like the disbelievers"
  3,33,"Certainly Allah chose Adam, and Nuh and the followers of Ibrahim and the followers of Imran over the worlds"
  3,34,"offspring, some of that, out of some other. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower"
  3,35,"(Appreciate!) When the wife of Imran said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! I have vowed to You what is in my womb (to keep him) Moharrarun [one who is allowed freedom (from the clutches of sectarianism)]; so do accept from me. Certainly You, You are All-Hearer, All-Knower.”"
  3,36,"Then when she delivered that (what was in her womb) she said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Certainly I delivered that (as) a female (child),” — and Allah (is always) a Better Knower about what she delivered, and the male (child she had in her mind) would not have (fulfilled the role) the way the female (fulfilled); “and certainly I, I have given her the name, Maryam, and certainly I put her to protection, to You (O Allah,) and (also) her offspring against (the evil effects of) Satan, the outcast.”"
  3,37,"So her Benefactor accepted her, with a gracious acceptance. And He made her grow in a graceful growth and He placed her under the guardianship of Zakariyya. Every time Zakariyya entered Al-Mihrab to (meet) her, he found in her possession sustenance. He said: “O Maryam! From where, for you (is made available all) this?” She said: “It (has come) from the possession of Allah. Verily, Allah provides sustenance whom He thinks proper, without limit.”"
