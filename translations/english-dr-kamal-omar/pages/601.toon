quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,(Passage of) time (through the ages) acts as a witness
  103,2,"Verily, the human being is surely in loss"
  103,3,"except those who have developed Faith and performed righteous deeds, and indulged in mutual teaching with Al-Haqq; and mutually prescribed to one another steadfastness (patience and perseverance)"
  104,1,"Woe to every slanderer, backbiter"
  104,2,that who collected wealth and counted it
  104,3,"He thinks that his wealth made him last for ever. [‘made’ is the literal translation of the Arabic word. It stands for ‘would make’]"
  104,4,By no means! Indeed he will be cast in Al-Hutamatah
  104,5,And what made you realise what Al-Hutamatah is
  104,6,"(It is the) Fire of Allah, kindled"
  104,7,that which leaps over the hearts
  104,8,"Surely, it shall be closed in on them (and made to cover and envelop them completely)"
  104,9,in (the form of) columns outstretched
  105,1,Have you not noticed how your Nourisher-Sustainer dealt with the elephant-corps (the military contingent whose commander was on an elephant)
  105,2,Did He not make their planning go in disarray
  105,3,"And directed towards them birds, in formation"
  105,4,"(The birds) shoot them with stones out of sijjil [fully recorded (stock]"
  105,5,So (Allah) transformed them (into something) like fodder subjected to rumination
