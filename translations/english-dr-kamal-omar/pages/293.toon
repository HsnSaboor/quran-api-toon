quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,105,And We have delivered it in original and it has descended in original. And We have not sent you except as a bearer of glad tidings and as a warner
  17,106,"And (it is a) Quran which We (as an Author or Source) have divided (into Surahs and statements), in order that you might recite it to mankind in stages. And We have sent it as a descent (from the Nourisher--Sustainer. Please see Verse)"
  17,107,"Say: “You may Believe in it or you may not Believe (in it): verily, those people who were bestowed Al-Ilm (‘The Knowledge’) before this (Re-revelation), when it is reproduced to them, they fall down, in the direction of their chins, prostrating"
  17,108,"And they say: “Glory be to Our Nourisher-Sustainer, while the promise of our Nourisher-Sustainer became, indeed, fulfilled"
  17,109,"And they fall down in direction of (their) chins weeping and it (i.e., the re-revelation of the original Al-Kitab ) increases them in humility and devotion"
  17,110,"Say: “Invoke Allah, or invoke Rahman, through whichever (Name) you invoke — so all the excellent attributes are restricted for Him (Alone).\" And don’t be loud in your Salat (Prayer) and do not be low with (it in voice), but adopt an approach between these (two extremes)"
  17,111,"And say: “Specific Praise is restricted to Allah Who has not begotten a son, and (one) does not become to Him a partner in (His) Dominion; and (one) does not become to Him a helper because of (His non-existent) weakness, and magnify Him in magnificence and majesty"
  18,1,Selective Praise suits Allah (Alone) Who has delivered to His Abd (subservient) Al-Kitab and did not allow thereto any crookedness
  18,2,"(Allah has made it) Qayyim [one that keeps established (the Religion that emanates from Him)] so that He may warn of a severe punishment from Him, and give glad tidings to the Believers who work righteous deeds, that for them is an excellent reward (in Paradise) —"
  18,3,dwellers therein forever
  18,4,"And He may warn those who said:\"Allah has begotten a son.\" [All the Prophets propagated Allah’s Book in original. Their followers after them broke up Religion and deformed its teachings. They prepared man-written books to propagate their perverted beliefs and deeds, and created sects. Some sects of the pre-Muhammad era like Jews and Christians etc. and some appearing in post-Muhammad era have exalted some specified humans to the ‘son of God’ position]"
