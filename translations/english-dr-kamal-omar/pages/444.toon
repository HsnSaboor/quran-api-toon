quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  36,55,"Verily, the dwellers of the Garden, this Day, are those who feel joy in (any) activity (they indulge in)"
  36,56,They and their consorts are in shades — (as) recliners on raised couches
  36,57,"For them therein are fruits, and for them (is available) whatever they call for"
  36,58,"Salamun [peace and blessings (be on you, will be the greeting)] — statement from the continuously Merciful, Nourisher-Sustainer"
  36,59,“O you Al-Mujrimun! Get you apart this Day (and do not approach or come close to the pious Believers).”
  36,60,"Don’t I make a covenant with you, O Bani-Adam, that you must not obey Satan. Surely, he is an evident enemy unto you"
  36,61,and that you must obey Me (Alone). This is a Permanent Path
  36,62,"And surely, indeed he (i.e., Satan) did lead astray numerous groups from amongst you. Would you then not use (your) intellect"
  36,63,This is Hell which had been promised
  36,64,Slide therein this Day because you used to disbelieve
  36,65,"This Day, We shall put a seal (of closure) over their mouths; and their hands will speak to us, and their lower limbs will bear witness of what they used to earn"
  36,66,"And if We think proper We would have surely wiped out over their eyes (the power to see), so that they would have rushed to (find) the way. But how would they see"
  36,67,"And if We think proper, We could have surely made them paralysed at their places — then they had no ability for moving about and (then) they will not return"
  36,68,"And whoever We grant long life, We do revert him in creation (towards his initial weak state). Will they not then use intellect"
  36,69,"And We have not taught him poetry, nor does that suit it (‘it’ refers to Al-Kitab). It is not but Zikr (Message) and Quranum-Mobin"
  36,70,so that it may warn him who happened to be alive and the statement (about punishment) becomes justified against the disbelievers
