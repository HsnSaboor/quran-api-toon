  26,1,S. M
  26,2,"These (alphabets in the starting Verse are) signs of Al-Kitab-ul-Mobin (The Evident, Clear and Manifest Scripture)"
  26,3,Perhaps you are becoming one who keeps his Nafs (self) in grief and anxiety that the people do not revert as Believers (to the Book of Allah)
  26,4,If We thought proper We could send unto them from the heaven a Sign so their necks instantly bent under its effect as (of) those who are in humility and submission
  26,5,"And there comes not to them Zikr (Message) from Ar-Rahman anew but they became unto it (as) those who keep themselves at a distance and do not attempt to listen, understand and adopt (Al-Kitab)"
  26,6,"So indeed they have denied. So, very soon shall come the news of what they mock (at)"
  26,7,And have they not seen towards the earth how many We caused to grow therein out of all kinds of palatable (growths)
  26,8,"Verily, in this is surely Aayatan (a proof, sign or a lesson), yet most of them are not Believers"
  26,9,"And verily, your Nourisher-Sustainer: truly He is the All-Mighty, the continuously Merciful"
  26,10,"And (bring to mind) when your Nourisher-Sustainer called Musa (saying): “Proceed to the nation of transgressors —"
  26,11,the nation of Firaun. Will they not pay obedience (to Allah)?”
  26,12,"(Musa) said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Verily, I fear that they will belie me"
  26,13,and my chest constricts and my tongue does not speak fluently. So send (Your Inspirations) to Harun (to accompany me as a Messenger)
  26,14,"And they have a charge of crime against me, whereof I fear that they will kill me.”"
  26,15,"(Allah) said: “Certainly never! Go you both with Ayaatina (Our Signs). Verily, We shall be with you (as) Listeners"
  26,16,"Then proceed both of you to Firaun, then both of you say: ‘Surely, we are 'Messenger from the Nourisher-Sustainer of the worlds"
  26,17,that you send Bani Israiel with us (as a free people desiring to emigrate)
  26,18,"(Firaun) said: “Did we not bring you up among us as a child? And you did stay many years of your life with us"
  26,19,"And you did your deed, which you did. And you are of the ungrateful.”"
