quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  42,32,And among His Credentials are the ships in the sea like mountains
  42,33,"If He thinks proper He causes the wind to cease (its motion), then the ships become those who are without motion on its surface. Surely, in this are indeed signs for all the patient and grateful individuals"
  42,34,"or He explodes or breaks them up because of what they earned, although He overlooks and pardons numerous (of the errors and deviations committed by His Ibad)"
  42,35,And (Allah) knows those people who argue and make disputes against Ayaatina; (there is) not for them out of a place of escape
  42,36,"So whatever you have been provided in the form of anything, then it is a passing enjoyment for this worldly life; and whatever is available with Allah (in the Hereafter,) is better and more lasting for those who have Believed and in their Nourisher-Sustainer they put their trust"
  42,37,"and those who avoid the more grievous sins and Al-Fawahish, and when they became angry, (they do not lose temper but rather) they pardon and forgive"
  42,38,"and those who responded to their Nourisher-Sustainer, and they established Salat, and their affairs are handled through mutual consultation amongst them, and of what We have provided them as provisions, they spend (in accordance with the recommendations and priorities set in Allah’s Scripture)"
  42,39,"and those who, when an oppressive and aggressive wrong is done to them, they do take revenge"
  42,40,"And a recompense for an evil is an evil similar to it, but whoever overlooked and forgave and made a reform or correction, then his reward is due from Allah. Verily, He likes not the transgressors"
  42,41,"And surely, whoever took revenge after an injustice done to him, then those people — there is not against them any way (of blame or condemnation)"
  42,42,"Certainly, what (is a fact is that) the way (of blame) is against those who commit wrong against people, and rebel (against the law in Al-Kitab) on the earth without (any) right. Those people: for them is a painful torment"
  42,43,"And truly whoever remained patient and pardoned, certainly this (attitude is) surely out of great will-power for handling affairs"
  42,44,"And whomsoever Allah allows to go astray, then (there is) not unto him out of a wali after Him. And you will notice the transgressors as and when they saw the Punishment — they will say: “Is there any wayout for tahead of state a return (to the worldly life)?”"
