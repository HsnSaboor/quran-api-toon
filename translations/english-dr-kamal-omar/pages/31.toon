quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,197,"The Hajj (is in the) well known (last three) months (of the lunar year). So one who makes therein Hajj compulsory on himself — then during Hajj there shall be no Rafus (indulging in sex), and no Fusuq (acts of wickedness and disobedience) and no Jidal (involvement in disputes, arguments or fights). And whatever good you do, Allah knows it, and do take a provision (for the Hajj-journey) and verily, the best of provision is At-Taqwa. And pay obedience to Me, O men of understanding"
  2,198,"There is no blame on you that (while you are attending the Hajj) you may seek (trade) benefits from your Nourisher-Sustainer. So when you have come back from Arafat, glorify Allah at the Mashar-al-Haram. And do glorify Him as He has directed you, and verily, you were, before this, definitely out of those who had lost the track"
  2,199,"Then return from the same (route) as people returned and ask forgiveness from Allah. Verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Continuously Merciful"
  2,200,"So when you have completed your Manasik (Religious Rites), glorify Allah as your glorification regarding your fore fathers, or even more powerful glorification. So there is amongst mankind who says: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Give us in this immediate world!” And for him is no share in the Hereafter"
  2,201,"And amongst them is the one who says: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Give us good in this immediate world and good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the punishment of Fire"
  2,202,"Those people: for them is a share from what they have earned and Allah is swift in accountability"
