quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  27,89,"Whoever approached with a good deed, then for him is better than that and they will be feeling safe from the terror on that Day"
  27,90,"And whoever approached with sin and evil then their faces (personalities) got cast down into the Fire (of Hell, and it was said to them):\" Would you be recompensed (with something else) except what you used to do?”"
  27,91,"Surely, what (is a fact is that) I have been commanded that I may pay obedience to the Nourisher-Sustainer of this Township Who has made it a Harem [a protected, prohibited (to polytheists), and an honoured area]; and all things belong to Him. And I have been commanded that I be of the Muslims"
  27,92,"And that I may read, understand, adopt and propagate Al-Quran. So whosoever received guidance, so surely what (is a fact is that) he receives guidance for his ownself; and whosoever went astray, then say (to them): “Surely what (is a fact is that) I am out of the warners.”"
  27,93,"And say: “Selective Praise suits Allah (Alone). Soon He will show you His Signs, so you shall recognise them. And your Nourisher-Sustainer is not unaware of what you do.”"
  28,1,S. M
  28,2,These (alphabets are) Signs of Al-Kitab-ul-Mobin
  28,3,We recite unto you (something) out of the news of Musa and Firaun in original truth in the interest of a nation who Believe
  28,4,"Verily, Firaun exhibited, declared and set himself as high, superior and exalted on the earth, and turned its people (into) sects. He weakens a group amongst them (who were regarded Muslims), he slaughters their sons and lets their females survive. Surely, he was of the Mufsidun"
  28,5,And (on the other hand) We wish that We may do special favour unto those who have been made weak in the land and We make them aimma (imams) and we set them as the inheritors (of the state)
