  21,36,"And when those who have disbelieved saw you, they do not behave with you except in jest and mockery (saying): 'Is this the one who discusses your gods?' And they at the mention of Ar-Rahman, behave as if they are those who do not Believe"
  21,37,"Human being has been created of haste (i.e., haste is enshrined in human-nature). Soon, I will show you people My Signs. So do not make haste with Me"
