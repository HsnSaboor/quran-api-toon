quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,"And that He created two kinds, male and female"
  53,46,from Nutfah when it is emitted
  53,47,And that on Him is the responsibility for another creation
  53,48,"And that He, He gave abundant wealth, and He made content (in possessions strictly according to needs)"
  53,49,"And that He, He is the Rabb of Ash-Shera (mighty star, Sirius)"
  53,50,And that He annihilated the initial (tribes of) ’Ad (people)
  53,51,and Samud (people). So He spared (none of the transgressing individuals)
  53,52,"and the nation of Nuh aforetime. Surely, they used to be, they — more unjust and more rebellious"
  53,53,"and that which remained involved in falsehood, He destroyed (them to extinction)"
  53,54,So enveloped that whatever enveloped (as a wrath and torment coming from Allah)
  53,55,Then about what signs of your Nourisher-Sustainer you will argue or dispute
  53,56,"This (Al-Kitab) is Nazeer [‘Warner’ (coming)] out of the Nuzur (Warners) of the previous times"
  53,57,"The approaching one (i.e., the Day of Resurrection) has approached very near"
  53,58,There is not for it one who could delay or stop besides Allah
  53,59,Do you then wonder at this Al-Hadees
  53,60,"And you laugh, and you weep not"
  53,61,and you are those who remain proudly heedless
  53,62,"So submit to Allah, and pay obedience"
  54,1,The Hour has come very close and the moon has developed cracks
  54,2,"And if they will witness a sign, they will avoid and will say: “(This is) sorcery which continues to occur.”"
  54,3,And (this response would be because) they have denied (Al-Kitab) and have obeyed their vain desires. And every matter has a specified time and place (for occurance)
  54,4,"And surely, indeed there came to them of the news, that, wherein (is) a strictly warned personality"
  54,5,(The news is full of) wisdom about to penetrate (the heart) but warnings profit (them) not
  54,6,So withdraw from them. The Day the caller calls to an undesirable event
