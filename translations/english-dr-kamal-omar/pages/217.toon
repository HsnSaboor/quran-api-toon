quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,71,"And reproduce before them the news of Nuh when he said to his nation: “O my nation! If it came very hard on you: my presence and my missionary pursuit with the help of Ayaatillahe, then in Allah I have put my trust. So bring together your stratagem and your accomplices; then your conspiracy should not remain unto you ill-defined, then pronounce your sentence against me and do not give me respite"
  10,72,"So if you have turned away (from the Message of Allah in His Al-Kitab) then (do realise) I have not asked you for any reward. My reward is not (due on anyone) except on Allah, and I have been commanded that I may become out of the Muslims.”"
  10,73,So they denied him. So We delivered him and those with him in the Ark and We appointed them as the successor-generations (who inherited the earth) while We drowned (in the great deluge all) those who belied Our Ayaat. Then ponder how was the final end of those who were warned
  10,74,"Then We raised after him Messengers over the (future) nation of these people, so they came to them with Al-Bayyinat, but they would not Believe what they had already rejected beforehand. Thus We put up a seal on the hearts of those who break the limits"
  10,75,Then We raised after them Musa and Harun to Firaun and his chiefs with Our Signs. But they behaved arrogantly and they happened to be a nation of criminals
  10,76,"So when came to them Al-Haqq from Us, they said: “Without doubt, this is surely magic, fully manifest.”"
  10,77,"Musa said: “Do you say about Al-Haqq when it has reached you: Is this magic? But the magicians never succeed.”"
  10,78,"They said: “Have you come to us to deviate us from that we found following it our fathers; and you desire that the greatness (and position) in the land becomes restricted to you two? And we are not (becoming) Believers for you two.”"
