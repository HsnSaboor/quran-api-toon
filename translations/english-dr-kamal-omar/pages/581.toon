  77,25,Have We not made the earth as a den of storage —
  77,26,"for the living ones, and the dead ones"
  77,27,"And We placed therein mountains firmly fixed and rising high. And We made you drink water, sweet and palatable"

  77,36,and nor permission shall be granted unto them so that they may bring some excuse
  77,37,Woe that Day to the deniers
  77,38,This is the Day of Decision (Youmul Fasl); We have collected you (altogether) as well as the initial people (alongwith you)
  77,39,"So if a plot became (of some benefit) for you, then prepare against Me"
  77,40,Woe that Day to the deniers
  77,41,"Verily, Al-Muttaqun shall be amidst shades and springs"
  77,42,and fruits out of that which they may desire
  77,43,Eat and drink in happiness and joy because of what you had been doing (in your worldly life)
