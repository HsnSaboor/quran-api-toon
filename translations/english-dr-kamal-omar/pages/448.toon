  37,52,"he would (frequently) say (to me): 'are you surely, indeed of those who confirm and verify"
  37,53,"Whether when we have faced death and we have become dust and bones, would surely we will indeed be those who have been fully recompensed (of their deeds)?'”"
  37,54,"(The other one) said: “Would you like to be those who would peep and see?”"
  37,55,So he peeped and saw; so he saw him in the midst of the Fire
  37,56,"He said: “Allah is Witness, if you could, you would have surely ruined me"
  37,57,"And if (there was) not the Grace of my Nourisher-Sustainer, I would certainly have been among those who have been brought forth (to the midst of Fire)"

  37,75,"And surely, indeed Nuh invoked Us, so surely (We are) the Best — those who answer (the request)"
  37,76,And We rescued him and his followers from the great distress
