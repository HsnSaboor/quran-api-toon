quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,187,"And (remember) when Allah took a covenant from those who were given Al-Kitab that: ‘you must make it evident to mankind and do not hide it’; then they threw it away behind their backs and purchased thereby a meagre sum. Then evil (it is) which they purchase"
  3,188,"Do not think about those who rejoice about what they brought with (themselves) and they (also) love that they may be praised for that which they have not done — so regard them not as ‘rescued from the punishment’. And, for them, (is) a painful punishment"
  3,189,And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is All-Capable over all things
  3,190,"Verily! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alteration of night and day, (there are) indeed signs for people of understanding"
  3,191,"Those who transmit (the Message of) Allah, standing, sitting and (lying down) on their sides and ponder in the creation of the heavens and the earth, (saying): “Our Nourisher-Sustainer! You have not created (all) this without purpose, glory to You! So save us from the torment of Fire"
  3,192,"Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Verily You! Whom You admit to the Fire, so indeed You have disgraced him. And there is not (available) for the transgressors (any one) out of the helpers"
  3,193,"Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Verily, we heard a preacher. He gives a call towards Faith: ‘That you should develop Belief in your Nourisher-Sustainer,’ so we have developed Faith. Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Now forgive us our sins and write off from us our evil deeds, and give us death in company of Al-Abrar"
  3,194,"Our Nourisher-Sustainer! And grant us what you promised unto us through Your Messengers, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. Surely, You do not go against (Your) Promise.”"
