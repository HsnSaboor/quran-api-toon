  20,38,When We sent revelation to your mother — whatever was (to be) revealed
  20,39,"that, ‘set him in the Tabut (a floating device in the form of a basket, box, case, chest or an ark), then place it on the waters, then the waters shall cast it up on the bank, (and there) an enemy of Mine and an enemy of yours shall take him.’ And I poured on you love from Me that you may be brought up on My Eye (under extra-ordinary Love and Mercy proceeding from Me)"
  20,40,"When your sister walks (along, following your sailing through the waters) and says (to the people who have picked you up from the banks of the waters and they are not becoming successful in mahead of state you feed on a breast): “Shall I show you one who may look after him (and also feed him on her breast)?” So We restored you to your mother, that she might cool her eye and she might not stay in grief. And you killed a man (by mistake, without intention) so We saved you from (its) stress. And We put you to test in extreme trial. Then you stayed a number of years with the citizens of Madyan (Midian). Thereafter you reached the set-standard, O Musa"
