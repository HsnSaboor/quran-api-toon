quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,"Verily, those who do not believe in the Hereafter, surely allot names to the angels (like) allotting the name to a daughter —"
  53,28,"although there is not for them regarding this (aspect of the angels) anything of knowledge. They do not follow but conjecture. And surely, conjecture does not make one unconcerned of Al-Haqq to any extent (i.e., a guess work is no substitute for ‘The Truth’)"
  53,29,"Therefore withdraw from that who turned away from Our Zikr (‘Message’), and desires not except the life of this world"
  53,30,"That (becomes) the ultimate aim for them from the knowledge. Verily, your Nourisher-Sustainer — He knows more about that who strayed from His Way; and He knows more about that who received guidance"
  53,31,"And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens, and whatever is in the earth, so that He may recompense those who did evil with what they did, and reward with excellence those who did good —"
  53,32,"those who abstain from serious types of Al-Ism (the sins) and Al-Fawahish (the obscenes) except the small faults (which could be overlooked): verily, your Nourisher-Sustainer is Most Vast regarding forgiveness. He knows more of you when He initiated you from within the earth; and when you (remain) hidden and unrecognisable ones (i.e., as foetuses and embryos) within the bellies of your mothers. So ascribe not purity to yourselves. He knows better that (person) who has remained obedient"
  53,33,Did you then observe that who turned away
  53,34,and spent a little and (then) stopped
  53,35,Is with him knowledge about the unseen so that he sees
  53,36,Or has he not been informed with what is in Suhuf-e-Musa
  53,37,and Ibrahim who fulfilled (whatever he was commanded by Allah as a test or as an ordainment)
  53,38,That a burdened person shall not bear the burden of another one
  53,39,and that (there is) not (available) to a human being except what he strove (for)
  53,40,and that his effort would soon be examined
  53,41,then he would be recompensed with a complete and full recompense
  53,42,and that to your Nourisher-Sustainer is the ultimate border (limit and source)
  53,43,"And that He, He made (one) laugh and He made (one) weep"
  53,44,"And that He, He caused death and He gave life"
