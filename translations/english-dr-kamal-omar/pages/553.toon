quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  62,1,"Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah, — the Sovereign, the Holy One, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise"
  62,2,"He it is Who raised amongst Al-Ummiyyun a Messenger from among themselves. He reproduces unto them His Ayaat, and he purifies them, and he teaches the knowledge of Al-Kitab and Al-Hikmah even if they remained in manifest error before"
  62,3,"and the other ones in relation to them who have not already joined them and He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise"
  62,4,That is the Grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He thinks proper. And Allah is the Possessor of Supreme Bounty
  62,5,The likeness of those who were entrusted At-Taurat then they did not hold it with responsibility is the likeness of an ass who carries huge burdens of books. Bad (is the) example of the nation of those who denied Ayaatullah. And Allah does not guide the nation of transgressors
  62,6,"Say: “O you people who Haadoo (have adopted Judaism)! If you stressed that you are auliya of Allah to the exclusion of mankind, then wish for death if you are those who speak the truth.”"
  62,7,And they will not long for that (death) ever because of what their hands have sent in advance. And Allah is All-Aware of the transgressors
  62,8,"Say: “Verily, the death from which you flee, so surely it is something which must meet you; then you will be sent back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, then He will inform you about what you used to practice.”"
