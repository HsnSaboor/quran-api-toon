quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  35,19,And the blind and the seer do not become equal
  35,20,"and nor different darknesses (in degree), and (similarly) nor the Light (of different categories)"
  35,21,and nor the shade (of different natures) and nor the (sun’s) heat (of different seasons)
  35,22,"And do not become equal the (different categories of) living ones, and nor the (different categories of) dead ones. Verily, Allah makes (him) hear whom He thinks proper. And you are not ‘one who makes one hear’ unto that who are in graves"
  35,23,You are not but (only) a warner
  35,24,"Verily, We have sent you with Al-Haqq (‘The Truth’ or ‘The Original’), as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner. And (there was) not out of a nation but there did stay, among that, a warner"
  35,25,"And if they belie you, so, surely belied those (also who went) before them. Their Messengers came to them with Al-Bayyinat, and with Az-Zubur and with Al-Kitab-ul-Monir (‘The Light Emitting Book’)"
  35,26,"Then I seized them who disbelieved, so how terrible became the final result of My denial"
  35,27,"Have not you seen that Allah sent down from towards the sky, water? Then We brought forth therewith fruits — their colours (are) of different variety. And of the mountains are tracts (or streaks) white and red — their shades (are) different, and also intensely dark, black ones"
  35,28,"And of humans, and ad-dawab and cattle — their colours (are) different (created) similarly. Surely, what (is a fact is that) the erudite (very learned ones) out of His Ibad fear (and remain conscious and mindful of) Allah. Verily, Allah is All-Mighty, Oft-Forgiving"
  35,29,"Verily, those who read, study and adopt Kitabullah (Book of Allah) and they established As-Salat, and spent out of what We gave them as provision, secretly and openly, hope for a commerce (or trade and business) that never perishes"
  35,30,"that He may pay them their wages in full and (even) increase for them out of His bounty. Certainly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate"
