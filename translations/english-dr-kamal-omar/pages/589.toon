quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,On sofas they shall (recline and) watch (the delights in Paradise)
  83,36,Have the disbelievers been paid fully what they used to do
  84,1,When the heaven developed cracks
  84,2,"And it gave ear (i.e., listened) to its Nourisher-Sustainer, and (thus) it was proved true (to Allah’s Command)"
  84,3,And when the earth was expanded enough
  84,4,"and it cast out what (had been) therein, and became empty"
  84,5,"And it gave ear to its Nourisher-Sustainer, and (thus) it was proved true"
  84,6,"O you the human being! Surely, you are (the) one striving towards your Nourisher-Sustainer — a hard effort, then (you are the one) who must meet Him"
  84,7,Then as for him who is given his record from his right (side)
  84,8,then soon he is put to Accountability — a very easy reckoning
  84,9,And he returns to his followers in joy
  84,10,And as for him who is given his record from behind his back
  84,11,so soon he will seek destruction (so that he may become destroyed rather than stay in a lasting punishment)
  84,12,And he shall enter the blazing Fire
  84,13,"Verily, he was among his family fully involved in joy and amusement"
  84,14,"Verily, he thought that he will never return (to Allah)"
  84,15,"Yes! Verily, his Nourisher-Sustainer remained a Strict Watch over him (throughout his worldly span of life)"
  84,16,So beware! I bring to witness the heaven in evening twilight
  84,17,and (I bring to witness) the night and whatever it enveloped and hid
  84,18,"and (I bring to witness) the moon when it became fully felt and known (i.e., it revealed its secrets to man)"
  84,19,Without doubt you would surely embark (for journey) from one field to another field (of influence of a heavenly body)
  84,20,So what (is the matter) with them that they Believe not
  84,21,And when is recited unto them Al-Quran they do not submit
  84,22,"Nay, (on the contrary) those who have disbelieved, they belie (the contents of the Book)"
  84,23,And Allah knows better what they amass
  84,24,So announce to them ‘the good news’ about a painful torment —
  84,25,"save those who have Believed and performed righteous deeds — for them is a reward, not stopped or interrupted"
