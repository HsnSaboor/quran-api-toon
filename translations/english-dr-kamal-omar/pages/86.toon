quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,45,"And Allah knows better your enemies, and Allah being a Wali (One Who assists) completely suffices (you) and Allah being a Helper completely suffices (you)"
  4,46,"Among those who Haadoo (became Jews): they displace a word from its places and they say: “We have listened and we have disobeyed;” and “Hear (but) without (behaving) as a listener.” And they uttered the word Raina (giving it) a twist with their tongues (to change its pronunciation to an objectionable meaning) and (thus committing) mockery in Religion. And if they had said: ‘we have heard and we have obeyed’ and ‘hear and unzurna — definitely it would have been better for them and more effective (in meaning): but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they have no Faith, except a minority (among them)"
  4,47,"O you people who were given Al-Kitab!

And the commandment of Allah got fulfilled (and this led to the appearance of ‘human apes’ and ‘human pigs’ as a permanent admonition)"

  4,49,"Have you not seen towards those people who claim sanctity for their selves? Nay, only Allah sanctifies whom He thinks proper. And they will not be dealt with injustice even to the extent of a Fatila (scalish thread in the long slit of a date-seed)"
  4,50,"Look, how they forge against Allah a lie. And due to this it became enough (to be counted as a) manifest sin"
  4,51,"Have you not seen towards those who were given a portion of Al-Kitab? They develop faith in Jibt and Taghut (meaning all those, whether imaginary or real, who forge religious beliefs, customs, festivals, practices and rituals which are outside Allah’s Book) and say, concerning the disbelievers, they are better guided to the Path than those who have Believed"
