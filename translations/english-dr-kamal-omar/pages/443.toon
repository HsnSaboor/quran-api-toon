  36,42,and We have created for them the like thereof whereon they ride
  36,43,"And if We think proper We drown them, then there is no cry for help available to them, and they will not be rescued —"
  36,44,"except as a mercy from Us, and as an enjoyment for a limited period"
  36,45,"And when it was said to them: “Guard (yourselves against) that which is in between your hands and that which is behind you, in order that you: you may receive mercy.”"
