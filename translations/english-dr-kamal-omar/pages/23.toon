quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,146,"Those whom We gave Al-Kitab, recognise it as they recognise their sons. And certainly a group among them clearly conceal the truth while they know"
  2,147,"Al-Haqq from your Nourisher-Sustainer, so be not of those who doubt"
  2,148,"And to every one (is a) ‘site of attention,’ he being one who turns to it. So vie with one another in good works. Wheresoever you may be, Allah will bring you altogether. Truly Allah is All-Powerful for every thing"
  2,149,"And from wheresoever you have come out, turn your face (to the) Nucleus of Al-Masjid-al-Haram. And that indeed is the original truth from your Nourisher-Sustainer. And Allah is not unaware of what you do"
  2,150,"And from wheresoever you start forth, turn your face (to the) Nucleus of Al-Masjid-al-Haram. And wheresoever you are, do turn your faces (towards) its nucleus so that there be no ground with the people against you except those of them who committed transgression. So pay no allegiance to them and pay allegiance to Me; and that I may complete My grace on you and perchance you may be guided"
  2,151,Similarly We have sent among you a Messenger of your own. He recites to you Our Ayaat and sanctifies you and teaches you Al-Kitab and Al-Hikmah and gives you knowledge which you were not knowing
  2,152,"Then be mindful of Me, I will be attentive to you; and be grateful to Me and do not blaspheme Me"
  2,153,O you people who have Believed! Invoke assistance with patience and Salat. Indeed Allah is with those who patiently persevere
