quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and turned away
  80,2,that there came unto him a blind person
  80,3,"And what shall make you realise, perchance he might become pure (of sins)"
  80,4,or he might take heed and Az-Zikrah (‘The Reminder’) may benefit him
  80,5,"Then whatever (may be the case), that who became disdainfully indifferent"
  80,6,"then you, in his interest, you wait"
  80,7,And what (responsibility falls) on you that he is not becoming pure (of sins)
  80,8,"And that whoever (may be the case) — one who has come: he strives earnestly"
  80,9,and he becomes conscious of the position (of Allah)
  80,10,"then you regarding him: you show neglect"
  80,11,"By no means (We allow this behaviour)! Surely, it is Tazkirah (‘An Admonition’)"
  80,12,"So whoever desired, he propagated it (to himself and to others)"
  80,13,(The Scripture is contained) in Suhuf (Surahs or Booklets) Mukarramah (held in honour)
  80,14,"exalted (in dignity), kept pure (from interpolation)"
  80,15,in the hands of scribes
  80,16,noble (and) virtuous
  80,17,The human has been condemned (because of) that which has made him a denier (of Allah’s Message)
  80,18,From what material did He create him
  80,19,From Nutfah He created him; (and) then He set him in due proportion
  80,20,"Afterwards, the Path — He made (it) easy unto him"
  80,21,Then He caused him to die; then He placed him in (his) burial place
  80,22,"Then, when He willed — He resurrected him"
  80,23,Nay! Not yet he has completed what He commanded him
  80,24,Then let the human being look towards his food
  80,25,that We poured down water in a downpour
  80,26,Then We split the earth in clefts
  80,27,Then We caused to grow therein the grain
  80,28,"and grapes, and clover-grass (as pasture)"
  80,29,"and olives, and date-palms"
  80,30,and gardens — dense in growth
  80,31,"and fruits, and Abba (herbage or fodder)"
  80,32,(to be) a provision for you people and for your cattle
  80,33,And when the deafening sound (from the blowing Trumpet) stands delivered —
  80,34,the Day a man flees from his brother
  80,35,"and his mother, and his father"
  80,36,"and his wife, and his offsprings"
  80,37,"For each and every man of them that Day is a concern which makes him indifferent (to all, except himself)"
  80,38,(Some) faces this Day (would be) happily shining ones
  80,39,"smiling ones, rejoicing ones while receiving the good news"
  80,40,And (some) faces this Day — on them is stain of dust and smoke
  80,41,darkness of despair shall cover them
  80,42,"Those people: they very ones are Al-Kafarah (the disbelievers), Al-Fajarah (the evil-doers)"
