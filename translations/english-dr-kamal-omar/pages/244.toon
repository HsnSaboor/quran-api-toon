quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  12,70,"So at length when (Yusuf) had furnished them forth with their rations, he put the drinhead of state-cup in the shopping bag of his brother. Later on an announcer announced: “O you in the caravan, surely you are indeed thieves.”"
  12,71,"(The brethren) said while they came closer to them (i.e., to the staff-members): “What is that which you misplace and (then) search?”"
  12,72,"They said: “We misplace and search the drinhead of state-cup of the head of state; and for him who comes with it (is the reward of) a camel-load.” (Now Yusuf himself said): “And I am that who gives a surety for this (reward).”"
  12,73,"(The brethren) said: “Allah be Witness! Indeed, you people knew that we have not come that we make mischief in the land, and we are not thieves.”"
  12,74,"They (Yusuf’s men) said: “So what should be the punishment for that (theft) if you are (proved to be) liars?”"
  12,75,"They (the brethren) said: “The punishment for it — he in whose shopping bag it is found, so he is (the) ransome for it . Thus we punish the wrong-doers.”"
  12,76,"So, (Yusuf) began (the search) through their bags before the bag of his (real) brother. Then he brought it out of his brother's bag. Thus did We plan for Yusuf. (It) was not (possible for Yusuf) that he may detain his brother under the law (and constitution) of Al-Malik, except when Allah wills it. We raise in ranks whom We think proper. And over all those endued with knowledge is the All-Knowing (Allah)"
  12,77,"(Half-brothers together) said: “If he steals, so without doubt did steal a brother-german to him, before.” So Yusuf kept it (i.e., the emotional reaction to this false charge) hidden in himself and he did not make it evident before them; (and only) said: \"You people are in a dangerous form, and Allah knows better what you allege.”"
  12,78,"They said: “O you Al-Aziz! Verily, for him (is his) father, a very, very old man, so detain one of us in his place. Indeed we: we see you out of those who do righteousness in perfection.”"
