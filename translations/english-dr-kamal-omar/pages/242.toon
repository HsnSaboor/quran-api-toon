quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  12,53,"And I (as a woman) absolve not myself (from the blame). Verily, the (human) self is the one who repeatedly whispers (commands) for evil, except what (protection) my Nourisher-Sustainer bestowed in mercy. Verily, my Nourisher-Sustainer is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful.”"
  12,54,"And Al-Malik (after completing the enquiry, finally) said, “Come to me with him. I will keep him exclusively attached to my person.” So when (Yusuf) talked to him (the head of state) said: “Verily, this day you are with us, established (in high rank and position, and) fully trusted.”"
  12,55,"(Yusuf) said: “Set me over the Khazain (treasures, store houses and finances) of the country. Verily, I (will prove myself as) ever-guarding, ever-knowing.”"
  12,56,And thus We established (vast authority) for Yusuf in the country. He stays and moves therein as and when he likes. We reach with Our mercy on whom We think proper and We do not allow to go waste the reward of those who do righteousness in perfection
  12,57,"And indeed, the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who have Believed and used to pay obedience (to Allah through the teachings in Al-Kitâb)"
  12,58,"And Yusuf’s brethren came and they entered unto him. So he recognised them but they, regarding him, were those who recognised (him) not"
  12,59,"And when (Yusuf through his subordinate staff) furnished them forth with the rations due to them, (in accordance with the details of the family-members as provided by the brethren), he said: “Come to me with the brother of yours, from your father. Do you not see that I give you full measure and that I am of the best of hosts"
  12,60,"But if you do not come to me with him, then there shall be no measure (of corn) for you with me, nor shall you come near me.”"
  12,61,"They said: “Soon we shall make his father to part with him. And surely, we are indeed about to do (it).”"
  12,62,"And (Yusuf) asked his staff-members: “Put back their money (which has been charged for the ration-supplied) into their shopping bags, so that they might recognise it when they go back to their family-members, in order that they might return back (to us).”"
  12,63,"So when they returned to their father, they said: “O our father! (Bringing in) measure (of corn) has been banned to us (unless our half-brother from you accompanies us), so send with us our brother, (only then) we get our measure, and indeed we, for him, will surely be protectors.”"
