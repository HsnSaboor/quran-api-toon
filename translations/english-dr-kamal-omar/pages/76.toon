quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,195,"So responded to them their Nourisher-Sustainer: Certainly I, I will not allow to go waste the work of a worker from amongst you, from amongst male or female. Some of you (are) from some (others). So those who emigrated and were driven out of their homes, and have been persecuted in My Cause, and they indulged in war and were killed, surely I will write off from them their omissions and would surely admit them into Gardens, flow under them rivers — a reward from the Presence of Allah. And Allah! With Him (is found) the excellence of reward"
  3,196,Must not provide a misunderstanding to you the arrogant movements in the cities of the people who have disbelieved
  3,197,"(This is just) a brief enjoyment, then their (ultimate) abode is Hell, and a bad resting place"
  3,198,"But those who remained mindful of their Nourisher-Sustainer, for them are gardens, flow under them rivers. (They are) dwellers therein — a reception from the presence of Allah. And whatever is with Allah is the best for Al-Abrar"
  3,199,"And certainly, among the people of Al-Kitab is that who Believes in Allah and ‘what has been delivered towards you and what is delivered towards them ’, having full regard of submission to Allah. They do not purchase at the cost of Ayaat of Allah a meagre sum. Those people: for them, their reward is with their Nourisher-Sustainer. Surely, Allah is swift in accountability"
  3,200,"O you people who have Believed, show steadfastness individually, and show steadfastness in group and guard the territory by stationing military units at vulnerable places, and be mindful of Allah so that you attain success"
