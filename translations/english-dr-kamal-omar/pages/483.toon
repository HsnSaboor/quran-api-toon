  42,2,’A. S. Q
  42,3,"In this fashion Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise makes wahi (sends inspiration) to you and to the people who (went) before you"
  42,4,"To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great"
  42,5,"(As the Hour approaches), the heavens reach the stage that they fall down from their high position; and the angels swiftly act with Praise of their Nourisher-Sustainer and they seek forgiveness for that who is in the earth. Beware! Surely Allah: He is the Oft-Forgiving, the continuously Merciful"
  42,6,And those who have adopted ‘auliya’ besides Him — Allah is Hafeez (Real Protector) over them; and you are not wakil (disposer of affairs) over them
  42,7,"And thus We have inspired unto you Quranan Arabiyyan (‘A Quran in Arabic Language’, ‘An Arabic Reading’) so that you may warn mother of (all) habitations (i.e., the parent-city of mankind), and whoever is (anywhere) around it. And warn of the Day of Assembly — there is no doubt about it: a group (is provided permanent abode) in the Garden (of Bliss), while (another) group (is provided permanent residence to burn) in the blazing Fire (of Hell)"
  42,8,"And if Allah had willed, He could have surely made them one community; but He admits whom He thinks proper in His Mercy. And the transgressors: (there is) not for them out of a wali and nor a helper"
  42,9,"Or have they adopted auliya besides Him? But Allah: He (Alone) is the Wali; and He gives life to the dead; and He is All-Capable over every thing"
  42,10,"And whatsoever you people differed in this (i.e., if you have a dispute regarding any ordainment in this Al-Kitab, then be careful) that its verdict (is traceable) to Allah. This is to you, Allah, (He is) my Nourisher-Sustainer. In Him I have put my trust and to Him (Alone) I turn (for help and forgiveness)"
