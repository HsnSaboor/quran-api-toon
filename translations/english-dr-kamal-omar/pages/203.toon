And He has arranged for them Gardens, flow underneath them rivers — (they will be) dwellers therein, permanently. This is the supreme achievement"
  9,101,"And out of those who are around you out of the rural Arabs are hypocrites, and out of the residents of the city. They strictly persisted in hypocrisy, you know them not, We know them. Soon We shall punish them twice, thereafter they shall be brought back to a horrible punishment"

  9,103,"Accept out of their possessions Sadaqa (donation), you will sanctify them and cleanse them thereby and invoke blessing over them. Surely, your invocking a blessing is a solace for them. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower"

  9,106,"And (there are) others (who) await for Allah’s order. Could be He gives them punishment and could be He turns to them (in Mercy). And Allah is All-Aware, All-Wise"
