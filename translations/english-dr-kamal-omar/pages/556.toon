quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  64,1,Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth glorifies Allah. For Him is the Dominion and Him (Alone) suits the Selective Praise. And He is All-Capable of every thing

  64,9,"The Day He gathers you (all) for the Day of the Gathering: that (will be) the Day when the loss comes to view.

That (will be) the supreme achievement"
