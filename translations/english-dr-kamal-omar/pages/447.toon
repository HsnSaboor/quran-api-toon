quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,25,(O opponents of Al-Kitab)! What (is the matter) with you? You do not provide help to one another
  37,26,"Nay, they, this Day are submitters"
  37,27,And some of them came closer to some others — they question one another
  37,28,"They said: “Certainly (it was) you, you used to come to us from the right side.”"
  37,29,"They (i.e., the others) said: “Nay, you (yourselves) were not Believers"
  37,30,"And there was not in us, regarding you, any authority. Nay! You (yourselves) were a nation of disobedient arrogants"
  37,31,"So the Statement (about punishment) coming from our Nourisher-Sustainer has proved true against us. Verily, we indeed are those who shall taste it very soon"
  37,32,"So we led you astray, since indeed we ourselves used to be astray.”"
  37,33,"So, surely they, this Day, will be co-partners in the torment"
  37,34,"Surely We, in such a manner, We deal with Al-Mujrimun"
  37,35,"Truly they, when it was said to them: “La ilaha-ill-Allah [(there is) no god except Allah]”, they used to show stubborn arrogance"
  37,36,"And they say: “Whether surely we become those who indeed will abandon our aaliha (gods) for the sake of a fanatic poet?”"
  37,37,"Nay! (One who propagates Al-Kitab) has come alongwith Al-Haqq (‘The Truth’), and he has confirmed (and verified) the Messengers"
  37,38,"Verily, you (arrogant disbelievers) are about to become those who taste the painful torment"
  37,39,And you will not be rewarded except what you used to do —
  37,40,save the Ibad of Allah who have been purified and sanctified (from every polytheism and disbelief)
  37,41,"Those people: for them is a well-known provision"
  37,42,"fruits, and they will be honoured people"
  37,43,in the Gardens of delight
  37,44,facing one another on raised couches
  37,45,"round them will pass [boys in perpetual (freshness)] with a cup of a flowing (liquid)"
  37,46,"of white colour, a delight to those who drink (it)"
  37,47,"no bad-effect therein, nor they will suffer intoxication therefrom"
  37,48,"And near them will be those who restrain their glance, (possessing) beautiful wide eyes (with a raven-black cornea on snow-white sclera) —"
  37,49,as if they are eggs well guarded (in a nest)
  37,50,Then some of those (dwellers in Paradise) moved forward towards some (others). They question mutually
  37,51,"One speaker from amongst them said: “Verily I, there was a companion to me (while I stayed in the world)"
