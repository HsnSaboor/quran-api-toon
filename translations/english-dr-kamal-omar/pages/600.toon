quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,and stood fully received whatever (was stored hidden within the hearts) in the chests
  100,11,"Surely, their Nourisher-Sustainer about them, that Day (is) indeed Well-Acquainted (and All-Aware)"
  101,1,Al-Qariah (The great Calamity)
  101,2,What is the great Calamity
  101,3,And what made you realise what is the great Calamity
  101,4,The Day mankind becomes like moths scattered about
  101,5,"And the mountains become like wool, fully carded"
  101,6,"Then as for that: whose weights (of good deeds) became heavy —"
  101,7,so he will be in happy life in complete agreement (of the Will of God)
  101,8,"And as for that: whose weights (of good deeds) became light (and insignificant)"
  101,9,then his parent place will be Hawiyah
  101,10,"And what made you realise what it is, that one"
  101,11,(It is the) Fire extremely hot and fiercely blazing
  102,1,An endeavour to excell others in acquiring (wealth and possessions of this world) has kept you involved —
  102,2,until you visited the sites of burial (of your physical bodies or its remains)
  102,3,By no means (it is of any benefit to you)! Soon you come to know (the consequences)
  102,4,Again (I repeat)! By no means (it is of any benefit to you)! Soon you come to know
  102,5,By no means! Would that you know the Knowledge of certainty
  102,6,"Indeed, you will notice the blazing Fire"
  102,7,Again! You shall indeed see it with an eye of certainty
  102,8,Again! You shall be put to question that Day about the delights (and favour you enjoyed in your worldly life-span)
