quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,74,And bring to mind when He appointed you settling-successors after ’Ad (this is the title of the predecessor-nation) and established you on the land. You raise on its plains palaces and carve out the mountains as homes. So bring to mind the graces of Allah and do not roam about the earth as mischief mongers.”
  7,75,"The leaders of those who behaved in arrogance in his nation said to those who were regarded weak — to such who had Believed amongst them: “Do you regard that Salih is one sent from his Nourisher-Sustainer?” They (in reply) said: “We indeed are Believers in that with which he has been sent.”"
  7,76,"Said those who behaved in arrogance: “Verily, we are disbelievers in that wherein you have Believed.”"
  7,77,"Then they made the she-camel incapacitated (mahead of state her incapable to move in search of food or drink) and they insolently defied the Commandment of their Nourisher-Sustainer and (very defiantly) called out: “O Salih! Approach us with that which you promised us if you are out of those who are sent (as Messengers).”"
  7,78,So the earthquake seized them and they faced the morning in their houses as those who are lying dead (on the ground)
  7,79,"So (Salih) bypassed them and said: “O my nation! I have indeed conveyed to you the Message of my Nourisher-Sustainer and gave you sincere advice but you people do not like those who give sincere advice.”"
  7,80,"And (bring to mind) Lout, when he said to his nation: “Do you indulge in Fahisha? None has preceded you in this throughout the worlds"
  7,81,"Verily, you definitely approach male-adults in sexual lust instead of female-adults. Nay, you are a nation of those transgressing beyond bounds.”"
