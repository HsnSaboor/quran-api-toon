quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  8,53,"This is so because Allah did not become One Who removes a grace which He has bestowed to a nation unless they (i.e., the members of a nation) change what is (good) in their ownselves, — and that Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower"
  8,54,"Like the situation of the followers of Fir’aun and those before them: they belied the Signs of their Nourisher-Sustainer, so We destroyed them for their sins and We drowned the followers of Fir’aun and they all were transgressors"
  8,55,"Verily, the worst of the moving-living creatures in the Sight of Allah are those who have disbelieved, so they shall not Believe"
  8,56,"those with whom you made a covenant, then they break away their covenant each and every time and they do not pay obedience (to Allah)"
  8,57,So if you interlock (yourself) with them in War — then by (routing) them strike terror in those that are behind them per chance they get admonition
  8,58,"And if what you fear from a nation as treachery, throw back to them (their covenant) on equal terms. Surely, Allah does not like the treacherous people"
  8,59,"And must not assess those who have disbelieved that they have gone forward (and won). Surely, they will not frustrate (any of the Divine Plans)"
  8,60,"And accumulate and pile against them whatever you could — out of the power (of soldiers and armaments) and out of a network of mounted cavalry — you shall strike terror through it (in) the enemy of Allah and your enemy, and (also) others besides them; you do not know them, Allah knows them. And whatever you spend of any thing in the Cause of Allah, shall be repaid unto you in full and you are: you shall not be wronged"
  8,61,"And if they inclined to peace, then you incline for it and put (your) trust in Allah. Verily, He: He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower"
