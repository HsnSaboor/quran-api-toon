quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,"And how many out of the generations We destroyed before them — they happened to be stronger than them power-wise. At this stage they ran hither and thither in the cities, (and they were constantly crying): “Is there any place of escape or refuge?”"
  50,37,"Verily, herein is indeed an admonition for one — for him is a heart (that retains counselling and warning), or he made attentive his hearing and he (stood as a) witness"
  50,38,"And surely, indeed We created the heavens and the earth and whatever (exists) between those two in six aeons; and did not overcome Me any of the fatigue"
  50,39,"So remain steadfast against (all) that they say and glorify (Allah) with the praise of your Nourisher-Sustainer before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting. [This refers to the Fajr and Asr Prayers]"
  50,40,"And (out of the hours of) the night also glorify Him. [This refers to Isha Prayer]. And (do glorify Him) after the declines (of the sun). [The decline after the Zenith refers to Zuhr Prayer. The final decline is ‘becoming set’ after remaining visible throughout the day . This refers to Maghrib Prayers]"
  50,41,And listen! The Day the caller will call (as if) from a nearby place
  50,42,the Day they will hear As-Saiha in its true sense. This will be (the) Day for coming out (of the burial places)
  50,43,"Verily We, We, We give life, and We cause death; and to Us is the Final Return"
  50,44,"The Day the earth cracks up exposing them off instantly. This (will be the Day of the Final) Assembly, quite easy for Us (to bring into being)"
  50,45,We know more about what they will say. And you are not unto them as a tyrant (to pressurise them for developing Faith). So propagate the Message through Al-Quran to that who is afraid of My Warning
  51,1,Those that scatter to full scattering act as a witness
  51,2,then those that bear heavy burden
  51,3,then those that float with ease and gentleness
  51,4,then those that distribute (the) matter
  51,5,Definitely what you are promised is surely true
  51,6,And indeed the Judgement is sure to happen
