quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,75,"And if We bestowed mercy on them and removed the distress which is on them, they definitely persisted in their rebellion — they will wander blindly"
  23,76,"And surely, indeed We seized them with punishment, but they humbled not (themselves) to their Nourisher-Sustainer, and they do not submit with humility and reverance"
  23,77,"Until when We opened over them a gate of a severe punishment, then lo! They therein are those who are in despair, devoid of any hope"
  23,78,"And He it is Who has created for you the hearing, and the eyes and the hearts. Very little it is what you pay thanks"
  23,79,And He it is Who has scattered you on the earth and to Him you shall be gathered back
  23,80,And He it is Who gives life and causes death. And to Him (is the source of the) alternation of the night and the day. Will you then not use intellect
  23,81,"Nay, they uttered the like of what said the earlier (misled) people"
  23,82,"They said: “Whether, when we died and we became dust and bones; whether, indeed we will be surely those who have been raised to a new life"
  23,83,"Verily, indeed this we have been promised, we and our fathers, since before. It is not but the written material of the earlier people.”"
  23,84,"Say: “Whose is the earth and whosoever is therein? If you had been knowing!”"
  23,85,"Soon they will say: “For Allah!” Say: “Will you then not remind (your ownself, and others)?”"
  23,86,"Say: “Who is the Nourisher-Sustainer of the seven (many) heavens, and (the) Nourisher-Sustainer of the Great throne?”"
  23,87,"Soon they will say: “For Allah.” Say: “Will you not then pay obedience (to Him Alone)?”"
  23,88,"Say: “Who (it is) — in His hand is the sovereignty (or the dominion) of all things, and He protects (His creations) and one is not given protection against Him — if you know"
  23,89,"Soon they will say: “For Allah.” Say: “Then to what you are being led under the effect of sorcery?”"
