  22,49,"Say: “O you mankind! Certainly, I am to you a warner — evident and manifest"
  22,50,So those who have Believed and performed righteous deeds — for them is Forgiveness and a generous provision

And verily, Allah is the sure Guide to those who have Believed, to the Permanent Path"
  22,55,"And those who have disbelieved will not cease (to be) in doubt about it (i.e., Al-Kitab) until the Hour comes unto them out of a sudden, or there comes unto them the torment of the destructive Day"
