quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  22,6,"That is because Allah: He is the Truth and that it is He who brings dead to life, and that He is All-Capable over all things"
  22,7,"And that the Hour is approaching, there is no doubt about it, and that Allah will Resurrect those who are in graves"
  22,8,"And among mankind is that who disputes about Allah without knowledge, and without guidance, and without an Enlightening Book"
  22,9,"One who folds himself on his lateral side (to show disinterest), that he may lead (people) astray from the Way of Allah: for him, in this world, is disgrace. And We shall make him taste, on the Day of Resurrection, a torment of burning (in Hell-Fire)"
  22,10,This is because of what your two hands have sent forth in advance; and that Allah is not unjust to His Abeed (human-subjects)
  22,11,"And among mankind is that who pays obedience to Allah standing at the border — so if good reached him he became content therewith; and if there reached him a test and trial, he took an about-turn on his face (falling into disbelief). He lost the immediate as well as the Hereafter. This one: it is the evident loss"
  22,12,"He invokes besides Allah that which harms him not and that which benefits him not. This one: it is the straying, far and remote"
  22,13,"He invokes, surely, that whose harm is nearer than his profit; certainly, he (happens to be) an evil maula, and certainly, an evil friend"
  22,14,"Surely, Allah will admit those who have Believed and performed righteous deeds to Gardens — flow, underneath them, rivers. Certainly, Allah does what He wills"
  22,15,"Whoever had been thinking that Allah will never help him in the world and the Hereafter — so he may stretch out through an approach towards the sky, then let him sever it, then let him behold whether his guile does away whereat he rages (in anger)"
