quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,51,"O you people who have Believed! Take not Al-Yahood and An-Nasaaraa as ‘auliya’, some of them are auliya to some (amongst themselves). And whoever befriends them from amongst you, then surely he is from amongst them. Verily, Allah guides not the nation who are the Zalimun"
  5,52,"And you see those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy or disbelief), they are very swift and active amongst those people (and) say: “We fear lest some misfortune befalls us. Then Allah made the possibility — that He comes with victory or an event proceeding from His presence — then they became, over what they concealed in their selves, regretful people"
  5,53,"And those who have Believed will say: “Are these the people who swore their strongest oaths by Allah (that) surely they are with you (Muslims)?” Their deeds became of no effect, so they became losers"
  5,54,"O you who have Believed! Whoever turned back amongst you from his Religion, then very soon Allah will bring (to view) a nation; He will love them and they will love Him, humble towards the Believers, stern towards the disbelievers, striving in the Way of Allah, and they shall not be afraid of the ill-speahead of state of the censurer. This is the Grace of Allah which He bestows upon whom He wills. And Allah is All-Pervasive, All-Knowing"
  5,55,"Definitely it is: Your Wali is Allah, and His Messenger and those who have Believed, the people who establish Salat, and pay up Zakat and they bow down (as an essential part of their canonical Prayer)"
  5,56,"And whosoever takes as Protector - Allah and His Messenger and those who have Believed, then verily, the group of Allah: they are the victorious ones"
  5,57,"O you who have Believed! Pick up not those who have regarded their religion a mockery and fun, from amongst those who were given Al-Kitab before you and the disbelievers — as auliya and pay obedience to Allah if you happen to be Believers"
