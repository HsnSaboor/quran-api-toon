quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,114,"Iesa, son of Maryam said: “Beloved Allah, Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Lower down on us a table set with food (descending) from the heaven. It will become for us Eid (an annual rejoicing) — for the first of us and the last of us — and a sign from You; and provide us sustenance, and You are the best of those who provide sustenance.”"
  5,115,"Allah said: definitely I am One Who lowers it down to you. Then whoever disbelieves afterwards, out of you, then definitely I will inflict him a punishment (such as) I have not inflicted that on anyone out of the worlds"
  5,116,"And when Allah said: o Iesa, son of Maryam! Are you (the one) you said to mankind: “Pick up me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?” He said: “Glory be to You! It does not suit me that I utter what is not to me as permissible. If I happened to be that I said it, then surely You have known it, You know what is in my inner-self and I know not what is in Your’s Self. Truly, You, only You are the All-Knower of what is hidden and unseen"
  5,117,"I did not say to them except what you commanded me concerning it — that: ‘Pay obedience to Allah, my Nourisher-Sustainer and your Nourisher-Sustainer’; and I remained over them as witness while I dwelt amongst them, but when you gave me Wafat, You were, Only You, the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness over all things"
  5,118,"If You punish them so surely they are Your Ibad and if You forgive for them, then verily You, only You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise"
  5,119,"Allah said: ‘This is a Day the truthful will profit from their truth. For them are Gardens, flow under them rivers, dwellers therein forever. Allah got pleased with them and they got pleased with Him. This is the great success.’"
  5,120,For Allah is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them and He is All-Capable over all things
