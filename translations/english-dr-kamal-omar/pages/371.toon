quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,And grant me a truthful tongue (an honest reporting) among later generations
  26,85,And make me among the inheritors of the Garden of Delight
  26,86,"And grant forgiveness for my father, surely he is of the erring ones"
  26,87,And disgrace me not when (all) are resurrected —
  26,88,"the Day when does not benefit the wealth, and nor sons"
  26,89,except that who came to Allah with a heart in complete submission
  26,90,And the Paradise has been brought closest to the righteous
  26,91,And the Hell-Fire is brought to full view of the erring people
  26,92,"And it is said to them: “Where (have gone) those whom you used to worship —"
  26,93,besides Allah? Do they provide you help or provide assistance to themselves in retaliation (to Allah’s decision)?”
  26,94,Then they were thrown on their faces into this (Fire) — they (who encouraged their own worship) and (all) the erring ones
  26,95,and the groups of Iblis — altogether
  26,96,They said while they therein indulge in arguments
  26,97,By Allah! When we had been surely in manifest error
  26,98,when we hold you as equal with the Nourisher-Sustainer of the worlds
  26,99,and did not deviate us except Al-Mujrimun
  26,100,So there are not for us out of the intercessors
  26,101,nor a devoted friend
  26,102,"Then if there could be for us one chance of return to the worldly life, then we will (definitely) become out of those who Believe.”"
  26,103,"Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not Believers"
  26,104,"And verily, your Nourisher-Sustainer: truly, He is the All-Mighty, the continuously Merciful"
  26,105,The nation of Nuh belied the Messengers
  26,106,"when their brother Nuh said to them: “Will you not pay obedience (to Allah)"
  26,107,"Certainly, I am to you a trustworthy Messenger"
  26,108,So pay obedience to Allah and obey me
  26,109,And I do not ask you for this any reward. My reward is not due except with the Nourisher-Sustainer to the worlds
  26,110,So pay obedience to Allah and obey me
  26,111,"They said: “Shall we Believe for your sake while (only) those who belong to the lower-strata of society have followed you?”"
