  28,44,"And you were not on the western side (of the valley, along the mountain) when We completed to Musa the command (directing him to proceed to Firaun); and you are not among the witnesses"
  28,45,"But We brought forth generations, then the life became prolonged for them. And you became not a dweller among the residents of Madyan (that) you (may) reproduce unto them Ayaatina, but We, We remained those who send Messengers"
  28,46,"And you were not by the side of the mountain when We did call (Musa to appoint him as a Prophet).

  28,48,"But when Al-Haqq has come to them from Us, they said: “Why he has not been delivered the like of what was delivered to Musa?” Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Musa before?

  28,49,"Say: “Then come over with a Book from Allah, which is a better guide than these two [i.e., Musa and the Divine Book (so that)] I may follow it, if you are truthful.”"
  28,50,"But if they responded you not, then know that what (is a fact is that) they follow their vain desires. And who is more astray than that who followed his (own) desire without guidance from Allah? Verily, Allah does not guide the nation of the transgressors"
