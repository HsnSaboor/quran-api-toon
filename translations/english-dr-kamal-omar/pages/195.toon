  9,49,"And amongst them is that who says: “Grant me permission (to stay away from Qital) and do not put me to test.” Have they not (already) fallen into trial (and have failed in the test)? And Verily, Hell is surely all-surveillant for the disbelievers"
  9,50,"If reached you (some) good it hurts them, and if befell you a difficulty, they say: “We took our precaution beforehand,” and they turned away, and they (are) those who rejoice"
