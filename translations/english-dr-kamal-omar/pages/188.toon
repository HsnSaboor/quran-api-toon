quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,7,"How would there be, regarding Mushrikun, a covenant with Allah and with His Messenger, except (for) those who made a treaty with you near Al-Masjid-al-Haram? So, as long as they took a stand in your favour, so you take a stand in their favour. Surely, Allah loves Al-Muttaqun"
  9,8,"How (one can be sincere to the treaty when they show treachery?) and if they overpowered you they pay no regard to you for ties of kinship and nor (for) covenant. They (try to) make you happy (by uttering hollow words) with their mouths, although their hearts disagree and most of them are Fasiqun"
  9,9,"They have purchased with the Ayaat of Allah a meagre sum, so they obstructed (people) from His Path. Certainly they: evil (it is) what they used to do"
  9,10,"They pay no regard to the Believer for ties of kinship and nor (for) covenant. And they: they are the transgressors"
  9,11,"And if they repented (and entered the fold of Islam) and established As-Salat and paid up Az-Zakat, then they are your brethren in Religion. And We give details to the Ayaat for a nation who know"
  9,12,"And if they violated their oaths after their covenant and brought bad remarks regarding your Religion then perform Qital with the Imams of Kufr — surely they: (their) oaths (have) no (meaning) to them — so that they may cease (their evil actions)"
  9,13,"Will you not indulge in Qital with a nation who have violated and nullified their oaths and made an intention to expel the Messenger, and they: they have provided you a start for the first time? Would you fear them? Then Allah has more right that you should fear Him provided you are Believers"
