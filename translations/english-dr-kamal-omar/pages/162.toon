quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,88,"The leaders who behaved in arrogance amongst his nation said: “We shall certainly drive you out, O Shu’aib, and those who have Believed in association to you, from our town, or else you (all) shall return back in our grouping.” (Shu’aib) said: “Even though we had been those who feel repulsion"
  7,89,"Definitely, We invented a lie against Allah if we (ever) entered back in your grouping after when Allah has rescued us from that. And it does not suit us that we return to it except that Allah, our Nourisher-Sustainer desires (some other outlet). Our Nourisher-Sustainer became Fully Comprehensive in knowledge for all things. In Allah we have put our trust. Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Judge between us and between our nation in justice. And You are the Best of the judges.”"
  7,90,"And the chiefs of those who disbelieved among his nation said: “If you followed Shu’aib, be sure, you then become the losers.”"
  7,91,"So the earthquake seized them, so they faced the morning in their houses as those who are lying dead (on the ground)"
  7,92,"Those who belied Shu’aib, (appeared) as if they never lived therein. Those who belied Shu’aib, became — they very ones as the losers"
  7,93,"Then he (Shu’aib) bypassed them and said: “O my nation! Certainly I conveyed to you the Messages of my Nourisher-Sustainer and gave you sincere advice. Then how I feel sorry for the nation of disbelievers.”"
  7,94,And We sent not unto any town from (the category of) a Prophet — except (when) We had involved its people in sufferings and calamities (due to their open indifference to the teachings in Al-Kitab) — so that they may show humility (to the Divine Message)
  7,95,"Then (when inspite of this they did not reform themselves) We set luxury in place of difficulty until every thing went forth much beyond their needs and they said: “Surely the suffering and luxury touched our fathers too (so there remains no need to take a turn to the Book of Allah).” Then We seized them without any additional warning in a manner they will perceive not.”"
