quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  10,79,"And Firaun said (to his administrators): “Produce before me every expert magician.”"
  10,80,"And when the magicians came, Musa said to them: “Place on the ground whatever you want to put down.”"
  10,81,"Then when they dropped (their items) on the ground, Musa said: “What you came alongwith is sorcery. Surely, Allah, very soon, will prove it false. Verily, Allah does not reform the work of Al-Mufsidun"
  10,82,And Allah will establish Al-Haqq as true with the help of His statements (therein) even if the Mujrimun felt aversion
  10,83,"But did not Believe in Musa (anyone) except the younger generation of his nation because of the fear of Firaun and their chiefs, lest they should put them to persecution and torture; and verily, Firaun behaved as an arrogant tyrant on the earth, and indeed he was surely of the Musrifun (those who breahead of state the limits, indulge in transgression)"
  10,84,"And Musa said: “O my nation! If you have developed Faith in Allah then put your trust in Him if you are (really) Muslims.”"
  10,85,"So they said: “In Allah we have put our trust. Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Make us not a trial for the nation of the transgressors"
  10,86,And save us by Your Mercy from the nation of disbelievers.”
  10,87,"And We sent inspiration to Musa and his brother that: 'Both of you specify for the nation of you two the houses in Egypt. And regard your (such) houses as Qiblah and establish salat and give glad tidings to the Believers.’"
  10,88,"And Musa said: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Surely, You have bestowed Firaun and his chiefs splendour and wealth in the life of this world, our Nourisher-Sustainer, so that they may lead (men) astray from your Path? Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Destroy their possessions and harden their hearts, so that they may not Believe until they see the painful torment.”"
