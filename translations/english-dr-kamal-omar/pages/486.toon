  42,23,"This is (the Paradise) whereof Allah gives glad tidings to His Ibad who have Believed and have performed righteous deeds. Say: “I do not ask you (any) reward over this (propagation work) except Al-Mawaddatah (The loving desire) for Al-Qurbah [nearness or closeness (to Allah)]”.

  42,30,"And whatever adversity or affliction befell you, so it is because of what your hands have already earned; and He pardons and overlooks numerous (of your errors and deviations)"
  42,31,"And you are not those who will frustrate (Allah regarding His punishment) in the earth. And there is not for you besides Allah, out of a wali, and nor a helper"
