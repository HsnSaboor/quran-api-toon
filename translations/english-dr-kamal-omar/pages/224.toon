quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,20,"Those people: they shall not be those who can frustrate (Allah) on the earth. And there is not for them besides Allah any one out of the protectors. The punishment shall be enhanced for them. They had not been capable of hearing and they had not been such that they may be seeing (the reality)"
  11,21,They are those who damaged their selves; and vanished from them whatever they used to invent in falsehood
  11,22,"No doubt! That they, in the Hereafter: they are the greatest losers"
  11,23,"Certainly, those who have Believed and did righteous deeds and humbled (themselves) before their Nourisher-Sustainer — they are the companions of the Garden, they are dwellers therein"
  11,24,The like of (such) two groups (is) as the more blind and more deaf; and one who (is) deep in sight and deep in hearing. Are the two equal when compared? Will you then not take heed
  11,25,"And indeed, We sent Nuh to his nation (and he addressed them thus): “Certainly, I am unto you a plain warner"
  11,26,"that you do not pay obedience except to Allah; surely, I fear for you the torment of a painful Day.”"
  11,27,"So said the representatives of those who had disbelieved in his nation: “We don’t mark (any thing in) you except (being) a man like us; and we don’t mark (any one) follow you except those: they are the meanest amongst us having only superficial opinions, not based on thinhead of state. And we do not see in you any merit above us; in fact we regard you as liars.”"
  11,28,"(Nuh) said: “O my nation! Have you pondered, if I am on Bayyinah from my Nourisher-Sustainer and He has bestowed on me Mercy from Him but it stood obscured from you people — shall we impose it over you people while you are, unto it, as those who develop hatred against some thing"
