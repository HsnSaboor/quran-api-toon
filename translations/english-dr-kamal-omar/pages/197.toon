quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,62,"They swear by Allah regarding you (Muslims) so that they may please you. Although ‘Allah and His Messenger’ have more right that they should please that (twain together), if they happened to be Believers"
  9,63,"Didn’t they know that it (is so, that) whoever shows hostility to Allah and His Messenger, so surely, for him is the Fire of Hell, (he becomes) a dweller therein? This is an extreme disgrace"
  9,64,"The hypocrites feel afraid (and apprehend) that a Surah regarding them would be sent which would make evident over them about what is in their hearts. Say: “You continue to ridicule! Certainly, Allah is the One Who brings out in the open what you apprehend"
  9,65,"If you ask them (about this), they will surely say: “Surely, it is that we talk idly and we play.” Say: “Whether, with Allah, and His Ayaat and His Messenger, you had been ridiculing?”"
  9,66,"Make no excuse; indeed, you have disbelieved after (getting) your Faith. If We overlook (and do not punish) a group amongst you, We will punish the (other) group because they were criminals"
  9,67,"The male hypocrites and the female hypocrites — some of them (are) from some (others). They enjoin what is forbidden and they forbid what is desirable (and ordained); and they keep closed their hands (and make no donations in Allah’s Cause). They have forgotten Allah, so He forgot them. Verily, the Munafiqun: they are the Fasiqun"
  9,68,"Allah has promised the male hypocrites and the female hypocrites and the disbelievers, the Fire of Hell. (They shall be) dwellers therein. It sufficed them and Allah has cursed them and for them is the lasting torment"
