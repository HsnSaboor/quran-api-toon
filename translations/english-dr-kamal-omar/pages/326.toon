quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  21,45,"Say: “Surely what (is a fact is that) I give you warning through al-Wahi (The Revelation).“ And the deaf hears not the call when, whatever, they are warned"

  21,47,"And We shall set up Balances of justice (to weigh and measure the personalities) on the Day of Resurrection. Then no injustice would be done to any person in any form. And if there be the weight of a seed of mustard, We came forward with it (to count it as a weight in measure). And sufficient became We as Reckoners"
  21,48,"And surely, indeed, We delivered Musa and Harun Al-Furqan and Zia and Zikr for Al-Muttaqun —"

  21,56,"(Ibrahim) said: “Nay! Nourisher-Sustainer to you people is the Nourisher-Sustainer of the heavens and the earth — That One Who initiated them, and I am, over your this matter, out of those who are direct witnesses"
  21,57,"And (I make) Allah as Witness. Surely, I shall plot a plan (for) your idols after when you have returned showing (your) backs (to me).\" [This was a vague indication that the incident shall occur in the temple when a congregation is dispersed and people are returning with their backs towards the temple]"
