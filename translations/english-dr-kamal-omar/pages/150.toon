quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,158,"Do they await? (They await nothing) except that may come to them angels or comes your Nourisher-Sustainer, or there come some of the signs of your Nourisher-Sustainer. The Day there come some of the Signs of your Nourisher-Sustainer — shall not provide benefit to a Nafs her Faith if she does not become (one who) developed Faith before (this phenomenon), or she earned through her Faith (some) good (to her credit). Say: “Wait you! We are also (among) those who wait.”"
  6,159,"Verily, those who divided their religion and have become sects (religious groupings and cults) — you are not from among them in any way — certainly it is that their case goes to Allah, then He will inform them about what they had been indulging in"
  6,160,"Whoever came with a good deed, so, for him, shall be credited ten similar ones to it; and whoever came with an evil deed, so he shall not be rewarded except one similar to it; and they will not be judged unjustly"
  6,161,"Say: “Surely, My Nourisher-Sustainer has guided me to Sirat-e-Mustaqim, Deenan Qiyaman, Millat (Qiblah, Week-Day and City for Tawaf, Umrah and Hajj) of Ibrahim, the unitarian. And he was not of Al-Mushrikun"

  6,163,(There is) no partner to Him. And about this I have been commanded and I am the first of the Muslims (as I am being inspired of Al-Kitab in my era)
  6,164,"Say: “Shall I seek a nourisher-sustainer other than Allah while He is Nourisher-Sustainer to all things? And no Nafs earns (as evil any thing) except against her self. And does not carry the burden, any bearer of burdens, the burden of another. Then unto your Nourisher-Sustainer is your return, so He will inform you about that wherein you have been differing"
  6,165,"And He it is Who appointed you settling-successors on earth and He raised some of you over some others in ranks, so that He may test you in what He provided you. Surely your Nourisher-Sustainer is Swift in retribution, and certainly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
