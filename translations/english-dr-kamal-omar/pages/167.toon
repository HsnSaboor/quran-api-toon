quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,138,"And We made Bani Israiel to cross over the sea, so they intermingled with a nation who are staying over the idols (they had carved) for themselves. They said: “O Musa! Appoint to us an ilah (a god) as to them are (their) aaliha (gods)!” (Musa) said: “Verily, you are a nation who indulge in ignorance"
  7,139,"Surely these people: stands destroyed, which they are involved in, and (it is all) false what they had been doing.”"
  7,140,"(Musa further) said: “Shall I seek for you an ilah other than Allah while He made you superior over the worlds (as Muslims)?”"
  7,141,"And (bring to mind) when We rescued you from the followers of Fir’aun; they (used to) give you torture in punishment — they are killing your sons and letting your women survive, and in this (is) an extreme test from your Nourisher-Sustainer"
  7,142,"And We promised Musa ‘thirty nights’ and We completed this term with ten (additional sessions). So he (i.e., Musa) completed the sitting (arranged by) his Nourisher-Sustainer (appearing as) forty nights. And Musa said to his brother Harun: “Act as my vicegerent to my nation and do reform and do not follow the way of the mischief-seekers.”"
  7,143,"And when Musa came to the site of sitting appointed by Us and his Nourisher-Sustainer talked to him, he said: “My Rabb! Be apparent to me, I will look upon you.” Allah said: “Never shall you see Me (as your abilities as a human creation stand limited) but (continue to) look towards the mountain, then if it stood stationary and entire at its place, then soon you shall see Me.” So when his Nourisher-Sustainer manifested in Light for the mount, He made it collapsed to dust, and Musa fell down unconscious. Then when he revived (in his senses and became fully conscious) he said: “Glory to You, I have turned to You in repentance and I am the First of the Believers.”"
