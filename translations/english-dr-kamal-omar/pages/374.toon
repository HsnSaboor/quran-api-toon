quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,The nation of Lout belied the Messengers —
  26,161,"when their brother Lout said to them: “Will you not pay obedience (to Allah)"
  26,162,"Verily, I am unto you a trustworthy Messenger"
  26,163,So pay obedience (to Allah) and obey me
  26,164,And I do not ask you for this any reward. My reward is not due except with the Nourisher-Sustainer to the worlds
  26,165,Do you approach males (to satisfy your appetite) out of (the people in) the worlds
  26,166,"and you avoid what your Nourisher-Sustainer has created for you, out of your (female) consorts? Nay, you are a nation who trespass and transgress"
  26,167,"They said: “If you do not desist (from your sermons and counsellings) O Lout, surely you become of those who have been expelled (and banished from the land)"
  26,168,"(Lout) said: “Without a speck of doubt I am of those who have a feeling of hate and detestation against your act (of homosexuality)"
  26,169,My Nourisher-Sustainer! Save me and my family members and followers from what the people do
  26,170,"So We saved him and his family, all (of them) —"
  26,171,"except an old woman, (We left her) in those who were to be covered under the dust and debris (of the torment)"
  26,172,Afterwards We completely destroyed the others
  26,173,And We rained on them a rain (of torment). Then evil became the rain to those who were warned (in advance)
  26,174,"Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not Believers"
  26,175,"And verily, your Nourisher-Sustainer: truly He is the All-Mighty, the continuously Merciful"
  26,176,The dwellers of Al-’Aiyka belied the Messengers
  26,177,"when Shuaib said to them: “Will you not pay obedience (to Allah)"
  26,178,"Surely, I am, unto you, a trustworthy Messenger"
  26,179,So pay obedience to Allah and obey me
  26,180,"And I do not ask you for this, any reward. My reward is not due except with the Nourisher-Sustainer to the worlds"
  26,181,Complete the measure or weight and be not of those who give less
  26,182,And weigh with a balance which (deceives not and) maintains its balance
  26,183,"And defraud not people in their items (regarding number, quality, measure or weight etc.) and behave not in the land as disruptionists or as corrupt people"
