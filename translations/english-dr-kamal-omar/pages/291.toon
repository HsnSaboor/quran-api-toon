  17,88,"Declare: “If mankind and jinn joined together that they may bring (something) similar to this Al-Quran, they shall not (and never) bring similar to that even if some of them are to some (others) as those who provide utmost assistance and help.”"

  17,90,"And they said: “We shall never Believe for your sake until you cause to gush forth for us out of the earth, a spring"
  17,91,"Or there may be for you a garden of date-palms and grapes, and you cause to gush forth rivers in their midst abundantly"
