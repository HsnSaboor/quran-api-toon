quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,40,"And the Day He gathers them all together, (and) afterwards says to the angels: “Whether all these had been worshipping exclusively you?”"
  34,41,"They (angels) said: “Glory be to You! You (Alone) are our Wali instead of them. Nay, they used to worship the jinns; most of them had been believers in them.”"
  34,42,"So this Day, some of you do not possess any benefit for some (others amongst you), and nor (any) harm. And We shall say to those who transgressed: ' Taste the torment of the Fire which you used to belie"
  34,43,"And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, they said: “What is he, except a male-adult who intends that he may deviate you people from that what your fathers (i.e., ancestors) used to worship.” And they (also) said: “(It is) not but a lie which has been forged.” And those who disbelieved said regarding Al-Haqq (The Truth) when it reached them: “(It is) not but evident magic!” [Being convinced of its magical effects in demolishing their ancient beliefs and concepts, they brought such comments]"
  34,44,"And We did not give them out of Books which they must take lessons thereof, (rather We sanctioned and specified for them Only One Book). And We did not send unto them out of a warner, before you"
  34,45,"And those before them (also) belied, and they have not reached (even to) one tenth (1/10th) of what We had granted to those (who went as previous generations), yet they belied My Messengers. Then how (terrible) became My denial (in bringing a humiliating punishment for the deniers)"
  34,46,"Say: “Verily what (is a fact is that) I admonish you through Wahidatin [‘One single Entity’. This is also an attribute for Allah’s Permanent Scripture]: that you standup for Allah in pairs and singly, (and) then ponder — there is no fanaticism in your companion. He is not but a warner unto you between the two hands (i.e., in face of) a severe torment.”"
  34,47,"Say: “Whatever reward I might have asked of you, so it is for you. My reward is not (due) except on Allah, and He is Witness over all things.”"
  34,48,"Say: “Certainly, my Nourisher-Sustainer strikes (on the target) with Al-Haqq (‘The Truth’), the All-Knower of the ghuyub (the unseens).”"
