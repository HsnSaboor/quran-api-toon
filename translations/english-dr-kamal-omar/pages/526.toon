quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,The star when it lost its brightness acts as a witness
  53,2,"(that) your companion has not strayed, and he has made no error"
  53,3,And he does not speak of (his own) desire
  53,4,It is not but Inspiration that has been provided as inspiration
  53,5,"Mighty in power [the arch-angel Jibriel (Gabriel)] has transmitted him Knowledge"
  53,6,Capable of most swift movement; then he became stationary and stable —
  53,7,while he (was) in the higher part of the horizon
  53,8,"afterwards he came closer, then became face to face"
  53,9,"So he was at a distance of two bow-lengths, or (so to say, even) nearer"
  53,10,Then did (Allah) convey the Inspiration to His Abd whatever He did convey as Inspiration
  53,11,The heart (of the recipient) did not deny whatever he viewed
  53,12,Will you then dispute with him about what he has witnessed
  53,13,"And surely, indeed he (i.e., the recipient of Inspiration) did see him (i.e., the arch-angel Jibriel in his natural angelic state during) another descent"
  53,14,close to Sidrat-ul-muntaha (lote-tree that demarcates the limits or the borders)
  53,15,Close to that (lote-tree) lies (the original site of) the orchard of abode
  53,16,When covered the lote-tree whatever did cover it
  53,17,"The sight (of the recipient of Inspiration) did not move hither and thither, and it did not transgress the limits"
  53,18,"Surely, indeed he witnessed some of the great Signs of his Nourisher-Sustainer. [Please note that two different incidents are recorded in these initial verses of the Surah. One thing which is common to both the incidents is the descent of angel-Jibriel. The ascent of the person who is receiving the Inspiration is mentioned nowhere. It appears that some life-generating Rays or Light was showered by Allah on a garden that appeared extinct. The Life-giving source revived the garden in original state to make the recipient of Inspiration witness some of the Great Signs out of the Miraculous Signs of Allah]"
  53,19,"Have you then ever seen (with your own eyes) Al-Lat, and Al-’Uzza"
  53,20,"and Manat the third, the later one? [These are some of the proper-names of some imaginary deities of the people]"
  53,21,What! For you a son and for Him a daughter
  53,22,This then (becomes) a distribution most awkward and unjust
  53,23,"These are not but names which you have allotted them as names — you and your forefathers. Allah has sent down no proof thereof. They follow not but conjecture and (follow) that which the Anfus (selves) desire. And surely, indeed, has come to them, from their Nourisher-Sustainer, Al-Hudah"
  53,24,Is (it) available to a human being whatever he desired
  53,25,But for Allah (is) the Hereafter and the initial (world)
  53,26,And how many (are) from among the angels in the heavens— their intercession (in favour of a human being) does not benefit (one) in any form except after that Allah permits for whom He thinks proper and He agrees (therewith)
