quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  27,56,"So there was no answer from his nation except that they said: “Drive out the family of Lout from your town. Verily, they are humans who remain clean and sanctified.”"
  27,57,So We saved him and his household except his wife. We destined her to be of those who buried themselves under dust and debris
  27,58,And We rained down over them a rain (of stones). So evil became the rain cast over those who were warned (in advance)
  27,59,"Say: “Selective Praise suits Allah (Alone), and peace be upon His Ibad whom He selected and chose (for His Message). Is Allah better, or (all) that they ascribe as partners (to Allah)?”"
  27,60,"Is That One Who created the heavens and the earth and sent down for you water from towards the sky (better or other gods)? So We brought forth therewith orchards full of beauty and delight. It is not for you that you may grow the trees thereof. Is there any ilah (god) alongwith Allah? Nay, they are a nation who ascribe equals (to Him)"
  27,61,"Is That One Who has made the earth as a place of stay and has placed in its midst, rivers and has placed in its interest mountains (which give it stability of motion), and has set between two seas a barrier (which keeps the sweet and salt water as separate collections) — is there any ilah alongwith Allah? Nay, most of them know not"
  27,62,"Is That One Who responds to the distressed one when he called Him, and removes the evil and makes you settling-successors on the earth — is there any ilah alongwith Allah? Little is that which you remind (yourself or remind the others)"
  27,63,"Is the One Who guides you in the darknesses of the land and the sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings between the two hands (i.e., just prior to) His Mercy (i.e., the rains) — is there any ilah alongwith Allah? Allah became Exalted above all that they associate as partners (to Him)"
