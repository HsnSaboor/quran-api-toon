quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,61,"So when the two groups see (each other) the companions of Musa said: “Surely, we are indeed those who have been traced (by the persecuting enemy)"
  26,62,"(Musa) said: “Certainly never! Certainly, with me is my Nourisher-Sustainer, soon He guides me.”"
  26,63,"So We sent inspiration to Musa (saying) that: \"Strike with your rod (on) the sea.” Instantly it parted and each separate part (of the sea-water) became like a firm mass, extremely huge"
  26,64,And We made the others come at that very site
  26,65,And We saved Musa and whoever was with him — all together
  26,66,Then (then and there) We drowned the others
  26,67,"Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not Believers"
  26,68,"And verily, your Nourisher-Sustainer: truly He is the All-Mighty, the continuously Merciful"
  26,69,And rehearse unto them the information about Ibrahim
  26,70,"When he said to his father and his nation: “What is it that you worship?”"
  26,71,"They said: “We worship idols and we remain confined in retreat (to them)"

  26,73,Or they give you benefit or they give (you) harm?”
  26,74,"They said: “Nay, we found our fathers- like this they do.”"
  26,75,"He said: “Have you then (ever) observed that which you have been worshipping —"
  26,76,you and your ancient fathers
  26,77,"So, surely, they are enemies to me, except the Nourisher-Sustainer to the worlds"
  26,78,"That Who has created me, then He (also) guides me"
  26,79,"And That Who: He feeds me and gives me to drink (palatable water and other liquids)"
  26,80,"And when I fell sick, then He cures me"
  26,81,"And That Who will cause me to die, (and) afterwards shall revive me"
  26,82,"And That, Who: I exceedingly desire that He forgives me my faults on the Day of Accountability.”"
  26,83,My Nourisher-Sustainer! Bestow on me decisive power and join me with the righteous
