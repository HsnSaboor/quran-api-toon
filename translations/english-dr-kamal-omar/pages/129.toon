quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  6,9,"And had We made him (that is, the one who is to be appointed a Messenger to mankind) an angel, indeed We would have made him (appear as) a man, and certainly, We would have caused them confusion in the matter which they have covered with confusion (because an angel when he appears to an ordinary person he appears, as a man and not in his real angelic form)"
  6,10,"And indeed mockery was committed with the Messengers before you, so covered those, who scoffed amongst them, the very thing with which they had been indulging in ridicule"
  6,11,"Say: “Travel on the earth (and) afterwards ponder what was the ultimate end of those who rejected (the statements in Al-Kitab)"
  6,12,"Say: “For whom is what is in the heavens and the earth?” Say: “For Allah. He has (Himself) ordained upon His self (to shower) Mercy (on His Ibad). Indeed He will gather you together towards the Day of Resurrection. (There is) no doubt in this”. Those who have damaged their selves, so they shall not Believe"
  6,13,"And for Him is what stayed during the night and the day, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing"
  6,14,"Say: “Shall I take as a wali other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth? And He feeds (all His creation) but (Himself) is not fed.” Say: “Verily, I am commanded that I become the first one who accepted Islam (as revealed in its original, in my era).” And be not from amongst the polytheists"
  6,15,"Say: “Surely, I fear, if I disobeyed my Nourisher-Sustainer, the punishment of a Mighty Day.”"
  6,16,"Who is averted from it that Day, then surely He has showered Mercy on him. And that is the obvious success"
  6,17,"And if Allah makes some trouble get attached to you, then there is none for it who can relieve, except He. And if He makes some good get attached to you, then He is All-Capable over all things"
  6,18,"And He is the Irresistible, above His Ibad. And He is the All-Wise, Well-Acquainted (with all things)"
