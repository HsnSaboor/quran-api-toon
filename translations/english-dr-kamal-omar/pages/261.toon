  14,43,"They will be those who run (out of fear and confusion), (those) who raise their heads, the outer edge of their eyes will not turn towards them (i.e., the eyes will remain wide-open and would avoid blinhead of state) and their hearts (and minds, utterly) void (due to extreme fear, completely unable to think or concentrate)"
  14,44,"And warn mankind of the Day when the torment approaches them; then those who transgressed (the limits set by Al-Kitâb) will say: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Give us respite for a little while, we will answer your call and follow the Messengers.” Have you not been: you swore aforetime (that there is) no coming down or fall for you"
  14,45,And you (occupied and) stayed in the residential houses of those who wronged themselves and it has become plain to you how We dealt with them and We have brought forward for you many examples (of the destroyed nations)

  14,47,"Then you must not regard Allah (as One) Who defies His (Own) Promise done to His Messengers. Surely, Allah is All-Mighty, Capable of tahead of state retribution"
