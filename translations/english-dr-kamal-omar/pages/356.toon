quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,44,"Allah interchanges the night and the day. Truly, in these is indeed a lesson for the possessors of the sights"
  24,45,"And Allah created every living and moving creature from water. So out of them is that who creeps on its belly; and of them is that who walks on two legs; and of them is that who moves on four (limbs). Allah creates what He thinks proper. Verily, Allah is All-Capable over all things"
  24,46,"Surely, indeed We have sent down Ayaat [Signs (of Divine Wisdom)], Mubayyinat (that make things plain, manifest and clear). And Allah guides whom He thinks proper to the Permanent Path"
  24,47,"And people say: “We have Believed in Allah and in the Messenger and we have obeyed.” Then a group of them turns away thereafter. And they are not with the Believers"
  24,48,"And when they were called towards Allah and His Messenger so that He may pronounce judgment about them, lo! A group amongst them behave as deviators"
  24,49,"And if the just decision remains for them (i.e., it is favourable to them) they come to him as those who are willing and are in submission"
  24,50,"Is there a disease in their hearts? Or they have developed doubt? Or they fear that Allah and His Messenger will show prejudice against them? Nay, those people: (it is) they themselves who are the transgressors"
  24,51,"Surely, what (is expected and) became a response of the Believers — when they are called towards Allah and His Messenger so that he may decide amongst them (is) — that they may say: “We heard, and we obeyed.” And those people: they (very ones are) those who attain success"
  24,52,"And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger and remains mindful of Allah and submits to Him (Alone), then those people: they (are the ones who) stand elevated"
  24,53,"They swore by Allah their strongest oaths that if you ordered them they will surely come out (of their houses to strive in Allah‘s Cause). Say: “Swear you not. What is required is desirable obedience. Verily, Allah is Well-Aware of what you do.”"
