quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  35,4,"And if they belie you, so indeed the Messengers were belied before you. And to Allah are made to return (all) matters (for final decision)"
  35,5,"O you mankind! Verily, the Promise made by Allah is true. So let not this present life deceive you and let not the chief deceiver (i.e., Iblis) deceive you regarding Allah"
  35,6,"Surely, Satan is an enemy to you, so treat him as an enemy. Truly, what (is a fact is that) he invites his group that they may become out of the dwellers of the blazing Fire"
  35,7,"Those who have disbelieved: for them (awaits) a severe torment; and those who have Believed and performed righteous deeds, for them (awaits) forgiveness and a great reward"
  35,8,"Is he then, to whom the evil of his deeds is made fair-seeming, and he regarded it as good (at par to one who is rightly guided)? So definitely, Allah allows to go astray whom He thinks proper, and guides whom He thinks proper. So your ‘self’ may not cripple herself (remaining) in sorrows (and regrets) over them. Certainly, Allah is All-Knower of what they do and invent"
  35,9,"And it is Allah Who directed the winds, so they lift up the clouds, then We drove that (cloud) to a dead land, then We revived therewith the land after its death. Like this (there will be) the Resurrection"
  35,10,"Whosoever had been desiring honour, then to Allah (Alone) belongs all honour. To Him ascends the Al-Kalimun Tayyib (The Palatable and Desirable Statement) and the righteous deeds lift it up (to an acceptable status). And those people who plot evils — for them is a severe torment. And the plotting of those people — it shall perish"
  35,11,"And Allah did create you (Adam) from dust, then (the offspring) from Nutfah then He made you pairs (male and female). And no female conceives, and nor she delivers, but with His Knowledge. And no aged man is granted a span of life, and nor a deduction is made from his life, but it is in record. [Any human being granted an extra-ordinary long life or an extra-ordinary short life will find the matter written in advance in the Record of events available with Allah]. Surely, this is quite easy for Allah (to do)"
