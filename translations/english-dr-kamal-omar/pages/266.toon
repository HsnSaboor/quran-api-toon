  15,72,"Your life acts as a witness. Surely, they indeed, behaved as blind (to moral standards) in their wild intoxication"
  15,73,So As-Saiha seized them while they were about to be those who witnessed the sunrise
  15,74,Then We turned the elevated things of that (habitation) to submerged things of that (habitation); and We rained over those people stones from the fully recorded (store house of such stones which are piled up over there and specifically marked for such purposes)
