  23,105,"Were not My Verses reproduced unto you, but you used to deny them"
  23,106,"They said: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Our wretchedness overcame us and we became an erring nation"
  23,107,"Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Bring us out of this, then if we repeated (evil way of life) then indeed we (will be) transgressors.”"
  23,108,"(Allah) said: “Stay in ignominy therein and do not talk to Me"
  23,109,"Certainly, it (was that there) was a group out of My Ibad who used to say: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer! We have Believed, so bestow forgiveness for us, and have mercy on us, for You are the Best of those who show mercy.”"
  23,110,But you took them for a laughing stock (and you continued long sessions of such jest and mockery) until they made you forget My Remembrance while you used to laugh at them
  23,111,"Verily! I have rewarded them (whom you used to mock and laugh at) this Day for they remained patient. Indeed, they — they are the successful ones"
  23,112,"(Allah) said: “What number of years did you stay on earth?”"
  23,113,"They said: “We stayed a day or part of a day. Ask those who keep account.”"
  23,114,"(Allah) said: “You stayed not but very little — if that you, you had been knowing"
  23,115,"Whether, then, you assessed that what (is the fact is that) We created you without any purpose and that you will not be returned to Us"

  23,117,"And whoever invokes alongwith Allah another ilah — there is no proof for him for this (blasphemy) — then definitely what (is a fact is that) his accountability is with his Nourisher-Sustainer. Surely, it (is that) al-Kafirun do not attain success"
  23,118,"And say: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Forgive and have mercy, for You are the Best of those who bestow mercy.”"
