quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"Those who disbelieved and hindered (others) from the Way of Allah, He allowed their deeds to follow a wrong track"
  47,2,"And those who Believed and did righteous deeds and Believed in accordance with what has been delivered to Muhammad, for it is Al-Haqq coming from their Nourisher-Sustainer, He absolved them of their misdeeds and improved and reformed their state"
  47,3,This (is so) because those who disbelieved have followed Al-batil. And that those who Believed have followed Al-Haqq coming from their Nourisher-Sustainer. Thus Allah sets forth for mankind their similitudes
  47,4,"When you became interlocked (in an armed encounter) with those who disbelieved, then smiting the necks (becomes obligatory) until the stage when you have fully subdued them. Then firmly establish the process of arrest. Then if whatever generosity (is to be done, it would be done) later on; and if whatever ransom (is to be eccepted it also would process later on. Generosity or ransom do not apply) untill the war lays down its burdens (i.e., it has completely exhausted its fury). That (is the Law). And if Allah desires, He will surely implement retribution on them; but (He prefers a bitter fight) so that He may test some of you through some (others). And those who are slain in the Way of Allah — so He will never let their deeds be lost (or go in vain)"
  47,5,Soon He will guide them and set right their state
  47,6,and admit them to the Garden which He has fully introduced to them
  47,7,"O you people who have Believed! If you provide help to Allah, He will help you and make your footholds firm"
  47,8,"And those who have disbelieved, then for them is destruction and He allowed their deeds to follow a wrong track"
  47,9,This (happened) because they hated what Allah has sent down (as His Permanent Scripture); so He made their deeds go as waste
  47,10,"Have they not then travelled through the earth, so that they may watch what became the final end of those (who inhabited the earth) before these people? Allah made the destruction descend on these people; and for the disbelievers — similar to it"
  47,11,"This is because Allah is Maula (Protector, Ally, Helper, Master) of those who have Believed and as those who are disbelievers — there is no Maula for them"
