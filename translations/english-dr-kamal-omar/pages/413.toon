quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  31,20,"See you not (O men) that Allah has controlled and regulated for you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and has showered over you His Graces — apparent and evident as well as hidden and invisible? Yet of mankind is that who argues and disputes ‘in Allah’ without Ilm (‘Knowledge,’), and not (through) Hudah (‘Guidance’) and not (through) Kitabun Munir (‘A Light Emitting Book’)"
  31,21,"And when it is said to them: “Follow that which Allah has sent down,” they said: “Nay, we shall (only) follow that on which we found our fathers.” Would they then do so even if Satan invites them to the torment of the Fire"
  31,22,"And whosoever submits his face (i.e., personality) to Allah while he is a Muhsin then surely he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold. And towards Allah is the final end of (all) affairs"
  31,23,"And whoever disbelieved, then let not his disbelief grieve you. To Us is their returning place, then We will inform them about what they did. Surely, Allah is Well-Informed about the condition of (the hearts in) the chests"
  31,24,"We let them enjoy a little (during the life-span in this world), afterwards We shall drive them helpless and disowned to a severe torment (in the life of the Hereafter)"
  31,25,"And if you asked them who has created the heavens and the earth surely, they will say: “Allah”. Say: “Specified Praise suits Allah (Alone).” Nay, most of them know not"
  31,26,"To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Verily, Allah — He is the Self-Independent, the Immensely Praised"
  31,27,"And if (it so happened) that whatever is in the earth out of the trees (converted itself to produce) pens and the sea helps it (becoming ink, and) thereafter seven seas (come to its aid) — the statements of Allah have not (yet) completed. Surely, Allah (is) All-Mighty, All-Wise"
  31,28,"Neither your creation, and nor your resurrection (is) except like that of a single Nafs. Verily, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Seer"
