quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  21,11,"And how many a town We destroyed that were transgressors, and We raised up after them a nation of another people"
  21,12,"So as (and) when they perceived Our torment, behold: they (attempt to) flee from it"
  21,13,"Flee not! And return back to that wherein you lived a luxurious life and to your residences, in order that you may be questioned (at the time of destruction. Angels of death would put you to some questions when they take away life from your bodies)"
  21,14,"They said (to the angels of death): “Woe to us! Certainly, we have been Zalimun"
  21,15,"And that cry of theirs ceased not, till We made them as (a field) mowed down, reduced to ashes"
  21,16,"And We created not the heaven and the earth, and what is between the two, as those involved in play and sport"
  21,17,"Had We intended to find (a pasttime in) jest and sport, We would surely have found it in what is with Us if We happened to be (out of) those who do (such an act)"
  21,18,"Nay! We do target-shooting with the help of Al-Haqq (‘The Truth’) on the falsehood, so it knocks down its brain, so instantly it is one that vanishes. And woe to you for that you invent (as forgery and lies)"
  21,19,"And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who are near Him (i.e., the angels), do not show arrogance against paying obedience to Him and they do not indicate tiredness"
  21,20,They glorify (Him) night and day (and) they never slacken
  21,21,Or have the people picked up gods from the earth? Will they raise (the dead)
  21,22,"If there had been in these two (i.e., in the heavens and the earth) gods except Allah, surely both would have been under lawlessness and disruption. So, Allah be Glorified, the Nourisher-Sustainer of the Throne, above what they falsely attribute (to His Dominion)"
  21,23,He is not put to question regarding what He does but they would be questioned (about their deeds)
  21,24,"Have the people picked up gods besides Him? Say: “Bring forth your Burhan (‘The Criterion’ through which you filter your beliefs, concepts and deeds). This (which we possess as Burhan or Al-Kitab or Al-Qur’an) is (Allah’s) Zikr (‘Message’) for those with me and a Zikr (‘Message’) for those before me.” Nay! The majority of them know not Al-Haqq (‘The Truth’), so they show aversion (against Allah’s Scripture)"
