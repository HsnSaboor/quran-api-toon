quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  17,18,"Whosoever had been desiring an immediate gain, We hastened for him therein what We think proper — for whosoever We intend. Afterwards We appointed for him Hell. He will approach it disgraced, rejected"
  17,19,"And whoever desired the Hereafter and strove hard for it in the striving (needed for) it while he is a Believer, then these are the people; their striving became appreciated one (and rewarded one)"
  17,20,To all (the above mentioned two groups) We bestow — those as well as these — out of the bounty of your Nourisher-Sustainer. And the bounty of your Nourisher-Sustainer was not restricted (for any particular group)
  17,21,"Ponder, how We preferred and elevated some of them over some others, and verily, the Hereafter is greater in ranks and greater in preference in elevation"
  17,22,"Do not adopt alongwith Allah, another ilah (god or deity) lest you stay disgraced, forsaken"
  17,23,"And your Nourisher-Sustainer has given His (decision) that: ‘Do not pay obedience except to Him Alone; and with the parents — highly tender (behaviour). If one of them or both of them attain old age in your presence, then utter not to them a word of even mild disgust, and do not behave with those two even in mild disrespect and utter for those two a statement adorned with respect and honour"
  17,24,"And lower unto those two a wing of humility out of mercy and say: ‘My Nourisher-Sustainer! Bestow mercy on those two the way they nourished me (when I was) one, tender in age.”"
  17,25,"Your Nourisher-Sustainer knows better what is in your innerselves. If you become righteous, then surely, He is Oft-Forgiving to those who turn (to Him) again and again (in repentance and then obedience)"
  17,26,"And give to the close-relation what is his right, and to that who is indigent and the victim of travel and squander not (your wealth) extravagantly"
  17,27,"Verily, the spendthrift and extravagant ones are brothers of satans and Satan is ungrateful to his Nourisher-Sustainer"
