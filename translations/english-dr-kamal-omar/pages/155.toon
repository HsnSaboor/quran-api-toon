quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,38,"(Allah) said: “Enter you among (the company of the) Umam who definitely went before you — out of Jinn and mankind — in (Hell-) Fire. Every time an ummah entered (Hell-Fire) it cursed her sister (community), until when they settled therein — altogether, the latter of them said for their earlier one: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer! These very ones made us astray. So provide them more severe punishment out of the Fire.” (Allah) said: “To all (of you it is) more severe but you do not know.”"
  7,39,"And the earlier of them said to the latter among them: “So there is not for you, over us, out of a grace. So taste the punishment for what you had been earning (through your evil deeds and concepts).”"
  7,40,"Certainly those who belied Our Ayaat and became arrogant to them: shall not be opened to them the gates of the Heaven, and they shall not enter Paradise until the camel goes through the eye of the needle. And thus do We reward Mujrimun"
  7,41,For them is a bed of Hell-Fire as well as the shades over them. And thus do We reward the Zalimun
  7,42,And those who have Believed and have done righteous deeds — We tax not any Nafs except to her capacity — these are the companions of Paradise. They shall be dwellers therein
  7,43,"And We removed what (was) in their breasts (i.e., in their hearts) as ghill, rivers run and flow underneath them and they said: “Selective Praise suits (Only) Allah, Who has guided us for this. And it was not (for) us that we could have become guided (of our own) were it not that Allah had guided us. Indeed, the Messengers of Our Nourisher-Sustainer did come with Al-Haqq. And an announcement was made to them that: “This is the Paradise which you have inherited for what you used to do (in your deeds, concepts and behaviour).”"
