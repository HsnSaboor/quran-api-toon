  2,113,"And Al-Yahood (the Jews) said: “An-Nasaaraa have nothing definite to stand upon. ” And An-Nasaaraa said: “Al-Yahood have nothing definite to stand upon” although they recite Al-Kitab. Thus said those who do not know — similar to their statement. So Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they have been differing"
  2,114,"And who is more unjust than he who forbids that His name may be remembered in the Mosques of Allah; and he made efforts to damage them? Such people!

For them there is disgrace in this world, and for them there is a grievous punishment in the Hereafter"

  2,118,"And those who do not know said: “Why does not Allah speak to us (face to face) and why does not a sign come to us?” Thus said the people before them — similar to their utterance. Their hearts became similar (in approach). We have indeed explained the Ayaat for the nation who firmly Believe"
  2,119,Verily! We have sent you with Al-Haqq as a bearer of good news and as a warner. And you shall not be put to question about the dewellers of the blazing Fire
