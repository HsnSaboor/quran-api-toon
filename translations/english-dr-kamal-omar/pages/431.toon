quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,23,"And intercession does not profit (any one) before Him except in the interest of one for whom He permitted. Until when apprehension was removed from their hearts, they said (among themselves): “What is it (that) your Nourisher-Sustainer told (you)?” They said: “The Truth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great.”"
  34,24,"Say: “Who gives you provision from the heavens and the earth?” Say: “Allah, and verily, (either) we or you are truly on guidance, or in plain error.”"
  34,25,"Say: “You will not be asked about what we committed in crime, and nor shall we be asked of what you do.”"
  34,26,"Say: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer will assemble us, afterwards He will judge between us through Al-Haqq (‘The Truth’), and He is the Most Well-Informed Judge.”"
  34,27,"Say: “Show me those whom you have joined with Him as partners.\" Impossible! Rather, He is Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise"
  34,28,And We have not sent you but as one who is sufficient for mankind as a giver of glad tidings and as a warner. But the majority of mankind do not know (this fact and position)
  34,29,"And people say: “When this promise is to be fulfilled if you are truthful"
  34,30,"Say: “The appointment to you is for a Day you shall not detain yourselves regarding it by an hour, and you shall not advance (your arrival)"
  34,31,"And those who have disbelieved said: “We shall never Believe in accordance with this Al-Quran and nor according to that which is in between its two hands.\" [They Believe not in Al-Quran being propagated to them through the mouth of the Prophet, and nor in Al-Kitab which is already available. They realise that Al-Kitab is Permanent and they still reject it]. And if you could see when the tansgressors are those made to stand before their Nourisher-Sustainer — some of them will make the blaming statement revert to some (other amongst themselves). Those who were prevailed upon will say to those who behaved in arrogance: “If you people were not (there to mislead us), surely we would have been Believers.”"
