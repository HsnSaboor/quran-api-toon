quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  5,96,"Made lawful to you (is the pursuit of) water-game and its consumption as food — for the benefit of yourselves and one who is a traveller; and is made forbidden to you (the pursuit of) land-game as long as you happened to be those under prohibition (i.e., you are putting on Ehram or you are within the limits of Harem). And pay obedience to Allah, The Being — towards Him you shall be gathered back"
  5,97,"Allah has established the Ka’ba, the Sacred, protected and prohibited House as an Asylum and Rendesvous for mankind (for Hajj, Umra, Tawaf and Salat) and the protected month, and Al-Hadiya, and the garlands (that encircle the necks of gift-animals that are proceeding to the Ka’ba). This, (He has done) that you may know that Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and that Allah is All-Knower of each and every thing. [If one performs pre-Hajj Umra in Hajj-season and also attends Hajj, or breaks certain prohibitions related to Harem, Umra and Hajj, he has to offer animal-sacrifice]"
  5,98,"Realise that Allah is severe in retribution and that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"
  5,99,(There is) no (responsibility) on the Messenger except propagation and conveying (of the Message). And Allah Knows what you make evident and what you hide and conceal
  5,100,"Say: “Al-Khabith and At-Tayyib (clean, lawful and palatable) do not become equal, similar or equivalent even though the abundance of Al-Khabith may dazzle you. Pay obedience to Allah, O people of under-standing, so that you may prosper"
  5,101,"O you who have Believed! Do not ask about the matters (which) if made plain to you may cause you trouble. But if you put up a question about it while Al-Quran is being sent (to your heart and its statements are becoming evident on you and you are appreciating its teachings and concepts), it will become evident on you. Allah has overlooked it and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing"
  5,102,"Surely, brought up question about it, a nation before you; afterwards they became, because of it, as disbelievers (since they could not bear and digest the reply to their questions)"
  5,103,"Allah has not instituted things like Bahira, and neither Saiba and nor Wasila and nor Ham. But those people who have disbelieved invent against Allah lies and falsehood, and most of them do not use intellect (and hence accept and patronise fake and mythological beliefs, concepts and customs)"
