  36,28,"And We sent not against his nation after him a force of individuals from heaven, nor We had been those Who send (such forces on such occasions)"
  36,29,"It (i.e., the destructive force)] was not but an extra-ordinary wild sound, so then they (became) those who lay silent, dead and destroyed"
