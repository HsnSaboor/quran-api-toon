  39,32,"So, who is more unjust than that who forged a lie against Allah and belied As-Sidq (‘The Truth’) when it reached him? Is (there) not in Hell an abode for the disbelievers"
  39,33,"And he who has approached with As-Sidq and accepting it as truth he confirmed it: such people, they (very ones) are Al-Muttaqun"
  39,34,For them (is available) with their Nourisher-Sustainer what they shall desire. That is the reward for the Muhsinun —

  39,36,"Is not Allah Sufficient for His Abd? People create in you fear regarding those (who are regarded as deities) besides Him. And whom Allah lets go astray, then there is not for him out of (any) guide"
  39,37,"And whomsoever Allah guides, then there is not for him out of one who misleads. Is not Allah All-Mighty, Possessor of Retribution"
  39,38,"And surely, if you asked them: “Who created the heavens and the earth?” Definitely they will say: 'Allah'. Say: “Have you then pondered (about) what you invoke besides Allah?

In Him put (their) trust those who put (their) trust (in the Right Authority).”"

  39,40,"to whom comes a punishment that puts him to disgrace, and stays over him a lasting punishment"
