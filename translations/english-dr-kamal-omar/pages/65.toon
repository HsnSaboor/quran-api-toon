quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,116,"Surely, those who have rejected (acted against Al-Kitab): shall not profit them their possessions and nor their children, against Allah, in any way. And they are dwellers of the Fire. They, therein (shall be) dwellers"
  3,117,"The example of that which they spend in this immediate life is the example of a wind — in it is icy cold (effect): it struck the harvest of the nation who wronged their selves, so it destroyed it. And Allah did not deal unjustly with them; rather, they deal unjustly with their ownselves"
  3,118,"O you people who have Believed (in Al-Kitab)! Take not as Bitanah (confidant) from outside your own. They shall not fail in injecting corruption and vulgarity in you. They desired that which pained you. Their hatred (against Islam) has become evident from their facies. And whatever their chests conceal is more serious and dangerous. Certainly, We have made evident to you the signs (to understand the enemy) if you were using (your) intellect"
  3,119,"Lo! You are such people: you like them and they like you not; you Believe in Al-Kitab in its entire text. And when they met you they said: “We have Believed.” And when they attained privacy they bit, out of hatred against you, the tips of (their) fingers, in rage. Say: “Perish in your rage. Certainly, Allah is All-Aware with the state (of hearts) in the chests.”"
  3,120,"If a good befalls you, it grieves them; and if an evil overtakes you, they rejoice over it. And if you remain patient and remain in obedience, their planning shall not do you any harm. Surely, Allah is All-Vigilant and Watchful on what they do"
  3,121,"And (bring to mind) when you departed from your family-members: you are assigning to the Believers (their) positions for battle. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower"
