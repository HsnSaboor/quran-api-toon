quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  10,43,And among them is that who looks at you. Could then you give guidance to the blind even though they had not been using (their) sight
  10,44,Truly! Allah wrongs not mankind to any extent but mankind wrong their own selves
  10,45,"And the Day He gathers them as if they stayed not except an hour of a day. They will recognise each other amongst them. Definitely, got ruined those who denied the meeting with Allah and they did not become guided"
  10,46,And whether We show you (in your lifetime) some of what We promise them or We cause you to die — then unto Us is their returning place. Further on Allah is a Witness over what they do
  10,47,"And to every Ummah (there is) a Messenger. So when their Messenger has come, (their case) got settled amongst them in justice. And they will not be wronged"
  10,48,"And they say: “When this Promise (will be implemented) if you are those who speak the truth?”"
  10,49,"Say: “I possess no power of harm, and nor of benefit for my Nafs except what Allah thought proper. For every Ummah (there is) a term appointed. When their appointed term approached, then they do not delay by an hour and nor they advance (even a moment).”"
  10,50,"Say: “Have you (ever) pondered if His punishment reached you by night or by day? What is that portion thereof the Mujrimun make haste (for that)"
  10,51,"Whether at that time when, what has already befallen, you developed Faith therein? What (happened to you? Is it) at this stage (that you have developed your Belief?) And indeed, you used to hasten it on (to yourself).”"
  10,52,"Then it was said to those who transgressed: “Taste you the everlasting punishment. Would you be rewarded (any thing else) except what you used to earn?”"
  10,53,"And they ask you for opinion and interpretation: “Whether it (i.e., the Day of Resurrection and punishment and reward therein) is a reality?” Say: “Of course! My Nourisher-Sustainer is (Himself) The Witness. Definitely, it is a sure reality and you are not of those who can obstruct (its appearance).”"
