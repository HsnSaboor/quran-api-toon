  75,32,But (on the contrary) he belied (the Scripture) and bypassed (it)
  75,33,then he walked to his family and followers — he exhibits pride and arrogance
  75,34,Woe to you (who feel self-pride in hypocrisy and disbelief)! So (again) woe (to you)
  75,35,"Another time, woe to you! So (again) woe (to you)"
