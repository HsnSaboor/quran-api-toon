quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,1,"They ask you about Al-Anfal. Say: “Al-Anfal should go to Allah and the Messenger.” So obey Allah and reform the weaknesses pertaining to and existing amongst your own people. And obey Allah and His Messenger if you happen to be Believers"
  8,2,"Definitely, it is that the Believers are those (who), when Allah is mentioned, their hearts trembled and when His Ayaat are reproduced before them, they (i.e., the Ayaat) increased them in Faith, and on their Nourisher-Sustainer they put their trust"
  8,3,"those who establish As-Salat, and out of what We have given to them they spend"
  8,4,Those people! They very ones are the Believers in reality. For them are ranks of dignity with their Nourisher-Sustainer as well as forgiveness and a generous provision
  8,5,"It was with this intention that your Nourisher-Sustainer made you leave your home on the side of justice, and verily, a section among the Believers had been disinclined (to this move)"
  8,6,"They dispute and argue with you about justice, after what became fully evident, as if they are being driven to death and they are loohead of state (directly at it)"
  8,7,"And (bring to mind) when Allah promises you one of the two groups that such and such is for you (to be faced in encounter), and you people desired that the unprepared one may be for you (to be faced in encounter). And Allah intends that He may fully prove the Truth with the help of His Statements, and He may cut off the root of the disbelievers"
  8,8,So that He may prove the Truth to be true and He may nullify the falsehood even though the Mujrimun felt disinclination
