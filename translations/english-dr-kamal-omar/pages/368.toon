  26,20,"(Musa) said: “I did it while: and I (was) of the ignorants (— not fully conversant with the Divine Message)"
  26,21,"So I fled from you when I feared you. Then my Nourisher-Sustainer bestowed me Hukman (‘Verdict, Order or Ordainment’. This is an attribute for Allah’s Book) and appointed me (as one) of the Messengers"
  26,22,And this is the favour for which you taunt me — that you have kept Bani Israiel in bondage?”
  26,23,"Firaun said: “And what (is meant by the term) Rabb-ul-Alamin?”"
  26,24,"(Musa) said: “Nourisher-Sustainer to the heavens and the earth and whatever is between those two — if you be those who become convinced.”"
  26,25,"(Firaun) said to those around him: “Do you not hear?”"
  26,26,"(Musa further) said: “Nourisher-Sustainer to you people, and Nourisher-Sustainer to your initial fathers (who initiated your dynasty)!”"
  26,27,"(Firaun) said: “Surely your Messenger who has been sent to you indeed (appears to be) a fanatic"
  26,28,"(Musa continued and) said: “Nourisher-Sustainer for the east and the west and whatever is between those two if you had been using intellect.”"

  26,35,"He intends that he may expel you from your land through his sorcery, then what it is that you advise (for orders)?”"
  26,36,"They said: “Put him off and his brother (for a while), and send callers for the cities"
  26,37,They shall return to you with all the expert sorcerers.”
