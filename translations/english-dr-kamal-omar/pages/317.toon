quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  20,77,"And surely, indeed, We inspired Musa that: “Move with My Ibad and strike for them a path in the sea — a dry (path). You shall not fear being overtaken (by Firaun and his military forces) and you shall not feel afraid (of being drowned)"
  20,78,"Then Firaun chased them with his military forces, but completely covered them from (the contents of) the sea, whatever covered them (i.e., the sea-waters completely overwhelmed and drowned the forces)"
  20,79,And Firaun misled his nation and did not provide (them) a correct approach
  20,80,"O Bani Israiel! Indeed We rescued you from your enemy and We made you a Promise by the side of the Blessed Mount, and We sent down to you Al-Manna and As-Salwah"
  20,81,"Eat of the Tayyibat wherewith We have given you provisions and commit no transgression therein, lest My Punishment becomes due on you; and that one whom My Punishment becomes justly due, then indeed, he perished"
  20,82,"And verily, I am indeed Forgiving to that who repented and accepted Faith and did righteous deed (and) afterwards stayed in guidance"
  20,83,"And what made you hasten from your nation, O Musa"
  20,84,"(Musa) said: “They, those people are stichead of state to my teachings, and I hastened to You, my Nourisher-Sustainer, that You might be pleased.”"
  20,85,"(Allah) said: “So, verily, We indeed put your nation in a test after you (left them) and As-Samiri has led them astray.”"
  20,86,"So Musa returned back to his nation, full of anger, in sorrow. He said: “O my nation! Did not your Nourisher-Sustainer promise you an excellent promise? Did then appear to you delayed, the promise, or did you intend that should become justly due on you a punishment from your Nourisher-Sustainer — so you broke your promise to me?”"
  20,87,"The people said: “We broke not the promise to you of our own will, but we were made to carry the weight of the adornments of the nation, we unburdened that, and thus suggested As-Samiri.”"
