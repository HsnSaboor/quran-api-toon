quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  26,112,"He said: “And what is my knowledge about what they used to do"
  26,113,Their accountability is not (the responsibility) except of my Nourisher-Sustainer if you do understand
  26,114,And I am not that who drives away the Believers
  26,115,I am not but a plain warner
  26,116,"They said: “Truly, if you do not stop (your way of propagating and preaching), O Nuh! You will surely be of those who have been rejected and expelled.”"
  26,117,"He said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Verily, my nation has belied me"
  26,118,"Therefore pronounce You, between me and between them judgement and rescue me and whosoever is with me out of the Believers.”"
  26,119,So We saved him and those with him in the fully loaded Ark
  26,120,"Then We drowned thereafter, the rest"
  26,121,"Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not Believers"
  26,122,"And verily, your Nourisher-Sustainer: truly, He is the All-Mighty, the continuously Merciful"
  26,123,’Ad (people) belied the Messengers
  26,124,"when their brother Hud said to them: “Will you not pay obedience (to Allah)"
  26,125,"Verily, I am to you a trustworthy Messenger"
  26,126,So pay obedience to Allah and obey me
  26,127,And I do not ask you for this any reward. My reward is not due except with the Nourisher-Sustainer to the worlds
  26,128,Do you build on every prominent place a monument? You act uselessly (seehead of state vain glory)
  26,129,And you establish industrial units as if you will stay (in the world) permanently
  26,130,And when you persecuted you persecuted as tyrants
  26,131,So pay obedience to Allah and obey me
  26,132,And pay obedience to Him Who has helped you through that which you (very well) know
  26,133,He has helped you with cattle and children
  26,134,and gardens and springs
  26,135,"Verily, I fear against you a torment of a Great Day"
  26,136,"They said: “It is same to us whether you gave (us) a sermon or be not of those who give sermons"
