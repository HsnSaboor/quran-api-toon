quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  21,58,"So he (i.e., Ibrahim) made them into pieces except the Most High and Most Great to them so that they may turn to Him (Alone) in devotion"
  21,59,"They said: “Who has done this with our aaliha (gods)? Certainly he must be out of the wrong-doers.”"
  21,60,"(Some) people said: “We have heard a young man: he discussed them, and he is called Ibrahim"
  21,61,"People said: “So come with him (i.e., bring him) before the eyes of the people, so that they may testify.”"
  21,62,"They said: “Are you — you have done this with our gods, O Ibrahim?”"
  21,63,"(Ibrahim) said: “Nay, this Most High and Most Great of them has done it. Ask them (who are here with broken hands, broken legs and broken faces) if they used to talk (in the past as you claim)"
  21,64,"So they turned to themselves (for secret counselling), then said: “Surely, you! You yourself are the Zalimun (transgressors, wrong-doers).”"
  21,65,"As an effect they were compelled to lower down their heads in humiliation (saying): “Surely, indeed, you (O Ibrahim) knew that these do not talk (either to us or to themselves).”"
  21,66,"(Ibrahim) said: “Do you then worship besides Allah that which does not benefit you to any extent and does not harm you (in any way)"
  21,67,"Fie upon you, and upon that which you worship besides Allah. Would you then not use your senses?”"
  21,68,"(The aggressive and crude ones, becoming emotional and retributive) said: “Put him on fire, and provide help to your gods if you are those who can do (something).”"
  21,69,"We (Allah) said: “O fire! Be you cool and safety over Ibrahim"
  21,70,And they intended against him a plan but We made them the worst losers
  21,71,And We rescued him and Lout to the land wherein We kept Our blessings for the worlds
  21,72,And We bestowed upon him Ishaque and Yaqub as an additional (gift); and all (of them) We made righteous ones
