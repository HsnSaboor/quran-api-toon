quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,"And O my nation! I do not ask you for it [i.e., for propagating the Statements of Al-Kitab to you direct (any of your)] possessions or wealth (as a worldly benefit). (There is) not a reward for me (with any one) except upon Allah, and I am not one who drives away those who have developed Faith. Surely, they are those who shall meet their Nourisher-Sustainer. Rather I mark you people as a nation who commit ignorance"
  11,30,And O my nation! Who will provide me assistance against Allah if I drove them away? Will you not then give a thought
  11,31,"And I do not say to you that with me are the treasures of Allah, and I am not aware of the unseen or the hidden; and I do not say that I am indeed an angel, and I do not say of those whom your eyes look down upon (as an inferior people) that Allah will never bestow over them any good. Allah knows better what is in their inner selves. Definitely I, in such a situation (if I drive away those whom you feel inferior), will surely be out of the transgressors.”"
  11,32,"They said: “O Nuh! Indeed, you have indulged in arguments with us, then you have extended (beyond expectations) our disputes: so approach us with what you have promised us if you are out of those who speak the truth.”"
  11,33,"(Nuh) said: “Definitely it is that Allah will come to you with it if He thought proper and you are not those who can frustrate (Allah’s plans)"
  11,34,"And my advice will not give you (any) benefit if I wished that I give you sincere advice, if Allah is (the One Who) intends that He may make you go astray. He is your Nourisher-Sustainer, and to Him you shall return"
  11,35,"Do they say: “He has fabricated it (i.e., Al-Kitab)?” Say: “If I have fabricated it then upon me be my crimes and I am absolved of what you commit in crimes.”"
  11,36,"And inspiration was sent to Nuh that it (i.e., the situation is): “Never will Believe any of your nation except one who has already Believed. So be not sad because of what they had been doing (in their deeds)"
  11,37,"And construct the Ark under Our Eyes and under Our Inspiration, and address Me not on behalf of those who have transgressed; surely they stand drowned.”"
