quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,43,"A community does not anticipate its appointed term, and they do not delay (it)"
  23,44,"Then We sent Our Messengers in succession one after another. Every time there came to a community her Messenger, they denied him. So We made them follow one another (to destruction) and We made them mere tales. So (there is) a barrier of distance (from Mercy) for the nation who do not accept Faith"
  23,45,Then We sent Musa and his brother Harun with Our Signs and Evident Power
  23,46,to Firaun and his chiefs but they behaved arrogantly. And they were a nation regarding themselves Aaleen (superior to others — self-exalting ones)
  23,47,"Then they said: “Shall we Believe for the sake of two humans like ourselves while the nation of those two are subservient to us in humility"
  23,48,So they denied them both and they became of those who were destroyed
  23,49,"And surely, indeed We gave Musa Al-Kitab, that they may be guided"
  23,50,And We made the son of Maryam and his mother as a Sign and We settled them both on a hill-resort suitable for retiring and (having) flowing streams
  23,51,"O you Messengers! Eat of At-Tayyibat and perform righteous deeds. Verily, I am Well-Aware with what you do"
  23,52,"And verily, this community of you (all Messengers) is one single community, and I am Nourisher-Sustainer to you (all), so pay obedience to Me"
  23,53,"But the people cut off their affair amongst them into splinter-groups (or sects); all groups, what is in their possession (i.e., man-written, sectarian-literature) are rejoicers (therein)"
  23,54,So leave them in their confusion for a while
  23,55,"Do they think that (it is) so, that We are enriching them thereby in wealth and children"
  23,56,"(and thereby) We hasten unto them (their efforts) in (gaining) good? Nay, they perceive not"
  23,57,"Certainly, those: they out of reverance to their Nourisher-Sustainer are fully sincere"
  23,58,"and those: they Believe in the Ayaat of their Nourisher-Sustainer"
  23,59,"and those: they do not set up partners to their Nourisher-Sustainer"
