quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"(they are) such people who wait and watch about you. If (there) happened for you a victory from Allah, they said: “Were we not with you?” And if (there) happened for the disbelievers a share (in victory), they said: “Were we not getting advantage over you and were we not shielding you against the Believers?” So Allah will give decision about you (all) on the Day of Resurrection. And certainly Allah will not sanction the disbelievers a way (of triumph or victory) over the Believers"
  4,142,"Verily, the hypocrites (think) they deceive Allah; rather, He lets them remain deceived. And when they stood up for Salat, they stood up in laziness; they (make a) show to the people; and they do not glorify Allah but very little —"
  4,143,"wavering-ones between this (state of faith cum infidelity), neither adhering to these and nor adhering to them. And whom Allah sends astray then certainly, you will not find for him a way (to Islam)"
  4,144,"O you peope who have Believed! Do not pickup disbelievers as auliya instead of Believers. Would you wish that you may put up to Allah, against yourself a proof quite evident and manifest"
  4,145,"Without doubt, the hypocrites (will go) in the deeper chamber (or cell) of the Fire; and surely you shall not find for them a helper —"
  4,146,"except those who aboutturned (and parted with hypocrisy) and reformed (their Beliefs and actions) and they attached (themselves) to Allah and they purified their Religion in relation to Allah, then they (are) in company of the Believers. And soon, Allah will bestow on the Believers a momentous reward"
  4,147,"What does Allah (gain) through your punishment if you have thanked (Him) and have accepted Faith? And Allah is All-Appreciative, All-Knowing"
