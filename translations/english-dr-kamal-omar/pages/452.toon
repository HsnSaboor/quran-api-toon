quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you? How do you judge
  37,155,Will you not then remind (yourselves and remind the others)
  37,156,Or is there for you a ‘Sultanun Mobin’ (‘Evident Authority’. This term is applied as an attribute to Allah’s Book)
  37,157,"(If it is so), then come forward with your Book if you happen to be truthful individuals"
  37,158,"And (the misguided) people have invented between Him and between jinns a genealogical link, although surely, indeed the jinns knew (that) out of a certainty they will surely be those who have been brought (before Allah for Accountability)"
  37,159,Glorified be Allah from what they attribute (unto Him)
  37,160,except Ibad of Allah who were cleansed and sanctified
  37,161,"So verily, you (disbelievers) and what you worship —"
  37,162,"you are not unto him (i.e., unto a cleansed and sanctified Abd of Allah) as Fateneen [those who will put a person in doubt and suspicion (against Al-Kitab]"
  37,163,except that one who is about to approach Hell-Fire
  37,164,"(And the angels say): “There is not one out of us but for him is a known place"
  37,165,"And verily we, indeed we are those who stand in rows"
  37,166,"And verily we, indeed we are those who glorify"
  37,167,And they (disbelievers in Allah’s Book) used to indeed say
  37,168,“If (it be) that (there is available) unto us Zikr (‘Message’) moving down from the earlier people
  37,169,we would have indeed been Ibad of Allah who are cleansed and sanctified.”
  37,170,"But (now when Allah’s Book is again in its Original and under active propagation), they have disbelieved therein; so very soon they will know (the ultimate result)"
  37,171,"And surely, indeed, Our Statement stands issued regarding Our Ibad — the Messengers"
  37,172,"verily they, indeed they will be those who have received help"
  37,173,And certainly it is Our Regiments (and forces) — indeed they (shall be) victorious
  37,174,So turn away from them for a while
  37,175,but keep a watch over them; then soon they will (also) see
  37,176,Do they then seek to hasten on Our Torment
  37,177,"So when it has already descended into their courtyard, then the morning of those who had been warned (in advance) turned into something evil"
  37,178,So turn away from them for a while
  37,179,but keep a watch; then soon they will (also) see
  37,180,"Exalted and Absolved is your Nourisher-Sustainer, the Nourisher-Sustainer in Honour (and Majesty) from what people attribute (as partners unto Him)"
  37,181,"And 'Salamun [peace (and blessings be)] on the Messengers"
  37,182,"And selective Praise suits Allah (Alone), Nourisher-Sustainer to the worlds"
