quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  68,16,Soon We shall brand him (hot) over the nose
  68,17,"Verily, We have subjected them to retribution in the same way as We subjected to retribution the ‘owners of the garden’ when they swore: definitely they shall pluck its fruits (as soon as they are) those who face the dawn"
  68,18,"and they make no exception or reservation [i.e., did not utter the words Insha Allaho (if Allah Willed]"
  68,19,Then moved over this (garden) a swiftly moving (torment) proceeding from your Nourisher-Sustainer while they were those who are asleep
  68,20,so (the garden) became by the early dawn as one whose fruit is completely plucked out
  68,21,Then they called out to one another (as soon as they were) those who face the dawn
  68,22,"that: “Move on to your tilth early morning if you be those who pluck the fruits. ”"
  68,23,"So they moved, and they talk among themselves in low tone"
  68,24,"that: “Shall not enter this (garden), this day, in your presence, any of the indigent one (who may expect a share in our produce).”"
  68,25,And they moved very early in the morning (thinhead of state themselves to be) those who are very capable over (implementing their desired) prohibition
  68,26,"But when they saw that (garden), they said: “Verily we are indeed those who have lost the track"
  68,27,Nay! We are those who stand deprived (of our own produce).”
  68,28,"One more just among them said: “Did I not tell you why don’t you glorify (Allah by adopting the teachings of His Al-Kitab) ?”"
  68,29,"They said: “Glory be to our Nourisher-Sustainer! Surely we, we (ourselves) had been transgressors.”"
  68,30,"Then some of them came face to face to some (others of them): they blame one another"
  68,31,"They said: “Oh, woe to us! Surely we, we (ourselves) had been disobedient arrogants"
  68,32,"May be our Nourisher-Sustainer (takes us in mercy and) that He may give instead (an orchard) better than that (which He decided to put in ruins). Truly we, to our Nourisher-Sustainer, (become) those who attach (themselves to His Path).”"
  68,33,"Like this (comes) the punishment (from Allah in this very world); and indeed the punishment in the Hereafter is greater, provided the people had been knowing (such facts of existence)"
  68,34,"Verily, for the Muttaqun: with their Nourisher-Sustainer (are) Gardens of Delight"
  68,35,Shall We then treat Al-Muslimun like Al-Mujrimun
  68,36,What (is the matter) with you? How do you judge
  68,37,Is for you a book in which you take lesson
  68,38,"Then certainly, for you therein is indeed (all such material) which you judge as better"
  68,39,"Are unto you written therein commitments on My behalf extending to the Day of Resurrection — (that) certainly (are) in your interest, indeed, whatsoever you judge"
  68,40,"Ask them, who of them stands as a surety for that"
  68,41,"Or, for them are ‘partners’ (in the Dominion of Allah)? Then let them come with their ‘partners’ if they became those who speak the truth"
