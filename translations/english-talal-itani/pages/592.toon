quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,But you prefer the present life
  87,17,"Though the Hereafter is better, and more lasting"
  87,18,This is in the former scriptures
  87,19,The Scriptures of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Has there come to you the news of the overwhelming
  88,2,Faces on that Day will be shamed
  88,3,Laboring and exhausted
  88,4,Roasting in a scorching Fire
  88,5,Given to drink from a flaming spring
  88,6,They will have no food except thorns
  88,7,"That neither nourishes, nor satisfies hunger"
  88,8,Faces on that Day will be joyful
  88,9,Satisfied with their endeavor
  88,10,In a lofty Garden
  88,11,In it you will hear no nonsense
  88,12,In it is a flowing spring
  88,13,In it are raised beds
  88,14,And cups set in place
  88,15,And cushions set in rows
  88,16,And carpets spread around
  88,17,Do they not look at the camels—how they are created
  88,18,And at the sky—how it is raised
  88,19,And at the mountains—how they are installed
  88,20,And at the earth—how it is spread out
  88,21,So remind. You are only a reminder
  88,22,You have no control over them
  88,23,But whoever turns away and disbelieves
  88,24,God will punish him with the greatest punishment
  88,25,To Us is their return
  88,26,Then upon Us rests their reckoning
