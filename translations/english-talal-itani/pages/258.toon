  14,20,And that is not difficult for God
  14,21,"They will emerge before God, altogether. The weak will say to those who were proud, “We were your followers, can you protect us at all against God’s punishment?” They will say, “Had God guided us, we would have guided you. It is the same for us; whether we mourn, or are patient; there is no asylum for us.”"
  14,22,"And Satan will say, when the issue is settled, “God has promised you the promise of truth, and I promised you, but I failed you. I had no authority over you, except that I called you, and you answered me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves. I cannot come to your aid, nor can you come to my aid. I reject your associating with me in the past. The wrongdoers will have a torment most painful.”"
  14,23,"But those who believed and did good deeds will be admitted into gardens beneath which rivers flow, to remain therein forever, by leave of their Lord. Their greeting therein will be: “Peace.”"
  14,24,"Do you not see how God presents a parable? A good word is like a good tree—its root is firm, and its branches are in the sky"
