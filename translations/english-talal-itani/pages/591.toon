quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the sky and at-Tariq
  86,2,But what will let you know what at-Tariq is
  86,3,The Piercing Star
  86,4,There is no soul without a Protector over it
  86,5,Let man consider what he was created from
  86,6,He was created from gushing liquid
  86,7,Issuing from between the backbone and the breastbones
  86,8,He is certainly able to return him
  86,9,On the Day when the secrets are disclosed
  86,10,"He will have no strength, and no supporter"
  86,11,By the sky that returns
  86,12,And the earth that cracks open
  86,13,It is a Decisive Word
  86,14,It is no joke
  86,15,They plot and scheme
  86,16,But I plot and scheme
  86,17,"Therefore, give the blasphemers respite, a brief respite"
  87,1,"Praise the Name of your Lord, the Most High"
  87,2,He who creates and regulates
  87,3,He who measures and guides
  87,4,He who produces the pasture
  87,5,And then turns it into light debris
  87,6,"We will make you read, so do not forget"
  87,7,"Except what God wills. He knows what is declared, and what is hidden"
  87,8,We will ease you into the Easy Way
  87,9,"So remind, if reminding helps"
  87,10,The reverent will remember
  87,11,But the wretched will avoid it
  87,12,He who will enter the Gigantic Fire
  87,13,"Where he will neither die, nor live"
  87,14,Successful is he who purifies himself
  87,15,"And mentions the name of his Lord, and prays"
