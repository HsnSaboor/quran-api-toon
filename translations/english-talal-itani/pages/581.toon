quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Did We not create you from an insignificant fluid
  77,21,Then lodged it in a secure place
  77,22,For a known term
  77,23,We measured precisely. We are the best to measure
  77,24,Woe on that Day to the falsifiers
  77,25,Did We not make the earth a homestead
  77,26,For the living and the dead
  77,27,"And set on it lofty mountains, and given you pure water to drink"
  77,28,Woe on that Day to the deniers
  77,29,“Proceed to what you used to deny.”
  77,30,“Proceed to a shadow of three different masses.”
  77,31,"Offering no shade, and unavailing against the flames"
  77,32,It shoots sparks as castles
  77,33,As if they were yellow camels
  77,34,Woe on that Day to the liars
  77,35,This is a Day when they will not speak
  77,36,And they will not be allowed to apologize
  77,37,Woe on that Day to the rejecters
  77,38,"This is the Day of Separation; We have gathered you, together with the ancients"
  77,39,"So if you have a strategy, use it against Me"
  77,40,Woe on that Day to the falsifiers
  77,41,The righteous will be amidst shades and fountains
  77,42,And fruits as they desire
  77,43,"“Eat and drink pleasantly, for what you used to do.”"
  77,44,This is how We reward the doers of good
  77,45,Woe on that Day to the deniers
  77,46,“Eat and enjoy yourselves a little; you are indeed criminals.”
  77,47,Woe on that Day to the liars
  77,48,"And when it is said to them, “Kneel”, they do not kneel"
  77,49,Woe on that Day to the rejecters
  77,50,"In what message, beyond this, will they believe"
