  77,1,By those unleashed in succession
  77,2,Storming turbulently
  77,3,Scattering far and wide
  77,4,Separating decisively
  77,5,Delivering a message
  77,6,Excusing or warning
  77,7,Surely what you are promised will happen
  77,8,When the stars are obliterated
  77,9,And the sky is fractured
  77,10,And the mountains are blown away
  77,11,And the messengers are alerted
  77,12,Until which day is it deferred
  77,13,Until the Day of Decision
  77,14,And what will teach you what the Day of Decision is
  77,15,Woe on that Day to the liars
  77,16,Did We not destroy the ancients
  77,17,Then succeeded them with the others
  77,18,This is how We deal with the guilty
  77,19,Woe on that Day to the rejecters
