  26,40,"That we may follow the magicians, if they are the winners.”"
  26,41,"When the magicians arrived, they said to Pharaoh, “Is there a reward for us, if we are the winners?”"
  26,42,"He said, “Yes, and you will be among those favored.”"
  26,43,"Moses said to them, “Present what you intend to present.”"
  26,44,"So they threw their ropes and their sticks, and said, “By the majesty of Pharaoh, we will be the winners.”"
  26,45,"Then Moses threw his staff, and behold, it began swallowing their trickery"
  26,46,And the magicians fell down prostrating
  26,47,"They said, “We have believed in the Lord of the Worlds"
  26,48,The Lord of Moses and Aaron.”
  26,49,"He said, “Did you believe in Him before I have given you permission? He must be your chief, who taught you magic. You will soon know. I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you all.”"
  26,50,"They said, “No problem. To our Lord we will return"
  26,51,"We are eager for our Lord to forgive us our sins, since we are the first of the believers.”"
  26,52,"And We inspired Moses: “Travel with My servants by night. You will be followed.”"
  26,53,Pharaoh sent heralds to the cities
  26,54,“These are a small gang
  26,55,And they are enraging us
  26,56,But we are a vigilant multitude.”
  26,57,So We drove them out of gardens and springs
  26,58,And treasures and noble dwellings
  26,59,So it was. And We made the Children of Israel inherit them
  26,60,And they pursued them at sunrise
