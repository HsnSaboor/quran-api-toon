quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,Those who do not believe in the Hereafter give the angels the names of females
  53,28,"They have no knowledge of that. They only follow assumptions, and assumptions are no substitute for the truth"
  53,29,"So avoid him who has turned away from Our remembrance, and desires nothing but the present life"
  53,30,"That is the extent of their knowledge. Your Lord knows best who has strayed from His path, and He knows best who has accepted guidance"
  53,31,"To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth. He will repay those who do evil according to their deeds, and recompense those who do good with the best"
  53,32,"Those who avoid gross sins and indecencies—except for minor lapses—your Lord is of Vast Forgiveness. He knows you well, ever since He created you from the earth, and ever since you were embryos in your mothers’ wombs. So do not acclaim your own virtue; He is fully aware of the righteous"
  53,33,Have you considered him who turned away
  53,34,"And gave a little, and held back"
  53,35,"Does he possess knowledge of the unseen, and can therefore foresee"
  53,36,Or was he not informed of what is in the Scrolls of Moses
  53,37,"And of Abraham, who fulfilled"
  53,38,That no soul bears the burdens of another soul
  53,39,And that the human being attains only what he strives for
  53,40,And that his efforts will be witnessed
  53,41,Then he will be rewarded for it the fullest reward
  53,42,And that to your Lord is the finality
  53,43,And that it is He who causes laughter and weeping
  53,44,And that it is He who gives death and life
