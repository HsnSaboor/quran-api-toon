quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the daybreak
  89,2,And ten nights
  89,3,And the even and the odd
  89,4,And the night as it recedes
  89,5,Is there in this an oath for a rational person
  89,6,Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with Aad
  89,7,Erum of the pillars
  89,8,The like of which was never created in the land
  89,9,And Thamood—those who carved the rocks in the valley
  89,10,And Pharaoh of the Stakes
  89,11,Those who committed excesses in the lands
  89,12,And spread much corruption therein
  89,13,So your Lord poured down upon them a scourge of punishment
  89,14,Your Lord is on the lookout
  89,15,"As for man, whenever his Lord tests him, and honors him, and prospers him, he says, “My Lord has honored me.”"
  89,16,"But whenever He tests him, and restricts his livelihood for him, he says, “My Lord has insulted me.”"
  89,17,Not at all. But you do not honor the orphan
  89,18,And you do not urge the feeding of the poor
  89,19,And you devour inheritance with all greed
  89,20,And you love wealth with immense love
  89,21,"No—when the earth is leveled, pounded, and crushed"
  89,22,"And your Lord comes, with the angels, row after row"
  89,23,"And on that Day, Hell is brought forward. On that Day, man will remember, but how will remembrance avail him"
