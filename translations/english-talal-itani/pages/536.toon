  56,51,"Then you, you misguided, who deny the truth"
  56,52,Will be eating from the Tree of Bitterness
  56,53,Will be filling your bellies with it
  56,54,Will be drinking on top of it boiling water
  56,55,Drinking like thirsty camels drink
  56,56,That is their hospitality on the Day of Retribution
