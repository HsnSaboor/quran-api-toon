quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun is rolled up
  81,2,When the stars are dimmed
  81,3,When the mountains are set in motion
  81,4,When the relationships are suspended
  81,5,When the beasts are gathered
  81,6,When the oceans are set aflame
  81,7,When the souls are paired
  81,8,"When the girl, buried alive, is asked"
  81,9,For what crime was she killed
  81,10,When the records are made public
  81,11,When the sky is peeled away
  81,12,When the Fire is set ablaze
  81,13,When Paradise is brought near
  81,14,Each soul will know what it has readied
  81,15,I swear by the galaxies
  81,16,Precisely running their courses
  81,17,And by the night as it recedes
  81,18,And by the morn as it breathes
  81,19,This is the speech of a noble messenger
  81,20,"Endowed with power, eminent with the Lord of the Throne"
  81,21,Obeyed and honest
  81,22,Your friend is not possessed
  81,23,He saw him on the luminous horizon
  81,24,And He does not withhold knowledge of the Unseen
  81,25,And it is not the word of an accursed devil
  81,26,So where are you heading
  81,27,It is only a Reminder to all mankind
  81,28,To whoever of you wills to go straight
  81,29,"But you cannot will, unless God wills—The Lord of the Worlds"
