quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,"And Our command is but once, like the twinkling of an eye"
  54,51,We have destroyed your likes. Is there anyone who would ponder
  54,52,Everything they have done is in the Books
  54,53,"Everything, small or large, is written down"
  54,54,The righteous will be amidst gardens and rivers
  54,55,"In an assembly of virtue, in the presence of an Omnipotent King"
  55,1,The Compassionate
  55,2,Has taught the Quran
  55,3,He created man
  55,4,And taught him clear expression
  55,5,The sun and the moon move according to plan
  55,6,And the stars and the trees prostrate themselves
  55,7,"And the sky, He raised; and He set up the balance"
  55,8,So do not transgress in the balance
  55,9,"But maintain the weights with justice, and do not violate the balance"
  55,10,And the earth; He set up for the creatures
  55,11,"In it are fruits, and palms in clusters"
  55,12,"And grains in the blades, and fragrant plants"
  55,13,So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny
  55,14,"He created man from hard clay, like bricks"
  55,15,And created the jinn from a fusion of fire
  55,16,So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny
