quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,It is a noble Quran
  56,78,In a well-protected Book
  56,79,None can grasp it except the purified
  56,80,A revelation from the Lord of the Worlds
  56,81,Is it this discourse that you take so lightly
  56,82,And you make it your livelihood to deny it
  56,83,So when it has reached the throat
  56,84,As you are looking on
  56,85,"We are nearer to it than you are, but you do not see"
  56,86,If you are not held to account
  56,87,"Then bring it back, if you are truthful"
  56,88,But if he is one of those brought near
  56,89,"Then happiness, and flowers, and Garden of Delights"
  56,90,And if he is one of those on the Right
  56,91,"Then, “Peace upon you,” from those on the Right"
  56,92,"But if he is one of the deniers, the mistaken"
  56,93,Then a welcome of Inferno
  56,94,And burning in Hell
  56,95,This is the certain truth
  56,96,"So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Magnificent"
  57,1,"Glorifying God is everything in the heavens and the earth. He is the Almighty, the Wise"
  57,2,"To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death, and He has power over all things"
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last, and the Outer and the Inner, and He has knowledge of all things"
