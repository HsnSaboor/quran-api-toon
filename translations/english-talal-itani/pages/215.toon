quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,54,"Had every soul which had done wrong possessed everything on earth, it would offer it as a ransom. They will hide the remorse when they witness the suffering, and it will be judged between them equitably, and they will not be wronged"
  10,55,"Assuredly, to God belongs everything in the heavens and the earth. Assuredly, the promise of God is true. But most of them do not know"
  10,56,"He gives life and causes death, and to Him you will be returned"
  10,57,"O people! There has come to you advice from your Lord, and healing for what is in the hearts, and guidance and mercy for the believers"
  10,58,"Say, “In God’s grace and mercy let them rejoice. That is better than what they hoard.”"
  10,59,"Say, “Have you considered the sustenance God has sent down for you, some of which you made unlawful, and some lawful?” Say, “Did God give you permission, or do you fabricate lies and attribute them to God?”"
  10,60,"What will they think—those who fabricate lies and attribute them to God—on the Day of Resurrection? God is bountiful towards the people, but most of them do not give thanks"
  10,61,"You do not get into any situation, nor do you recite any Quran, nor do you do anything, but We are watching over you as you undertake it. Not even the weight of an atom, on earth or in the sky, escapes your Lord, nor is there anything smaller or larger, but is in a clear record"
