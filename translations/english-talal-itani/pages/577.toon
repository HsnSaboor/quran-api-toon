quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,But the intercession of intercessors will not help them
  74,49,Why are they turning away from the Reminder
  74,50,As though they were panicked donkeys
  74,51,Fleeing from a lion
  74,52,Yet every one of them desires to be given scrolls unrolled
  74,53,No indeed! But they do not fear the Hereafter
  74,54,"Nevertheless, it is a reminder"
  74,55,"So whoever wills, shall remember it"
  74,56,"But they will not remember, unless God wills. He is the Source of Righteousness, and the Source of Forgiveness"
  75,1,I swear by the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,And I swear by the blaming soul
  75,3,Does man think that We will not reassemble his bones
  75,4,Yes indeed; We are Able to reconstruct his fingertips
  75,5,But man wants to deny what is ahead of him
  75,6,"He asks, “When is the Day of Resurrection?”"
  75,7,When vision is dazzled
  75,8,And the moon is eclipsed
  75,9,And the sun and the moon are joined together
  75,10,"On that Day, man will say, “Where is the escape?”"
  75,11,No indeed! There is no refuge
  75,12,To your Lord on that Day is the settlement
  75,13,"On that Day man will be informed of everything he put forward, and everything he left behind"
  75,14,And man will be evidence against himself
  75,15,Even as he presents his excuses
  75,16,"Do not wag your tongue with it, to hurry on with it"
  75,17,Upon Us is its collection and its recitation
  75,18,"Then, when We have recited it, follow its recitation"
  75,19,Then upon Us is its explanation
