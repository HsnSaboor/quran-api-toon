quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  44,1,"Ha, Meem"
  44,2,By the Enlightening Scripture
  44,3,We have revealed it on a Blessed Night—We have warned
  44,4,In it is distinguished every wise command
  44,5,A decree from Us. We have been sending messages
  44,6,"As mercy from your Lord. He is the Hearer, the Knower"
  44,7,"Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, if you know for sure"
  44,8,There is no god but He. He gives life and causes death—your Lord and Lord of your ancestors of old
  44,9,Yet they play around in doubt
  44,10,So watch out for the Day when the sky produces a visible smoke
  44,11,Enveloping mankind; this is a painful punishment
  44,12,"“Our Lord, lift the torment from us, we are believers.”"
  44,13,But how can they be reminded? An enlightening messenger has already come to them
  44,14,"But they turned away from him, and said, “Educated, but crazy!”"
  44,15,"We will ease the punishment a little, but you will revert"
  44,16,The Day when We launch the Great Assault—We will avenge
  44,17,Before them We tested the people of Pharaoh; a noble messenger came to them
  44,18,"Saying, “Hand over God’s servants to me. I am an honest messenger to you.”"
