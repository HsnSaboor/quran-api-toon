quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,80,Whoever obeys the Messenger is obeying God. And whoever turns away—We did not send you as a watcher over them
  4,81,"They profess obedience, but when they leave your presence, some of them conspire something contrary to what you said. But God writes down what they conspire. So avoid them, and put your trust in God. God is Guardian enough"
  4,82,"Do they not ponder the Quran? Had it been from any other than God, they would have found in it much discrepancy"
  4,83,"When some news of security or alarm comes their way, they broadcast it. But had they referred it to the Messenger, and to those in authority among them, those who can draw conclusions from it would have comprehended it. Were it not for God’s blessing and mercy upon you, you would have followed the Devil, except for a few"
  4,84,"So fight in the cause of God; you are responsible only for yourself. And rouse the believers. Perhaps God will restrain the might of those who disbelieve. God is Stronger in Might, and More Punishing"
  4,85,"Whoever intercedes for a good cause has a share in it, and whoever intercedes for an evil cause shares in its burdens. God keeps watch over everything"
  4,86,"When you are greeted with a greeting, respond with a better greeting, or return it. God keeps count of everything"
