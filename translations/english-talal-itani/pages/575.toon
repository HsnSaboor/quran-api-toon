quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Your Lord knows that you stay up nearly two-thirds of the night, or half of it, or one-third of it, along with a group of those with you. God designed the night and the day. He knows that you are unable to sustain it, so He has pardoned you. So read of the Quran what is possible for you. He knows that some of you may be ill; and others travelling through the land, seeking God’s bounty; and others fighting in God’s cause. So read of it what is possible for you, and observe the prayers, and give regular charity, and lend God a generous loan. Whatever good you advance for yourselves, you will find it with God, better and generously rewarded. And seek God’s forgiveness, for God is Forgiving and Merciful"
  74,1,O you Enrobed one
  74,2,Arise and warn
  74,3,And magnify your Lord
  74,4,And purify your clothes
  74,5,And abandon abominations
  74,6,And show no favor seeking gain
  74,7,And be constant for your Lord
  74,8,When the Trumpet is blown
  74,9,That Day will be a difficult day
  74,10,For the disbelievers—not easy
  74,11,Leave Me to him whom I created alone
  74,12,And gave him vast wealth
  74,13,And children as witnesses
  74,14,And smoothed things for him
  74,15,Then he wants Me to add yet more
  74,16,By no means! He was stubborn towards Our revelations
  74,17,I will exhaust him increasingly
