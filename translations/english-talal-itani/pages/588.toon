quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,Not at all. The record of the wicked is in Sijjeen
  83,8,But how can you know what Sijjeen is
  83,9,A numerical book
  83,10,Woe on that Day to the deniers
  83,11,Those who deny the Day of Reckoning
  83,12,But none denies it except the sinful aggressor
  83,13,"When Our revelations are recited to him, he says, “Legends of the ancients.”"
  83,14,Not at all. Their hearts have become corroded by what they used to earn
  83,15,"Not at all. On that Day, they will be screened from their Lord"
  83,16,Then they will roast in Hell
  83,17,"Then it will be said, “This is what you used to deny.”"
  83,18,No indeed; the record of the righteous is in Elliyyeen
  83,19,But how can you know what Elliyyoon is
  83,20,A numerical book
  83,21,Witnessed by those brought near
  83,22,"Indeed, the righteous will be amid bliss"
  83,23,"On thrones, looking on"
  83,24,You will recognize on their faces the radiance of bliss
  83,25,They will be given to drink a sealed wine
  83,26,Whose seal is musk—this is what competitors should compete for
  83,27,Its mixture is of Tasneem
  83,28,A spring from which those brought near drink
  83,29,Those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed
  83,30,"And when they passed by them, they would wink at one another"
  83,31,"And when they went back to their families, they would go back exulting"
  83,32,"And if they saw them, they would say, “These people are lost.”"
  83,33,Yet they were not sent as guardians over them
  83,34,"But on that Day, those who believed will laugh at the unbelievers"
