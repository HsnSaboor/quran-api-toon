quran[9]{c,v,t}:

  10,102,"Do they expect anything but the likes of the days of those who passed away before them? Say, “Then wait, I will be waiting with you.”"

  10,104,"Say, “O people, if you are in doubt about my religion—I do not serve those you serve apart from God. But I serve God, the one who will terminate your lives. And I was commanded to be of the believers.”"
