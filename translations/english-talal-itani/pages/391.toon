quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,44,"You were not on the Western Side when We decreed the command to Moses, nor were you among the witnesses"
  28,45,"But We established many generations, and time took its toll on them. Nor were you among the people of Median, reciting Our revelations to them. But We kept sending messengers"
  28,46,"Nor were you by the side of the Mount when We proclaimed. Rather, it was a mercy from your Lord, that you may warn people who received no warner before you, so that they may take heed"
  28,47,"Otherwise, if a calamity befell them as a result of what their hands have perpetrated, they would say, “Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your revelations, and been among the believers.”"
  28,48,"But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “If only he was given the like of what was given to Moses.” Did they not disbelieve in what was given to Moses in the past? They said, “Two works of magic backing one another.” And they said, “We are disbelieving in both.”"
  28,49,"Say, “Then bring a scripture from God, more conductive to guidance than both, and I will follow it, if you are truthful.”"
  28,50,"But if they fail to respond to you, know that they follow their fancies. And who is more lost than him who follows his fancy without guidance from God? God does not guide the unjust people"
