  34,40,"On the Day when He gathers them all together, then say to the angels, “Was it you these used to worship?”"
  34,41,"They will say, “Be You glorified; You are our Master, not them. In fact, they used to worship the jinn, and most of them had faith in them.”"
  34,42,"“Today, none of you has the power to profit or harm the other.” And We will say to those who did wrong, “Taste the agony of the Fire which you used to deny.”"
  34,43,"And when Our enlightening Verses are recited to them, they say, “This is nothing but a man who wants to divert you from what your ancestors used to worship.” And they say, “This is nothing but a fabricated lie.” And when the Truth comes to them, the blasphemers say of the Truth, “This is nothing but plain magic.”"
  34,44,"But We gave them no book to study, and We did not send them any warner before you"
  34,45,"Those before them also denied the Truth, yet they have not attained one-tenth of what We had given them. They rejected My messengers, so how was My disapproval"
  34,46,"Say, “I offer you a single advice: devote yourselves to God, in pairs, or individually; and reflect. There is no madness in your friend. He is just a warner to you, before the advent of a severe punishment.”"
  34,47,"Say, “Whatever compensation I have asked of you, is yours. My compensation comes only from God, and He is Witness over all things.”"
  34,48,"Say, “My Lord projects the truth. He is the Knower of the Unseen.”"
