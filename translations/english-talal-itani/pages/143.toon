quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,119,"And why should you not eat of that over which the Name of God is pronounced, when He has detailed for you what is prohibited for you, unless you are compelled by necessity? Many lead astray with their opinions, through lack of knowledge. Your Lord knows best the transgressors"
  6,120,"So abandon sin, outward and inward. Those who commit sins will be repaid for what they used to perpetrate"
  6,121,"And do not eat from that over which the Name of God was not pronounced, for it is abomination. The devils inspire their followers to argue with you; but if you obey them, you would be polytheists"
  6,122,"Is he who was dead, then We gave him life, and made for him a light by which he walks among the people, like he who is in total darkness, and cannot get out of it? Thus the doings of disbelievers are made to appear good to them"
  6,123,"And thus We set up in every city its leading wicked sinners, to conspire in it, but they conspire only against themselves, and they do not realize it"
  6,124,"When a sign comes to them, they say, “We will not believe unless we are given the like of what was given to God’s messengers.” God knows best where to place His message. Humiliation from God and severe torment will afflict the criminals for their scheming"
