quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,And give me a reputation of truth among the others
  26,85,And make me of the inheritors of the Garden of Bliss
  26,86,And forgive my father—he was one of the misguided
  26,87,And do not disgrace me on the Day they are resurrected
  26,88,The Day when neither wealth nor children will help
  26,89,Except for him who comes to God with a sound heart.”
  26,90,And Paradise will be brought near for the righteous
  26,91,And the Blaze will be displayed to the deviators
  26,92,"And it will be said to them, “Where are those you used to worship?”"
  26,93,"Besides God? Can they help you, or help themselves?”"
  26,94,"Then they will be toppled into it, together with the seducers"
  26,95,"And the soldiers of Satan, all of them"
  26,96,"They will say, as they feud in it"
  26,97,"“By God, We were in evident error"
  26,98,For equating you with the Lord of the Worlds
  26,99,No one misled us except the sinners
  26,100,Now we have no intercessors
  26,101,And no sincere friend
  26,102,"If only we could have another chance, we would be among the faithful.”"
  26,103,"Surely in this is a sign, but most of them are not believers"
  26,104,"Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful"
  26,105,The people of Noah disbelieved the messengers
  26,106,"Their brother Noah said to them, “Do you not fear"
  26,107,I am to you a faithful messenger
  26,108,"So fear God, and obey me"
  26,109,I ask of you no payment for this. My payment is only from the Lord of the Worlds
  26,110,"So fear God, and obey me.”"
  26,111,"They said, “Shall we believe in you, when it is the lowliest who follow you?”"
