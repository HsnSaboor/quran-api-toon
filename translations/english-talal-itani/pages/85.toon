quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,38,"And those who spend their money to be seen by people, and believe neither in God nor in the Last Day. Whoever has Satan as a companion—what an evil companion"
  4,39,"What would they have lost, had they believed in God and the Last Day, and gave out of what God has provided for them? God knows them very well"
  4,40,"God does not commit an atom's weight of injustice; and if there is a good deed, He doubles it, and gives from His Presence a sublime compensation"
  4,41,"Then how will it be, when We bring a witness from every community, and We bring you as a witness against these"
  4,42,"On that Day, those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth were leveled over them. They will conceal nothing from God"
  4,43,"O you who believe! Do not approach the prayer while you are drunk, so that you know what you say; nor after sexual orgasm—unless you are travelling—until you have bathed. If you are sick, or traveling, or one of you comes from the toilet, or you have had intercourse with women, and cannot find water, find clean sand and wipe your faces and your hands with it. God is Pardoning and Forgiving"
  4,44,"Have you not considered those who were given a share of the Book? They buy error, and wish you would lose the way"
