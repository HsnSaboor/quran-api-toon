  3,174,"So they came back with grace from God, and bounty, and no harm having touched them. They pursued what pleases God. God possesses immense grace"
  3,175,"That is only Satan frightening his partisans; so do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are believers"
  3,176,And do not be saddened by those who rush into disbelief. They will not harm God in the least. God desires to give them no share in the Hereafter. A terrible torment awaits them
  3,177,Those who exchange blasphemy for faith will not harm God in the least. A painful torment awaits them
  3,178,"Those who disbelieve should not assume that We respite them for their own good. In fact, We only respite them so that they may increase in sinfulness. A humiliating torment awaits them"
  3,179,"God will not leave the believers as you are, without distinguishing the wicked from the sincere. Nor will God inform you of the future, but God elects from among His messengers whom He wills. So believe in God and His messengers. If you believe and practice piety, you will have a splendid reward"
  3,180,"Those who withhold what God has given them of his bounty should not assume that is good for them. In fact, it is bad for them. They will be encircled by their hoardings on the Day of Resurrection. To God belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth, and God is well acquainted with what you do"
