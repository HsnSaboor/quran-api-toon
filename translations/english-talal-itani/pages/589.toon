quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,"On luxurious furnishings, looking on"
  83,36,Have the unbelievers been repaid for what they used to do
  84,1,When the sky is ruptured
  84,2,"And hearkens to its Lord, as it must"
  84,3,And when the earth is leveled out
  84,4,"And casts out what is in it, and becomes empty"
  84,5,"And hearkens to its Lord, as it must"
  84,6,"O man! You are laboring towards your Lord, and you will meet Him"
  84,7,As for him who is given his book in his right hand
  84,8,He will have an easy settlement
  84,9,And will return to his family delighted
  84,10,But as for him who is given his book behind his back
  84,11,He will call for death
  84,12,And will enter the Blaze
  84,13,He used to be happy among his family
  84,14,He thought he would never return
  84,15,"In fact, his Lord was watching him"
  84,16,I swear by the twilight
  84,17,"And by the night, and what it covers"
  84,18,"And by the moon, as it grows full"
  84,19,You will mount stage by stage
  84,20,What is the matter with them that they do not believe
  84,21,"And when the Quran is read to them, they do not bow down"
  84,22,"In fact, those who disbelieve are in denial"
  84,23,But God knows what they hide inside
  84,24,So inform them of a painful punishment
  84,25,Except those who believe and do good deeds; they will have an undiminished reward
