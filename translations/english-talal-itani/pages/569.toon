quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,They will be shown each other. The criminal wishes he would be redeemed from the punishment of that Day by his children
  70,12,"And his spouse, and his brother"
  70,13,And his family that sheltered him
  70,14,"And everyone on earth, in order to save him"
  70,15,By no means! It is a Raging Fire
  70,16,It strips away the scalps
  70,17,It invites him who once turned his back and fled
  70,18,And accumulated and hoarded
  70,19,Man was created restless
  70,20,"Touched by adversity, he is fretful"
  70,21,"Touched by good, he is ungenerous"
  70,22,Except the prayerful
  70,23,Those who are constant at their prayers
  70,24,And those in whose wealth is a rightful share
  70,25,For the beggar and the deprived
  70,26,And those who affirm the Day of Judgment
  70,27,And those who fear the punishment of their Lord
  70,28,Their Lord’s punishment is not to be taken for granted
  70,29,And those who guard their chastity
  70,30,"Except from their spouses or those living under their control, for then they are free of blame"
  70,31,But whoever seeks to go beyond that—these are the transgressors
  70,32,And those who honor their trusts and their pledges
  70,33,And those who stand by their testimonies
  70,34,And those who are dedicated to their prayers
  70,35,These will be honored in Gardens
  70,36,"What is with those who disbelieve, stretching their necks towards you"
  70,37,"From the right, and from the left, banding together"
  70,38,Is every one of them aspiring to be admitted into a Garden of Bliss
  70,39,No indeed! We created them from what they know
