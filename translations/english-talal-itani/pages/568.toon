quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,So he has no friend here today
  69,36,And no food except scum
  69,37,Which only the sinners eat.”
  69,38,"Indeed, I swear by what you see"
  69,39,And by what you do not see
  69,40,It is the speech of a noble messenger
  69,41,And it is not the speech of a poet—little do you believe
  69,42,Nor is it the speech of a soothsayer—little do you take heed
  69,43,It is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds
  69,44,Had he falsely attributed some statements to Us
  69,45,We would have seized him by the right arm
  69,46,Then slashed his lifeline
  69,47,And none of you could have restrained Us from him
  69,48,"Surely, it is a message for the righteous"
  69,49,And We know that some of you will reject it
  69,50,And it is surely a source of grief for the unbelievers
  69,51,Yet it is the absolute truth
  69,52,"So glorify the name of your Lord, the Magnificent"
  70,1,A questioner questioned the imminent torment
  70,2,For the disbelievers; none can repel it
  70,3,"From God, Lord of the Ways of Ascent"
  70,4,Unto Him the angels and the Spirit ascend on a Day the duration of which is fifty thousand years
  70,5,"So be patient, with sweet patience"
  70,6,They see it distant
  70,7,But We see it near
  70,8,On the Day when the sky will be like molten brass
  70,9,And the mountains will be like tufted wool
  70,10,No friend will care about his friend
