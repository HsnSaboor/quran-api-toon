quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  36,13,And cite for them the parable of the landlords of the town—when the messengers came to it
  36,14,"We sent them two messengers, but they denied them both, so We reinforced them with a third. They said, “We are messengers to you.”"
  36,15,"They said, “You are nothing but humans like us, and the Gracious did not send down anything; you are only lying.”"
  36,16,"They said, “Our Lord knows that we are messengers to you"
  36,17,And our only duty is clear communication.”
  36,18,"They said, “We see an evil omen in you; if you do not give up, we will stone you, and a painful punishment from us will befall you.”"
  36,19,"They said, “Your evil omen is upon you. Is it because you were reminded? But you are an extravagant people.”"
  36,20,"Then a man came running from the remotest part of the city. He said, “O my people, follow the messengers"
  36,21,"Follow those who ask you of no wage, and are themselves guided"
  36,22,"“And why should I not worship Him Who created me, and to Whom you will be returned"
  36,23,"Shall I take other gods instead of Him? If the Merciful desires harm for me, their intercession will not avail me at all, nor will they save me"
  36,24,"In that case, I would be completely lost"
  36,25,"I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me.”"
  36,26,"It was said, “Enter Paradise.” He said, “If only my people knew"
  36,27,"How my Lord has forgiven me, and made me one of the honored.”"
