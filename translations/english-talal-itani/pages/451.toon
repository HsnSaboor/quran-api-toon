  37,127,"But they called him a liar, and thus they will be brought forward"
  37,128,Except for God’s sincere servants
  37,129,And We left with him for later generations
  37,130,Peace be upon the House of Elijah
  37,131,Thus We reward the virtuous
  37,132,He was one of Our believing servants
  37,133,And Lot was one of the messengers
  37,134,"We saved him and his family, all of them"
  37,135,Except for an old woman who lagged behind
  37,136,Then We annihilated the others
