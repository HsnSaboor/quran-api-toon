quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,"And how could you disbelieve, when God’s revelations are being recited to you, and among you is His Messenger? Whoever cleaves to God has been guided to a straight path"
  3,102,"O you who believe! Revere God with due reverence, and do not die except as Muslims"
  3,103,"And hold fast to the rope of God, altogether, and do not become divided. And remember God’s blessings upon you; how you were enemies, and He reconciled your hearts, and by His grace you became brethren. And you were on the brink of a pit of fire, and He saved you from it. God thus clarifies His revelations for you, so that you may be guided"
  3,104,"And let there be among you a community calling to virtue, and advocating righteousness, and deterring from evil. These are the successful"
  3,105,And do not be like those who separated and disputed after the clear proofs came to them; for them is a great punishment
  3,106,"On the Day when some faces will be whitened, and some faces will be blackened. As for those whose faces are blackened: “Did you disbelieve after your belief?” Then taste the punishment for having disbelieved"
  3,107,"But as for those whose faces are whitened: they are in God’s mercy, remaining in it forever"
  3,108,These are the revelations of God. We recite them to you in truth. God desires no injustice for mankind
