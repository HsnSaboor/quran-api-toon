quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"Their likeness is that of a person who kindled a fire; when it illuminated all around him, God took away their light, and left them in darkness, unable to see"
  2,18,"Deaf, dumb, blind. They will not return"
  2,19,"Or like a cloudburst from the sky, in which is darkness, and thunder, and lightning. They press their fingers into their ears from the thunderbolts, in fear of death. But God surrounds the disbelievers"
  2,20,"The lightning almost snatches their sight away. Whenever it illuminates for them, they walk in it; but when it grows dark over them, they stand still. Had God willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. God is capable of everything"
  2,21,"O people! Worship your Lord who created you and those before you, that you may attain piety"
  2,22,"He who made the earth a habitat for you, and the sky a structure, and sends water down from the sky, and brings out fruits thereby, as a sustenance for you. Therefore, do not assign rivals to God while you know"
  2,23,"And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a chapter like these, and call your witnesses apart from God, if you are truthful"
  2,24,"But if you do not—and you will not—then beware the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for the disbelievers"
