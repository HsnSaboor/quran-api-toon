quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Say, “What thing is more solemn in testimony?” Say, “God is Witness between you and me. This Quran was revealed to me, that I may warn you with it, and whomever it may reach. Do you indeed testify that there are other gods with God?” Say, “I myself do not testify.” Say, “He is but One God, and I am innocent of your idolatry.”"
  6,20,Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their own children; but those who have lost their souls do not believe
  6,21,"Who does greater wrong than someone who fabricates lies against God, or denies His revelations? The wrongdoers will not succeed"
  6,22,"On the Day when We gather them all together, then say to the idolaters, “Where are your idols, those you used to claim?”"
  6,23,"Then their only argument will be to say, “By God, our Lord, we were not idolaters.”"
  6,24,Look how they lied to themselves. And what they invented deserted them
  6,25,"Among them are those who listen to you; but We place covers over their hearts, to prevent them from understanding it, and heaviness in their ears. Even if they see every sign, they will not believe in it. Until, when they come to you, to argue with you, those who disbelieve will say, “These are nothing but myths of the ancients.”"
  6,26,"They keep others from it, and avoid it themselves; but they ruin only their own souls, and they do not realize"
  6,27,"If only you could see, when they are made to stand before the Fire; they will say, “If only we could be sent back, and not reject the revelations of our Lord, and be among the faithful.”"
