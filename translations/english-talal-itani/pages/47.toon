quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"Those who swallow usury will not rise, except as someone driven mad by Satan's touch. That is because they say, “Commerce is like usury.” But God has permitted commerce, and has forbidden usury. Whoever, on receiving advice from his Lord, refrains, may keep his past earnings, and his case rests with God. But whoever resumes—these are the dwellers of the Fire, wherein they will abide forever"
  2,276,"God condemns usury, and He blesses charities. God does not love any sinful ingrate"
  2,277,"Those who believe, and do good deeds, and pray regularly, and give charity—they will have their reward with their Lord; they will have no fear, nor shall they grieve"
  2,278,"O you who believe! Fear God, and forgo what remains of usury, if you are believers"
  2,279,"If you do not, then take notice of a war by God and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may keep your capital, neither wronging, nor being wronged"
  2,280,"But if he is in hardship, then deferment until a time of ease. But to remit it as charity is better for you, if you only knew"
  2,281,"And guard yourselves against a Day when you will be returned to God; then each soul will be rewarded fully for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged"
