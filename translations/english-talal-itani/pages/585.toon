quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and turned away
  80,2,When the blind man approached him
  80,3,But how do you know? Perhaps he was seeking to purify himself
  80,4,"Or be reminded, and the message would benefit him"
  80,5,But as for him who was indifferent
  80,6,You gave him your attention
  80,7,Though you are not liable if he does not purify himself
  80,8,But as for him who came to you seeking
  80,9,In awe
  80,10,To him you were inattentive
  80,11,Do not. This is a Lesson
  80,12,"Whoever wills, shall remember it"
  80,13,On honorable pages
  80,14,Exalted and purified
  80,15,By the hands of scribes
  80,16,Noble and devoted
  80,17,Perish man! How thankless he is
  80,18,From what did He create him
  80,19,"From a sperm drop He created him, and enabled him"
  80,20,Then He eased the way for him
  80,21,"Then He puts him to death, and buries him"
  80,22,"Then, when He wills, He will resurrect him"
  80,23,"But no, he did not fulfill what He has commanded him"
  80,24,Let man consider his food
  80,25,We pour down water in abundance
  80,26,Then crack the soil open
  80,27,And grow in it grains
  80,28,And grapes and herbs
  80,29,And olives and dates
  80,30,And luscious gardens
  80,31,And fruits and vegetables
  80,32,"Enjoyment for you, and for your livestock"
  80,33,But when the Deafening Noise comes to pass
  80,34,The Day when a person will flee from his brother
  80,35,And his mother and his father
  80,36,And his consort and his children
  80,37,"Every one of them, on that Day, will have enough to preoccupy him"
  80,38,Faces on that Day will be radiant
  80,39,Laughing and rejoicing
  80,40,And Faces on that Day will be covered with misery
  80,41,Overwhelmed by remorse
  80,42,"These are the faithless, the vicious"
