quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,But for the righteous there is triumph
  78,32,Gardens and vineyards
  78,33,"And splendid spouses, well matched"
  78,34,And delicious drinks
  78,35,"They will hear therein neither gossip, nor lies"
  78,36,"A reward from your Lord, a fitting gift"
  78,37,"Lord of the heavens and the earth, and everything between them—The Most Merciful—none can argue with Him"
  78,38,"On the Day when the Spirit and the angels stand in row. They will not speak, unless it be one permitted by the Most Merciful, and he will say what is right"
  78,39,"That is the Day of Reality. So whoever wills, let him take a way back to his Lord"
  78,40,"We have warned you of a near punishment—the Day when a person will observe what his hands have produced, and the faithless will say, “O, I wish I were dust.”"
  79,1,By those who snatch violently
  79,2,And those who remove gently
  79,3,And those who glide smoothly
  79,4,And those who race swiftly
  79,5,And those who regulate events
  79,6,On the Day when the Quake quakes
  79,7,And is followed by the Successor
  79,8,Hearts on that Day will be pounding
  79,9,Their sights downcast
  79,10,"They say, “Are we to be restored to the original condition"
  79,11,When we have become hollow bones?”
  79,12,"They say, “This is a losing proposition.”"
  79,13,But it will be only a single nudge
  79,14,And they will be awake
  79,15,Has the story of Moses reached you
