quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and its radiance
  91,2,And the moon as it follows it
  91,3,And the day as it reveals it
  91,4,And the night as it conceals it
  91,5,And the sky and He who built it
  91,6,And the earth and He who spread it
  91,7,And the soul and He who proportioned it
  91,8,And inspired it with its wickedness and its righteousness
  91,9,Successful is he who purifies it
  91,10,Failing is he who corrupts it
  91,11,Thamood denied in its pride
  91,12,When it followed its most wicked
  91,13,"The messenger of God said to them, “This is the she-camel of God, so let her drink.”"
  91,14,"But they called him a liar, and hamstrung her. So their Lord crushed them for their sin, and leveled it"
  91,15,And He does not fear its sequel
  92,1,By the night as it covers
  92,2,And the day as it reveals
  92,3,And He who created the male and the female
  92,4,Your endeavors are indeed diverse
  92,5,As for him who gives and is righteous
  92,6,And confirms goodness
  92,7,We will ease his way towards ease
  92,8,But as for him who is stingy and complacent
  92,9,And denies goodness
  92,10,We will ease his way towards difficulty
  92,11,And his money will not avail him when he plummets
  92,12,It is upon Us to guide
  92,13,And to Us belong the Last and the First
  92,14,I have warned you of a Fierce Blaze
