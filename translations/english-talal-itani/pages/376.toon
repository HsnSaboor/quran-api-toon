quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,Of what avail to them will be their past enjoyments
  26,208,"Never did We destroy a town, but it had warners"
  26,209,As a reminder—We are never unjust
  26,210,It was not the devils that revealed it
  26,211,"It is not in their interests, nor in their power"
  26,212,They are barred from hearing
  26,213,"So do not pray to another god with God, else you will be of those tormented"
  26,214,And warn your close relatives
  26,215,And lower your wing to those of the believers who follow you
  26,216,"And if they disobey you, say, “I am innocent of what you do.”"
  26,217,"And put your trust in the Almighty, the Merciful"
  26,218,He Who sees you when you rise
  26,219,And your devotions amidst the worshipers
  26,220,"He is indeed the Hearer, the Aware"
  26,221,Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend
  26,222,They descend upon every sinful liar
  26,223,"They give ear, and most of them are liars"
  26,224,And as for the poets—the deviators follow them
  26,225,Do you not see how they ramble in every style
  26,226,And how they say what they do not do
  26,227,"Except for those who believe, and do good deeds, and remember God frequently, and defend themselves after they are wronged. As for those who do wrong, they will know by what overturning they will be overturned"
