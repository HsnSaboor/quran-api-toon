quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you? How do you judge
  37,155,Will you not reflect
  37,156,Or do you have some clear proof
  37,157,"Then bring your book, if you are telling the truth"
  37,158,And they invented a relationship between Him and the jinn. But the jinn know that they will be arraigned
  37,159,"God be glorified, far above what they allege"
  37,160,Except for God’s sincere servants
  37,161,"Surely, you and what you serve"
  37,162,Cannot seduce away from Him
  37,163,Except for he who will be roasting in Hell
  37,164,“There is not one of us but has an assigned position
  37,165,And we are the arrangers
  37,166,And we are the glorifiers.”
  37,167,Even though they used to say
  37,168,“Had we received advice from the ancients
  37,169,We would have been God's faithful servants.”
  37,170,"But they rejected it, so they will find out"
  37,171,Our Word has already gone out to our servant messengers
  37,172,It is they who will be supported
  37,173,And Our troops will be the victors
  37,174,So disregard them for a while
  37,175,And watch them—they will soon see
  37,176,Are they seeking to hasten Our punishment
  37,177,"When it descends into their yard, miserable will be the morning of those forewarned"
  37,178,So avoid them for a while
  37,179,And watch—they will soon see
  37,180,"Exalted be your Lord, the Lord of Glory, beyond their allegations"
  37,181,And peace be upon the messengers
  37,182,"And praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds"
