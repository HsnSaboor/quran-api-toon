quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"There is no good in much of their private counsels, except for him who advocates charity, or kindness, or reconciliation between people. Whoever does that, seeking God’s approval, We will give him a great compensation"
  4,115,"Whoever makes a breach with the Messenger, after the guidance has become clear to him, and follows other than the path of the believers, We will direct him in the direction he has chosen, and commit him to Hell—what a terrible destination"
  4,116,"God will not forgive that partners be associated with Him; but will forgive anything less than that, to whomever He wills. Anyone who ascribes partners to God has strayed into far error"
  4,117,"They invoke in His stead only females. In fact, they invoke none but a rebellious devil"
  4,118,"God has cursed him. And he said, “I will take to myself my due share of Your servants.”"
  4,119,"“And I will mislead them, and I will entice them, and I will prompt them to slit the ears of cattle, and I will prompt them to alter the creation of God.” Whoever takes Satan as a lord, instead of God, has surely suffered a profound loss"
  4,120,"He promises them, and he raises their expectations, but Satan promises them nothing but delusions"
  4,121,"These—their place is Hell, and they will find no escape from it"
