quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,"What about someone whose heart God has opened to Islam, so that he follows a light from His Lord? Woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the mention of God. Those are in manifest error"
  39,23,"God has sent down the best of narrations: a Scripture consistent and paired. The skins of those who reverence their Lord shiver from it, then their skins and their hearts soften up to the remembrance of God. Such is God’s guidance; He guides with it whomever He wills. But whomever God leaves astray, for him there is no guide"
  39,24,"What about someone who covers his face against the terrible misery of the Day of Resurrection? To the evildoers it will be said, “Taste what you used to earn.”"
  39,25,"Those before them also denied the truth, so the penalty came upon them from where they did not perceive"
  39,26,"God made them taste disgrace in the present life, but the punishment of the Hereafter is worse, if they only knew"
  39,27,"We have cited in this Quran for mankind every ideal, that they may take heed"
  39,28,"An Arabic Quran, without any defect, so they may become righteous"
  39,29,"God cites the example of a man shared by partners at odds, and a man belonging exclusively to one man. Are they equal in status? Praise be to God, but most of them do not know"
  39,30,"You will die, and they will die"
  39,31,"Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will be quarrelling before your Lord"
