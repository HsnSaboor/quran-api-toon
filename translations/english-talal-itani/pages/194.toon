quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,41,"Mobilize, light or heavy, and strive with your possessions and your lives in the cause of God. That is better for you, if you only knew"
  9,42,"Had the gain been immediate, and the journey shorter, they would have followed you; but the distance seemed too long for them. Still they swear by God: “Had we been able, we would have marched out with you.” They damn their own souls, and God knows that they are lying"
  9,43,"May God pardon you! Why did you give them permission before it became clear to you who are the truthful ones, and who are the liars"
  9,44,Those who believe in God and the Last Day do not ask you for exemption from striving with their possessions and their lives. God is fully aware of the righteous
  9,45,"Only those who do not believe in God and the Last Day ask you for exemption. Their hearts are full of doubts, so they waver in their doubts"
  9,46,"Had they wanted to mobilize, they would have made preparations for it; but God disliked their participation, so he held them back, and it was said, “Stay behind with those who stay behind.”"
  9,47,"Had they mobilized with you, they would have added only to your difficulties, and they would have spread rumors in your midst, trying to sow discord among you. Some of you are avid listeners to them. God is Aware of the wrongdoers"
