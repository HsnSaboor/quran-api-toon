quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"Those who lie in wait for you: if you attain victory from God, they say, “Were we not with you?” But if the disbelievers get a turn, they say, “Did we not side with you, and defend you from the believers?” God will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection; and God will give the disbelievers no means of overcoming the believers"
  4,142,"The hypocrites try to deceive God, but He is deceiving them. And when they stand for prayer, they stand lazily, showing off in front of people, and remembering God only a little"
  4,143,"Wavering in between, neither with these, nor with those. Whomever God sends astray, you will never find for him a way"
  4,144,O you who believe! Do not befriend disbelievers rather than believers. Do you want to give God a clear case against you
  4,145,"The hypocrites will be in the lowest level of the Fire, and you will find no helper for them"
  4,146,"Except those who repent, and reform, and hold fast to God, and dedicate their religion to God alone. These are with the believers; and God will give the believers a great reward"
  4,147,"What would God accomplish by your punishment, if you have given thanks, and have believed? God is Appreciative and Cognizant"
