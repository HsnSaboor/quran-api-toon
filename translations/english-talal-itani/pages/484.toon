  42,15,"To this go on inviting, and be upright as you were commanded, and do not follow their inclinations, and say, “I believe in whatever Book God has sent down, and I was commanded to judge between you equitably. God is our Lord and your Lord. We have our deeds, and you have your deeds. Let there be no quarrel between us and you. God will bring us together, and to Him is the ultimate return.”"
