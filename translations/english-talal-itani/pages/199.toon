quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,73,"O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with them. Their abode is Hell—what a miserable destination"
  9,74,"They swear by God that they said nothing; but they did utter the word of blasphemy, and they renounced faith after their submission. And they plotted what they could not attain. They were resentful only because God and His Messenger have enriched them out of His grace. If they repent, it would be best for them; but if they turn away, God will afflict them with a painful punishment—in this life and in the Hereafter—and they will have on earth no protector and no savior"
  9,75,"Among them are those who promised God: “If He gives us of His bounty, we will donate and be among the upright.”"
  9,76,"But when He has given them of His bounty, they became stingy with it, and turned away in aversion"
  9,77,"So He penalized them with hypocrisy in their hearts, until the Day they face Him—because they broke their promise to God, and because they used to lie"
  9,78,Do they not know that God knows their secrets and their conspiracies? And that God is the Knower of the unseen
  9,79,"Those who criticize the believers who give charity voluntarily, and ridicule those who find nothing to give except their own efforts—God ridicules them. They will have a painful punishment"
