quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,164,"In the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the alternation of night and day; in the ships that sail the oceans for the benefit of mankind; in the water that God sends down from the sky, and revives the earth with it after it had died, and scatters in it all kinds of creatures; in the changing of the winds, and the clouds disposed between the sky and the earth; are signs for people who understand"
  2,165,"Yet among the people are those who take other than God as equals to Him. They love them as the love of God. But those who believe have greater love for God. If only the wrongdoers would realize, when they see the torment; that all power is God’s, and that God is severe in punishment"
  2,166,"Those who were followed will then disown those who followed them, and they will see the retribution, and ties between them will be severed"
  2,167,"Those who followed will say, “If only we can have another chance, we will disown them, as they disowned us.” Thus God will show them their deeds, as regrets to them, and they will not come out of the Fire"
  2,168,"O people! Eat of what is lawful and good on earth, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. He is to you an open enemy"
  2,169,"He commands you to do evil and vice, and to say about God what you do not know"
