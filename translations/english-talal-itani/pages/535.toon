quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,Serving them will be immortalized youth
  56,18,"With cups, pitchers, and sparkling drinks"
  56,19,"Causing them neither headache, nor intoxication"
  56,20,And fruits of their choice
  56,21,And meat of birds that they may desire
  56,22,And lovely companions
  56,23,The likenesses of treasured pearls
  56,24,As a reward for what they used to do
  56,25,"Therein they will hear no nonsense, and no accusations"
  56,26,"But only the greeting: “Peace, peace.”"
  56,27,And those on the Right—what of those on the Right
  56,28,In lush orchards
  56,29,And sweet-smelling plants
  56,30,And extended shade
  56,31,And outpouring water
  56,32,And abundant fruit
  56,33,"Neither withheld, nor forbidden"
  56,34,And uplifted mattresses
  56,35,We have created them of special creation
  56,36,And made them virgins
  56,37,Tender and un-aging
  56,38,For those on the Right
  56,39,A throng from the ancients
  56,40,And a throng from the latecomers
  56,41,And those on the Left—what of those on the Left
  56,42,Amid searing wind and boiling water
  56,43,And a shadow of thick smoke
  56,44,"Neither cool, nor refreshing"
  56,45,They had lived before that in luxury
  56,46,And they used to persist in immense wrongdoing
  56,47,"And they used to say, “When we are dead and turned into dust and bones, are we to be resurrected"
  56,48,And our ancient ancestors too?”
  56,49,"Say, “The first and the last"
  56,50,Will be gathered for the appointment of a familiar Day.”
