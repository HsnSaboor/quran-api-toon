quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,What are they asking one another about
  78,2,About the Great Event
  78,3,About which they disagree
  78,4,"Surely, they will find out"
  78,5,"Most certainly, they will find out"
  78,6,Did We not make the earth a cradle
  78,7,And the mountains pegs
  78,8,And created you in pairs
  78,9,And made your sleep for rest
  78,10,And made the night a cover
  78,11,And made the day for livelihood
  78,12,And built above you seven strong ones
  78,13,And placed a blazing lamp
  78,14,And brought down from the clouds pouring water
  78,15,To produce with it grains and vegetation
  78,16,And luxuriant gardens
  78,17,The Day of Sorting has been appointed
  78,18,"The Day when the Trumpet is blown, and you will come in droves"
  78,19,"And the sky is opened up, and becomes gateways"
  78,20,"And the mountains are set in motion, and become a mirage"
  78,21,Hell is lying in ambush
  78,22,"For the oppressors, a destination"
  78,23,Where they will remain for eons
  78,24,"They will taste therein neither coolness, nor drink"
  78,25,"Except boiling water, and freezing hail"
  78,26,A fitting requital
  78,27,For they were not anticipating any reckoning
  78,28,And they denied Our signs utterly
  78,29,But We have enumerated everything in writing
  78,30,So taste! We will increase you only in suffering
