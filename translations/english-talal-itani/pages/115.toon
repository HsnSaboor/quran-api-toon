  5,42,"Listeners to falsehoods, eaters of illicit earnings. If they come to you, judge between them, or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they will not harm you in the least. But if you judge, judge between them equitably. God loves the equitable"
  5,43,"But why do they come to you for judgment, when they have the Torah, in which is God’s Law? Yet they turn away after that. These are not believers"
  5,44,"We have revealed the Torah, wherein is guidance and light.

  5,45,"And We wrote for them in it: a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and an equal wound for a wound; but whoever forgoes it in charity, it will serve as atonement for him. Those who do not rule according to what God revealed are the evildoers"
