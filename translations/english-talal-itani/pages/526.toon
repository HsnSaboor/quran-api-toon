quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star as it goes down
  53,2,"Your friend has not gone astray, nor has he erred"
  53,3,Nor does he speak out of desire
  53,4,It is but a revelation revealed
  53,5,Taught to him by the Extremely Powerful
  53,6,The one of vigor. He settled
  53,7,While he was at the highest horizon
  53,8,"Then he came near, and hovered around"
  53,9,"He was within two bows’ length, or closer"
  53,10,Then He revealed to His servant what He revealed
  53,11,The heart did not lie about what it saw
  53,12,Will you dispute with him concerning what he saw
  53,13,He saw him on another descent
  53,14,At the Lotus Tree of the Extremity
  53,15,Near which is the Garden of Repose
  53,16,As there covered the Lotus Tree what covered it
  53,17,"The sight did not waver, nor did it exceed"
  53,18,He saw some of the Great Signs of his Lord
  53,19,Have you considered al-Lat and al-Uzza
  53,20,"And Manat, the third one, the other"
  53,21,"Are you to have the males, and He the females"
  53,22,What a bizarre distribution
  53,23,"These are nothing but names, which you have devised, you and your ancestors, for which God sent down no authority. They follow nothing but assumptions, and what the ego desires, even though guidance has come to them from their Lord"
  53,24,Or is the human being to have whatever he desires
  53,25,To God belong the Last and the First
  53,26,"How many an angel is there in the heavens whose intercession avails nothing, except after God gives permission to whomever He wills, and approves"
