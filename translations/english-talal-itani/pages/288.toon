quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,59,"Nothing prevents Us from sending miraculous signs, except that the ancients called them lies. We gave Thamood the she-camel, a visible sign, but they mistreated her. We do not send the signs except to instill reverence"
  17,60,"We said to you that your Lord encompasses humanity. We did not make the vision We showed you, except as a test for the people, and the tree cursed in the Quran. We frighten them, but that only increases their defiance"
  17,61,"When We said to the angels, “Bow down before Adam,” they bowed down, except for Satan. He said, “Shall I bow down before someone You created from mud?”"
  17,62,"He said, “Do You see this one whom You have honored more than me? If You reprieve me until the Day of Resurrection, I will bring his descendants under my sway, except for a few.”"
  17,63,"He said, “Begone! Whoever of them follows you—Hell is your reward, an ample reward.”"
  17,64,"“And entice whomever of them you can with your voice, and rally against them your cavalry and your infantry, and share with them in wealth and children, and make promises to them.” But Satan promises them nothing but delusion"
  17,65,"“As for My devotees, you have no authority over them.” Your Lord is an adequate Guardian"
  17,66,"Your Lord is He who propels for you the ships at sea, that you may seek of His bounty. He is towards you Most Merciful"
