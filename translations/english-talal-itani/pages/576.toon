quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,He thought and analyzed
  74,19,"May he perish, how he analyzed"
  74,20,"Again: may he perish, how he analyzed"
  74,21,Then he looked
  74,22,Then he frowned and whined
  74,23,Then he turned back and was proud
  74,24,"And said, “This is nothing but magic from the past"
  74,25,This is nothing but the word of a mortal.”
  74,26,I will roast him in Saqar
  74,27,But what will explain to you what Saqar is
  74,28,"It neither leaves, nor spares"

  74,31,"We have appointed only angels to be wardens of the Fire, and caused their number to be a stumbling block for those who disbelieve; so that those given the Scripture may attain certainty; and those who believe may increase in faith; and those given the Scripture and the believers may not doubt; and those in whose hearts is sickness and the unbelievers may say, “What did God intend by this parable?” Thus God leads astray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills. None knows the soldiers of your Lord except He. This is nothing but a reminder for the mortals"

  74,33,And the night as it retreats

  74,47,Until the Inevitable came upon us.”
