quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  55,68,"In them are fruits, and date-palms, and pomegranates"
  55,69,So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny
  55,70,In them are good and beautiful ones
  55,71,So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny
  55,72,"Companions, secluded in the tents"
  55,73,So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny
  55,74,"Whom no human has touched before, nor jinn"
  55,75,So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny
  55,76,"Reclining on green cushions, and exquisite carpets"
  55,77,So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny
  55,78,"Blessed be the name of your Lord, Full of Majesty and Splendor"
  56,1,When the inevitable occurs
  56,2,"Of its occurrence, there is no denial"
  56,3,"Bringing low, raising high"
  56,4,When the earth is shaken with a shock
  56,5,And the mountains are crushed and crumbled
  56,6,And they become scattered dust
  56,7,And you become three classes
  56,8,Those on the Right—what of those on the Right
  56,9,And those on the Left—what of those on the Left
  56,10,"And the forerunners, the forerunners"
  56,11,Those are the nearest
  56,12,In the Gardens of Bliss
  56,13,A throng from the ancients
  56,14,And a small band from the latecomers
  56,15,On luxurious furnishings
  56,16,"Reclining on them, facing one another"
