quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,When His Lord called out to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa
  79,17,“Go to Pharaoh—he has transgressed.”
  79,18,"And say, “Do you care to be cleansed"
  79,19,"And I will guide you to your Lord, and you will turn reverent.”"
  79,20,He showed him the Greatest Miracle
  79,21,But he denied and defied
  79,22,"Then turned his back, and tried"
  79,23,And gathered and proclaimed
  79,24,"He said, “I am your Lord, the most high.”"
  79,25,"So God seized him with an exemplary punishment, in the last and in the first"
  79,26,In this is a lesson for whoever fears
  79,27,"Are you more difficult to create, or the heaven? He constructed it"
  79,28,"He raised its masses, and proportioned it"
  79,29,"And He dimmed its night, and brought out its daylight"
  79,30,And the earth after that He spread
  79,31,"And from it, He produced its water and its pasture"
  79,32,"And the mountains, He anchored"
  79,33,A source of enjoyment for you and for your animals
  79,34,But when the Great Cataclysm arrives
  79,35,A Day when man will remember what he has endeavored
  79,36,And Hell will be displayed to whoever sees
  79,37,As for him who was defiant
  79,38,And preferred the life of this world
  79,39,Then Hell is the shelter
  79,40,"But as for him who feared the Standing of his Lord, and restrained the self from desires"
  79,41,Then Paradise is the shelter
  79,42,"They ask you about the Hour, “When will it take place?”"
  79,43,You have no knowledge of it
  79,44,To your Lord is its finality
  79,45,You are just a warner for whoever dreads it
  79,46,"On the Day when they witness it—as though they only stayed an evening, or its morning"
