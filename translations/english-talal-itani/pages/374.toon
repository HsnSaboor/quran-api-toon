  26,160,The people of Lot disbelieved the messengers
  26,161,"When their brother Lot said to them, “Do you not fear"
  26,162,I am to you a faithful messenger
  26,163,"So fear God, and obey me"
  26,164,I ask of you no payment for it. My payment is only from the Lord of the Worlds
  26,165,Do you approach the males of the world
  26,166,"And forsake the wives your Lord created for you? Indeed, you are intrusive people.”"
  26,167,"They said, “Unless you refrain, O Lot, you will be expelled.”"
  26,168,"He said, “I certainly deplore your conduct.”"

  26,170,"So We saved him and his family, altogether"
  26,171,Except for an old woman among those who tarried
  26,172,Then We destroyed the others
  26,173,And We rained down on them a rain. Dreadful is the rain of those forewarned
  26,174,"Surely in this is a sign, but most of them are not believers"
  26,175,"Your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful"

  26,179,"So fear God, and obey me"
