  19,77,"Have you seen him who denied Our revelations, and said, “I will be given wealth and children”"
  19,78,"Did he look into the future, or did he receive a promise from the Most Merciful"
  19,79,"No indeed! We will write what he says, and will keep extending the agony for him"
  19,80,"Then We will inherit from him what he speaks of, and he will come to Us alone"
  19,81,"And they took, besides God, other gods, to be for them a source of strength"
  19,82,"By no means! They will reject their worship of them, and become opponents to them"
  19,83,"Have you not considered how We dispatch the devils against the disbelievers, exciting them with incitement"

  19,90,"At which the heavens almost rupture, and the earth splits, and the mountains fall and crumble"
  19,91,Because they attribute a son to the Most Merciful

  19,93,There is none in the heavens and the earth but will come to the Most Merciful as a servant
  19,94,"He has enumerated them, and counted them one by one"
  19,95,And each one of them will come to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone
