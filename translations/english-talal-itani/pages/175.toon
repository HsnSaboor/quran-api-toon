quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"Say, “I have no control over any benefit or harm to myself, except as God wills. Had I known the future, I would have acquired much good, and no harm would have touched me. I am only a warner, and a herald of good news to a people who believe.”"
  7,189,"It is He who created you from a single person, and made from it its mate, that he may find comfort with her. Then, when he has covered her, she conceives a light load, and she carries it around. But when she has grown heavy, they pray to God their Lord, “if You give us a good child, we will be among the thankful.”"
  7,190,"But when He has given them a good child, they attribute partners to Him in what He has given them. God is exalted above what they associate"
  7,191,"Do they idolize those who create nothing, and are themselves created"
  7,192,"And can neither help them, nor help their own selves"
  7,193,"And if you invite them to guidance, they will not follow you. It is the same for you, whether you invite them, or remain silent"
  7,194,"Those you call upon besides God are servants like you. So call upon them, and let them answer you, if you are truthful"
  7,195,"Do they have feet with which they walk? Or do they have hands with which they strike? Or do they have eyes with which they see? Or do they have ears with which they hear? Say, “Call upon your partners, then plot against me, and do not wait.”"
