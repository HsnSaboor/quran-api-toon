  42,32,And of His signs are the ships sailing the sea like flags
  42,33,"If He willed, He could have stilled the winds, leaving them motionless on its surface. Surely in that are signs for every disciplined, grateful person"
  42,34,"Or He could wreck them, because of what they have earned. And yet He pardons much"
  42,35,Those who dispute Our signs know that there is no asylum for them
  42,36,Whatever thing you are given is only the provision of this life. But what God possesses is better and more lasting for those who believe and rely on their Lord
  42,37,"And those who avoid major sins and indecencies; and if they become angry, they forgive"
  42,38,"And those who respond to their Lord, and pray regularly, and conduct their affairs by mutual consultation, and give of what We have provided them"
  42,39,"And those who, when wronged, defend themselves"

  42,44,"Whoever God leaves astray has no protector apart from Him. And you will see the transgressors, when they see the torment, saying, “Is there a way of going back?”"
