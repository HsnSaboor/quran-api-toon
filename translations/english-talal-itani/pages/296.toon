  18,21,"So it was, that We caused them to be discovered, that they would know that the promise of God is true, and that of the Hour there is no doubt. As they were disputing their case among themselves, they said, “Build over them a building.” Their Lord knows best about them. Those who prevailed over their case said, “We will set up over them a place of worship.”"
  18,22,"They will say, “Three, and their fourth being their dog.” And they will say, “Five, and their sixth being their dog,” guessing at the unknown. And they will say, “Seven, and their eighth being their dog.” Say, “My Lord knows best their number.” None knows them except a few. So do not argue concerning them except with an obvious argument, and do not consult any of them about them"
  18,23,"And never say about anything, “I will do that tomorrow.”"
  18,24,"Without saying, “If God wills.” And remember your Lord if you forget, and say, “Perhaps my Lord will guide me to nearer than this in integrity.”"
  18,25,"And they stayed in their cave for three hundred years, adding nine"

  18,27,"And recite what was revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. There is no changing His words, and you will find no refuge except in Him"
