  37,77,And We made his descendants the survivors
  37,78,And We left mention of him among those who succeeded
  37,79,Peace be upon Noah among all people
  37,80,We thus reward the righteous
  37,81,He was one of Our believing servants
  37,82,Then We drowned the others
  37,83,Of his kind was Abraham
  37,84,When he came to his Lord with a sound heart
  37,85,"He said to his father and his people, “What are you worshiping"
  37,86,"Is it falsified gods, instead of God, that you want"
  37,87,So what is your opinion about the Lord of the Worlds?”
  37,88,Then he took a glance at the stars
  37,89,"And said, “I am sick.”"
  37,90,"But they turned their backs on him, and went away"
  37,91,"Then he turned to their gods, and said, “will you not eat"
  37,92,"What is it with you, that you do not speak?”"
  37,93,"Then he turned on them, striking with his right hand"
  37,94,And they came running towards him
  37,95,"He said, “Do you worship what you carve"
  37,96,"When God created you, and what you manufacture?”"
  37,97,"They said, “Build a pyre for him, and throw him into the furnace.”"
  37,98,"They wished him ill, but We made them the losers"
  37,99,"He said, “I am going towards my Lord, and He will guide me.”"
  37,100,"“My Lord, give me one of the righteous.”"
  37,101,So We gave him good news of a clement boy
  37,102,"Then, when he was old enough to accompany him, he said, “O My son, I see in a dream that I am sacrificing you; see what you think.” He said, “O my Father, do as you are commanded; you will find me, God willing, one of the steadfast.”"
