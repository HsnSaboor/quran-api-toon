quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,And the contents of the hearts are obtained
  100,11,"Their Lord, on that Day, is fully informed of them"
  101,1,The Shocker
  101,2,What is the Shocker
  101,3,What will explain to you what the Shocker is
  101,4,The Day when the people will be like scattered moths
  101,5,And the mountains will be like tufted wool
  101,6,As for he whose scales are heavy
  101,7,He will be in a pleasant life
  101,8,But as for he whose scales are light
  101,9,His home is the Abyss
  101,10,Do you know what it is
  101,11,A Raging Fire
  102,1,Abundance distracts you
  102,2,Until you visit the graveyards
  102,3,"Indeed, you will know"
  102,4,"Certainly, you will know"
  102,5,If you knew with knowledge of certainty
  102,6,You would see the Inferno
  102,7,Then you will see it with the eye of certainty
  102,8,"Then, on that Day, you will be questioned about the Bliss"
