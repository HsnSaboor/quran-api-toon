  20,65,"They said, “O Moses, either you throw, or we will be the first to throw.”"
  20,66,"He said, “You throw.” And suddenly, their ropes and sticks appeared to him, because of their magic, to be crawling swiftly"
  20,67,So Moses felt apprehensive within himself
  20,68,"We said, “Do not be afraid, you are the uppermost"
  20,69,"Now throw down what is in your right hand—it will swallow what they have crafted. What they have crafted is only a magician’s trickery. But the magician will not succeed, no matter what he does.”"
  20,70,"And the magicians fell down prostrate. They said, “We have believed in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.”"
  20,71,"He said, “Did you believe in him before I have given you permission? He must be your chief, who has taught you magic. I will cut off your hands and your feet on alternate sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of the palm-trees. Then you will know which of us is more severe in punishment, and more lasting.”"
  20,72,"They said, “We will not prefer you to the proofs that have come to us, and Him who created us. So issue whatever judgment you wish to issue. You can only rule in this lowly life"
