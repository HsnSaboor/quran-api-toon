quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By time
  103,2,The human being is in loss
  103,3,"Except those who believe, and do good works, and encourage truth, and recommend patience"
  104,1,Woe to every slanderer backbiter
  104,2,Who gathers wealth and counts it over
  104,3,Thinking that his wealth has made him immortal
  104,4,By no means. He will be thrown into the Crusher
  104,5,And what will make you realize what the Crusher is
  104,6,God's kindled Fire
  104,7,That laps to the hearts
  104,8,It closes in on them
  104,9,In extended columns
  105,1,Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the People of the Elephant
  105,2,Did He not make their plan go wrong
  105,3,He sent against them swarms of birds
  105,4,Throwing at them rocks of baked clay
  105,5,Leaving them like chewed-up leaves
