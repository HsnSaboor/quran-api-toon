quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,For the security of Quraish
  106,2,Their security during winter and summer journeys
  106,3,Let them worship the Lord of this House
  106,4,"Who has fed them against hunger, and has secured them against fear"
  107,1,Have you considered him who denies the religion
  107,2,It is he who mistreats the orphan
  107,3,And does not encourage the feeding of the poor
  107,4,So woe to those who pray
  107,5,Those who are heedless of their prayers
  107,6,Those who put on the appearance
  107,7,And withhold the assistance
  108,1,We have given you plenty
  108,2,So pray to your Lord and sacrifice
  108,3,He who hates you is the loser
