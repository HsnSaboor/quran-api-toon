quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,"Not equal are the inactive among the believers—except the disabled—and the strivers in the cause of God with their possessions and their persons. God prefers the strivers with their possessions and their persons above the inactive, by a degree. But God has promised goodness to both. Yet God favors the strivers, over the inactive, with a great reward"
  4,96,"Degrees from Him, and forgiveness, and mercy. God is Forgiving and Merciful"
  4,97,"While the angels are removing the souls of those who have wronged themselves, they will say, “What was the matter with you?” They will say, “We were oppressed in the land.” They will say, “Was God’s earth not vast enough for you to emigrate in it?” These—their refuge is Hell. What a wretched retreat"
  4,98,"Except for the weak among men, and women, and children who have no means to act, and no means to find a way out"
  4,99,These—God may well pardon them. God is Pardoning and Forgiving
  4,100,"Anyone who emigrates for the sake of God will find on earth many places of refuge, and plentitude. Anyone who leaves his home, emigrating to God and His Messenger, and then is overtaken by death, his compensation falls on God. God is Forgiver, Most Merciful"
  4,101,"When you travel in the land, there is no blame on you for shortening the prayers, if you fear that the disbelievers may harm you. The disbelievers are your manifest enemies"
