quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  13,29,For those who believe and do righteous deeds—for them is happiness and a beautiful return
  13,30,"Thus We sent you among a community before which other communities have passed away, that you may recite to them what We revealed to you. Yet they deny the Benevolent One. Say, “He is my Lord; there is no god but He; in Him I trust, and to Him is my repentance.”"
  13,31,"Even if there were a Quran, by which mountains could be set in motion, or by which the earth could be shattered, or by which the dead could be made to speak. In fact, every decision rests with God. Did the believers not give up and realize that had God willed, He would have guided all humanity? Disasters will continue to strike those who disbelieve, because of their deeds, or they fall near their homes, until God’s promise comes true. God never breaks a promise"
  13,32,"Messengers before you were ridiculed, but I granted the disbelievers respite, and then I seized them. What a punishment it was"
  13,33,"Is He who is watchful over the deeds of every soul? Yet they ascribe associates to God. Say, “Name them! Or are you informing Him of something on earth He does not know, or is it a show of words?” In fact, the scheming of those who disbelieve is made to appear good to them, and they are averted from the path. Whomever God misguides has no guide"
  13,34,"There is for them torment in the worldly life, but the torment of the Hereafter is harsher. And they have no defender against God"
