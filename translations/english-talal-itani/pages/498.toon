  44,40,The Day of Sorting Out is the appointed time for them all
  44,41,"The Day when no friend will avail a friend in any way, and they will not be helped"
  44,42,"Except for him upon whom God has mercy. He is the Mighty, the Merciful"
  44,43,The Tree of Bitterness
  44,44,The food of the sinner
  44,45,Like molten lead; boiling inside the bellies
  44,46,Like the boiling of seething water
  44,47,Seize him and drag him into the midst of Hell
  44,48,Then pour over his head the suffering of the Inferno
  44,49,Taste! You who were powerful and noble
  44,50,This is what you used to doubt
  44,51,"As for the righteous, they will be in a secure place"
  44,52,Amidst gardens and springs
  44,53,"Dressed in silk and brocade, facing one another"
  44,54,"So it is, and We will wed them to lovely companions"
  44,55,"They will call therein for every kind of fruit, in peace and security"
  44,56,"Therein they will not taste death, beyond the first death; and He will protect them from the torment of Hell"
  44,57,A favor from your Lord. That is the supreme salvation
  44,58,"We made it easy in your language, so that they may remember"
  44,59,So wait and watch. They too are waiting and watching
