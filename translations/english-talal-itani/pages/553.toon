  62,2,"It is He who sent among the unlettered a messenger from themselves; reciting His revelations to them, and purifying them, and teaching them the Scripture and wisdom; although they were in obvious error before that"
  62,3,"And others from them, who have not yet joined them. He is the Glorious, the Wise"
  62,4,"That is God’s grace, which He grants to whomever He wills. God is Possessor of limitless grace"
  62,5,"The example of those who were entrusted with the Torah, but then failed to uphold it, is like the donkey carrying works of literature. Miserable is the example of the people who denounce God’s revelations. God does not guide the wrongdoing people"
  62,6,"Say, “O you who follow Judaism; if you claim to be the chosen of God, to the exclusion of the rest of mankind, then wish for death if you are sincere.”"

  62,8,"Say, “The death from which you flee will catch up with you; then you will be returned to the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, and He will inform you of what you used to do.”"
