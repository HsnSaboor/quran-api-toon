quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"Who used to say, “Are you of those who believe"
  37,53,"That after we die and become dust and bones, we will be called to account?”"
  37,54,"He will say, “Will you have a look?”"
  37,55,"He will look, and will see him in the pit of Hell"
  37,56,"He will say, “By God, you almost ruined me"
  37,57,"Were it not for the grace of my Lord, I would have been among the arraigned.”"
  37,58,“We will not die
  37,59,"Except for our first death, and we will not be punished.”"
  37,60,This is the supreme triumph
  37,61,For the like of this let the workers work
  37,62,"Is this a better hospitality, or the Tree of Bitterness"
  37,63,We made it an ordeal for the unjust
  37,64,It is a tree that grows from the bottom of Hell
  37,65,Its fruits are like the devils’ heads
  37,66,"They will eat from it, and fill their bellies with it"
  37,67,"Then, on top of it, they will have a brew of boiling liquid"
  37,68,Then their return will be to the Blaze
  37,69,They had found their parents astray
  37,70,And rushed along in their footsteps
  37,71,And most of the ancients before them went astray
  37,72,Even though We sent messengers to warn them
  37,73,So observe the end of those who were warned
  37,74,Except for the sincere servants of God
  37,75,"And Noah called out to Us, and We are the Best of responders"
  37,76,And We saved him and his family from the great calamity
