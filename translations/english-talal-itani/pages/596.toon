quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,None will burn in it except the very wicked
  92,16,He who denies and turns away
  92,17,But the devout will avoid it
  92,18,He who gives his money to become pure
  92,19,Seeking no favor in return
  92,20,"Only seeking the acceptance of his Lord, the Most High"
  92,21,And he will be satisfied
  93,1,By the morning light
  93,2,And the night as it settles
  93,3,"Your Lord did not abandon you, nor did He forget"
  93,4,The Hereafter is better for you than the First
  93,5,"And your Lord will give you, and you will be satisfied"
  93,6,"Did He not find you orphaned, and sheltered you"
  93,7,"And found you wandering, and guided you"
  93,8,"And found you in need, and enriched you"
  93,9,"Therefore, do not mistreat the orphan"
  93,10,Nor rebuff the seeker
  93,11,But proclaim the blessings of your Lord
  94,1,Did We not soothe your heart
  94,2,And lift from you your burden
  94,3,Which weighed down your back
  94,4,And raised for you your reputation
  94,5,With hardship comes ease
  94,6,With hardship comes ease
  94,7,"When your work is done, turn to devotion"
  94,8,And to your Lord turn for everything
