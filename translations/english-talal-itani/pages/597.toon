quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the fig and the olive
  95,2,And Mount Sinai
  95,3,And this safe land
  95,4,We created man in the best design
  95,5,Then reduced him to the lowest of the low
  95,6,Except those who believe and do righteous deeds; for them is a reward without end
  95,7,So why do you still reject the religion
  95,8,Is God not the Wisest of the wise
  96,1,"Read: In the Name of your Lord who created"
  96,2,Created man from a clot
  96,3,"Read: And your Lord is the Most Generous"
  96,4,He who taught by the pen
  96,5,Taught man what he never knew
  96,6,"In fact, man oversteps all bounds"
  96,7,When he considers himself exempt
  96,8,But to your Lord is the return
  96,9,Have you seen him who prevents
  96,10,A servant when he prays
  96,11,Do you think he is upon guidance
  96,12,Or advocates righteousness
  96,13,Do you see how he disbelieved and turned away
  96,14,Does he not know that God sees
  96,15,"No. If he does not desist, We will drag him by the forelock"
  96,16,"A deceitful, sinful forelock"
  96,17,Let him call on his gang
  96,18,We will call the Guards
  96,19,"No, do not obey him; but kneel down, and come near"
