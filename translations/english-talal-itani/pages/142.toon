  6,111,"Even if We sent down the angels to them, and the dead spoke to them, and We gathered all things before them, they still would not believe, unless God wills; but most of them are ignorant"
  6,112,"Likewise, We have assigned for every prophet an enemy—human and jinn devils—inspiring one another with fancy words in order to deceive. But had your Lord willed, they would not have done it. So leave them to their fabrications"

  6,115,"The Word of your Lord has been completed, in truth and justice. There is no changing to His words. He is the Hearer, the Knower"
  6,116,"If you were to obey most of those on earth, they would divert you from God’s path. They follow nothing but assumptions, and they only conjecture"
  6,117,"Your Lord knows best who strays from His path, and He knows best the guided ones"
  6,118,"So eat of that over which the Name of God was pronounced, if you indeed believe in His revelations"
