  28,60,Kandi icyo mwahawe cyose ni umunezero w’ubuzima bw’isi n’umutako wayo. Naho ibiri kwa Allah (ingororano) ni byo byiza kandi bizahoraho. Ese ntimugira ubwenge
  28,61,"Ese uwo twasezeranyije isezerano ryiza (ijuru) maze akazaribona, ni kimwe n’uwo twahaye umunezero w’ubuzima bw’isi (akaba ari bwo ahitamo gusa) maze ku munsi w’imperuka akazaba mu bazazanwa (ngo bahanwe)"
  28,62,"And [warn of] the Day He will call them and say, \"Where are My 'partners' which you used to claim"
  28,63,"Those upon whom the word will have come into effect will say, \"Our Lord, these are the ones we led to error. We led them to error just as we were in error. We declare our disassociation [from them] to You. They did not used to worship us"
  28,64,"And it will be said, \"Invoke your 'partners' \" and they will invoke them; but they will not respond to them, and they will see the punishment. If only they had followed guidance"
  28,65,"And [mention] the Day He will call them and say, \"What did you answer the messengers"
