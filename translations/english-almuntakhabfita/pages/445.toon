quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  36,71,Do the infidels not see that besides Our handiwork We have created for them cattle and made them the owners and the masters thereof
  36,72,And We made them –the cattle– subservient to them in one way or other; some of them do they ride and of others they eat
  36,73,"And they order them in subservience to their profitable end and design – skin for leather, fur for warmth – and of their milk they drink. Do they not feel obligated and in consequence impel themselves to gratitude and gratefulness"
  36,74,"Yet they take besides Allah other deities whom or which they regard, with extreme devotion and adore with appropriate acts and rites that they might hopefully afford them help"
  36,75,"When in fact the false gods have no power to be of avail to them ever, not to mention their total inability to afford them help. On the contrary it is the infidels who afford them protection and round about them they are garrisoned like a camp of faithful soldiery"
  36,76,"Therefore, let not their vain and unreasonable discourse O Muhammed grieve you at heart. We do know what they converse secretly or whisper under their breath and what they suggest secretly to the mind and all that their breasts store of thoughts and feelings. And We are well acquainted with all that they utter loudly and with all that is being said"
  36,77,Does man not perceive mentally and by visual tokens that We brought him into being from a seed -the constituent part of emitted fluid!- Yet he sets himself against Allah and displays his thought in his actions
  36,78,"And he draws meaningless parallels and sets forth to Us comparisons and he expresses his thoughts in words, thus: \"Who shall restore life\", he asks, \"to these bones when they have undergone morbid changes and degeneracy"
  36,79,"Say to him: \"He Who brought them into being in the beginning when He started creation from nothingness shall restore them to life, and He is AL-'Alim of the whole and of all in all"
  36,80,"Who rendered for you from the green trees fuel for fire-wood, coal, oil, gas – and you cause it to burn"
  36,81,"Is He Who has created the heavens and the earth not able to create their likes anew! Indeed He is. And He is the Creator Supreme, AL-'Alim of all"
  36,82,"Whenever it is His will to bring, anything (animate or inanimate) into being, all it takes is to say \"Be\" and \"it is"
  36,83,"Wherefore. blessed be He and praise to Him Who has the glorious attributes, in whose hands reside the Sovereign Authority and the supreme controlling power of the whole and of all in all and back to Him shall all of you return"
