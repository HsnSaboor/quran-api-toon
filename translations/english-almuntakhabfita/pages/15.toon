quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,94,"Say to them, O Muhammad: \"If you truly believe in eternal bliss, excluding all else then wish yourselves dead if you declare the truth"
  2,95,But never shall they wish their death because of what their wrongful hands have committed; and Allah knows the wrongful well
  2,96,"You shall find them, O Muhammad, of all people, the most eager, for longevity, even more than the Pagans, none of them aims for the grave but would rather be entangled in the web of life for a thousand years. But nothing shall alter his punitive destiny even if he is carried through the stealing steps of age to this desired advanced life span, and Allah is Bassirun (Omnipresent): He sees all that they do"
  2,97,"Say to them, O Muhammad: they must realize he who defies Jibril (Gabriel), it is he who imparts the Quran to your consciousness with Allah’s Authority, corroborating AL-Tawrah and carrying the torch of truth guiding into all truth, inspiring those with faithful hearts with blissful tidings"
  2,98,"He who defies Allah, His angels, His Prophets, Jibril and Mikhail, must realise that Allah is at enmity with those who deny Him and deny those who serve Him"
  2,99,"We have imparted to you, O Muhammad, clear Quranic revelations guiding away from want of spiritual and intellectual vision into illumination and enlightenment, and none refuses to acknowledge them but the perverse depraved and faithless"
  2,100,"Is it not the case that when they make a promise to you, O Muhammad and to others before you, some of them always break it? In fact, most of them are faithlessly disposed"
  2,101,"And when the prophesy in the authentic AL-Tawrah was fulfilled and the Prophet Muhammad arrived carrying the final message from Allah with the Quran validating AL-Tawrah, some of them shut their eyes to the prophesy ignoring their own Book which conforms to the will of Allah and turned their backs upon it as if they were never aware"
