quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  25,12,"No sooner do they come within the range of its sight than they hear its roaring under the influence of rage, heaving sighs of woe for the evil that shall befall them"
  25,13,"And when they are cast in its grim confines bound to their kind, and their feet chained to their necks they shall invoke extinction and wish they could perish"
  25,14,"But they are told: \"Do not invoke extinction once but invoke it repeatedly"
  25,15,"Say to them: \"Is this troublesome and distressing situation better or the garden of Eternity –Paradise- promised to those in whose hearts reigns piety! the garden which Allah has set apart for the requital of those faithful to Him, and He has determined that it shall be their destination"
  25,16,"The garden wherein they shall have whatever object of desire affording pleasure and satisfaction. Any wish they express in words or in thought will be instantly fulfilled, For they will have passed through nature to Eternity; a promise Allah binds Himself to, and treats as an obligation"
  25,17,"And in Day of Judgement when He throngs them together with those objects - animate or inanimate- they worshipped, He shall question those gods: \"Did you mislead these servants of Mine, or did they stray from the prescribed path of their own accord"
  25,18,"Glory be to you. \"O Allah\", they shall say, and extolled are Your glorious attributes. How could we! when it is not at all befitting to take tutelary guardians besides You! The truth is that you O Allah granted these people together with their fathers comfort and enjoyment and all that advantaged them of Your blessings in life until they forgot to apply remembrance to You and became oblivious of divine revelation. And by consequence they had sealed their own fate and deserved destruction"
  25,19,"Then the infidels shall be told: \"You see, your gods have accused you of falsehood and want of conformity to fact and by consequence you shall not escape the torment nor can you be afforded help. And now a warning is issued to all, Thus, you people at large must know that he who is wrongful of actions shall taste the torment laid upon the damned"
  25,20,"We never sent Messengers before you O Muhammad but were human who ate food and could not survive without alimentation and they moved about from place to place on foot. We also tested the people by exposing opposites -contrary in nature, character, tendency, status, wealth- to each other and those with thoughts of sedition in one toward another. Therefore, will you people -who have conformed to Islam- be persistent, constant and unwearied in the face of difficulties and hindrances and exercise patience! Your Creator is Bassirun (Omnipresent Whose constant vigilance has always been extended to all His creatures)"
