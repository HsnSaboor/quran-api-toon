quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,"Among us -the Jinn- are those who have surrendered themselves to Allah and others who deviated from what is just and right\". \"and those who have submitted to Allah have in effect sought the path of safety and righteousness, the path which pleases Allah and invites His mercy on their souls"
  72,15,Those who swerve from the path of righteousness have been destined to be the fuel for Hell
  72,16,"Had they - the Pagans - followed the path of rectitude, We would have blessed them, and heaven would have prospered them with an abundance of rain mixed with blessings, spiritual, moral and material means of sustenance"
  72,17,"But We would have also used these blessings to test and try their beliefs and their true inclination and he who falls short of remembering Allah his Creator, will Allah subject him to distressing and condign punishment"
  72,18,"Mosques belong solely to Allah, therefore, invoke no one ever with Allah"
  72,19,"When the Messenger invoked Allah and recited the Quran, the Pagans among mankind and the Jinn beset him on all sides to suppress the flow of the new faith"
  72,20,"Say to them: \"I only invoke Allah, my Creator, with whom I incorporate none"
  72,21,"Tell them: \"It is not within my power to afflict you with harm nor can I steer your mental consent to accept the Faith on the ground of authority"
  72,22,"Say to them: \"No one can avert Allah's wrath on me if I fail to proclaim the Divine message, nor will I find besides Him anyone to afford me refuge"
  72,23,"But I can only submit to you the facts revealed by Allah and deliver to you His Divine Message, and he who disobeys Allah and His Messenger shall suffer Hell wherein he and such persons shall remain forever"
  72,24,"And when it is the Day to see what has been promised, there and then shall they realize who has hardly any help to offer and has the least force of numbers"
  72,25,"Say to them: \"I do not know whether the promised Day of Judgment is close at hand or Allah has ordained that it be remote in time"
  72,26,He -Allah- alone knows the unknown and realizes the unseen and He keeps what is beyond human comprehension and imparts the knowledge thereof to no one
  72,27,Except to a Messenger whom He chooses and then He besets him on all sides with guardian angels to protect him and protect the Book with which He has put him in trust
  72,28,But Allah would know whether His Messengers have proclaimed their Creator's messages or they did not and He knows well what is within them and what is without; He has computed everything in a determinate number
