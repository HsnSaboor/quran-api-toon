quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  72,1,"Say to the people: \" I have been inspired by Allah that a certain number of the Jinn listened to the recital of the sacred revelations and said: \"we have heard an exceptional Quran"
  72,2,"It guides to the path of righteousness and impresses the image of virtue upon the hearts, that it prompted giving credence to it and holding it as true, and never shall we incorporate with Allah, our Creator, anyone else"
  72,3,Exalted be He Who is far above all and beyond all comprehension. Never did He take a wife nor did He beget a son
  72,4,Now we realize that AL-Shaytan (Satan) and the satanic among us have related to Allah defiant impiety and took delight in portraying falsehood
  72,5,Nor could we conceive that among the men and the Jinn there would be those who are that wicked as to relate to Allah falsehood
  72,6,"We found that some men among mankind used to plead earnestly to some men among the Jinn for averting evil, but instead, the Jinn inflicted them with material harm and made them shudder with horror and with fear and dread which dwelt without an end"
  72,7,The evil among us -the Jinn- thought as did the evil among mankind that Allah would not send another Messenger anymore nor would He effect resurrection
  72,8,We touched the lower heaven but we found it filled with stern guards and fiery celestial bodies
  72,9,Long did we sit peering deep into heaven to spy what is being said or discussed in the heaven's realm. But now he of us who endeavours to pry into the realm is followed by a fiery celestial body and suffers annihilation
  72,10,Nevertheless we do not know whether those domiciled on earth are destined to suffer or Allah will impress upon their hearts His divine influence which operates in men to regenerate and sanctify and to impart strength to endure trial and resist temptation
  72,11,"Yet among us -the Jinn- are those who are righteous, acting rightly and justly and those proceeding in different directions from that ordained by Allah"
  72,12,We have realized that we will never be able to defeat Allah nor frustrate Him had we escaped
  72,13,"And when we heard the Quran We gave credence to it and held it as true and realized that he who accepts Allah, his Creator, and believes in Him suffers no loss nor injustice"
