quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,He will not find here any who would afford him help or deliver him from Allah's retributory punishment
  69,36,Nor will he feed except upon the bloody rotten discharges
  69,37,Which no one consumes but the wicked who are destined to make their abode in Hell
  69,38,I swear by all that you can see
  69,39,And by all that you cannot see
  69,40,That the words uttered are sacred words expressed by an honourable Messenger -the Spirit or the Messenger- held in high esteem
  69,41,And not a gifted utterance championed by a poet that you could hardly believe
  69,42,"Nor is it a prophecy foretold by a foreteller that you do not, reflect upon with close attention"
  69,43,"It -the utterance- is that of sacred words revealed by Allah, the Creator of the worlds, past present and those to come"
  69,44,And if he -the Messenger- had uttered error against Us and his heart worked iniquity
  69,45,We. would have smitten him by the right
  69,46,And We would have broken the continuity of blood flow in his major artery close to his heart besides a grievous woeful future plight
  69,47,And no one among~ you could defend him from Us
  69,48,But it -the utterance- is a Revelation to remind those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah
  69,49,"We do know that among you people are some who refuse to admit the truth of the Quran, albeit it is convincing, and quite clear"
  69,50,And that it has distressed the minds of those who refuse to acknowledge Allah and are satisfied with the age of discord
  69,51,But it is the Absolute Truth which together with reality does accord
  69,52,"And so, praise the attributes and advance the glory of the Name of Allah, your Creator"
  70,1,"Some Pagan once asked: \"When do we expect our turn to suffer that punitive punishment and the encounter with the promised Day of Judgement"
  70,2,A retributive punishment stored for the infidels and there is just not any expedient nor anyone in the heaven's realm or on earth that can avert it
  70,3,"A retributive punishment which cannot be averted once it has been decided by Allah Who is the object of effort, ambition and destination; Allah the Provider of the various rates of motion suitable to the various objects"
  70,4,To Him ascend the angels and the souls or the Spirit fast as they press their rate of motion to attain their purpose in a day of Allah's calendar that equals fifty thousand years of the earthly calendar
  70,5,"Therefore endure O Muhammad their attitude with composure, and quietly await the course of events"
  70,6,"They -the infidels- see it (that is) that day of the Eventful Event far and away, remote in time"
  70,7,"While We, and the believers, see it close at hand and near fulfilment"
  70,8,That is the Day when the heavens shall look like a metallic substance melted in oil
  70,9,and the mountains shall be like carded wool
  70,10,and no friend puts a question to a friend or asks about him. This is an endless moment of anxiety and fear to concern oneself even with the closest whom he or she had rendered dear
