quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  68,16,"We shall impress on him a stigma of infamy and furnish him with a distorted, contemptuous and ugly disproportionate snout"
  68,17,We have put them -your people- O Muhammad to the test as We had tried the owners of the orchard who decided upon picking up all the fruits by the morrow at dawn to escape notice and evade paying the poor their due. They disregarded alms which are but the vehicles of prayer
  68,18,No one did they except and the decision was irrevocable
  68,19,But the orchard was visited by a divine dispensation which did away with it at one blow while they were asleep
  68,20,"So that by morning it stood desolate and bare, and there was nothing left for them to reap"
  68,21,When they woke up they held discourse to hasten the course of action and expedite their desire
  68,22,"Let us go\", said one of them, \"and do what you have planned to do if you are to serve your purpose"
  68,23,And so they went onward to their orchard whispering to each other as to how they would accomplish their desire
  68,24,That no indigent shall have the chance to break in and seek any share to which he might aspire
  68,25,And thus they finally and firmly resolved not to be moved from their purpose and course of action
  68,26,"And when they saw the orchard had been changed out of all recognition and their dreams which they cherished with unreasonable affection were simply a reverie, they said: \"We must have missed our way"
  68,27,"But having recognized the calamity, they said : \"We have suffered a big loss; we will get no return for our labour and effort, and our expectant waiting has come to a moist mirage in desert eyes"
  68,28,"The moderate among them said : \"Would it not have been befitting, as I advised, had we praised Allah and rendered thanks for the benefits that to us, He has given"
  68,29,"Now, they said, \"Glory to You, our Creator; we have been wrongful of the actions we harmfully performed yet we knew they are utterly forbidden"
  68,30,Then they turned round on each other in reproach for the ingratitude to Allah and for the idea of evading benevolence to the poor
  68,31,"How denunciated shall we be\" they said. \"We went beyond the limits prescribed by Allah and offended against the poor and it serves us right"
  68,32,"It is hoped that Allah, our Creator, may compensate us for our losses with what is better\". And thus they, in lowliest plight, repentant stood"
  68,33,"Such is the retributory punishment, here, for those who go beyond the limits prescribed by Allah and say to their money \"my Allah art thou \" or \" you are my god \", and deny the poor what is due, and greater shall be the punishment Hereafter if only people knew"
  68,34,But the righteous shall Allah admit in the bliss and the beatitude of His heaven’s realm
  68,35,"Or shall We then treat those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, the same as We treat those who do not regard Allah nor His divine law"
  68,36,How could you be so bold -you people- as to think beyond all bounds of prudence and discretion
  68,37,Or do you people have a Book which was revealed to you and you use it as a valid reference and you apply the rules which bear upon it
  68,38,And you choose from it what suits you and make use of it as a convenient aid to your intentions
  68,39,"Or did you ratify with Us covenants with unquestionable validity until the Day of Resurrection, and you are then judged according to your desire and expected satisfaction"
  68,40,"Ask them O Muhammad \"who has championed the idea and shall offer himself as the candidate who presents a firm front and guarantees them against all exactions"
  68,41,"Or do they have deities sharing with Allah His divine nature that they incorporate with Him? If so, ask them to bring them over if they are declaring the truth"
  68,42,"Wait, a Day shall come when the truth comes to light and their records are exposed, and distress, horror and crushing sorrow are imposed and now they are called to prostrate before their Creator but they cannot"
