quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,123,"O you who have conformed to Islam: wage war against the infidels who dwell in the adjacent towns round about you; they are a source of danger to you. Let them feel that you are rigorous, unbending, firm and stern but you must realize that Allah upholds those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him"
  9,124,"When a Surah is sent down, some of them -the hypocrites- insolently and mockingly say to each other: who among you has this Surah impressed his heart with religious and spiritual virtues? Indeed those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand are receptive to divine knowledge; it gives them moral support and confidence and increases their force of reason; their hearts become impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues. Stirred by emotion, they rejoice beyond a common joy"
  9,125,Whereas it -the Surah- adds doubt to those whose ill-natured hearts reflect the morbidity inherent in their innermost being and gives them occasion to uncertainty and increases the degree of their infidelity. They will depart life captivated in disbelief
  9,126,"Do they not perceive by physical and mental sight what is below the surface! They are subjected to a severe test and a strain and they are put to straits once or twice every year that they may hopefully in lowliest plight repentant stand, but they neither repent nor do they reflect"
  9,127,"And when a Surah is sent down, they look at one another and express their thoughts in words, thus: \"Does anyone see you\", they ask, and they take their leave. May Allah turn their hearts and thoughts away from the truth and close their hearts' ears to admonition; they lack diligence and they are a people who have no comprehension of Allah nor of the spoken discourse of reason narrated by His Messenger"
  9,128,"O you people: There has come to you a Messenger raised in your midst and related to you by kinship. He is grieved at heart and affected with deep sorrow to see you perfect your ruin and be destroyed by your iniquities which oppress his feelings and his mind. You are his object of care and deep concern with view to guiding you to the path of righteousness, and he is kind, tender and merciful to those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand"
  9,129,"Nonetheless, if they O Muhammad should close their hearts' ears and direct their thoughts away from you, then you simply express in words the invocatory prayer, thus: \" Enough is Allah for me; in Him do I find the answer to my purpose, my hopes and my needs; there is no Ilah but He; in Him I trust and He is the Absolute Sovereign of the Great Throne of dominion, authority, grace and mercy"
