quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,No one suffers it but the unfortunate who obstinately denies the truth and to arrogance does he aspire
  92,16,Who whole heartedly denies Allah and deviates from the path of righteousness and piety
  92,17,But saved from it will be the one who entertains the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and carries his reverence to Allah from contemplation to reality
  92,18,Who spends of his wealth in benefaction
  92,19,"With no obligation to any, or expectation of a reward or a favour in return or a mundane satisfaction"
  92,20,"But only on account of his interest, to please Allah, his Creator – the Supreme -, and to gain His welcome into His realm and be held precious in His esteem; a welcome featured by the illumination proceeding from Him and by the language spoken by His countenance"
  92,21,Such a person shall be rewarded to his satisfaction
  93,1,By the forenoon
  93,2,And by the night when life is reduced to quietness and darkness prevails and falls into a swoon
  93,3,"Allah your Creator, has not forsaken you nor does He dislike you or with you He is displeased"
  93,4,Indeed what awaits you in the Hereafter far excels all that you will experience here with all the gratification and happiness to be occasioned by future victory and satisfaction
  93,5,"And Allah, your Creator, shall bestow on you gratuitously what will meet with your expectation of blessing and benefaction"
  93,6,Did He not find you an orphan and He gave you shelter and care through your kinsman
  93,7,Did He not find you unsettled and not freed from doubt and uncertainty and He guided you to the path of righteousness and filled your breast with reverential bliss
  93,8,And did He not find you needy and He made you independent
  93,9,"Therefore, do not mistreat the orphan or humiliate"
  93,10,"Nor be unkind to the one who addresses a petition to you, be it for"
  93,11,And express your gratitude by announcing Allah's bounty upon you and all grace abounding in you
  94,1,"Did We not solace you O Muhammad and make joyful your bosom (and make your spirit thirsty for knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light)"
  94,2,And did We not unload your burden of the heavy responsibility (by prompting you to feel drawn to it by invisible influence making you hug it to your heart and inducing you to lift to Us your inward sight)
  94,3,"A burden of an immense magnitude, We realize was more than your back could bear"
  94,4,"And did We not praise your name to fame (that you are being mentioned by others with admiration, adoration and commendation)"
  94,5,In instances of hardship there is always included something of relief
  94,6,"Yes, indeed, with an instance of hardship there is always included something of relief"
  94,7,"Therefore, when you are free of worldly duties, engage in worship and meditation"
  94,8,"And make Allah your Creator, the heart of your purpose and the goal of contemplation"
