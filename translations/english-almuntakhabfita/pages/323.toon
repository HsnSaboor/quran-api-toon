quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  21,11,"And think but this: how many towns, whose inhabitants were wrongful of actions, did We destroy and replace by other people"
  21,12,"And when they sensed Our wrath approaching, in vain for their life, they fled to other places"
  21,13,"In irony they were told-: do not flee but go back to your lustful life and to your dwellings; you may have much to answer for"
  21,14,"There and then they exclaimed, thus: Woe betide us, we were indeed wrongful of actions"
  21,15,They kept bewailing their misfortune until We reduced them to a useless form like reaped field of corn
  21,16,We never created the heavens and the earth and all that is between just for fun
  21,17,Had We purposed to have fun or diversion We would have had recourse to what We have in Our heaven's realm if indeed We meant to do so
  21,18,But what befits Our Supremacy is to dash fiction and falsehood with truth so that it is erased and vanished wherefore woe betide you for what you insolently ascribe to Allah
  21,19,"And to Allah alone belong all that is in the heavens and on earth, and those serving in His realm of heaven do not pride themselves nor show inordinate self- esteem for serving Him and prostrating to Him in adoration nor do they ever grow weary"
  21,20,"They .celebrate and glorify their Creator and extol His glorious attributes night and day and they never lose vigour, grow dull nor do they lose interest"
  21,21,Could it be that they- the idolaters-have taken earthly objects of worship who can raise the dead and restore them to life
  21,22,"Indeed, if there be Ilahs other than Allah or sharing His divine nature and attributes, the heavens and the earth would have become corrupt and been ruined. Therefore, praise be to Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes the sole Sovereign of the Supreme Throne. He is far above what they ascribe to Him"
  21,23,"He is never questioned or examined judicially for whatever He does, whereas they as a whole shall have much to answer for"
  21,24,"Or have they taken besides Allah, the Creator, other gods which were indicated to them in previous Scriptures? if so, say to them O Muhammad: \"Give us convincing evidence to this effect. This Quran is the message followed by my fellows in faith and before it were the Scriptures followed by those of old. And no where do we final but monotheisms\" But indeed most of them fail to comprehend the truth and so they do not receive it with consenting minds"
