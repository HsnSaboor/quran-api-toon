quran[24]{c,v,t}:

  26,161,"Their brother Lut tried hard to induce them to open their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes and listen to exhortation. Entertaining expectation of something desired, he -Lut- said to them: \"Will you not keep in awe of Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him"
  26,162,"I am\", he added, \"a Messenger entrusted with a divine message and here do I relate it to you in honour and sincerity"
  26,163,A message which exacts your reverence for Allah and obedience to me
  26,164,"I\" he said, \"do not charge you a price for imparting to you Allah's disclosures of divine knowledge, wisdom and practical divinity, my reward rests at His hands Creator of the worlds"
  26,165,"Do you realize what you are doing\"! he added \"of all intellectual created beings, you gratify your sexual appetite by copulating the males"
  26,166,"And you forsake your natural mates who are created by Him , for the purpose based upon the innate moral feeling of mankind\". In fact you are a people who have defiantly transgressed the divine as well as the moral laws"

  26,170,We delivered him along with his family from the people who were wrongful of actions
  26,171,"except a woman who had been carried through the stealing steps of age to advanced life, who remained with those behind. (Lut.'s wife who approved this evil practice)"
  26,172,And We reduced the rest to a useless form
  26,173,We poured down upon them a direful rain (of fire and brimstone) and how evil and devastating was the rain on the heads of those who defiantly ignored Allah's warning

  26,175,"Allah, your Creator, is indeed AL-Aziz and AL-Rahim"
