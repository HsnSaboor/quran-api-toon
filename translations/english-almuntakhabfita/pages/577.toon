quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,"There and then, no intercession can profit them or afford them help"
  74,49,But why would they reject admonition and refuse to take heed
  74,50,As if they were zebras
  74,51,Rushing away from a lion in a stampede
  74,52,Ironically every one of these infidels wants a Scripture to be revealed to him and alone
  74,53,"But no, they deny the Hereafter and their denial of it drives them to seek pleasure in vices instead of virtues and they think what they will is fate"
  74,54,Yet this Quran is the spirit of truth guiding into all truth and inducing those whose hearts' ears are open to lift to Allah their inward sight and keep Him always in mind
  74,55,He who wishes to do so is left to his conscience to bind
  74,56,"But no wish would be fulfilled until Allah has so willed, He is Reverence personified. He is the Creator Who merits profound reverence and He is the Absolute Source of forgiveness, and to those who repent, perhaps He will relent and quit them all His debt"
  75,1,I swear by the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,and by the self - reproaching soul
  75,3,"Does man think We are unable to assemble his bones? But indeed We are, even after they have been scattered or reduced to dust"
  75,4,But also each finger tip with its mark or prints We will be able to reconstruct
  75,5,"Indeed, impudent is he who has no shame of his sins"
  75,6,and in positive unbelief he asks as to when is that alleged Day of Resurrection
  75,7,Then when the sight is dazed by terror and fright
  75,8,and the moon is eclipsed and reflects no light
  75,9,and the sun and the moon lose orbit and draw together in one mass and go out of shape
  75,10,Shall man wonder as to which way to turn in order to have recourse to a shelter as a means of escape
  75,11,But never; there is no shelter to recourse to
  75,12,"For now to Allah, your Creator, does the one - way journey proceed"
  75,13,There and then shall man be informed of all the good he had done and the evil he committed and of all he had neglected or omitted
  75,14,"Each one shall be his own witness, and his deeds shall be a witness of his worth. He knows exactly all that he had done and he also knows if he had perverted best things to worst abuse or to their meanest use"
  75,15,and of no import shall be his excuse
  75,16,"Do not rush O Muhammad to speak, but hold your tongue and listen to what the Angel relates"
  75,17,"We are responsible for imprinting it in your heart and impressing it on your mind, and We are responsible for its compilation and for its perusal"
  75,18,"When We read it to you, you follow its intonation"
  75,19,We are responsible for its interpretation
