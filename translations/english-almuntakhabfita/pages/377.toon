quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  27,1,"(Ta) S. (Seen) the Surah opens with these, introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated. These are the divinely discoursed verses flowing with the precision and grace symbolic of the Quran, which is the spirit of truth guiding into all truth"
  27,2,"It is a guide leading and directing mankind in their course of action, way of life and in the manner of conducting themselves and their affairs besides being joyful tidings to those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues"
  27,3,Who engage in the act of worship and give alms -for alms are but the vehicles of prayer- and look at the Hereafter as the most undoubted event
  27,4,"As to those who deny the Hereafter and refuse to admit the truth of Resurrection, they have lost the intuitive recognition and perception of the truth. Acting upon their struggle in defiance of the truth, We have allured them to a brighter present and a happier destiny so that their minds be thrown into confusion and lose sight of the truth until they commit themselves to loss in the maze of error"
  27,5,These are they who are destined to the torment laid upon the damned. They are the biggest losers-whose crime has lost them all hope of forgiveness
  27,6,"And you -Muhammad, the chosen recipient- do receive the Quran, sent down to you, from its prime Source, The Originator of all knowledge, Who is Hakimun (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensation,) and 'Alimun (the Omniscient)"
  27,7,"Mussa said to his family: I have just seen a fire, you stay here, I might be able to fetch you some information relative to the direction we pursue or fetch you a brand from the burning wood to kindle a fire to warm you up"
  27,8,"And when he reached the destined spot, he was called to and was told: \"Blessed be those who are in the fire and those around, and extolled are the glorious attributes of Allah, The Creator of the worlds, the visible and the invisible, past, present and those to come"
  27,9,"O Mussa,\" the voice continued, \"I am Allah and it is only I, AL-Aziz (the Almighty), AL-Hakim (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)"
  27,10,"Drop your staff\". He said to Mussa. And when Mussa saw it moving as though it were a serpent personified, he withdrew in the face of danger and did not return. But he was told: \"O Mussa do not be afraid and cast out of your mind the emotion of fear, for My Messengers fear naught in My immediate presence"
  27,11,"Except him who has deviated from equity, justice and goodness. but, he exchanged; thereafter the evil for what is good shall he and such persons find that I am indeed AL-Gafur (the forgiving) and AL-Rahim"
  27,12,"And, Allah added, \"put your hand into your bosom it shall come out transfigured in a radiance of white divine light unharmed and all sound, one of nine divine signs you shall present to Pharaoh and his people who have confirmed themselves in the horrid purpose and the ill intention"
  27,13,And when Our divine convincing signs were presented to them they blinded their minds' eyes and labeled them as magic with over-mastering influence
