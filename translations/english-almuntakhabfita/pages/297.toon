quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,28,"Be patient O Muhammad and rest content with those who invoke Allah's mercy and conciliation morning and evening in quest of nothing but His acceptance and His countenance speaking good will. And let not your mind's eyes turn aside from them or vacillate between them and the worldly-minded, setting your thoughts upon the ephemeral and fleeting glories of the world. Nor should you obey the one neglecting his duty to Allah and by consequence We closed his heart's ears, the one who counsels deaf and lusts after his vain desires and carries his vanity to excess that he cannot be reclaimed from a life of vice nor will he be reclaimed by Allah's grace"
  18,29,"And say to them: \"Allah's truth has come to guide us into all truth and he who wishes to acknowledge it with judgement and choice is free to do so and he who wishes to reject it is free to do so. We have prepared for the wrongful of actions a fire whose scorching and merciless flames beset them on all sides as if it were a bed having an arched canopy and covered sides. As often as they cry for help they are given a draught of boiling water like molten brass or molten lead scalding the faces; evil indeed is the drink and evil is the society"
  18,30,"Indeed those whose hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety are the recipients of Allah's mercy and divine reward. We never annul, cancel or render unprofitable the due return accruing from a good deed imprinted with wisdom and piety"
  18,31,"Such persons are promised the gardens of Eden beneath which rivers flow. They are adorned therein with golden bracelets and vested in green silken attire and rich brocade and reclining on dignified thrones, How excellent is the reward and how excellent is the society"
  18,32,"Give them O Muhammad an example by which moral and spiritual relations are typically set forth, the example illustrating the two men; on one of them -the rich- We bestowed two orchards enclosing grape vines and surrounded by palm trees with plants in between"
  18,33,"Both orchards yielded their produce in due season and never failed to yield all that both will hold, and in their midst We caused a river to flow with a copious stream"
  18,34,"Abundant was the produce that he -the rich- boasted his wit and said to his fellow -man- the poor: \"I have more advantages than you have; I have abundant means at command and my family and my men far exceed yours in numerosity"
