quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  35,31,And rest assured O Muhammad that all that We inspire to you of the Book -the Quran- is indeed the truth personified. It corroborates and confirms what had preceded of divine Books and Scriptures. He is indeed Khabirun (Omniscient) and Bassirun (the Omnipresent) Whose constant vigilance is extended to all His creatures
  35,32,"And We made the Book an heritage We bequeathed to such of Our servants as We have chosen and taken by preference. Some of them, the wrongful of actions, are being unfair to themselves.
