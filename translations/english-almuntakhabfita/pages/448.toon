quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"Who used to say to me: Do you honestly believe in resurrection and its aftermath"
  37,53,"Do you mean, that after we die and be reduced to dust and disintegrated bones, we will be restored to life and have much to answer for"
  37,54,"Then he will say to those around: \"Do you see those who made their abode in Hell"
  37,55,"And he looks, only to see him -his companion in life- in the abyss of Hell"
  37,56,"And there, he will exclaim against his companion: \"Good gracious, you almost succeeded in making of me a child of perdition and an inheritor of Hell"
  37,57,"Had it not been\", he will say, \"for Allah's mercy and grace l would have been among those dragged and hauled over the flames in the pit of Hell"
  37,58,"And he will ask himself wondering thus: \"is it then that having paid nature its debt we suffer no death"
  37,59,Other than that first death we suffered in the world below and we live from hence to forever exempt from heavens high jurisdiction and punishment
  37,60,"This is indeed great\", he will say, \"and triumph supreme"
  37,61,For the accomplishment of a like exalted end Hereafter shall endeavour those who aspire to attain it
  37,62,Now is this honoured end affording happiness and delightful provision better or the entertainment which provides the evil fruit plucked from the obnoxious tree of zaqqum
  37,63,The tree We caused to grow especially for the trial in sharp tribulation and misery of the wrongful of actions
  37,64,It is a tree springing up from the pit in the abysm of Hell
  37,65,A tree whose branches are full of spadicies looking as though they were the abhorrent heads of the devils
  37,66,It is the source of aliment the infidels shall eat and fill their bellies
  37,67,And their thirst shall be quenched with a mixture of repulsive ingredients dissolved in boiling water
  37,68,Having drunk the cup of misery they are cast back into the abysm of Hell
  37,69,They found their fathers treading the wrong path leading to the loss in the maze of error
  37,70,And with their hearts' ears closed and with their minds' eyes blind they insisted on walking in their fathers' footsteps
  37,71,Similarly behaved long before them most of those of old; they insisted on treading the path of error
  37,72,Notwithstanding that We did send to them Messengers as spectacles and warnings
  37,73,And there you can see the fatal consequence of those whom We exhorted -but they counselled deaf
  37,74,But excluded from that ill-fate were those votaries faithful to Allah and sincere in mind and spirit
  37,75,Nuh invoked Us appealing for aid and how excellent was the divine response
  37,76,And We delivered him together with his family excluding his son and the few of his people who followed him from the distressful event exhaustive to the mind
