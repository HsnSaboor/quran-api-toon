quran[3]{c,v,t}:
  4,92,"Observe particularly: It is not right for a believer who has conformed to Islam to kill another believer of the same law unless it be by mistake. And he who kills a Muslim by chance and guilt does not reside in the intention shall run into some consequences in expiation of his wrong, thus"
  4,93,"And he who kills a believer who has conformed to Islam and the guilt resides in the intention, shall be destined to Hell wherein he will have passed through nature to eternal suffering and he will have come within the measure of Allah's wrath and curse; this is besides the torment prepared by Providence to lay upon the damned"
  4,94,"O you who have conformed to Islam: When you journey into a foreign land in Allah's cause, you must distinguish by the sight and by other senses the disposition of the people whether or not they have conformed to Islam lest you spoil your best designs by faulty actuation. Nor should you say to anyone who greets you: \"You are not a Muslim;\" prompted by selfish motive principles of considering him a fit subject for plunder, in quest of the fleeting and evanescent glory of life below when glory, valuables, possessions and all graces abound in heaven's realm. Remember, if he is not a believer in Allah, thus were you before but Allah graced you with guidance to His path of righteousness. Therefore, discern the truth from what is false; Allah is ever 'Alimun of all that you do"
