quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  41,12,"Then He set them in order and arranged them in seven heavens in two days of the same unit of time and designated to each heaven its destined purpose \" and We decorated the lowermost heaven with lamps or heavenly bodies and to keep guard; a plan determined by AL-Aziz and AL-Alim (the almighty and the Omniscient)"
  41,13,"Should they -the unbelievers- as yet turn away and counsel deaf, then say to them: \"I warn you of an injurious rout tempest like the thunderbolt which overtook the 'Adites and the Thamudites"
  41,14,"Their Messengers, who were spectacles and warnings, approached them from every angle and left no stone unturned advising them to worship no one but Allah, but they counselled deaf and said: \"Had Allah, our Creator, willed us to discern divine truths, He would have sent down angels; therefore we utterly refuse to acknowledge your messages"
  41,15,"As to 'Ad (the 'Adites) who were unjustly extravagant in their accounts of themselves; they counselled deaf and, with inordinate self-esteem insolently said: \"Who is greater than us in power; we are the mighty ones yet\". Do they not see that Allah Who created them is infinitely greater in power and far mightier than they are and they continued to reject Our revelations"
  41,16,"And so We drove against them, on some unlucky and miserable days, a fiercely cold wind swallowing the ground with fierceness and rage, vehement, merciless, roaring for vengeance, avenging wrong and punishing crime so as to taste the suffering of disgrace and multiple humiliations in life, and worse shall be the suffering Hereafter, and no one, then, can fiord them help"
  41,17,"But as to Thamud -The Thamudites-, they preferred to close their minds' eyes than to open their hearts' ears and lift to Allah their inward sight, and so they were seized by a thunderbolt stunning them with disgrace and humiliation in requital of their deeds of iniquity"
  41,18,And We saved those whose hearts were impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and had entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah
  41,19,"The Day Allah's enemies are forced to move on in throngs toward Hell, then those in the foremost lines are stopped until those in the rear catch up"
  41,20,"And when they have all reached the intended end, there and then shall their senses: hearing, sight and touch or skin bear witness to their deeds of iniquity"
