quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  67,1,"Extolled is He for His glorious attributes, and extolled is He whose Name is blessed, for it is He Who gives and He Who takes, and in whose hands lies the sovereignty of the universe and He is Qadirun (Omnipotent) over all things"
  67,2,"It is He Who created death and life from nothingness in order to try you and to determine which of you performs the better deed, and whether his deeds agree with his words and whether his works are imprinted with wisdom and piety; He is AL-Aziz (Almighty) and AL-Ghafur (Forgiving)"
  67,3,"It is He Who created seven heavens one above another; no disproportion nor deformity can you see in the creation carried into effect by AL-Rahman, and so direct your vision toward it again and see if you can find a defect or a flaw"
  67,4,"Then again direct your intellectual eye and fix your attention on it, and you will find that vision has deposed your intellect"
  67,5,"And We decorated the lowermost heaven with lamps (or heavenly bodies), some of them adapted to be like weapons in pursuit of the evil ones for whom We have prepared torture in the blazes of Hell"
  67,6,"As for those who denied their Creator, there awaits them the punishment in Hell. How evil, painful and disastrous is the end for which they are destined"
  67,7,When cast therein they hear it breathing vengeance with fierceness and rage
  67,8,"Almost boiling in resentment in the rage of distemper; as often as a fresh group is thrown within, its keepers ask them: \"did you not receive Messenger who was a spectacle and a warning to you all"
  67,9,"Yes indeed\", they will say, \"we had received a man who was a spectacle and a warning to us all, but we declared everything stated to be untrue. We refused to admit that Allah had ever sent down any divinely inspired message, and we thought that in their counsel there remained evident falsehood"
  67,10,"And they add, \"had we opened our hearts' ears or used our minds' eyes, we would never be among those destined to the blazes of Hell"
  67,11,"They will admit the truth of what is charged and so, away with the companions in sin, destined to the blazes of Hell"
  67,12,"But those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, their Creator, Whom they cannot apprehend by sight, shall merit forgiveness and a great reward"
