quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  39,11,"Say to them -the infidels- \"I have been commanded to worship Allah and to devote to Him alone all religious rites"
  39,12,And I have been commanded to be the first of those who conform to Islam
  39,13,"And say to them: \"I am fearful of offending Allah, my Creator, for if I were to disobey Him, heaven shall lay my transgression to my charge and requite me in Day of Judgement with the torment laid upon the damned"
  39,14,"Therefore, I say to you; \"It is only Allah that I worship and to Him do I lift my inward sight and to Him alone do I dedicate all religious rites"
  39,15,"Whereas you are free to worship whom you please or whom you choose besides Him\" And say to them: \"The big losers in Day of Judgement shall he those who had lost their own souls as well as their own people and evidently shall this be the irretrievable loss"
  39,16,"Above them shall there be layers of flames of fire hanging over them like a canopy of perpetual clouds of fire and no less shall there be underneath them. This is a picture Allah uses to caution those who worship Him, as well as those who do not, against the inevitable and He exhorts them, thus: \"O you people who should seek unto Me, keep in awe of Me and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Me"

  39,20,"But those who keep in awe of Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him are destined to take their abode in paradise in beautifully designed chambers superimposed by chambers in luxuriously built mansions beneath which rivers flow, a declaration made to them by Allah Who never breaks a promise"
  39,21,"Are you -people- not able to see that Allah is He Who sends down the rain water from the floor of the vault of heaven and directs its course through the earth to form springs and water channels and by its means He produces plants variegated or varied in colour. Later on they lose their bloom and their natural colour. then you see them turning yellow and drying up and they shrivel and decay, a process servimg as a reminder of Allah's infinite influence and Omnipotence to those who reflect"
