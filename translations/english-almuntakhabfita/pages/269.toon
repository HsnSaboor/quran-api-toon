  16,15,"And the earth He furnished with firm stays (mountains) placed in a certain setting, fixed as with an anchor to stabilize* it lest it should sway you from side to side or in all directions. And He furnished it with rivers and road-ways to use as a guide in your travels from one place to another"

  16,19,"And Allah is 'Alimun (Omniscient) of all that you converse secretly or whisper below your breath and of all that you suggest secretly to the mind, and He is well acquainted with all that the bosoms store of thoughts and feelings and with all that they forge, and He knows what you utter loudly and all that is being said"
  16,20,"And those whom they invoke besides Him are incapable of creating an entity of any kind. On the contrary, they themselves have been created"

  16,22,"In point of fact, things all around point clearly to you people that your Ilah is absolutely One Eternal Ilah. Those who deny Him simply close their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes and exercise inordinate self esteem and pride got the better of their prudence"
  16,23,"Allah is indeed fully cognizant of all that they converse secretly or whisper under their breath and of what they suggest secretly to the mind, and of all that they openly declare and of all that is being said. He detests the arrogant exercising inordinate self- esteem"
  16,24,"And when they are asked if they knew what Allah has revealed, or if they were referred to some illustration from the Quran, they dismiss it contemptuously with the remark: \"Fables of old"
  16,25,"Such is the disposition of those who shall bear their burdensome lot at Judgment and the burden of their wrongs in full, in addition to the wrongs of those unlearned whom they misled. Evil indeed is the fate of those who are burdened with wrongs and evil indeed are the wrongs they bear"
