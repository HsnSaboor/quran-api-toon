quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,"By the figs and the olives (might refer to Mt. of olives just outside the wall of AL-Quds (Jerusolem) where Isa (Jesus) was sent or to the parable of Allah's light) – see Y.Ali, note"
  95,2,"And by Mount Sinai (where, Allah declared in words His Supreme Majesty to Mussa (Moses)"
  95,3,"And by this town -Macca-, the haven which confers security (where you Muhammad were chosen for the final mission)"
  95,4,We created man in the best of shape and form and distinctly upright
  95,5,Then We abased the proud to an inhabitant of the realm of Hell in requital of his ill-deeds
  95,6,But not those who believed with hearts impressed with religious and spiritual virtues and deeds of wisdom and piety; these will have passed through nature to Eternity
  95,7,"And so, what then drives people in the light of all this to deny religion and deny judgment by Allah your Creator"
  95,8,Is Allah not the Most just of all judges Who will compensate those who were wronged in life and were oppressed and their grievances no one ever redressed
  96,1,"Read \" That is to say"

  96,9,What do you think of the one who forbids
  96,10,"A votary, against praying and against religious observances"
  96,11,Is he -the infidel- O Muhammad acting on guidance steered by divine inspiration
  96,12,Or he enjoins righteousness and piety
  96,13,Do you see that he denies the truth and rejects the path of righteousness
  96,14,Does he not know that Allah the Omnipresent sees him and every act whether in the very doing or on the point of being done
  96,15,"But no, if he does not desist We will grasp him and drag him by the forelock overhanging his forehead on a Day of unbroken gloom"
  96,16,"A forehead that is false, pretending to be a forehead of divinity"
  96,17,And then let him call his associates
  96,18,We will call the punitive angels
  96,19,"But no, do not yield to him, and bow to the ground to Allah in adoration and get closer to Him by supplication"
