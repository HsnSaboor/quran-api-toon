quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"And should We send a wind drying up moisture and depriving plants and fruits of their natural colour making it turn yellow, they would be actuated with the feeling of ingratitude and ungratefulness and turn renegades"
  30,52,"And so, you just shall not be able O Muhammad to make your voice reach the spiritually dead nor shall you be able to make it reach the worthless who counsel deaf and do not open their hearts' ears when they turn their backs"
  30,53,Nor shall you be able to guide those who lack intellectual or spiritual perception and their minds' eyes are blind nor can you extricate them or disengage out of the entangled wood of error. You will be audible only to those who acknowledge Our signs and Our divine revelations betokening Omnipotence and Authority and they have conformed to Islam
  30,54,"Allah is He Who created you and delivered you over to this world in a stage of utter weakness then from weakness to strength He evolved you, then He reversed the stage of strength to a stage of weakness and gray hair. He creates and evolves what He will and He is AL-Alim (the Omniscient), AL-Qadir (the Omnipotent)"
  30,55,"And the Day when the Final Hour has come to pass, the wicked steeped in crime shall swear they only reposed for an hour. And just as they shall make the wrong estimate of time, similarly they will have done in life, they wrongly estimate the truth and they favour declination from religion"
  30,56,"But those to whose minds was imparted divine and spiritual knowledge and in whose bosoms was implanted faith as a conviction operative on their character and will, shall express the true estimate of time, thus: \"But,\" they say to the infidels, \"you were reposed in the grave as is registered in the archetypal Book of Allah till the Day of Resurrection and this is it, the promised Day which you did not realize was the truth personified"
  30,57,There and then no excuse shall be accepted from the wrongful of actions nor shall they be reproved nor be graced now by repentance
  30,58,"We have quoted in this Quran examples of typical instances that form particular cases of principle, rule and state of things, examples illustrating qualities and signal instances of punishment, action or conduct inducing imitation, examples discoursed in parables of persons whose fate serves as a deterrent., Yet if you should present them with divine signs emblematic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, the infidels label them fictitious, worthless and vain"
  30,59,Thus does Allah imprint an objectionable disposition on the hearts of those who do not realize the object of thought nor do they bring it vividly and clearly before their minds
  30,60,"Therefore, be patient O Muhammad and be unwearied in the face of difficulties and hindrances, and quietly await the course of events; the promise of Allah is the truth personified. Let not their disdainful attitude and their unsettled allegiance and belief influence your firm mind and your firm thoughts nor should you let them disturb or discompose your peace of mind"
