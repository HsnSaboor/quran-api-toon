quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  97,1,We revealed it - the Quran - commencing at the highest esteemable Night (in the month of Ramadan -the month of fasting)
  97,2,And you just do not know the meritorious standing of this Night of highest esteem
  97,3,"Deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety (like supplication, benevolence, pondering, acquirement of knowledge, at that night) merit a reward outweighing the reward due for like deeds accomplished for one thousand months"
  97,4,"There, descend the angles and the Spirit Jibril (Gabriel) to discharge the duties ordained by Allah, the Supreme"
  97,5,Peace and blessings prevail until the break of dawn
  98,1,Neither the unbelievers among Ahl AL-Kitab nor the idolaters were going to change their position until they have received clear divine evidence
  98,2,"Through A Messenger sent by Allah to read to them Scriptures of purity, quality and magnificence"
  98,3,With divine texts representing Allah's authoritative precepts featuring His words carrying greatest significance
  98,4,But Ahl AL-Kitab only became divided after they had received this clear divine evidence
  98,5,"Yet they have been commanded to worship no one but Allah and Him alone to revere, and to be true exclusively to the Faith and renounce idolatry, to impel themselves to freedom from dissimulation and to be sincere and to observe prayers and pay alms- Such is the religion approved by Allah and its path leads mankind to wisdom and piety, and induces them to discharge the duties naturally owed to Him"
  98,6,The unbelievers among Ahl AL-Kitab and the idolaters are indeed the eternal dwellers of Hell; they are the worst among Allah's intellectual beings
  98,7,But those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety are the best of the intellectual beings
