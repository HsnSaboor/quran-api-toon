quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  43,34,And homes sparkling with silver doors and lounges of silver whereupon they recline and rest with un searching and restful spirit
  43,35,"(And to round this off,) We would provide them with all sorts of adornments all of which are simply ephemeral enjoyments of this life, whereas the beautitude of the Hereafter in heaven's realm has Allah, your Creator, reserved for those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him"
  43,36,"But he who blinds himself to Allah AL-Rahman's -enlightenments and renders himself insensible of Him and of His authority, We will bind to a devil who will follow him like his shadow and give him evil counsel"
  43,37,Such companionship of evil ones as fitted to destruction will blind those insensible of AL-Rahman of the path of righteousness and make them think they are guided into all truth
  43,38,"Until the Day comes and he is in Our August presence; pained at heart, he will then say to that evil companion: \"I wish I had kept my distance and were as distant from you as the two solstices are from each other; how evil you were for a companion"
  43,39,"But this Day, they arc told, \"no one can afford you help nor can he set you free; you have wronged yourselves and now both of you shall share the condign punishment"
  43,40,"But do you think O Muhammad you will be able to make the worthless who counsels deaf open his heart's ears, or the one who lacks intellectual or spiritual perception open his mind's eyes, or that you can guide such persons as have justly been destined to err and stray from the path of righteousness"
  43,41,"Therefore, O Muhammad, should We take you away by death before you witness the promised punishment, rest assured that We, will take just vengeance on them"
  43,42,"Or if We do not take you away, then We will show you the retributive punishment of which promise was made; indeed We are able to overpower them and reduce them into a useless form"
  43,43,Therefore keep your hold O Muhammad on all that has been inspired to you and cling to the Quran; you are indeed on the path of righteousness
  43,44,For the Quran is an authoritative counsel to you and a discourse of Practical Divinity to your people and there shall come the Day when all of you will be called to account
  43,45,"And you just test critically the precepts of those whom We had sent before you, to see if We had ordained reverence and veneration to be paid to a being, or a power, or a deity besides Allah AL-Rahman"
  43,46,"(To this effect I may example My Omnipotence and Authority by a brief account of Pharaoh and his people in whose hearts reigned vices and follies.) We sent to them Mussa (Moses) and We equipped him with signs serving to demonstrate divine power and authority, and there he said to them: \"I am the Messenger of Allah, the Creator of the universe and of all beings"
  43,47,"But when he presented them with Our signs and displayed to them acts of a miraculous nature, they laughed them to scorn"
