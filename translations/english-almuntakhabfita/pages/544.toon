quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  58,12,"O you whose hearts have been touched with the Divine hand: when you wish to take counsel with the Messenger, let the occasion be preceded by an act of charity; this is commendable in you and fits you so purified to receive Allah's blessings but if you do not have the means; Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun"
  58,13,"How is it that back you recoiled, afraid of the acts of charity incumbent: on you before you took counsel with the Messenger!

But then, you must observe your prayers and give the alms and obey Allah and His Messenger; Allah is well acquainted with all that you do"

  58,19,AL-Shaytan got the better of them and made them fail to recall Allah to mind. These are members of the Satanic party united in maintaining an evil cause and defiant impiety. Indeed the partisans of AL-Shaytan shall incur privation and shall suffer loss
  58,20,"Those who challenge Allah and His Messenger and oppose the word of Allah and maintain their position as antagonists and adversaries, shall be incensed by multiplied wrongs and humiliations"
  58,21,"An ordinance set by Allah and a dictum He pronounced authoritatively: \" I- Allah-along with My Messengers shall be emblematic of the final victory of all truth\". Great is truth and it shall prevail; Allah is Qawiyun (Omnipotent) and Azizun"
