quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,75,"And if We had extended to them Our mercy and blessings and delivered them from what was burdensome and exhaustive to their minds they would have sunk under the vexations of their minds, plunged into the abyss of wickedness and carried their transgression to excess"
  23,76,"In fact, We formerly inflicted them with punishment and penalized them for disobedience and transgression that they may hopefully repent. But they never submitted nor humbled themselves to Allah, their Creator, nor did they entreat Him for mercy nor did they entreat of Him what He would have mercifully given"
  23,77,They persisted in wrong -doing until We closed the gate of mercy in their faces and opened the gate of torture and put them to torment (that they may be brought back to their senses) But to the contrary. they only nursed despair which led to recklessness and to heedlessness arising from despair
  23,78,"But Allah is He Who blessed you, people with the faculties of hearing and sight -faculties divine- and He implanted in you the seat of feeling, understanding and thought. Yet how little you render thanks or express gratitude in acknowledgement of His favours"
  23,79,And He is it Who established you on earth and made you increase in number by natural generation and in the end shall all of you be thronged before Him
  23,80,And it is He who gives life and causes animate existence and it is He Who occasions the moment of death and deprives of animate existence. And to Him is related the natural phenomenon of the variations in duration and the constant alternation and succession symbolic of the night and the day and their contingent physical phenomena. Will you not therefore think in a sensible manner and employ the faculty of reason in forming conclusions
  23,81,No. they express their thoughts in words identical with those uttered by their ancestors
  23,82,"They say: \"is it at all conceivable that when we die and be reduced to dust and bones we could be resurrected and restored to life"
  23,83,"We had been promised that before,\" they add, \"and so had been our fathers. We think this is nothing but fables of old"
  23,84,"Ask them O Muhammad: \"To whom belong the earth and all the animate and the inanimate created beings thereon! Tell me if you know"
  23,85,"Ironically, they will say: \"To Allah\", then say to them: \"Can you then not reflect"
  23,86,"Ask them: \"Who is the Ilah and Creator of the seven heavens and the Sovereign Who occupies the Supreme Throne"
  23,87,"Again they will say: \"Allah\", then say to them; \"Will you not then entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him"
  23,88,"Ask them: \"Who is He Who has the griping hands of the law of nature and the controlling power over the universe and protects the whole and all in all but needs no protection!\" Tell me if you know"
  23,89,"Again they will say: \"Allah,\" then say to them: \" then how can you be befooled so as to cause what is false to be accepted as true"
