quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  39,57,"Or it would say \"Had Allah guided me to His path I would have been among those who revered Him and entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Him"
  39,58,"Or it might say when faced with the torment laid upon the damned: \"If only I could be given the chance to relive my life again down below so that I prostrate my reason to divine revelation and be among those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence and imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety"
  39,59,"Such person shall be told: But there came to you My revelations which were related to you by My Messengers and My signs evincing both My Omnipotence and My divine nature, you rejected them and regarded them as the synonym for falsehood and your pride got the better of your prudence, you displayed inordinate self- esteem and were a disobedient rebel"
  39,60,And in Day of Judgement you shall see the faces of those who related falsehood to Allah how they will assume blackness expressive of the terror falling upon them. Is there not enough room in Hell to accommodate all those extravagant in their accounts of themselves and addicted to inordinate self- esteem
  39,61,Allah shall save those in whose hearts reigned dread mingled with veneration and deliver them to safety for their merit and never shall they come to grief
  39,62,"Allah is He Who created every entity existing individually in fact or in idea and that which is or may be in any way an object of perception, knowledge or thought and He is the Tutelary Guardian of the whole and of all in all"
  39,63,"To Him is attributed the authority and control over the known and the unknown and the mysterious schemes and systems which hold and structure together in harmonic relations and all that exists in the heavens and on earth. And He has the keys serving to open up, disclose and explain the unknown, the mysterious and the obscure. And those who denied Allah's signs and revelations shall occasion the eternal damnation; these are they who shall suffer the heaviest losses"
  39,64,"Say to them -the infidels- O Muhammad: Do you enjoin me -you people- who are destitute of knowledge and whose ignorance and irreverence have reached up into heaven, to worship anyone other than Allah the Creator of the universe"
  39,65,"We have actuated you O Muhammad as We actuated those Messengers sent before you with the feeling of caution against incorporating with Allah other deities, for if you do you will be denied the prerogative of Prophethood besides the loss you will incur and your hopes will be doomed to disappointment and your deeds to worthlessness"
  39,66,Do not pay attention to the infidels' irreverent exhortation. It is only Allah Whom you are enjoined to worship and be among those who impel themselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness
  39,67,And they* have not credited Allah with the attributes asserted as His own and they fail to ponder His marvels crediting His Omnipotence. which they shall realize in Day of Judgement. The earth with all its contents shall be under His command and His control as though it were an object firmly grasped with the fist and the heavens folded in His right hand. Praise be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. He is infinitely beyond all those they incorporate with Him
