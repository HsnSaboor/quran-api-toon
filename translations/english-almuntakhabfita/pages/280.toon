quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,111,The Day shall come when each soul pleads on behalf of itself and is requited with what is commensurate with its deeds and never shall they be wronged
  16,112,"Allah represents the fate of those who rebelled against His law by means of a parable of the town in which His grace abounded in security and peace of mind and in rich supplies of provisions from every direction. But instead of content living ever in thankful hearts, its heart beat rebellious to its own resolves and was rendered ungrateful to Allah and disobedient to His laws. By consequence He incensed it by humiliation and vested it with hunger and fear devolving upon it in requital of what its peoples' souls had impelled them to do"
  16,113,"A Messenger who evolved in their midst was sent to them with the spirit of truth guiding into all truth, but they denied Our message and accused him of falsehood. In consequence, they came within the measure of Our wrath and were made to suffer for their perpetual iniquities"
  16,114,"These were people who refused to acknowledge the true source of the bounty. Therefore, eat O you Muslims of what We provisioned you; it is all replete with choice of all delight and enjoy all that is pure lawful, wholesome and not forbidden, and be thankful to Allah for His grace"
  16,115,"He only forbids you to eat the flesh of a dead beast and blood, the flesh of swine and the flesh of a beast slaughtered under the invocation of a- name other than that of Allah. But under compelling circumstances and not through willful disobedience and transgression shall Allah admit of relaxation that no sin is incurred; Allah is indeed Ghafurun and Rahimun"
  16,116,"Do not give a speaking tongue to falsehood at the grossness of which common sense revolts. You create taboos for yourselves out of superstition and designate this as lawful and that as forbidden, wherefore you assert what is false and ascribe it to Allah. Those who relate falsehood to Allah or wittingly endeavour by falsification of words to make things seem divine which are not, shall never be graced with prosperity from heaven, nor with success"
  16,117,"They derive pleasure and satisfaction from their falsehood but the pleasure it affords them is of short duration, then comes the encounter with the torment laid upon the damned"
  16,118,"As to the Jews, We forbade them -for their iniquities- the things We have already mentioned to you O Muhammad earlier* We never wronged them but it was they who always wronged themselves"
