quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  36,28,We did not follow this incident by sending down a host from heaven against his people nor was it necessary to mobilize Our angels
  36,29,All it took was a single direful cry from heaven’s realm that stirred up a merciless blast extinguishing them and blotting them out of existence
  36,30,"A great pity upon intellectual animate beings and servants! No Messenger do they receive as an envoy of Allah but they bombard him with foul epithets, mock him and laugh him to scorn"
  36,31,"Do they not perceive by sight, apprehend by thought and learn by reading how many generations who existed before them We have destroyed and they had gone whence they shall not return"
  36,32,And that they together with their predecessors and their predominant partners and those they incorporated with Allah shall be brought back to Us and be gathered for Judgement
  36,33,"A blessing is being extended to them to contemplate, an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace: \"the dead land which We revive and from its soil We cause grain to spring out for them to eat"
  36,34,And We furnished the land out with orchards of date-palms and vines and gave vent to affluence of flowing springs
  36,35,"So that they eat of their flowers when they come to be fruits and grow ripe. It Is all replete with choice of all delights. And none of these natural products was nor will it be of their own making or their handiwork All natural objects, animal, vegetable and mineral are Allah’s handiwork. And so, will they not impel themselves with the feeling of gratitude"
  36,36,Glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes Who created all the sexual pairs of such things as the earth produces and of themselves – mankind – and of what they do not know – and yet to know and of what is beyond their mental perception and recognition
  36,37,"Another outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace. is the night which We strip of daylight and there, they are driven into darkness"
  36,38,"And the sun runs its course and describes its orbit, sited in a settled position, belonging, as determined by AL-Aziz, AL-'Alim"
  36,39,And for the moon We have determined mansions or divisions of the ecliptic which it occupies on 28 successive days and there it falls in a swoon and be like a shriveled and withered date-stalk
  36,40,The sun ought not gain impetus more than the limit designated so that it does not catch up the moon or overtake it in motion nor does the night outrun the day and each describes its own orbit
