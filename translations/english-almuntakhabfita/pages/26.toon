quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,170,"And when the unbelievers are told to recognize Allah’s revelations consenting to them, they say: \"We only lean on our fathers system of faith and worship.\" But how will it be if their fathers lacked sound Judgement in choosing means and ends and miss the path of righteousness"
  2,171,"Their negative response to the Prophet fits exactly the example of the cattle’s response to the herdsman urging them forward: either of them can hear only the utterance but none of them can intelligently distinguish between shades of meaning nor perceive value differences; deaf, dumb and blind, they cannot claim the discourse with their intellect"
  2,172,"O you who believe with faithful hearts: eat the worthy foods, We provisioned you, and impel yourselves to gratitude to Allah, if indeed it is He Whom you worship"
  2,173,"He only forbids you to eat the flesh of a dead beast, and blood, the flesh of swine and the flesh of a beast slaughtered under the invocation of a name other than Allah’s. But under compelling circumstances, not through wilful disobedience and transgression, shall Allah relax the status of a sin incurred; Allah is indeed Ghafurun (Forgiving),and Rahimun"
  2,174,"Those who keep others from the knowledge of Allah’s clear revelations in AL-Tawrah and exchange the truth for the worthless vanity of the ephemeral world, simply consume nothing but fire in their bellies. Allah shall ignore them in Day of Judgement, He shall not absolve them from guilt nor from notorious crimes and they shall be put to torment"
  2,175,"These are the ones who have been steered by false beliefs and exchanged Providence's guidance to the path of righteousness for the perplexed path in a maze, and forgiveness and mercy for torment and torture; how persistent they are in their struggle to cast themselves to Hell"
  2,176,"Such a destiny they incurred is simply the consequence of their negative response to the Book of virtues Allah revealed in truth and sincerity, and those who disputed its precepts have set themselves at variance, unable to mend this discord"
