  4,163,"We have inspired to you O Muhammad a Book and a divine message as We inspired to Nuh (Noah) and to the prophets who followed. And We inspired divine messages to Ibrahim and Ismail (Ishmael), to Ishaq (Isaac) and Ya'qub (Jacob) and to the tribes of his twelve sons, to Isa and Ayub (Job), to Yunus (Jonas) and Harun (Aaron) and to Sulayman. And to Dawud We imparted the Psalms"
  4,164,And We inspired divine messages to Messengers whom We have narrated to you before and to others whom We did not narrate to you. And to Mussa did Allah speak as He exposed Himself to his - mental view and to him He declared the divine message in words
  4,165,Such Messengers were sent as spectacles and warnings so that people shall have no excuse nor can they hold a plea against Allah in mitigation of censure after they had been warned by Allah's Messengers. And Allah has always been Azizun and Hakimun
  4,166,"But Allah is a witness of all that He has revealed to you O Muhammad and with it He has been associated. He sent it down by His authority and to this effect do the angels bear witness, and enough is Allah Himself to be the witness"
  4,167,"Indeed, those who denied Allah and stood in the way to prevent Allah's spirit of truth from guiding people into all truth have been led by the nose into the depth of the maze of error"

  4,169,But only to the path which leads directly to Hell wherein they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering. And this is indeed quite easy for Allah to bring into effect
  4,170,"O you people: the Messenger of Allah has come to you with the divine message of the truth authorized by Allah, therefore, you had better conform to Allah's system of faith and worship. And if you should deny Allah and the mission of His Messenger, then you must realize that to Allah belong all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, and Allah has always been 'Alimun, and Hakimun"
