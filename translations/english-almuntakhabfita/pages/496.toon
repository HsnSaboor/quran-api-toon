quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  44,1,"(Ha), M. (Meem) the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated"
  44,2,And by the Book which is the spirit of truth that guides people into all truth
  44,3,"The Book which We began revealing at a blessed and a highly esteemed Night, it is incumbent on Us to send a Messenger as a spectacle and a warning and entrust to him an authoritative Book"
  44,4,"A night in which every affair proceeding from Him, the Absolute source of wisdom, is disposed of in the manner imparting knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light and displaying Allah's Omnipotence and Authority"
  44,5,An ordinance set forth by Us that We send upon man Our high behests through Messengers who would illuminate the souls by divine truth
  44,6,"An act of mercy vouchsafed by Allah, your Creator, to His Creatures. He is indeed AL-Sami' (with unlimited audition), AL-Alim (the Omniscient)"
  44,7,"The Creator of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, a fact acknowledged by you people if your hearts have been touched with the divine hand"
  44,8,"There is no Ilah but He. He gives life and inspirits the property of animate existence and He occasions death and deprives of animate existence. He is Allah, your Creator, and the Creator of your forefathers"
  44,9,"Yet they are objectively uncertain of the plain truth and they give occasion to uncertainty, and they follow that emotion which they think would help them attain the object from which pleasure and satisfaction are expected"
  44,10,You just wait the course of events O Muhammad; there comes a Day when the heavens shall stir smoke-like dust and things end into smoke
  44,11,There and then shall your people -the Quraishites- smother out of a small danger into a great one by reason whereof ensues a great famine and they will be reduced to the painful extremities of hunger and the hungry flame devours the silent dead
  44,12,"Thence they shall plead with Allah for alleviating their distress: \" O Allah, our Creator \", they shall say: \"deliver us from what is burdensome and exhausting to the mind and we will submit and believe with hearts reflecting religious and spiritual virtues"
  44,13,But in what way and by what means will they be brought to their senses and keep their promise of submitting to Our Authority with hearts reflecting religious and spiritual virtues once they have been delivered from distress. They have denied Our Messenger who brought them the spirit of truth guiding people into all truth
  44,14,"And they turned a deaf ear and refused to listen and they turned their backs upon him, accusing him at one time of \"being taught by others \" and at another time \"a demoniac, possessed by an evil spirit"
  44,15,"But We will, for a while, allow you people to receive Our efficacious grace effecting the end for which it is given. We will help you get over your misfortune, albeit We know that you will return thereafter to the same subject of thought and to your former disposition. You will hug your old irreverent conviction to your hearts and consequently fall from grace"
  44,16,"There shall come the Day O Muhammad when We strike the blow that is severe, shocking, disastrous and destructive punishing wrong and avenging crime; the great instance of Our vindictive punishment. Indeed, We will take just vengeance on those wretches who had miss-spent life befooling the minds so as to cause what is false to be accepted as true"
  44,17,And long before them -the Quraishites- We had tested the people of Pharaoh. There came to them a noble Messenger -Mussa (Moses)- inviting them graciously to do what was agreeable and he presented them with inducements
  44,18,"(Inducements) to open their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes and listen to his religious and moral discourse. He said to them: \"O you servants of Allah; you had better respond favourably to the spirit of truth guiding people into all truth; I come to you with a message which Allah has entrusted to me and in sincerity and honour do I relate it to you"
