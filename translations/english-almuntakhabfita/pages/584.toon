quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,"When Allah, his Creator, called him while he was in the sacred valley of Tuwa"
  79,17,"Go to Pharaoh\", Allah said, \"for he has gone beyond all limits and all bounds he transgressed"
  79,18,"Say to him: \"Would you like to follow a path that leads you to righteousness and purity"
  79,19,"I will guide you to the path of Allah your Creator, and thus you will find your innermost thoughts and being have become sensible of Him and your secret feelings will urge you to pay your duty to Him"
  79,20,"Then Mussa, showed him the great act featuring Allah's Omnipotence and Authority"
  79,21,But Pharaoh refused to admit the truth and favoured disobedience
  79,22,He turned his back to contend the truth with falsehood
  79,23,He thronged the place with an audience and made a proclamation to satisfy his day dream
  79,24,"He said: \"I am your lord supreme"
  79,25,"But Allah punished him in requital as a caution against further transgression and made of him an example in this world, and worse shall his punishment be in Day of Judgement and adjudication"
  79,26,"Indeed, in this event there is an instructive example to those who fear Allah and dread His indignation"
  79,27,"Are you people the more difficult to create, or the heaven which He constructed"
  79,28,He lifted it up so high and its vast dimensions did He perfect and with celestial bodies did He complete it and its realms did He actuate
  79,29,Its night did He darken and the day did He pervade with light and illuminate
  79,30,and the earth did He prepare for life at a later date
  79,31,He exteriorized its water and out of it did He spring its vegetation
  79,32,and the mountains He set and anchored for stabilization
  79,33,All being instrumental in supplying provisions for you and for your cattle
  79,34,Then when the calamitous eventful event comes to pass
  79,35,Man will then remember all he did
  79,36,and Hell is brought in view for all to see
  79,37,Then he who had transgressed
  79,38,and chose to give himself to the life of this world and its vanities
  79,39,"Hell, for him, is the abode"
  79,40,"But he who feared the moment of audience of his Creator and endeavoured to make his pious principles and his words together accord, and restrained himself from vanities and discord"
  79,41,"Paradise, for him, is certainly the abode"
  79,42,They ask you O Muhammad as to when is the time of this proclaimed Hour
  79,43,But how could you satisfy their query when you yourself do not know
  79,44,"It is only with Allah your Creator, that the knowledge of the appointed time rests"
  79,45,You are only there as a spectacle and a warning to him who fears it and on the wings of righteousness he rode sublime
  79,46,"On the day they eye-witness the Event, it appears to them in retrospect as if it were only an afternoon or a forenoon that they actually spent"
