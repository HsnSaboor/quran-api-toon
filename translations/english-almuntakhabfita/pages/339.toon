quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  22,56,There and then shall the Sovereign Authority and the right of controlling be exclusively that of Allah Who sits in judgement to confer the beatitude and the gardens of bliss on those whose hearts were imprinted with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety
  22,57,And to requite the infidels who defiantly rejected Allah's divine and authoritative signs with the torment that is laid upon the damned
  22,58,"And those who quit their homes and their towns to settle where they could best serve Allah's purpose and strive in His cause whether killed in action or died of natural causes shall be honoured. Allah shall make His grace abound in them, for He is indeed the best Purveyor of all the material necessities and of all the spiritual attributes"
  22,59,He shall admit them into favour and grant them an honourable entry actuating them with the feeling of pleasure and satisfaction; Allah is indeed 'Alimun and Halimun (Forbearing) toward His creatures
  22,60,"And he who makes requital or retaliation on a person for an injury he has received shall -if he must- repay only in kind and in extent. Should he -the plaintiff- be offended further by the offender, then shall Allah help him -the former- against the aggressor -the latter- and give him victory over him; Allah is indeed ever 'Afuwun (Indulgent), and Ghafurun (Forgiving)"
  22,61,"This is it, for Allah Who causes the night to lose its character and identity by absorption into the day and causes the day to lose its character and identity by absorption into the night is indeed able to keep His promise and His support to whom He will. And Allah is indeed Sami'un (Ominipresent) with unlimited audition and Bassirun (He clearly sees all things)"
  22,62,"Wherefore Allah is truth personified and any other object of worship they invoke besides Him is simply falsehood itself. Allah is indeed the Unique Whose attributes belong to the highest regions of thought and reality, the Unique Who is eminently entitled to the designation: \"The Supreme"
  22,63,Do you not see that Allah sends down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain water and makes it instrumental in springing up vegetation and rendering the land verdant! Allah is indeed Latifun (Gracious). He gives His servants an understanding heart. He is Khabirun (Omniscient)
  22,64,"To Him belong all that is in the heavens arid all that is on earth and Allah is indeed Ghaniyun (Independent), (Absolute) and Hamidun (His grace abounds in the universe, and he is worthy of all praise)"
