quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  20,77,"Meanwhile, We inspired Mussa to conduct My servants by night to the sea and to strike for them a dry path across and We assured him, thus: \"You shall not be overtaken by Pharaoh and his people. They shall not catch up with you nor should you fear them"
  20,78,"Pharaoh in command of his troops went in pursuit of Mussa and his people whom he considered as enemies to the community of nature, but they were overwhelmed with the sea water which overpowered them"
  20,79,"In effect what Pharaoh actually did was that he fooled his people, led them astray and never did he really guide them to a path of righteousness"
  20,80,"O Children of Israel: We delivered you from your enemy and We ordained for you the divine assignation -through Mussa on the right side of Mount Sinai to receive the commandments- and We provisioned you with Al Manna, the continual dew of the blessed victuals, and with the Quails"

  20,87,"We did not break our promise of our own accord,\" they said, \"but we were made to carry loads of ornaments -of Egyptian women- which we thought portend evil and We threw them in the fire to get rid of them and so did Samiri"
