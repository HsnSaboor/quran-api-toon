quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,65,"Do you not see that Allah reduced for you al! that is on earth to a state of subservienacy, and the ships move on the surface of the sea by His invisible acting force producing their buoyance and their motion ! And tIe sustains and support the heavens -their contents- and keeps them from falling on the earth unless it be permitted by Him -meteorites, shooting stars, fire balls-.

They are almost ready to set upon with hostile action and words to injure and overthrow those who recite to them Our revelations, Say to them O Muhammad: -If these divine revelations are distasteful to you- shall I tell you of what shall be far worse and more distasteful to you ! it is Hell which Allah has promised to those infidels who denied Him, and how evil is the end for which they are destined"
