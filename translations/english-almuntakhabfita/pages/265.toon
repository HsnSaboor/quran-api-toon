quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  15,52,"They made entry into his home and greeted him with the expression of good will, \"Peace\", he recoiled back afraid of them -due to their unusual behaviour"
  15,53,"Do not be afraid\". They said, \" we have some news to break to you. We are here to announce to you the procreation of a son Ishaq (Isaac) who shall be imbued with wisdom and divine know ledge"
  15,54,"How can you\", said Ibrahim, \"intimate to me such news when I have been carried through the stealing steps of age to advanced life! Is this an object of a joke that you intimate to me"
  15,55,"Never\", they said, \"but we have intimated to you the truth and therefore do not entertain the idea that the thing which seems hopeless makes you despair of Allah's mercy"
  15,56,"Who would despair of Allah's mercy\", Ibrahim said, \" but those who are lost in the maze of error"
  15,57,"And now\", Ibrahim said, \"what is the errand on which you Messengers have come"
  15,58,"We have been sent\", the Messengers said, \"to a sinful people who grow daily more and more wicked"
  15,59,But not the family of Lut (Lot) all of whom will we save
  15,60,Excepting his wife whom we have determined that she be among those who shall be left behind to share their destiny
  15,61,And when the Messengers presented themselves to Lut
  15,62,"He said to them: \"You are strangers who are foreign to me"
  15,63,"But\", said the Messengers, \"we have brought you the answer to the problem of those who doubted your mission and denied your divine message"
  15,64,And we have brought you the truth and we conduct ourselves in accordance with the divine standard
  15,65,"You just escort your family\", they said, \"and take them out of this town at the dead hours of the night hanging on their rear and none of you shall look in the direction from which you are going and keep going to where you are commanded"
  15,66,"And We informed him of this decree, thus: \"These wicked people shall be uprooted by morning"
  15,67,"In the interim, there came the city dwellers displaying their gasp of pleasure and joyous delight at the thought of the presence of young men"
  15,68,"These are my guests\", said Lut, \"I beg of you not to bring shame or discredit upon me"
  15,69,And fear Allah and do not disgrace me
  15,70,"Did we not forbid you\", they said \"to entertain people in your house and defend your principles"
