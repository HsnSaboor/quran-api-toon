quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  19,65,"Allah is the Creator of the heavens and the earth and of all that is between, therefore, worship Him and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, and exercise patience in religious observance and in face of difficulties and hindrances. Think but this: do you know of any who shares His divine nature and His divine attributes"
  19,66,"Yet man says to himself: \"Would I be resurrected and be restored to life after I have long been dead"
  19,67,Does man not remember that We created him in the beginning when he was absolutely nothing and nonexistent
  19,68,"By Allah, your Creator, We will throng them together with those who played the devil and with those with characteristics befitting AL-Shaytan and throng them all on their knees girdling round Hell"
  19,69,Then We will haul up from every sect those who were disobedient and rebellious against AL-Rahman the most
  19,70,We do know quite well the most deserving among the wide circle of the all to the torment to be laid upon the damned in Hell
  19,71,"None of you people but shall go by it -the confines of Hell-, an inevitable event that is promised by Allah and incumbent upon Him and no one is destined to escape it"
  19,72,"There, will We lead safely and deliver those who entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and leave to it down on their knees the wrongful of actions whom it asserts as her own"
  19,73,"When Our revelations are recited to them, revelations distinctly expressing all that is meant leaving nothing merely implied, they exclaim: \"which of the two parties\" they ask, \"holds a high position in the social scale and status and in society, the nobility who do not follow Muhammad or the no-bodies who follow him"
  19,74,"They fail to realize how countless were the generations We destroyed, generations who came to this world before them and were more affluent and enjoyed more splendour"
  19,75,"Say to them -The infidels- O Muhammad \"Those who are satisfied with their state of loss in the maze of error shall experience more of it. Allah shall give them enough rope to allow them free scope of action to commit themselves until the encounter with the promised punishment either at the hands of the Muslims here below or in Day hi Judgement Hereafter. There and then, shall they realize who are in the most grievous and dreaded state and have the lesser and weaker forces"
  19,76,But those who chose the path of righteousness and Providence their guide shall Allah make circumstances favourable to them to think better and do better wherefore the everlasting deeds of wisdom and piety are esteemed by Allah as most rewarding and of note and so much consequence
