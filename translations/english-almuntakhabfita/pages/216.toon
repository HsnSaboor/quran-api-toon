quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,62,"Indeed, those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand who chose to be under Allah's tutelage are they who are safe and secure; they have no ground for alarm nor shall fear or dread fall upon them, nor shall they come to grief"
  10,63,They have faithfully recognized Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Him
  10,64,"The news of joyful events are hereby announced to them in this world and in the world-to-come. The words uttered by Allah are not alterable, meaning that divine assurance of present and future good or blessing is irrevocable and this is indeed triumph supreme"
  10,65,"Therefore, let not their- the infidels' - vain and unreasonable discourse O Muhammad grieve you at heart. Might, honour and Omnipotence are all asserted as Allah's own; He is Sami'un (Omnipresent with unlimited audition) and 'Alimun"
  10,66,"Indeed, all that exists in the heavens and on earth and all creatures in the heavens and on earth belong to Allah alone. Those infidels who incorporate with Him other deities pervert the facts; they only follow the false suppositions and the incitement arising from the state of their minds and feelings; they simply lie and indeed they lie in their teeth"
  10,67,"He -Allah- is it Who designated for you a period of darkness -the night-* to take your natural repose and recuperate, and a period filled with -light the day- to have clear perception of things and acquire experience of the activities of human existence. These are phenomena emblematic indeed of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, phenomena that are appreciated and faithfully recognized by people who bow down their ears to the truth"
  10,68,"They -The infidels- insolently said: Allah has taken up a son; glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes; He is infinitely Independent and Absolute. To Him alone belong all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth. Do you people have proof or solid information or a valid indication to evidence your ugly and false allegation ! Do you relate to Allah what you do not know nor able to prove"
  10,69,"Say to them -the infidels-: \"Those who charge Allah with false and malicious misrepresentation shall fare ill; they shall go farther and fare worse"
  10,70,Possessions here and all that affords pleasure shall not be enjoyed for long; life here is a scene of evanescent and fleeting glory. Then back to us they return and there and then shall We afflict them with the torment laid upon the damned who thrived on denying Allah and on disobeying His commands
