quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,40,We accept the authority of the magicians should they win and espouse their opinions and their cause
  26,41,"And when the sorcerers congregated to action they said to Pharaoh: \"Assuredly, we will be rewarded should we be the winners"
  26,42,"Yes indeed,\" Pharaoh said, \"and you shall be in a position that entitles you to be among my retinue"
  26,43,"Mussa said to the magicians, \"Cast upon the ground all that you wish to cast"
  26,44,"And as they were casting their ropes and rods, they invoked -their god- Pharaoh in supplication for aid and success. They prayed: By Pharaoh's might we will be the winners"
  26,45,"And when Mussa cast his staff, it counter-worked their ingenious expedience and swallowed all that they cast upon the ground of fraudulent devices of a mean and deceptive kind"
  26,46,"Overwhelmed with wonder, the sorcerers bowed to the ground in comely order, praise and admiration"
  26,47,"And they declared submission: \"We conform our will\", they said, \" to Allah's will and we surrender ourselves to Him, the Creator of the worlds"
  26,48,The Ilah of Mussa and Harun
  26,49,"And here said Pharaoh to them: \"Have you yielded to his claims and surrendered yourselves to his Ilah without my permission!\" \"This is indeed,\" he added, a deceitful plan designed by your master who taught you magic and you shall bear the consequences and soon come to know how heavily you shall pay for this!\" \"I will amputate your hands and your feet on opposite sides and I will have you all crucified"
  26,50,"We are not afraid of this,\" they said, \"We have enough sense to know what we are doing, we welcome your decision which shall haste us unto Allah Who might confer on us the glorious privilege of martyrdom"
  26,51,"In fact\", they added, \"our only hope is that Allah, our Creator extends His mercy to us and forgives us our sins and our sinful acts of fraudulent magic for being foremost in deviating into sense and acknowledging His supreme Sovereignty, Omnipotence and Authority"
  26,52,"Meanwhile We inspired Mussa to conduct My servants -the Israelites- by night to the sea and We said to him: \"Be sure you shall be followed"
  26,53,Pharaoh sent Messengers to all his cities to call up the people to organize themselves for the hindrance and the defeat of Mussa and his people by contrary measures
  26,54,"He said to them: \"Mussa and his people -the Israelites- are only some few contemptible body"
  26,55,And they provoked Our anger and came within the measure of Our wrath which is conducive to annihilation
  26,56,And We are all cautious and on our guard
  26,57,"Wherefore We compelled them to the natural result of tyranny, disobedience and transgression. We expelled them from the earthly paradise they once possessed and from the land of orchards and springs"
  26,58,the land of treasures and homes and accommodations so splendid
  26,59,"And so it was, and We made the land inheritable by the Children of Israel to whom We conveyed the right of the property after We drowned Pharaoh and his people"
