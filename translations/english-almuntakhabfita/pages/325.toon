quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  21,36,"And when the infidels see you O Muhammad they receive you with nothing but disdain and scorn which ride sparkling in their eyes and they say: \"Is this the one who blasphemes your gods! And when Al Rahman is mentioned, their countenances speak blasphemy against Him"
  21,37,"Man has been created with the innate propensity to be unduly hasty of spirit; I will exhibit to you My acts and My marvels serving to demonstrate divine power and authority, therefore, do not ask Me to hasten them on"
  21,38,"And yet they -the infidels- ask the Muslims: \"When shall that promised punishment come to pass if indeed you declare the truth"
  21,39,If only these infidels who deny Allah knew that there shall come a time when they shall not be able to avert the blazing fire from their faces nor from their backs nor shall they be afforded help
  21,40,"It shall surprise them. Pale and dumb, they shall stand confused and confounded unable to avert it nor shall they be granted respite"
  21,41,"Messengers who were sent before you O Muhammad were also bombarded with foul epithets, the infidels mocked them and gave them a lick with the rough side of their tongues and called them everything they could lay their tongues to. In consequence were the mockers beset on all sides by the same material and immaterial things they had turned in to ridicule"
  21,42,"Say to them: \"Who can defend you by night and/or by day from AL- Rahman if His wrath speaks thunder\". But they are unwilling to listen to divine Revelation nor to Allah's warning and they are habitually opposed to the mention of His attributes"
  21,43,"Or have they gods, besides Him, who can defend them! They -the gods- are themselves unable to hold their own nor can they defend themselves, let alone defending others should We decide that they perish"
  21,44,We granted these people together with their fathers comfort and enjoyment and all that advantaged them of Our blessings in life as long as they lived. Do they not see that We reduce their territories and straiten their outlying borders -by rapid progress of Islam-. is it then they who are the winners or the conquerors
