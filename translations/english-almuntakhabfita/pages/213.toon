quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"Say to them: \"Is there any one among your predominant partners whom -you presume to share with Allah His divine nature who can start creation from nothingness and reproduce it? Then say to them: \" Allah does start creation from nothingness and reproduces it and on the Day of Resurrection He shall create all anew, therefore, how could you be strongly deluded so as to believe a lie"
  10,35,"Say to them O Muhammad: \"Is there anyone among your predominant partners whom you presume to share with Allah His divine nature, who can guide people into all truth!\" Then say to them: Allah's spirit of truth guides to all truth, therefore, does He Who guides to all truth not merit to be followed, or he who cannot act as a guide and needs to be guided!\" \"What ails you people that you cannot apprehend mentally the difference nor arrive at a sound and correct Judgement"
  10,36,Most of them only follow the false suppositions and the incitement arising from the state of their minds and feeling. An opinion offered on insufficient presumptive evidence cannot override the truth nor overrule it; Allah is 'Alimun (Omniscient) of all that they do
  10,37,"Nor could this Quran be contrived by anyone even if he is of singular ingenuity. Its inimitability, guidance and precision betoken its divine nature and exclude all else besides Allah. It corroborates and authoritatively validates all the divine Books revealed before it in time and serves as an excellent interpretation expounding all the statutes and ordinances past and present revealed to all intelligent creatures and exacts obedience from the whole. It is undoubtedly a Revelation emphatically revealed by Allah, the Creator of the universe and of the world-to-come"
  10,38,"Or do they say: \"He Muhammad has forged it\" Say to them: \"If you do believe I did, then produce one Surah the like thereof, and call on all those besides Allah whom you can possibly engage to venture upon this undertaking if indeed you are declaring the truth"
  10,39,"The fact is that: they deny the Quran and assert that it is false without deliberating on its divine discourse and without knowledge of its precepts, nor has its interpretation been given yet. Similarly reacted their predecessors under the vexations of their minds, and you can see the fatal consequence of the wrongful of actions"
  10,40,"Nonetheless, among them are some who give credence to it and hold it as true and divine, while others do simply refuse to receive it with favour or consenting mind. But Allah, your Creator, knows best those who are characterized with prepensed malice"
  10,41,"However, if they should charge you O Muhammad with falsehood, you just say to them: \"I am responsible for my deeds and you are responsible for yours; you are innocent of my actions and I am innocent of what your minds and souls impel you to do"
  10,42,"Among them are some who listen to your discourse on practical divinity but they counsel deaf. Therefore, do you think you will be able to communicate with those whose their hearts' ears are closed and they fail to reflect"
