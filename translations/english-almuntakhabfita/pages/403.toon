quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  29,53,And they -the infidels- challenge you -O Muhammad- to hasten on the promised retributive punishment! Had it not been for a predetermined point of time set for their reckoning -to give a chance to repent- their Hereafter would have been planted in the now. But it shall overtake them unawares when least expected
  29,54,They challenge you to hasten on the retributive punishment and they do not realize that Hell besets the infidels who deny Allah on all sides
  29,55,"The Day shall come when the torment laid upon the damned hangs over their heads and is carpeted under their feet. There and then, they are told: \"Taste the fatal consequence of your deeds"
  29,56,"O you My worshippers who conformed your will to My will: \"My earth is, vast indeed -therefore you have no excuse-, worship Me and Me alone"
  29,57,Every soul shall pay its debt to nature and by consequence experience death and shall all of you be brought back to Us
  29,58,Then those who imprinted their hearts with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety shall be the recipients of Our mercy and blessings. We will accommodate them in Paradise at mansions beneath which rivers flow wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity and this is the reward of those who worked for it
  29,59,These are they who exercised patience and endured hardships and sat like patience on a monument smiling at grief and in Allah they put their trust
  29,60,"How many among Allah's created beings do not provide themselves with livelihood! Allah provides them with what is necessary for their sustenance as He does provision you -people- with victuals, eatables and drinkables, and He is AL-Sami' , and AL-Alim"
  29,61,"And if you should ask them -O Muhammad- as to who has created the heavens and the earth and reduced the sun* and the moon to a state of subservience! They will say \"Allah\", and so how could they counsel deaf to the truth"
  29,62,Allah gives livelihood generously and confers support gratuitously on whom He will of His servants and He also gives with restraint and by measure to whom He Will. He is indeed Alimun of all things
  29,63,"And if you should ask them as to who sends water from the floor of the vault of heaven and revives the earth after it has suffered death,* they will say \"Allah\". Then say to them: \"Thank Allah\" -for admitting the truth-. They do not realize that they contradict themselves because most of them do not comprehend the facts"
