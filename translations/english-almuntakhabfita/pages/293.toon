quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,105,In truth We sent down the Quran and in conformity with fact and in agreement with reality has it been revealed. We have only sent you O Muhammad as a spectacle and a warning
  17,106,A Quran that has been revealed in partible division at intervals so that you may recite it O Muhammad to the people slowly and deliberately. We revealed it in succeeding stages and each part with the others makes up the whole
  17,107,"Therefore say to them -the infidels- O Muhammad: \"Believe in it or do not give credence to it; those to whom We imparted knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light before it was revealed bow to it in reverence and submission. When it is recited to them they cast themselves down prostrate in humility and veneration"
  17,108,"And they say: \"Praise be to Allah, our Creator, and extolled are His glorious attributes. Indeed, the promise of Allah, our Creator, inevitably comes to pass and is always fulfilled"
  17,109,The Quran influences their senses and minds and excites their emotion that it prompts weeping and as they stand in awe of their Creator they prostrate themselves in profound reverence and humility
  17,110,"Say to the Pagans who reject the attribute AL- Rahman and think it is another god: Invoke Allah or invoke AL-Rahman whichever you choose, for to Him belong all the graceful Names which are the supreme appellations in which His unique qualities are ascribed. And to avoid -O Muhammad- their mockery and derision when you engage in the act of worship, you just entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah. And do not voice your prayer loudly nor pronounce it inaudibly or below your breath but hold a middle degree between the two extremes"
  17,111,"And express you gratitude to Him in words for His unipersonality and Unique divine nature, thus: \"Praise be to Allah Who did not beget nor adopt a son nor is there anyone to share His divine nature or His realm nor is He dependent upon a tutelary guardian to protect Him from harm and from humiliation and praise Him highly for His imposing Omnipotence"
  18,1,"Praise be to Allah Who sent down to His servant the Book -the Quran- well founded, constant ,resolute and did not allow therein of declension, obliquity or crookedness"
  18,2,"But orthodox, in accordance with what is divinely and authoritatively established as the truth guiding into all truth so that it strongly warns the ungodly and the impious of the torment laid upon the damned. It announces joyful tidings to those whose hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety to expect a distinguished reward"
  18,3,The reward which merits the blissful abode in the beautitude of heaven wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity
  18,4,And to give a cautionary notice against the ascription to Allah of plurality and to warn those whose hearts work iniquity not to utter grievous error against Him and irreverently say that He has begotten a son
