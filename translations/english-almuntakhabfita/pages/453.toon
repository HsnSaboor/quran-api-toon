  38,4,"Yet they -the infidels- marvel at the recognition of a man who came to them from their midst to serve as a spectacle and a warning and they refused to accept him in his capacity. Venting their hatred, they say; \"He is not only a sorcerer but also a pathological liar"
  38,5,Does He proclaim the gods to be but one god This is indeed strange
  38,6,"And the leaders of falsehood among them walked off the meeting in confusion and exhorted their adherents to remain faithful, constant and firm in fidelity to their gods. \"This movement\", they said, \"has been designed against us and a chism formed to our detriment"
  38,7,"We never heard\", they said of a like system of faith and worship being practiced by our fathers in this generation.\" \"This is indeed\", they continued, \"nothing but a made up story and a willful and fraudulent deception"

  38,14,"Each and all of them confederated their hands and their minds to oppose the Messengers and accused them of falsehood; retribution, was therefore justified"
