quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,22,"Journeying toward Madyan he said to himself: \"Perhaps Allah, my Creator will guide me out of this fearful country into the path of truth and safety"
  28,23,"And as he arrived at the spring waters of Madyan he found a large crowd of people watering their flocks. Among them he found two women trying to keep back their flocks. He asked them: \"What is your trouble?\"; \"we cannot water our flocks\", they said, \"until the shepherds have driven off their flocks and our father is quite an old man"
  28,24,"Mussa watered for them their flocks then assumed a place in the shade and prayed: \"O Allah, my Creator,\" \"with all Your grace that abounds in me I am indigent and-lonely"
  28,25,"Unexpectedly, there came back one of the two women walking with a womanly propriety of behaviour, chastity of thought, speech and conduct. She said to him: \"My father invites you to requite you for the service you rendered to us, watering our flocks\". And when he went and met with the father and told him his story, the father said to him: \"Do not be afraid, you have already gotten off safely and escaped from the people who are wrongful of actions"
  28,26,"And there, said one of the women to her father: \"Would you hire him O father, for the best you can hire is the reliable man who is rather strong and worthy of trust"
  28,27,"The father said to Mussa: \"I wish to offer you one of my daughters in matrimonial union on contrition that you serve me for eight years and should you like to add two more years to make them ten, it will be of your own accord\". \"I do not wish,\" he added, \"to make things difficult for you and you will find me, Allah willing, one of these in whose hearts reigns piety"
  28,28,"This\", he added, \"is an agreement between me and you, whichever of the two terms be fulfilled, there shall be no injustice or ill-will to me and Allah is a Witness to our binding agreement"
