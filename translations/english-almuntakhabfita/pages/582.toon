quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,what now are they asking about
  78,2,is it the great news of resurrection
  78,3,the subject of dispute between those who argue in favour and those who argue against it
  78,4,"No, but they shall soon come to know"
  78,5,"No, but indeed they shall soon come to know. Then Allah reminds them by drawing their attention to His omnipotence; He says"
  78,6,Did We not prepare the earth to be a settled habitation
  78,7,and the mountains as stays that afford stabilization
  78,8,We created you in pairs
  78,9,We made your sleep* a repose for relief and recuperation
  78,10,and the night a vestment and black was the colour chosen to absorb all light emanating from the cosmic sources of illumination
  78,11,We made the day-time luminous for activity and livelihood
  78,12,We built above you seven fortitudinous heavens vast and with endless amplitude
  78,13,We installed a lamp glowing dispensing heat and illumination
  78,14,We sent down from the rainy clouds water affluent and at times involving succession
  78,15,To bring forth therewith grains and vegetation
  78,16,and thickly foliaged orchards and gardens of delightful variation
  78,17,Indeed the Day of Judgment foreordained falls at an absolute time Predestinated
  78,18,This is the Day the trumpet is sounded and you come together in throngs embodying your souls and fully actuated
  78,19,and the heaven is opened typifying open doors for the adminission of all
  78,20,and the mountains are set in motion and into a mirage as if transmigrated
  78,21,There and then hell is made to lie in wait
  78,22,It is the destined abode of the transgressors wherein they are designated
  78,23,"Therein, they remain for ages as has been predestinated"
  78,24,They will taste no coolness for relief nor a drink to quench their thirst
  78,25,But only boiling water and their rotten discharges for doing their worst
  78,26,A requital commensurate with deeds
  78,27,They never believed they would be judged
  78,28,and Our revelations and signs they charged with falsehood and insolently did they negate
  78,29,But everything We kept on record and in a book did We incorporate
  78,30,Now taste the outcome of your deeds and plenty of the same will We increase and perpetuate
