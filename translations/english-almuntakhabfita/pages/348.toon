quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,90,But We have constantly presented to them the truth at the hands of all the Messengers but they persistently counterchange the truth with falsehood and lie in their teeth
  23,91,"Never did Allah take, adopt or beget a son nor did He share His sovereignty with any god; for, if He did, then each Allah would have had a kingdom of his own independent of the others and each would have established his own laws and made sure to exalt himself above the others. Glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. He is infinitely far beyond all that they falsely attribute to Him"
  23,92,"The Omniscient of all the unseen, the hidden and the unknown and the Omniscient of all that is perceived by sight and all that is evidently known, Praise be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. He is infinitely far beyond all those whom they incorporate with Him"
  23,93,"And pray: \"O Allah, my Creator, if You have destined me to see in my life time the scene of the devastating retributive punishment which they have been promised"
  23,94,"Then, I pray and beseech You O Allah, my Creator, not to make me a constituent part of the whole who are wrongful of actions"
  23,95,"However, We are certainly able to let you see with your own eyes O Muhammad the scene of the promised devastating retributive punishment"
  23,96,Repress your offended and wounded feelings and repel evil with what is gracious in words or in action
  23,97,"And pray: \"To You O Allah, my Creator, do I commit myself counter to the satanic instigations suggested to the mind"
  23,98,"And to You O Allah, nay Creator, do I commit myself counter to their presence near me"
  23,99,"And when any of them -these infidels- who have been promoting falsehood comes upon the encounter with death, he prays and beseeches Allah, his Creator to have him sent back to life"
  23,100,"He says: \"If given the chance\" I may be able to do all I have neglected and left undone and imprint my deeds with wisdom and piety. Never. But this is a wish he expresses in words! Once the souls have been disembodied and crossed to the other world, it is then a one - way journey with no return. Behind them there is an impassable barrier barricading the passage back until the Day of Resurrection when people are then restored to life"
  23,101,And when the trumpet is sounded in Day of Judgement no ties of kinship of any kind or degree shall be of avail in accomplishing a purpose. Ties are simply dissolved and each one is tried upon no other recommendation than the quality of his own deeds nor shall they be able to discourse on any point
  23,102,"There and then, he whose deeds of wisdom and piety surpass in weight shall he and such persons be the fortunate who shall rejoice beyond a common joy"
  23,103,And he whose inequities surpass in weight on one scale of the balance shall he and such persons be losers. Their iniquities and unjust treatment of Our revelations and signs have lost them their souls
  23,104,"Their faces shall be scorched with the Fire and their countenances shall be expressive of pain and torture and their souls shall be bewailing their misfortune, their suffering and their ill - fate and bewailing at the day that they were born"
