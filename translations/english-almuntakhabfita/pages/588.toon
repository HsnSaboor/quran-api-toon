  83,11,Who declared the Day of Judgment to be untrue and not an actuality
  83,12,No one denies it but a transgressing impudent sinner
  83,13,"Who closes his heart's ears to Our revelation when rendered to him in discourse and says: \"Tales fabled by those of old"

  83,15,There and then shall they be excluded from the joy of being sensible to their Creator’s light and glory
  83,16,That is besides suffering the blazing Hell Fire
  83,17,"There and then shall they be told: \"This is the truth which you had always denied to satisfy your vain desire"
  83,18,But the Register of the righteous points out to 'Elliyeen elation and glory
  83,19,You just do not know what 'Elliyeen is like

  83,30,When they went by them they winked to each other and treated them with ridicule
  83,31,And when they returned to their people they returned with a mouth filled with laughter in contempt
  83,32,"When they saw the believers or met with them they said: \"These are indeed the erring faction"
  83,33,As if they were sent to watch their action
  83,34,"And so, today, -Day of Judgment- the situation is being reversed; it is the turn of Allah's devotees to laugh at the infidels, scorn them and hold them in disdain"
