quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  54,7,"Incensed by humiliation reflecting their multiplied wrongs, they will emerge from the graves with downcast eyes in throngs like locusts clustering in myriads"
  54,8,"Responding to the call expeditiously and sensing, as infidels who denied Allah, what awaits them of horror and ghastly dread, they admit: \" This is indeed going to be a distressful day"
  54,9,"The people of Nuh (Noah) in earlier times refused to admit the truth of Our message, and renounced Our servant -the Messenger- and accused him of being demoniac and they gave him a lick with the rough sides of their tongues and called him everything they could lay their tongues to"
  54,10,"Nuh made devout and humble supplication to Allah praying His aid: \"My Creator\", he said, \" thus far I have been defeated, and the wickedness of my people may defeat Your cause. My Creator, this is a just cause for ground of action"
  54,11,"We opened the gates of heaven and poured down copious, impetuous and torrential rain sufficient to deluge the world"
  54,12,"And We made the earth break forth into sudden action and made the water rush violently and copiously forcing springs and passages impetuously through, and the two waters met to accord in one to occasion the event foreordained for those who were wicked"
  54,13,And We carried him Nuh on an ark constructed with planks fittest together and trusted to save him and his crew from shipwreck
  54,14,"And We kept the ark afloat by Our command, keeping an eye on it and closely observing it with Our blessings to guard them home and reward those within and punish those without"
  54,15,"And We left it as a sign serving to convey an intimation; an act of a miraculous nature serving to demonstrate Divine power and omnipotence and so, is there any who will open his heart's ears and his mind's eyes"
  54,16,And how painful was My punishment imposed on those who counselled deaf to admonition and wasted their lives and refused to acknowledge their Messenger
  54,17,"We made the Quran conducive to ease, facile in discourse, easy to remember and a guide to the path of righteousness, and so, is there any who will open his heart's ears and his mind's eyes"
  54,18,So did the people of 'Ad - the 'Adites -; they refused to admit the truth of Our message and they renounced their Messenger. How painful was My punishment on those who counselled deaf to admonition and wasted their lives and refused to acknowledge their Messenger
  54,19,"We drove against them, on an unlucky and a miserable day, a fierce cold wind swallowing the ground with fierceness and rage, vehement and merciless, roaring for punishing crime"
  54,20,"Setting people flying and springing upon the ground with violence, plucking towns out and leaving nothing standing as if they were palm- trees torn up by the roots"
  54,21,"And so, how painful was My punishment imposed on those who counselled deaf to admonition and wasted their lives and refused to acknowledge their Messenger"
  54,22,"We made the Quran conducive to ease, facile in discourse, easy to remember and a guide to the path of righteousness; and so is there any who will open his heart's ears and his mind's eyes"
  54,23,And likewise acted -the Thamudites-; they disbelieved their Messenger and they obstinately refused to listen to the warning against impending danger and misfortune
  54,24,"They said: \"Is it in conformity with correct reasoning that one human among us and of human character would be the leader to follow? \" We would be indeed at variance with what one approves or regards as right, and we would be of unsound mind"
  54,25,"Is he the one man taken by preference out of all of us who are available, to carry the divine message?\" \" Indeed he is a liar"
  54,26,But soon enough shall they know who the liar is
  54,27,"We are sending the she -camel as a trial to prove their wickedness\". \"And so keep them in view in order to observe their action, and have patience"
