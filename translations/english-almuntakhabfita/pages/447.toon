quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,25,"They are asked: \"How is it that you do not help one another Hereafter as you did her below"
  37,26,"But they are at a disadvantage in this Day of Judgement, they give themselves up into Allah's power and they resign themselves to His command"
  37,27,"They will convey their thoughts reciprocally in talk, holding discourse of the why and the wherefore and of the how and when of life and past events relative to their actions, their responses, their reactions and their fate"
  37,28,"Those who yielded to external influence will recriminate those who led them by the nose into error, they will say: \"You had always approached us from the right-hand side which we presumed to be the way of moral rightness and spiritual salvation"
  37,29,"But\", the accused will say: \"You yourselves were a people whose hearts never reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues nor were you receptive of the truth"
  37,30,Nor did we have authority over you or impose on you an edict or edicts; the fact is that you played the tyrant and were people given to transgression
  37,31,"And the word of Allah\", they Will add, \"which was predicted beforehand is being fulfilled, and now will all of us experience the taste of the punishment falling to us as our lot and making us bewail at the day we were born"
  37,32,"And they will say in addition: \"We made you depart from the path of righteousness for we ourselves were holders of mistaken and false beliefs"
  37,33,Wherefore shall all those who denied Allah and incorporated with Him other deities go shares in what falls to their lot in Day of Judgement of the torment laid upon the damned from hence forever
  37,34,For thus do We requite the sinful who grow daily more and more wicked
  37,35,"When they were told in life: \"There is no supreme being but Allah\", they responded with extravagance in their accounts of themselves and displayed inordinate self-esteem"
  37,36,"And they expressed their thoughts in words, thus: \"shall we\" they said, \"forsake our gods on account of what has been said by whom we hold certainly a demoniac"
  37,37,"When to the contrary, he presented to them the spirit of truth that guides into all truth, confirming the divine message related to the people by the Messengers who were sent before him"
  37,38,"Then they, will be told: You -infidels- shall certainly experience the taste of the torment laid upon the damned"
  37,39,And you shall be requited with what is commensurate with your deeds
  37,40,But excluded from punishment in the abysm of Hell shall be those who were faithful to Allah and sincerely conformed to His system of faith and worship
  37,41,Such persons shall be provisioned with what Allah has mercifully reserved for them of expected grace and of what is replete with choice of all delights
  37,42,"They are presented with fruits, and they will be bearing their honours thick upon them and treated with honour"
  37,43,In the beatitude of heaven in the gardens of supreme blessedness and happiness
  37,44,Seated on thrones of dignity facing each other
  37,45,Attended upon and served with a drink in the cup of Joy procured from a spring flowing like a fountain
  37,46,Clear white procuring alacrity to those who drink it
  37,47,Free from intoxicants and not exhaustive to the faculties of the brain
  37,48,Companioned with beautiful women of modest gaze and gleaming eyes radiating splendour
  37,49,"Beauties who look as though they were clear pure white eggs affording keen pleasure to the eye, guarded under the shadow of a gracious wing"
  37,50,And there shall the faithful convey their thoughts reciprocally in talk holding discourse of the why and the wherefore of past events in life below
  37,51,"One of them (a representative) will say: \"I had a companion in life below"
