quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,109,"Therefore, do not doubt -O Muhammad- the evil outcome of the system of faith and worship these people the -idolaters- follow. They follow but the same system their fathers have adopted before. We will apportion to them their share of punishment commensurate with their evil deeds, a punishment which shall neither be diminished nor be abated"
  11,110,"Perhaps Allah will not subject them to annihilation here below on account of the Book -the Quran- which gives free circulation of divine enlightenment and information. The same course of action was adopted when We gave Mussa the Book - AL-Tawrah (the Torah)- and his people were disputant about it, and had it not been for Allah's word proclaimed beforehand to put punishment in respite, their Hereafter would have been planted in the now. Those people were as suspicious of AL- Tawrah, as your people -O Muhammad- are of the Quran"
  11,111,"Nonetheless, both those and these and all and each shall Allah, your- Creator, requite with what is commensurate with their deeds; He is 'Alimun (Omniscient) indeed of all that their minds and souls impel them to do"
  11,112,"Therefore, you Just tread -O Muhammad- together with those who turned to Allah the path of life and action in the manner ordained and lift to Him your inward sight the best you can so as to be men of singular piety, righteousness and virtue. But do not carry things to excess nor transgress. He is Bassirun (Omnipresent) and He sees all that your minds and souls impel you to do"
  11,113,"Nor should your hearts be inclined to follow the wrongful of actions lest you come to be fuel for the Fire, and besides Allah you just have no tutelary protectors nor shall you be afforded the needed help"
  11,114,Observe your act of worship at both ends of the day -the early morning and the close of the day- and at the early hours of the night -following sunset and before bed time- and keep in mind that pious and virtuous deeds cancel evil deeds. This is simply a reminder for those who keep Allah in mind and lift to Him their inward sight
  11,115,"In patience possess you people your souls, therefore, be patient and remember that Allah does not annul, withhold or withdraw the fruit people are entitled to reap from deeds of wisdom and piety"
  11,116,"If only there had been among the preceding generations a class of persons virtuous, strong and influential enough to warn people against corruption and to forbid mischief on earth and prohibit perversion as did the few of them whom We saved. But the wrongful of actions pursued pleasure, and lust after the mundane vanity they were entangled with, and were steeped in crime"
  11,117,"Nor would Allah, your Creator, unjustly destroy the towns when their inhabitants are brewing reform and the fundamental truth governs their thoughts"
