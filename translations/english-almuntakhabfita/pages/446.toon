quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,1,By those angels. who draw up in ranks arranged in even rows
  37,2,And by those who take a firm stand against evil and bring it into reproach to be a reproach to the wrongdoer
  37,3,And by those who recite the Quran to hear the voice of Allah expressing his will
  37,4,Allah your creator is but One and only
  37,5,Creator and Sovereign of the heavens and the earth and of all that lies between and He is their Supreme controlling power. He is the Sovereign of all eastern cardinal points near which the sun rises in its apparent passage through the signs of the zodiac
  37,6,We have embellished the vault of the lowermost heaven with the brilliancy and splendour of the inlaid stars
  37,7,That are posted to serve also as sentinels against every bold satanic and a lawless and wicked spirit
  37,8,"Who peers inquisitively into the realm making an effort to hear what is discussed in the August Assembly, but they are debarred, being assailed with flames on every side"
  37,9,"Fiery discharges forcing them back, that is besides what awaits them of an eternal suffering induced by the lasting torment laid upon the damned"
  37,10,And he who ventures upon catching whatever comes to his hearing of the secrets or future events is pursued by a piercing flame which does not miss
  37,11,"Therefore, ask them O Muhammad: Are they the more difficult to bring into being or the others of Our inanimate created beings We created them -mankind- from coherent clay"
  37,12,"And there, you Muhammad are filled with Admiration and wonder at Allah's infinite power to create what He will and you marvel at His Omnipotence to restore the dead to life Hereafter while they mock the issue and laugh it to scorn"
  37,13,"And when exhorted to acknowledge Allah's Oneness, Uniqueness, Omnipotence and Omniscience, they pay no heed"
  37,14,And when they see a sign attesting to these attributes they look at it as an occasion of derision
  37,15,"And they express their thoughts in words, thus: \"This is nothing but sorcery made evident to the eye and the mind"
  37,16,"Maintaining the false dictum, they add: \"How can we be raised after death and be restored to life after we have been reduced to dust and disintegrated bones"
  37,17,"And does this\", they say, also apply to our forefathers who have long been disintegrated and strewed upon the surface of the earth"
  37,18,"Say to them O Muhammad: \"Yes indeed, and you shall be incensed with multiplied wrongs and humiliation"
  37,19,All it takes is only one single loud call inciting to action and there they get up and rise from bed and be able to look around
  37,20,"And there, they -the infidels- will exclaim thus: \"Woe betide us, this is the promised Day of Judgement"
  37,21,"There and then they will be told: \"This is the Day of Judgement and final decision, the Day on which the faithful are segregated from the infidels, this is the Day you have always denied"
  37,22,Throng all the wrongful of actions together with their wives who habited in falsehood and with those they revered and adored with appropriate acts and rites
  37,23,Who regarded their false gods with extreme devotion besides Allah. Guide them all O angels toward the path leading directly into the abysm of Hell
  37,24,But stop them here for now they have much to answer for
