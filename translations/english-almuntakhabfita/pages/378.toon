quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  27,14,"Unjustly and with inordinate self-esteem, they refused to accept these signs- as emblematic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, notwithstanding that they had a sense perception of the truth in their innermost beings And you can see how fatal was the consequence which united all those characterized with playful malice"
  27,15,"And We bestowed on Dawud (David) and Sulayman (Solomon) divine knowledge for which they were grateful and they expressed their gratitude in words, thus: \"Our bosoms\", they said, \"surge forth answering thanks to Allah Who has privileged us with what is beyond the common advantages of others of His votaries whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues"
  27,16,"And then did Sulayman inherit Dawud's kingdom, spiritual insight and the prophetic office -attributes do not usually go from father to son- and there did he address his people, thus: \"O you people\" he said, \"we have been gracefully taught the language of the birds and we have been granted -by Allah- something of everything, and this is indeed His efficacious grace effecting the end for which it is given"
  27,17,"And to Sulayman were thronged his forces embodying arrays of the Jinn, the men and the birds marshaled in proper order"
  27,18,"And when they reached the valley of the ants -where ants formed a great number of communities or colonies- one ant said to the rest: O you ants go back to your dwellings so that Sulayman and his hosts do not crush you unawares"

  27,20,"And he inspected the birds and took a muster of them, only to find one missing, he said: \"Why do I not see the hoopoe or has he been among the absentees!\" (A bird of the family upupidae especially the typical upupa epops, conspicuous by its variegated plumage and large erectile crest)"
  27,21,"I will punish him severely\", he said, \"or I will slaughter him unless he gives me a convincing excuse"
  27,22,"And there and not far came forth -the hoopoe- into view and said : \"I have learned something you have no knowledge of and I have brought you some objectively certain news from the kingdom of Saba"
