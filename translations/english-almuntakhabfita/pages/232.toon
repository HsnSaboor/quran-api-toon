quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,89,"My people\", he said: \"do not let my diversity of opinion and purpose incite you to sink deeper under the vexations of your minds lest you should be destined to suffer the same fate suffered by the people of Nuh or the people of Hud or the people of Saleh nor are the people of Lut far off from you chronologically, chronographically nor geographically"
  11,90,"And invoke Allah, your Creator, for forgiveness and in lowliest plight stand to Him repentant of the way you conduct yourselves in life. Allah, my Creator, is indeed Rahimun and Wadud (the Merciful) Who comforts whom He sees in distress"
  11,91,"Thus still they said to him: \"We can hardly, O Shuaib, grasp with the mind the comprehension you have of Allah, nor do we understand much of your discourse\". \" In fact we do see that among us, you are but a man wanting in strength and not at all influential, and were it not for your family, we would have pelted you with stones and you are not very strong to prevail against us"
  11,92,"My people \", said Shuaib, \"is my family more esteemed in your sight than Allah Whom you have cast behind your backs and consigned to oblivion ! Indeed, Allah, my Creator, is 'Alimun (Omniscient), of all that your minds and souls impel you to do"
  11,93,"Shuaib continued: \"My people, you may pursue what your minds and souls impel you to do, but I am steering my course of action by guiding indications set by Providence Who guides to all truth\". \"And you shall soon come to know who shall be befallen with a humiliating punishment and who it is that lies and intentionally asserts falsehood. You just be on the watch for the justice prepared above in heaven's realm and I will also be on the watch"
  11,94,"When Our commend came to pass, We rescued Shuaib together with those who gave credence to his mission and acknowledged Allah's message, an act of mercy vouchsafed by us to whom We bless. And how direful was the one cry* from heaven's realm stirring up a merciless blast which overtook the wrongful of actions. They were reduced to a useless form and were laid prostrate and dead under the ruins of their demolished homes"
  11,95,"Devastating was the blast and irretrievable was the disaster that they -the Madianites- looked as if they never dwelt nor flourished whereat they perished, wherefore away from existence were put the Madianites, just as the Thamudites were swept away"
  11,96,We sent Mussa(Moses) well equipped with signs serving to demonstrate delegated divine power and Authority
  11,97,"We sent him to Pharaoh and his people, but they rejected his principles which formed the basis of a chain of reasoning and followed those of Pharaoh whose principles were unprincipled"
