quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"To Him, the Ultimate source and Authority is attributed the knowledge of the point of time of the predetermined and Eventful Hour. And no blossoms come out of their calyces as seeds or fruits, nor does a female - human or animal- conceive a seed in her womb or gives birth to - a child or an animal respectively - but come to His knowledge. And there shall come the Day when He - Allah- calls them up-the infidels - to bring into their minds those whom they incorporated with Him. There and then shall they say: \"We truly acknowledge, by way of reparations, our offence which we do regret and none of us can bear witness to a corporate deity"
  41,48,"And there, they are forsaken and renounced by those whom they regarded and adored before with appropriate acts and rites, who have failed their expectation. And now such a sure watch laid upon them makes them realize that there is no escape"
  41,49,"Nonetheless, man does not weary of invoking Allah's benefaction and benediction, but no sooner he is befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity than he nurses despair and gives up hope"
  41,50,"And if We should extend to man Our mercy and make him taste Our benefaction and benediction following what had befallen him of a misfortune, he ventures to say: \" This is the meritorious outcome of my thought which ran before my action and I doubt if the alleged Eventful Hour will ever present itself, and if I happen to be resurrected and return back to Allah, my Creator, there and then and at His hands shall I merit the desert of good. In effect there and then We will inform those who denied Allah, and refused to acknowledge His Omnipotence and Authority, of the detailed particulars of their life and We will subject them to a condign punishment which doubles their torment"
  41,51,"And when We mercifully bring man in Our grace and show it in Our munificence, he feels impelled to move away and more distant from what Allah inclines him to propound. And when he is befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity- in consequence of his wrongful and unclean hands- he spends his breath invoking Allah's mercy and blessings"
  41,52,"Say to them -the infidels- : \"What if it -the Quran- is a disclosure of knowledge and wisdom and a guide from Allah, and you refuse to acknowledge it ! who then will have strayed far and wandered widely from the path of righteousness"
  41,53,"We will exhibit to them Our marvels in the remote parts of the universe and within themselves until it becomes evident to them that it -the Quran- is the truth personified and the glory of Allah by it is typified. Is it not enough that Allah, your Creator, is Shahidun (a witness) of all things"
  41,54,"Yet they continue to be in doubt of the encounter with Allah their Creator. However, never doubt but He is Mohiton (the Omnipresent who is Omniscient of all things in all respects and all in all)"
