quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  16,119,"Nevertheless, Allah, your Creator, always extends mercy and forgiveness to those who wrong themselves in ignorance and repent thereafter imprinting their deed with wisdom and piety; Allah, your Creator, is indeed Ghafurun and Rahimun"
  16,120,"Ibrahim (Abraham) was indeed a perfect example of excellence, submissive to the will of Allah and an Orthodox Muslim. He never incorporated with Allah other deities"
  16,121,He was always thankful for the grace of Allah abounding in him; Allah chose him and guided him to His path of righteousness
  16,122,And We bestowed upon him Our prevenient and efficacious grace here and he shall be a crown to the virtuous Hereafter
  16,123,"And We inspired to you O Muhammad what We ordained: that you follow the system of faith and worship followed by Ibrahim, the orthodox Muslim who never incorporated with Allah other deities"
  16,124,The Sabbath was imposed on those who were hard hearted and always disputed with their prophet and argued against its validity and its timing -the Jews- Saturday and the Christians -Sunday- and many among them defiantly and shamefully broke it. And they shall always contend with opposing arguments until Allah settles their dispute in Day of Judgement
  16,125,"Invite people O Muhammad graciously to the path of Allah, the path of righteousness, with wise, graceful and appropriate inducements meeting them on their own ground and propitiating them, each in his own capacity, to open their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes. Reason with them in a logical, peaceable and gracious manner; Allah, your Creator, knows best those who have wandered from His path of righteousness and He knows best those who steer a straight course and Providence their guide"
  16,126,"And if you should inflict punishment, exact a retribution or make reprisals for injury, harm or wrong, then you may avenge your right with a similar injury and to the same extent. But if you bear the wrong and bear with the wrongful -as an obligation to Allah and not a reflection of human weakness- you shall possess your souls, derive great benefits and advantage yourselves of Allah's expectative grace"
  16,127,"And have patience O Muhammad, show forbearance under their provocation and bear with them their faults and limitations. For in patience, you apply yourself unto Allah Who consoles your soul and your heart unto wisdom which alleviates your mental distress. And do not be grieved at heart for their denial of the divine message and for their hearts which dare rise defiant against Allah. Nor should you be sorely distressed on account of their cunning which they take for a sinister and crooked wisdom"
  16,128,"Rest assured that Allah upholds those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence"
