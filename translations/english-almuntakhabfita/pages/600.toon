quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,And all that was hidden in the peoples’ chests become personified and manifest
  100,11,And that this is the Day their Creator reveals to them secrets He knows; which secrets they had long forgotten
  101,1,The Big Event of the violent collision of all celestial bodies
  101,2,How pounding is that collision
  101,3,You just do not know what is like this violent collision
  101,4,People will be like moths scattered about
  101,5,And the mountains will be like flakes of wool carded out
  101,6,Then he whose scales are tipped in favour of deeds of wisdom and piety
  101,7,He will live a life of bliss in the exalted and blissful society
  101,8,But he whose good works are light in weight and below par
  101,9,Will be fostered by the deep bottomless abyss
  101,10,And you just do not know what it is like in the abyss

  102,3,There and then will you come to know all that is in conformity with truth and verity
  102,4,But indeed you will come to know what is in accordance with fact and reality

  102,6,For you will see the Hell fire awaiting the unjust who failed to reason their own conclusions
  102,7,And you will see it with the eye of certainty
  102,8,"There and then shall you be asked of how you used the fruits of the years you received to your comfort and to your enjoyment and content, and how you exercised your faculties divine with which Allah had endowed you and to what extent"
