  26,113,"Their case\", he added, \"shall only be judged by Allah, my Creator, in Whose hands rests the authoritative decision, if only you could apprehend matters with your senses"
  26,114,Nor would I dismiss those who conformed their will to Allah's will
  26,115,"I am only\", he added, \"a spectacle and a warning"
  26,116,"They said; \"We warn you Nuh\", \"unless you stop your course of action you shall be stoned to death"
  26,117,"And there Nuh prayed: \"My people, O Allah, my Creator, disbelieved me and refused credence to Your message"
  26,118,"Judge O Allah\", he prayed, \"and defend my cause which is the heart of your purpose and decide between me and them in Your way, (for You take the matters of fact as they come and circumstance them after Your own manner) and save me and those with me who conformed to Islam"
  26,119,"And there, We saved him along with all those in his society on board the loaded Ark"

  26,125,"I am,\" he added, \"A Messenger entrusted with a divine message and here do I relate it to you in honour and sincerity"

  26,127,"I do not charge you a price\", he said, \"for imparting to you Allah's disclosures of divine knowledge, wisdom and practical divinity. My reward rests at the hands of Allah, The Creator of the worlds"
  26,128,"Do you erect buildings\", he added, \"on the top of every mount and every height, mansions and stately buildings standing in the landscape, conspicuous to view as though they are landmarks (yet not as a guide nor a mark of an event) serving no useful purpose and of no avail"
