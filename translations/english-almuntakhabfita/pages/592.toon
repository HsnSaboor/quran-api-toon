quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,"But you people prefer the life here afore the heavenly b1iss, knowing it is illusive and alluring"
  87,17,"While the Hereafter is far better, blissful, infinitely lasting and enduring"
  87,18,"This indeed, has been emphasized in the earlier Scriptures"
  87,19,The Scriptures of Ibrahim and Mussa
  88,1,Have you been informed of the great talk apropos the overwhelming Event
  88,2,Some faces are then incensed with humiliation
  88,3,"Reflecting the heedless life they spent uselessly, unprofitably and improvidently; and now they look faint and sick with travail and fear"
  88,4,"They are entering into Hell, to suffer the intense heat of the blazing Fire"
  88,5,Only to be given to drink from water bubbling in agitation and issuing from a boiling hot spring
  88,6,"And nothing will they feed on but poisonous, noxious, foul thorny shrubs"
  88,7,Which neither nourish nor pacify their hunger pains
  88,8,There will be other faces radiant with delight
  88,9,Pleased with doing their endeavour in life lifting to Allah their inward sight
  88,10,Enjoying the exalted gardens of Bliss
  88,11,"No matter of little value or insignificance will they hear therein, nor will they hear ill - tongues or what is morally evil"
  88,12,Therein is water streaming forth from a delightful spring
  88,13,Therein are dignified seats covered with embroidered cloth woven in gold and ornamented with brocade
  88,14,And drinking glasses set at hand
  88,15,"And cushions, ranked in rows, so bedecked and ornate"
  88,16,And rich carpets all round
  88,17,Do they - the pagan Arabs - not ponder how camels* were created
  88,18,How the heavens* have been distantly elevated
  88,19,How the mountains* which stabilize the earth have been firmly erected
  88,20,And how the earth has been expanded* and prepared for life thereon
  88,21,"You just continue to exhort the people, for you are here to put them in mind of Allah"
  88,22,And no authority have you over them
  88,23,But he whose attitude has served to disincline him from doing reverence to Allah and to turn a deaf ear to all He has ordained
  88,24,"Will He requite him with a condign punishment and in Hell will he forever, be detained"
  88,25,Unto Us shall be their return
  88,26,"And then, their judgement will be Our concern"
