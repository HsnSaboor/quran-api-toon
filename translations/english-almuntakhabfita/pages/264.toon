quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  15,32,"What kept you, O Iblis\", Allah Asked, \"from joining those who cast themselves down in reverence and admiration"
  15,33,"It is not I\", Iblis said, \"who would cast himself down in reverence to a human whom You created from dried clay, a product of dark modeling clay that has been polished"
  15,34,"Then get out of hence\", Allah said, \" you are dismissed and accursed"
  15,35,And the curse shall pursue you till The Day of Judgment
  15,36,"Then Iblis requested Allah saying: \"delay, my condemnation\", O Allah till the Day of Resurrection"
  15,37,"Reprieve is granted\", Allah said, \"respiting your condemnation"
  15,38,Till the specified Day on which the point of time has been predetermined
  15,39,"Now, O Allah\", Iblis said, that You have destined me and I have erred, I will entangle them with the bird-lime of fleshy passions, mundane vanity and temporalities and I will entice them all to do evil and I will incite idle men to tempt me to tempt them"
  15,40,But not the devout among Your worshippers whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand and they lift to You their inward sight
  15,41,"This is the path\", Allah said, \"the devout tread. It is the path of righteousness which leads directly to Me"
  15,42,"My devout worshippers\", Allah continued, \"do not come under your authority nor have you the power to influence their conduct and actions; you only have influence over those who follow you and in vanity they waste their days"
  15,43,And Hell is indeed the destination wherein shall they all make their abode
  15,44,"Apprehended in a material sense, it has seven gates through each of which shall enter those appropriated to the degree of suffering that is commensurate with their evil deeds"
  15,45,Whereas those who have always entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah shall be blessed with divine favour. They are destined to make abode in blissful gardens in the beatitude of heaven fountained wits dazzling springs
  15,46,"They will be addressed with expression of good will, thus: \"Make entry into Paradise\", they are told, \"We bid you a hearty welcome wherein you shall live in peace, safe and secure"
  15,47,"And We will have erased malevolence from their breasts and injurious events from their memories; now they are an association of brothers spiritually allied to each other, seated on thrones of dignity facing each other"
  15,48,There and then they are not overtaken by fatigue nor shall there be an impression of it upon their minds or their souls nor shall they be asked to leave or depart therefrom
  15,49,Tell My servants O Muhammad that I am indeed AL-Ghafur (the Forgiving) and AL-Rahim (the Merciful)
  15,50,and also that My retributive punishment is indeed severe; it is the torment laid upon the damned
  15,51,And inform their thoughts O Muhammad with the disguised angels who were the guests of Ibrahim
