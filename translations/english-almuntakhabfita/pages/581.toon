  77,21,"Fluid whose product, the fertilized seed,* We embedded in the depth of a safe and secure situation (the womb)"
  77,22,For a determined period of gestation
  77,23,"We then determined, besides the span of this period, the relevant constitution and how right is the determination"
  77,24,"Woe then, to those who looked upon the truth as an intentional assertion of falsehood"
  77,25,Did We not make the earth widely spread
  77,26,To accommodate the living and the dead
  77,27,"Did We not establish therein firm mountains* to afford stabilization, and furnish you with a supply of fresh water from springs, rain fall and other sources, each, in a blessed stead"
  77,28,"Woe then, to those who looked upon the truth as an intentional assertion of falsehood"
  77,29,"There and then shall the wicked be told \"Now suffer the consequence of what you denied and treated as falsehood"
  77,30,"Go to the blaze, with its fumes and scarlet shade and its flames that are shooting out in three colossal branches"
  77,31,"Which neither screen, nor hide nor protect from the heat or from the blazing flames streaming in avalanches"
  77,32,Fire throwing off sparks as immense as the fortress
  77,33,Sparks looking like huge implements covered with copper troubling the infidels grievously and subjecting them to a severe distress

  77,37,Woe. then to those who looked upon the truth as an intentional assertion of falsehood
  77,38,"This is the Day of decision and adjudication, and thereon will We throng you all including all who came before"
  77,39,"Now if you have a plan to evade judgment, conduct it to conclusion if you can"
  77,40,Woe then to those who looked upon the truth as an intentional assertion of what is false
