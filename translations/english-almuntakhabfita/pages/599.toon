  98,8,"There awaits them in Allah's realm the abode in the Gardens of Eden beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity, Allah well pleased with them and they with Him; a reward commensurate with the equitable deeds achieved by him who has entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, his Creator"
