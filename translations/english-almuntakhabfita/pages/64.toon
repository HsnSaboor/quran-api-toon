quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,109,"To Allah belong all that is in the Heavens and all that is on Earth, and to Allah, the Ultimate Authority, are committed and submitted all matters and all affairs for consideration, decision and execution here and in the Hereafter"
  3,110,You Muslims have been the best people* that have evolved from mankind for mankind. You enjoin equity and you recourse to general principles of justice. You forbid all that is wrongful and obscene and you conform your will to Allah’s blessed will
  3,111,They will not hurt your interests O Mohammad nor will they harm you. They will only be a source of annoyance. If they war against you they will turn tail and seek safety in flight and will not be crowned with victory
  3,112,"They have been stamped with humiliation (The Jews) wherever they are found, except when they come to be under the tutelage of Allah and at peace with people. They came within the measure of Allah’s wrath and they were stamped with mortification of pride. Their unjustifiable slaying of the Prophets was in the train of their defiance of piety. Their disobedience was natural to them that it became an addiction to transgression"
  3,113,"But in fairness to them, Ahl AL-Kitab are not all alike. Among them are a people who conform their will to Allah’s blessed will; a people who recite verses of Allah’s revelations by night and bow to the ground in reverence and adoration and prostrate their reason to divine revelation"
  3,114,They believe in Allah with hearts impressed with images of religious and spiritual virtues and they are mindful of the Hereafter. They enjoin equity and recourse to general principles of justice and they condemn the bad and emulate the best. Such people are enrolled among the righteous
  3,115,"Whatever good they do, they shall never be denied the fruit nor the reward of any deed imprinted with wisdom and piety. Allah is fully aware of those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him"
