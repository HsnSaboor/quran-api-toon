quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  57,12,"One day, you shall see those whose hearts - reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues among the men and the women disposed to merriment, their faces glowing with light emanating from Allah's countenance and proceeding ahead of them. It illuminates the way for them when they contemplate the most difficult and inevitable crossing; carrying their books bearing their records in their right hands. There and then they will be complimented upon their happy event of winning their way to paradise beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity, and how befitting and how exulting is the triumph"
  57,13,"This is the Day when the hypocrites, among the men and the women, will say to those whose hearts reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues: \"Would you look back in our direction, so that we avail ourselves of your light\". But they will be told: \"Go back to where we were granted light and pray for it\" only to find themselves separated from those who are blessed and shut out behind a barrier emitting mercy to those within and torment to those without"
  57,14,"Then they -the hypocrites- call out to those who are blessed and say to them: \"Had we not been together Here and Hereafter and together we attended assemblies of prayers and pilgrimage and together we fought\". Indeed we were together, say the virtuous \"but you counseled deaf and you closed your hearts' ears and your minds' eyes and did not keep back from the forbidden. You were illuded with the false hopes that gratifying your appetite was something instinctively felt to be right and fair, and with Satanic deceit you had forgotten calling Allah to mind"
  57,15,"And so now, and on this Day, no atonement can be accepted neither from you -hypocrites- nor from those who denied Allah to ransom your ill deeds even if it be as much gold as there is on earth\". \"Hell is the place where you make abode; and how evil is the destination"
  57,16,Is it not time that those who have conformed to Islam open their hearts' ears so that their breasts be filled with reverential awe as they listen to the Quran and accord with what it says and with the truth it declares. They should not be like those who have been given the Book before them who have transmuted the Book to their purpose throughout the years and became hard hearted? Indeed many among them are wicked
  57,17,You must know that Allah revivifies* the earth after it has suffered death; We have expounded for you -people- Our revelations and meritoriously elucidated them that you may hopefully apprehend the voice from heaven and express as much joy as your hearts may comprehend
  57,18,"The benevolent, among the men and the women, who have lent Allah all they could of benevolence and pious deeds toward future security will be reimbursed with many times the like and will be entitled to a meritorious reward"
