quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  50,1,"Qaf, and by what it represents and what it stands for as a natural symbol of adoration, and by the distinguished Quran featuring the glory of Allah Who is the final cause of creation and the highest aim of intelligent creatures"
  50,2,"There is no reason to marvel at the recognition of a man who came to you people from your midst as a spectacle and a warning to you all and you refuse to accept him in his capacity and the infidels say: \" It is indeed strange"
  50,3,"How can We be raised after death when we have been reduced to dust?\" \"This idea of Resurrection, studiously sought out, is indeed far fetched"
  50,4,"But We Have already and thus early known to what extent has the earth consumed of the corpses of their dead, (or it may be; what the earth shall regularly consume of them by death) We keep a book where everything is related in writing and set down in a permanent form"
  50,5,"Yet the infidels denied the truth when it was presented to them and treated the Messenger as one who passes himself as someone other than he is, as if they were involved in doubt and anxiety about a matter on account of its intricate character"
  50,6,"Did they not direct their intellectual eye at the heaven above them with its regions, spheres, realms of space and celestial bodies, and ponder how skillfully, powerfully and authoritatively did We construct and furnish with ornaments and with qualities that give distinction and render impossible any flaws"
  50,7,"And the earth* how We spread and stretch out and furnished with mountains placed in a certain setting, fixed as with an anchor, and therein did We produce and cause to grow a set of every kind of variegated vegetation"
  50,8,To impart insight of the mind and an admonition to be put in mind of every votary devoted to religious observances with breast filled with reverential awe
  50,9,And how We sent down from the floor of the vault of heaven showers of blessed rain and with its instrumentality did We vegetate orchards and grain to be reaped and gathered in
  50,10,And the tallish -palm- trees with pinnates of fan-shaped leaves and sprouting offshoots of variegated and delicious fruits
  50,11,And how with rain We produce victuals for the people and restore life to a dead land ! and so also shall be Resurrection
  50,12,"Long before them - the Meccans - did the people of Nuh (Noah) and those of the town of Rass and those of Thamud (the Thamudites), suspect their Messengers of falsehood"
  50,13,And so did the people of 'Ad the -'Adites- and those of Pharaoh and the contemporaries of Lut (Lot)
  50,14,"And similarly did the forest dwellers and the people of the King of Yemen, all of whom suspected their Messengers, of falsehood, and there, was fulfilled the prophecy of the punitive event to the wicked"
  50,15,Did We grow weary and worn out with fatigue with the first creation that you people suspect the validity of a new creation
