quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  68,43,"They stand drooping their sight and drooping their souls, hollow-eyed, gazing in bewilderment and fear and gazing their souls away, mortified, despaired of hope and discredited by the base and ignominious cover of their quality and conduct; yet they were admonished in life to bow to the ground in adoration when conditions were wholesome but they did not"
  68,44,"So leave to Me the one who refuses to admit the truth of the Quran. We shall give such persons enough rope and allow them free scope, so that they overreach and commit themselves to an evil line of conduct and be swept away in the general cataclysm"
  68,45,"I give them respite and delay My action, but My scheme of action is decisive, conclusive, strict and unfailing, it strikes at the root"
  68,46,"Or do you invite them O Muhammad and present them with inducements to follow the path of truth and reality for something in return, and so they are charged with a debt that burdens them or brings them under such liability! The truth is that they are obstinate, not that they hold opinions but the opinions hold them"
  68,47,"Or do they, of all people, apprehend and comprehend what is by nature not an object of sight and they commit it to writing"
  68,48,"So be patient O Muhammad and forbear their faults and limitations until Allah judges between you and them. Be not like (Zun Nun) (Jonah ) who fled his people because of their hostility and neglected his responsibility toward Allah. He went to the sea only to be swallowed by the fish. And in distress and utter darkness, he invoked Allah’s forgiveness and mercy"
  68,49,"And had it not been for the grace and mercy of Allah, his Creator, on him, he would have been cast in the open, low on his knees, brought down to a bad and disagreeable condition, discredited with infamy and shame"
  68,50,"But Allah relented and quit him all His debt, and with divine grace he came to be of the righteous whose deeds were imprinted with wisdom and piety"
  68,51,"When the infidels hear you O Muhammad recite the Quran they turn their attention to you and their eyes almost breathe vengeance; their ill-will and their hatred forged in their bosoms that their tongues must vent, have vented your accusation of being a demoniac"
  68,52,"When in effect -the Quran- is but a universal message which people are yet to learn, and an admonition and a counsel of the greatest concern"
  69,1,The absolute reality
  69,2,What a reality
  69,3,You just do not know what the Day of Reality is like
  69,4,The people of Thamud -the Thamudites- and those of 'Ad - the 'Adites denied that Day of the stunning roar concurrent with the collision of the celestial bodies
  69,5,The Thamudites were destroyed by an overwhelming thunderous convulsion of the earth's surface produced by a natural force within the earth's crust
  69,6,"And the 'Adites were destroyed by a cold terrifying destructive hurricane, merciless, pitiless and unrelenting"
  69,7,Which hurricane was calculated and directed against them for seven successive nights and eight successive days; you could see their dwellings collapsing making fresh victims. They lay prostrate as if they were hollow trunks of palm trees tumbled down by an unruly wind
  69,8,And now do you see any of them who had outlasted or remained a survivor
