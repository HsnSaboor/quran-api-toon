quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,63,"There did Saleh say: \" My people, pause here and think and think but this: what if Allah has enlightened my thoughts and my innermost being and imparted to me knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light and extended His mercy to me! Then, how can I neglect the duty of relating His message to the people when it has been entrusted to me. This shall be disobedience\". \"if I am to disobey Allah, who then can save me from His punishment!\" \"You people are simply trying to lead me into error and make me lose my way and incur privation of Allah's mercy"
  11,64,"My people\", he added, \"this is the she -camel of Allah, representing a distinct sign symbolic of the truth of my mission. Let her graze upon the grass- land of Allah and do not lay hands on her nor meddle with her to harm, her, lest you would be overtaken by a dire punishment before long"
  11,65,"Thus still they disabled her by cutting her hamstring muscles, and there did Saleh say to them: \"You have only three days to lust after your sinful system of faith and worship and after the way you conduct yourselves in life. This, is indeed, an irrevocable promise not proving untrue"
  11,66,"When Our command came to pass, We rescued Saleh and those who gave credence to his mission and acknowledged Allah's message, an act of mercy vouchsafed by us to save them from the shame and the multiplied humiliations incurred on that Momentous Day. Allah, your Creator is indeed AL-Qawiy(the Omnipotent) and AL- Aziz Who prevails against the whole and all in all"
  11,67,"Direful was the one cry from heaven's realm, it stirred up a merciless blast which overtook the wrongful of actions. There, they were reduced to a useless form laying prostrate and dead under the ruins of their demolished homes"
  11,68,"Devastating was the blast and irretrievable was the disaster that they -the Thamudites- looked as if they never dwelt nor flourished whereat they perished. Indeed, the Thamudites had refused to acknowledge Allah, their Creator, and their hearts dared rise defiant against Him, wherefore away from existence were put the Thamudites"
  11,69,"For once did Our Messengers -disguised angels- pay a visit to Ibrahim(Abraham) and intimate to him the good news -of begetting a son-. They greeted him with the expression of good will \"Peace\" which he returned to assure them they were welcomed. Thereafter he placed before them a generous meal of a fatted roasted calf"
  11,70,"But when he noticed that they did not stretch out their hands to eat, back he recoiled apprehensive and pervaded with fear. They consoled him and in good will they said to him: \"Do not be afraid; we have been sent to those sinful people of Lut(Lot)"
  11,71,"His wife, standing in dose proximity, overheard what was said and -laughed in her skepticism- or -in her joy-, and there, We announced to her the good news of begetting a son, Ishaq (Isaa)"
