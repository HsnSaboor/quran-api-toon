quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  12,96,"But when the harbinger of good presage -the eldest brother- reached home, and laid Yusuf's shirt on his father's face; there did Ya'qab recover his faculty of sight. and thus he exclaimed: \"Did I not tell you that I know from Allah what you people do not know"
  12,97,"There said the ten –guilty- sons to their father: \"O father, invoke Allah's forgiveness on our behalf for what We committed of sinful deeds; we were indeed wrongful of actions"
  12,98,"The father said: \"I will invoke Allah's forgiveness; on your behalf, my Creator is indeed AL-Ghafur (the Forgiving) AL-Rahim (the Merciful)"
  12,99,"When they all went to Egypt and were granted audience of Yusuf, he took his parents (father and stepmother- aunt who fostered him-) beside him and he said to them: \"You are very welcome to reenter into Egypt where you make abode, Allah willing, safe and secure"
  12,100,"And he raised aloft his parents to his -the vizier's- seat of dignity and Authority and there and then did all of them bow to the ground in respect, reverence and admiration. There, said Yusuf to his father: \"O father, this is the interpretation of my vision which was brought before my mind's eyes during sleep, and Allah has verified it and made it come true\". \"He was gracious to me; He brought to effect my release from prison and your emigration from the desert in Can'an to settle in the city in Egypt after AL-Shaytan had sown malevolence and ill-will in my brothers' bosoms against me\". \"Indeed Allah, my Creator, moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform as He will; He is indeed AL-'Alim and AL-Hakim"
  12,101,"To express his gratitude to Allah, he -Yusuf- came out with an invocatory prayer, thus: \"O Allah, my Creator, You have graced me with pre-eminence in respect of power, dominion and authority, and You have imparted to me the knowledge of interpreting visions and what they prefigure of future events; You are the Creator, Who generated the heavens and the earth; You are my Tutelary Guardian here and Hereafter.\" \"Disembody my soul, O Allah, impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and join me to those whose deeds had been imprinted with wisdom and piety"
  12,102,"Such narrative as We have inspired to you O Muhammad is an epitome of the chief points of a larger invisible work embracing unseen forces and motives, thoughts and feelings, complications and results not usually seen or perceived by people but win through in the end as Allah has planned. Nor were you O Muhammad in their circles when they ( the brothers, the retinue and the women resolved unanimously to accomplish what they had maliciously schemed)"
  12,103,"Nor are most people moved by the convincing divine signs and marvels, expositions and illustrations to exercise spiritual apprehension of divine truths nor do they justify faith as a conviction operative on their character and will, even though you Muhammad are full of keen desire to guide them into all truth"
