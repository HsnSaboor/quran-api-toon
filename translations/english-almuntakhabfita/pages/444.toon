quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  36,55,And this Day shall those destined to the abode in Paradise be preoccupied with the world of supreme blessedness in which they do rejoice beyond a common joy
  36,56,And together with their mates they shall be reclining on luxurious couches in the shades afforded by trees and overshadowing foliage
  36,57,Wherein they shall enjoy fruits as well as all that they think of and whatever they ask for
  36,58,"They shall be greeted with the expression of good will \"Peace\" from Allah, the Creator, Who is indeed Rahimun"
  36,59,"And the infidels are addressed, thus: \"Excluded and confined you are, O you transgressors of the divine law and offenders against Allah"
  36,60,"In reproach they are told; \"Did I not,\" says Allah \"enjoin you children of Adam to reject AL-Shaytan (Satan) and those with characteristics befitting him and to refuse credence to them, for he was indeed your avowed enemy and deadly foe"
  36,61,"And I prescribed for you authoritatively and with emphasis that you worship Me, for this was indeed the path of righteousness, the path that leads directly to Me"
  36,62,Indeed AL-Shaytan had succeeded in misleading you in great numbers. Did you have no sense to realize and confess yourselves mistaken

  36,66,"And had it been Our will We would have eclipsed their eye sight and their minds' eyes, then they would have competed with each other for finding their way, but how could they have been able to see it"
  36,67,"And had We willed We would have transmuted them and frozen them physically and spiritually in their unprivileged site, then they would have been unable to move forward to repent and do good nor backward to do evil"
  36,68,"Do they not ponder that he whom We carry through the stealing steps of age to advanced life, We cause to relapse into a degenerate and degraded state of mind, activity, knowledge, strength and status and make him lose the qualities and attributes he once possessed. Do they not deviate into sense and contemplate this fact"
  36,69,"And We did not teach him poetry nor did We instruct him to play the poet or compose poetry nor does it befit him as a Messenger of Allah. What he discourses is indeed a divine message and nothing but a Quran that is intelligible, imparting illumination and enlightenment"
  36,70,"To use it as the means for a profitable end and to exhort those who are living and spiritually receptive to Allah's commands and to warn those who are spiritually dead to alter their irreverent course of action when warned of its danger, wherefore infidelity shall be justly laid to their charge"
