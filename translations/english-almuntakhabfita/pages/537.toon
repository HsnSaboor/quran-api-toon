quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,"That: the wording revealed to Our Messenger is but a distinguished Book, worthy of honour and entitled to respect, esteem and reverence"
  56,78,A Quran derived from a source- Book- well guarded in the heaven's realm
  56,79,"A Quran that is not to be touched or taken in the hands which are not free from dirt or filth or not free from ceremonial or sanitary defilement, nor in the hands of anyone who has had sexual congress until he or she has bathed"
  56,80,"For it is a Revelation of knowledge to man by his Creator the Divine Creator of the worlds, past, present and those to come"
  56,81,Is it not a pity that you people declare such a Revelation to be untrue
  56,82,And you prosper by refusing to acknowledge it and by refusing to admit it as authentic and authoritatively true
  56,83,"So, what about the moment of the encounter with death when the soul is on its way out and it makes a rattle in the throat"
  56,84,"And you are then on the watch for what is expected, but unable to avert the inevitable"
  56,85,"There and then We are in his or her immediate proximity and far closer to the dying than you can possibly perceive or imagine, but you cannot see"
  56,86,"And so, if, as is the case, you deny you're Creator and you deny Resurrection and the Day of Reckoning"
  56,87,Why then are you unable to restore the soul to the dying if what you claim is true
  56,88,If he or she is one of those nearest to Allah s special blessedness and he or she stands high in His favour
  56,89,"Then a great welcome and a rich smell of sweet air, fragrance and the beatitude of heaven"
  56,90,And if he or she is among those who had dearly earned the disposition on the right
  56,91,"Then a greeting of \" Peace be upon you \" shall be addressed by the angels who express good will"
  56,92,But if he or she be among those who denied the truth and strayed from the path of righteousness
  56,93,Then in the boiling pot shall he or she make abode
  56,94,And he or she shall go down in Hell to the pit
  56,95,This is but the true picture of the destiny awaiting such persons and the truth which admits of no relaxation
  56,96,"Therefore, O man, you should praise the diving attributes and advance the glory of the Name of Allah your Creator who conducts and advances your growth and inspires you with actuation"
  57,1,"Praise be to Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes\", is an act of worship ascribed by all beings in the heavens, the spiritual, the animate and the inanimate on earth, and He is AL-Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Hakim ( the Wise)"
  57,2,To Him belongs the absolute sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; He gives life and inspirits the property of animate existence and He occasions death and deprives of animate existence
  57,3,"He is the First and the Foremost, He is the Last and the Utmost, He is infinite, He is beyond and above all, yet exposed to the mental view and accessible to appeals, and He is beyond and below all to give support to all in all; His marvels are inherent in the whole and He is the Omnipresent Who holds prescience of all events, He is the ultimate goal and He is AL-Alim (the Omniscient) who knows all"
