quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When once the sun is contracted and loses light and becomes dim
  81,2,"The stars emit no light, lose aspect, contribute to cosmic catastrophes and they are no longer in trim"
  81,3,The mountains are put in motion and vanish
  81,4,The precious pregnant she - camels are forsaken
  81,5,The wild beasts are thronged
  81,6,The seas boil and become inundated
  81,7,"The like are consorted with the like, joined in companionship and associated (or the souls embodied)"
  81,8,The entombed - alive female infant is asked
  81,9,For what guilt was she made to suffer infanticide
  81,10,And when the records are laid open and are open wide
  81,11,And when the heaven is erased
  81,12,And when Hell is blazed
  81,13,And when Paradise is brought close at hand
  81,14,"Then, every soul becomes fully cognizant of what she brought along of deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety or works imprinted with iniquity and impiety"
  81,15,I swear by the heavenly bodies that recede
  81,16,The planets which in a retrograde motion do proceed
  81,17,And by the night when she feels her way and then softly moves away
  81,18,And by the morn when it draws the breath of relief and heyday
  81,19,That it -the Quran- is the word of Allah conveyed by a distinguished Messenger Jibril (Gabriel) who is regarded with honour
  81,20,He is quite powerful and he is endued from the Throne of grace with high esteem
  81,21,And he is obeyed in the realm and to his trust he is faithfully supreme
  81,22,Nor is your companion the -Prophet Muhammad- possessed by an evil spirit
  81,23,For he certainly saw him -the angel Jibril- at the clear horizon
  81,24,Nor should he be accused of withholding any heavenly or divine knowledge of the unseen
  81,25,Nor is it -the Quran- the word of an accursed spirit
  81,26,How could you think this way and where can you turn
  81,27,This Quran is but a universal message and an admonition of great concern
  81,28,"For him who, among you, wishes to follow the path of rectitude which is the path in the main"
  81,29,But even then you cannot exercise your will unless it be Allah's will; He is the Creator of the worlds
