quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  40,34,"And before Mussa, came Yusuf (Joseph) who was sent to you with clear evidence of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, but you remained in a state of uncertainty as to the truth and reality of what he presented to you. And when he died you claimed that never shall Allah send after him another Messenger; thus does Allah neglect him who is extravagant in his account of himself, who is doubtful of the truth and He leaves him to wander from His path of righteousness"
  40,35,"Those who contend with opposing argument against Our signs and seem resolved to dispute the truth of Our revelations without being furnished with proof, occasion Allah's strong disgust as well as the strong repugnance of those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues; Such objectionable disposition does Allah imprint on the heart of every extravagant in his account of himself, shackled with tyranny"
  40,36,"And Pharaoh said to his grand vizier: \"O Haman: erect for me a lofty building soaring skyward; I may find the means of attaining my objective"
  40,37,"The means to get to the heaven's realm where I may meet and converse with the Allah of Mussa to prove my point that Mussa, as I think, is indeed a liar. \"And thus was Pharaoh enticed by his deeds of evil and iniquity alluring his mind's eyes and inducing him to hug his irreverent conviction to his heart and was swayed from the path of righteousness, The plan devised by Pharaoh attained no end but only a ruthless destiny"
  40,38,"Then said he whose heart had been touched with the divine hand: \"O people: follow me and keep up with my train of thoughts; I will lead you to the path of righteousness"
  40,39,"O people\" he added, \"life here is but an evanescent and ephemeral enjoyment, whereas the Hereafter is indeed the settled eternal abode"
  40,40,"He who willfully violates a religious or a moral principle shall not be requited but with the like thereof, and he or she whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety shall he welcomed into gardens of bliss and surpassing beauty wherein they are provided for without measure"
