quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,31,Sincerely maintaining the precepts of Allah's system of faith and worship authoritatively established by Him and not incorporating with Him other deities. And he who incorporates with Him other deities shall stand similitude exact of someone who has fallen from heaven and been snatched by the birds of prey -which make a rapid sweeping descent upon its prey- or been swept away by a storm in its fury to a distant and far off place
  22,32,"So be it, and he who honours Allah's sacred acts and rites and turns his thoughts upon the duties owed to Him will have won Allah's affection; for honouring Allah's rites is an endearment of the hearts reflective of piety"
  22,33,"You advantage yourselves of them up to a determined point of time then they are taken to where they belong, the Ancient Sacrosanct House, where they are sacrificed and pilgrimage will have had all its rites"
  22,34,"And to every people did We authoritatively determine certain rites -of sacrifice- that they may use the sacred event to commemorate Allah's Name and perform the sacrifice under the immolation of His Name as a form of warm feeling of good will and gratitude for what He has provided for them of live stock reared for food. For indeed, your Allah is One and only. Therefore, conform your will to His will -in Islam-. Meanwhile, announce O Muhammad joyful tidings to those"
  22,35,Who lift to Allah their inward sight while their innermost being is actuated with the feeling of dread mingled with veneration at the mention and the thought of Him
  22,36,"And the camels and cows did We make lawful for you to use in the event of your oblation of thanks giving and in your offering. They serve as a store from which you obtain advantages in plenty. Therefore, pronounce Allah's Name on them as they are lined up, slaughtered and laid on their sides. You may eat therefrom and feed him who is content and satisfied in mind despite poverty, as well as him who is needy and circumstances compel him to beg. Thus did We make them -these animals- subservient for you that you may hopefully impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness"
  22,37,"It is not their flesh nor their blood that reaches Allah. It is only the piety on your part, the obedience and the faithfulness to the duties owed to Him. We made them subservient to you so that you may praise Allah and extoll His glorious attributes in return for His guidance to you into all truth. Meanwhile proclaim O Muhammad joyful tidings to those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety"
  22,38,"Indeed, Allah defends those whose hearts are imprinted with the image of religious and spiritual virtues whereas He simply detests the dishonest, the unfaithful and the treacherous given to infidelity and ingratitude"
