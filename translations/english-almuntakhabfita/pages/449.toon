  37,77,And We destined his posterity to be the survivors who inhabit the earth
  37,78,And We praised his name to fame that he be honoured by those to come of future and later generations
  37,79,Peace be unto Nuh and hailed shall he be with reverential salutations among succeeding generations
  37,80,For thus do We requite those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence and imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety
  37,81,He was one of Our votaries whose purpose was the heart of Our purpose
  37,82,And We drowned the others who were at variance with Our system of faith and worship
  37,83,And among those who followed his doctrine which mirrored Allah's will and His religious principles was Ibrahim
  37,84,"Who presented himself to Allah, his Creator, with a pure, undefiled and sound heart"
  37,85,"He questioned the truth of his peoples' system of faith and worship. He said to his father and to his people: \"What is it that you worship"
  37,86,"Do you choose\", he said, \"to revere false gods besides Allah, the Creator, and adore them with appropriate acts and rites\". Is this what you boldly deem the right path to tread and you insist on brewing falsehood and thinking falsehood"
  37,87,"He asked, \"What do you think then of Allah Creator of the worlds, past, present and those to come"
  37,88,He took a look and directed his attention to the stars
  37,89,"And there, he exclaimed: \"I feel really sick at heart of such irreverent society"
  37,90,They -his people- turned their backs upon him and they went away
  37,91,"Then he turned to their false gods (food was set before them) and asked them, thus: \"Do you not eat"
  37,92,"Are you mute\" he asked \"what ails you that you do not talk nor do you say something to the purpose"
  37,93,Secluded from observation he kept striking them right and left with the right hand
  37,94,"But when the damage was noticed, his people came back rushing"
  37,95,"And there said Ibrahim to them: \"Do you worship the stones and the material you carve with your own hands"
  37,96,When it is Allah Who brought you Into being together with all the elements you use in your handiwork
  37,97,"Offended as they seemed, they decided to get rid of him and so they said: \"Build for him a chamber full of combustibles and cast him into the blazing fire"
  37,98,And they thought of contriving against him but We made them the losers who lost the most
  37,99,"And there decided Ibrahim to emigrate? soul and body, spiritually and physically. He said: \"I am quitting my home land and will settle where I can best serve Allah, my Creator, Who will guide me to His path of righteousness"
  37,100,"And he prayed, thus: \"I pray and beseech You O Allah, my Creator, to grace me with a son invested with wisdom and piety"
  37,101,"And there, We intimated to him the birth of a son vested with the virtue of patience and with the attribute of nobleness which would teach him forbearance from so foul a wrong"
  37,102,"And when the son attained maturity and was able to participate in his father's divine service the father intimated to him his mystical vision. He said: \"my son I saw in my dream that I offer you up to Allah as a sacrifice and so, see what you think and what you have to say\".
