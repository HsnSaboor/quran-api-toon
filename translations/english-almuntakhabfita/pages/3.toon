quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  2,6,"As to those who deny Allah, not lifting to Him their inward sight, it is all the same to them whether you warn them O Muhammad of menacing danger and misfortune or not"
  2,7,"Allah has closed their hearts’ ears and denied them intellectual sense of hearing, and their minds' eyes grow dim as if covered with a film; they are disposed to denseness of intellect and shall suffer a fitting punishment"
  2,8,"Among people are those who pretend to believe in Allah, give credence to His Omnipotence and Authority and acknowledge the truth of the Hereafter while in fact they hug their old irreverent conviction to their hearts"
  2,9,"They apply their minds to deceiving Allah, AL-'Alim (the Omniscient), Who knows what is secretly suggested to the mind, and to deceive those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, when in fact, they only deceive themselves, failing to perceive"
  2,10,"Their ill-natured hearts reflect the morbidity inherent in their innermost being, and consequently did Allah make their seats of intellect melt away in disease and lassitude that they addicted themselves to vice, and there awaits them a fitting punishment for their intentional assertion of what is false"
  2,11,"And when told to stop making mischief on earth nor create discord, they say: \"But we only try to bring people to abandon the wrong course of life and conduct and adopt the right one till the new principle governs their thoughts"
  2,12,"Indeed, the reform they claim is nothing but a euphemism for ruin, they are composed more of mischief than ill-will, but they fail to perceive"
  2,13,"And when told to conform their will to Allah’s will and to recognise Him, believe in Him and give credence to His Omnipotence and Authority as other people have conformed to His will, they say: \"Shall we demean ourselves like the simpletons did and follow the same course they followed?\" Indeed, they are the fools who said in their hearts, \"There is no god,\" but they are ignorant and unknowing of the truth"
  2,14,"And when they are face to face with those whose hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues they declare that they have conformed their will to Allah’s will, and when they are apart with their satanic confederates who delight in satanic wickedness, they assure them of their confederacy and that they confederate in their design but they were only laughing at the believers with an outward contempt of what they esteemed sacred"
  2,15,Allah gives them plenty of rope to allow them free scope and action in order to commit themselves to the loss in a maze of error
  2,16,"These are they who have been steered by false belief and exchanged the guidance of Providence to the path of righteousness for a perplexed path in a maze of error, and in consequence their embarking in bad business and their captivation in evil trade have caused them the loss of their souls, they were captive victors who lost in gain, nor could they hit the path of righteousness"
