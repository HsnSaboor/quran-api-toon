quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  15,1,"(Alef), L. (lam) R. (Raa), the Surah opens with these letters introductory from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated. These are divine prosy discoursed verses of the Book and a perspicuous Quran which stands manifest of enlightenment and imparting knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light"
  15,2,Perhaps the Day shall come sooner than expected when those who denied Allah and disobeyed His statutes wish they had conformed to Islam as ordained by Him
  15,3,"Let them feast their senses, their thoughts and their feelings with infidelity and disobedience and experience with delight the pleasure they draw from such a disposition and be fooled by their hopes which they shall come to know and. realize that they are doomed to disappointment"
  15,4,"We never destroyed a city, a people or a nation arbitrarily but according to a justified act. There and then their end is being predetermined and unalterably decreed"
  15,5,Nor can a people or a nation hasten their own end of ultimate state earlier than the predetermined due date nor can they delay it either
  15,6,"Acting against their own best interests, they accuse the Messenger of falsehood; they mockingly say to him: \"O you who claim to have received the divine message from heaven, you are indeed insane or demoniac"
  15,7,"Why then\", they add, \"you do not bring down the angels to substantiate your claim if indeed you are declaring the truth"
  15,8,"They do not realize that We do not send down the angels to satisfy a curiosity. We only send them down for a valid reason and a just cause -to execute Allah's decrees-, and if We do send them down, the infidels shall be annihilated on the spot and no hope shall there be for respite"
  15,9,We have sent down the Quran featuring the virtuous divine message of truth which shall never suffer eclipse nor shall its spiritual power ever be on the wane and its preservation against loss and corruption is indeed Our concern
  15,10,We sent Messengers before you O Muhammad to the various sects of the distant past who were adherents of different systems of faith and worship
  15,11,And never did a Messenger present himself to them but suffered malicious mockery and was laughed to scorn
  15,12,Thus do We picture him in the minds and hearts of the sinful who grow daily more and more wicked
  15,13,"They just refuse to recognize him nor do they accept his message, notwithstanding that Allah's mode of action which has long been pursued in the past for each typical instance forming a particular case of a principle and a signal instance of punishment shall not alter"
  15,14,And if We were to open to them a gate in heaven to provide a free passage so as to admit of their continued ascent into the realm
  15,15,"They would, thus still, say: \"This is an eye trap. Our eyes have been confused with drink. In fact we have been bewitched"
