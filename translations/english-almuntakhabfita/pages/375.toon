quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,184,And keep in awe of Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him Who brought you and brought all those who came to this world into existence before you
  26,185,"But their response was pitifully unfavourable. They said to him: \" You are one of those influenced by witchcraft and therefore bewitched"
  26,186,"They added: \"you are only a mortal like us wherefore you could not be singled out for Prophethood. In fact we do think you are a pathological liar"
  26,187,"And if you are not, and you are indeed declaring the truth, then let us see if you can cause a piece of heaven to fall upon us in the form of discs of cumuli"
  26,188,"Allah, my Creator\", Shu'aib said \"is Omnipresent and He is fully cognizant of all that you do"
  26,189,They disbelieved him and refused credence to Our message wherefore were they seized with a wave of suffocating heat followed by a cumulus which overshadowed them and gave them a rainbow of hope of relief. But it was a joy in which they could not rejoice. It spoke thunder and reduced them to a useless form. It was indeed a torment that befell them on a momentous day
  26,190,This is indeed emblematic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority but most of them denied Him Who brought them into existence
  26,191,"Allah, your Creator, is indeed AL-Aziz and AL-Rahim"
  26,192,"And this Quran is indeed a disclosure of divine knowledge, wisdom and practical divinity sent down to man from Allah, the Creator of the worlds, the visible and the invisible, past, present and those to come"
  26,193,"It is brought down by Allah's errand, the faithful and honourable Holy Spirit Jibril (Gabriel)"
  26,194,Who imparted it O Muhammad to your innermost thoughts and to the repository of your consciousness so that you serve as a spectacle and a warning
  26,195,It -the Quran- is revealed in plain Arabic literary form
  26,196,And it was indeed referred to and proclaimed in the Scriptures of earlier generations
  26,197,Is it not an attestation to its credit and a ground for belief that the learned among the Children of Israel do know it is the truth
  26,198,Had We revealed it to a people -characterized with dullness of comprehension or a people slow of perception or foreign to the Arabic tongue
  26,199,"And had the prophet read it to them, they would not have understood it nor welcomed it or given credence to it"
  26,200,Thus do We picture it in the minds and hearts of the sinful who grow daily more and more wicked
  26,201,"Who shall not acknowledge it as the truth personified until they have had the wind in their faces and they are face to face with the promised punishment here, at the hands of the Muslims or with the torment laid upon the damned Hereafter"
  26,202,A punishment that surprises them and catches them unawares and reduces them to ruin
  26,203,"There and then they shall change their minds with regard to past action and conduct and express their hope which springs eternal in their breasts and say: \"can we be given respite so that we corrects all the wrongs"
  26,204,Do they mockingly and defiantly wish to hasten Our retributive punishment
  26,205,Do you see O Muhammad into what would happen if We make all grace abound in them and they enjoy it for years
  26,206,Then they are suddenly seized with what they were promised of retributive punishment
