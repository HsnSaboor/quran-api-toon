quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  21,73,And We made them leaders of faith guiding people into all truth as We willed and We inspired to them the deeds of wisdom and piety and the act of worship and alms giving. They were exclusively devoted to serving Our purpose and they worshipped Us alone
  21,74,"And to Lut, We imparted wisdom, sovereignty and divine knowledge and We rescued him and delivered him out of the town whose inhabitants established the most evil and abominable and abnormal sexual practice. They were perverse people given to shameful deeds and immorality"
  21,75,And We admitted him to the domain of Our mercy. He was one of those characterized by justice and uprightness and he was morally right

  21,81,"And to Sulayman We subdued the wind raging and blowing tempestuously to flow at his command to the blessed land We had marked with grace -his influence extended over a vast territory, Palestine, Syria, Arabia, Ethiopia,- and We were 'Alimin (Omniscient)of all things and all affairs"
