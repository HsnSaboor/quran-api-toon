quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,71,"Narrate to them O Muhammad the story of Nuh (Noah); it might bring them to their senses. He said to his people: \"My people, if you feel that my abode among you and my constant reminding you of Allah's message and of your duty to Him are annoying you and exhausting your patience, in Allah I trust and no one can stop me from doing my duty to Him. Therefore, get together with your predominant partners whom you claim to have authority over you besides Allah and decide on a course of action not objectively doubtful and fulfill it against me and give me no respite"
  10,72,"And if you counsel deaf and disregard Allah's commands, I do not charge you a price for imparting to you Allah's revelations and disclosures, wisdom and practical divinity. My reward rests at the hands of Allah and I have been commanded to be among those who conform to Islam"
  10,73,"Yet they charged him with falsehood, and by consequence We rescued him by putting him together with those who fell in line with him on board ship -The Ark- and made them the successors. We drowned those who denied Our divine Message and signs. Now look to see what was the fate of those who were warned of impending danger and misfortune and they refused to pay heed"
  10,74,"In succession, We sent Messengers, each carrying a divine message to his people. They presented them with enough signs to guide them out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment. But they would not give credence to what they had rejected aforetime. Thus do We deafen the hearts' ears of those whose thoughts thrive on disobedience and transgression"
  10,75,Subsequently We sent Mussa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) to Pharaoh and his people to present them with Our divine message imparting intellectual enlightenment and illumination. But they turned indignant and displayed inordinate self-esteem and confirmed themselves in prepensed malice and were a people steeped in crime
  10,76,They labelled the divine truth presented to them through Our Messenger Mussa necromancy displayed by a necromancer capable indeed of skilled sorcery
  10,77,"Do you people\" said Mussa, \"Call the truth presented to you, sorcery! Is this sorcery! But indeed, never shall the sorcerer be able to withstand the truth"
  10,78,"They said to Mussa: \"Did you come to us to dissuade us to disregard our fathers' system of faith and worship in order to be the distinguished above all others and the exalted in rank and station in the land! Never. Notwithstanding that we do not believe you nor do we give credence to your message"
