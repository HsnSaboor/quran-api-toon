quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By the era distinctive of life on earth
  103,2,Man suffers loss through negligence and misadventure and what his ambition is worth
  103,3,"Except those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety, who commended adherence to what is in conformity with truth and accords with reality and promoted the virtue of patience in their society"
  104,1,Woe to every scandal-monger who thrives on traducing people
  104,2,Who amasses money and multiplies it for the sake of accumulating wealth whereof reckoning it numerically gives him pleasure
  104,3,He thinks that his fortune will immortalize him forever
  104,4,"Never, but he and all that he amassed will be cast into the Hutama, a fiercely merciless fire"
  104,5,You just do not know what the Hutama is like
  104,6,It is the infernal pit of Hell fire ordained by Allah
  104,7,Which fire finds its way to the innermost being of thoughts and desire
  104,8,It is vaulted over the wicked
  104,9,In lengths of columned extended tubes
  105,1,"Did you not see into or ponder O Muhammad how Allah your Creator, dealt with the expedition which included the elephant in their train"

  105,3,He overwhelmed them with throngs of birds coming in very large flights
  105,4,"Striking them with clay stones, spreading among them an epidemic"
  105,5,Until they became like the stubbles left over in a field that has been reaped
