quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  7,196,"My tutelary guardian is Allah Who has revealed the Book, the Quran, the fountain-head of divine knowledge, wisdom and justice. He is the tutelary Protector of those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety"
  7,197,Whereas those whom you invoke besides Him shall fail forever to afford you help or help themselves
  7,198,"And if you should invoke them to offer you counsel they cannot hear you, and you can see their artificial eyes staring vacantly at you, unable to see"
  7,199,"Be indulgent O Muhammad and favour forbearance anti relaxation of restraint, and make due allowances and enjoin conformity of life and conduct to the requirements of morality disregarding the impudent who are insolently disrespectful"
  7,200,"And if AL-Shaytan entices you by suggesting divergence or discord secretly to your mind, do not consent nor be actuated, but commit yourself to Allah counter to the evil he instigated. Allah is indeed Sami'un (Omnipresent) with unlimited audition, and 'Alimun (Omniscient)"
  7,201,"Those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, always bear Allah in mind to the extent that if and when a satanic touch of evil is suggested secretly to their minds, they immediately bring religion into touch with conduct and lift to Allah their inward sight"
  7,202,Yet the satanic among the Jinn and mankind keep driving divergence by dint of repetition into the infidels' heads and simply lead the way
  7,203,"And if you do not present them with a supernatural act to satisfy their desire, they wish you would go in quest of it. Say to them: I only follow what is revealed to me by spiritual influence from Allah, my Creator; this is the Quran, the true illumination and enlightenment. It is revealed by Allah, your Creator, to open your mind's eyes and guide those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand into all truth and to confer on them Allah's mercy and blessings"
  7,204,"O you people who have conformed to Islam: When the Quran is recited, bow down your ears and listen graciously and attentively to it so that you may hopefully be recipients of Allah's mercy"
  7,205,"And bear Allah, your Creator, in your inmost thoughts and secret feelings so that the principle of thought and action, the soul, exercises devotional contemplation with humbleness and profound reverence and with bated breath at the beginning and the end of the day. Let not your innermost being be unmindful of Allah"
  7,206,"Indeed, those in heaven's realm who are in the August presence of Allah, your Creator, are not too proud to adore Him with appropriate acts and rites; they praise Him and extoll His glorious attributes and prostrate themselves to Him in veneration"
