quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,35,"And to excuse their infidelity which it is not possible to justify, the idolaters insolently say: \"Had Allah willed, neither we nor our fathers would have worshipped besides Him other gods, nor would we have enforced taboos other than those decreed by Him\" Thus much acted their predecessors. But is the Messenger really responsible for any act or a duty other than relating the divine message and the elucidation of its text"

  16,41,And those who fled their homes and homeland by reason of persecution and emigrated to where they could best serve Allah's cause shall be the recipients of His mercy and blessings.
