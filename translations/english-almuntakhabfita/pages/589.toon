quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,"Gracefully seated, the devotees will direct their eyes at Allah's light and glory and be thankful for the favourable gain"
  83,36,Now have the infidels not been requited with what is commensurate with what they did
  84,1,When once the heaven is split asunder
  84,2,In obedience to the command of its Creator and in payment of its duty to Him
  84,3,And when the earth is stretched out
  84,4,And disgorges its contents and empties itself of the dead
  84,5,In obedience to the command of its Creator and in payment of its duty to Him; there and then shall people be adjudged
  84,6,"Remember O man, you are arduously labouring and painfully toiling toward your Creator Whom you shall meet in the end"
  84,7,Then he who is given his book bearing his record in his right hand will have no cause to apprehend
  84,8,His reckoning will be gracefully conducted
  84,9,And to his people will he go back rejoicing and greatly delighted
  84,10,"But he who is given his book, bearing his record in his left hand from the back"
  84,11,Will wish he could perish
  84,12,He will suffer the blazes
  84,13,How vainly did he rejoice among his people before and disregarded the concord of this discord
  84,14,"He emphatically thought he would never return to his Creator, Whom he never recognized nor adored"
  84,15,"But in effect Allah, his Creator had kept him in view and was fully aware of his actions"
  84,16,I swear by the glow of light and display of colour in the sky at the close of the day when the sun sets
  84,17,And by the night when life closes its lids and past events come to memory and the night-eyed can see and the night wanderer wanders about and the soul roves heaven’s realm
  84,18,And by the moon at full when its entire disk is illuminated thus dispelling the darkness of the night
  84,19,"That you people shall ride from one circumstance to another and from one mode of existence to another and from a state of things, in which events stand disposed at a particular time, to another, and from one world to another; for in the actual system of things man changes, from one condition to another. He is governed by the inherent dominating power by which actions and feelings are determined"
  84,20,What then prevents them -the infidels- from justifying faith as a conviction operative on their character and will
  84,21,"When the Quran is recited to them, they neither open their hearts' ears nor their minds to stand in awe of Allah and bow to the ground in adoration"
  84,22,"No, but the infidels inherently deny the truth which they obstinately reject and the path of righteousness they tend to deviate from"
  84,23,Allah is fully cognizant of what they conceal in their hearts and what is forged in their bosoms and He knows that infidelity is their very prevalent inclination
  84,24,"Therefore, tell them O Muhammad to expect a condign punishment"
  84,25,"But not those who believed with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and with deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety; these are destined to a fortune that is elate, and they will be requited with a reward which will not abate"
