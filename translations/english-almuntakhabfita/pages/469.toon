quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,17,"In that Day-of Judgement- shall every soul be requited with what is commensurate with its qualities and its deeds. Judgement, then, is an expression of absolute justice and vindication of right by assignment of reward or punishment; and Allah is indeed swift in putting the law in executions"
  40,18,"Caution them O Muhammad; against the approaching Day of Resurrection when the hearts sink, choking the breath, the tongue and the utterance, connoting extreme fear disabling them to put their thoughts into words; there and then shall they find no friend nor an intercessor whose mediation is accepted"
  40,19,Allah knows the Obliquity of the eye and what the bosoms conceal of thoughts and feelings
  40,20,"And Allah exercises His Authority in the maintenance and the vindication of right and He requites each according to his deserts whereas those whom they invoke besides Him are incapable of administering right or justice; indeed Allah is AL-Sami (with unlimited audition), and AL-Bassir (the Vigilant Who sees all things)"
  40,21,"Have they not journeyed through the land and looked with their minds' eyes to see what was the end of those who preceded them, who were far mightier and whose diligence never wearied, They left more material indicating prosecution with activity anal perseverance; but Allah seized them with a calamity and reduced them into a useless form in requital of their iniquities, and no tutelary did they have to protect them from Him"
  40,22,"A penalty imposed on them in the train of their malicious refusal of the clear evidence of His Omnipotence and Authority presented to them by their Messengers, and in conscience did He seize them with a calamity and reduce them into a useless form; He is indeed Omnipotent, He punishes severely"
  40,23,"To this effect I may example My Omnipotence and Authority by a brief account of Mussa (Moses) whom We sent equipped with Signs, serving to demonstrate divine power ant authority"
  40,24,"He was sent to I'haraoh, Haman and Qaroon who called him a necromancer skilled in magic and a great liar"
  40,25,"And when he presented them with tile truth from heaven's realm, the truth evincing both the truth of his mission and that of his message, they decided to take vengeance on those whom they considered deluded wretches, and so they proclaimed: \"Slay the progeny of those who fell with him into line and spare their women\". But the plan devised by those who refuse to acknowledge Allah attains no end"
