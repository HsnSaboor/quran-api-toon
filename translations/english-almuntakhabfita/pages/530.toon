quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,28,"And tell them that the water is to be distributed among their number including the she-camel, and that each share falls to each in turn"
  54,29,They called upon the leader whose heart was confederate with his hand; which held the knife and disabled the she-camel by cutting her hamstring muscles
  54,30,And how painful was the punishment imposed on those who counselled deaf to admonition and mis-spent their lives and refused to acknowledge their Messenger
  54,31,And how great and direful was the one cry* We sent against them from the realm of heaven that they came to be like the bristly stubbles of grain stalks that are left in the ground
  54,32,"We made the Quran conducive to ease, facile in discourse, easy to remember and a guide to the path of righteousness, and so, is there any who will open his heart's ears and his mind's eyes"
  54,33,Similarly did the people of Lut (Lot); they disbelieved their Messenger and obstinately refused to listen to the warning against impending danger and misfortune for their heinous sin
  54,34,"Therefore, how violent was the brimstone-charged storm We directed toward them from the realm of heaven to annihilate them, excepting Lut's family whom We delivered at the latter part of the night just before it dawned"
  54,35,"For they -but not his wife- came in My grace, the efficacious grace which effects to the thankful the end for which it is given"
  54,36,"In effect Lut, earlier, had sincerely warned them of our merciless but just retribution but they doubted his warning and continued their evil practice, lured by some sinister star"
  54,37,"Even his guests- the two disguised angels- did Lut's people try to take away to seduce and induce them to surrender to their evil sin, hut We blinded their sight and We decreed thus \"This day shall they taste My merciless but just retribution for their insolent disregard of My warning"
  54,38,And in the morning We wedded them to an irretrievable and foreordained calamity
  54,39,"And as foreordained: they tasted My merciless but just retribution for their insolent disregard of My warning"
  54,40,"We made the Quran conducive to ease, facile in discourse, easy to remember and a guide to the path of righteousness; and so, is there any who will open his heart's ears and his mind's eyes"
  54,41,"Also, the people of Pharaoh received their Messengers -Mussa (Moses) and Haron (Aaron) but they met them with disrespect and resistance and they refused to listen to the warning against impending danger and misfortune"
  54,42,"And they ignored all acts of miraculous nature serving to demonstrate Divine power and authority, and so We seized them with such disasters as would be expected only from an Azizun (Almighty) and Moqtadirun (Omnipotent)"
  54,43,"Are you pagans -you Meccans- a people of a better sort than those, just mentioned, whose pride got the better of their prudence? Or do you, pagans, have assurances in some sacred Book that you are granted immunity and freedom from a liability to which the others are subjected to"
  54,44,"Or do they -the pagans- say: \"we are a society that holds together and therefore we are in a position to overcome any adversity and to triumph over misfortune"
  54,45,This host of multitudinous Pagans and idolaters shall be beaten off and put to rout
  54,46,"Further, there awaits them the foreordained unfortunate Hour when they come to judgment and indeed worse and worse, painful and grievous, is that predetermined Hour"
  54,47,"In effect the wicked, given to sin, are embodied with bewildered souls and unsound minds"
  54,48,"There shall come the Day when they are dragged on their faces and be told: \" Now, feel the unbearable sensation coming over your bodies by being cast into Hell fire"
  54,49,"Nothing do We create casually; but everything, spiritual, animate and inanimate We create according to plan indicating the relations of objects to one another, times and places of intended doings and actions, proportions and measures, disposition of parts, designs, arrangements, limitations and consequence, all in one single act"
