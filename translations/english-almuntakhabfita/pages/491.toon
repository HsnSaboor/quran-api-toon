quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  43,23,"But then, We never sent a Messenger before you O Muhammad, to a people but stood those with the riches similitude exact of your people and said: \"We have found our fathers bent on a particular system of faith and worship and in their foot steps we walk"
  43,24,"And when the Messenger said to them: \" Even if I present you with what belongs to the highest region of thought and reality and is more guiding than that you found your fathers bent on and it guides you into all truth\"? Yet they said: \"But we do not acknowledge your mission nor do we give credence to your message"
  43,25,In consequence We took just vengeance on them; and there you can see what was the end of those who denied the truth
  43,26,"You may refer O Muhammad to an aspect of Ibrahim's (Abraham) narrative when he said to his father and his people: \"I am innocent of your ills and of all those you worship"
  43,27,Except Him who brought me into being and caused me to exist; He will indeed guide me into all truth
  43,28,"A dogma he founded and he legated to his posterity and to those who would succeed him, that they may hopefully keep Allah in mind and to Him they would lift their inward sight"
  43,29,But the idolaters ignored Ibrahim's great legacy and so did their successors. Yet I made them both enjoy life until the truth has come to them at the hands of a reputable and esteemed Messenger
  43,30,"And now that they have been presented with the spirit of truth guiding them into all truth, they say: \"This is sheer sorcery and we refuse to acknowledge it"
  43,31,"And they insolently say: \"if only this Quran were revealed to a distinguished man from one of the two cities -Macca and Taif"
  43,32,"Do they distribute or apportion the grace of Allah your Creator and His mercy to whom they please! It is We Who have apportioned their livelihood among them here and allotted their sharas authoritatively that they have no choice .We promoted and exalted in rank, honour, estimation, development, power and wealth, some above others and arranged them in grades so that they render obedience and service to one another and minister to the comfort of each other. But to be a recipient of the mercy and efficacious grace of Allah. your Creator, outweighs all that you may accumulate or treasure up in life"
  43,33,"Were it not that all people, through envy, would form one conjoint body united in feeling and thought of disbelief in Allah, We would provide the homes of those who deny Allah AL-Rahman with ceilings and roofs of silver as well as stairs of silver by which to ascend"
