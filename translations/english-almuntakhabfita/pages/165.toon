  7,123,"There, Pharaoh said to them: \"Have you yielded to his claims and surrendered yourselves to his Allah without my permission!\" Indeed\", he added, \"This is a skilful deceit designed to outwit the inhabitants of the city to drive them out from hence, and in consequence you shall come to know how heavily you shall pay for this"
  7,124,"I will amputate your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will have you all crucified"
  7,125,"Gladly\", they said to Pharaoh, \"We welcome your decision which shall haste us unto Allah Who confers on us the glorious privilege of martyrs"
  7,126,"And they added: \"Do you take vengeance on us just because we have acknowledged the signs of Allah when they were presented to us indicating clearly Allah's Omnipotence and Supremacy and because we asserted to the spirit of truth guiding into all truth!\".

He apportions it as a heritage to whom He will of His servants, and the happy outcome falls to those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him"
