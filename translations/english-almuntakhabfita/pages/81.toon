quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  4,20,"And if any of you decides to dissolve his marriage contract with his wife in favour of matrimonial union with another, and you had dowered your divorcee when you joined in wedlock with a talent of gold, you shall not recover the least part of it; would you reclaim what is their right by fraud and dishonesty and you stand manifest of deceit and falsehood"
  4,21,And how could you reclaim it when you have already entered into matrimony and communion with one another and your vows and solemn promise of allegiance and good will have been pledged to them before Allah
  4,22,"And do not marry the women whom your fathers (deceased or divorced) have married before; Allah shall drop into oblivion what happened in the past. This incestuous union has been regarded by Allah as-an immoral act, a degrading vice and an evil line of conduct"
  4,23,"Forbidden are : your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal and maternal aunts, your nieces on the brother and sister's side, your foster - mothers, your foster- sisters, your mothers - in - law, your step -daughters with whose mothers you have consummated marriage, but you are absolved to marry them if you have annulled your unconsummated marriage to their mothers -your daughters-in- law whose husbands are your own sons who generated from your own loins. Nor can you effect a, matrimonial union with two sisters at the same time; bygone shall be bygone; the new era shall begin; indeed Allah has always been Ghafurun (Forgiving) and Rahimun"
