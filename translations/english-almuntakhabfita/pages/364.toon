quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,44,"Or do you think that most of them open their hearts' ears or their minds' eyes! they are like cattle, in fact even worse, for the only path they see is that leading to the loss in the maze of errors"
  25,45,"Do you not see how Allah, your Creator, prolonged and lengthened the shadow of any object intercepting the sun or other luminary! Had He willed He would have made it still, and We made the sun the indication asserting the phenomenon, its presence and its dimensions"
  25,46,And then We reduce it to a smaller compass and make it gradually disappear - having been made to contract and vanish by the same invisible hand that made it and creaked it
  25,47,"And He is it Who made the night a vestment, and black was the colour chosen to absorb all light and sleep -the medicine to weariness and the repairer of decay- a repose -which if profound suggests death- and We made the day a phase of revival and resurrection of activity"
  25,48,"And it is He Who sends forth the winds as a forerunner of His mercy heralding a joyful event, -rain, vegetation, fertilization- and We send down from the floor of the vault of heaven pure fresh water"
  25,49,Fresh water- with which We revive the dead land of a given town and supply drinking-water to the living among Our creation including cattle and a great many human beings
  25,50,"And We dispersed it among the whole so that they apply their hearts to wisdom and their remembrance to Allah. But most people decline to choose but ungratefulness, disobedience and infidelity"
  25,51,And had We willed We would have sent to the people of every town a spectacle and a warning
  25,52,"Therefore, do not yield O Muhammad to the infidels and wage against them spiritual warfare by the divine means -the Quran- But should they wage war against you, then fight back by physical means"
  25,53,"And He is it Who sent the waters of the two seas flowing together, one fresh and sweet and the other salty and bitter and between both He installed an invisible partition which serves as an impassable barrier (the fresh water floats above the salty and there are laws that govern the separation and the depth)"
  25,54,"And He is it Who brought into being, out of a watery liquid*, a human and made him evolve lineal descent and join affinity with others, and Allah, your Creator, has always been Qadirun (Omnipotent)"
  25,55,And yet they -some people- adore besides Allah with appropriate acts and rites those who do not profit them nor harm them. But the infidel has always been a physical and spiritual help corroborating and substantiating disobedience to Allah and advocating the evil practiced by AL-Shaytan and by those with characteristics befitting him
