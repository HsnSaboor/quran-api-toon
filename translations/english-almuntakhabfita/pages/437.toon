quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  35,19,"They are not esteemed alike: those who lack intellectual, moral and spiritual perception and those who perceive mentally and apprehend the truth by thought"
  35,20,"Nor do they compare: the abysm of darkness and/or want of spiritual and intellectual sight and the illumination and enlightenment and the emanation of light"
  35,21,"Nor are they of a like nature: \"the shade\" affording coolness and the sun radiating heat"
  35,22,Nor do the living -a life deserving the name- and the dead physically or spiritually compare. Allah's voice reaches whom He will but your voice O Muhammad shall never reach those deposited in the graves
  35,23,You arc only a spectacle and a warning
  35,24,"We have sent you with the spirit of truth guiding into all truth and never was there a nation but had a Messenger, a spectacle and a warning"
  35,25,"And if they -the infidels- do reject the divine message and accuse you of falsehood and regard you as someone who passes himself off as someone other than he is, then you must realize that similarly acted those who preceded them They received Messengers with the divine message carrying evidence sufficient enough to establish their authority to implement Our statutes and Our Scriptures as well as the Book of enlightenment and illumination"
  35,26,"In consequence, did I cast them from a position of prosperity and power and brought them to ruin and how unbearable and befitting was the retribution"
  35,27,"Do you not sec that Allah sends down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain water causing the fruits to spring up from the soil in various colours. He made in the mountains paths, natural roads, passages and tracks of varied hues: white and red of various shades and others of raven black (each reflecting the colour of the dominant mineral its rocks contain)"
  35,28,"And of people, reptilian and cattle variegation also holds true. Thus, such of Allah's servants as stand in awe of Him are the savants. Allah is Azizun (Almighty) and Ghafurun (Forgiving)"
  35,29,"Indeed, those who recite Allah's Book -to themselves or to an audience- - from memory or by reading and in an appropriate manner- and observe their act of worship and do spend of what We bestowed on them of Our bounty in Allah's cause and in benevolence secretly and openly must expect a satisfying return for the commerce they have between Allah and themselves and in their intercourse in the affairs of life"
  35,30,"This is to satisfy their needs, to reward them with what is commensurate with their deeds and to make His grace abound in them, He is indeed Ghafurun and Shakurun (Thankful)"
