quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  42,23,"This is the happy announcement Allah proclaims to His worshippers whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety. Say to them O Muhammad: \"I do not ask you for anything in return except the affection and good disposition toward Allah and His Messenger as well as toward your kin so that you get nearer to Him and win His grace and mercy. And who so crowns a deed with equity Allah shall reward him with what runs higher than what corresponds to his equitable deed. Allah is indeed Gafurun (Forgiving); and Shakurun (He acknowledges what is esteemed a worthy deed)"
  42,24,"Or do they say: \"He -Muhammad- has related to Allah what he has fabricated and fraudulently imitated!\" But if Allah has determined that you Muhammad misrepresent Him, He would have blocked searching's of your heart; and if it be His will He would compose your heart with patience to endure their false and slanderous accusation. But Allah effaces and blots out falsehood and endorses and ratifies the truth by His words which to His acts accord; He is Alimun of all private thoughts and feelings reposted in the bosom"
  42,25,"He is it Who accepts repentance of those of His worshippers who in lowliest plight repentant stood and forgives their sins, and He is Cognizant (Omniscient) of all that you do"
  42,26,"He grants the prayer and fulfills the wish of those whose hearts reflect, the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety Moreover a provision of His bounty is made for the augmentation of what accords to their request with circumspection. But those who deny Him shall be put to the torment"
  42,27,"If Allah were to give livelihood generously and liberally to all His creatures and to confer support gratuitously, they would be apt to run riot on earth and transgress the goal. But He sends down to the extent He prescribes as He will; He is Khabirun (Omniscient), and Bassirun (Whose constant vigilance is extended to all His creatures)"
  42,28,He is it Who sends down the rain lo revive the land and causes it to bear crops after people have been pined with hunger and with drought and have nursed despair;* He extends His mercy and spreads it so that it be felt; He is the Tutelary Provider of tutelary care; it is He to whom are extolled the glorious attributes
  42,29,"Among the visible signs and the marvels, displaying Omnipotence and Authority is His creation of the heavens and the earth** and the beings He scattered over them and the power to gather them and bring them all together when He will"
  42,30,And whatever befalls you of a misfortune or weds you of a calamity is a consequence of your wrongful and unclean hands. Yet He ignores many offences and forgives you a great deal
  42,31,"Nor will you be able to render punishment here ineffectual nor can you frustrate His end or the laws and statutes of His realm; and besides Allah, no one can accord you tutelary care nor can any one afford you help"
