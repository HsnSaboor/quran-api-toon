quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  27,45,And We sent to Thamud -the Thamudites- their brother Saleh to exhort them to pay low submissive reverence for Allah but they were divided among themselves into two parties occasioning disputes against each other leading to hostile feeling and action
  27,46,"He -Saleh- said to them -to those who disbelieved him and challenged his warnings-: \"O my people, Why do you defiantly wish evil be hastened on rather than good! If only you invoke Allah's forgiveness He might hopefully extend His mercy to you"
  27,47,"But they wickedly said: \"We esteem you and those with you as birds of evil omen presaging some direful events.\" \"Indeed,\" he said, \"events portending good or evil and all that is destined to happen rest at the hands of Allah; the fact is that you are people put to the test"
  27,48,"Among the leaders in Saleh’s town were nine men whose wickedness exceeded all limits and reached an irreversible degree, they flourished at spreading mischief in the land and at creating discord"
  27,49,"They mutually agreed and resolved under oath (their kind of oath) to launch an attack upon him -Saleh- and his people by night to finish them off and rid the town of them and then declare their innocence to his next of kin and insist on their statement, thus: \"We\", they would say, \"were never present at the scene of the massacre of his people and this is the truth"
  27,50,"And with cleverness in circumventing, they had recourse to stratagem and in Our plan We also had recourse to stratagem which they failed to perceive"
  27,51,And now look at the fatal consequences of their cunning. We simply reduced them together with their people to a useless form
  27,52,And you can see how their dwellings stand dilapidated over hills of ruin as a sequel to their iniquities. This is emblematic indeed of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority and a significant sign appreciated by people who comprehend
  27,53,And We saved those of his people whose hearts reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues and entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah
  27,54,"And in a similar manner did We deal with the people of Lut who said to them: \"O my people, do you commit such an immorality as is contrary to the general inherent character and moral constitution when you discern what is moral from that which is morally evil"
  27,55,"Certainly\" he continued, \"you have sensuous desire for men in lieu of women; you are a people who are indeed ignorant and indeed impudent, a people who have no shame of their sins"
