quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,9,"You implored Allah's aid with touching entreaties and Allah responded favourably, thus: \"I will\", He said: \"uphold you with one thousand angels in sets succeeding one another"
  8,10,"We voiced this spiritual support to give you people mental comfort and joyful tidings and make your hearts return to their settled calmness, Indeed, victory comes only by the help of Allah Who is AL-Aziz (the Almighty), and Hakimun (Wise)"
  8,11,"And there did Allah replace the emotion of sorrow and grief which was caused by fear of the unpredictable outcome by peace of mind and sense of security thus inducing your eyes to take themselves to slumber. He sent down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain - water to free you people from foreign matter as well as from moral and spiritual pollution and from the incitement of evil instigated by AL-Shaytan (Satan) and by those with characteristics befitting Him, and to do your hearts good and set your feet firm"
  8,12,"There and then did Allah, your Creator, inspire the angels. Thus: \" I am acting with you\", Allah said: \"and so support the cause of those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and sustain them spiritually and help them take a firm position and set their feet firm\". \"I will inspire terror\", Allah added, \"in the hearts of those who are given to disbelief; strike them above the necks and strike their finger tips, their weak limbs and their failing joints"
  8,13,This train of events succeeding one another were occasioned on account of their hostility to Allah and to His Messenger; and he who is hostile to Allah and His Messenger shall realize that Allah punishes severely indeed
  8,14,"This is it you infidels, but that is not all; there awaits you the torment to be laid on the damned"
  8,15,"O you who have conformed to Islam: \"If you happen to meet with the infidels -the enemy to your faith- and you see they are marshaled for fighting you, do not turn your backs upon them nor reverse your course or retreat"
  8,16,"And he who turns his back, reverses his course or retreats, unless it be a stratagem for gaining advantage over the enemy or for falling back on other troops projected and directed as the larger military movement and operation of the campaign, will have come within the measure of Allah's wrath and be destined to the abode in Hell, and how evil is the destination"
