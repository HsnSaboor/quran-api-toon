quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,"And furnish me O Allah, my Creator, with a civil tongue uttering the truth that guides into all truth and is believed among posterity"
  26,85,And if you destine me I will be one of those inheriting the Garden of the supreme bliss and blessedness
  26,86,"And extend O Allah my Creator, Your mercy and forgiveness lo my father who was lost in the maze of error\". (A prayer invoked by Ibrahim before he realized that his father was an enemy to Allah)"
  26,87,And do not confound me nor occasion me to fall from grace in Day of Judgement
  26,88,The Day when neither wealth nor progeny shall be of advantage
  26,89,"Except him who comes to the audience of Allah with his heart in its right place, heartened or filled with devotion"
  26,90,This is the Day when Paradise shall be brought quite near to these in whose hearts reigned piety
  26,91,And Hell is projected for those who were led by the nose to the maze of error and spent their days in vanity
  26,92,"They shall be asked: \"Where now are those you revered and adored with appropriate acts and rites"
  26,93,"The gods you revered and venerated besides Allah!\" Do they afford you help or can they even help themselves"
  26,94,There and then shall they -the infidels- be cast in Hell headlong one batch after another along with those who wasted their days in vanity
  26,95,And added to them shall be those who served Iblis AL-Shaytan (Satan) all into one gathering and in one place
  26,96,"And when all have been thronged -in Hell- and have exchanged angry altercation, they -the infidels- shall express their thoughts in words"
  26,97,"By Allah\", they say, \"we wandered indeed from the path of rectitude and were lost in the maze of error"
  26,98,"We have equalized you -false gods- with Allah, Creator of the worlds"
  26,99,"And they add:\" no one led us by the nose to the maze of error but the wicked who were given to sin and steeped in crime"
  26,100,"And now\", they will exclaim, \"no one can defend us nor shall we find intercessors who would interpose on our behalf"
  26,101,Nor do we find one who is joined to us in mutual benevolence and intimacy
  26,102,"If only\", they say, \"we could be given another chance of life below we would be among those who exercise low submissive obeisance to Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him"
  26,103,This is indeed emblematic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority but most of them deny Allah Who brought them into existence
  26,104,"Allah, your Creator, is indeed AL-Aziz and AL-Rahim"
  26,105,"Just as averse were the people of Nuh, they declined to accept Allah's message basically the same message conveyed by all the Messengers of Allah before and after Nuh, therefore he who rejects Nuh's message has in fact rejected all Allah's messengers and they suspected the Messengers of falsehood"
  26,106,"Their brother Nuh said to them: \"Will you not keep in awe of Allah, your Creator, and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him"
  26,107,"I come to you\", he added, \"with a message Allah has entrusted to me and here do I relate it to you in honour and sincerity"
  26,108,A message exacting your reverence for Allah and obedience to me
  26,109,"I do not\", he said, charge you a price for imparting to you Allah's disclosures of divine knowledge, wisdom and practical divinity. My reward rests in the hands of Allah, the Creator of the worlds, the visible and the invisible, past, present and those to come"
  26,110,And so revere Him and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him and obey me
  26,111,"They said to Nuh: \"Shall we submit to you or believe in you and conform to your desire when it is only the contemptible who espoused your cause"
