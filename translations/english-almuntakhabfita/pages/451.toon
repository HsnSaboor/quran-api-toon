quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,But they counselled deaf and accused him of falsehood and by consequence they shall have much to answer for in Day of Judgement
  37,128,But excluded from that ill-fate shall be Allah's votaries who were faithful to Him and sincere in mind and spirit
  37,129,And We praised his name to fame that he be honoured by those to come of future and later generations
  37,130,Peace be unto Eliaseen -from Allah and His angels- and hailed shall he be with reverential salutations among succeeding generations
  37,131,"For, thus do We requite those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence and imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety"
  37,132,He was one of Our votaries whose purpose was the heart of Our purpose
  37,133,And We chose Lut and We sent him to his people as a spectacle and a warning and entrusted him with Our divine message
  37,134,We saved him and delivered him together with his family and those of his people who fell into line with him and from the irretrievable disaster
  37,135,Except an old woman -his wife- who was left behind to perish in the general ruin
  37,136,And We reduced all the others to a useless form
  37,137,And you -people- go by their ruined dwellings and you evidence the fatal consequence by day
  37,138,And you do evidence them also by night and so can you not reflect
  37,139,And so was Yunus; he was one of Our Messengers whom We entrusted with Our divine message
  37,140,"He withdrew from his people, -with whom he grew impatient- and without Allah's instructions, he hurriedly fled them and went aboard a fully laden ship"
  37,141,He participated in casting lots and the lot fell on him and he was the one rejected and thrown overboard
  37,142,And there he was swallowed by the fish and it was him who had incurred the blame
  37,143,Had he not been one of those who in lowliest plight repentant stood and constantly praised Allah and extolled His glorious attributes
  37,144,He would have remained burried in that grave -the belly of the fish- till Resurrection
  37,145,And We made the fish regurgitate him in the open on the desert shore feeble and sickly
  37,146,"We caused a tree to grow over him for protection, a tree which grew decumbently and straggingly to a considerable length so as to rest upon the ground (possibly some kind of pumpkin)"
  37,147,And when recovered We sent him as a spectacle and a warning to a people who numbered one hundred thousand or more
  37,148,And his mission was accepted with the consenting minds of the whole who conformed their will to Allah's will and by consequence We made them enjoy life up to a predetermined point of time
  37,149,"And now ask them -the infidels- O Muhammad and question the truth of their dictum: \"Has Allah chosen as they irreverently alleged the females and left for them the males"
  37,150,Or did We create the angels females and they bore witness to their creation and therefore they have ground for their belief
  37,151,"Indeed their perversion of facts and their intentional assertion of falsehood induced them to falsify the words, wittingly, endeavouring to attain their blasphemous and irreverent object, namely"
  37,152,"Allah has begotten a son\" and make it seem divine which is not. They are indeed pathological liars who lie in their teeth and commit errors at the grossness of which common sense revolts"
  37,153,Did He exercise choice and He preferred daughters to sons
