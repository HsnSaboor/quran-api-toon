quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  27,64,And Who is he Who starts creation and repeats it and creates and recreates who provides you with your livelihood from heaven above you and from the earth below you! Is it another god with Allah! If so then produce your evidence if indeed you're declaring the truth
  27,65,"Say to them O Muhammad: \"No one ever knows the hidden, the unknown and the unseen nor what the future holds in the heavens and on earth but Allah alone and never do they know when they shall be resurrected to face judgement"
  27,66,"No, but their knowledge of the Hereafter has reached a dead-lock giving occasion to uncertainty. No, but their doubt stands as the beacon of the unwise, in fact, their notion of the Hereafter has fallen on the blind spot"
  27,67,"And yet the infidels still say: \"Do you mean that after we and our fathers have been reduced to dust, we; can be resurrected"
  27,68,"We\" they add, \"have been promised that before and so have our fathers; this is indeed nothing but fables of old"
  27,69,"Say to them O Muhammad: \"Journey the land and open your minds' eyes to see for yourselves the fatal consequence which united all those who persisted in crime"
  27,70,"And do not be grieved at heart for their denial of the divine message nor for their hearts which dare rise defiant against Allah, nor should you be sorely distressed on account of their cunning which they take for a sinister and crooked wisdom"
  27,71,"And in their challenge to the occurrence of punishment they say: \" When will that promised punishment come to pass if indeed you are declaring the truth"
  27,72,"Say to them O Muhammad: \"It is hoped that some of what you have been promised and wish it be hastened on may overtake you now"
  27,73,"Indeed, the grace of Allah, your Creator, abounds in people but most of them show indisposition to acknowledge His bounty and display want of gratitude"
  27,74,"Allah, your Creator is Omniscient indeed of all that is reposited in their breasts of private thoughts and feelings and of all that they conceal and He is Alimun of all that they reveal"
  27,75,"And nothing of the unknown, the unseen or the hidden in the heavens or on earth but is recorded in the archetypal book"
  27,76,"Indeed this Quran tells the Children of Israel plenty, and informs them of the truth of most of the subject matter which set them at variance"
