quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When once the heaven is cleaved asunder
  82,2,And the planets are scattered
  82,3,And the seas are overflown and gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore
  82,4,And the graves are turned upside down and their contents are discharged and ejected
  82,5,There and then shall every soul become aware of what it did in its early chapter of life and what it did of late
  82,6,"O man! what has enticed you to be audacious and disloyal to Allah, your Creator, the. Most Beneficent"
  82,7,"Who created you and proportioned you and gifted you with interdependent systems to make you an organized whole, and in the upright position* He made you efficient"
  82,8,"In whatever form He wills, He shapes you; not to mention, complete defective or deficient"
  82,9,"No, but you refuse to acknowledge Allah and do not admit the truth of the Day of Judgement"
  82,10,"Yet, in point of fact you are watched by guardian angels who do not recede"
  82,11,They are honourable Scribes
  82,12,Who know and record every deed
  82,13,The virtuous shall surely be destined to the heavenly bliss
  82,14,The wicked shall surely be in the fiercely blazing abyss
  82,15,"A fate, they will suffer in Day of Judgement"
  82,16,They shall not be delivered therefrom nor are they given relief
  82,17,You just do not know what the Day of Judgement is like
  82,18,"Indeed, you just do not know what the Day of Judgement is like"
  82,19,"It is the Day when no soul can avail another nor is there a. safe path to strike, for the full command there and then belongs entirely to Allah"
  83,1,Woe are those who fraudulently scant the measure
  83,2,When they buy from people they insist on a full measure that will not abate
  83,3,And when they sell to them they fraudulently scant the measure or the weight
  83,4,Do they not think they will be resurrected
  83,5,On a great and eventful Day
  83,6,A Day when all people shall rise and stand before Allah the Creator of the worlds
