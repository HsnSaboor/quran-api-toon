  21,83,"And Ayub (Job) who invoked Allah, his Creator, for relief. He said: \"O Allah, my Creator, I have suffered long lasting tribulation and You are the Most Merciful of all who show mercy"
  21,84,"And We responded favourably to his invocation and relieved him and freed it him from all tribulation and We compensated to him a progeny to replace those he had lost .We doubled their number (grand children), a mercy extended to him from Us and a great event to be happily remembered by those who are constant"
  21,85,"Also Ismail, Idris -possibly Ozoris- and Zut-kifl -Dhoukefl-, possibly - Ezchiel each of whom faced hardship and tribulations with perseverance, patience and endurance"

  21,87,"And Zun-nun -Yunus-, who met the opposition of the people to whom he was sent with impatience. Moved by anger he renounced them and left them thinking that We would not reprove him for such a behaviour. -He went on board ship and in the crossing it was decided by the crew that he was one too many and must be got rid of-. In the sea he was swallowed by the fish wherein he was constrained. In the depth of darkness he called on Allah and invoked His mercy, he said: \"O Allah, there is no Ilah but You, glory be to You and extolled are Your glorious attributes. I have been rongful of actions"

When it comes to inheritance You are indeed the Only and the best heir Who shall inherit the whole and all in all"
  21,90,"We responded to him favourably and bestowed on him Yahya ( John), having rendered his wife fruitful. These were people who hastened to doing all that is good, useful, reliable for a purpose, efficient in function and in pursuit of faith, and they invoked Us expressing their due affectionate devotion keeping in awe of Us and hopeful of Our mercy, and they humbled themselves before Us and were indeed submissive to Us alone"
