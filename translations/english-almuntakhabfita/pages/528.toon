  53,46,And that He derived these two sex divisions of organic beings from the male seed (Notfa) when emitted
  53,47,And that it is He who shall effect the second creation when He restores the dead to life for judgment at the Last Day
  53,48,"And that He it is who gives possessions and abundant means; He makes people abound in wealth or natural resources, and it is He Who enriches man with heavenly grace or contents by the fulfillment of a desire or the supply of a want, and it is He Who effects the satisfaction and contented state of mind"
  53,49,And that He is it Who is the Creator of the dog star (the Sirius)
  53,50,And that it was He Who annihilated the ancient most powerful earlier generations of the people of 'Ad -the first Adites- and raised their cities to the ground
  53,51,And likewise did He annihilate the strong and talented people of Thamud (the Thamudites) and left not one survivor
  53,52,"And before them did He blot out of existence the people of Nuh (Noah) who never observed the principles of justice and were most disposed to be obstinately contrary to what is true, and continued to go counter to what is reasonable or required"
  53,53,And it was He Who brought to ruin and reduced to impotence the cities old Sodom and Gomorrah
  53,54,To a degree inconceivable in imagination as to how they were berried the way they were
  53,55,"Therefore, which of your Creator's attributes, O man, gives you occasion to uncertainty and makes you undecided in belief"

  53,57,The inevitable Day of Judgment is drawing near
  53,58,And no one but Allah can open up its point of time to the knowledge of the people
  53,59,Does this discourse affect your emotion you people and excite your wonder
  53,60,"And you laugh to scorn and manifest contempt, instead of weeping out your eyes and your hearts"
  53,61,"And you express disapproval and decline to accept the message, searching hard for an error to help you refute your Messenger"

  54,1,"The final hour, (that is the Day of Judgment), is drawing near and the moon will be cleft asunder, lose orbit and be disrupted"
  54,2,"Yet whenever they see an act of a miraculous nature serving to demonstrate Divine power, and omnipotence, authority and ground for belief, they look upon it as a secret and overmastering influence intended to shake their beliefs and they assert emphatically that such magic as the Messenger enchants them by, is doomed to failure and his hopes will be doomed to disappointment"
  54,3,They denied the truth when it was presented to them and treated the Messenger as one who passes himself off as someone other than he is and they followed their own lustful course and a religion of a sensuous character. But every event has its determined time and place

  54,6,Pay no attention to them O Muhammad; there shall come the day of the horrendous Event when the announcer among the angels intimates to them the painful and disturbing news of the unwelcome occurrence of the imminent judicious hearing and judgment
