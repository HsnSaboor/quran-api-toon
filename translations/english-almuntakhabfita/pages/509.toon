quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"And those who have conformed to Islam say: \" If only a Surah (Chapter) be revealed ordaining war against those who deny Allah (or Jihad in His cause)!\" yet when a Surah is revealed wherein Allah does not play with metaphor but He comes to the point, then you see those whose hearts melt away in disease and lassitude look toward you with a countenance standing similitude exact of someone who has fallen into a fainting fit in conflict with the encounter with death and it serves them right"
  47,21,"Willing obedience coupled with words expressing desire for action should have been their response and when Allah's command comes about, then if their actions to their words accord, it would be more advantageous to them"
  47,22,"And if you people fail to obey Allah's command, then do you have in mind, as a fixed purpose, to make mischief and create discord on earth and break the ties of a common blood and of uterine consanguinity"
  47,23,such persons are those whom Allah has afflicted with such evils as indicate a malignant fate and has deafened their hearts' ears and blinded their minds' eyes
  47,24,Do they not ponder and meditate upon the Quran or do they keep locks upon their hearts
  47,25,"Those apostates who have renounced Faith in favour of disbelief after the spirit of truth has guided them into all truth, were victims of Al-Shytan (Satan) who took advantage of them, instigated them and suggested to their minds heavenly shows thereby staking their very lives on very dark hopes"
  47,26,"AL-Shytan took advantage of them when they consented to help those who held all that Allah has revealed in a very strong dislike and cherished hatred to His revealed religion; they said to them: \" we will obey you in some respects, \" (namely: to carry on underhand plotting and to plan some actions to attain the desired end, and to employ secret influence for the accomplishment of set designs), but Allah knew what their hearts forged that their tongues must vent"
  47,27,How will they react when the angels of death besiege them all about to disembody their souls and descend violently upon them striking their faces and their backs
  47,28,"So be it, because they practiced the vices incidental to paganism and hypocrisy: disobedience, intrigues and vices which Allah detests and has forbidden. They allied themselves to the enemies of Allah and His Messenger and bore malice to every propitious action that pleases Allah and so He Imprinted their deeds with irreverence, profanity and damnation"
  47,29,"Or do these people, whose hearts reflect the morbidity inherent in their innermost being, think that Allah will not expose their malicious feelings"
