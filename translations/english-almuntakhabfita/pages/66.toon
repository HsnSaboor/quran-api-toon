quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  3,122,"Then two of your tribes almost lost heart. However, they were saved by the graceful tutelage of Allah, and in Allah should those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand put their trust"
  3,123,"The Battle of Badr ought to have taught you abhorrence of want of faith and lack of discipline. Allah has made victory sit on your helm even though you were an insignificant humble force out of heart. Therefore, revere Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him so that you may hopefully impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude"
  3,124,"You Muhammad told your faithful troops, who were confronted with an unexpected situation and thought they were affronting death, to lift up their hearts and their morale. You said to them: \"Is it not enough for you that Allah, your Creator, upholds you with an array of three thousand angels specially dispatched from heaven's realm to support your cause"
  3,125,Indeed if you exercise patience and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah you shall be able to do battle against your enemy. Should you be taken by surprise and be suddenly attacked you shall receive Allah’s aid; He shall uphold you with an array of five thousand angels emblematic of onslaught
  3,126,"Such an announcement of Allah’s aid was meant to be cheerful news to raise your spirits and to ease your anguish of a torturing hour and make you rest assured of victory. It should have made you realize that victory and the position of supremacy and superiority are an attribute and an act of Allah, AL- Aziz and AL-Hakim"
  3,127,"Allah ordained this course of events. He purposed to strike a part of the evil group of infidels at the root and so with one single blow would they be severed, or to disgrace them and enrage their blood and put them into such a commotion that would precipitate their humiliation and defeat"
  3,128,It is none of your concern nor is it the concern of your people O Muhammad whether Allah reduces your enemy's number and their land or the extent of their power and wealth or whether He effects their defeat or relents and pardons their offence or requites them with retributive punishment. They are a wrongful people
  3,129,To Allah belong all that is in the Heavens and all that is on Earth. He forgives whom He will and punishes whom He will. Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun
  3,130,"O you who have conformed to Islam! Usury is incompatible with religion. Do not swallow voraciously whatever interest you can get for the money you lend, doubling and redoubling the interest as you go. Revere Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him so that heaven may prosper you"
  3,131,And save yourselves the Fire especially prepared for those who disobey Allah’s commands
  3,132,Obey Allah and His Messenger so that you may come to be recipients of His mercy
