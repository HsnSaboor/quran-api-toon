quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  12,5,"His father expressed his thoughts in words with grace divine imbued; he said to him: \"My son, relate not your vision to your brothers -half brothers- lest they plot against you and entice you into danger: actuated by envy, they may fall as puppets in the hands of AL-Shaytan (Satan) who is indeed an avowed enemy to man"
  12,6,"Thus\", he continued, \"will Allah, your Creator, choose you and impart to you the knowledge of interpreting visions and sense impressions in sleep and what they prefigure of future events, He complements his bounty and munificence to you and to the progeny of Ya'qub as much as He made all grace abound in your grandfathers Ibrahim (Abraham) and Ishaq (Isaac) before. Allah, your Creator is indeed 'Alimun (Omniscient) and Hakimun (Wise)"
  12,7,"Indeed, there have been in the story of Yusuf and his brothers an instructive occurrence, an example, a warning and a lesson for those who are seeking the world and its pursuits as well as for those who are in search of the truth and spiritual knowledge"
  12,8,"Conspiring against him, the brothers said: \"Yusuf and his brother -full brother, Benjamin- are indeed nearer to our father's heart and closer to his affection than we are, our father stands indeed manifest of error; he manifests forth a straying mind"
  12,9,"They settled the question and pronounced judgment: \"Remove Yusuf out of the way\" they said, \"either by death or by taking him away to some distant land, and thereafter you stand in lowliest plight repentant to Allah of your evil deed and characterize yourselves with righteous living"
  12,10,"But one of them said: \"Do not kill Yusuf, for such an act shall be a grave error that threatens a fatal result; throw him down the well where he would be out of sight, and there, he will be picked up by some company of merchants, travellers or others, that is if you have indeed decided to get rid of him"
  12,11,"And so, they asked their father: \"Our father, why do you not trust us for the care of Yusuf! Our first wish in life is for his happiness and welfare"
  12,12,"Send him with us tomorrow\", they said, \"to enjoy himself, to eat and drink in a picnic fashion and to take part in a game affording him pleasure, and we will take care of him and see that he is not exposed to danger"
  12,13,"It grieves me at heart to part with him,\" said the father \"especially when I have an uneasy sense of the probability of the boy being brutally assailed and devoured by a wolf at a moment when you are oblivious of him it"
  12,14,"They protested, thus: \"If this be true\"t, they said, \"and the wolf were to devour him when we are a collective mass of men, then we will have incurred privation of attributes and it would be a lost sorrow to wail our fall"
