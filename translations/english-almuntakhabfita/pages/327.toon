quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  21,58,"And so he reduced them -the idols- into a useless form except their biggest, so that they might turn to it for information"
  21,59,"And when they returned, they exclaimed: \"He who has done this to our gods is indeed wrongful of actions"
  21,60,"Some of them said: \"we heard a young man by the name of Ibrahim cursing them and calling them names"
  21,61,"Bring him here before the people\", they said, \"so that they may witness with their own eyes the consequence, for he -Ibrahim- has much to answer for"
  21,62,"And when he was brought over, they asked him: \"Was it you Ibrahim who did this to our gods"
  21,63,"But it was their chief who did it\", Said Ibrahim; ask them if they are able to talk"
  21,64,"And there, they blamed themselves saying: \"You are indeed the wrongful of actions"
  21,65,"But, overturned by imprudence in their minds and by subversion of reason, they said to him: \"You knew very well that these idols do not talk"
  21,66,"Do you worship besides Allah,\" ask Ibrahim, \"objects neither profit you nor can do you harm"
  21,67,Fie on you and on those objects you worship besides Allah; can you not think in a sensible and logical manner and employ the faculty of reason in forming conclusions
  21,68,"Nevertheless\", they said, \"burn him and uphold your gods if indeed you intend to maintain our system of faith and worship and sustain it against criticism"
  21,69,"We said: \"O fire! be cool and maintain your coolness and afford Ibrahim safety and security\" and We graced him with peace of mind"
  21,70,"So conditioned, they thought of contriving against him, but We made them the losers who lost the most"
  21,71,And We rescued him together with Lut (Lot). -his nephew- and delivered them to the land We had blessed -Aram or Syria and Can'an or Palestine- the land where many divine messages were revealed for all
  21,72,And We bestowed on him Ishaq (Isaac) and in addition We graced him with Ya'cob (Jacob) -a grand son- each of whom We characterized by virtue and righteousness
