quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  46,6,"and when mankind are thronged before Allah for judgment, they shall see those whom they invoked here are at enmity with them Hereafter, they shall contemptuously refuse to acknowledge their supplication"
  46,7,"Yet when Our evident and plain revelations are related to them and Our signs are clearly indicated and pointed out, then those who deny Allah label the truth presented to them as falsehood and say: \"This is only sorcery assumed by him - the Messenger"
  46,8,"Or do they say: \"He -Muhammad- has forged it \" Say to them: \" if I have forged it; what good does it do me, and if I did as you unjustly claim, then who on earth can defend me from Allah and vindicate my cause ? \" Allah knows best your minds which strive laboriously for some evil end; but enough is Allah to be a witness of my actions and of your actions and He is AL-Gafur and AL-Rahim (the Forgiving and the Merciful)"
  46,9,"Say to them: \"I am not a novelty of Apostleship hither to unknown to you nor do I know what is to be or will be, nor what is in store for me or for you . I only submit to what is inspired to me by Allah and do what I am commanded to do, and I am only a spectacle and a warning"
  46,10,"Say to them \" What if this Book -the Quran- is a Divine disclosure of knowledge by Allah to man, and you refuse to acknowledge it when all the preceding Books, foretold things to come crowned by the Quran as has been acknowledged by one or more of Bani-Israel (Children of Israel) who attested that it conforms, like the Book of Mussa (Moses), with truth and agrees with reality?\" Yet you deny it and you turn your heads in contempt and you object to it with inordinate self-esteem. But never will Allah impress piety on the hearts of the perverse who are wrongful of actions"
  46,11,"And those who deny Allah speak of those who sincerely believed in Him, and say: \"If it -the Quran- were good and has a quality in a sufficient degree, we would have been the first to take it as a matter of choice;\" and so, since they respond to the Quran with careless disinterested spirit and disfavour, they will label it: \"fables of old"
  46,12,"And before the Quran, Allah sent down the Book of Mussa steering people by His guidance and His mercy to the path of safety and righteousness, There came down the book-the Quran-, in the Arabic tongue, asserting the truth of the Book of Mussa and warning the perverse who are wrongful of actions, thus serving as blissful tidings to those whose deeds are printed with wisdom and piety"
  46,13,"those who have spiritual perception of Allah and their tongues always vent this feeling, viz: \" Allah is He to Whom we commend ourselves in the act of worship and in reverential awe, in judgment and in our way of life and in all that we do or say, \" and under no circumstances will they alter the attitude of their minds and their habitual mode of settled behaviour; these shall have no ground for alarm nor will fear or dread fall upon them nor will they have a cause of grief Hereafter"
  46,14,These are the inmates of Paradise wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity in requital of their meritorious actions and their wise and pious deeds
