quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,80,"You may invoke Allah's forgiveness on their behalf O Muhammad or you may not; it is one and the same. Even if you invoke Allah's forgiveness on their behalf seventy times, never shall He forgive them. They denied Allah and His Messenger and insolently and defiantly disregarded Allah's commands; Allah does not guide the wicked to His path of righteousness"
  9,81,"These hypocrites, the stay-at-home, rejoiced for remaining behind, leaving the Messenger and his available troops to set forth for the battle and they hated to participate in the expedition; they disliked greatly to strive with their wealth and their lives and incited others not to join the expedition in the scorching heat of the summer.

  9,84,"Nor should you pray -O Muhammad- for any of them who dies nor observe his funeral or burial rites. These are people who denied Allah and His Messenger and died with minds captivated by wickedness, moral and total depravity"

Allah intends to make these attributes the cause of their suffering here below through unrest and anxiety, and their souls be disembodied captivated by disbelief"
  9,86,"And when a Surah is revealed from Heaven enjoining the belief in Allah and commanding action together with His Messenger in His cause you see the able and the affluent among them requesting exemption, saying to you: \"Permit us to remain with those remaining behind. The stay-at-home"
