quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What ails you - people - that you deviate from sense! How could your minds assent to such proposition and induce you to judge and defend this belief
  37,155,Can you not deviate into sense and turn your thoughts upon the truth
  37,156,Or do you have a divine authorization to sanction this belief that you speak like a book
  37,157,(If so) then produce your Sacred Writ that has been issued by Providence if indeed you are declaring the truth
  37,158,And they -the infidels- go further and fare worse; they ascribe to Him affinity to the Jinn when the Jinn themselves do know that they shall be thronged before Him for Judgement
  37,159,Glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. He is infinitely far above what they ascribe to Him
  37,160,Excluded are those (of the Jinn and mankind) who are sincere in mind and spirit and free of that intended mischief that is wrought by want of thought
  37,161,And you -infidels- together with those you revere and adore besides Allah
  37,162,Shall not be able to influence any to deviate from sense
  37,163,Except him who has already been justly predestined to suffer the blazes and Hell asserts him as her own
  37,164,And none of us say the angels but has a place in a certain rank
  37,165,"And the angels add \"we draw up ourselves in ranks arranged in even rows to engage in the act of worship and in divine service"
  37,166,"And it is We who constantly celebrate the praises of Allah and adore His Eternal Name, express our feelings of warm adoration and extol His glorious attributes"
  37,167,"Notwithstanding that before the Prophet's mission there were those* who habited in falsehood and expressed their thoughts in words, thus"
  37,168,"Had we received a Book\", they said, \"like the Scriptures of those of old"
  37,169,We would have been of Allah's votaries who are sincere in mind and spirit
  37,170,"And when the Quran was revealed to them they denied its divine nature and rejected it, but they shall come to know that"
  37,171,"However, Our word was already proclaimed beforehand to Our Messengers whom We sent as spectacles and warnings"
  37,172,That they shall certainly be afforded help
  37,173,And that Our forces shall in the end and at the right time be the winners and victory shall sit on their helm
  37,174,Therefore keep away from them O Muhammad for a while
  37,175,"But keep a vigilant eye upon them for they will be firm and vigilant, anxious to see what falls to your lot and what can happen to them in this life"
  37,176,Do they wish Our punishment be hastened on as a challenge to the truth of the measure and its wisdom
  37,177,"But when it hits their court-yard, what an evil morning shall it be for those who were warned and counselled deaf"
  37,178,Stay away from them O Muhammad or a while
  37,179,"And keep a vigilant eye upon them for they will be firm and vigilant, anxious to see what falls to your lot and what can happen to them in this life"
  37,180,"Glory be to Allah, your Creators the Fountain -Head of glory and honour whose divine and eternal nature exclude Him and absolutely exempt Him from the attributes they ascribe to Him"
  37,181,And peace be extended from Allah and His angels to all Messengers whom He entrusted with His divine message to relate to their people
  37,182,"And by consequence impel -you people- yourselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness and express your praying in words, thus: \"Our bosoms surge up and answer thanks to Allah, Creator of the worlds, past, present and those to come"
