quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  43,11,"Who sends down from the floor of the vault of heaven enough rain water in due measure and thereby a dead and barren land,* is revived; similarly shall you be resurrected"
  43,12,Who created all pairs of opposite sexes and all creatures and made for you of the ships and the beasts a means of transportation
  43,13,"That you may sit and rest comfortably upon their backs and render solemn acknowledgement of Divine favours when making a land travel or a voyage by sea and exercise the mind in devotional thought and put your thoughts into words, thus: \" Glory to Him Who has subjected these animate and inanimate creatures to us; it would have been otherwise impossible to render them submissive and to make them minister to our comfort"
  43,14,"And indeed to Allah, our Creator, we shall all ultimately go back"
  43,15,"Yet they -the infidels- have incorporated with Him some of His servants as objects of worship and considered them His integral part; indeed man is ungrateful, blasphemous and profane"
  43,16,Or did He adopt from among His creatures the females and committed to you people the males
  43,17,"Yet ironically, the moment that any of them hears the news of the birth of his female child, the sex which he ascribes to Allah AL-Rahman, his countenance at once speaks a different language; his eyes shrivel into darkness in his head and he falls into the darkness of deepest dismay"
  43,18,Is it befitting to ascribe to Allah a creature who is born and raised surrounded by ornaments and articles of personal decoration and fails to defend an argument
  43,19,"And they chose female designations to be the appellations they use of and toward the angels who are servants of Allah, AL-Rahman! Did they witness their Creation! We will commit to writing their irresponsible statement and call them to account"
  43,20,"And they allegedly say: \"Had Allah, AL-Rahman, so willed we would never have worshipped -these corporate deities-. They are not acquainted with the truth nor do they have information or proof to support their allegation; they simply lic and indeed they lie in their teeth"
  43,21,Or did We reveal to them a Book beforehand authorizing their allegation that they refer to it anal speak like a book
  43,22,"In effect they projected their own cause so as to say: \"We have found our fathers bent on a particular system of faith and worship and we walk in their foot steps"
