quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,"My people\", he said: \"I do not charge you a price for what I relate to you of Allah's divine message nor for the divine knowledge imparted to me. The reward for divine service rests only in the hands of Allah\". \"Nor can I dismiss those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand or send them away on account of your despicable opinion of them or of viewing them with contempt. They shall meet with Allah, their Creator. in Day of Judgment when I shall have much to answer for\". \"But then I can see that you people are indeed in want of intellect and spiritual knowledge"
  11,30,"Can you people tell me\", he added, \"who shall be able to defend me from Allah and avert His punishment if I dare to dismiss them !\" \"Can you not reflect"
  11,31,"I do not claim to be in possession of the treasuries of Allah, nor do I indulge in prophecy or claim to foretell future events or realize the unseen nor do I say to you I am an angel, or say to you that those whom you view with contempt shall be denied Allah's blessings. Allah knows best their innermost thoughts and feelings\". \"If I commit myself to such a line of conduct, then I am indeed wrongful of actions"
  11,32,"But they said to him: \"O Nuh; you have argued to persuade us of your way you are resolved on and to steer our course of action. In fact, much have you argued. Bring down the promised retributive punishment if you are indeed declaring the truth"
  11,33,"He said to them: \"But it is Allah Who causes His punishment to alight upon you if He will, frand never shall you be able to overpower Him nor escape His punishment"
  11,34,"Nor shall my admonition profit you little or much even if I do my best if Allah should decide to lead you in the wrong in the- train of your ill-natured hearts which reflect the morbidity inherent in your innermost being. He is your Creator, and back to Him shall all of you inevitably return"
  11,35,"Or do they* say about you Muhammad \"He has invented a false story and forged a long tale!\" Say to them: \"If I have wittingly forged what I am relating to you to make it seem divine, then I am responsible for my falsehood which will have become a crime, and I am innocent of all your wrong actions which render you criminal in Allah's sight"
  11,36,"Nuh was inspired by divine influence that: \"No more of your people besides those who have already acknowledged the truth of your mission shall conform to Allah's will, therefore, do not be grieved at heart for what their minds and souls have impelled them to do"
  11,37,Build the Ark under Our supervision and according to Our inspired divine instructions. and do not plead with Me for those who are wrongful of actions they are destined to drown
