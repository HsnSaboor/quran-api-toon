quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"When they -the hypocrites- are told to come back to the Messenger to invoke, on their behalf Allah's mercy and forgiveness, they turn their heads in contempt and you see them objecting with inordinate self- esteem"
  63,6,"The conclusion of all this is one and the same viz: whether you invoke on their behalf Allah's forgiveness or you do not, Allah shall not forgive them. He does not impress piety on the hearts of the wicked"
  63,7,"It was they who said to the people: \"Wherefore do you spend money on those accompanied by Allah's Messenger -who emigrated with him to Madina- and spend yourselves in their cause?\" \"Put a stop,\" they said, \"and refrain from spending on them until they have forsaken him and quitted Madina\". But to Allah, be it known, belongs the rightful possession of treasuries of the heavens and the earth; but the hypocrites do nod comprehend this as a fact"
  63,8,"They say: \"If we should return to Madina, the one with nobility in his nature and nobility is native to him, shall displace and oust the base who is nobody"
  63,9,"O you whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: Let not your wealth nor your progeny distract your minds and attention from remembering Allah and keeping Him in mind. He who is allured by his wealth or his progeny to neglect his duty and obligations to Allah shall he and such persons incur the privation of hope and suffer loss"
  63,10,"And spend in benefaction and in benevolence of what We have given you, before the encounter with death occasions anyone of you and then he says \"My Creator, if only you would delay my death for a while, I will seize my opportunity to be liberal in my benefactions and engage in deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety"
  63,11,But Allah shall not delay the death of a soul when its time is fulfilled; and Allah is well acquainted with what the bosoms store of thoughts and feelings and with all that you do
