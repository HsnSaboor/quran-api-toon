quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,Another outward and visible sign reflecting for them an inward and spiritual grace is that We carried their descendants in the loaded ark
  36,42,And We created for them the like thereof for their transport
  36,43,And if We willed We could drown them and no one would be there to hear their yelling nor would there be an expected rescue
  36,44,Unless We extend to them Our mercy and let them enjoy life up to a predetermined point of time
  36,45,"And when they are told: \"Fear for your irreverence to Allah and regard with fear the retributive punishment which you might encounter here. Fear also what awaits you Hereafter which is indeed grievous and really severe so that you might hopefully be recipients of Allah’s mercy"
  36,46,And no divine sign of Allah's marvels be presented to them but they meet with aversion and oppose it with repugnance
  36,47,"And when told to spend in benevolence of what Allah has bestowed them and given them of His bounty, the infidels express their thoughts in words and pitifully say: \"Shall we feed him whom Allah can feed if He will! You must be deviated in mind and have wandered from the path of righteousness"
  36,48,"And incidentally\" they add: \" When does that alleged promise – Hereafter – fall due, if indeed you are declaring the truth"
  36,49,Do they mean to wait until a merciless blast seizes them while they are more ready to argue than to obey
  36,50,And then it is too late to act nor do they have the chance to settle or dispose of their affairs verbally or in writing nor to their people will they return
  36,51,"Then the trumpet is sounded and there they egress from the graves and toward Allah, their Creator, they move with impetuousity"
  36,52,"Wherefore they exclaim: \"woe betide us! Who has awakened us from our resting site?\" This is, they are told, \"what Allah had promised and the verity which the truthful Messengers had related"
  36,53,"Then, there is only one single loud call which raises alarm and incites to action and there they are assembled before Us for Judgement"
  36,54,This Day shall no soul suffer injustice or be wronged in the least and you – people– shall only be requited with what is commensurate with your deeds
