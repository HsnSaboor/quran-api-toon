quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,51,"O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: Do not take the Jews and the Christians -when warring against you- as intimate friends nor favour their tutelage; they both act in concert to set themselves as your antagonists, and their ill-will unites their thoughts. And he who favours their tutelage shall be counted as one of them; Allah does not guide the wrongful to His path of righteousness"
  5,52,"And you see those hypocrites whose ill-natured hearts reflect the morbidity inherent in their innermost being, hasten on to win their tutelage and they interpret their thoughts in words, Thus: \"We fear,\" they say, \"lest one day fortune be on their side and we should be overcome and suffer at their hands\". May Allah make victory sit on your helm O Muslims or take matters of fact and circumstance them after His own manner; there and then shall the hypocrites be really sorry and pained at heart for having succumbed to their evil thoughts"
  5,53,"And there and then shall say those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand to Ahl AL-Kitab: \"Are these -the hypocrites- not the people who swore fealty to you\". Now have their hopes been doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness; they have come to be great losers"
  5,54,"O you who have conformed to Islam : He who turns renegade and deserts Islam in favour of another religion shall not frustrate the laws nor the statutes of heaven's realm; Allah shall replace them by people whom He favours and who lift to Him their inward sight; they are humble and meek with their co - religionists and proud - hearted hauty severe toward the infidels; they strive in the cause of Allah not caring what people say. This is the grace of Allah; He confers it on whom He will, and Allah is Wasiun (Omnipresent),and 'Alimun"
  5,55,"Indeed the only tutelary guardian you have O Muslims is Allah and the only tutelary friends you have are His Messenger and those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand, who engage in the act of worship, give Zakat and kneel to Allah in adoration"
  5,56,"And he who chooses to be under Allah’s, tutelage and takes His Messenger and those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand as his tutelary friends shall find that Allah’s party attains the desired end"
  5,57,"O You who have conformed to Islam: Do not take defenders, supporters, or intimate friends from among those given the Book before you, nor from the infidels who are at enmity with your faith. It is incumbent on you to deny their tutelage. They mock your religion and amuse themselves with its principles. You just entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah if indeed your hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues"
