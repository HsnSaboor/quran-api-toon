  7,23,"Indeed O Allah, our Creator\", they said: \"We were wrongful of actions, and unless You, in Whom we have the forgiveness of sins, extend Your mercy to both of us and forgive us, we will most certainly be great losers"
  7,24,"Allah said: \"Upon Our command We down all of you upon, to a lower state with mutual enmity to each other and you shall settle on earth where you make abode and livelihood for a predetermined point of time"
