quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,I swear by the celestial body when it goes down to make an apparent descent toward and below the horizon
  53,2,In confirmation of the truthful attributes of your compatriot Muhammad- who did not err nor stray from the path of safety and righteousness
  53,3,"Nor does he give utterance to words, moved by selfish motives, or utters error against Allah and commits his heart to inequity"
  53,4,"But what he relates to you people is nothing other than a Quran revealed to him by inspiration from Allah, and it extends to all subjects treated"
  53,5,"A Divine disclosure of knowledge to mankind, instructed to him by the mighty messenger of Allah the Spirit Jibril (Gabriel)"
  53,6,"Who is endowed with power, wisdom and capacities of action, and in a majestic imposingly dignified appearance did he come forth into view"
  53,7,"At first, when he assumed the astronomical horizon"
  53,8,Then when he moved down toward the visible horizon and came closer and closer
  53,9,Until the intervening distance between him and Muhammad was no more than two bows length or even closer
  53,10,And through him -the spirit Jibril- did Allah inspire His servant Muhammad- with whatever was meant to be intimated
  53,11,He -Muhammad- never devised a falsity nor could he change what his heart's ears have heard nor what his mind's eyes have seen
  53,12,"Wherefore, then do you people argue against what he saw"
  53,13,"In effect, he- Muhammad- saw him- the Spirit Gabriel- on another occasion"
  53,14,"At the site where he -the Spirit Jibril- took Up his station in the realm of heaven, a site designated \" Sidrat Al Montaha \"; (interpreted to be the boundary fenced by trees, where no one, spiritual or otherwise can ascend or descend beyond, unless ordained by Allah)"
  53,15,The site which is in close proximity to the heavenly paradise of supreme bliss where the righteous make abode
  53,16,"The site which no one can conceive what embellishment overlays it, a Sidra ornamented by what no eye has seen nor ear heard"
  53,17,"He -Muhammad- never turned aside, nor did he lose sight of anything he was meant to see at that site, nor did his mind's eyes wander here or there"
  53,18,What he saw was indeed beyond human comprehension; he saw some of his Creator's wonders and signs serving to demonstrate Divine power and omnipotence
  53,19,Do you -Meccans- see the idols Al Lat and Al 'Uzza you honour and revere and regard with extreme respect and devotion
  53,20,And the other idol - Manat - third of the group
  53,21,Have you chosen the idol you designated as male and left to Allah what you designated as female
  53,22,But this is quite an unfair distribution
  53,23,These are nothing but names you and your forefathers have designated and destined to the purpose of worship; names never authorized by Allah nor sanctioned. by Him They only follow the false suppositions and the incitement arising from the state of their minds and feeling albeit they have received from Allah the spirit of truth guiding them into all truth
  53,24,Or does man think that whatever he wishes or desires is law
  53,25,"But to Allah belong the future and the present, the end and the beginning, all things to be and all that has been, and Hereafter and here"
  53,26,"A good many angels in the heaven's realm cannot intercede on behalf of any being nor does their intercession avail any, unless Allah permits, and then, only on behalf of whom He accepts"
