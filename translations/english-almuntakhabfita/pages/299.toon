quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  18,46,"Wealth and progeny feature the attraction and allurement exciting the pleasurable emotion of people in life here below, but what is infinite in future duration considered by Allah to have eternal consequences and hopeful reward are the deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety"
  18,47,"The Day shall come when We put or set the mountains in motion and you see the earth bare of the natural objects it once had, and We will have thronged them -all people- to judgement, leaving not one behind"
  18,48,"They shall be ranked before Allah in rows and be told: \"Now you have come back to Us as bare, open to view and unprotected as We created you in the beginning, yet you presumed earlier upon Providence and took for granted that We would not predetermine for you a point of time"
  18,49,"Now the Book of personal records is laid open to view and you shall see the sinful alarmed at its contents and excited with sudden fear and apprehension of danger. They express their thoughts in words, thus: \"Woe betide us. This book\", they say, \"does not leave out a minor or a major offense unrecorded\", and they shall find that every single deed, good or back is being presented and then they shall realize that Allah, your Creator, wrongs no one"
  18,50,"For once We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves to Adam in adoration, and the angels prostrated to Adam in comely order praise and admiration except Iblis, AL-Shaytan-to-be, who was a Jinn juxtaposed* to the angels and by consequence he disobeyed Allah, his Creator. So conditioned, do you people take him and his progeny as tutelary guardians besides Allah when they are your avowed enemy! Evil indeed is the substitute adopted by the wrongful of actions"
  18,51,"Never did I invite them -neither these nor those nor any creature- to be present, to spectate or to be associated with the event of the creation of the heavens and the earth nor of themselves -in reference to Adam- nor did I need help nor is it befitting. It is not Allah Who would use the help of others not to mention the wicked who mislead people"
  18,52,"The Day shall come when Allah says to the infidels: \"Call forth My partners whom you presumed to share My divine nature and Omnipotence\", and they shall do so, but their gods shall give back no answer, and We established between them - they and their gods- in life below the relationship leading to their final damnation"
  18,53,And the wicked shall see Hell open to view and realize that they shall have to cast themselves head-long therein and that there is no escape
