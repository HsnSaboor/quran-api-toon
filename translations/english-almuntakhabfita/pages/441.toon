quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  36,13,"And cite to them the inhabitants of the town to whom We sent Our Messengers, an example by way of a parable, by which moral and spiritual relations are typically set forth"
  36,14,"We sent to them two of Our envoys whom they declined to accept and accused them of falsehood. We sustained them by a third who together with the other two assured them thus: \"We have been commissioned by Allah\". they said, \"and entrusted with His divine message which we relate to you"
  36,15,"But the inhabitants said: \"But you are simply mortals like us and never did Allah, AL-Rahman, disclose divine knowledge or anything else to a mortal: \"You are indeed liars"
  36,16,"And there, the messengers said: \" Indeed, does Allah, our Creator, know that we have been entrusted with His divine message to relate it to you"
  36,17,"And we are responsible only for proclaiming His divine message distinctly expressing all that is meant, leaving nothing merely implied"
  36,18,"But again the people said to the Messengers: \"We augur from you and we esteem you as omens presaging some direful calamity, therefore unless you stop holding discourse of this faked message, we will pelt you with stones and you shall suffer grievously at our hands"
  36,19,"The Messengers said: \"You augur well or ill according to your disposition and your intentions, and the mould of your fortune is in yourselves and the event is only sanctioned by Allah\". And do you people, they added, \"consider the spirit of truth that guides into all truth a presage of evil! You are but a people characterized by disobedience and transgression"
  36,20,"And there came a man from the far end of the city, moved with compassion for his fellow men who rejected what he knew to be the truth, to say to them: \"O my people, obey them, they are Messengers entrusted with the spirit of truth- that guides into all truth"
  36,21,"Obey them\", he added, \"they do not ask you for a price or anything in return, they themselves are guided into all truth and wish to relate it to you"
  36,22,"And why should I not regard Allah with extreme devotion\", he said, \"and adore Him with appropriate acts and rites when it is He Who brought me into being and caused me to exist and He is the end and the purpose for which We are destined and to Him shall all of us return"
  36,23,"Therefore, would I take besides Him gods whose intercession, if ever permitted, is valueless nor can they protect me or save me from harm should He, AL-Rahman, mean to befall me with a misfortune or wed me to a calamity"
  36,24,For then the work of the devil will have been manifest in me and I would have been led by the nose to the loss in the maze of error
  36,25,"Hear me\", he said, \"as I declare that I have acknowledged Allah, your Creator, and accepted His system of faith and worship with a consenting mind and you shall bear witness to this declaration here and Hereafter"
  36,26,"(The man might have suffered martyrdom at their hands) Received with gracious and hearty welcome and great honour in heaven’s Realm, he was ushered to Paradise and there he exclaimed: \"I wish my people knew"
  36,27,"How has Allah, my Creator, received me, forgiven me and united me with those who are highly esteemed and greatly honoured"
