quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  40,67,"He is it Who raised you, by special creation from dust, then He made you evolve from a constituent part of emitted fluid, then from a clinging organism, then He disburdens the wombs of you as a new born babe. You grow to maturity, then you are carried through the stealing steps of age to advanced life. And among you is he who encounters death earlier, and you are destined to live on to a predetermined age that you may hopefully reflect"
