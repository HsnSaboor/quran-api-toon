quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  38,27,"We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them in vain as the infidels have thought, they brew falsehood and think falsehood; Woe to them, they shall be the fuel for the fire"
  38,28,Or shall We requite those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety on the same ground as We requite those who play the mischief on earth! or do We requite those in whose hearts reigns piety as We requite those who grow daily more and more wicked
  38,29,"This Quran is a Book We have revealed to you O Muhammad invested with blessings and declaring Allah's benediction and divine favours so that people might ponder its precepts, its signs and revelations and that people of understanding hearts and minds may reflect"
  38,30,"We pestowed Dawud with the privilege of begetting Sulayman, an excellent worshipper who in lowliest plight repentant stood"
  38,31,Mustered before him -Sulayman- at eventide for display were coursers of the finest breed which spring and bound in high mettle (they stand on three feet implanted and the fourth lightly touching the ground)
  38,32,"In admiration Sulayman said: \"My fondness for the chargers has been an attribute inherent in me due to the vital part they play in Allah's cause and they keep my remembrance applied to Him\". He kept admiring them until they disappeared from view behind the curtain and the sun took cover in the veil of night"
  38,33,"There did Sulayman give orders, thus: \"Bring them back to me, \"he said\". and he kept patting them on the necks passing his hand over the forenegs expressing fondness and endearment"
  38,34,"We decided to try Sulayman like We tried the other Messengers and test his true inclination worldly and spiritually, We seated a phantom on his throne. No sooner did it come to his mind that he was tried than he in lowliest plight repentant stood"
  38,35,"He prayed, thus: \"I pray and beseech you O Allah, my Creator, to forgive me and to bestow on me a kingdom none else after me will be fit to have; You are in command of the gratuitous blessings of heaven"
  38,36,"And there We subdued the wind and We made its activity subservient to his command, it flowed gently to wherever He willed and yielded to his demand"
  38,37,And those among the Jinn characterized with satanic attributes did We also subdue to him comprising every builder and every diver
  38,38,And others of those satanic bound together with fetters to impose upon them restraint
  38,39,"This, We said, is Our bestowal O Sulayman, you have a free hand, you may give what you will to whom you will and deny whom you will what you will"
  38,40,And he enjoyed endearment and high station of dignity and distinction in the company of those in Our realm of heaven and excellent shall be his final place of destination
  38,41,"And apply remembrance O Muhammad to Our worshipper Ayub. He invoked Allah, his Creator, for mercy, He prayed \" O Allah, my Creator, the Devil has caused me much inconvience and pain by suggesting evil thoughts to the minds of the few who adhere to me including my wife"
  38,42,"And there We turned to him in mercy for his sincerity and endurance and We said to him: Stamp the ground with the sole of your foot and there you will have a flowing stream of cold water to wash therewith and to drink therefrom"
