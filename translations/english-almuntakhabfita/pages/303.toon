quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  18,84,"Allah says: \"We confirmed him on earth and We imparted to him the knowledge of the ways and means serving a purposeful end"
  18,85,And he purposefully lead the way
  18,86,"He took the lead in an expedition toward he west until he reached a body of water -said to be the Atlantic Ocean, or more likely a mirky land abounding in swamps– where -he thought when viewing the horizon- the sun sets and where he found a -disorderly and unruly- people over whom We gave him authority. We left to him the manner of dealing with them. Either you punish them, We said or show them kindness"
  18,87,"He set up his constitution -in the occupied territories- and accordingly he stated: \"We will punish the wrongful of actions here and he wilt be left to Allah, his Creator, to impose upon him the torment laid upon the damned Hereafter"
  18,88,"Whereas he whose heart reflects the image of religious and , spiritual virtues and his deeds wisdom and piety will be rewarded with what is best and we will treat him kindly and impose on him what he can bear with ease and what sets his mind at rest"
  18,89,"Again, he purposefully lead the way"
  18,90,He conducted an expedition eastward where the sun rises until he reached an open territory -probably a desert- where -he thought when viewing the horizon- the sun rises and where the people -who were primitive- had no covering besides the sun
  18,91,For thus We knew his thoughts and feelings as well as his mode of action
  18,92,Again he purposefully lead the way
  18,93,Until he reached a stretch of territory towered by two barriers -probably mountains- beneath which he found a people who could hardly understand a foreign word or language
  18,94,"They said to him -through interpreters-: \"O you Zul- Qarnain, the tribes of Gog and Magog* are people who have both mischief and ill-will in their composition and they spread discord in the land. May we apportion to you a tribute in payment of raising a rampart between us, a rampart that would be invincible against all assaults"
  18,95,"He said: \"what Allah has bestowed on me of wealth and power far excels your tribute. You just help me with your laborious attempt and strenuous exertion of power and I will erect a barrier between you"
  18,96,"Bring me blocks or sheets of iron\", he said, \"to fill up the space between the two natural barriers\", then he said to them \"Now you may subject it to fire and use your bellows to make it red hot, and when it softened he asked them for molten brass to pour on the iron to weld in solid mass"
  18,97,"In consequence, they -the tribes- could not escalade it nor were they able to make their way through it by digging"
