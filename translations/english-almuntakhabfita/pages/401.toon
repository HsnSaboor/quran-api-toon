quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  29,39,"Similarly reacted Qarun, Pharaoh and his grand vizier Haman when Mussa was sent to them and presented them with clear and plain revelations and signs guiding out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment. But they displayed inordinate self-esteem and extravagance in their accounts of themselves. nevertheless, they did not escape Our notice and consequently Our retributive punishment"
  29,40,Each one of them did We penalize with what was commensurate with his evil deed. Among them were those against whom We sent a whirlwind and sand dunes and those who were overtaken by a merciless blast and those whom We eclipsed in one swallow by the yawning chasm We created beneath them and among them were those whom We drowned. And never was it Allah's attribute to do them injustice but it was they who wronged themselves
  29,41,"The like of those who take tutelary guardians or protectors besides Allah stands similitude exact of the spider which seeks protection in a house made of slender filaments or threads spun all round. It may be strong enough to suit its purpose, but it collapses by a wave of the hand, and so the spider's house is indeed the flimsiest of all houses if only they -the infidels- know"
  29,42,"Indeed, Allah knows all things and He is Omniscient of everything animate or inanimate -the infidels- invoke besides Him. He is AL-Aziz and AL-Hakim (characterized by good sense and Prudence) (the Wise)"

  29,44,Allah created the heavens and the earth in conformity with fact and in agreement with reality and this is a meaningful sign impressive indeed to those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand
  29,45,"Do recite O Muhammad all that has been revealed to you of the Book -the Quran- and establish worship and adore Allah, your Creator, with appropriate acts and rites, for sincere prayer checks abomination and immorality. To apply remembrance to Allah is more eminent in point of attainments and achievement, and Allah knows all that you do"
