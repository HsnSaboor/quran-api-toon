quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,He pondered and he planned
  74,19,"Woe be he, for how he pondered and how he planned"
  74,20,and woe indeed will he be for the way he pondered and planned
  74,21,Then he directed his intellectual eye and analyzed and scanned
  74,22,Then he ended with knitting his brows in displeasure and his look expressed disapproval
  74,23,Then he concluded to turn a deaf ear and to continue in his inordinate self- esteem
  74,24,"Then he said \"This is nothing but sorcery assumed by Muhammad from the fables of those of old"
  74,25,"Then he added, \"it is nothing but words expressed by mortals; words which to our beliefs do not accord"
  74,26,"There I will cast him into the pit of Hell named \"Saqar"
  74,27,"and you just do not know what \"Saqar\" is like"
  74,28,"Its fiercely fiery infernal flames simply consume anything coming their way, but the wicked shall neither die nor live therein"
  74,29,"Unkind to mankind; it blackens, then burns their skin, but as often as their integument is consumed it is replaced by a fresh new skin"
  74,30,"It \" Saqar \" is guarded by a body of angels numerically nineteen, massive, robust mighty and severe on strangers"
  74,31,"(We assigned to no one but the angels the guardianship of the Fire and We stated their number a) to try those infidels' unsatisfied desire, b) to assure Ahl AL-Kitab, of the Divine Nature of Muhammad's mission, c) to give the faithful reason to consume their wisdom in confidence, d) to give neither party Ahl AL-Kitab and the faithful- an occasion to doubt, e) and to induce the hypocrites, the ill-disposed whose seats of intellect melt away in disease and lassitude as well as the infidels to speak out; and indeed they did. They said: What has Allah meant when He mentioned the Angels' number and what does He mean to fulfill?.Thus does Allah mislead whom He pleases and guides whom He will. and no one knows the number of your Creator's forces but He, and the description portraying « Saqar » is only a reminder to mankind"
  74,32,"No, but I swear by the moon"
  74,33,and by the night as it retreats and falls into a swoon
  74,34,By the apparent ascent of the sun above the horizon at the beginning of the day
  74,35,"That \"Saqar\" is one of many pits of Hell that is. ghastly and immense"
  74,36,Portrayed to warn mankind
  74,37,"So that he who wishes to proceed to the right path may still have a chance, and he who wishes to lag behind, err and stray will have been warned"
  74,38,Every soul shall be pledged for its deeds
  74,39,Except those destined to hold he position on the right
  74,40,"Beheld in bliss, they will convey their thoughts reciprocally in talk"
  74,41,With the wicked in their infernal abyss
  74,42,"They will ask them: “ What brought you to \"Saqar\" ? ”"
  74,43,"We were not among those who engaged in worship. \" they will admit"
  74,44,Nor did we feed the indigent nor to benevolence did we submit
  74,45,We always joined those who delighted in idle talk and we were given to indulging in personal vanity and drowned ourselves in the nonsensical
  74,46,We obstinately refused to acknowledge the truth of Day of Judgment and actuality
  74,47,Until we were caught in the jaws of death and were affronted with reality
