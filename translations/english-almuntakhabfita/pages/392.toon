quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  28,51,We have already imparted to them the divine knowledge to guide then into all truth that they may hopefully lift to Allah their inward sight and keep Him in mind
  28,52,And those to whom We gave the Book before this Book -the Jews and the Christians- do acknowledge the Quran and the truth of your divine mission
  28,53,"When it is recited to them they express their thoughts in words. They say: \"We do acknowledge Allah's divine discourse represented in the Quran for it reflects the divine truth notwithstanding that long before the Quran We conformed to Islam"
  28,54,"Such persons shall be requited in double, for their suffering and for enduring pain and hostilities, for their constancy in labour, exertion and effort and for their forbearance under provocation. They repel pride with prudence and evil with good and they spend in benevolence and benefaction of the provisions of life We provisioned them"
  28,55,"These are they who do not pervert their senses. When they hear idle talk gossip or slander they refrain from listening and turn away and say to the profaners: \"We are responsible for our deeds and you are response for yours; peace be upon you. We are not interested in the ignorant who have no shame of their sins"
  28,56,You Muhammad shall not be able to guide to Allah's path whom you like or to whom you have special affection* but Allah guides to His path of righteousness whom He will and He knows best those who are willing to lift to Him their inward sight
  28,57,"And they -the infidels- say to you: \" Should we fall in line with you and follow your exhortation we will be ousted from our land and be robbed of our rights and privileges!\" Did We not confirm to them on a secure basis a safe and sacred Sanctuary secured by religious sentiments and reverence against violation, infringement or encroachment. We caused the flow of all kinds of fruits and the products of everything to its environ; a livelihood provided by Us albeit most of them are ignorant of this fact"
  28,58,How many towns did We reduce to a useless form after Our grace was made to abound in them and they met it with dissatisfaction and ingratitude! There you can see how their dwellings were left desolate thereafter and destitute of inhabitants but of a few and We were the inheritors
  28,59,"And never did Allah, your Creator, reduce the towns to a useless form until He had sent a Messenger to their capital to recite to the people Our divine revelations but they closed their hearts' ears. Therefore, never did We reduce the towns to a useless form except when the fundamental truth failed to govern their thoughts and they proved themselves wrongful of actions"
