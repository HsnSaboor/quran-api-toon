  76,28,"We created them and gave them enough will power to withstand temptation. When We will, We can replace them by others and effect a new creation"
  76,29,This is an admonition for him who chooses to follow the path prescribed by Allah his Creator. and ponder the Quranic Revelation
  76,30,Nor can you exercise your will without Allah's accord; He has always been Alimun (Omniscient) and Hakimun (Wise)
  76,31,"He accepts whom He will and bestows His grace and mercy on whom He will and for the wrong-doers has He prepared a tormenting punishment, taking them from the highest stage of honour to the lowest stair of disgrace"
  77,1,By the winds blowing in any of the four directions and of gradual degrees of force perceptible to the senses
  77,2,"Then they become high, causing violent disturbance of the atmosphere and may engender a storm"

  77,4,"and by the angels carrying Allah's Messages to His Messengers heralding the standard by which anything is judged right or wrong, virtuous or immoral, permissible or forbidden"
  77,5,Then they disclose to them -to the Messengers- Allah's revelations and ordinances which inspirit the faith

  77,14,You just do not know what this Day of decision and adjudication is like
  77,15,"Woe then, to those who looked upon the truth as manifest falsification"
  77,16,Did We not destroy those who charged Our Messengers with falsehood among the predecessors
  77,17,and in like manner did We destroy the successors
  77,18,Thus do We requite people given to sin
  77,19,"Woe then, to those who looked upon the truth as an intentional assertion of falsehood"
