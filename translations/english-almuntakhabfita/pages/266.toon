quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  15,71,"There\", said Lut, \"you may wed my daughters if you must exercise your libidinous desire"
  15,72,"To your life, O prophets\" he was told, \"they -the wicked- are wandering here and there being deceived by their vain illusive sensuous perception which shall melt when the sun beams glow"
  15,73,"And there it was: a single cry* from heaven's realm stirred up a merciless blast which overtook them by sun- rise"
  15,74,And We turned those cities -Sodom and Gomorrah- upside down and rained them with fire and successional brimstones as hard as baked clay
  15,75,These are indeed divine signs making a deep impression on the minds or senses of those who ponder
  15,76,And the evidence still stands as a scene of dismal devastation to the travelers (in the neighbourhood of the dead sea between Syria and Arabia)
  15,77,This is indeed a meaningful sign which is quite impressive to those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand
  15,78,Thus much did the woodlanders Madyanites wrong themselves and were wrongful of actions
  15,79,And in consequence we took just-vengeance on them and both sites stand manifest of the events on a course of travel where people can see
  15,80,Similarly did the dwellers of the rocky territory -the Thamudites- deny the truth of the divine message conveyed to them by the Messengers and were wrongful of actions
  15,81,And We presented them with Our signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority but they took objection against them and a dislike
  15,82,And they were carving the mountains into homes wherein they made abode and enjoyed safety and security
  15,83,Nonetheless a single cry* from heaven's realm stirred up a merciless rumbling earthly convulsion which overtook them by day light
  15,84,"And so be it, what they gained of skill and enjoyed of safety did not profit them nor help them accomplish a useful purpose"
  15,85,"Nor did We create the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them but in accordance with reason and truth and for just ends. And the Final predetermined Hour is inevitably coming, therefore, forgive O Muhammad your opponent's human instability with gracious intent"
  15,86,"For, it is Allah, indeed who is the Creator of the whole and of all in all and He is the AL-'Alim (the Omniscient)"
  15,87,"And We have given you O Muhammad seven reiterative dual verses of opening in Allah's Name: in praise, in thanks, in action and in prayer, and the meritorious Quran which is eminently entitled to the designation, the great"
  15,88,"Do not direct your sight wistfully O Muhammad at the advantages We gave to some of the unbelievers among the various sects nor grieve at heart for their disobedience to Allah, and be soft in temper and disposition to those whose hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and take them under your wing"
  15,89,"And say: \"I hereby declare to the wide circle of the all that I am delegated by Allah to make manifest His warning against denying Him and/or His statutes"
  15,90,"Just as We had sent down a warning to those who treated Our Scriptures in the way it suited them dividing them into parts, accepting some and rejecting others"
