  5,24,"Thus still they said to Mussa: \"O Mussa, we shall never make entry therein so long as they are within; you go along with Allah, your Creator and fight them yourselves; we are staying here"
  5,25,"There and then prayed Mussa: \"O Allah, my Creator\", he said: \"I have no jurisdiction over any but myself and my brother, we leave them to You to judge between us and those wrongful of actions and to ordain what You will"
  5,26,"In response Allah said: \"Forbidden unto them shall this land be for forty years, wandering restlessly not knowing where to go nor in quest shall they know of what, Therefore, do not grieve O Mussa over those who grow daily more and more wicked"
  5,27,"And relate to -the Jews- O Muhammad, the true narrative of the two sons of Adam, -Habil and Kabil- each of them made an offering to Allah hoping to be recipients of His blessings. But Allah accepted the oblation of one and not the other. Vexed at the good fortune of his brother, the latter said to the former: \"I will kill you\". And there said the former: \"But Allah accepts the deeds of those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him"
  5,28,"Should you be tempted\", he continued, \"to lay your violent hands upon me to kill me, never will I lay violent hands upon you to kill you; I fear Allah, Creator of the worlds"
  5,29,"In fact\", he added, \"I wish you would bear the consequences of my iniquities and of your wrongs and be an inmate of Hell, for this is the reward of those, wrongful of actions"
  5,30,"He succumbed to his evil thought of slaying his brother and he killed him, only to incur the loss of the noble qualities of the soul and be one of those born to be losers"
  5,31,"Unable to handle the corpse of his brother, he was at a loss. There and then did Allah send a raven to remove earth with its claws to bury a dead raven so that the killer would know how to dispose of his brother's corpse? The raven having shamed him with its notable performance, he said: \"Woe betide me; have I not been even able to be like this raven to dispose of my brother’s corpse and obstruct the view of my crime! \" And there he was left with nothing but pining regrets and vain repentance"
