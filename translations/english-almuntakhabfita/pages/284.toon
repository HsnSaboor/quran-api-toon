quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  17,18,"He who wishes to go by the world and its fleeting, evanescent and ephemeral enjoyment and glory will find Allah moving quickly to respond to whom He will and apportion to him what He will, but in the end We will make Hell his abode where he sits brooding on its vast abyss, censured, despised and rejected"
  17,19,"But he who chooses the Hereafter and has purposed that it be the heart of his purpose and directs his efforts to fulfilling the requirements incidental to this end with a heart impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues shall, he and such persons find that heir endeavor is esteemed and highly appreciated"
  17,20,"Those and these are given what is apportioned to them. We bestow on both of them of our bounty and never was the bounty of Allah, your Creator, confinable to any limits"
  17,21,"See how We distinguish some in status, rank or fortune above others! And by the same token have We made the Hereafter excel here below and be the world of choice"
  17,22,Do not set up with Allah another god nor incorporate with Him other deities lest you should be censured and left abandoned and forsaken
  17,23,"Allah, your Creator, has ordained, that you worship no one but Him and you adore Him with appropriate acts and rites and that you commit your parents to your kind care. When one or both of them attain old age they expect your friendly disposition by your conduct to them. Therefore do not offend them by giving vent to an exclamation of impatience or disgust nor should you rebuke or reprimand them and let your dissertation with them be a sweet discourse"
  17,24,"And lower to them the wing of power in humility, standing manifest of kindness and mercy and invoke Allah to be merciful to them and express your invocatory prayer in words, thus: O Allah, my Creator, I pray and beseech you to extend to them Your mercy in return for bringing me up and setting me on my feet which confess their toilsome care for me in my childhood"
  17,25,"Allah, my Creator, knows best your thoughts and feelings and all that is stored in your innermost being. If you happen to be virtuous, He is indeed forgiving to those who in lowliest plight repentant stand"
  17,26,"And render to the poor being of kin his due and also to the needy and to the wayfarer who does not have the means for transportation, but do not expend extravagantly or wastefully"
  17,27,"Indeed, the wasteful given to useless or excessive expenditure are the twins of the satanic, and AL-Shaytan has been rebellious, disobedient and ungrateful to Allah, his Creator"
