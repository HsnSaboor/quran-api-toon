quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Do you see O Muhammad the one* who totally rejects Our revelations and denies the Hereafter as well as Our convincing signs, and mockingly says to his debtee**: \"l will be given Hereafter, plenty and live in affluence and have progeny in numerosity then I will pay you the debt"
  19,78,"How insolent to presume upon Providence! Has he been given divine knowledge of the unknown or the ability to realize the unseen or has he entered into a covenant with Allah, AL-Rahman"
  19,79,"Never, but he had better restrain himself from uttering words conveying absurdities. We will relate in writing and record all that he says and prolong the punishment of his soul which welcomes wrongs, to such an extent as he never portrayed in his mind"
  19,80,"We will take possession of all that he said he would have, and he comes back to Us all alone"
  19,81,They -the infidels- chose to take besides Allah false gods through whom they seek predominance and glory here and intercession Hereafter
  19,82,"Never, but they shall disclaim knowledge of their zealous devotion and exercise active opposition against them, and as enemies they -the false gods- shall obtain their end"
  19,83,Do you look O Muhammad into the way We use the satanic! We send them against the infidels to rouse up their vain desires and incite them to do evil
  19,84,"Therefore, do not call O Muhammad upon Allah to hasten the retributive punishment unto them. We keep count of their misdeeds and all their pursuits of the world during their numbered days here, and they shall have much to answer for Hereafter"
  19,85,The Day shall come when the faithful are assembled before AL-Rahman in a presentable and dignified manner
  19,86,And We drive the sinful to Hell like thirsty cattle
  19,87,No one shall have the advantage nor the power of intercession except him who has been promised to this effect by AL-Rahman
  19,88,"They say: \"Allah, AL-Rahman has taken up, adopted or begotten a son"
  19,89,"You blasphemers have instituted a notion that is indeed monstrous, enormous anal atrocious"
  19,90,A notion indeed shocking. Its impact makes the heavens tremble and almost tear apart asunder and the earth quakes and almost parts asunder and the mountains quiver and almost crumble
  19,91,that they ascribe to AL-Rahman a son
  19,92,"when it is absolutely unbecoming nor is it consonant with His Supreme Majesty that He should take up, adopt or beget a son"
  19,93,that is besides the fact that there is not one single creature in the heavens and on earth but shall come back to stand before AL-Rahman as a servant submitting to His Authority and surrendering himself or itself to Judgement
  19,94,He has counted them and ascertained their number
  19,95,All and each shall present himself or itself to AL-Rahman singly
