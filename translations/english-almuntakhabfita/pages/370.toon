quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,61,"And when the two bodies of men came within each other's range of sight, the compatriots of Mussa exclaimed: \" We are evidently overtaken"
  26,62,"Not at all\", Mussa said, \"Allah, my Creator overshadows me with His gracious wing; He is by my side to guide me as He will"
  26,63,"We inspired Mussa to strike the sea with his staff and there did the sea split into two enormous divisions, each partition as immense as a huge mountain"
  26,64,And We induced the others -Pharaoh and his people- to tail Mussa and his people who were then in the footpath
  26,65,And We delivered Mussa and all those with him
  26,66,And We drowned all the others -Pharaoh and all those with him
  26,67,"This is indeed emblematic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority but most of them denied Allah, the Creator.(to Pharaoh' people Allah was the Pharaoh himself)"
  26,68,"And Allah, your creator, is AL-Aziz and AL-Rahim, indeed"
  26,69,And relate to the people O Muhammad the narrative of Ibrahim with his father
  26,70,"He asked his father and his people: \"What do you people worship"
  26,71,"We worship idols\" they said, and adore them with appropriate acts and rites and we are attached to them and unmoved in mind"
  26,72,"Do they hear you\", Ibrahim asked, \"when you praise them or supplicate"
  26,73,Or do they profit you or hurt
  26,74,"But\", they said, \"this is exactly the system of faith and worship our fathers adopted"
  26,75,"Do you see\", Ibrahim said, \"all those you adored and revered as objects of worship"
  26,76,And you and your fathers and your ancestors treated with respect and devotion
  26,77,"They are adversaries who might obtain their end and therefore enemies to me but not Allah, the Creator of the worlds, the visible and the invisible, past, present and those to come"
  26,78,The Creator- Who brought me into existence and it is He Who guides me to the truth and to the path of righteousness
  26,79,It is He Who provides me with victuals to eat and drinkables (to drink)
  26,80,"And when I fall sick, it is He Who restores me to health"
  26,81,And it is He Who determines the moment and the cause of my death and occasions my resurrection and restoration to life
  26,82,The Creator- Whom I hope will relent and quit me all His debt and will forgive me my wrongful actions when I have audience of Him in Day of Judgement
  26,83,"And to Him I express my thoughts in my invocatory prayer, thus: \"Confer on me O Allah, my Creator, wisdom to help me judge rightly in matters relating to physical and spiritual life and to impart to me soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends, and unite me, O Allah, with the society of those in whose hearts reigns piety"
