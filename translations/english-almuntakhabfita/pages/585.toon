quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,"He, -the Messenger- frowned and turned away"
  80,2,When the blind man came in (and interrupted his exhortation to some of the Qurashite nobilities who tried to suppress his mission and stood in his way)
  80,3,You Muhammad do not know; he -the blind man- may well hug faith to his innermost thoughts and to his innermost being and commend his secret feelings to Allah
  80,4,Or he might ponder what he learns and profit by it
  80,5,"But he who is rich, with abundant means at command"
  80,6,"You give him attention, hoping he would submit"
  80,7,Yet you are absolved if his disbelief in Allah does not remit
  80,8,But he who comes to you seeking authoritative counsel and admonition
  80,9,With heart full of reverence and mindful of submission
  80,10,you are unmindful of him and you give him little attention
  80,11,"No indeed, but let this incident be an admonition"
  80,12,"and he who wishes, may keep Allah in mind and imprint in his heart His Glorious Quran which conduces to piety and to contrition"
  80,13,"A Quran recorded in Books, honoured and highly esteemed"
  80,14,"Exalted, absolute and pure honourably deemed"
  80,15,Recorded by Scribes emblematic of trust
  80,16,"Honourable, pious and just"
  80,17,"Accursed be man, how he fights against his own good the best he can"
  80,18,From what primordium did Allah create him
  80,19,"From a seed in fluid emitted did He create him and animate, and his dimensions and his life span, his provisions and his lot did He determine, and his intellect did He actuate"
  80,20,Then He guided him to the path of safety and righteousness and his course did He facilitate
  80,21,Then He occasioned his death and in the grave did He deposit and inanimate
  80,22,"Then when He wills, He shall resurrect him and animate"
  80,23,"But no, he never fulfilled what Allah has commanded and ordained"
  80,24,Let man take a look at his food
  80,25,We poured down rain-water in quantities which stream and flow
  80,26,Then We split the earth and break up the soil to allow water in and vegetations to grow
  80,27,Therein We grew edible grain
  80,28,Grapes and herbage
  80,29,Olive trees and palm-dates
  80,30,Gardens of perennial and other purposeful trees
  80,31,and fruits and fodder
  80,32,Sustenance for you and for your cattle
  80,33,Then when the deafening uproarious eventful Event* comes about
  80,34,Man shall then flee from his own brother
  80,35,From his mother and his father
  80,36,and from his wife and his children
  80,37,"For each of them then, there is enough trouble of his own"
  80,38,Some faces will then be beaming
  80,39,Smiling and rejoicing in all seeming
  80,40,Other faces will be coated with gloom
  80,41,A painful depressing darkness they shall assume
  80,42,These are the wicked infidels who impudently defied admonition
