quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,One whose chest (heart and mind) is left open for Islam (submission to His will) shall receive light from God. Woe to those whose hearts have become like stone against the remembrance of God. They are clearly in error
  39,23,God has revealed the best reading material in the form of a Book with similar passages which refer to each other and make the skins of those who fear their Lord shiver. Then their skins and hearts incline to the remembrance of God. This is the guidance of God. He guides whomever He wants. No one can guide those whom God has caused to go astray
  39,24,"Is there anyone who is afraid of the torment of the Day of Judgment when the unjust will be told, \"Suffer the result of your deeds"
  39,25,"Those who lived before them had also rejected Our revelations. Thus, the torment struck them and they did not even realize where it came from"
  39,26,God made them suffer humiliation in this life. Would that they knew that the torment for them in the next life will be even greater
  39,27,We have given all kinds of examples for the human being in this Quran so that perhaps he may take heed
  39,28,This Quran is a flawless reading text in the Arabic language. Perhaps they will have fear of God
  39,29,"God tells a parable in which there is a company of quarrelsome people and only one of them is well disciplined. Can they be considered as equal? It is only God who deserves all praise. In fact, most of them do not know"
  39,30,"(Muhammad), you will die and all of them will also die"
  39,31,"Then, on the Day of Judgment, all of you will present your disputes before your Lord"
