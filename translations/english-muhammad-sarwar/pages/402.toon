quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  29,46,"Do not argue with the People of the Book except only by the best manner, except the unjust among them. Tell them, \"We believe in what is revealed to us and to you. Our Lord and your Lord is one. We have submitted ourselves to His will"
  29,47,We have revealed the Book to you. Some of the People of the Book and some of the pagans also believe in it. No one rejects Our revelations except the infidels
  29,48,"You were not able to read or write before the Quran was revealed to you; otherwise, the followers of falsehood would have tried to confuse the matter"
  29,49,"In fact, the Quran consists of illustrious verses that exist in the hearts of those who have knowledge. No one rejects Our revelations except the unjust ones"
  29,50,"They say, \"Why a miracle is not sent to him from his Lord.\" Say, \"Miracles are in the hands of God. I am simply a warner"
  29,51,Is it not enough for them that We have revealed the Book to you to be recited to them. It is a mercy and a reminder for the believers
  29,52,"Say, \"God is sufficient as a witness between me and you. He knows all that is in the heavens and the earth.\" Those who have faith in falsehood and disbelieve in God are certainly lost"
