  74,49,"If such will be the Day of Judgment, what is the matter with them? Why do they run away from guidance"
  74,50,like frightened donkeys
  74,51,running away from a lion
  74,52,Is it that everyone of them wants to receive a heavenly book addressed to him personally
  74,53,"This will certainly never be the case! In fact, they are not afraid of the Day of Judgment"
  74,54,There is no doubt that the Quran is a guide
  74,55,Let anyone who seeks guidance do so
  74,56,No one will seek guidance unless God wills it. He alone is worthy of being feared and He is the Source of Forgiveness
  75,1,I swear by the Day of Resurrection
