quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  68,16,We shall brand him on his nose
  68,17,We have tested them in the same way as we tested the dwellers of the garden (in Yemen) when they swore to pluck all the fruits of the garden in the morning
  68,18,"without adding (\"if God wills)"
  68,19,A visitor from your Lord circled around the garden during the night while they were asleep
  68,20,and the garden was turned into a barren desert
  68,21,In the morning they called out to one another
  68,22,"Go early to your farms, if you want to pluck the fruits"
  68,23,"They all left, whispering to one another"
  68,24,Let no beggar come to the garden
  68,25,They were resolved to repel the beggars
  68,26,"When they saw the garden, they said, \"Surely we have lost our way"
  68,27,"(No, we are not lost.) In fact, we have been deprived of everything"
  68,28,"A reasonable one among them said, \"Did I not tell you that you should glorify God"
  68,29,"They said, \"All glory belongs to God. We have certainly been unjust"
  68,30,Some of them started to blame others
  68,31,"They said, \"Woe to us. We have been arrogant"
  68,32,Perhaps our Lord will replace it with a better garden. We turn in repentance to our Lord
  68,33,Such is the torment if only they knew that the torment in the life hereafter will certainly be greater
  68,34,The pious ones will receive a beautiful Paradise from their Lord
  68,35,Shall We treat the Muslims like criminals
  68,36,What is the matter with you? How could you judge this to be so
  68,37,Do you have a book from which you study
  68,38,that tells you to do whatever you want
  68,39,Do you have a covenant with Us which allows you to do whatever you want until the Day of Judgment
  68,40,"(Muhammad), ask which of them can guarantee that on the Day of Judgment"
  68,41,"they will receive the same thing that the Muslims will? Do they have any witness to such an agreement? Let them bring out such witness, if they are truthful"
  68,42,"On the day when the terrible torment approaches, they will be told (in a mocking way) to prostrate themselves, but they will not be able to do it"
