quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  40,67,"It is He Who created you from clay, turning it into a living germ, then into a clot of blood, and then brings you forth as a child. He then made you grow into manhood and become old. He causes some of you to live for the appointed time and some of you to die before so that perhaps you may have understanding"
  40,68,"It is He Who gives life and causes things to die. When He decides to do something, He only says, \"Exist,\" and it comes into existence"
  40,69,"Have you not seen how those who dispute the revelations of God, turn away from Truth to falsehood"
  40,70,Those who rejected the Book and the message which was given to Our Messenger will soon know (the consequences of their evil deeds)
  40,71,when fetters will be placed around their necks and chains will drag them
  40,72,into boiling water and then they will be burned in the fire
  40,73,"Then they will be asked, \"Where are the idols which you worshipped besides God"
  40,74,"They will reply, \"They have abandoned us. In fact, we had worshipped nothing\" Thus does God cause the disbelievers to go astray"
  40,75,"They will be told, \"This (torment) is the result of your unreasonable happiness on the earth and of your propagation of falsehood"
  40,76,Enter the gates of hell to live therein forever. How terrible is the dwelling of the arrogant ones
  40,77,"(Muhammad), exercise patience. The promise of God is true. Whether We let you witness the suffering with which they were threatened or because of your death (you do not see them suffering,), We shall still punish them when they return to Us (on the Day of Judgment)"
