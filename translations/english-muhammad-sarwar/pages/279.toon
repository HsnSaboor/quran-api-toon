quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,103,We know that they say a mere mortal has taught it (the Quran) to him (Muhammad). The language of the person whom they think has taught it to him is not Arabic. This (the Quran) is in illustrious Arabic
  16,104,God will not guide those who do not believe in His miracles. They will suffer a painful punishment
  16,105,Those who do not believe in the miracles of God invent lies and they are liars
  16,106,No one verbally denounces his faith in God - unless he is forced - but his heart is confident about his faith. But those whose breasts have become open to disbelief will be subject to the wrath of God and will suffer a great torment
  16,107,This is because they have given preference to this life over the life to come and God does not guide disbelieving people
  16,108,"God has sealed their hearts, ears and eyes and they are not aware of it"
  16,109,On the Day of Judgment they will certainly be lost
  16,110,"Those who left their homes for the cause of God after they had been persecuted, strove hard for His cause and exercised patience should know (even though they had verbally renounced their faith) that your Lord is All-forgiving and All-merciful"
