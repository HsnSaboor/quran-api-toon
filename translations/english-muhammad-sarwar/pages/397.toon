quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  29,7,We shall expiate the sins of the righteously striving believers and shall reward them better than their deeds
  29,8,"We have advised the human being, \"Be kind to your parents. Do not obey them if they force you to consider equal to Me things which you do not know are such.\" You will all return (to Me) and I shall show all that you have done"
  29,9,We shall admit the righteously striving believers into the company of the pious ones
  29,10,"Some people say, \"We have faith in God.\" But when they face some hardship for His cause, they begin to consider the persecution that they have experienced from people as a torment from God. When your Lord grants you a victory, they say, \"We were with you.\" Does God not know best what is in the hearts of every creature"
  29,11,God certainly knows all about the believers and the hypocrites
  29,12,"The unbelievers say to the believers. \"Follow our way. We shall take the responsibility for your sins.\" They cannot take responsibility for any of the sins. They are only liars"
