quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,none of their luxuries will be able to save them from the torment
  26,208,We never destroyed any town without first sending to them warning and guidance
  26,209,We have never been unjust to anyone
  26,210,The satans have not revealed the Quran
  26,211,they are not supposed to do so. Nor do have they the ability for such a task
  26,212,The satans are barred from listening to anything from the heavens
  26,213,"(Muhammad), do not worship anything besides God lest you suffer the punishment"
  26,214,Warn your close relatives
  26,215,and be kind to your believing followers
  26,216,"If they disobey you, tell them, \"I condemn your disobedient deeds"
  26,217,Have trust in the Majestic and All-merciful God
  26,218,who can see whether you stand up
  26,219,or move during your prostration with the worshippers
  26,220,He is All-hearing and All-knowing
  26,221,Should I tell you to whom the satans come
  26,222,They come to every sinful liar
  26,223,The satans try to listen to the heavens but many of them are liars
  26,224,Only the erring people follow the poets
  26,225,Have you not seen them wandering and bewildered in every valley
  26,226,and preaching what they themselves never practice
  26,227,The righteously striving believers among them who remember God very often and use their talent to seek help after they have been wronged are the exceptional. The unjust will soon know how terrible their end will be
