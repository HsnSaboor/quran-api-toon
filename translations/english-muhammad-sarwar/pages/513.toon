quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  48,16,"Tell the laggardly Bedouins, \"You will be called to face strong people whom you will fight right to the end or who will submit to you. If you obey the Messenger, God will give you a good reward. But if you turn away as you did before, God will make you suffer a painful torment"
  48,17,"It is not an offense for the blind, the lame, or the sick not to take part in the battle. Whoever obeys God and His Messenger will be admitted to the gardens wherein streams flow. God will make whoever turns away suffer a painful torment"
  48,18,"God is pleased with the believers for their pledging obedience to you under the tree. He knew whatever was in their hearts, thus, He granted them confidence and rewarded them with an immediate victory"
  48,19,and the booty which they received from it (the Battle). God is Majestic and All-wise
  48,20,God has promised that you will receive much booty. He has enabled you to receive this at this time and has protected you from enemies to make it an evidence (of the Truth) for the believers. He will guide you to the right path
  48,21,"Besides these, there were other gains which you could not receive, but God has full control over them. God has power over all things"
  48,22,"Had the disbelievers fought against you, they would have run away from the battle and would have found no guardian or helper"
  48,23,"This is the tradition of God which existed before, and you will never find any change in His tradition"
