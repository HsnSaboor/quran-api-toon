  59,11,"Have you not seen the hypocrites who say to their disbelieving brothers among the People of the Book, \"If you are driven out, we shall, also, leave the town with you and we shall never obey whoever seeks to harm you. If you are attacked, we shall help you.\" God testifies that they are liars"
  59,12,"If they were to be expelled, they would not go with them. If they were to be attacked they would not help them. Even if they were to help them, they would run away from the battle and leave them helpless"
  59,13,They are more afraid of you than of God. They are a people who lack understanding
  59,14,"They will not fight you united except with the protection of fortified towns or from behind walls. They are strong among themselves. You think that they are united, but in fact, their hearts are divided. They are a people who have no understanding"
  59,15,"They are like those who, a short time before, suffered the consequences of their deeds. They, too, will suffer a painful torment"
  59,16,"They are like satan who said to people, \"Reject the faith,\" but when the people rejected the faith he said, \"I have nothing to do with you. I fear the Lord of the Universe"
