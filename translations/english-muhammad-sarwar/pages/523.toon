  51,52,In the same way no Messenger came to those who lived before them without his people calling him a magician or an insane person
  51,53,Have they inherited such dealings with the Prophets from their predecessors or are they a rebellious people
  51,54,"(Muhammad), leave them alone and you will not be blamed"
  51,55,Keep on reminding them. This benefits the believers
  51,56,We have created jinn and human beings only that they might worship Me
  51,57,I do not expect to receive any sustenance from them or that they should feed Me
  51,58,It is God Who is the Sustainer and the Lord of invincible strength
  51,59,The unjust will bear a burden like that of their unjust predecessors. Let them not make Me bring immediate punishment upon them
  51,60,Woe to the disbelievers when the day with which they have been threatened comes
  52,1,By the Mount (Sinai)
  52,2,by the book (Torah) written
  52,3,on parchment for distribution
  52,4,by the established House (Mecca)
  52,5,by the high ceiling (heaven)
  52,6,and by the swelling ocean
  52,7,the torment of your Lord will inevitably take place
  52,8,and no one will be able to prevent it
  52,9,On the day when the heavens will swiftly fly
  52,10,and the mountains quickly move
  52,11,Woe will be to those who rejected the Truth
  52,12,and who indulged in false disputes against (God's revelations)
  52,13,On that day they will be violently pushed into the fire
  52,14,"and they will be told, \"This is the fire which you called a lie"
