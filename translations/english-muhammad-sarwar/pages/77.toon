quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,1,"People, have fear of your Lord who has created you from a single soul. From it He created your spouse and through them He populated the land with many men and women. Have fear of the One by whose Name you swear to settle your differences and have respect for your relatives. God certainly keeps watch over you"
  4,2,Give to the orphans their property. Do not exchange the pure for the filthy and do not spend the property of orphans along with your own; this would be a great sin
  4,3,"With respect to marrying widows, if you are afraid of not being able to maintain justice with her children, marry another woman of your choice or two or three or four (who have no children). If you cannot maintain equality with more than one wife, marry only one or your slave-girl. This keeps you from acting against justice"
  4,4,"Pay the women their dowry as though it were a gift. However, if they allow you to keep a part of it as a favor to you, you may spend it with pleasure"
  4,5,Do not give to people weak of understanding your property for which God has made you to supervise. Feed and clothe such people and speak to them in a reasonable way
  4,6,"Before returning orphan's property to them, make sure that they have reached maturity. Do not consume their property wastefully until such a time. The rich (guardian) should not take any of his ward's property. However, a poor (guardian) may use a reasonable portion. When you return their property, make sure you have witness. God is a perfect in taking accounts"
