quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,God has made devoid of all virtue the deeds of those who have disbelieved and prevented others from the way of God
  47,2,God forgives the sins and reforms the hearts of the righteously striving believers who have faith in what is revealed to Muhammad - which is the Truth from his Lord
  47,3,This is because the disbelievers have followed falsehood and the believers have followed the Truth from their Lord. Thus God explains to the human being their own prospects
  47,4,"If you encounter the disbelievers in a battle, strike-off their heads. Take them as captives when they are defeated. Then you may set them free as a favor to them, with or without a ransom, when the battle is over. This is the Law. Had God wanted, He could have granted them (unbelievers) victory, but He wants to test you through each other. The deeds of those who are killed for the cause of God will never be without virtuous results"
  47,5,God will lead them to everlasting happiness and improve their condition
  47,6,He will admit them into the Paradise which He has made known to them
  47,7,"Believers, if you help God, He will help you and make you steadfast (in your faith)"
  47,8,The fate of the disbelievers will be to stumble and their deeds will have no virtuous results
  47,9,"they have hated God's revelation, and thus, He has made their deeds devoid of all virtue"
  47,10,Have they not travelled through the land and seen the terrible end of those who lived before them? God brought upon them utter destruction and the disbelievers will also faced similar perdition
  47,11,"God is the guardian of the believers, but the disbelievers have no guardian"
