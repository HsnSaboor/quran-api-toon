quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,41,"My people, \"How strange is it that I invite you to salvation when you invite me to the fire"
  40,42,You call me to disbelieve in God and to believe other things equal to Him about which I have no knowledge. I call you to the Majestic and All-forgiving One
  40,43,The idols to which you invite me certainly have no claim to be deities in this world or in the life to come. Our return is to God and the transgressors will be the dwellers of hell fire
  40,44,You will soon recall what I have told you. I entrust God with my affairs. God is Well Aware of His servants
  40,45,God protected him against their evil plans and the people of the Pharaoh were struck by the most horrible torment
  40,46,"They will be exposed to the fire in the mornings and the evenings and on the Day of Judgment, they will be told, \"People of the Pharaoh, suffer the most severe torment"
  40,47,"During a dispute in the fire, the suppressed ones will say to those who had dominated them, \"We were your followers. Can you now relieve us of our suffering in the fire"
  40,48,"The ones who had dominated them will say, \"All of us are now in hell. God has already issued His Judgment of His servants (and no one can change this)"
  40,49,"The dwellers of hell fire will ask its keepers, \"Pray to your Lord to relieve us from the torment at least for one day"
