quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,39,Further evidence is that (at times) you find the earth to be barren. When it is watered it moves and swells (to let the plants grow). The One who brings it back to life will also bring the dead back to life. He has power over all things
  41,40,Those who deviate from Our revelations are not hidden from Us. Is the one who will be thrown into hell fire better than the one who will be brought safely into the presence of God on the Day of Judgment? Act as you wish; God is Well-Aware of whatever you do
  41,41,The disbelievers (do not know) that the Quran which was sent to them is certainly a glorious Book
  41,42,"Falsehood can not reach it from any direction. It is the revelation from the All-wise, Praiseworthy One"
  41,43,"Nothing has been said to you which was not said to the Messengers who lived before you. Your Lord is certainly All-forgiving, but stern in His retribution"
  41,44,"Had We sent down this Quran in a non-Arabic language, they would have said, \"Why have its verses not been well expounded?\" Could a non-Arabic Book be revealed to an Arabic speaking person? (Muhammad), say, \"It is a guide and a cure for the believers. As for those who do not believe, they are deaf and blind. It is as though they had been called from a distant place"
  41,45,"We had given the Book to Moses about which people greatly disagreed. Had the word of your Lord not been decreed, He would have certainly settled their differences (there and then). They were greatly suspicious and doubtful about the Book of Moses"
  41,46,Whoever acts righteously does so for his own good and whoever commits evil does so against his soul. Your Lord is not unjust to His servants
