quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  30,33,"When people face hardship, they begin praying to their Lord and turn in repentance to Him. When they receive mercy from Him, a group of them begin to consider things equal to God"
  30,34,"because of their ingratitude for what We have given them. Let them enjoy themselves, but they will soon know (the consequences of their deeds)"
  30,35,Have We sent them any authority to speak in support of their idols
  30,36,"When people receive mercy, they are happy with it. However, when hardship befalls them because of their own deeds, they despair"
  30,37,Have they not seen how God increases the livelihood of whomever He wants and determines his share. In this there is evidence (of the truth) for the believing people
  30,38,"Give the relatives, the destitute, and the needy travellers their share (of charity). It is better for those who want to please God and they will have everlasting happiness"
  30,39,God will not allow to increase whatever illegal interest you try to receive in order to increase your wealth at the expense of people's property. Whatever amount of zakat you give to please God will be doubled (for you)
  30,40,It is God who has created you and given you sustenance. He will make you die and will bring you back to life. Can any of your idols do such things? God is too Exalted to be considered equal to anything else
  30,41,Evil has spread over the land and the sea because of human deeds and through these God will cause some people to suffer so that perhaps they will return to Him
