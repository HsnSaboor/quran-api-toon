  23,60,"who spend their property for the cause of God, and whose hearts are afraid of their return"
  23,61,"to God, these are the ones who really compete with each other in virtuous deeds and are the foremost ones in the task"
  23,62,We do not impose on any soul what is beyond its capacity. We have the Book which speaks the truth and no injustice will be done to it

  23,64,"But when We will strike with torment those (unbelievers) who are rich, they will start to cry for help"
  23,65,"We shall tell them, \"Do not cry for help on this day; you will receive none from Us"
  23,66,"Our revelations had certainly been recited to you, but you turned your backs to them"
