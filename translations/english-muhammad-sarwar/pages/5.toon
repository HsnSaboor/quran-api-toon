quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,25,"(Muhammad), tell the righteously striving believers of the happy news, that for them there are gardens wherein streams flow. Whenever they get any fruit from the gardens as food, they will say, \"This is just what we had before (we came here). These fruits are produced very much like them (those we had before).\" They will have purified spouses and it is they who will live forever"
  2,26,"God does not hesitate to set forth parables of anything even a gnat. The believers know that it is the truth from their Lord, but those who deny the truth say, \"What does God mean by such parables?\" In fact, by such parables God misleads and guides many. However, He only misleads the evil doers"
  2,27,who break their established covenant with Him and the relations He has commanded to be kept and who spread evil in the land. These are the ones who lose a great deal
  2,28,How dare you deny the existence of God Who gave you life when you initially had no life. He will cause you to die and bring you to life again. Then you will return to His Presence
  2,29,"It is He who created everything on earth for you. Then, directing His order towards the realm above, He turned it into seven heavens. He has knowledge of all things"
