quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,though they may see each other. A sinner will wish that he could save himself from the torment of that day by sacrificing his children
  70,12,"his wife, his brother"
  70,13,his kinsmen who gave him refuge (from hardship)
  70,14,and all those on earth
  70,15,By no means! For the raging flames of the fire
  70,16,will strip-off the flesh
  70,17,and drag into it anyone who has turned away (from obeying God)
  70,18,and who accumulated wealth without spending it for a good purpose
  70,19,Human beings are created greedy
  70,20,"When they are afflicted, they complain"
  70,21,"but when they are fortunate, they become niggardly"
  70,22,except those who are steadfast
  70,23,and constant in their prayers
  70,24,They are those who assign a certain share of their property
  70,25,for the needy and the deprived
  70,26,who acknowledge the Day of Judgment
  70,27,who are afraid of the torment of their Lord
  70,28,the punishment of their Lord is not something for them to feel secure of
  70,29,who guard their carnal desires
  70,30,"except from their wives and slave girls, in which case they are not to be blamed"
  70,31,but whoever goes beyond this is a transgressor
  70,32,who honor their trust and promises
  70,33,who testify to what they have witnessed
  70,34,and (finally) those who do not miss their ritual - prayers at the prescribed times
  70,35,such people will receive due honor in Paradise
  70,36,What is wrong with the disbelievers who roam around you (Muhammad)
  70,37,"left and right, in numerous groups"
  70,38,Does every one of them desire to enter the bountiful Paradise
  70,39,"By no means! For they know very well out of what We have created them (The human being's naturally growing from a living germ, without discipline and good deeds will not result in virtue)"
