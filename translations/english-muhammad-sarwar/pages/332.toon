quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  22,1,"People, have fear of your Lord; the quake (of the physical realm) at the Hour of Doom will be terribly violent"
  22,2,"When that hour comes, every breast-feeding mother will drop her baby out of fear and every pregnant female will cast off her burden. You will see the people behaving as though they were drunk, while, in fact, they are not drunk. They only will look such because of the severity of God's torment"
  22,3,Some people argue about God without knowledge and follow every rebellious devil
  22,4,It has been decided that satan will mislead and submit anyone who establishes friendship with him to the torment of the burning fire
  22,5,"People, if you have doubts about the Resurrection, you must know that We created you from clay that was turned into a living germ. This was developed into a clot of blood, which was made into a well formed and partly shapeless lump of flesh. This is how We show you that resurrection is not more difficult for Us than your creation. We cause whatever We want to stay in the womb for an appointed time, We then take you out of the womb as a baby, so that you may grow up and receive strength. Some of you may then die and others may grow to a very old age and lose your memory. You may see the earth as a barren land, but when we send rain, it starts to stir and swell and produce various pairs of attractive herbs"
