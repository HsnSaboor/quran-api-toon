  78,35,They will not hear therein any unnecessary words or lies
  78,36,"This will be their reward from your Lord, a favor from Him and a recompense for their deeds"
  78,37,He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. He is the Beneficent God and no one will be able to address Him
  78,38,"On that day, the Spirit and the angels who stand in lines will not speak except those whom the Beneficent God has permitted, and he will speak the right words"
