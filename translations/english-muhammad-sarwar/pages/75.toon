quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,187,"When God made a covenant with the People of the Book saying, \"Tell the people about it (Muhammad's prophesy) without hiding any part, therefrom, they threw it behind their backs and sold it for a very small price. What a miserable bargain"
  3,188,Do not think that those who are happy with their possessions and positions and those who love to be praised for what they themselves have not done can ever be saved from torment. For them there will be a painful punishment
  3,189,To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and He has power over all things
  3,190,The creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the day and the night are evidence (of the existence of God) for people of reason
  3,191,"It is these who commemorate God while standing, sitting, or resting on their sides and who think about the creation of the heavens and the earth and say, \"Lord, you have not created all this without reason. Glory be to you. Lord, save us from the torment of the fire"
  3,192,Those whom You submit to the fire are certainly disgraced. There is no helper for the unjust
  3,193,"Lord, we have heard the person calling to the faith and have accepted his call. Forgive our sins, expiate our bad deeds, and let us die with the righteous ones"
  3,194,"Lord, grant us the victory that You have promised your Messenger and do not disgrace us on the Day of Judgment; You are the One who never ignores His promise"
