quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,when his Lord called him in the holy valley of Tuwa
  79,17,"saying, \"Go to the Pharaoh. He has transgressed beyond all bounds"
  79,18,"And say to him, \"Would you like to reform yourself"
  79,19,I shall guide you to your Lord so that you may perhaps have fear of Him
  79,20,Moses showed him the great miracle
  79,21,but the Pharaoh rejected it and disobeyed (Moses)
  79,22,Then he turned away in a hurry
  79,23,and gathered his people together
  79,24,"saying, \"I am your supreme lord"
  79,25,So God struck him with the torment of this life and the life hereafter
  79,26,In this there is a lesson for those who have fear of God
  79,27,"(People), is your creation harder for God than that of the heavens, which He created, raised and established"
  79,28,high above
  79,29,He has made its nights dark and its days bright
  79,30,"After this, He spread out the earth"
  79,31,produced water and grass therefrom
  79,32,then set-up firmly the mountains
  79,33,All this was done as a means of enjoyment for you and your cattle
  79,34,On the day when the great calamity comes
  79,35,the human being will recall whatever he has done
  79,36,Hell fire will become visible for those who would see it
  79,37,Those who have rebelled
  79,38,and preferred the worldly life
  79,39,hell will be their dwelling
  79,40,"However, those who had feared their Lord and restrained their souls from acting according to its desires"
  79,41,Paradise will be the dwelling
  79,42,"(Muhammad), they ask you, \"When will the Hour of Doom come"
  79,43,"(Muhammad), you do not know (when and how) it will come"
  79,44,This matter is in the hands of your Lord
  79,45,You are only a warner for those who fear such a day
  79,46,"On the day when they see it, it will seem to them as though they had only lived in the world for a morning and an afternoon"
