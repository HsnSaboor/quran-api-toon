quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  3,154,"After the sorrows you suffered, He sent you relief and some of you were encompassed by slumber. To some others of you, your lives were so important that you, like ignorant people, began thinking suspiciously of God saying, \"Do we have any say in the matter?\" (Muhammad), tell them, \"All matters belong to God.\" They try to hide within their souls what they do not reveal to you. They say, \"Had we had the matter in our hands, we would not have been killed there.\" Tell them, \"Even if you had stayed in your own homes, your sworn enemies could have attacked you and slain you while you were in your beds. God wanted to test you and purge what existed in your hearts"
  3,155,"God knows what the hearts contain. Because of some of your bad deeds, those of you who ran away, when you faced the enemy, were misled by Satan. God forgave you for He is All-forgiving and Forbearing"
  3,156,"Believers, do not be like the unbelievers, who said of their brothers who travelled in the land or took part in a fight, \"Had they stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed.\" God will only cause regret to enter their hearts. It is God who gives life and causes people to die. God is Well Aware of what you do"
  3,157,"If you were to die or to be killed for the cause of God, certainly His forgiveness and mercy is far better than your worldly gains"
