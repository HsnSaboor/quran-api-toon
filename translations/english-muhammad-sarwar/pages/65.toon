quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,116,The wealth and the children of the unbelievers can never make them independent of God. They are the dwellers of hell wherein they will live forever
  3,117,"What they spend in this life is like the freezing wind that may strike and destroy the farms of the people who have wronged themselves. God has not done injustice to them, but they have wronged themselves"
  3,118,"Believers, do not expose your privacy to the unbelievers. They like to mislead you and see that you are seriously harmed. Signs of animosity from their mouths have already become audible, but what they hide in their heads is even worse. We have certainly made Our evidence clear, if only you would consider it"
  3,119,"There are people whom you love, but they do not love you, despite your belief in all the (heavenly) Books. On meeting you They proclaim belief on meeting you, but in private, bite their fingers at you in anger. Tell them, \"Perish in your rage! God knows well what is in everyone's hearts"
  3,120,"They hate to see your success and rejoice if any misfortune befalls you. If you will be patient and pious, their plots can cause no harm to you. God has control over all their actions"
  3,121,"(Muhammad), remember the morning when you left home to show the believers their position in the battle? God is All-hearing and All-knowing"
