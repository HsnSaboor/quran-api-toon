quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and then turned away
  80,2,from a blind man who had come up to him
  80,3,You never know. Perhaps he wanted to purify himself
  80,4,or receive some (Quranic) advice which would benefit him
  80,5,Yet you pay attention
  80,6,to a rich man
  80,7,though you will not be questioned even if he never purifies himself
  80,8,As for the one who comes to you earnestly (striving for guidance)
  80,9,and who has fear of God
  80,10,you ignore him
  80,11,These verses are a reminder
  80,12,so let those who want to follow its guidance do so
  80,13,(This Quran) is also recorded in honorable books
  80,14,"exalted, purified"
  80,15,"by the hands of the noble, virtuous"
  80,16,and angelic scribes
  80,17,May (the disbelieving) human being be condemned! What makes him disbelieve
  80,18,From what has God created him
  80,19,He created him from a living germ. He determined his fate
  80,20,and made the path of guidance easy for him to follow
  80,21,Then He caused him to die and be buried
  80,22,and He will resurrect him whenever He wants
  80,23,"Certainly, he has not duly fulfilled His commands"
  80,24,Let the human being think about (how We produce) his food
  80,25,We send down abundant water
  80,26,and let the earth to break open
  80,27,to yield therein corn
  80,28,"grapes, vegetables"
  80,29,"olives, dates"
  80,30,thickly planted gardens
  80,31,"fruits, and grass"
  80,32,(These are made so as to be) means of enjoyment for you and your cattle
  80,33,When the trumpet sounds
  80,34,it will be such a day when a person will run away from his brother
  80,35,"mother, father"
  80,36,wife and sons
  80,37,for on that day everyone will be completely engrossed in his own concerns
  80,38,Some faces on that day will be radiant
  80,39,laughing and joyous
  80,40,but others will be gloomy
  80,41,and covered by darkness
  80,42,These will be the faces of the sinful disbelievers
