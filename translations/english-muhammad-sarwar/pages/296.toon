quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,21,"We caused their story to become public so that people would know that God's promise was true and that there is no doubt about the coming of the Day of Judgment. They started to argue with each other about the matter (Resurrection) and some of them said, \"Let us establish a building at the youths' sleeping place (to hide them). Their Lord knew best their intentions about them. The majority prevailed in their suggestion of the establishment of a mosque in that place"
  18,22,"(With regard to the number of the youths) some say, \"There were three and the dog was the fourth one,\" Others say, \"There were five and the dog was the sixth one.\" In reality, they are just feeling around in the dark. Still some of them say, \"There were seven and the dog was the eighth one.\" (Muhammad), say, \"My Lord has the best knowledge of their number. You know very little about it.\" Do not insist on arguing with them, but merely tell them the story as it has been revealed to you and do not ask anyone about them"
  18,23,"Never say of something, \"I shall do it tomorrow"
  18,24,"without adding, \"if God wills.\" Recall your Lord if you forget to do something. Say, \"I hope that my Lord will provide me better guidance"
  18,25,"They, in fact, stayed in the cave for three hundred plus nine further years"
  18,26,"(Muhammad), say, \"God knows best how long they stayed there; to Him belongs the unseen of both the heavens and the earth. How clear is His sight and how keen His hearing! No one other than Him is their guardian and no one shares His Judgment"
  18,27,Read whatever is revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. No one can change His words and you can never find any refuge other than Him
