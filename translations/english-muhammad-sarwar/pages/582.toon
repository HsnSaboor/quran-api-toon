quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,What do they quarrel about
  78,2,They quarrel about the great news
  78,3,concerning which they have disputes
  78,4,(What they think is certainly despicable!). They will soon come to know (the reality)
  78,5,"Yes, indeed, before long they will learn all about it"
  78,6,Have We not made the earth as a place to rest
  78,7,and the mountains as pegs (to anchor the earth)
  78,8,Have We not created you in pairs
  78,9,made sleep for you to rest
  78,10,made the night as a covering
  78,11,and the day as time for you to make a living
  78,12,Have We not made seven strong heavens above you
  78,13,(the sun) as a shining torch
  78,14,and sent down heavy rains from the clouds
  78,15,"to make the seeds, plants"
  78,16,and thick gardens grow
  78,17,The Day of Judgment will certainly be the final appointment
  78,18,On that day the trumpet will be sounded and you will come (to Us) in huge groups
  78,19,The heavens will have openings like doors
  78,20,The mountains will be driven away and become like mirages
  78,21,Hell will lie in wait (for its prey)
  78,22,It will be a place of return
  78,23,for the rebellious ones and they will live therein for ages
  78,24,They will not feel cold nor taste any drink
  78,25,except boiling water and pus
  78,26,as a fitting recompense for their deeds
  78,27,They did not expect such a Judgment
  78,28,and persistently rejected Our revelations
  78,29,"However, We have recorded everything in a book"
  78,30,"(They will be told), \"Suffer, We shall only increase the torment for you"
