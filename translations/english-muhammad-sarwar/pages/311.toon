quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Note the words of the disbeliever, \"I shall certainly be given wealth and children"
  19,78,Has he the knowledge of the unseen or has the Beneficent God established such a binding agreement with Him
  19,79,"Absolutely not, We will record his words and prolong his punishment"
  19,80,"All that he speaks of will belong to Us, and he will come into Our presence all alone"
  19,81,They have sought honor from other gods instead of God
  19,82,"In fact, they can have no honor; their gods will renounce their worship of idols and will turn against them"
  19,83,Do you not realize that We have sent Satan to incite the unbelievers to sin
  19,84,"(Muhammad), exercise patience; We have given them respite only for an appointed time"
  19,85,"On the Day of Judgment, when the pious people will be brought into the presence of the Beneficent God as the guests of honor"
  19,86,and the criminals will be driven and thrown into hell
  19,87,no one will be able to intercede for the others except those whom the Beneficent God has given authority
  19,88,They have said that the Beneficent God has given birth to a son
  19,89,This is certainly a monstrous lie
  19,90,"This would almost cause the heavens to rent apart, the earth to cleave asunder and the mountains to crumble down in fragments"
  19,91,to ascribe a son to the Beneficent God
  19,92,The Beneficent God is too Exalted to have a son
  19,93,All that is in the heavens and the earth will return to the Beneficent God as His submissive servants
  19,94,He has counted and enumerated them one by one
  19,95,Everyone on the Day of Judgment will individually come into the presence of God
