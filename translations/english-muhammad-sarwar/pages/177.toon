quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,1,"They (the believers) ask you (Muhammad) about the booty captured (from the enemies) during a war. Tell them, \"It belongs to God and the Messengers. If you have faith, have fear of God. Settle the disputes among yourselves and obey God and His Messengers"
  8,2,"When God is mentioned, the true believers begin to feel fear of Him in their hearts and when His revelations are recited to them their faith strengthens. In God alone do they trust"
  8,3,They are steadfast in prayer and spend part of what We have given them for the cause of God
  8,4,"Such are the true believers. Their reward from their Lord will be high ranks, forgiveness, and a generous provision"
  8,5,A group among the believers dislike (God's decree about the booty captured in war) as well as His command that you come out of your home for a truthful purpose (to fight for justice)
  8,6,"Knowing it well (that a fight in which they are to take part is about to take place), they act as though they are being driven to death which they can see before their very eyes. Despite their knowledge of the truth, they still argue with you"
  8,7,"When God promised to grant you (believers) victory over either one of the two groups, you wished to have control over the unarmed one. God decided to prove (to you) the truth of His promises and to destroy the unbelievers"
  8,8,"so that the truth would stand supreme and falsehood would exist no more, even though the criminals dislike it"
