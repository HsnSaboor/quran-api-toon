quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  42,1,Ha. Mim
  42,2,Ayn. Sin. Qaf
  42,3,"(Muhammad), this is how God, the Majestic and All-wise, sends revelations to you and sent them to those who lived before you"
  42,4,To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. He is the Most High and the Most Great
  42,5,"(When the revelation passes through) the heavens, they almost break apart. At that time the angels glorify their Lord with His praise and seek forgiveness for those who live on earth. God is certainly All-forgiving and All-merciful"
  42,6,"God is the guardian of even those who have chosen others (idols) besides Him as their guardians (Muhammad), you will not have to answer for them"
  42,7,We have revealed the Quran to you in the Arabic language so that you could warn the people of the Mother Town (Mecca) and those around it of the inevitable Day of Resurrection when some will go to Paradise and others to hell
  42,8,"Had God wanted, He could have made them all one single nation, but He grants mercy to whomever He wills. The unjust will have no guardian or helper"
  42,9,Have they chosen other guardians besides Him? God is the real Guardian and it is He who will bring the dead back to life. He has power over all things
  42,10,"Whatever differences you may have about the Quran, the final decision rests with God. In Him do I trust and to Him do I turn in repentance"
