  17,29,Do not be stingy nor over generous lest you become empty handed and bankrupt
  17,30,Your Lord increases and determines the sustenance of whomever He wants. He is Well Aware and watches over His servants
  17,31,Do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We will give sustenance to all of you. To kill them is certainly a great sin

  17,33,"Do not kill a respectable soul without a just cause. If anyone is wrongfully killed, we have given the heirs of that person the right (to demand satisfaction or to forgive). He must not exceed the law in having vengeance; his victim shall also be assisted (by law)"
  17,34,Do not get close to the property of the orphans (unless it is for a good reason) until they are mature and strong. Keep your promise; you will be questioned about it

  17,37,Do not walk proudly on the earth; your feet cannot tear apart the earth nor are you as tall as the mountains
  17,38,All such things are sins and detestable in the sight of your Lord
