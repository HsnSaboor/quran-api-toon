quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,36,Only those who have understanding will accept your faith. (Those who have no understanding) are like the dead whom God will resurrect and to Him will all return
  6,37,"They say, \"Why have not some miracles been given to him, (Muhammad), from his Lord.\" Tell them, (Muhammad), \"God certainly has the Power to show such miracles but many of them are ignorant"
  6,38,"All the beasts on land and flying birds have different communities, just as you (people) do. Nothing is left without a mention in the Book. They will all be brought into the presence of their Lord"
  6,39,"Those who disbelieve Our revelations are, in fact, deaf and dumb. They wander in darkness. God leads astray or guides to the right path whomever He wants"
  6,40,"(Muhammad), say to them, \"Should God afflict you with torment, or should the Day of Judgment arrive, if what you claim is true, could you then seek help from any one other than God"
  6,41,You will certainly ask Him for help. He will save you from hardship if He decides to do so and you will forget all about your gods
  6,42,We had sent (Our guidance) to the nations who lived before you and afflicted them with distress and adversity so that they might submit themselves (to God)
  6,43,"Why did they not submit themselves (to God) when Our torment struck them. Instead, their hearts were hardened and Satan made their evil deeds seem attractive to them"
  6,44,"When they forgot (all) the advice that they had received, We granted them all means of happiness but they were left in despair when We suddenly took Our bounties back from them"
