quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  62,9,"Believers, on Friday when the call for prayer is made, try to attend prayer (remembering God) and leave off all business. This would be better for you if only you knew it"
  62,10,"When the prayer ends, disperse through the land and seek the favor of God. Remember Him often so that perhaps you will have everlasting happiness"
  62,11,"When they see some merchandise or some sport, they rush towards it and leave you alone standing. Say, \"(God's rewards for good deeds) are better than merriment or merchandise; God is the best Sustainer"
  63,1,"When the hypocrites come to you, they say, \"We testify that you are the Messenger of God.\" God knows that you are His Messenger. God testifies that they hypocrites are liars"
  63,2,They have chosen their oaths as a shield for them to obstruct others from the way of God. How terrible is what they do
  63,3,"This is because they accepted the faith and then rejected it. God has sealed their hearts, thus, they do not have any understanding"
  63,4,"Their physical appearance attracts you when you see them and when they speak, you carefully listen to them. In fact, they are like propped up hollow trunks of wood (They are so cowardly) they think that every cry which they hear is against them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. May God condemn them. Where are they turning to, leaving behind the Truth"
