quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,Some of us are Muslims and some of us have deviated from the Truth. Whoever has embraced Islam has followed the right guidance
  72,15,"However, the deviators from the Truth will be the fuel for hell"
  72,16,"Had they (jinn and mankind) remained steadfast in their religion (Islam), We would certainly have given them abundant water to drink"
  72,17,as a trial for them. God will make those who disregard the guidance from their Lord suffer increasing torment
  72,18,All the parts of the body to be placed on the ground during prostration belong to God
  72,19,Do not prostrate before anyone other than Him. When the servant of God (Muhammad) preached (his message) the jinn would all crowd around him
  72,20,"(Muhammad), say, \"I worship only my Lord and do not consider anyone equal to Him"
  72,21,"Say, \"I do not possess any power to harm or benefit you"
  72,22,"Say, \"No one can protect me from God, nor can I find any place of refuge but with him"
  72,23,"My only (means of protection) is to convey the message of God. Whoever disobeys God and His Messenger will go to hell, wherein he will live forever"
  72,24,"(On the Day of Judgment) when the disbelievers witness that with which they have been threatened, they will then know whose helpers are weaker and fewer in number"
  72,25,"(Muhammad), say, \"I do not know whether that with which you have been threatened is close by or whether my Lord will prolong the time of its coming"
  72,26,He knows the unseen and He does not allow anyone to know His secrets except those of His Messengers whom He chooses
  72,27,He causes angelic guards to march before and after him
  72,28,(Messenger) so that He would know that the Messengers have conveyed the message of their Lord. He encompasses all that is with them and He keeps a precise account of all things
