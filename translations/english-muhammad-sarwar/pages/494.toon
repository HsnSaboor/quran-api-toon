quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  43,61,"(Muhammad), tell them, \"Jesus is a sign of the Hour of Doom. Have no doubt about it and follow me; this is the straight path"
  43,62,Let satan not prevent you from the right path. He is your sworn enemy
  43,63,"When Jesus came with clear proof (in support of his truthfulness), he said, \"I have come to you with wisdom to clarify for you some of the matters in which you have disputes. Have fear of God and obey me"
  43,64,"God is your Lord and my Lord, so worship Him. This is the right path"
  43,65,But certain groups created differences among themselves. Woe to the unjust. They will face a painful torment
  43,66,Are they waiting for the Hour of Doom when the torment will suddenly strike them and they will not even realize from where it came
  43,67,All intimate friends on that day will become each others enemies except for the pious
  43,68,"whom God will tell, \"My servants, you need have no fear on this day, nor will you be grieved"
  43,69,Those who have faith in Our revelations and have submitted themselves to Our will
  43,70,"will be told, \"Enter Paradise with your spouses in delight"
  43,71,Golden dishes and cups will be passed among them. All that the souls may desire and that may delight their eyes will be available therein. You will live therein forever
  43,72,This is the Paradise which you have received as your inheritance by virtue of what you have done
  43,73,You will have abundant fruits therein to consume
