quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  45,14,Tell the believers to forgive those who do not have faith in the days of God (Day of Judgment) and Resurrection. God will give due recompense to all the people for their deeds
  45,15,One who acts righteously does so for his own benefit and one who commits evil does so against his own soul. To your Lord you will all return
  45,16,"We gave the Book to the Israelites, the commandments, and prophethood, granted them pure sustenance, and gave them preference above all people"
  45,17,We also gave them clear evidence in support of the true religion. Only after having received knowledge did they create differences among themselves because of their rebelliousness. Your Lord will issue His decree concerning their differences on the Day of Judgment
  45,18,We have established for you a code of conduct and a religion. Follow it and do not follow the desires of the ignorant people
  45,19,"They will never be sufficient (protection) for you in place of God. The unjust are each other's friends, but God is the guardian of the pious ones"
  45,20,This (Quran) is an enlightenment for the people and a guide and mercy for the people who have strong faith
  45,21,Do the people who commit evil think that We shall make their life and death like that of the righteously striving believers? How terrible is their Judgment
  45,22,God has created the heavens and the earth for a genuine purpose so that every soul will be duly recompensed for its deeds without being wronged
