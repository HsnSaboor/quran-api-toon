quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,59,"We did not abstain from sending miracles to any of Our Messengers. These miracles were called lies by the people who lived in ancient times. To the people of Thamud, We sent the she-camel as a visible miracle and they did injustice to it. We only send miracles as warnings"
  17,60,"(Muhammad), We told you that your Lord has encompassed all mankind. We made the vision which We showed you and the condemned tree, mentioned in the Quran, as a trial for the human being. Even though We warn them, it only increases their rebellion"
  17,61,"When We told the angels to prostrate before Adam, they all obeyed, except Iblis who said, \"Should I prostrate before one whom You have created out of clay"
  17,62,"He continued, \"Remember, this one whom you have honored more than me I shall bring him and most of his offspring under my sway if you will give me respite until the Day of Judgment"
  17,63,"God said, \"Go away. All those who follow you will have hell as ample recompense for their deeds"
  17,64,"Draw anyone of them you can into sin by your voice and by your cavalry and infantry, share their property and children with them and make promises to them. Your promises are all lies"
  17,65,You have no authority over My servants. Your Lord is a Sufficient Protector
  17,66,Your Lord who causes the ships to sail on the sea so that you may seek His bounty is certainly All-merciful to you
