quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,Triumphant indeed are the believers
  23,2,who are submissive to God in their prayers
  23,3,who avoid impious talks
  23,4,pay their religious tax
  23,5,and restrain their carnal desires
  23,6,except with their spouses and slave-girls. The practice of carnal relations is lawful with them
  23,7,Those who desire to go beyond such limits they commit transgression
  23,8,those who are true to their trust
  23,9,to their promise
  23,10,and who are steadfast in their prayer
  23,11,These are the heirs of Paradise wherein they will live forever
  23,12,We have created the human being from an extract of clay
  23,13,which was then turned into a living germ and placed in safe depository
  23,14,"The living germ, then, was turned into a shapeless lump of flesh from which bones were formed. The bones, then, were covered with flesh. At this stage, We caused it to become another creature. All blessings belong to God, the best Creator"
  23,15,Thereafter you will certainly die
  23,16,and you will be brought back to life again on the Day of Resurrection
  23,17,We have created seven heavens above you and have never been neglectful to Our Creation
