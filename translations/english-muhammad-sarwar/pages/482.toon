quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"It is He who has the knowledge of the Hour of Doom and the fruits that will come out of their covering. He knows what the females conceive and deliver. On the day when the unbelievers will be asked, \"Where are the idols which you considered equal to God?,\" they will reply, \"We declare that none of us have seen them"
  41,48,Whatever they had worshipped before will disappear and they will then know that there is no way for them to escape
  41,49,"The human being never tires of asking for good, but if he is afflicted by hardship, he despairs and gives up all hope"
  41,50,"When We grant him mercy after his suffering, he (boldly) says, \"This is what I deserved. I do not think that there will ever be a Day of Judgment. Even if I will be returned to my Lord, I shall still deserve to receive better rewards from Him.\" We shall certainly tell the unbelievers about their deeds and cause them to suffer a severe punishment"
  41,51,"When We grant the human being a favor, he ignores it and turns away but when he is afflicted by hardship, he starts lengthy prayers"
  41,52,"Say, \"Think, if the (Quran) is from God and you have rejected it, then who has gone farther astray than the one who has wandered far from the truth"
  41,53,We shall (continue to) show them Our evidence in the world and within their souls until it becomes clear that the Quran is the truth. Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord witness all things
  41,54,They are certainly doubtful about their meeting with their Lord. God indeed encompasses all things
