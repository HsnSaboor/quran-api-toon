quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,35,"The pagans had said, \"Had God wanted we would not have worshipped anything other than Him, nor would our fathers. We would not have forbidden anything without (a command from) Him.\" The same thing was said by the people who lived before them. Are the Messengers expected to do more than just preach"
  16,36,"To every nation We sent a Messenger who told its people, \"Worship God and stay away from satan.\" Some of them were guided by God and others were doomed to go astray. Travel through the land and see how terrible was the end for those who rejected the truth"
  16,37,"(Muhammad), even though you have a strong desire to guide them, be sure that God will not guide those who have gone astray and no one will be able to help them"
  16,38,They strongly swear by God that God will not bring the dead to life. God's promise (of the Resurrection) will certainly come true but many people do not know
  16,39,(Through the resurrection) God wants to make a clear distinction between right and wrong and make the unbelievers know that they were liars
  16,40,"When We want to bring something into existence, Our command is, \"Exist,\" and it comes into existence"
  16,41,"God settles those who leave their homes for His cause after having suffered injustice, in a prosperous dwelling in this life and greater rewards will be theirs in the life to come. Would that they knew this"
  16,42,(It is they) who have exercised patience and trust in their Lord
