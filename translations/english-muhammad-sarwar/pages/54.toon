quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,30,"On the day when every soul will see its good and bad deeds right before its very eyes, it will wish for the longest period of time to separate it from its bad deeds. God warns you about Himself. God is Compassionate to His servants"
  3,31,"(Muhammad), tell them, \"If you love God, follow me. God will love you and forgive your sins. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful"
  3,32,"Tell them, \"Obey God and the Messenger.\" If they turn away (let it be known) that God does not love the unbelievers"
  3,33,"God chose (and gave distinction to) Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham, and Imran over all the people of the world"
  3,34,They were the offspring of one another. God is All-hearing and All-seeing
  3,35,"Remember when Imran's wife prayed to her Lord saying, \"I have made a vow to dedicate to Your service whatever is in my womb. Lord, accept it from me. You are All-hearing and All-knowing"
  3,36,"When the baby was born she said, \"Lord, it is a female.\" God knew this. Male and female are not alike. \"I have named her Mary. I pray that You will keep her and her offspring safe from Satan, the condemned one"
  3,37,"Her Lord graciously accepted the offer and made Mary grow up, pure, and beautiful. Zachariah took custody of her. Whenever he went to visit her in her place of worship, he would find with her some food. He would ask her, \"Where did this food come from?\" She would reply, \"God has sent it.\" God gives sustenance to whomever He wants without keeping an account"
