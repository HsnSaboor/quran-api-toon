quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,in which no one will suffer forever
  92,16,except the wicked ones who have rejected the (Truth) and have turned away from it
  92,17,The pious ones who spend for the cause of God
  92,18,and purify themselves will be safe from this fire
  92,19,They do not expect any reward
  92,20,"except the pleasure of their Lord, the Most High"
  92,21,and the reward (of their Lord) will certainly make them happy
  93,1,By the midday brightness
  93,2,and by the calm of night
  93,3,"(Muhammad), your Lord has not abandoned you (by not sending you His revelation), nor is He displeased with you"
  93,4,The reward in the next life will certainly be better for you than worldly gains
  93,5,Your Lord will soon grant you sufficient favors to please you
  93,6,Did He not find you as an orphan and give you shelter
  93,7,Did He not find you wandering about and give you guidance
  93,8,And did He not find you in need and make you rich
  93,9,Do not oppress the orphans
  93,10,and do not reject the beggars
  93,11,and proclaim the bounties of your Lord
  94,1,"(Muhammad), have We not comforted your heart"
  94,2,relieved you of the burden
  94,3,which had been a heavy weight upon your back
  94,4,and granted you an exalted reputation
  94,5,After every difficulty there is relief
  94,6,"Certainly, after every difficulty there comes relief"
  94,7,"When you are free from (your obligations), strive hard (to worship God)"
  94,8,and be devoted to your Lord's service
