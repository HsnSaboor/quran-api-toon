quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,197,"The months of the hajj (pilgrimage) season are well known. Whoever undertakes to complete the hajj rituals, must know that, after commencing the acts of Hajj, he is not allowed to have carnal relations or to lie or to swear by the Name of God. God knows all your good deeds. Supply yourselves for the journey. The best supply is piety. People of understanding have fear of Me"
  2,198,"It is not a sin if you try to make a profit out of the bounty of your Lord (by trading during hajj). When you leave Arafah, commemorate the name of your Lord in Mash'ar, the sacred reminder of God. Commemorate His name as He has given you guidance while prior to that you had been in error"
  2,199,Then leave Mash'ar as the rest of the people do and ask forgiveness from God; He is All-forgiving and All-merciful
  2,200,"After you complete the acts of your Hajj, also commemorate God, just as you would remember your father, or even more earnestly. Some people say, \"Lord, give us what we want in this life,\" but in the life hereafter they have no beneficial share"
  2,201,"Others pray, \"Lord, give us good things both in this life as well as in the life hereafter and save us from the torment of fire"
  2,202,They will have their share of the reward for their deeds. God's reckoning is swift
