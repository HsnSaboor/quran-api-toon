quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,54,"(On the Day of Judgment) to redeem oneself of one's injustice, one would gladly spend the wealth of the whole earth if it were possible. On seeing the torment one will try to hide his regret. They will all be judged fairly and no wrong will be done to them"
  10,55,"All that is in the heavens and the earth certainly belongs to God and His promise is true, but many people do not know this"
  10,56,It is God who gives life and causes things to die. To Him you will all return
  10,57,"People, good advice has come to you from your Lord a (spiritual) cure, a guide and a mercy for the believers"
  10,58,"(Muhammad), tell them, \"To be happy with the favors and mercy of God is better than whatever you accumulate"
  10,59,"Ask them, \"Have you considered that out of the sustenance which God has given you, you made some of it lawful and some unlawful? Did God permit you to do this or are you ascribing falsehood to Him"
  10,60,"What do those who ascribe falsehood to God think of the Day of Judgment? God is generous to the human being, yet many do not give thanks"
  10,61,"(Muhammad), We bear witness to all your affairs; whatever you recite from the Quran and whatever you (people) do. Nothing in the heavens or the earth is hidden from your Lord, even that which is as small as an atom's weight or greater or smaller. All is recorded in the glorious Book"
