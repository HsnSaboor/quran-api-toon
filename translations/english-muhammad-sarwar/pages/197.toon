  9,65,"If you question them about their manners, they say, \"We were only arguing for the sake of amusement.\" Ask them, \"Were you mocking God, His revelations, and His Messenger"

  9,67,"Be they male or female hypocrites, they are the same. They make others commit sins, prevent them from doing good deeds, and restrain their hands (from spending for the cause of God). They have forgotten all about God who also has ignored them. The hypocrites indeed are evil-doers"
  9,68,"For the hypocrites and the unbelievers, God has prepared hell wherein they will live forever. Hell is their proper punishment. God has condemned them and they will suffer a permanent torment"
