quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,28,"Whatever they had concealed will be revealed to them. If they were to return to (the worldly life), they would again worship idols, for they are liars"
  6,29,They have said that this life is the only life and that there will be no Resurrection
  6,30,"Would that you could see them standing before their Lord who would ask them, \"Is not the Resurrection true?\" They would reply, \"Yes, Lord, there is a Resurrection.\" The Lord would then say, \"For your disbelief, suffer the torment"
  6,31,"Those who do not believe in the Day of Judgment have incurred upon themselves a great loss. When the Day of Judgment suddenly comes upon them, they will sink under the burden of their sins in grief for their neglecting that day. Terrible indeed will be their burden"
  6,32,The worldly life is but useless amusement and sport (compared to) the life hereafter which is far better and is only for the pious. Will you not then understand
  6,33,We certainly know that you (Muhammad) are sad about what they (the unbelievers) say. It is not you (alone) who has been accused of lying. The unjust have always rejected God's revelations
  6,34,"The Messengers who lived before you were also accused of lying, but they exercised patience. They were cruelly persecuted before We gave them victory. No one can change the words of God. You have already received news about the Messengers"
  6,35,"(Muhammad), if their refusal of the faith is so grievous to you and if you can dig up the earth or ascend into the sky in search of further evidence to inevitably make them believe you, you should have done so, but note that had God wanted, He could have made them all follow the same guidance. Do not ever be unaware (of this fact)"
