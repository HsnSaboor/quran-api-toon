quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the declining star
  53,2,your companion is not in error nor has he gone astray
  53,3,He does not speak out of his own desires
  53,4,It is a revelations which has been revealed to him
  53,5,and taught to him
  53,6,by the great mighty one (Gabriel)
  53,7,the strong one who appeared on the uppermost horizon
  53,8,He (Gabriel) then came nearer and nearer
  53,9,"until he was as close to him as the distance of two bows, or even less"
  53,10,He revealed to God's servant whatever he wanted
  53,11,His (Muhammad's) heart did not lie to him about what his eyes had seen
  53,12,Will you then argue with him about what he saw
  53,13,He certainly saw him (Gabriel) during his other ascent
  53,14,to the Lot-tree (in the seven heavens)
  53,15,near which is Paradise
  53,16,When the tree was covered with a covering
  53,17,"(Muhammad's) eyes did not deceive him, nor did they lead him to falsehood"
  53,18,He certainly saw the greatest (signs) of the existence of his Lord
  53,19,"(Can anything as such be considered true) of al-Lat, al-Uzza"
  53,20,and your third idol al-Manat (whom you considered as God's daughters)
  53,21,Do sons belong to you and daughters to God
  53,22,This is an unfair distinction
  53,23,"These are only names given by yourselves and your fathers. God has not given them any authority. They, (unbelievers), only follow mere conjecture and the desires of their souls, even though guidance has already come to them from their Lord"
  53,24,Can the human being have whatever he wishes
  53,25,All that is in the life to come and all that is in this life belongs only to God
  53,26,There are many angels in the heavens whose intercession will be of no benefit unless God grants such permission to whichever of them He wants
