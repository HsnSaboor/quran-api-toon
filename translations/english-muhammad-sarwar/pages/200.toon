quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,80,"(Muhammad), whether you ask God to forgive them or not, He will never do so, even if you were to beg seventy times; they have disbelieved in God and His Messenger and God does not guide the evil-doers"
  9,81,"Those who did not take part in the battle (of Tabuk), were glad about their staying home against the order of the Messenger of God. They did not want to fight for the cause of God with their property and in person and said, \"Do not march (to the battle) on the hot days.\" (Muhammad), tell them, \"The heat of hell fire is much more severe, if only you would understand"
  9,82,They should laugh less and weep more as a recompense for what they have gained
  9,83,"When God brings you back safely and a group of hypocrites ask you to make them exempt from taking part in the battle, tell them, \"Never march with me and never fight with us against any of the enemies (of God). You chose to linger behind the first time, so this time stay behind with those who are of no help in the battle"
  9,84,"Should any of them die, never pray for him or stand on his grave. They have disbelieved in God and His Messenger and have died while committing evil"
  9,85,Their wealth or children should not tempt you; God wants to punish them through these things in this life so that they will die as disbelievers
  9,86,"When a chapter of the Quran is revealed telling them to believe in God and fight along with His Messenger for His cause against His enemies, the healthy and rich ones of them ask you to exempt them from taking part in the battle for the cause of God and to let them stay home with the people who are of no help in the battle"
