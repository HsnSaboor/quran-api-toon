quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"(Muhammad), ask them, \"What is the greatest testimony? God testifies of my truthfulness to you. He has revealed this Quran to me to warn you and the coming generations (against disobeying God). Do you believe that other gods exist besides God? I solemnly declare that He is the only Lord and that I am not guilty of believing in what the pagans believe"
  6,20,"The People of the Book know him (Muhammad) just as well as they know their own children, but those who have lost their souls will not believe"
  6,21,Who are more unjust than those who ascribe falsehood to God or reject His revelations? The unjust will certainly have no happiness
  6,22,"On the Day of Judgment when We will gather all people together, We will ask the pagans, \"Where are those whom you believed to be your gods"
  6,23,"Attempting to answer, they will say, \"Lord, we swear by Your Name that we were not pagans"
  6,24,"Consider, how they have lied against their own souls and have lost their gods"
  6,25,"Some of them listen to you, but We have veiled their hearts so that they cannot understand and made them deaf. They disbelieve all the evidence (of Our existence) that they may have seen. They only come to you for the sake of argument and the disbelievers say that (whatever Muhammad says) is no more than ancient legends"
  6,26,"They keep away from the faith and forbid others to accept it. They destroy no one except themselves, yet they do not realize it"
  6,27,"If only you could see them standing in the fire saying, \"Would that we could return to the worldly life. We would never reject any of our Lord's revelations and we would be true believers"
