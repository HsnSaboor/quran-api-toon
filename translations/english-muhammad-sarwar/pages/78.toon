quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,7,"Male and female are entitled to their legal share in the legacy of their parents and relatives, whether it be small or large"
  4,8,"If relatives, orphans or destitute people, are present at the distribution of the legacy, give them something and speak kindly to them"
  4,9,"Those who are concerned about the welfare of their own children after their death, should have fear of God (when dealing with the orphans) and guide them properly"
  4,10,"Those who wrongfully consume the property of orphans are, in fact, consuming fire in their bellies and they will suffer the blazing fire"
  4,11,"This is a commandment from your Lord: After the payment of debts or anything bequeathed, let the male inherit twice as much as the female. If there are more than two girls, they will have two-thirds of the legacy. If there is only one girl, she will inherit half of the legacy. Parents of the deceased will each inherit one-sixth of the legacy, if the deceased has a surviving child, however, if no children survive the deceased, and the heirs are the parents, the mother will receive one-third of the legacy. The mother will receive one-sixth of the legacy if the deceased has more than one surviving brother. These are the decreed shares according to the laws of God. Regardless of how you feel about your parents or children, you do not know which of them is more beneficial to you. God is All-knowing and All-wise"
