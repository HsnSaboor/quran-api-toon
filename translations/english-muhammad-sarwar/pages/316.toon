quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  20,65,"They said, \"Moses, would you be the first to show your skill or should we be the first to throw down our devices"
  20,66,"Moses said, \"You throw first.\" When they did, their ropes and staffs through their magic seemed to be moving"
  20,67,Moses felt afraid within himself
  20,68,"We told him, \"Do not be afraid for you will be the winner"
  20,69,Throw down what is in your right hand and it will swallow up all that they have performed; theirs is only a magical performance. Magicians can find no happiness in whatever they do
  20,70,"The magicians bowed down in prostration saying, \"We believe in the Lord of Moses and Aaron"
  20,71,"The Pharaoh said, \"Since you believed in him without my permission, then Moses certainly must be your chief who has taught you magic. I shall cut your hands and feet on alternate sides and crucify you on the trunk of the palm-tree. You shall certainly find which among us can afflict a more severe and lasting punishment"
  20,72,"They (the magicians) said, \"We would never prefer you to the miracles that we have seen or to our Creator. Do what you want. This life is only for a short time"
  20,73,We have faith in our Lord so that He will forgive our sins and our magical performances that you forced us to show. God is better than all things and His rewards last longer
  20,74,The dwelling place of one who comes into the presence of his Lord as a criminal will be hell wherein he will never die nor enjoy his life
  20,75,One who comes into the presence of his Lord with faith and righteous deeds
  20,76,will be rewarded by high status in the gardens of Eden wherein streams flow. Such will be the reward of those who purify themselves
