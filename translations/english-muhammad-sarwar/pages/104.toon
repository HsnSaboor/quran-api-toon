  4,165,"The Messengers were sent to give people the glad news (of God's mercy) and warn them (of His punishment) so that the human being would not have any objections against God, after the coming of the Messengers, (that they did not have any knowledge of His mercy and punishment). God is Majestic and All-wise"
