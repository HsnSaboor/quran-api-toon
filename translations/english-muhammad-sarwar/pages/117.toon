quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,51,"Believers, do not consider the Jews and Christians as your intimate friends for they are only friends with each other. Whoever does so will be considered as one of them. God does not guide the unjust people"
  5,52,"(Muhammad), you have seen those whose hearts are sick, running around among the people (Jews) saying, \"We are afraid of being struck by disaster.\" But if God were to grant you victory or some other favors, they would then regret for what they had been hiding in their souls"
  5,53,"The believers say, \"Are these the people who proclaimed themselves to be our sworn friends?\" Their deeds have become devoid of all virtue and they themselves have become lost"
  5,54,"Believers, whichever of you turns away from his faith should know that God will soon raise a people whom He loves and who love Him, who are humble towards the believers, dignified to the unbelievers, who strive hard for the cause of God, and who have no fear of anyone's accusations. This is a favor from God. He bestows His favors upon whomever He wants. God is Munificent and All-knowing"
  5,55,"Only God, His Messenger, and the true believers who are steadfast in prayer and pay alms, while they kneel during prayer, are your guardians"
  5,56,"One whose guardians are God, His Messenger, and the true believers should know that God's party will certainly triumph"
  5,57,"Believers, do not consider those among the People of the Book and the unbelievers who mock at your religion and treat it as useless, as your protectors. Have fear of God if you are true believers"
