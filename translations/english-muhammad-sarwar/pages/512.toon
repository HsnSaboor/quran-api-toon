quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  48,10,"Those who pledge obedience to you are, in fact, pledging obedience to God. The hands of God are above their hands. As for those who disregard their pledge, they do so only against their own souls. Those who fulfill their promise to God will receive a great reward"
  48,11,"The bedouins who lag behind in taking part in the battle say to you, \"Ask forgiveness for us; we were busy with our property and household.\" They speak what is not in their hearts. (Muhammad), tell them, \"Who will help you against God, if He intends to harm you, who will prevent Him from benefitting you? In fact, God is Well Aware of whatever you do"
  48,12,You thought the Messenger and the believers would never ever return to their families and this attracted your hearts and caused you to develop evil suspicions. You are a wrong doing people
  48,13,Those who do not believe in God and His Messenger should know that We have prepared hell for the disbelievers
  48,14,To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He forgives or punishes whomever He wants. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful
  48,15,"The laggardly Bedouins will say, \"When you leave to collect the spoils, let us follow you.\" They want to alter the command of God (that only the participating believers are entitled to such benefit). Tell them, \"You can never follow us for such a purpose. God has said before and He will say again (what type of people you are). In fact, you are jealous of us.\" The truth is that they understand very little"
