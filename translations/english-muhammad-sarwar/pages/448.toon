quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,Do you believe in the Day of Judgment
  37,53,Shall we be recompensed for our deeds after we die and become bones and dust
  37,54,Do you want to see him
  37,55,He will look down and see him in hell
  37,56,"He will say to his friend in hell, \"By God, you almost destroyed me"
  37,57,"Had I not the guidance of my Lord, I would certainly have been brought into torment"
  37,58,"He will ask his companion, \"Did you not say that there would only be one death"
  37,59,and that we would not be punished
  37,60,This is certainly the greatest triumph
  37,61,for which one must strive hard
  37,62,Is this not a better reward than the tree of Zaqqum
  37,63,which We have made as a torment for the unjust
  37,64,(Zaqqum) is a tree which grows from the deepest part of hell
  37,65,and its fruits are like the heads of devils
  37,66,The dwellers of hell will eat that fruit and fill-up their bellies
  37,67,Then they will have on top of it a mixture of boiling water
  37,68,They can only return to hell
  37,69,They found their father going astray
  37,70,and rushed to follow them
  37,71,Most of the ancient people had also gone astray
  37,72,We had certainly sent warners to them
  37,73,See how terrible was the end of those who were warned
  37,74,Only Our sincere servants were saved
  37,75,Noah called for help. How blessed was the answer which he received
  37,76,We rescued him and his people from the greatest affliction
