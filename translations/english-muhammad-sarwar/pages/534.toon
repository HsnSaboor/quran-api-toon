  56,6,they will become like dust scattered around
  56,7,"On that day, you (mankind) will be divided into three groups"
  56,8,The people of the right hand - those whose books of records will be placed in their right hands. How happy they will be
  56,9,The people of the left hand - those whose books of records will be placed in their left hands. How miserable they will be
  56,10,The foremost ones (in faith and virtue) - the foremost ones in receiving their reward
  56,11,(The foremost ones) will be the nearest ones to God
  56,12,in the beautiful Paradise
  56,13,Many of them will be from the ancient people
  56,14,and only a few of them from the later generations
  56,15,They will recline on jewelled couches
  56,16,facing one another
