quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  21,11,How many unjust towns did We destroy and replace them with other nations
  21,12,When they found Our torment approaching them they started to run away from the town
  21,13,"We told them, \"Do not run away. Come back to your luxuries and your houses so that you can be questioned"
  21,14,"They said, \"Woe to us! We have been unjust"
  21,15,Such was what they continued to say until We mowed them down and made them completely extinct
  21,16,We did not create the heavens and the earth just for fun
  21,17,"Had We wanted to play games, We could have certainly done so with things at hand"
  21,18,We bring forward the Truth to crush and destroy falsehood; it is doomed to be banished. Woe to you for your way of thinking about God
  21,19,"To Him belongs all those who are in the heavens and the earth. Those who are closer to Him are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they get tired of worshipping"
  21,20,They glorify Him day and night without fail
  21,21,Have they chosen deities from earth? Can such deities give life to anyone
  21,22,"Had there been other deities in the heavens and the earth besides God, both the heavens and the earth would have been destroyed. God, the Lord of the Throne, is too Glorious to be as they think He is"
  21,23,"He will not be questioned about anything He does, but all people will be questioned about their deeds"
  21,24,"Have they chosen other gods besides God? (Muhammad), ask them, \"Show the proof (in support of such belief). This is (the Quran) which tells us about the (beliefs of the people) in my time and those who lived before me.\" Most of them do not know. Moreover, the truth is that they neglect (the question of belief altogether)"
