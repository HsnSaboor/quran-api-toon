quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,31,"As the upright servants of God, do not consider anything equal to God. To consider things equal to God is like one falling from the sky who is snatched away by the birds or carried away by a strong wind to a far distant place"
  22,32,To respect the symbols of God is the sign of a pious heart
  22,33,There are benefits for you in the (sacrificial offerings) of God until the appointed time when you slaughter them as your offering near the Ancient House
  22,34,"To every nation We have given certain sacrificial rituals. Let them consecrate their sacrificial animals with His Name. Your God is One God and you must submit yourselves to His will. (Muhammad), give the glad news (of God's mercy) to the devoted servants of God"
  22,35,"Those whose hearts are filled with awe on hearing about God, who exercise patience in hardships, who are steadfast in prayer, and who spend their property for the cause of God"
  22,36,"For you We have made the sacrificial camel one of the reminders of God. It also has other benefits for you. Consecrate it with the Name of God when it is steadily standing. When it is slaughtered, consume its flesh and give part of it to the needy who do and those do not ask for help from others. Thus We have made the camel subservient to you so that perhaps you may give thanks"
  22,37,"It is not the flesh and blood of your sacrifice that pleases God. What pleases God is your piety. God has made subservient to you the sacrificial animals so that perhaps you will glorify Him; He is guiding you. (Muhammad), give the glad news (of God's mercy) to the righteous people"
  22,38,"God defends the believers but He does not love any of the treacherous, ungrateful ones"
