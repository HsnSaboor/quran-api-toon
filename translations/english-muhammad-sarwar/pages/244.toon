  12,70,"When he had furnished them with provisions, he placed the King's drinking cup in his own brother's baggage. Then someone shouted, \"People of the caravan, you are thieves"
  12,71,"Joseph's brothers turned around and asked, \"What is missing"
  12,72,"They were told, \"The King's drinking cup is missing and whoever brings it will receive a camel's load of grain. I promise you that"
  12,73,"Joseph's brothers said, \"We swear by God, as you know, that we have not come to spread evil in the land and that we have not committed any theft"
  12,74,"The Egyptians said, \"What do you suggest should be the punishment for the thief, if it is proved that you are lying"
  12,75,"Joseph's brothers replied, \"In whosoever baggage it is found, that person will be your bondsman. Thus is the punishment of the unjust"
  12,76,"They searched their baggage before that of Joseph's real brother where at last they found it. Thus, We showed Joseph how to plan this; he would not have been able to take his brother under the King's law unless God had wanted it to be so. We give a high rank to whomever We want. Over every knowledgeable person is one more knowing"
  12,77,"(Joseph's) brothers said, \"It's no wonder that he steals; a brother of his had stolen before him.\" Joseph noted their remarks, but did not utter a word. He said (to himself), \"You are in a worse position. God knows best what you allege"
  12,78,"They said, \"Noble Prince, his father is very old so please take one of us in his place. We believe that you are a righteous person"
