quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  62,1,"All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify God, the King, the Holy, the Majestic and the All-wise"
  62,2,It is He who has sent to the illiterate a Messenger from among their own people to recite to them His revelations and purify them. He will teach the Book to them
  62,3,"and others who have not yet joined, and He will give them wisdom. Before this they had been in plain error. God is Majestic and All-wise"
  62,4,Such is the favor of God which He grants to whomever He wants. God's favor is great
  62,5,"Those who were to carry the responsibility of the Torah but ignored, are like donkeys laden with books. How terrible is the example of the people who reject the revelations of God. God does not guide the unjust"
  62,6,"(Muhammad), ask the Jews, \"If you believe that you are the chosen people of God to the exclusion of all other people, wish for death if you are truthful"
  62,7,They will never wish for death because of what they have done! God knows best about the unjust people
  62,8,"(Muhammad), tell them, \"The death from which you run away will certainly approach you. Then you will be returned to the One who knows the unseen and the seen, and He will tell you what you have done"
