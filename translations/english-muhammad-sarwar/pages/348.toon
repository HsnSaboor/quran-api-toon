quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,90,"We have sent them the truth and they, certainly, are liars"
  23,91,"God has never given birth to a son and there is no other god besides Him. If there were, each god would have taken away his creatures and claimed superiority over the others. God is too exalted to be as they believe Him to be"
  23,92,He has the knowledge of all seen and unseen things. He is too exalted to be considered equal to anything else
  23,93,"Say, \"Lord, if you will afflict them with punishment"
  23,94,exclude me from the unjust people
  23,95,We have the Power to strike them with torment before your very eyes
  23,96,Respond to the injustice (done to you) with the better deed. We know best what they attribute to God
  23,97,"Say, \"Lord, I seek your protection against the strong temptations of the devils"
  23,98,I seek your protection should they approach me
  23,99,"When death approaches one of the unbelievers, he says, \"Lord, send me back again"
  23,100,"so that perhaps I shall act righteously for the rest of my life.\" Although he will say so but his wish will never come true. After death they will be behind a barrier until the day of their resurrection"
  23,101,There will be no kindred relations nor any opportunity to ask about others or seek their assistance after the trumpet has sounded
  23,102,"If the side of ones good deeds weighs heavier on a scale, he will have everlasting happiness"
  23,103,"but if it weighs less, one will be lost forever in hell"
  23,104,The fire will scorch their faces and they will be groaning therein in pain
