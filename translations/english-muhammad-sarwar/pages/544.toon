quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  58,12,"Believers, whenever you consult the Prophet, offer charity before your consultation. This will be better for you and more pure. However, if you do not find anything to give in charity, then God is All-forgiving and All-merciful"
  58,13,"Were you afraid that giving in charity before your consultation would make you poor? Since you did not offer such charity, God forgave you for this. At least be steadfast in prayer, pay the religious tax, and obey God and His Messenger. God is Well Aware of what you do"
  58,14,"Have you not seen those who have established friendship with the people who are subject to the wrath of God? They do not belong to you nor you to them, yet they knowingly try to prove their point by using false oaths"
  58,15,God has prepared a severe torment for them. What an evil deed they have committed
  58,16,They have made their oaths as a shield to obstruct others from the way of God. They will suffer a humiliating torment
  58,17,Neither their wealth nor their children will be able to protect them against God. They will be the dwellers of hell fire wherein they will live forever
  58,18,"On the day when God will resurrect them all together, they will swear to Him as they swore to you and they will think that they have a good case but they are certainly liars"
  58,19,Satan has dominated them and has made them forget the guidance of God. They are Satan's party and the party of Satan will certainly suffer a great loss
  58,20,Disgrace will strike those who oppose God and His Messenger
  58,21,"God has decreed, \"I and My Messenger shall certainly triumph.\" God is All-powerful and Majestic"
