quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,1,This is a chapter which We have revealed to you and made obligatory for you to follow its guidance. We have revealed clear verses in it so that perhaps you may take heed
  24,2,"Flog the fornicatress and the fornicator with a hundred lashes each. Let there be no reluctance in enforcing the laws of God, if you have faith in God and the Day of Judgment. Let it take place in the presence of a group of believers"
  24,3,No one should marry a fornicator except a fornicatress or a pagan woman. No one should marry a fornicatress except a fornicator or a pagan man. Such (marriage) is unlawful to the believers
  24,4,Those who accuse married women of committing adultery - but are not able to prove their accusation by producing four witness - must be flogged eighty lashes. Never accept their testimony thereafter because they are sinful
  24,5,except that of those who afterwards repent and reform themselves; God is All-forgiving and All-merciful
  24,6,"Those who accuse their spouses of committing adultery but have no witness except themselves, should testify four times saying, \"God is my witness that I am telling the truth"
  24,7,"They should say on the fifth time, \"Let God's curse be upon me if I am a liar"
  24,8,"The spouse will be acquitted of the punishment if she challenges his testimony by saying four times, \"God is my witness that he is a liar"
  24,9,"On the fifth time she should say, \"Let the curse of God be upon me if what he says is true"
  24,10,Had it not been for God's favors and mercy upon you (your life would have been in chaos). God accepts repentance and He is All-wise
