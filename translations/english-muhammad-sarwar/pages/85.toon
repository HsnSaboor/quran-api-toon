quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,38,"those who spend their property out of a desire to show off and not because of their belief in God and the Day of Judgment, and (lastly) those who choose Satan for a friend; what an evil friend"
  4,39,How could it have harmed them if they had believed in God and the Last Day and spent their property for the cause of God? God knows them very well
  4,40,God does not do even an atom's weight of injustice. A good deed is multiplied by God and richly rewarded
  4,41,"How will it be when We call for a witness from every nation and have you, (Muhammad), testify against them all"
  4,42,At that time the disbelievers who disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they could be turned into dust and they will be able to hide nothing from God
  4,43,"Believers, do not pray when you are drunk, but, instead, wait until you can understand what you say. Also, do not pray when you have experienced a seminal discharge until after you have taken a bath, unless you are on a journey. If, while sick or on a journey, you can find no water after having defecated or after having had carnal relations, perform tayammum by touching your palms on the pure earth and wipe the (upper part of) your face and the backs of your hands. God is Gracious and All-forgiving"
  4,44,"Have you seen those who had received a portion of the Book trade misguidance and try to make you, too, go astray"
