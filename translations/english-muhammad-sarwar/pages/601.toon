quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By the time (of the advent of Islam)
  103,2,the human being is doomed to suffer loss
  103,3,except the righteously striving believers who exhort each other to truthful purposes and to patience
  104,1,Woe to every slanderer and backbiter
  104,2,who collects and hordes wealth
  104,3,thinking that his property will make him live forever
  104,4,By no means! They will be thrown into hutamah
  104,5,Would that you knew what hutamah is
  104,6,It is a fierce fire created by God
  104,7,to penetrate into the hearts
  104,8,It will engulf them
  104,9,in its long columns of flames
  105,1,Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the people of the elephant
  105,2,Did He not cause their evil plots to fail
  105,3,by sending against them flocks of swallows
  105,4,which showered them with small pebbles of clay
  105,5,to turn them into (something) like the left-over grass grazed by cattle
