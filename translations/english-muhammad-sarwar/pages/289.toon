quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  17,67,"If you are afflicted by hardships in the middle of the sea, it would be an error to call anyone other than Him for help. When God saves you from such difficulties, you turn away from Him. The human being has always been ungrateful"
  17,68,Do you feel secure that We will not cause a part of the land to sink or engulf you with sand storms when you would find no one to protect you
  17,69,"Do you feel secure that We will not drive you back to the sea, send a fierce gale to you, and cause you to drown because of your disbelief when you would not be able to find anyone who would intercede for you with Us"
  17,70,"We have honored the children of Adam, carried them on the land and the sea, given them pure sustenance and exalted them above most of My creatures"
  17,71,"On the day when We call every nation with their leaders, those whose record of deeds are given to their right hands will read the book and the least wrong will not be done to them"
  17,72,Those who are blind in this life will also be blind in the life to come and in terrible error
  17,73,(Such blind ones) try to confuse what We have revealed to you so that they may falsely ascribe to Us something other than the true revelation and thus establish friendship with you
  17,74,Had We not strengthened your faith you might have relied on them some how
  17,75,"Had you done so, We would certainly have made you face double punishment in this life and after your death and you would have found none to help you"
