quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  38,62,But why is it that we cannot see men whom we had considered as wicked
  38,63,and whom we mocked? Have they been rescued or can our eyes not find them
  38,64,Such disputes will certainly take place among the dwellers of hell fire
  38,65,"(Muhammad) say, \"I am only a warner. The only Lord is God, the Almighty"
  38,66,"He is the Lord of the heavens, the earth, and all that is between them, the Majestic and All-forgiving"
  38,67,"Say, \"It (facts about the supremacy of God) is the greatest message"
  38,68,but you have turned away from it
  38,69,I have no knowledge of the dispute among the angels (concerning their attitude towards Adam)
  38,70,I have only received revelation to give you plain warning
  38,71,"When your Lord told the angels, \"I will create a mortal out of clay"
  38,72,"and when I give it proper shape and blow My spirit into it, bow down in prostration to him"
  38,73,all the angel then prostrated themselves
  38,74,except Iblis who puffed himself up with pride and became a disbeliever
  38,75,"The Lord said, \"Iblis, what prevented you from prostrating before what I have created with My own hands? Was it because of your pride or are you truly exalted"
  38,76,"He said, \"I am better than him. You have created me from fire and him out of clay"
  38,77,"The Lord said, \"Get out of here. You deserve to be stoned"
  38,78,My condemnation will be with you until the Day of Judgment
  38,79,"He said, \"Lord, grant me respite until the Day of Resurrection"
  38,80,"The Lord said, \"You will only be given a respite"
  38,81,for an appointed time
  38,82,"He said, \"By Your Glory, I shall seduce all of them (children of Adam)"
  38,83,except Your sincere servants among them
