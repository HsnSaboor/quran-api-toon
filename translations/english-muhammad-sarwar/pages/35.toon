quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,220,"about this life and the life hereafter. They ask you about the orphans. Tell them, \"The best thing to do is what is for their good. They are your brethren if you would associate with them. God knows who is corrupt or a reformer. Had God wanted He would have brought upon you hardship. God is Majestic and All-wise"
  2,221,"Do not marry pagan women unless they believe in God. A believing slave girl is better than an idolater, even though the idolaters may attract you. Do not marry pagan men unless they believe in God. A believing slave is better than an idolater, even though the idolater may attract you. The pagans invite you to the fire, but God invites you to Paradise and forgiveness through His will. God shows His evidence to people so that they may take heed"
  2,222,"They ask you about women's menses. Tell them, \"It is an ailment. Avoid having carnal relations with them until their period is over.\" Then you may have carnal relations with them according to the rules of God. God loves those who repent and those who purify themselves"
  2,223,Your wives are as fields for you. You may enter your fields from any place you want. Reserve something good for your souls (for the life hereafter). Have fear of God and know that you are going to meet Him. (Muhammad) give the glad news to the believers
  2,224,"Do not swear by God not to do good things, or have piety, or make peace among people. God is All-hearing and All-knowing"
