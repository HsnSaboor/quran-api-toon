quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"(The hypocrites) wait and watch. If God grants you victory, they say, \"Did we not help you?\" If the unbelievers are victorious, they say, \"Did we not encourage you not to surrender to the believers and did we not protect you from them?\" God will judge among you on the Day of Judgment. He will never help the disbelievers against the believers"
  4,142,"The hypocrites try to deceive God but He, in fact, deceives them. They stand up in prayer lazily just to show that they pray, but, in truth they remember God very little"
  4,143,They are hesitant people belonging to neither side. You can find no other way for one whom God has caused to go astray
  4,144,"Believers, do not make unbelievers your intimate friends and supporters rather than believers. Do you want to establish clear evidence against yourselves before God"
  4,145,"The hypocrites will be placed in the lowest bottom of the fire and none of you will ever find a helper for them, except"
  4,146,"those (hypocrites) who have repented, put their trust in God, and sincerely followed only His religion will live with the believers to whom God will give a great reward"
  4,147,Why should God punish you if you give thanks and believe in Him? God is All-rewarding and All-forgiving
