quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  36,28,We did not send an army against his people from the heaven after his death nor did We need to send one
  36,29,It was only a single blast which made them extinct
  36,30,"Woe to human beings! Whenever a Messenger came to them, they mocked him"
  36,31,"Have they not seen how many generations, living before them, had We destroyed and they cannot ever come back to them"
  36,32,They will all be brought into Our presence together
  36,33,Evidence (of the truth) for them is how We revived the dead earth
  36,34,and produced therein grains from which they eat and established therein gardens of palms trees and vineyards and have made streams flow therein
  36,35,so that they may consume the fruits and whatever their hands prepare. Will they not then be grateful
  36,36,"All glory belongs to the One Who has created pairs out of what grow from the earth, out of their soul and out of that which they do not know"
  36,37,Of the signs for them is how We separated the day from the night and thus they remained in darkness
  36,38,how the sun moves in its orbit and this is the decree of the Majestic and All-knowing God
  36,39,how We ordained the moon to pass through certain phases until it seems eventually to be like a bent twig
  36,40,"how the sun is not supposed to catch-up with the moon, nor is the night to precede the day. All of them are to float in a certain orbit"
