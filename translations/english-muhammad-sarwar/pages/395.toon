quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,78,"He said, \"I have received this wealth because of my knowledge.\" Did he not know that God had destroyed many generations that lived before him who were stronger than him in power and people? (There will be no need) to ask the criminals what sins they have committed, (for the angels already know them)"
  28,79,"Korah would bedeck himself to show off his wealth. Those who wanted worldly gains would say, \"Would that we were given that which Korah has received. He has certainly received a great share"
  28,80,"The people who had received knowledge would tell them, \"Woe to you! The reward of God is far better for the righteously striving believers. No one can receive such reward except those who exercise patience"
  28,81,We caused the earth to swallow up him and his home. No one besides God could help him nor could he himself achieve victory
  28,82,"The people who the other day had wished to be like him, began saying, \"Woe to us! God gives abundant wealth only to those of His servants whom He wants and He determines everyone's share. Had it not been for God's favor to us, He would have caused the earth to swallow us up. Woe to the unbelievers who will have no happiness"
  28,83,There is the life hereafter which We have prepared for those who do not want to impose their superiority over the others in the land nor commit evil therein. The happy end certainly belongs to the pious ones
  28,84,The reward for a good deed will be greater than the deed itself and the recompense for an evil deed will be equivalent to the deed
