  34,40,"On the day when God will rise them all together and ask the angels, \"Had these people been worshipping you"
  34,41,"They will reply, \"All glory belongs to you. You are our guardian, not they. They had been worshipping the jinn and most of them had strong faith"
  34,42,"None of them can help or harm each other on this day. We shall tell the unjust ones, \"Suffer the torment of the fire which you had called a lie"
  34,43,"When Our illustrious revelations are recited to them, they say, \"This man only wants to prevent you from worshipping what your father's had worshipped.\" They say \"This, (the Quran), is a mere invented lie.\" The unbelievers have said about the truth when it came to them, \"This only is plain magic"

  34,45,"These people have not one tenth of power or wealth that we had given to those who lived before them. They called Our Messengers liars. Thus, how terrible was My vengeance"
  34,46,"Say, \"I advise you to believe only in One God and worship Him individually or two people together.\" Think carefully; your companion is not possessed by jinn. He is only warning you of the coming severe torment"
  34,47,"Say, \"Whatever reward I ask you (for my preaching) will be for your own good. No one can reward me except God. He is the Witness over all things"
  34,48,"Say, \"My Lord speaks the Truth. He has the knowledge of the unseen"
