quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  20,38,Remember when We inspired your mother with a certain inspiration
  20,39,to lace her child in a chest and throw it into the sea which would hurl it towards the shore. Then an enemy of Mine who was also the enemy of the child would pick it up from there. I made you attractive and loveable so that you would be reared before My own eyes
  20,40,"Your sister went to them and said, \"May I show you someone who will nurse this child?\" We returned you to your mother to make her rejoice and forget her grief. You slew a man and We saved you from trouble. We tried you through various trials. Then you stayed some years with the people of Midian (Shu'ayb and his family) and after that you came back to Egypt as was ordained"
  20,41,I chose you for Myself
  20,42,Go with your brother. Take My miracles and do not be reluctant in preaching My message
  20,43,Go both of you to the Pharaoh; he has become a rebel
  20,44,Both of you must speak with him in a gentle manner so that perhaps he may come to himself or have fear (of God)
  20,45,"They said, \"Lord, we are afraid of his transgression and rebellion against us"
  20,46,"The Lord replied them, \"Do not be afraid; I Am with you all the time, listening and seeing"
  20,47,"They came to the Pharaoh and told him that they were the Messengerss of his Lord and that they wanted him to let the Israelites go with them and stop afflicting the Israelites with torment. They told the Pharaoh, \"We have brought miracles from Our Creator. Peace be with those who follow the right guidance"
  20,48,It is revealed to us that those who call our message a lie or turn away from it will face the torment
  20,49,"The Pharaoh asked them, \"Who is your Lord"
  20,50,"They replied, \"Our Lord is the One Who has created all things and has given guidance"
  20,51,"He then asked, \"What do you know about the past generations"
