quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  35,19,The blind and the seeing are not alike
  35,20,nor are darkness and light
  35,21,nor shade and heat
  35,22,"nor are the living and the dead. God makes to listen whomever He wants. (Muhammad), you cannot make people in the graves to listen"
  35,23,You are simply a warner
  35,24,We have sent you in all truth as a bearer of glad news and a warner. No nation who lived before was left without a warner
  35,25,"If they reject you, (know that) others who lived before them had also rejected their Messengers, Messengers who had brought them miracles, scriptures, and the enlightening Book"
  35,26,so I seized the unbelievers and how terrible was their torment
  35,27,"Have you not seen that God has sent water down from the sky, has produced fruits of various colors, and has made streaks of various colors in the mountains, white, red, and intense black"
  35,28,"He has also created people, beasts, and cattle of various colors. Only God's knowledgeable servants fear Him. God is Majestic and All-pardoning"
  35,29,"Those who recite the Book of God, who are steadfast in prayer and, who spend out of what We have given them for the cause of God, both in public and in private, have hope in an indestructible bargain"
  35,30,and in receiving their reward from God and in further favors. He is All-forgiving and All-appreciating
