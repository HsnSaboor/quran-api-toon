quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,78,"We have told you the stories of some of Our Messengers whom We had sent before you and We have not told you the stories of some others. A Messenger is not supposed to show a miracle without the permission of God. When God's decree of punishment comes to pass, He will judge truthfully and the supporters of the falsehood will perish when God's decree of punishemnt comes to pass"
  40,79,It is God Who has created cattle for you to ride and to consume as food
  40,80,You may also obtain other benefits from them. You may ride them to seek whatever you need or be carried by them as ships carry you by sea
  40,81,God shows you the evidence (of His existence). How can you then deny such evidence
  40,82,Have they not travelled through the land to see the terrible end of those who lived before them? They were far mightier in both number and power and in what they had established. Their (worldly) gains were of no benefit to them
  40,83,They were far too content with their own knowledge (to pay attention to the Messengers) when Our Messengers came to them with illustrious evidence. They were encompassed by the torment for mocking Our guidance
  40,84,"They said, \"We believe in One God and disbelieve in whatever we had considered equal to Him,\" when they experienced Our wrath"
  40,85,Their faith proved to be of no benefit to them when they became subject to Our torment. Such was God's prevailing tradition among His servants in the past. Thus were the unbelievers destroyed
