quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  52,32,Does their reason tell them to say this or is it because they are a rebellious people
  52,33,"Do they say, \"He has falsely invented it (the Quran)?\" In fact, they themselves have no faith"
  52,34,Let them produce a discourse like it if they are true in their claim
  52,35,Have they been created from nothing or are they themselves their own creators
  52,36,"Have they created the heavens and the earth? In fact, they have no strong faith"
  52,37,Do they own the treasures of your Lord? Have they any authority over God
  52,38,Do they have a ladder (by which they can climb up to the heavens) and listen (to the angels) and come back to the rest of the people with clear authority
  52,39,Do the daughters belong to Him and the sons to you
  52,40,Do you (Muhammad) ask them for any payment (for your preaching) which they cannot afford
  52,41,"Do they have knowledge of the unseen, thus, are able to predict (the future)"
  52,42,Do they design evil plans? The disbelievers themselves will be snared by their evil plots
  52,43,Do they have another god besides God? God is too exalted to be considered equal to the idols
  52,44,"Even if they were to see a part of the heavens falling down upon them, they would say, \"It is only dense cloud"
  52,45,So leave them alone until they face the day when they will be struck dead from terror
  52,46,and when their evil plans will be of no benefit to them nor will they be helped
  52,47,The unjust will suffer other torments besides this but most of them do not know
  52,48,Wait patiently for the command of your Lord. We are watching over you. Glorify your Lord when you rise during the night
  52,49,and glorify Him after the setting of the stars
