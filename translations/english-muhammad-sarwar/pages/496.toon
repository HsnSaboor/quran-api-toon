quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  44,1,Ha. Mim
  44,2,I swear by the illustrious Book
  44,3,that We have revealed the Quran on a blessed night to warn mankind
  44,4,"On this night, every absolute command coming from Us becomes distinguishable"
  44,5,The command that We have been sending
  44,6,as a mercy (for the human being) from your Lord. Your Lord is All-hearing and All-knowing
  44,7,"He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if only you would have strong faith"
  44,8,There is only One Lord. It is He who gives life and causes things to die. He is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers
  44,9,"In fact, the unbelievers have doubts because of excessive involvement in worldly affairs"
  44,10,Wait for the day (which will come before the Day of Judgment) when the sky will give out dense smoke
  44,11,"which will smother the people. They will say, \"This is a painful torment"
  44,12,"Lord, remove this torment from us for we are believers"
  44,13,How could this punishment bring them to their senses when a Messenger evidently had come to them
  44,14,"and they turned away, saying, \"He is a trained and insane person"
  44,15,We shall remove the torment for a while but you will revert to your old ways
  44,16,"However, We shall truly take Our revenge on the day when the great seizure takes place"
  44,17,"We had certainly tested the people of the Pharaoh before them to whom a noble Messengers had come, saying"
  44,18,Send the servants of God with me. I am a trustworthy Messenger sent to you
