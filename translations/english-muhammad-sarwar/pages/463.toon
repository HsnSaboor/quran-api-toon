quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  39,41,"(Muhammad), We have revealed the Book to you for mankind in all truth. Whoever seeks guidance does so for his own good. Whosoever goes astray goes against his own soul. You are not their representative"
  39,42,God will receive their souls when they die. Their souls do not die when they are sleeping. During people's sleep He withholds those souls which He has decreed to die and releases the others for an appointed time. In this there is evidence (of the Truth) for the thoughtful people
  39,43,"Have they chosen intercessors besides God? Say, \"Would you choose them as your intercessors even though they do not possess anything and have no understanding"
  39,44,"Say, \"Intercession belongs to God. To Him belongs the heavens and the earth and to Him you will all return"
  39,45,"When one God is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Day of Judgment begin to shrink, but when the idols are mentioned, they rejoice"
  39,46,"Say, \"Lord, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, knower of the seen and unseen, it is You who will issue Your decree about the differences of Your servants"
  39,47,"Had the unjust possessed double the amount of the wealth of the whole earth, they would certainly have liked to offer it on the Day of Resurrection as redemption from the torment of Our scourge when God would make public what they had never expected"
