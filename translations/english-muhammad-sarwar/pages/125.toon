quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,104,"When they are told to refer to the guidance of God and to the Messenger, they say, \"The tradition of our fathers is sufficient for our guidance,\" even though, in fact, their fathers had neither knowledge nor proper guidance"
  5,105,"Believers, save your own souls, for if you have the right guidance, no one who strays can harm you. You will all return to God who will tell you about what you have done"
  5,106,"Believers, when death approaches any one of you, let two just men from your own people (Muslims) or any two other men (People of the Book) if death befalls you on a journey, bear witness to the bequest. If you have any doubts as to their honesty, detain them and let them take an oath after the prayer, each one of them saying, \"I swear by God that my testimony is true. I am not selling the Truth for a paltry price even though the beneficiary would be one of my relatives. I do not hide the testimony which is the right of God, for then I would be one of the sinners"
  5,107,"If their honesty is challenged, two others from the relatives of the deceased should swear in the same way and testify to the bequest saying, \"We swear by God that our testimony is the true one. We do not transgress in the matter lest we become unjust ones"
  5,108,This will help preserve a proper testimony because the witness will be afraid of the denial of their own testimony by a second pair of witness. Have fear of God and listen (properly). God does not guide the evil doing people
