  10,79,The Pharaoh ordered every skillful magician to come into his presence
  10,80,"When all the magicians were brought to his court, Moses asked them to cast down what they wanted to"

  10,88,"Moses said, \"Lord, You have given the Pharaoh and his people great riches and splendor in this life and this makes them stray from Your path. Lord, destroy their wealth and harden their hearts in disbelief so that they will suffer the most painful torment"
