quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,13,"Do they, (the unbelievers), say that (Muhammad) has falsely ascribed (the Quran) to God? Ask them, \"Compose ten chapters like (those of the Quran) and call on whomever you can for help besides God if you are true in your claim"
  11,14,"If they will not respond to you, know that God has sent it with His knowledge and that He is the only God. Will you then become Muslims"
  11,15,Those who choose the worldly life and its pleasures will be given proper recompense for their deeds in this life and will not suffer any loss
  11,16,Such people will receive nothing in the next life except Hell fire. Their deeds will be made devoid of all virtue and their efforts will be in vain
  11,17,"Should they be compared with those whose Lord has given them a guidance which is testified by a witness from among their own people and by the Book of Moses, a guide and a mercy. Such people do believe in this guidance (in the Quran). Those who disbelieve (in the Quran) will have hell as their dwelling place. Thus, (Muhammad), have no doubt about it (the Quran). It is certainly the truth from your Lord, yet many people do not have faith"
  11,18,"Who are more unjust than those who ascribe falsehood to God? When such people are brought into the presence of their Lord, the witness will say, \"These are the ones who told lies about their Lord. Certainly God will condemn the unjust"
  11,19,"who prevent others from the way of God, seek to make it appear crooked, and who have no faith in the life hereafter"
