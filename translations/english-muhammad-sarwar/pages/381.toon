  27,45,"We sent to the tribe of Thamud their brother Salih so that they would worship God, but they became two quarrelling groups"
  27,46,"Salih said, \"My people, why do you commit sins so quickly before doing good? Would that you ask forgiveness from God so that perhaps He will have mercy upon you"
  27,47,"They said, \"We have an ill omen about you and your followers.\" Salih replied, God has made your ill fortune await you. You are a people on trial"
  27,48,There were nine tribes in the city spreading evil without any reform in the land

  27,50,They plotted and We planned without their knowledge. Consider the result of their plot
  27,51,We destroyed them and their people altogether
