quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,60,"(Muhammad), have you seen those who think that they have faith in what is revealed to you and to others before you, yet choose to take their affairs to Satan for judgment even though they are commanded to deny him. Satan wants to lead them far away from the right path"
  4,61,"When the (hypocrites) are told to refer to God's revelations and to the Messenger, they try to find excuses to stay away from you (Muhammad)"
  4,62,"What would happen if they were to be afflicted by a disaster brought about by their own hands? They would then come to you swearing by God, \"We only wanted to bring about friendship and reconciliation"
  4,63,"God knows what is in their hearts. (Muhammad), ignore their faults, advise them, and tell them frankly about what is in their souls"
  4,64,"We did not send any Messengers for any reason other than to be obeyed because of the will of God. If they ever do injustice to themselves and come to you (Muhammad) asking for God's forgiveness and if the Messenger also was to ask God to forgive them, they would certainly find God All-forgiving and All-merciful"
  4,65,"I swear by your Lord that they will not be considered believers until they let you judge their disputes and then they will find nothing in their souls to prevent them from accepting your judgment, thus, submitting themselves to the will of God"
