quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,45,God knows who are your enemies. You need to have no guardian or helper other than God
  4,46,"Some Jews take certain words out of context and by twisting their tongues to make a jest out of the true religion, say, \"We heard and (in our hearts) disobeyed. (Muhammad) ra`ina (be kind to us) but they intend thereby (the meaning in their own language): \"Listen! May God turn you deaf.\" They should have said, \"We heard and obeyed. (Muhammad) listen and consider our question.\" This would have been better for them and more righteous. God has condemned them for their disbelief, thus, no one, except a few among them, will have faith"
  4,47,"People of the Book, have faith in the Quran that We have revealed to confirm your Book, before certain faces are changed and turned back. We shall condemn them as We did the people of the Sabbath about whom God's decree had decisively been ordained"
  4,48,"God does not forgive the sin of considering others equal to Him, but He may choose to forgive other sins. Whoever believes in other gods besides Him has indulged in a great sin"
  4,49,"(Muhammad), have you seen those who try to purify themselves? They should know that God only purifies whomever He wants and that the slightest wrong will not be done to such people"
  4,50,Consider how they create lies about God? This alone is a grave sin
  4,51,"Have you seen how those who had been given a share of the Book believe in idols and Satan and who say, \"The disbelievers are better guided than the believers"
