quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  18,16,"(They were told), \"Now that you have abandoned them and what they worship instead of God, seek refuge in the cave. God will, certainly, grant you mercy and provide you with help to safely get out of this trouble"
  18,17,No sunlight could reach them during their sleep in the cave. One could see the rising sun decline to the right of their cave and the setting sun move its way to the left whilst they were sleeping in an opening of the cave. This is one of the miracles of God. Whomever God guides receives the right guidance and you will never find a guardian or guide for those whom He causes to go astray
  18,18,"One would think them (the youths) awake while, in fact, they were sleeping. We turned their bodies from right to left and their dog stretched its front legs on the ground. Had one looked them over, he would have run away from them in terror"
  18,19,"We roused them from their sleep so that they would question each other about their stay in the cave. One of them said, \"How long do you think we have stayed here?\" They replied, \"A day or part of a day.\" They added, \" Your Lord knows better how long we have stayed here. Let us send one of us with this money to the city to get some pure food so that we might eat. He should be careful so that no one will know about us. If they were to recognize us"
  18,20,they would certainly stone us to death or force us to follow their religion. Then we shall never be able to have everlasting happiness
