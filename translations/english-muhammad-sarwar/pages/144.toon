quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,125,"God will open the hearts of whomever He wants to guide to Islam, but He will tighten the chest of one whom He has led astray, as though he was climbing high up into the sky. Thus, God places wickedness on those who do not accept the faith"
  6,126,This is the path of your Lord and it is straight. We have explained Our revelations to those who take heed
  6,127,They will live in peace with God. God protects them as a reward for their deeds; He is their Guardian
  6,128,"On the day when every one will be resurrected and the jinn will be told that they have made many people go astray, their friends from among people will say, \"Lord, we benefitted from each other until death approached us.\" They will be told that their dwelling will be fire wherein they will live forever unless God wills it to be otherwise. Your Lord is All-wise and All-knowing"
  6,129,Thus do We make the unjust friends of one another because of their evil deeds
  6,130,"When people and jinn are asked, \"Did not Messengers from your own people come to you to convey Our revelations and to warn you of the Day of Resurrection?\" They will reply, \"(Yes indeed).\" The worldly life deceived them. They will testify that they were unbelievers"
  6,131,"Your Lord did not want to destroy the towns, unjustly, without informing their inhabitants (of His guidance)"
