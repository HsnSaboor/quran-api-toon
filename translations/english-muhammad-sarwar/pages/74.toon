quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,181,"God certainly has heard the words of those who said, \"God is poor and we are wealthy\". We shall write down what they have said and their murder of the Prophets without reason and We shall tell them to suffer the burning torment"
  3,182,This is only the result of their deeds. God is not unjust to His servants
  3,183,"(Muhammad), say to those who say, 'God has commanded us not to believe any Messenger unless he offers a burnt offering,' (Muhammad) say, \"Messengers came to you before me with certain miracles and with that which you had asked for (burnt offering). Why, then, did you slay them if you were true in your claim"
  3,184,"If they reject you, they had certainly rejected the Messengers who lived before you and who showed them authoritative evidence, smaller Books, and the Book of enlightenment"
  3,185,Every soul is destined to experience the agony of death. You (Muslims) will receive the recompense for your deeds on the Day of Judgment. To be saved from the fire and admitted to Paradise is certainly a great triumph. The worldly life is no more than a deceitful possession
  3,186,"You (believers) will certainly be tested by the loss of your property and lives and you will hear a great many grieving words from the People of the Book and the pagans. If you will have patience and piety, it will be a sign of firm determination and steadfastness (in life)"
