quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"(Muhammad), say, \"I have no control over my benefits or sufferings, without the will of God. Had I known about the unseen, I would have gained much good and would have faced no suffering. I am only a warner and I preach the glad news to the believing people"
  7,189,"It is God Who created you from a single soul and out of it made its spouse to bring it comfort. When he (man) engaged in carnal relations with her, she conceived a light burden which she had to carry. When the baby grew in her womb, they (husband and wife) both prayed to their Lord, \"If You grant us a healthy son we shall certainly give you thanks"
  7,190,"When they were given a healthy son, they began to love him as much as they loved God. God is too exalted to be loved equally to anything else"
  7,191,Do they (the pagans) consider things that do not create anything but are themselves created equal to God
  7,192,The idols are things that are not able to help others or even themselves
  7,193,"Believers, even if you invite them to true guidance, they will not follow you. It makes no difference whether you invite them or whether you keep quiet"
  7,194,"Those whom you (pagans) worship besides God, are themselves servants just like yourselves. If your claim was true, they should answer your prayers"
  7,195,"Do they (the idols) have feet to walk, hands to hold things, eyes to see, and ears to hear? (Muhammad), tell them (the pagans) to call on their idols for help and to plan against Me without delay"
