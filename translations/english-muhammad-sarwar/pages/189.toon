  9,17,The pagans do not have any right to establish (and patronize) the mosque of God while they testify against their souls to its disbelief. Their deeds are devoid of all virtue and they will live forever in hell fire

In the sight of God you (pagans) are not equal to the believers. God does not guide the unjust"
  9,20,"To those who have believed in God, left their homes, and fought for His cause with their possessions and in person, God will grant high ranks and success"
