quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  43,11,It is He who has sent down water from the sky in a known measure by which He has given life to the dead earth. In the same way will you also be resurrected
  43,12,It is He who has created everything in pairs and the ships and cattle for you to ride
  43,13,"so that perhaps when you ride them, you will recall the bounties of your Lord and when you establish your control over it you would say, \"Glory belongs to Him who has made it subservient to us when we would not have been able to do so ourselves"
  43,14,To our Lord we shall all return
  43,15,The pagans have considered some of His servants as His children. There is no doubt that the human being is simply ungrateful
  43,16,Has God chosen some of His own creatures as daughters for Himself and has given you the preference of having sons
  43,17,"When one of them is given the glad news of the birth of a daughter, which they believe to be the only kind of child that the Beneficent God can have, his face blackens with anger"
  43,18,Does God choose for Himself the kind of children who grow up wearing ornaments and who are not strong enough to defend their rights
  43,19,"Do they say that the angels, who are the servants of the Beneficent God, are females? Have they witnessed their creation? Their words as such will be recorded and they will be questioned for it"
  43,20,"The pagans say, \"Had the Beneficent God wanted, we would not have worshipped them (idols).\" Whatever they say is not based on knowledge. It is only a false conjecture"
  43,21,"Had We, before sending the Quran, given them a book to which they now refer as an authority"
  43,22,"In fact, they say, \"We found our fathers following a certain belief and we now follow in their footsteps for our guidance"
