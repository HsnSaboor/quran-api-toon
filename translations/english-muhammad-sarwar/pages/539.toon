quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  57,12,"On the Day of Judgment you will see the believers with their light shining in front of them and to their right. They will be told, \"Paradise wherein streams flow is the glad news for you today. You will live therein forever. This is the greatest triumph"
  57,13,"On that day the hypocrites will say to the believers, \"Please look at us so that we might benefit from your light.\" They will be told, \"Go back and search for your own light.\" A barrier with a door will be placed between them. Inside it there will be mercy but outside of it there will be torment"
  57,14,"(Those outside) will call out, \"Were we not with you?\" (Those inside) will reply, \"Yes, you were with us but you spent your life in disbelief and hypocrisy, wished death to (Muhammad), had doubts about his message and let your longings deceive you until the decree of God came to pass. The devil deceived you about the mercy of God"
