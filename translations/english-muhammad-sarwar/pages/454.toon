quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,17,"(Muhammad), bear patiently what they say and recall Our servant, David, who had strong hands and who was most repentant"
  38,18,We made the mountains join him in glorifying Us in the evening and in the morning
  38,19,We made the birds assemble around him in flocks
  38,20,"We strengthened his kingdom, giving him wisdom and the power of sound Judgment"
  38,21,Have you heard the news of the disputing parties who climbed the walls of the prayer room
  38,22,"and entered where David was (praying). He was frightened, so they said, \"Do not be afraid. We are only two disputing parties of which one of us has transgressed against the other. Judge between us with truth and justice and guide us to the right path"
  38,23,"One of them said, \"This is my brother who has ninety-nine ewes when I have only one. He has demanded me to place that one in his custody; he had the stronger argument"
  38,24,"David said, \"He has certainly been unjust in demanding your ewe from you. Most partners transgress against each other except for the righteously striving believers who are very few.\" David realized that it was a test from Us so he asked forgiveness from his Lord and knelt down before him in repentance"
  38,25,We forgave him for this. In Our eyes he certainly has a good position and the best share (of the world to come)
  38,26,"We told him. \"David, We have appointed you as Our deputy on earth so judge among the people with truth. Do not follow (worldly) desires lest you go astray from the way of God. Those who go astray from the way of God will suffer severe torment for forgetting the Day of Reckoning"
