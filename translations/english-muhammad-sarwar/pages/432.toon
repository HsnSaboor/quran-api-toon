quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,32,"The suppressing ones will say to the oppressed ones, \"Did we prevent you from having guidance after it had come to you? In fact, you yourselves were criminals"
  34,33,"The oppressed ones will say to them, \"It was you who planned night and day, ordering us to disbelieve God, and consider other things equal to Him.\" They will hide their regret on seeing their torment. We shall chain the necks of the disbelievers. Can they be recompensed with other than what they deserved for their deeds"
  34,34,"Every time We sent a warner to a town, the rich ones therein said (to Our Messenger), \"We have no faith in what you have brought (to us)"
  34,35,We are the ones who have more wealth and children and we shall suffer no punishment
  34,36,"Say, \"My Lord increases and determines the sustenance of whomever He wants, but most people do not know"
  34,37,Your property and children cannot bring you closer to Us. Only those who believe and act righteously will have double reward for their deeds and will live in secure mansions
  34,38,Those who try to challenge Our revelations will be driven into torment
  34,39,"Say, \"It is my Lord who determines and increases the sustenance of whomever He wants. He will replace whatever you spend for His cause and He is the best Sustainer"
