quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,41,"Whether unarmed or well equipped, march and fight for the cause of God with your possessions and in person. This would be better for you, if only you knew it"
  9,42,"Had the gain been immediate or the journey shorter, they (hypocrites) would certainly have followed you, (Muhammad), but it was too far for them. They will swear by God, \"Had we had the ability, we would certainly have marched with you.\" They destroy only themselves and God knows that they are lying"
  9,43,"May God forgive you! (Muhammad), why did you not let them join the army so that you could discern the liars from the truthful ones"
  9,44,"Those who believe in God and the Day of Judgment do not ask you whether they should fight for the cause of God with their property and in person, or not. God knows all about the pious ones"
  9,45,Only those who do not believe in God and the Day of Judgment ask you such questions because their hearts are full of doubts and they cannot make any final decisions
  9,46,"Had they (the hypocrites) wanted to join your army, they would have prepared themselves, but God did not wish to motivate them, so He caused them to linger behind with those whose joining you in battle would be of no use"
  9,47,"Had they joined you, they would have been of no help to you but would have just caused confusion and trouble among you by sneaking through the ranks where some of you would be ready to listen to them. God knows best the unjust"
