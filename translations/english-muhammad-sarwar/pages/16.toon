quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,102,"They followed the incantations that the devils used against the kingdom of Solomon. Solomon did not hide the truth but the devils did. They taught magic to the people and whatever was revealed to the two angels, Harut and Marut, in Babylon. The two angels did not teach anything to anyone without saying, \"Our case is a temptation for the people, so do not hide the truth.\" People learned something from the two angels that could cause discord between a man and his wife. However, they could harm no one except by the permission of God. In fact, the (people) learned things that would harm them and render them no benefit. They knew very well that one who engaged in witchcraft would have no reward in the life hereafter. Would that they had known that they had sold their souls for that which is vile"
  2,103,"Would that they had known that if they had embraced the faith and avoided evil, they would have received better rewards from God"
  2,104,"Believers, do not address the Prophet as ra'ina (whereby the Jews, in their own accent, meant: Would that you would never hear, but call him unzurna) (meaning: Please speak to us slowly so that we understand), and then listen. The unbelievers will face a painful torment"
  2,105,(Muhammad) the disbelievers among the People of the Book and the pagans do not like to see anything good revealed to you from your Lord. God reserves His mercy for whomever He chooses. The generosity of God is great
