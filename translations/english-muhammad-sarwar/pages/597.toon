quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,"By the fig, by the olive"
  95,2,by Mount Sinai
  95,3,"and by this inviolable city, Mecca"
  95,4,We have created the human being in the best form
  95,5,and We shall make him the lowest of low
  95,6,except the righteously striving believers who will have a never ending reward
  95,7,"After (knowing) this, what makes you still disbelieve in the Day of Judgment"
  95,8,Is God not the best of the Judges
  96,1,"(Muhammad), read in the name of your Lord who created (all things)"
  96,2,He created man from a clot of blood
  96,3,Recite! Your Lord is the most Honorable One
  96,4,"who, by the pen, taught the human being"
  96,5,He taught the human being what he did not know
  96,6,"Despite this, the human being still tends to rebel"
  96,7,because he thinks that he is independent
  96,8,"However, (all things) will return to your Lord"
  96,9,Have you seen the one who prohibits
  96,10,a servant of Ours from prayer
  96,11,What will happen if the praying person is rightly guided
  96,12,or if he commands others to maintain piety
  96,13,What will happen if the prohibiting rejects the Truth and turns away from it
  96,14,Does he not realize that God sees him
  96,15,"Let him know that if he does not desist, We shall certainly drag him by his forelocks"
  96,16,his lying sinful forelock
  96,17,Let him call on his associates for help
  96,18,and We too will call the stern and angry keepers of hell
  96,19,"(Muhammad), never yield to him! Prostrate yourself and try to come closer to God"
