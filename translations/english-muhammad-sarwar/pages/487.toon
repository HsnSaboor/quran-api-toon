quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  42,32,Further evidence (of His existence) are the ships which stand as mountains in the sea
  42,33,"Had He wanted, He could have stopped the wind and let the ships remain motionless on the surface of the sea, in this there is evidence (of the Truth) for all those who are patient and grateful"
  42,34,"or He could have destroyed them as punishment for the human being's deeds. However, God pardons many sins"
  42,35,He knows all those who dispute His revelations. They will find no way to escape from (His torment)
  42,36,Whatever you have received is just a means of enjoyment for this life but the reward of God for the believers and those who trust in their Lord will be better and everlasting
  42,37,"(This reward will be for) those who keep away from major sins and indecency, who forgive when they are made angry"
  42,38,"who have pledged their obedience to the Lord, who are steadfast in prayer, who conduct their affairs with consultation among themselves, who spend for the cause of God out of what We have given them"
  42,39,"and those who, when suffering a great injustice, seek to defend themselves"
  42,40,"The recompense for evil will be equivalent to the deed. He who pardons (the evil done to him) and reforms himself, will receive his reward from God. God certainly does not love the unjust"
  42,41,Those who successfully defend themselves after being wronged will not be questioned
  42,42,Only those who do injustice to people and commit rebellion on earth for no reason will be questioned. They will suffer a painful torment
  42,43,To exercise patience and forgive (the wrong done to one) is the proof of genuine determination
  42,44,"Whomever God has caused to go astray will find no guardian after this. You will see the unjust, on facing the torment, say, \"Is there any way to turn back"
