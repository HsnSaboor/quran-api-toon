quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  20,88,"Then the Samiri forged the body of a motionless calf which gave out a hollow sound.\" The people said, \"This is your Lord and the Lord of Moses whom he (Moses) forgot to mention"
  20,89,"Did they not consider that the calf could not give them any answer, nor it could harm or benefit them"
  20,90,"Aaron had told them before, \"My people, you are deceived by the calf. Your Lord is the Beneficent God. Follow me and obey my orders"
  20,91,"They said, \"We shall continue worshipping the calf until Moses comes back"
  20,92,"Then Moses asked Aaron, \"What made you not follow me when you saw them in error"
  20,93,Did you disobey my orders
  20,94,"Aaron replied, \"Son of my mother, do not seize me by my beard or head. I was afraid that you might consider me responsible for causing discord among the children of Israel and would not pay attention to my words"
  20,95,"Moses asked, \"Samiri, what were your motives"
  20,96,"He replied, \"I had the skill (of carving) which they did not have. I followed some of the Messengers's (Moses) tradition, but I then ignored it. Thus, my soul prompted me (to carve a golden calf with an artificial hollow sound)"
  20,97,"Moses said, \"Go away! Throughout your life you will not be able to let anyone touch you. This will be your punishment in this life. The time for your final punishment is inevitable. You will never be able to avoid it. Look at your god which you have been worshipping. We will burn it in the fire and scatter its ashes into the sea"
  20,98,Your Lord is the One who is the only God and He has the knowledge of all things
