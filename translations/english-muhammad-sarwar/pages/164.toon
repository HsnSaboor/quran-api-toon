quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  7,105,"I must only speak what is true about God. I have brought you miracles from your Lord; therefore, let the children of Israel go free"
  7,106,The Pharaoh asked Moses to show his miracles if he was telling the truth
  7,107,So Moses threw down his staff and suddenly it turned into a real serpent
  7,108,Then he uncovered his hand and it appeared sheer white to the onlookers
  7,109,Some of the Pharaoh's nobles considered him to be no more than a skillful magician
  7,110,"and said, \"He wants to expel you from your land.\" They asked (others), \" what is your opinion in the matter"
  7,111,The others suggested holding Moses and his brother off and sending to all the cities
  7,112,to bring together at the Pharaohs court all the skillful magicians
  7,113,"The magicians came to the Pharaoh and said, \"We must have our reward if we are to gain a victory over him (Moses)"
  7,114,"The Pharaoh replied, \"In addition to your rewards, you will become my close friends thereafter"
  7,115,"The magicians asked Moses, \"Will you throw your staff first or shall we"
  7,116,"He replied, \"Throw yours first.\" Their great magic bewitched people's eyes and terrified them"
  7,117,"We inspired Moses to throw his staff, and suddenly it began to swallow-up all that the magicians had (falsely) invented"
  7,118,Thus the Truth prevailed and their false art was banished
  7,119,The magicians who were defeated on the spot and were proved to be worthless
  7,120,threw themselves down in prostration
