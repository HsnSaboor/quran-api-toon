  7,150,"When Moses returned to his people with anger and sorrow, he said, \"What you have done in my absence is certainly evil. Why were you hasty about the commandments of your Lord?\" He threw away the Tablets (which contained the commandments of God), grabbed his brother and started to pull him to himself. His brother begged him saying, \"Son of my mother, the people suppressed me and almost killed me. Do not humiliate me before the enemies or call me unjust"
  7,151,"Moses prayed, \"Lord, forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your mercy; you are the most Merciful"
  7,152,"(The Lord said), \"Those who worshipped the calf will be afflicted by the wrath of their Lord and disgraced in their worldly life. Thus, We will recompense those who invent falsehood"
  7,153,"To those who commit bad deeds, but, then, repent and believe (in God), Your Lord will certainly be All-forgiving and All-merciful"
  7,154,"When Moses' anger calmed down, he collected the Tablets. On one of them was written, \"God's mercy and guidance are for those who have fear of Him"
  7,155,"Moses selected seventy men from his people to attend Our appointment. (In Our presence). When an earthquake jolted them to death, Moses said, \"Lord, had You wanted to destroy them, why did You not destroy them and me before. Are You destroying us for what the fools among us have done? This (destruction) is only a trial through which You cause some to go astray and guide others. You are our Guardian. Forgive us and have mercy on us; You are the best of those who forgive"
