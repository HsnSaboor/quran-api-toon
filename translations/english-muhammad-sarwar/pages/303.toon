quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  18,84,We had given him great power in the land and all kinds of resources
  18,85,With these he traveled
  18,86,"to the West where he found the sun setting into a warm source (spring) of water and a people living near by. We asked him, \"Dhu 'l-Qarnayn, you may punish them or treat them with kindness"
  18,87,"He replied, \"I shall punish the unjust ones among them and then they will return to their Lord, who will punish them more sternly"
  18,88,"As for those who believe and do good, they will receive virtuous rewards and We will tell them to do only what they can"
  18,89,He travelled again
  18,90,to the East where he found the sun rising upon a people whom We had exposed to its rays
  18,91,This indeed was true. We knew all that he did there
  18,92,He travelled
  18,93,after this to the middle of two mountains where he found a people who could hardly understand a single word
  18,94,"They said, \"Dhu 'l-Qarnayn, Gog and Magog are ravaging this land. Would you establish a barrier between us and them if we pay you a certain tax"
  18,95,"He replied, \"The power that my Lord has granted me is better (than your tax). Help me with your man-power and I shall construct a barrier between you and Gog and Magog"
  18,96,"Bring me blocks of iron to fill up the passage between the two mountains.\" He told them to ply their bellows until the iron became hot as fire. Then he told them to pour on it molten brass"
  18,97,(Thus he constructed the barrier which) neither Gog nor Magog were able to climb nor were they able to dig a tunnel through the iron and brass barrier
