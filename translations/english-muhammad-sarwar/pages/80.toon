quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,15,"Those of your women who commit fornication, let four (Muslim) witness testify to their act. If there is sufficient testimony, confine them to their homes until they die, or until God provides a way for their freedom"
  4,16,"If any two people commit fornication, punish them. If they repent and reform, let them go. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful"
  4,17,"God will only accept the repentance of those who commit evil in ignorance, if they repent immediately. God is All-knowing and All-wise"
  4,18,There is no forgiveness for those who commit sin and do not repent until the last moment of their lives nor for those who die as unbelievers. For these people We have prepared a painful torment
  4,19,"Believers, it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will as part of the legacy. Do not create difficulties for your wives in order to force them to give-up part of what you had given to them to set themselves free from the bond of marriage, unless they have clearly committed adultery. Always treat them reasonably. If you dislike them, you could be disliking that which God has filled with abundant good"
