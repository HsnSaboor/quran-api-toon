quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the heavens and al-tariq
  86,2,Do you know what al-tariq is
  86,3,It is a nightly radiant star
  86,4,There is no soul which is not guarded (by the two angels who record all of its deeds)
  86,5,Let the human being reflect that from what he has been created
  86,6,He has been created from an ejected drop of fluid
  86,7,which comes out of the loins and ribs
  86,8,God has all power to resurrect him
  86,9,On the day when all secrets will be made public
  86,10,"he will have no power, nor anyone to help him"
  86,11,By the rotating heavens
  86,12,and the replenishing earth
  86,13,the Quran is the final word
  86,14,and it is certainly not a jest
  86,15,They (disbelievers) plot every evil plan
  86,16,but I too plan against them
  86,17,Give respite to the disbelievers and leave them alone for a while
  87,1,"(Muhammad), glorify the Name of your lord, the Most High"
  87,2,Who has created (all things) proportionately
  87,3,"decreed their destinies, and provided them with guidance"
  87,4,It is He who has caused the grass to grow
  87,5,then caused it to wither away
  87,6,We shall teach you (the Quran) and you will not forget it
  87,7,unless God wills it to be otherwise. He knows all that is made public and all that remains hidden
  87,8,We shall make all your tasks easy
  87,9,"Therefore, keep on preaching as long as it is of benefit"
  87,10,Those who have fear of God will benefit
  87,11,but the reprobates will turn away
  87,12,and suffer the heat of the great fire
  87,13,wherein they will neither live nor die
  87,14,Lasting happiness will be for those who purify themselves
  87,15,"remember the name of the Lord, and pray to Him"
