quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  24,62,"The true believers are those who have faith in God and His Messenger and when they are dealing with the Messenger in important matters, they do not leave without his permission. (Muhammad), those who ask your permission believe in God and His Messenger. When they ask your leave to attend to their affairs, you may give permission to anyone of them you choose and ask forgiveness for them from God. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful"
  24,63,"Do not address the Messenger as you would call each other. God knows those who secretly walk away from you and hide themselves. Those who oppose the Messengers should beware, lest some trouble or a painful torment should befall them"
  24,64,"The heavens and the earth, certainly, belong to God. He surely knows all about you in this life. On the day when you return to Him, He will tell you all about whatever you have done. God has the knowledge of all things"
  25,1,Blessed is He who has revealed the criteria (for discerning truth from falsehood) to His servant so that He could warn mankind
  25,2,"To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He has not begotten any sons, nor does He have any partner in His kingdom. He has created all things with precisely accurate planning"
