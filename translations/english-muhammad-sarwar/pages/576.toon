quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,He planned and plotted
  74,19,May he be condemned
  74,20,What an evil plan he has made
  74,21,May he be condemned again for his schemes! He looked around
  74,22,frowned and scowled
  74,23,"then turned back, and swelling-up with pride"
  74,24,"said, \"This (the Quran) is nothing but magic, inherited from ancient magicians"
  74,25,These are only words from a mere mortal
  74,26,I shall make him suffer the torment of hell
  74,27,Would that you really knew what hell is
  74,28,It leaves and spares no one and nothing
  74,29,It scorches people's skin
  74,30,and it has nineteen angelic keepers
  74,31,"We have made only angels as the keepers of the fire (for they are the strongest in carrying out Our commands). Our informing (people) of the numbers of these angels is a trial for the disbelievers. It gives more certainty to the people of the Book and strengthens the faith of the believers. The people of the Book and the believers have no doubt about it. We have fixed the number to make the disbelievers and those whose hearts are sick say, \"What does God mean by such a parable?\" Thus, God guides and causes to go astray whomever He wants. No one knows about the army of your Lord except He Himself. This parable is a reminder for mankind"
  74,32,By the moon
  74,33,by the retreating night
  74,34,by the brightening dawn
  74,35,hell is certainly the greatest calamity
  74,36,It is a warning for mankind
  74,37,whether one steps forward to embrace the faith or one turns away from it
  74,38,Every soul will be in captivity for its deeds
  74,39,except the people of the right hand
  74,40,who will be in Paradise
  74,41,and will ask of the criminals
  74,42,what led you into hell
  74,43,"They will reply, \"We did not pray"
  74,44,nor did we feed the destitute
  74,45,We indulged and persisted in useless disputes
  74,46,and rejected the Day of Judgment
  74,47,until death approached us
