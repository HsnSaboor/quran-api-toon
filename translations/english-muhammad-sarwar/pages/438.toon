quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  35,31,Whatever We have revealed to you from the Book is all truth. It confirms what was revealed before. God sees His servants and is All-aware of them
  35,32,"We gave the Book as an inheritance to Our chosen servants, among whom some are unjust against their souls, some are moderate, and some are exceedingly virtuous by the permission of God. This is indeed a great favor"
  35,33,"They will enter the gardens of Eden wherein they will be decked with bracelets of gold, pearls, and silk garments"
  35,34,"They will say, \"It is only God who deserves all praise. He has removed all of our suffering. Our Lord is certainly All-forgiving and All-appreciating"
  35,35,"It is He who has granted us, through His favor, an everlasting dwelling wherein we shall experience no hardship nor any fatigue"
  35,36,The unbelievers will dwell in hell. It will not be decreed for them to die nor will their torment be relieved. Thus do We recompense the ungrateful ones
  35,37,"Therein they will cry-out, \"Lord, take us out of here. We shall act righteously and behave different to what we did before.\" They will be told, \"Did We not allow you to live long enough for you to seek guidance? Did We not send a warner to you? Suffer (the torment). There is no one to help the unjust"
  35,38,God has knowledge of whatever is unseen in the heavens and the earth. He knows best what the hearts contain
