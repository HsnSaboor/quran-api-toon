quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"The believers say, \"Why is a chapter about jihad - fighting for the cause of God - not revealed?\" But when such a chapter, with clear commands and a mention of jihad is revealed, you will see those whose hearts are sick look at you as if suffering the agony of death. One can expect nothing better from them"
  47,21,"Since they have (pledged) Us obedience and to speak reasonably, it would be more proper for them, when it is decided (that everyone must take part in the battle), to remain true (in their pledge to God)"
  47,22,If you ignore the commands of God would you then also spread evil in the land and sever the ties of kinship
  47,23,"God has condemned these people and made them deaf, dumb, and blind"
  47,24,Is it that they do not think about the Quran or are their hearts sealed
  47,25,"Those who have reverted to disbelief after guidance has become manifest to them, have been seduced and given false hopes by satan"
  47,26,"This is because they have said to those who hate God's revelation, \"We shall obey you in some matters.\" But God knows all their secrets"
  47,27,How terrible it will be for them when the angels take away their souls by striking their faces and their backs
  47,28,"for their following that which had incurred God's anger, and their hatred to please God. Thus, God has made their deeds devoid of all virtue"
  47,29,Do those whose hearts are sick think that God will never make their malice public
