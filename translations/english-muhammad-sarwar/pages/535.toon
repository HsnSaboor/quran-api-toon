quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,Immortal youths will serve them
  56,18,"with goblets, jugs and cups of crystal clear wine"
  56,19,which will not cause them any intoxication or illness
  56,20,"Also, they will be served with the fruits of their choice"
  56,21,"and the flesh of birds, as they desire"
  56,22,"They will have maidens with large, lovely black and white eyes"
  56,23,like pearls preserved in their shells
  56,24,as reward for their deeds
  56,25,They will not hear any unnecessary or sinful talk
  56,26,"except each other's greetings of, \"Peace be with you"
  56,27,"As for the people of the right hand, how happy they will be"
  56,28,They will live amid the thornless lot trees
  56,29,and banana trees
  56,30,with fruits piled up one on the other
  56,31,and amid the extended shade
  56,32,near to flowing water
  56,33,and abundant fruits
  56,34,undiminished and never denied
  56,35,and the noble maidens
  56,36,that We have created (for the people of the right hand)
  56,37,We have made them virgins
  56,38,loving and of equal age
  56,39,These (people of the right hand) consist of many from the ancient
  56,40,and many from the later generations
  56,41,"As for the people on the left hand, how miserable they will be"
  56,42,They will live amid the scorching
  56,43,scalding water and under a shadow of black smoke
  56,44,neither cold nor graceful in shape
  56,45,They had lived in luxury before this
  56,46,and persisted in heinous sins
  56,47,"It was they who said, \"Shall we be resurrected after we die and have turned into dust and bones"
  56,48,Will our ancient forefathers be resurrected too
  56,49,"(Muhammad), say, \"All the ancient and later generations"
  56,50,will be brought together for an appointment on an appointed day
