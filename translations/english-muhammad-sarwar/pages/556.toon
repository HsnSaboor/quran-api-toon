quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  64,1,All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify God. To Him belongs the Kingdom and all praise. He has power over all things
  64,2,It is He who has created you all but some of you have accepted the faith and some of you have not. God is Well Aware of what you do
  64,3,He has created the heavens and the earth for a genuine purpose and has formed you in the best shape. To Him all things return
  64,4,He knows all that is in the heavens and the earth and all that you reveal or conceal. God knows best whatever the hearts contain
  64,5,Have you not received the news about the disbelievers living before you who suffered the consequences of their deeds and will suffer a painful torment
  64,6,"This was because their messengers came to them with clear proof (to support their prophethood) and they said, \"Can mere mortals provide us with guidance?\" They rejected the Messengers and turned away. God does not need the worship of anyone. He is Self-sufficient and Praiseworthy"
  64,7,"The disbelievers have thought that they would never be resurrected (Muhammad). Say, \"I swear by my Lord that you will certainly be resurrected and will be told about all that you have done.\" All this is certainly very easy for God"
  64,8,"Thus, have faith in God, His Messenger and the Light which We have revealed. God is Well-Aware of what you do"
  64,9,"On the day when We shall gather you all together (for the Day of Judgment), all cheating will be exposed. Those who believe in God and act righteously will receive forgiveness for their sins. They will be admitted into Paradise wherein streams flow and they will live forever. This certainly is the greatest triumph"
