quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,80,"God has made your house the place for you to rest. He has also made homes for you out of the skins of cattle which are easy to carry along on a journey or at a camp. He has made wool, fur and the hair of cattle a temporary means of enjoyment for you"
  16,81,God has provided shade for you out of what He has created and places of retreat out of mountains. He has given you garments to protect you from the heat and cover your private parts. This is how He perfects His bounties to you so that perhaps you would submit to His will
  16,82,"(Muhammad), if they turn away, your only duty is to clearly preach to them"
  16,83,They recognize the bounties of God but they refuse them and most of them are unbelievers
  16,84,"On the day when We will call a witness from every nation, the disbelievers will not be given permission for anything, nor will they be allowed to seek solicitation"
  16,85,There will be no relief for them when the torment approaches the unjust nor will they be given any respite
  16,86,"When the idolators see their idols, they will say, \"Lord, these are the idols whom we worshipped instead of you.\" But the idols will say, \"They are liars"
  16,87,(On the Day of Judgment) the disbelievers will submit themselves to God and whatever they had falsely invented will disappear
