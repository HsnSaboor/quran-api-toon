  4,106,Seek forgiveness from God. He is All-forgiving and All-merciful
  4,107,Do not defend those who deceive themselves; God does not love those who are treacherous and sinful
  4,108,"They hide their sins from other people but they cannot hide themselves from God who is constantly with them, even when they hold nocturnal meetings, a thing which God does not like. God comprehends all that they do"
  4,109,You defend them in this life but who will defend them against God on the Day of Judgment and who will be their attorney
  4,110,"One who commits a sin or does wrong to himself and then seeks forgiveness from God, will find God All-forgiving and All-merciful"
  4,111,One who commits sins has committed them against his own soul. God is All-knowing and All-wise
  4,112,"One who makes a mistake or commits a sin and ascribes it to an innocent person, he only burdens himself with slander and a grave sin"
  4,113,"Were it not for the favor and mercy of God, some of them would have certainly tried to make you (Muhammad) go astray. However, they cannot lead any one astray but themselves nor can they harm you. God has revealed the Book to you, has given you wisdom, and has taught you what you did not know. Certainly God's favor to you has been great"
