quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  49,12,"Believers, stay away from conjecture; acting upon some conjecture may lead to sin. Do not spy on one another or back-bite. Would any of you like to eat the disgusting dead flesh of your brother? Have fear of God; God accepts repentance and is All-merciful"
  49,13,"People, We have created you all male and female and have made you nations and tribes so that you would recognize each other. The most honorable among you in the sight of God is the most pious of you. God is All-knowing and All-aware"
  49,14,"The bedouin Arabs have said, \"We are believers.\" Tell them, \"You are not believers, but you should say that you are Muslims. In fact, belief has not yet entered your hearts. If you obey God and His Messenger, nothing will be reduced from your deeds. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful"
  49,15,"The believers are those who believe in God and His Messenger, who do not change their belief into doubt and who strive hard for the cause of God with their property and persons. They are the truthful ones"
  49,16,"(Muhammad), say, \"Do you teach God about your religion? God knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth. He has the knowledge of all things"
  49,17,"(The bedouins tell you that) you owe them (a great deal) for their embracing Islam. Tell them, \"You are not doing me any favors by embracing Islam. In fact, it is God who has done you a great favor by guiding you to the faith. (Think about this) if you are people of truth"
  49,18,God knows whatever is unseen in the heavens and in the earth. He is Well Aware of what you do
