quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"(Muhammad), ask them,\"Can any of your idols create something (cause it to die), and then bring it back to life again?\" Say, \"Only God can originate the creation and bring it to life again. Where have you strayed"
  10,35,"(Muhammad), ask them, \"Can any of your idols guide you to the Truth?\" Say, \"Only God guides to the Truth.\" Is the one who guides to the Truth a proper guide or one who himself cannot find guidance unless he is guided (by others)? What is wrong with you that you judge (so unjustly)"
  10,36,Most of the unbelievers follow only conjecture which certainly cannot serve as a substitute for the Truth. God knows well what they do
  10,37,No one could have composed this Quran besides God. This confirms the existing Book (the Bible) and explains itself. There is no doubt that it is from the Lord of the Universe
  10,38,"Do they say that Muhammad has invented it? (Muhammad), tell them, \"If your claim is true, compose only one chapter like it and call on anyone besides God for help"
  10,39,They call a lie something that is beyond the limit of their knowledge and whose interpretation has not yet been revealed. Some people who lived before them also called Our revelations lies. Consider how terrible was the end of the unjust people
  10,40,Some of them believe in the Quran and others do not. Your Lord knows best the evil doers
  10,41,"If they call you a liar, tell them, \"Let each one of us follow his own way. You will not be responsible for what I do and I will not be responsible for what you do"
  10,42,"Some of them will listen to you, but are you supposed to make the deaf hear even if they have no understanding"
