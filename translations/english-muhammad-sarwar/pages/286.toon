quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,39,"(Muhammad), these are words of wisdom which your Lord has revealed to you. Do not consider anything equal to God lest you be thrown into hell, despised, and driven away from God's mercy"
  17,40,(Pagans) has your Lord given you preference over Himself by granting you sons and taking the angels as His own daughters? What you say is a monstrous utterance
  17,41,"We have given you various facts (about the Truth in this Quran) so that they (unbelievers) would take heed, but this has only increased their aversion (to the truth)"
  17,42,"(Muhammad), ask them, \"Had there been many other gods besides Him, as they say, they should have found a way to the Lord of the Throne"
  17,43,(to challenge Him). God is too Glorious and Exalted to be considered as they believe Him to be. He is the most High and Great
  17,44,"The seven heavens, the earth, and whatever is between them all glorify Him. There is nothing that does not glorify Him and always praise him, but you do not understand their praise and glorification. He is All-forbearing and All-forgiving"
  17,45,When you recite the Quran We place a curtain as a barrier between you and those who do not believe in the life to come
  17,46,"We put a veil over their hearts so that they cannot understand it. We deafen their ears. When you mention your Lord in this Quran as One (Supreme Being), they run away"
  17,47,"We know what they want to hear when they listen to you. They whisper to each other and say, \"You are only following a bewitched person"
  17,48,Consider what they have called you. They have certainly gone astray and cannot find the right path
  17,49,"The pagans say, \"When we become mere bones and dust, shall we then be brought back to life again"
