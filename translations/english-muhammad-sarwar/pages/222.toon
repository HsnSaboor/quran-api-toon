quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,6,There is no living creature on earth that does not receive sustenance from God. He knows its dwelling and resting place. Everything is recorded in the glorious Book
  11,7,"God created the heavens and the earth in six days. His Throne existed on water so that He could test you and find out those among you who do good deeds. (Muhammad), if you were to tell them that after death they would be brought back to life again, the unbelievers would say, \"This is nothing but obvious magic"
  11,8,"If We delay in afflicting them with Our punishment for an appointed time, they ask, \"What is preventing it (the punishment) from taking place?\" On the day when it (punishment) befalls them, no one will be able to escape from it and that which they have mocked will surround them from all sides"
  11,9,We grant a favor to the human being and then take it away from him. He becomes despairing and ungrateful
  11,10,"If after his hardship, We grant him a blessing, he grows proud and rejoicing and says, \"All my hardships have gone"
  11,11,But those who exercise patience and do good works do not behave as such. They will receive forgiveness and a great reward (from the Lord)
  11,12,"Perhaps you, (Muhammad), may by chance leave (untold) a part of that which is revealed to you and feel grieved because they say, \"Why has some treasure not been sent to him or an angel sent down with him?\" Say, \"I have come only to warn you.\" God is the Guardian of all things"
