quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  31,12,We gave wisdom to Luqman so that he would give thanks to God. Those who give thanks to God do so for their own good. Those who are ungrateful should know that God is Self-sufficient and Praiseworthy
  31,13,"Luqman advised his son telling him, \"My son, do not consider anything equal to God, for it is the greatest injustice"
  31,14,"(Concerning his parents), We advised the man, whose mother bears him with great pain and breast-feeds him for two years, to give thanks to Me first and then to them, to Me all things proceed"
  31,15,"If they try to force you to consider things equal to Me, which you cannot justify, equal to Me, do not obey them. Maintain lawful relations with them in this world and follow the path of those who turn in repentance to Me. To Me you will all return and I shall tell you all that you have done"
  31,16,"My son, God keeps the records of all the good and evil deeds, even if they are as small as a grain of mustard seed, hidden in a rock or in the heavens or the earth. God is subtle and All-aware"
  31,17,"My son, be steadfast in prayer. Make others do good. Prevent them from doing evil. Be patient in hardship. Patience comes from faith and determination"
  31,18,Do not scornfully turn your face away from people. Do not walk around puffed-up with pride; God does not love arrogant and boastful people
  31,19,Be moderate in your walking and your talking. The most unpleasant sound is the braying of donkeys
