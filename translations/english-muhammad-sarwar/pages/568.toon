quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,"On this day, they will have no friends"
  69,36,and no food except pus
  69,37,which only the sinners eat
  69,38,I do not need to swear by what you see
  69,39,and what you do not see
  69,40,because the Quran is certainly the word of a reverent messenger
  69,41,It is not the word of a poet but only a few of you have faith
  69,42,nor is it the work of a soothsayer but only a few of you take heed
  69,43,It is a revelation from the Lord of the Universe
  69,44,Had Muhammad invented some words against Us
  69,45,We would have caught hold of him by his right hand
  69,46,and cut-off his main artery
  69,47,None of you would be able to prevent Us from doing this to him
  69,48,The Quran is certainly a reminder for the pious ones
  69,49,We certainly know that some of you have rejected it
  69,50,and (on the Day of Judgment) this will be a great source of regret for the unbelievers
  69,51,This is the Truth beyond any doubt
  69,52,"(Muhammad), glorify the name of your Lord, the Great One"
  70,1,Someone has (needlessly) demanded to experience the torment (of God)
  70,2,which will inevitably seize the disbelievers
  70,3,"No one can defend him against God, the Lord of the exalted positions"
  70,4,"On that Day (of Judgment), long as fifty thousand years, the angels and the Spirit will ascend to Him"
  70,5,"(Muhammad), exercise patience with no complaints"
  70,6,They think that it (the Day of Judgment) is far away
  70,7,but We see it to be very near
  70,8,On the day when the heavens become like molten metal
  70,9,and the mountains become like wool
  70,10,even intimate friends will not inquire about their friends
