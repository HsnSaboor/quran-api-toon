quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,that this is an honorable Quran
  56,78,preserved in a hidden Book which
  56,79,no one can touch it except the purified ones
  56,80,(This Quran) is a revelation from the Lord of the Universe
  56,81,Would you say that this statement is a lie
  56,82,Would you reject the sustenance that you receive rather than give thanks
  56,83,Why can you not help a soul dying
  56,84,right before your very eyes
  56,85,"We are closer to him than you, but you cannot see"
  56,86,If you are true to your claim that there is no Day of Judgment
  56,87,why can you not bring it (the soul) back (to life)
  56,88,(If a dying soul) is of those near to God
  56,89,"it will have rest, happiness, and a beautiful Paradise"
  56,90,If it is of the people of the right hand
  56,91,"it will be with the people of the right hand, living in peace and security"
  56,92,If it is of those who have rejected the Truth and have gone astray
  56,93,its dwelling will be boiling water
  56,94,and the heat of hell fire
  56,95,This is the absolute Truth and certainty
  56,96,"So glorify the name of your Lord, the Great One"
  57,1,All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify God. He is Majestic and All-wise
  57,2,To Him belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes things to die. He has power over all things
  57,3,"He is the First, the Last, the Manifest, and the Unseen and He knows all things"
