quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,170,"When some people are asked to follow the revelations of God, they say, \"We would rather follow what our fathers have followed,\" even though their fathers had no understanding and could not find the true guidance"
  2,171,"Preaching to unbelievers is like talking to someone who cannot hear anything except yells and shouts. They are deaf, dumb, and blind; they have no understanding"
  2,172,"Believers, eat from the good things that We have given you and give thanks to God if you worship only Him"
  2,173,"God has forbidden you to eat that which has not been properly slaughtered, blood, pork, and the flesh of any animal which has not been consecrated with a mention of the Name of God. However, in an emergency, without the intention of transgression or repeating transgression, one will not be considered to have committed a sin. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful"
  2,174,"Those who receive some small gain by hiding the Books which God has revealed, have, in fact, filled up their stomachs with fire. God will not speak with them on the Day of Judgment, nor will He purify them; instead, they will face a painful torment"
  2,175,They have exchanged guidance for error and forgiveness for torment. What makes them seek the fire so earnestly (for they are doomed to be punished)
  2,176,God has revealed the Book in all Truth and those who dispute it are filled with malice which has taken them far away from the truth
