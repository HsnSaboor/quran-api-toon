quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  39,57,"Or before the soul says, \"Had God guided me, I could have been a pious man"
  39,58,"Or, on seeing the torment, it would say, \"Would I have the opportunity, this time I would certainly become a pious person"
  39,59,"God will reply to the soul, \"My revelations had certainly come to you but you rejected them. You were puffed-up with pride and you became an unbeliever"
  39,60,On the Day of Judgment you will see the faces of those who had invented falsehood against God blackened. Is not hell the dwelling of the arrogant ones
  39,61,God will save the pious ones because of their virtuous deeds. No hardship will touch them nor will they be grieved
  39,62,God is the Creator and Guardian of all things
  39,63,In His hands are the keys of the treasuries of the heavens and the earth. Those who reject God's revelations will be lost
  39,64,"(Muhammad), say, \"Ignorant ones, do you command me to worship things other than God"
  39,65,"even though God has said, \"It has been revealed to you and to those who lived before you that if you consider other things equal to God, your deeds will be made devoid of all virtue and you will certainly be lost"
  39,66,"(Muhammad), You must worship God alone and give Him thanks"
  39,67,They have not paid due respect to God. The whole earth will be gripped in His hands on the Day of Judgment and the heavens will be just like a scroll in His right hand. God is too Glorious and High to be considered equal to their idols
