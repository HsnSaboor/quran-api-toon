quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,"However, (the disbelievers) prefer the worldly life"
  87,17,even though the life hereafter will be better and will last forever
  87,18,This is what is written in the ancient heavenly Books
  87,19,the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Have you heard the story of the overwhelming event (the Day of Judgment)
  88,2,On that day the faces of some people will be humbly cast down
  88,3,troubled and tired as a result of their deeds in the past
  88,4,They will suffer the heat of the blazing fire
  88,5,and will be made to drink from a fiercely boiling spring
  88,6,They will have no food other than bitter and thorny fruit
  88,7,which will neither fatten them nor satisfy them
  88,8,"However, on that day the faces of other people will be happy"
  88,9,and pleased with the result of their deeds in the past
  88,10,They will live in an exalted garden
  88,11,wherein they will not hear any vain talk
  88,12,Therein will be a flowing spring
  88,13,raised couches
  88,14,well arranged goblets
  88,15,well-placed cushions
  88,16,and well spread carpets
  88,17,Have they not looked at how the camel is created
  88,18,how the heavens are raised up high
  88,19,how the mountains are set firm
  88,20,and how the earth is spread out
  88,21,"(Muhammad), preach; you are only a preacher"
  88,22,You do not have full control over them
  88,23,"However, those who turn away and disbelieve"
  88,24,God will punish them with the greatest torment
  88,25,To Us they will all return
  88,26,In Our hands are their accounts
