quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,119,"Why should you not eat such flesh when God has told you in detail what is unlawful to eat under normal conditions. Most people, out of ignorance, are led astray by their desires. Your Lord knows best those who transgress"
  6,120,Stay away from both public and secret sins for a sinner will suffer for whatever he has committed
  6,121,"Do not eat the flesh of an animal which has been slaughtered without a mention of the Name of God; it is a sinful deed. Satan teaches his friends to argue with you. If you obey them, you will certainly be idol worshippers"
  6,122,"Can the dead to whom We have given life and light so that they may walk among the people, be considered equal to those who can never come out of darkness? The deeds of the unbelievers are made to seem attractive to them"
  6,123,In every town We have placed some sinful leaders who always make evil plans. These plans will only work against their own souls but they do not realize this
  6,124,"When a miracle is shown to them, they say, \"We will not believe unless we are shown a miracle like that shown to the messengers of God.\" God knows best whom to appoint as His Messenger. The sinful ones are worthless in the sight of God and they deserve a severe punishment for their evil plans"
