quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,71,"(Muhammad), ask them, \"Think, if God were to cause the night to continue until the Day of Judgment which Lord besides Him could bring you light? Will you then not listen to (His revelations)"
  28,72,"Say, \"Do you not think that if God were to cause the day to continue until the Day of Judgment, which Lord besides Him could bring you the night to rest. Do you not see (His signs)"
  28,73,He has made the night and day for you to rest as a mercy to you and seek His favor and that perhaps you will give Him thanks
  28,74,"God will call the unbelievers on the Day of Judgment and ask them, \"Where are your idols in which you had faith"
  28,75,We shall call from every nation a witness and shall ask them to bring proof (in support of their belief). They will know that truth belongs to God and that whatever they had falsely invented has abandoned them
  28,76,"Korah was a man from the people of Moses. This man rebelled against them. We had given him so much treasure that the keys of the stores of his treasures could hardly even be carried by a group of strong people. His people told him, \"Do not be proud of your wealth; God does not love those who are proudly happy of their wealth"
  28,77,Seek the gains of the life to come through your wealth without ignoring your share of this life. Do favors to others just as God has done favors to you. Do not commit evil in the land for God does not love the evil-doers
