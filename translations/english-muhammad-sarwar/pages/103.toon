  4,156,"Their hearts were also sealed because of their lack of faith, their gravely slanderous accusation against Mary"
  4,157,"and their statement that they murdered Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of God, when, in fact, they could not have murdered him or crucified him.

They all will receive a great reward from Us"
