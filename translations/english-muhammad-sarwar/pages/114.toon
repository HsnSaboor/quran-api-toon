quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,37,They will wish to get out of the fire but they will not have such a choice. Their torment will be constant
  5,38,Cut off the hands of a male or female thief as a punishment for their deed and a lesson for them from God. God is Majestic and All-wise
  5,39,"However, God will accept the repentance of whoever repents and reforms himself after committing injustice; He is All-forgiving and All-merciful"
  5,40,Do you not know that to God belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and that He punishes or forgives whomever He wants? God has power over all things
  5,41,"Messenger, do not be grieved about the people who run back to disbelief. They only say that they believe but, in fact, they have no faith in their hearts. Some Jews knowingly listen to lies and accept the lies which come from others, (Jews), who have no relation with you and who distort certain words of the Bible and say to the people, \"Accept only those words which are the same as what We have told you. If you do not, then beware!\" You can not help those whom God wants to try. God does not want to cleanse the hearts of such people. They lead a disgraceful life in this world and in the life hereafter they will suffer a great torment"
