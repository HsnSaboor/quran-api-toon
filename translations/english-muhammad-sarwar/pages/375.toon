quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,184,Have fear of the One who has created you and the generations that lived before you
  26,185,"They said, \"You are no more than a bewitched and insane man"
  26,186,and a mere mortal like us. We think you are a liar
  26,187,Let a part of the sky fall on us if what you say is true
  26,188,"He said, \"My Lord knows all that you do"
  26,189,They rejected him and then the torment of the gloomy day struck them. It was certainly a great torment
  26,190,"In this there is an evidence of the Truth, but many of them did not have any faith"
  26,191,Your Lord is Majestic and All-merciful
  26,192,"This, (Quran), is certainly the revelation from the Lord of the Universe"
  26,193,It has been revealed through the trustworthy Spirit
  26,194,"to your heart, so that you will warn (the people of the dangers of disobeying God)"
  26,195,It has been revealed in plain Arabic
  26,196,Its news was also mentioned in the ancient Books
  26,197,Is not the fact (that the Israelite scholars already knew about the Quran through their Book) sufficient evidence for the pagans of the truthfulness (of the Quran)
  26,198,Had We revealed it to a non-Arab
  26,199,"who would have read it to them, they (pagans) would not have believed in it"
  26,200,Thus it passes through the hearts of the criminals
  26,201,They will not believe in it until they suffer the painful torment
  26,202,The torment will strike them suddenly without their knowledge
  26,203,"They will say, \"Can we be granted any respite"
  26,204,Do they want to hasten Our torment
  26,205,Do you not see that even if We give them respite for years
  26,206,and then Our torment will strike them
