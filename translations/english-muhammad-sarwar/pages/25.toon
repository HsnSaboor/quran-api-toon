quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,164,"The creation of the heavens and the earth, the alternation of nights and days, the ships that sail in the sea for the benefit of the people, the water that God sends from the sky to revive the dead earth where He has scattered all kinds of animals, the winds of all directions, and the clouds rendered for service between the sky and the earth are all evidence (of His existence) for those who use their reason"
  2,165,"Some people consider certain things equal to God and love them just as one should love God. However, the strongest of the believers' love is their love of God. Had the unjust been able to reflect about their condition, when facing the torment, they would have had no doubt that to God belongs All-power and that He is stern in His retribution"
  2,166,"When the leaders see the torment and lose all their resources, they will denounce their followers"
  2,167,"The followers will say, \"Had we had the chance we also would have denounced our leaders.\" That is how God will show them their regrettable deeds. They will not be able to escape from hell fire"
  2,168,"People, eat of the good and lawful things on earth. Do not follow the footsteps of Satan; he is clearly your enemy"
  2,169,He tries to make you do evil and shameful things and speak against God without knowledge
