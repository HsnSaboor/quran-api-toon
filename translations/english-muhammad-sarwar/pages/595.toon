  91,1,By the sun and its noon-time brightness
  91,2,by the moon when it follows the sun
  91,3,by the day when it brightens the earth
  91,4,by the night when it covers the earth with darkness
  91,5,by the heavens and that (Power) which established them
  91,6,by the earth and that (Power) which spread it out
  91,7,and by the soul and that (Power) which designed it
  91,8,and inspired it with knowledge of evil and piety
  91,9,those who purify their souls will certainly have everlasting happiness
  91,10,and those who corrupt their souls will certainly be deprived (of happiness)
