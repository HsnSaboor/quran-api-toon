quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  28,60,"Whatever you (people) have been given are only the means for enjoyment and beauty of the worldly life, but the means of enjoyment (which you will receive from God) in the life to come will be better and everlasting. Will you then not take heed"
  28,61,Is the case of those to whom We have promised good things - which they will certainly receive in the life to come - equal to the case of those to whom We have granted the means of enjoyment in the worldly life and who will certainly be questioned about them in the life to come
  28,62,"On the day when He will ask (the latter group), \"Where are those whom you had considered equal to Me"
  28,63,"Those who have become subject to punishment will say, \"Lord, they seduced us.\" Their idols will say, \"We seduced them but we renounce their worshipping us for it was not us whom they worshipped"
  28,64,They will be told to call their idols. They will call them but will receive no answer. They will see the torment approaching and wish that they had sought guidance
  28,65,"On the day when God will call them and ask them, \"What answer did you give to (Our) messengers"
  28,66,The door to all answers will be closed to them and they will not even be able to ask one another
  28,67,"However, those who have repented and have become righteously striving believers will perhaps have everlasting happiness"
  28,68,Your Lord creates and chooses (to grant mercy) to whomever He wants. (In matters of guidance) they (unbelievers) do not have the choice to choose whatever they want. God is too exalted to be considered equal to anything else
  28,69,Your Lord knows all that their hearts hide or reveal
  28,70,He is the only God and it is only He who deserves to be given thanks in this world and in the life to come. Judgment is in His hands and to Him you will all return
