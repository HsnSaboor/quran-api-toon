quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,92,You can never have extended virtue and righteousness unless you spend part of what you dearly love for the cause of God. God knows very well whatever you spend for His cause
  3,93,"All food was lawful for the children of Israel except for what Israel had deemed unlawful for himself before the Torah was revealed. (Muhammad), ask them to bring the Torah and read it, if they are true in their claim (that all food was not unlawful for the children of Israel)"
  3,94,Whoever ascribes falsehood to God despite of all the evidence is unjust
  3,95,"(Muhammad), say, \"God has spoken the Truth. Follow the upright tradition of Abraham who was not an idolater"
  3,96,The first house (of worship) that God assigned to men was in Bakka (another name of Mecca). It is a blessed one and a guide for all people
  3,97,"In (Bakka), there are many clear signs (evidence of the existence of God). Among them is the spot where Abraham stood. Whoever seeks refuge therein will be protected by the laws of amnesty. Those who have the means and ability have a duty to God to visit the House and perform the hajj (pilgrimage) rituals. The unbelievers should know that God is Independent of all creatures"
  3,98,"(Muhammad), ask the People of the Book, \"Why do you deny the revelations of God when He is Well-Aware of your dealings"
  3,99,"Ask them, \"Why do you create obstacles in the way of God for those who believe in Him, trying to make His way seem crooked when you know that it is straight? God is not unaware of what you do"
  3,100,"Believers, if you obey a certain group among the People of the Book, they will turn you back to disbelief"
