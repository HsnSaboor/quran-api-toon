quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  21,36,"(Muhammad), whenever the unbelievers see you, they think that you deserve nothing more than to be mocked. They say, \"Is it he, (Muhammad), who speaks against your gods?\" But they themselves have no faith at all in the Beneficent God"
  21,37,"The human being is created hasty. Tell them, \"Do not be hasty, for God will soon show you the evidence of His existence"
  21,38,"They say, \"When shall the Day of Judgment come to pass if you are true in your claim"
  21,39,"Would that the unbelievers knew that no one would protect their faces and backs against the fire, nor they would be helped"
  21,40,"The fire will suddenly strike and confound them. They will not be able to repel it, nor will they be given any respite"
  21,41,"They mocked the Messengers who were sent before you; thus, the torment which they had ridiculed encompassed them all"
  21,42,"Ask them, \"Who can protect them from (the wrath of) the Beneficent God during the night and day?\" Yet they are neglectful about their Lord"
  21,43,"Can their gods protect them against Us? Their gods have no power even to help themselves, nor are they safe from Our retribution"
  21,44,We have been providing these men and their fathers with the means of enjoyment for a long time. Have they not ever considered that We populated the earth and then caused many of the inhabitants to pass away? Can they have any success (in their wickedness)
