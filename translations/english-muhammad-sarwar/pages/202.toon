quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  9,94,"They will apologize to you on your return. Tell them, \"Do not ask for pardon. We will never believe you. God has already told us everything about you. God and His Messenger will soon make your deeds public, then you will return to Him who has absolute knowledge of the unseen and the seen and He will inform you of what you have done"
  9,95,When you return they will appeal to you in the Name of God to leave them alone. So leave them alone. They are filthy and their dwelling will be hell as a recompense for what they had gained
  9,96,"They swear in the Name of God to please you. Even if you were to be pleased with them, God is not pleased with evil-doing people"
  9,97,The desert dwelling Arabs are far worse than the others in their disbelief and hypocrisy and have more reason to be ignorant of the revelations that God revealed to His Messenger. God is All-knowing and All-wise
  9,98,"Whatever some of the desert dwelling Arabs spend for the cause of God, they consider it a loss to themselves. They wish to see you in trouble. Trouble has struck them already. God is All-hearing and All-knowing"
  9,99,"Some of the desert dwelling Arabs believe in God and the Day of Judgment. Whatever they spend for the cause of God they consider it as a means of getting nearer to God and have the prayers of the Messenger in their favor. This, certainly is a means to get nearer to God. God will admit them into His mercy. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful"
