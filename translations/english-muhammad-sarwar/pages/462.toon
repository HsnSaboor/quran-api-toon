quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  39,32,Who is more unjust then one who invents falsehood against God and rejects the truth after it has come to them. Is not hell a dwelling for the disbelievers
  39,33,Those who have brought the truth and have acknowledged it are those who have fear of God
  39,34,They will receive whatever they want from their Lord. Thus is the reward of the righteous ones
  39,35,God will certainly expiate their bad deeds and reward them much more for what they have done
  39,36,Is God not sufficient (support) for His servants? They frighten you with what they worship besides God. Who can guide one whom God has caused to go astray
  39,37,Who can mislead one whom God has guided? Is God not Majestic and Revengeful
  39,38,"If you ask them, \"Who has created the heavens and the earth?\" They will certainly say, \"God has created them.\" Ask them, \"Do you think that you can rescue me from the punishment of God with which He may afflict me? Can you prevent His mercy if He wants to grant it to me?\" Say, \"God is Sufficient (support) for me. In Him alone one must trust"
  39,39,"Say, \"My people, act as you wish. I shall do as I like and you will soon know"
  39,40,who will face the humiliating torment and suffer everlasting retribution
