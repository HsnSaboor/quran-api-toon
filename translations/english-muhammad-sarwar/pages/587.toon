quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When the heavens are rent asunder
  82,2,the stars are dispersed
  82,3,the oceans are merged together
  82,4,and the graves are turned inside out
  82,5,every soul will see the result of its deeds - those recorded before his death and those which will produce either virtue or evil after his death
  82,6,"Human being, what evil has deceived you about your Gracious Lord"
  82,7,Who created you proportionately and fashioned you
  82,8,in whatever composition He wanted
  82,9,"Despite this, you deny the Day of Judgment"
  82,10,but you should know that there are angelic guards
  82,11,watching over you
  82,12,and these honorable scribes know whatever you do
  82,13,The virtuous ones will live in bliss
  82,14,and the evil-doers will be in hell
  82,15,which they will enter on the Day of Judgment
  82,16,to burn therein
  82,17,They will never be able to escape from it. Would that you knew what the Day of Judgment is
  82,18,Again would that you only knew how terrible it really is
  82,19,"On that day, no soul will be of any benefit to any other soul. On that day, all affairs will be in the hands of God"
  83,1,Woe to those who are fraudulent in (weighing and measuring)
  83,2,those who demand a full measure from others
  83,3,"but when they measure or weigh, give less"
  83,4,Do they not realize that they will be resurrected
  83,5,on a great day
  83,6,when mankind will stand before the Lord of the Universe
