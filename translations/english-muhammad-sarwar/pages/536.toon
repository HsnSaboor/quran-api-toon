quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  56,51,Then you people who had gone astray and rejected the Truth
  56,52,will eat from the fruit of the tree of Zaqqum
  56,53,"filling your bellies, with it"
  56,54,and on top of this you will drink boiling water
  56,55,like a thirsty camel
  56,56,Such will be their dwelling on the Day of Judgment
  56,57,It is We who have created you. Why then did you not testify to the Truth
  56,58,Have you seen sperm
  56,59,Did you create it or was it We who created it
  56,60,We have destined death for you and no one can challenge Us
  56,61,"in replacing you with another creation like you, changing you into a form which you do not know"
  56,62,You certainly knew about (your) first development. Why do you not take heed
  56,63,Have you seen what you sow
  56,64,Do you make it grow or is it We who make it grow
  56,65,"Had We wanted, We could have crushed it to bits and you would have been left to lament"
  56,66,"crying, \"We have been left to suffer loss"
  56,67,"Surely, we have been deprived (of the benefits)"
  56,68,Have you seen the water which you drink
  56,69,Is it you who sent it down from the clouds or is it We who have sent it down
  56,70,"Had We wanted, We could have made it salty. Why then do you not give thanks"
  56,71,Have you seen the fire which you kindle
  56,72,Is it you who have produced its tree or is it We who have produced it
  56,73,It is We who have made it as a reminder and a means of comfort for the people
  56,74,"(Muhammad), glorify your Lord, the Great One"
  56,75,I do not need to swear by the setting of the stars
  56,76,which is indeed a great oath if only you knew it
