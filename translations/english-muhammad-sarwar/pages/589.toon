quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,while reclining on couches and reviewing (the bounties given to them)
  83,36,Will not the disbelievers then be duly recompensed for their laughing at the believers
  84,1,When the heavens are rent asunder
  84,2,in obedience to the commands of their Lord which are incumbent on them
  84,3,when the earth is stretched out
  84,4,and throws out of itself all that it contains
  84,5,"in obedience to the commands of its Lord which are incumbent on it, (the human being will receive due recompense for his deeds)"
  84,6,"Human being, you strive hard to get closer to your Lord, and so you will certainly receive the recompense (of your deeds)"
  84,7,The reckoning of those whose Book of records will be given into their right hands
  84,8,will be easy
  84,9,"and they will return to their people, delighted"
  84,10,But as for those whose Book of records will be given behind their backs
  84,11,"they will say, \"Woe to us"
  84,12,They will suffer the heat of hell fire
  84,13,They lived among their people joyfully
  84,14,and had thought that they would never be brought back to life again
  84,15,This is a fact. Their Lord is Well-Aware of (all that they do)
  84,16,I do not need to swear by the sunset
  84,17,or by the night in which things all come together to rest
  84,18,or by the moon when it is full
  84,19,that you will certainly pass through one stage after another
  84,20,What is the matter with them? Why do they not believe
  84,21,"Why, when the Quran is recited to them, do they not prostrate themselves"
  84,22,"In fact, they reject the Quran"
  84,23,but God knows best whatever they accumulate in their hearts
  84,24,"(Muhammad), tell them that they will all suffer a painful torment"
  84,25,"except the righteously striving believers, who will receive a never-ending reward"
