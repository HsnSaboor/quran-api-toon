quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  33,7,"We had a solemn covenant with you (Muhammad), and the Prophets: Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, the son of Mary"
  33,8,This was a firm agreement. God will ask the truthful ones about their truthfulness and prepare a painful torment for the disbelievers
  33,9,"Believers, recall God's favor to you when the army attacked you. We sent a wind and the armies, which you did not see, to support you. God sees all that you do"
  33,10,Eyes became dull and hearts almost reached the throat when they attacked you from above and below and you started to think of God with suspicion
  33,11,There the believers were tested and tremendously shaken
  33,12,"It was there that the hypocrites and those whose hearts were sick, said, \"The promise of God and His Messenger has proved to be nothing but deceit"
  33,13,"It was there that a group of them said, \"People of Yathrib, turn back for there is no place for you to stay.\" Another group, asking for the Prophet's permission, said, \"Our homes are defenseless.\" In fact, they were not defenseless. They only wanted to run away"
  33,14,"Had the army of the enemies invaded their homes and asked them to give-up their religion, they would have yielded to them without delay"
  33,15,They had certainly promised God that they would not turn away. To promise God is certainly a (great) responsibility
