quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,How could you turn back to disbelief when the words of God are recited to you and you have in your midst His Messenger? Those who seek the protection of God will certainly be guided to the right path
  3,102,"Believers, have fear of God as you should and die only as Muslims (having submitted to the will of God)"
  3,103,"All of you united hold fast to the rope of God (the Quran and His Messenger), and recall how He favored you when your hostility to each other had torn you apart. He united your hearts in one faith and through His Grace you became brothers. You were on the verge of falling headlong into the abyss of fire, but God saved you. This is how God explains to you His revelations so that you may have the right guidance"
  3,104,"Let there be a group among you who will invite others to do good deeds, command them to obey the Law, and prohibit them from committing sins. These people will have eternal happiness"
  3,105,Do not be like those who turned into quarrelling sects after receiving clear authoritative evidence. They will suffer a great torment
  3,106,"On the day when some faces will become white and others black, God will ask the people with the faces which have become black, \"Why did you give up your faith? Now suffer the torment for your disbelief"
  3,107,The people whose faces have become white will enjoy the mercy of God with which they will live forever
  3,108,"Such are God's revelations which We explain to you, (Muhammad), for a genuine purpose. God does not want injustice for any of His creatures"
