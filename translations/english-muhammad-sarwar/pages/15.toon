  2,99,(Muhammad) We have given you enlightening authority. Only the wicked sinners deny it
  2,100,"Why is it that every time they (the Jews) make a covenant, some of them abandon it. Most of them do not even believe"
  2,101,"When a Messenger of God came to them confirming the (original) revelation that they already had received, a group of those who had the Scripture with them, threw the Book of God behind their backs as if they did not know anything about it"
