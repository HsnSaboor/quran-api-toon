  3,78,"A group among the People of the Book when reading the Bible, deliberately mispronounce words in order to change their meaning, try to show that what they have read is from the true Bible. In fact, what they have read is not from the true Bible. They say, \"What we read is from God.\" In reality, it is not from God. They knowingly ascribe false statements to God"
  3,79,"God would never give the Book, authority, or prophesy to any person who would tell others to be his servants instead of being the servants of God. He would rather tell them to worship God for they had been teaching and studying the Book"

  3,82,"After this, whoever turns away will be of the evil-doers"
  3,83,"Do they want a religion other than the religion of God when all that is in the heavens and the earth have submitted themselves to His will, either by their own free will or by force? To God do all things return"
