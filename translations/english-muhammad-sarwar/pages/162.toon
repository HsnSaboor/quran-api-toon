quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,88,"A proud group among Shu'ayb's people said, \"We must expel you (Shu'ayb) and your followers from our town unless you give-up your faith and live as our own people.\" Shu'ayb asked them, \"Will you use force against us"
  7,89,"We would certainly be inventing falsehoods against God if we were to accept your way of life, when God has already saved us from it. We do not have to accept it unless God, our Lord, wills it. Our Lord's knowledge covers all things. We trust in Him and ask Him to judge among us and our people, for He is the best Judge"
  7,90,"A group of the unbelievers among his people told the others, \"If you follow Shu'ayb, you will certainly lose a great deal"
  7,91,"Suddenly, an earthquake struck them and left them motionless in their homes"
  7,92,Those who called Shu'ayb a liar were destroyed as though they never existed. They certainly were the ones to lose a great deal
  7,93,"He turned away from them saying, \"My people, I preached the Message of my Lord to you and gave you good advice. How could I be sorry for the unbelievers"
  7,94,"To every town that We sent a Prophet, We tested its inhabitants through distress and adversity so that perhaps they would submit themselves to Us"
  7,95,"We then replaced their misfortune with well-being until they were relieved and began saying, \"Our fathers had also experienced good and bad days.\" Suddenly, We struck them (with torment) while they were all unaware (of what was happening)"
