quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,16,"(Such will be the reward of) those who say, \"Lord, we have believed in you. Forgive us our sins and save us from the torment of fire"
  3,17,"who exercise patience, speak the truth, who are devoted in prayer, spend their property for the cause of God and seek forgiveness from God during the last part of the night"
  3,18,"God Himself testifies that He is the only Lord. The angels and the men of knowledge and justice testify that God is the only Lord, the Majestic, and All-wise"
  3,19,"In the sight of God Islam is the religion. The People of the Book created differences in the matters (of religion) because of their hostility among themselves, only after knowledge had come to them. Let whoever denies the revelations of God know that the reckoning of God is swift"
  3,20,"(Muhammad), if the People of the Book argue against you, say, \"I and those who follow me have submitted ourselves to God.\" Ask the People of the Book and the illiterate ones, \"Have you embraced Islam?\" If they embrace Islam, they will find guidance but if they turn away, your task is just to preach. God knows all about His servants"
  3,21,"Warn those who deny the revelations of God and unjustly slay the Prophets and those who call people to be just, that they will suffer a painful torment"
  3,22,The deeds of such people are made devoid of all virtue in both this life and the life to come. There will be no one to help them
