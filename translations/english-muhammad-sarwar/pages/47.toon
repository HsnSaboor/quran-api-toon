quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,Those who take unlawful interest will stand before God (on the Day of Judgment) as those who suffer from a mental imbalance because of Satan's touch; they have said that trade is just like unlawful interest. God has made trade lawful and has forbidden unlawful interest. One who has received advice from his Lord and has stopped committing sins will be rewarded for his previous good deeds. His affairs will be in the hands of God. But one who turns back to committing sins will be of the dwellers of hell wherein he will live forever
  2,276,God makes unlawful interest devoid of all blessings and causes charity to increase. God does not love sinful unbelievers
  2,277,"The righteously striving believers who are steadfast in their prayers and pay the zakat, will receive their reward from God. They will have no fear nor will they grieve"
  2,278,"Believers, have fear of God and give up whatever unlawful interest you still demand from others, if you are indeed true believers"
  2,279,"If you will not give up the unlawful interest which you demand, know that you are in the state of war with God and His Messenger. But if you repent, you will have your capital without being wronged or having done wrong to others"
  2,280,One who faces hardship in paying his debts must be given time until his financial condition improves. Would that you knew that waiving such a loan as charity would be better for you
  2,281,Safeguard yourselves against the day when you will return to God and every soul will be rewarded according to its deeds without being wronged
