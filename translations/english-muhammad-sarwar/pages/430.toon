quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,15,"There was evidence (of the truth) for the people of Sheba in their homeland. (We gave them) two gardens, one on the left and one on the right and (told them), \"Consume the sustenance which your Lord has given to you and give Him thanks. You have a blessed land and an All-forgiving Lord"
  34,16,"They ignored (the evidence) and We sent to them a flood, arising from a broken dam. Nothing was left in their gardens but bitter fruits, some tamarisk and a few lotus trees"
  34,17,This was how We recompensed them for their ungratefulness and thus do We recompense the ungrateful ones
  34,18,"We established between them and the town that We had blessed, other towns nearby, and thus made it easier to travel. We told them, \"Travel there safely day and night"
  34,19,"They said, \"Lord, make the distances of our journeys longer.\" They did injustice to themselves and We turned their existence into ancient tales by making them disintegrate totally. In this there is evidence (of the truth) for every forbearing and grateful person"
  34,20,Iblis (satan) made his judgment about them to come true. They all followed them except a believing group among them
  34,21,He did not have any authority over them except to the extent that would allow Us to know who had faith in the life to come and who had doubts about it. Your Lord is a Guard over all things
  34,22,"Say, (Muhammad), \"Ask help from those whom you worship besides God. They do not possess an atom's weight in the heavens and the earth, have no share therein, nor will any of their idols be able to support them"
