quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,1,"Only God Who has created the heavens, the earth, darkness, and light deserves all praise. The disbelievers consider other things equal to Him"
  6,2,It is He who has created you from clay to live for a life-time and the span of your life is only known to Him. You are still suspicious
  6,3,"He is God of the heavens and the earth and He knows whatever you conceal, reveal, or gain"
  6,4,(The unbelievers) have always turned away from the revelations and the evidence (of the Truth) that has been sent to them from time to time
  6,5,They have refused the Truth (Muhammad's message) that has come to them but they will soon learn the consequences of their mocking
  6,6,"Why do they not consider how many generations living before them We have destroyed. We established those nations in the land with abilities far beyond those given to you. We sent down plenty of rain from the sky for them and made streams flow therein, but, then, We destroyed them for their sins and established other nations after them"
  6,7,"(Muhammad), had We sent you a Book on paper, the unbelievers would have touched it with their hands but would still have said, \"It is no more than plain sorcery"
  6,8,"They have said, \"Why has not an angel come to him (Muhammad)?\" Had We sent an angel to them, the matter would have inevitably been out of their hands, and they would have been given no more time"
