quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  10,79,"And Firawn said, “Bring to me every learned magician.”"
  10,80,"So when the magicians came, Musa said to them, “Put down that which you are to put down.”"
  10,81,"So when they had put down (and exhibited their magic), Musa said, “What you have come with is magic, Allah will certainly falsify it, Allah certainly does not set right the work of those who are corrupt"
  10,82,and Allah confirms the truth by His words though the criminals may dislike.”
  10,83,"So none believed in Musa except the descendants of his people due to the fear of Firawn and their leaders, lest he should persecute them, and Firawn was certainly dominating in the earth and he was certainly of the extravagant"
  10,84,"And Musa said, “O my people ! if you believe in Allah then put your trust in Him, if you are those who submit(as Muslims).”"
  10,85,"So they said, “We put our trust in Allah; our Fosterer ! do not make us an (item of) trial for the unjust people"
  10,86,and deliver us through your mercy from a people who are infidels.”
  10,87,"And We communicated to Musa and his brother, “Settle your people in houses in Egypt and make your houses the Qibla (direction during worship) and establish worship (salat) and give good news to the believers"
  10,88,"And Musa said, “Our Fosterer ! You have given to Firawn and the leaders of his (community) adornment and wealth in the life of this world, our Fosterer ! that they may mislead people from Your way. Our Fosterer ! destroy their wealth and harden their hearts so that they do not believe till they see the painful punishment.”"
