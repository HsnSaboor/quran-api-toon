quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  57,4,"He it is Who created the skies and the earth in six periods, then He set the balance on the throne (of the universe). He knows that which enters into the earth and that which comes out of it and that which comes down from the sky and that which goes up into it. And He is with you wherever you are and Allah is the Seer of that which you do"
  57,5,"His is the kingdom of the skies and the earth, and (all) affairs will be returned to Allah"
  57,6,"He causes the night to enter into the day and He causes the day to enter into the night, and He is the Knower of what the bosoms (hearts) possess"
  57,7,"Believe in Allah and His messenger and spend from that which He has made you to be successors of. So those who believe from among you and spend, for them there is a great reward"
  57,8,"And what (reason is there) for you that you do not believe in Allah when His messenger invites you to believe in your Fosterer, and indeed He has taken a pledge from you, if you are believers"
  57,9,"He it is Who sends down clear signs on His servant, that He may bring you out from darkness towards light and Allah is certainly full of pity. Merciful to you"
  57,10,"And what (reason is there) for you, that you do not spend in the way of Allah, when Allah’s is the inheritance of the skies and the earth (that is, when everything will go back to Him)? Those among you who spent and fought before the victory (of Mecca) are not equal to, (but) are greater in rank compared to those who spent and fought after (the victory), and to each Allah has promised good, and Allah is informed of that which you do"
  57,11,Who is there who will loan to Allah a good loan so that He will double it for him and for him there will be an honourable reward
