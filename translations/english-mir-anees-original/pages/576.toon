quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,He reflected and made a programme
  74,19,"So be he killed, how he made a programme"
  74,20,"again be he killed, how he made a programme"
  74,21,Then he looked
  74,22,then he frowned and made a face
  74,23,then he turned away considering himself great
  74,24,"then said, “This is nothing but magic derived from the ancient"
  74,25,this is nothing but the statement of man.”
  74,26,I will make him enter hell
  74,27,And what will make you realize what hell is
  74,28,It does not let (anything) to remain nor does it spare
  74,29,It will burn and darken the skin (of man)
  74,30,Over it are nineteen
  74,31,"And We have not appointed the guardians of hell, other than the angels, and We have not fixed their number but for the affliction of those who do not believe. So that those who are given the book may be certain and those who believe may increase in belief and those who were given the book and the believers may not be doubtful. And those in whose hearts is a disease and the infidels may say, “What does Allah intend by this similitude?” Thus Allah leaves to stray whom He wills and He guides whom He wills and no one knows the forces of your Fosterer except He Himself and this is nothing but a reminder to man"
  74,32,"No, by the moon"
  74,33,and the night when it retreats
  74,34,and the day when it shines
  74,35,it (the news of hell) is certainly a great
  74,36,warning to man
  74,37,to him among you who wills to advance or remain behind
  74,38,Every soul is held in pledge (security) for that which it earned
  74,39,except the companions of the right hand
  74,40,"in gardens, asking each other"
  74,41,about the criminals
  74,42,“What has brought you into the hell?”
  74,43,"They will say, “We were not of those who offered worship (salat)"
  74,44,and we did not feed the poor
  74,45,and we used to involve ourselves in idle talk with those involved in idle talk
  74,46,and we used to deny the day of judgment
  74,47,till (death) which is certain came to us.”
