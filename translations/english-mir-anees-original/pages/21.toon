  2,140,"Or do you say that Ibrahim and Ismael and Ishaq and Yaqub and the tribes were Jews or Christians?\" Say, \"Do you know better or Allah?\" And who is more unjust then one who hides a testimony which he has from Allah? And Allah is not unaware of what you do"
  2,141,"That was a community which has passed away, for them is that which they earned, and for you that which you earn, and you will not be questioned about what they used to do"
