quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,6,"And there is no moving creature in the earth but (the responsibility of) its provision is on Allah, and He knows its place/time of stay and its place/time of departure, everything is in a clear record"
  11,7,"And He it is Who created the skies and the earth in six periods when His throne was on water,* that He may test you as to which of you is best in action. And if you say, “You will be raised up after death,” those who do not believe will definitely say, “This is nothing but clear magic.” * Fluid"
  11,8,"And if We postpone the punishment from them for a measured period of time, they will definitely say, “What stops it? Beware ! the day it will come on them, nothing will turn it away from them and that which they used to mock at will surround them"
  11,9,"And if We make man taste mercy from Us then take it off from him, he certainly becomes despairing, ungrateful"
  11,10,"And if We make him taste happiness after the harm that afflicted him, he definitely says, “Evils have gone away from me,” and he is exultant, boastful"
  11,11,except those who are patient and do righteous works; those are the persons for whom there is protective forgiveness and a great reward
  11,12,"Then it may be that you will give up part of that which is communicated to you, and your bosom will become straitened by it, because they say, “Why has not a treasure been sent down on him or an angel come with him?” You are only a warner while Allah is the Trustee over everything"
