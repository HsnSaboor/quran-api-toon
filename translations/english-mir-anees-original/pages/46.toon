  2,270,"And whatever expenditure you spend or vow* you vow, then Allah certainly knows about it, and for the unjust there are no helpers. * An oath made to Allah or to some deity, to perform some act on the fulfillment of certain conditions"
  2,271,"If you give charity openly then that is good, and if you hide it and give it to the poor then that is better for you, and this will wipe off (some) of your evil (deeds), and Allah is informed of what you do"
  2,272,"It is not your (responsibility) to guide them, but Allah guides whom He wills. And whatever you spend of good, then (the benefit of) it is for yourselves; and do not spend but to seek the Attention of Allah, and whatever you spend of good it will be repaid to you in full and injustice will not be done to you"
  2,273,"(Charity is) for the poor who are confined in the way of Allah, they cannot travel in the land, the ignorant person considers them to be free of want because of (their) abstaining (from begging), you can recognise them from their marks, they do not beg from people, being troublesome by demanding frequently; and whatever you spend of good, then Allah is certainly the Knower of it"
  2,274,"Those who spend their wealth by night and day secretly and publicly, then for them, their reward is there with their Fosterer, and there will neither be any fear on them nor will they grieve"
