quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  13,19,"Then, is he who knows, that what is sent down to you from your Fosterer is the truth, like him who is blind? Only men of understanding will mind"
  13,20,those who fulfill the agreement with Allah and do not break the pledge
  13,21,and those who join that which Allah has commanded to be joined and fear their Fosterer and are afraid of an evil accountability
  13,22,"and those who are patient seeking the Attention of their Fosterer and establish worship (salat) and spend from that which We have provided them, secretly and publicly and turn off evil with good. For such persons there will be the final (good) home"
  13,23,gardens of ever lasting bliss which they will enter along with those who were righteous from among their parents (forefathers) and their spouses and their descendants. And the angels will enter on them from every gate (saying)
  13,24,"“Peace be on you because of your patience,” so (for them is) happiness of the final (good) home"
  13,25,"And those who break the agreement of Allah after having pledged it, and cut off that which Allah has commanded that it should be joined, and cause corruption in the earth, for such persons there will be the curse and for them will be the evil home"
  13,26,"Allah enlarges the provision for whom He wills and straitens (it for whomever and whenever He wills). And they are happy with the life of this world and the life of this world, compared to the hereafter, is nothing but (temporary) enjoyment"
  13,27,"And those who do not believe say, “Why is not a sign sent down on him from his Fosterer?” Say, “Allah certainly leaves in error whom He wills and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him)"
  13,28,those who believe and whose hearts find peace in the remembrance of Allah. Beware! hearts do find peace in the remembrance of Allah
