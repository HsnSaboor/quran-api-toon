  23,90,No ! We have brought to them the truth but they are certainly liars
  23,91,"Allah has not taken any son nor is there any (other) god with Him, (had there been two or more gods, then) in that case, each god would have taken away that which he had created and some would have dominated over others, glorified be Allah above that which they describe"
  23,92,Knower of the unseen and the seen and He is Highly Exalted above that which they associate as partners (with Him)
  23,93,"Say, \"My Fosterer! if you show me that which they are promised"
  23,94,my Fosterer! then do not make me to be among the unjust people
  23,95,And We are certainly able to show you that which We have promised them
  23,96,"Repel evil with that which is the best, We know best about that which they describe"
  23,97,"And say, \"My Fosterer! I seek Your protection from the suggestions of the devils"
  23,98,"and I seek Your protection, my Fosterer! lest they be present with me"
  23,99,"(Some people continue to do evil) until when death comes to one of them (then) he says. \"My Fosterer! send me back"
  23,100,"that I may set right in (the world, all wrongs) which I have left behind.\" By no means! It is (only) a sentence which he says. And behind them is a barrier till the day they are raised"
  23,101,Then when it will be blown into the trumpet (structure of the universe) then there will be no relationships between them on that day and (therefore) they will not (be able to) demand from one another
  23,102,"Then those whose weight (of good) is heavy, those are the successful persons"
  23,103,"And those whose weight (of good) is light, those are the persons who (have put) themselves (in) loss, they will stay in hell"
  23,104,"The fire will burn their faces, and (due to severe suffering), they will have therein, an expression of torture with their lips apart"
