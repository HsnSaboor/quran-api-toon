quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,"And how many a generation did We destroy before them, who were stronger than them in taking hold (of others), but We made them to wander (from place to place) in the lands (asking), “Is there (a place of) refuge?”"
  50,37,There is certainly a reminder in that for him who has a heart or gives ear (i.e. hears) and he is one who witnesses
  50,38,"And We created the skies and the earth and that which is between them in six periods, and weariness did not (even) touch Us"
  50,39,"So be patient over what they say, and glorify by praising your Fosterer before the rising of the sun and before its setting"
  50,40,and (during parts) of the night glorify Him and after the prostrations (of salat)
  50,41,And listen ! on the day when the announcer will announce from a near place
  50,42,"the day when they will hear the loud cry in reality, that will be the day of coming out (from the earth)"
  50,43,(It is) certainly We (Who) give life and cause to die and towards Us is the destination
  50,44,"The day the earth will split from (above) them, (they will come out) fast, that is an easy gathering together for Us"
  50,45,"We know best about that which they say, and you are not a compiler over them, therefore remind through the Quran, him who fears My threat"
  51,1,"By the scatterers, scattering"
  51,2,then those bearing heaviness
  51,3,then those moving easily
  51,4,then those distributing the affair (or command)
  51,5,that which you are promised is certainly true
  51,6,and the judgment will certainly take place
