quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  37,77,and We caused his descendants to be of those who survived
  37,78,and We left on him (the responsibility of conveying Our message) among others
  37,79,Peace on Nuh in the worlds
  37,80,Thus do We reward the doers of good
  37,81,He was certainly among Our believing servants
  37,82,Then We drowned the others
  37,83,And Ibrahim was certainly of his sect
  37,84,when he came to his Fosterer with a defect less heart
  37,85,"When he said to his father and his people, “What do you worship"
  37,86,Do you intend to worship false gods besides Allah
  37,87,So what is your guess about the Fosterer of the worlds?”
  37,88,Then he looked (with a searching) look at the stars (probably because his people worshipped the stars too and)
  37,89,"then he said, “I am certainly sick.”"
  37,90,So his people turned their backs upon him and went away
  37,91,"Then he turned towards their (false) gods and said, “Why do you not eat"
  37,92,What is (wrong) with you that you do not speak?”
  37,93,So he turned against them striking with his right hand
  37,94,Then they came hastening towards him in confrontation
  37,95,"He said, “What! do you worship that which you (yourselves) carve"
  37,96,while Allah has created you and that which you do?”
  37,97,"They said, “Build a building (furnace) for him then put him into the fire.”"
  37,98,So they intended (to lay down) a plot against him but We made them the lower most
  37,99,"And he said, “I will certainly go away (from these people) towards my Fosterer, He will guide me"
  37,100,My Fosterer! grant me from among the righteous.”
  37,101,So We conveyed to him the good news of a gentle son
  37,102,"Then when he reached (the age of) striving with him, he said, “O my son! I saw in my sleep (dream) that I am slaying you (as a sacrifice), then see, what do you consider (about it)?” He said. “O My father! do what you have been commanded (to do), if Allah wills, you will find me (to be) of the patient ones.”"
