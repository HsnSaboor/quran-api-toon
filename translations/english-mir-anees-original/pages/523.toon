quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  51,52,"Thus, there did not come to those before them any messenger but they said, “A magician or one influenced by jinn.”"
  51,53,"Do they recommend this to one another? No, they are a rebellious people"
  51,54,"So turn away from them, because you are not blameworthy"
  51,55,"And be reminding, because reminding certainly benefits the believers"
  51,56,And I did not create the jinn and mankind but (with the sole purpose) that they should serve Me
  51,57,do not intend (to get) any provision from them nor do I intend that they should feed Me
  51,58,"Allah is certainly the Provider, Possessor of power, the Strong"
  51,59,"So for those who are unjust, (their) portion will certainly be like the portion of their companions, so do not let them ask Me to hasten on (the punishment)"
  51,60,So sorrowful is the state of those who do not believe because of their day which they are threatened with
  52,1,By the mountain
  52,2,and the written book
  52,3,in open pages
  52,4,and the house that is visited
  52,5,and the elevated roof
  52,6,and the overflowing sea
  52,7,The punishment of your Fosterer will certainly be brought into effect
  52,8,there will be no one to repel it
  52,9,The day the sky will whirl (with a) whirl
  52,10,"and the mountains will pass away, passing away"
  52,11,Sorrowful will be the state on that day of those who deny
  52,12,who playfully (get involved) in idle talk
  52,13,the day they will be pushed towards the fire (with) a pushing
  52,14,"(It will be said), “This is the fire which you used to deny"
