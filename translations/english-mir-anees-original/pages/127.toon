quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,114,"Isa, the son of Maryam said, \"O Allah ! our Fosterer, send down on us a table (set with food), from the sky, that it may be a feast for us, for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from You, and provide us (with sustenance) and You are the Best of the providers"
  5,115,"Allah said, \"I will send it down to you, then whoever does not believe from among you, (even) after that, I will punish him with a punishment with which I will not punish anyone in the worlds"
  5,116,"And when Allah will say, \"O Isa, the son of Maryam ! did you say to mankind: Take me and my mother as two gods, besides Allah?\" He will say, \"Glory be to You. It does not befit me that I should say something for which I have no right (to say). Had I said it then You would have indeed known it, You know that which is in my soul (mind/heart), whereas I do not know that which is in your Soul (Mind/Heart). You are certainly a Great Knower of the unseen things"
  5,117,"did not say to them anything except that which You commanded me to (say), that : Serve Allah my Fosterer and your Fosterer, and I was a witness over them as long as I was among them, then when You took me back, You were Vigilant over them and You are a Witness over everything"
  5,118,"If You punish them they are Your servants and if You protectively forgive them, then You are certainly the Mighty, the Wise"
  5,119,"Allah will say, \"This is a day when their truth will benefit the truthful, for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow, they will stay therein for ever,\" Allah will be pleased with them and they will be pleased with Him, that's the great achievement"
  5,120,Allah's is the kingdom of the skies and the earth and that which is in them and He has power over everything
