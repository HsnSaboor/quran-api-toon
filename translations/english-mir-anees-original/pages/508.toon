quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  47,12,"Allah will certainly make those who believe and do righteous works enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, and those who do not believe, (they) enjoy themselves and eat as the cattle eat, and the fire will be their home"
  47,13,"And how many towns (were there) which were severer in strength than your town (Mecca) which sent you out, (but) We destroyed them, so there was no helper for them"
  47,14,"Then, is he, who is on a clear proof from his Fosterer, like him, to whom the evil of his deed is made fair-seeming? And they follow their desires"
  47,15,"A similitude of the garden, which is promised to those who guard (against evil): In it there are rivers of water without pollution and rivers of milk the taste of which does not change and rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers and rivers of clarified honey and therein for them are all (kinds) of fruits and protective forgiveness from their Fosterer. (Are these) like those who will stay in the fire and will be given boiling water to drink so that it cuts their bowels"
  47,16,"And among them are those who seek to hear you until when they go out from your presence, (then) they say to those who have been given knowledge, “What was it that he said just now?” Those are the persons on whose hearts Allah has set a seal and they follow their desires"
  47,17,"And those who receive guidance, He increases them in guidance and gives them (the quality of) guarding (against evil)"
  47,18,Do they wait for anything but the hour of doom that it should come on them suddenly? Then its tokens have already come. Then how will their (being) mindful (be beneficial) to them when it (actually) comes on them
  47,19,Then know that there is no god except Allah and seek protection for your sin and for the believing men and the believing women. And Allah knows your places of movement and your places of rest (homes)
