quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,11,"Those who came up with the devised falsehood are certainly a group from among you. Do not think that it is harmful for you, no, it is good for you. For every man among them, is that which he has earned of the sin, and he among them who is responsible to a greater extent (regarding devising the falsehood), for him there is a great punishment"
  24,12,"Why did the believing men and the believing women, on hearing the (devised falsehood), not have good thoughts in their souls (minds) and say, \"This is clearly a devised falsehood"
  24,13,"Why did they not come up with four witnesses over it (if they were speaking the truth)? So when they did not come with witnesses, then they are the liars before Allah"
  24,14,"And had the grace of Allah not been on you with His mercy in this world and the hereafter, a great punishment would (have afflicted you because of the talk you indulged in)"
  24,15,when you were speaking (about) it with your tongues and saying with your mouths that about which you had no knowledge and you thought it to be an easy (matter) but with Allah it was great
  24,16,"And when you heard it, why did you not say, \"It is not (suitable) for us to talk about this, glory be to You (Allah), this is a great false charge"
  24,17,"Allah admonishes you that you should never return to the like of it, if you are believers"
  24,18,"And Allah makes clear to you the signs and Allah is Knowing, Wise"
  24,19,"For those who love that indecent things should spread among those who believe, there will certainly be a painful punishment in this world and the hereafter, and Allah knows while you do not know"
  24,20,"And had the grace of Allah not been on you with His mercy, and that Allah is full of pity, Merciful, (then you would have been at a loss). (R 2, P 17 ½)"
