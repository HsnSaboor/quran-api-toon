  2,184,"(for) counted number of days, so whoever is sick among you or on a journey, then (he should fast for the missed) number of days later. And on those who can do it with hardship, is ransom, feeding a poor person. Then whosoever does (more) good willingly, it is better for him, and that you fast is better for you if you know"
  2,185,"(It was the) month of Ramazan, during which the Quran was sent down (for the) guidance of human beings, and it (contains) clear explanations of the guidance and the distinction (between right and wrong).

Allah intends ease for you and He does not intend hardship for you, and (this concession is given so) that you should complete the (required) number (of days), and that you should regard Allah Great for having guided you and that you should be grateful"
  2,186,"And when My servants ask you about Me, then I am certainly near, I respond to the prayer of one who prays"
