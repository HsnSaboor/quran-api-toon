quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star when it sets
  53,2,Your companion neither went astray nor was he misled
  53,3,nor does he speak out of (his own) desire
  53,4,"It is nothing but a communication, communicated"
  53,5,"One (Jibraeel) severe in strength, made it known to him"
  53,6,(he) possesses vigor so he sought equilibrium
  53,7,when he was on the high horizon
  53,8,Then he came near and he came down
  53,9,"and was at a distance of two bows, length or closer"
  53,10,then he communicated to His servant that which he communicated
  53,11,The heart did not lie (in communicating) what it saw
  53,12,What ! do you dispute with him as to what he saw
  53,13,And he indeed saw him (Jibraeel) in another descent
  53,14,near the farthest lote tree
  53,15,near which is the garden for staying
  53,16,when that covered the lote tree which covered
  53,17,The sight neither deviated nor exceeded the limits
  53,18,He indeed saw (some) of the greater signs of his Fosterer
  53,19,Did you (ever) see Al Lat and Al Uzza
  53,20,and Manat the third (and) the last (idol)
  53,21,What! for you the males and for Him the females
  53,22,Then that is an unfair division
  53,23,"They are nothing but names which you have named, you and your fathers, for which Allah has not sent down any authority. They follow nothing but conjecture and that which their souls desire, though the guidance has come to them from their Fosterer"
  53,24,"Or, shall man have what (all) he desires"
  53,25,But Allah’s is the hereafter (future) and the former (past)
  53,26,"And how many an angel is there in the skies, whose recommendation will be of no use in anything, except after Allah gives permission to whom He wills and pleases"
