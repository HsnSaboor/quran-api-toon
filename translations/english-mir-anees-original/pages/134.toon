quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,53,"And thus do We test some of them through others, so that they say, \"Are these the persons upon whom Allah has showered His favour from among us?\" Is not Allah the Best Knower of those who are grateful"
  6,54,"And when those who believe in Our signs come to you, then say (to them), \"Peace be on you, your Fosterer has prescribed mercy on Himself, so if anyone of you did evil in ignorance then repented after that and amended, then He is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
  6,55,And thus do We explain the signs that the way of the criminals may become clear
  6,56,"Say, \"I am forbidden to serve, those whom you pray to, besides Allah,\" Say, \"I will not follow your desires, (and in case I did) then indeed I would go astray and I would not be of those who are guided"
  6,57,"Say, \"I am on a clear proof from my Fosterer, whereas you deny it. (The punishment) which you want to be hastened is not with me, the decision (to bring it about) is with none but Allah. He narrates the truth and He is the Best of judges"
  6,58,"Say, \"Had (the punishment) which you want to be hastened been with me, then the affair between me and you would have been decided, and Allah knows best those who are unjust"
  6,59,"And with Him are the keys of the unseen, no one knows it but He. And He knows that which is in the land and the sea, and there does not fall a leaf but He knows it, nor a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor anything wet nor dry, but it is (recorded) in a clear record"
