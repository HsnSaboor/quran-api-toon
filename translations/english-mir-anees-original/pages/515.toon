quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  48,29,"Muhammed is the messenger of Allah, and those with him are strong against the infidels and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing down, prostrating, seeking grace from Allah and (His) pleasure, their marks due to the effect of, prostrations are there in their faces. That is their likeness (mentioned) in the Torah and their likeness mentioned in the Injeel. (They are) like vegetation which (first) puts forth its sprout then it becomes firm then it becomes thick, then it stands balanced on its stem, pleasing the sowers, that He may make the infidels angry through them. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous works, protective forgiveness and a great reward"
  49,1,"O you who believe ! do not precede Allah and His messenger and fear Allah, Allah is certainly Hearing, Knowing"
  49,2,"O you who believe! do not raise your voices above the voice of the prophet and do not speak aloud to him while talking (to him) as you speak aloud to each other, lest your deeds become fruitless while you do not perceive"
  49,3,"Those who lower their voices in the presence of the messenger of Allah, are certainly those whose hearts Allah has cleared for (receiving the quality of) guarding (against evil), for them there is protective forgiveness and a great reward"
  49,4,"Those who call you from behind the private apartments, most of them have no sense"
