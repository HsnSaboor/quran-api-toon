quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  18,84,We certainly established him in the earth and gave him means of (access to) everything
  18,85,So he followed a way
  18,86,"until when he reached the setting place of the sun (west), he found it setting in a black muddy spring (or Black Sea) and found near it a people. We said, \"O Zulqarnain ! either punish or treat them in a good manner"
  18,87,"He said, \"As for him who is unjust we will punish him then he will be returned to his Fosterer then He will punish him with an awful punishment"
  18,88,"And as for him who believes and does righteous work, then his reward will be good and we will speak to him in an easy (tone) with regard to our affair"
  18,89,Then he followed a way
  18,90,"until when he reached the rising place of the sun (east), he found it rising on a people for whom We had not made any shelter from it"
  18,91,Thus! and We had comprehensive information about (all) that was with him
  18,92,Then he followed a way
  18,93,until when he reached (a place)between two mountains he found on the other side of the (two mountains) a people who could hardly understand a word
  18,94,"They said, \"O Zulqarnain! Yajooj and Majooj are causing corruption in the earth. Then shall we pay you a tribute on (condition) that you make a barrier between us and them"
  18,95,"He said, \"That in which my Fosterer has established me is better, so help me with strength (workers), I will make between you and them a strong bank (wall)"
  18,96,"bring me blocks of iron.\" Then at the point when he had leveled (the space) between the two mountain sides, he said, \"Blow,\" until when he made it (red hot) fire, he said, \"Bring me molten copper which I may pour over it"
  18,97,Thus they all (communities of Yajooj and Majooj) were not able to climb it nor were they able to pierce it
