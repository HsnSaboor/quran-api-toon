quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,26,"And Firawn said, “Leave me to kill Musa and let him call his Fosterer, I fear that he will change your religion or he will make corruption to appear in the earth.”"
  40,27,"And Musa said, “I seek the protection of my Fosterer and your Fosterer from every proud person who does not believe in the day of account.”"
  40,28,"And a believing man from among Firawn’s people who had kept his belief a secret, said, “Do you kill a man ( just ) because he says: My Fosterer is Allah and he has come to you with clear proofs from your Fosterer? And if he is a liar then on him will be ( the responsibility of ) his lie, but if he is truthful, then something of that which he is threatening you ( with ), will afflict you. Allah certainly does not guide him who is extravagant, a liar"
  40,29,"O my people! Yours is the government this day and you are uppermost in the earth, but who will help us against the punishment of Allah if it comes to us?” Firawn said, “I do not show you anything except that which I see ( good for you ) and I do not lead you but to the right way.”"
  40,30,"And he who had believed said, “O my people ! I fear for you ( something ) like the day of ( disaster which befell the ancient ) parties"
  40,31,like those of the people of Nuh and Aad and Samood and those after them. And Allah does not intent injustice for ( His ) servants
  40,32,And O my people ! I fear for you the day of summoning
  40,33,"the day on which you will turn your backs retreating, there will be no protector for you from Allah and he whom Allah leaves to stray, then there is no guide for him"
