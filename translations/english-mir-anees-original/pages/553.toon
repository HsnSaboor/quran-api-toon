quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  62,1,"Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth, glorifies Allah, the King, the Holy, the Mighty, the Wise"
  62,2,"He it is Who raised among the unlettered, a messenger from among them, he recites to them His signs and purifies them and teaches them the book (the law) and the wisdom, (interpretation of the law) and earlier they were in clear error"
  62,3,"and (will do so to) others (too) from among those who have not yet joined them. And He is the Mighty, the Wise"
  62,4,"That is the grace of Allah, He gives it to whom He wills, and Allah is the Possessor of great grace"
  62,5,"The likeness of those who were (entrusted) with the burden (of implementing) the Torah then they did not bear this burden, is like the likeness of a donkey which bears the burden of books. Evil is the likeness of the people who deny the signs of Allah. And Allah does not guide the unjust people"
  62,6,"Say, “O you who are Jews ! if you claim that you are the friends of Allah to the exclusion of other human beings, then desire for death, if you are truthful.”"
  62,7,"But they will never desire for it because of that which their hands have sent in advance, and Allah is the Knower of those who are unjust"
  62,8,"Say, “The death from which you run away will certainly meet you, then you will be turned towards the Knower of the unseen and the seen and He will inform you of that which you used to do.”"
