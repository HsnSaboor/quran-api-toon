quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By the time (i.e. historic time is witness that)
  103,2,Man is certainly at a loss
  103,3,"except those who believe and do righteous works and recommend to one another, the truth, and recommend to one another, patience"
  104,1,"Sorrowful is the state of every slanderer, defamer"
  104,2,who accumulates wealth and keeps on counting it
  104,3,He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal
  104,4,"No, he will definitely be flung into the crushing one"
  104,5,And what will make you realize what the crushing one is
  104,6,"(It is the) fire of Allah, kindled"
  104,7,which is made to rise over the hearts
  104,8,it will certainly be closed on them
  104,9,in columns that are stretched
  105,1,"Did you not consider, how your Fosterer dealt with the owners of the elephant"
  105,2,Did He not make their plot useless
  105,3,and send on them flocks of flying creatures
  105,4,who pelted them with stones of baked clay
  105,5,so that He made them like eaten up straw (husk)
