quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  8,70,"O prophet ! say to those of the prisoners (of war) in your hands (control), \"If Allah knows (marks out) anything good in your hearts He will give you (something) better than that which was taken from you and He will protectively forgive you and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
  8,71,"But if they intend to betray you, then they had betrayed Allah earlier, so He has given (you) power over them and Allah is Knowing, Wise"
  8,72,"Those who believed and migrated and struggled in the way of Allah with their wealth and their persons, and those who gave shelter and helped (the immigrants), those are certainly guardians of each other. And those who believed but did not migrate, it is not for you to guard them from anything till they migrate, but if they seek help from you in (the matter of) religion then it is your duty to help them except against a people between whom and you there is a treaty, and Allah is a Seer of what you do"
  8,73,"And those who do not believe, they are guardians of each other, unless you (too) do this (that is, mutually guard and help each other) there will be persecution in the earth and great corruption"
  8,74,"And those who believed and migrated and struggled in the way of Allah, and those who gave shelter and helped (the immigrants), those persons are the real believers, for them there is protective forgiveness and an honourable provision"
  8,75,"And those who believed afterwards and migrated and struggled along with you, they (too) are of you, but those having relationships (of blood) are nearer to each other in the ordinance of Allah. Allah is certainly the Knower of everything"
