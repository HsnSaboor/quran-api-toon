quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  30,33,"And when harm afflicts human beings, they pray to their Fosterer being those who turn to Him repentance, but when He (makes) them taste mercy from Him, then a party of them associates partners with their Fosterer"
  30,34,"so as to be ungrateful for that which We have given them, so enjoy yourselves, but you will come know"
  30,35,Or have We sent down on them an authority so that it tells (them something) about that which they should associate as partners with Him
  30,36,"And when We make human beings taste mercy, they rejoice in it, and if evil befalls them because that which their (own) hands have sent forth, then they are in despair"
  30,37,Did they not see that Allah enlarges the provision for whom He wills and straitens (it for whomever and whatever He wills)? Certainly there are signs in that for a people who believe
  30,38,"So give to the relative his due and (also) to the needy and the wayfarer. That is best for those who intend (to seek) the Attention of Allah, and those are the persons who are successful"
  30,39,"And that which you give as usury that it may (cause an) increase in the wealth of mankind, it does increase with Allah; but that which you give as charity (zakat) intending (to seek) the Attention of Allah, then those are the persons who (get back) multiplied"
  30,40,"It is Allah Who created you then provided for you, then He causes you to die then He will bring to life. Is there anyone of your (presumed) partners (of Allah) who does any of those things? Glory be Him and the Exalted be He above that which they associate (with Him) as partners"
  30,41,"Corruption has appeared in the land and the sea because of that which the hands of human beings have earned, that He may make them taste (the result of) a part of that which they have done so that they may return (to the truth)"
