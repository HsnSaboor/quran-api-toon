  34,3,"And those who do not believe say, “The hour of doom will not come upon us,” Say, “Why not? By my Fosterer, it will definitely come upon you.”(He is) the Knower of the unseen, not (even) the weight of a particle in the skies or in the earth, nor (something) less than that or greater, is hidden from Him but (it is recorded) in a clear record"
