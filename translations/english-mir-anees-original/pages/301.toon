  18,62,"So when they had gone further (after crossing the junction), he said to his servant, \"Bring to us our morning meal, we have met with fatigue from this journey of ours"
  18,63,"He (the servant) said, \"Did you see! when we stayed on the rock, I forgot the fish, and nothing made me forget to mention it (to you) but the devil, and it took its way into the sea (in) a wonderful (way)"
  18,64,"He (Musa) said, \"That is what we have been seeking for.” So they returned retracing their footsteps"
  18,65,(and) thus they found a servant from among Our servants whom We had given mercy from Us and whom We had given knowledge from Our knowledge
  18,66,"Musa said to him, \"May I follow you on (the agreement) that you teach me right (knowledge) from that which you have been taught"
  18,67,"He said, “You will not be able to be patient with me"
  18,68,And how can you have patience on (matters) about which you do not have comprehensive information
  18,69,"He (Musa) said, \"You will find me, if Allah wills, patient. And I will not disobey you in any matter"
  18,70,"He said, \"Well, if you follow me then do not ask me about anything till I myself mention about it to you"
  18,71,"So they both proceeded until when they embarked in a boat, he made a hole in it. He (Musa) said, \"Have you made a hole in it to drown those in it? You have indeed come with something strange"
  18,72,"He said, \"Did I not tell you that you will not be able to be patient with me"
  18,73,"He (Musa) said, \"Do not catch me for what I forgot and do not involve me in difficulty in my affair"
  18,74,"Then they proceeded until when they met a young man and he killed him. He (Musa) said, \"Have you killed an innocent person without (this murder being in retaliation to his unjustly killing some other) person ? You have indeed come with something unrecognised"
