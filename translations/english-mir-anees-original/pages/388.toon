quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,22,"And when he turned his face towards Midian he said, “Perhaps my Fosterer will guide me to a balanced way.”"
  28,23,"And when he came to the watering (place) of Midian he found there a group of people watering (their flocks), and besides them, he found two women staying back. He said, “ What is the matter with you?” They said, “We cannot water until the shepherds take away (their flocks), and our father is a very old man.”"
  28,24,"So he watered for them, then turned back to the shade and said, “My Fosterer! I am certainly in need of whatever good you send down on me.”"
  28,25,"Then one of the two (women) came to him walking shyly, she said, “My father invites you that he may reward you with a payment for having watered for us.” So when he came to him and narrated (his) narrative, he said, “Do not fear, you are safe from the unjust people.”"
  28,26,"One of the two (women) said, “O my father! employ him (on wages), certainly the best among those whom you can employ, is the one (who is) strong, trustworthy.”"
  28,27,"He said, “I intend to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine, on condition that you should be in my employment for eight years but if you complete ten then it will be from (your own good will), and I do not intend to put you under hardship, and if Allah wills, you will find me of the righteous.”"
  28,28,"He said, “ That (is settled) between me and you, whichever of the two terms I fulfill, but let there be no unjust (compulsion) on me, and Allah is the Trustee over what we say.”"
