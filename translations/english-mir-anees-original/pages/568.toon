quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,"so he (too) this day, has no intimate friend here"
  69,36,nor any food except the corruption from the washings of wounds
  69,37,none will eat it except the defaulters.”
  69,38,So I do swear by that which you see
  69,39,and that which you do not see (that)
  69,40,This (Quran) is certainly the word of an honoured messenger
  69,41,"and it is not a word of a poet, little is it that you believe"
  69,42,"and it is not a word of a soothsayer, little is it that you mind"
  69,43,(it has been) sent down from the Fosterer of the worlds
  69,44,"And had he said some words about Us on his own behalf (and attributed them to Us, then)"
  69,45,We would have seized him by his right hand
  69,46,then We would have cut off the artery of his heart
  69,47,and not one of you could have withheld Us from him
  69,48,And it is certainly a reminder for those who guard (against evil)
  69,49,And We certainly know that among you are deniers
  69,50,And it will certainly be (a source of) regret for the infidels
  69,51,And surely it is the truth (deserving) certainty
  69,52,So glorify the name of your Great Fosterer
  70,1,A questioner asked about the punishment to fall
  70,2,"For the infidels, there will be no defender for it"
  70,3,"(It will be) from Allah, Possessor of the ways of ascent"
  70,4,"The angels and the spirit ascend to Him, in a day (period), the measure of which is fifty thousand years"
  70,5,So be patient with the patience that is good
  70,6,They certainly see it far
  70,7,while We see it near
  70,8,The day when the sky will become like molten brass
  70,9,and the mountains will be like coloured wool
  70,10,and (even) an intimate friend will not inquire from another intimate friend
