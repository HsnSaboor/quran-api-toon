quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,109,"And whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is Allah's, and (all) the affairs are returned to Allah"
  3,110,"You are the best community raised for humanity. You enjoin that which is recognised (as good) and forbid that which is not recognised (as good) and you believe in Allah; and had the owners of the book (too) believed, it would have been better for them, among them there are believers, but most of them are transgressors"
  3,111,"They will not harm you except annoying (you), and if they fight with you, they will turn their backs to you, then they will not be helped"
  3,112,"Disgrace was made to strike them wherever they were found, except (when they sought) means of Allah and means of human beings, and they became deserving of the anger of Allah, and wretchedness was made to strike them. That was because they used to reject the signs of Allah and kill the prophets without having the right to do so. That was because they disobeyed and they were the persons who exceeded the limits"
  3,113,"They (all) are not the same. From among the owners of the book, (there is) an upright community, they read the statements of Allah during the hours of the night and they prostrate"
  3,114,"They believe in Allah and the period hereafter and enjoin that which is recognised (as good) and forbid that which is not recognised (as good) and hasten in doing good works, and they are of the righteous"
  3,115,"And whatever good they do, they will not be refused (the reward of) it, and Allah is the Knower of those who guard (against evil)"
