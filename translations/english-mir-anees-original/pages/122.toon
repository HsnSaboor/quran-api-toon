quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"And when they hear that which is sent down to the messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of their recognition of the truth. They say, \"Our Fosterer ! we believe, so write us down with those who bear witness"
  5,84,And what (reason) do we have that we should not believe in Allah and in the truth that has come to us? And we hope that our Fosterer will make us enter with the righteous people
  5,85,"So Allah rewarded them, for that which they said, (with) gardens beneath which rivers flow, they will stay therein, and that is the reward of the doers of good"
  5,86,"And those who do not believe and deny Our signs, they are the inhabitants of hell"
  5,87,"O you who believe ! do not make unlawful, the good things which Allah has made lawful for you and do not exceed the limits, Allah certainly does not like those who exceed the limits"
  5,88,"And eat from lawful good things which Allah has provided for you, and fear Allah in Whom you are believers"
  5,89,"Allah will not catch you for that which is vain (unintentional) in your oaths, but He will catch you for the oaths with which you are earnestly tied up. Then for its expiation (so as to wipe off the ill effect of breaking such deliberate oaths you should) feed ten poor persons with the normal food with which you feed your own people or clothe them or set free a slave, but whoever does not find (the means to do any of the above three) then he should fast for three days. That is for the expiation of your oaths when you have sworn, but guard your oaths. Thus Allah makes clear to you His signs that you may be grateful"
