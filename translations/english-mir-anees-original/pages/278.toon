quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  16,94,"And do not take your oaths (as a means of) deceit between you, so that your foot should slip after its establishment, and you should taste evil because you turned away (people) from the way of Allah and there should be a great punishment for you"
  16,95,And do not sell the agreement of Allah for a small price. Only that which is with Allah is better for you if you were to know
  16,96,"That which is with you passes away and that which is with Allah remains. And We will definitely reward, those who are patient, with their reward (which will be) better than that which they used to do"
  16,97,"Whoever does righteous work, whether male or female and he/she is a believer, We will definitely cause him/her to live a good life and We will definitely reward them with their reward (which will be) better than that which they used to do"
  16,98,"So when you recite the Quran, seek the protection of Allah from the accursed devil"
  16,99,he certainly has no authority over those who believe and put their trust in their Fosterer
  16,100,he has authority only on those who turn to him (for friendship) and those who are polytheists because of him
  16,101,"And when We change (one) sign in the place of (another) sign, and Allah knows best that which He sends down, they say, “You are only a forger.” No! the majority of them does not know"
  16,102,"Say, “The holy spirit has brought it down from your Fosterer in truth, that those who believe may be established, and (it is) a guidance and good news for those who submit (as Muslims).”"
