quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  58,7,"Did they not consider that Allah knows whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth. There is no secret talk (between) three but He is the fourth of them nor (between) five but He is the sixth of them , nor less than that nor more but He is with them wherever they are, then on the day of resurrection He will inform them about that which they did, Allah is certainly the Knower of everything"
  58,8,"Did you not see towards those who were forbidden from secret talks, then (again) they return to that which they were forbidden, and they hold secret talks for sin and transgression and disobedience to the messenger. And when they come to you, they greet you with (a greeting) with which Allah does not greet you, and they say among themselves, “Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?” Hell is enough for them, they will enter it, so evil is (their) destination"
  58,9,"O you who believe ! when you hold secret talks, then do not hold (these) secret talks for sin and transgression and disobedience to the messenger, but hold secret talks for righteousness and guarding (against evil) and fear Allah towards Whom you will be gathered"
  58,10,"The secret talks (i.e. the evil suggestions) of the devil are only to grieve those who believe but he cannot harm them in anything, except with Allah’s permission, so let the believers put their trust in Allah"
  58,11,"O you who believe! when it is said to you “Make room in assemblies,” then make room, Allah will make room for you. And when it is said, “Rise up,” then rise up, Allah will exalt in degrees those who believe from among you and those who are given knowledge, and Allah is informed of that which you do"
