  3,20,"So if they dispute with you then say, \"I have submitted myself (totally) to Allah and (so have) those who follow me,\" and say to those who were given the book and those who are not learned, \"Do you submit?\" So if they submit, then indeed they are rightly guided, but if they turn away then (the responsibility) upon you is only conveyance of the message and Allah is the Seer of His servants"
