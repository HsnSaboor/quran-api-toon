quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,30,"The day every soul will find that which it did of good present (before it) along with that which it did of evil, it shall wish that between it (soul) and the (evil) there were a long distance. And Allah makes you cautious of Himself and Allah is full of pity for (His) servants"
  3,31,"Say, \"If you love Allah then follow me, Allah will love you and protectively forgive you your sins and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
  3,32,"Say, \"Obey Allah and the messenger.\" But if they turn away, then Allah certainly does not like the infidels"
  3,33,Allah certainly selected Adam and Nuh and the family of Ibrahim and the family of Imran above the worlds
  3,34,"Some of them were offspring of the others, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing"
  3,35,"When the wife of Imran said, \"My Fosterer ! I vow to you that which is in my womb to be set free (for your service), so accept (it) from me. You are certainly Hearing, Knowing"
  3,36,"Then when she delivered it, she said, \"My Fosterer! I have delivered it a female.\" And Allah knew best what she had delivered, and the male is not like the female. \"And I have named her Maryam and I seek Your protection for her and her offspring, from the devil, the outcast"
  3,37,"So her Fosterer accepted her with a good acceptance and made her (Maryam) grow into a good growth and gave her into the guardianship of Zakariyya. Whenever Zakariyya entered the sanctuary to (see) her, he found provision (food) with her, he said, \"O Maryam! from where (does) this (provision) come to you?\" She said, \"It is from (that which is ) with Allah.\" Allah certainly provides without measure to whom He wills"
