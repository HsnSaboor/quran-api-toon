quran[3]{c,v,t}:
  4,12,"And for you half of what your wives leave behind if they have no child, but if they have a child then for you is one fourth of what they leave behind, after fulfilling the directions of the deceased with which they had directed or (payment of ) loan (which they left unpaid); and for the (wives) one fourth of what you leave behind if you have no child, but if you have a child then for them is one eighth of what you leave behind after fulfilling the directions with which you had directed or (payment of ) loan (which you left unpaid). And if a man or a woman whose (property) is to be inherited, has neither ascendants nor descendants and he/she has a brother or sister then to each one of the two one sixth, but if there are more than that then they are sharers in one third after fulfilling the directions of the deceased with which he had directed or (payment of) loan (which he/she left unpaid) without harming; (this is a ) direction from Allah and Allah is Knowing, Clement (Kind). one fourth of what you leave behind if you have no child, but if you have a child then for them is one eighth of what you leave behind after fulfilling the directions with which you had directed or (payment of ) loan (which you left unpaid). And if a man or a woman whose (property) is to be inherited, has neither ascendants nor descendants and he/she has a brother or sister then to each one of the two one sixth, but if there are more than that then they are sharers in one third after fulfilling the directions of the deceased with which he had directed or (payment of) loan (which he/she left unpaid) without harming; (this is a ) direction from Allah and Allah is Knowing, Clement (Kind)"
