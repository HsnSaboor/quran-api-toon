quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  57,12,"One day you will see the believing men and the believing women, their light running before them and on their right hand (side), good news to you this day: gardens beneath which rivers flow, for staying therein. That is the great achievement"
  57,13,"That day the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women will say to those who believe, “Wait for us, that we may get light from your light,” it will be said, “Go back to your rear (past life if possible) then seek a light.” Then a wall will be set up between them for which there will be a gate, inside of it there will be mercy and on the outer side of it (there will be) punishment"
  57,14,"The (hypocrites) will call out to the (believers), “Were we not with you?” They will say, “Why not! but you yourselves fell into temptation and you hesitated and doubted and your desires deceived you till the command of Allah came, and the deceiver deceived you concerning Allah.”"
  57,15,"So on that day no ransom will be accepted from you nor from those who did not believe, your settling place will be the fire, that is your (place of) turning back and it is an evil destination"
  57,16,"Has not the time come for those who believe, that their hearts become humbled for the remembrance of Allah and that which Allah has sent down of the truth, and (that) they do not become like those who were given the book earlier? So, as the time passed on them their hearts hardened and many of them were transgressors"
  57,17,"Know that Allah gives life to the earth after its death, He makes the signs clear for you that you may understand"
  57,18,The men who give charity and the women who give charity and loan to Allah a good loan. He will certainly double it for them and for them there will be an honourable reward
