quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,"And how would you reject, when you are those to whom the statements of Allah are read and His messenger (too) is among you? And whoever holds firmly to Allah, he indeed is guided to the straight path"
  3,102,O you who believe ! fear Allah as He ought to be feared and do not die unless you are Muslims
  3,103,"And hold together (and be united) through the rope of Allah and do not be divided. And remember the favour of Allah on you, when you were enemies then He united your hearts, so by His favour you became brothers, and you were on the edge of a pit of fire then He saved you from it, thus does Allah make clear to you His signs that you may receive guidance"
  3,104,"And there should be a leading group among you who should invite (people) towards good and enjoin that which is recognised (as good) and forbid that which is not recognised (as good), and those are the persons who are successful"
  3,105,"And do not be like those who were divided (among themselves) and disagreed after the clear proofs had come to them, and those are the persons for whom there is a great punishment"
  3,106,"On the day when (some) faces will be white while (other) faces will be black, then as for those whose faces will be black, (it will be said), \"Did you become infidels after your belief ? Then taste the punishment because you did not believe"
  3,107,"And as for those whose faces will be white, then they will be the persons who will stay in the mercy of Allah"
  3,108,"Those are the statements of Allah which we read to you correctly, and Allah does not intend injustice to the worlds"
