quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  14,34,"And He gives you everything which you ask from Him and if you count Allah’s favours you will not be able to compute them. Man is certainly unjust, ungrateful"
  14,35,"And when Ibrahim said, “My Fosterer ! make this city secure and save me and my sons from worshipping idols"
  14,36,"My Fosterer ! they have misled many of the mankind, so whoever follows me is of me and whoever disobeys me, then certainly You are Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
  14,37,"Our Fosterer ! I have settled (some) of my off-spring in a valley without cultivation, near Your Sacred House, our Fosterer ! that they may establish worship (salat), so make the hearts of mankind to incline towards them, and provide them with fruits that they may be grateful"
  14,38,Our Fosterer ! You certainly know that which we hide and that which we make public and nothing is hidden from Allah (whether) in the earth or in the sky
  14,39,"Praise is due only for Allah Who has granted me in old age, Ismael and Ishaq, my Fosterer is certainly the Hearer of prayer"
  14,40,My Fosterer ! make me one who establishes worship (salat) and (also) from my offspring. Our Fosterer ! and accept my prayer
  14,41,Our Fosterer ! protectively forgive me and my parents and the believers on the day the account (of deeds) will be established.”
  14,42,And do not think that Allah is unaware of that which the unjust do. He only gives them time till the day on which the eyes will stare (in horror)
