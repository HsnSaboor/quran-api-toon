quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  13,6,"And they ask you to hasten on the evil before the good, when there have been exemplary punishments before them. And your Fosterer is certainly Protectively Forgiving to mankind (inspite) of their being unjust and your Fosterer (at the same time) is certainly Severe in requiting (evil)"
  13,7,"And those who do not believe say, “Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Fosterer?” You are only a warner and for every people there is a guide"
  13,8,"And Allah knows that which every female bears and that which the wombs absorb and that which they grow; and with Him, everything is according to a programme"
  13,9,"Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Great, the Most High"
  13,10,"He who speaks secretly from among you and he who speaks openly and he who hides himself in the night and (he who) goes forth in the day time, are all equal (to Him)"
  13,11,"For him there are (angels) following him closely, before him and behind him, protecting him by the command of Allah. Allah certainly does not change (the condition) in which a people are, until they change that which is in their souls. And when Allah intends evil for a people then there is no turning it back, and besides Him there is no guardian for them"
  13,12,He it is Who shows you the lightning (causing) fear and hope and He produces the heavy clouds
  13,13,"And the thunder glorifies Him with His praise and the angels (too), because of His fear; and He sends the thunder-bolts, then strikes with it whom He wills, and they dispute about Allah while He is Severely Powerful"
