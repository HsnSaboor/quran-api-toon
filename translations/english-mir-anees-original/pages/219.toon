quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,89,"He said, “The prayer of both of you is accepted, so be established (on your religion) and do not follow the way of those who do not have knowledge.”"
  10,90,"And We made the children of Israel to cross the sea. Then Firawn and his army followed them in rebellion and transgression till when the drowning grasped him, he said, “I believe that there is no god but He in Whom the children of Israel believe and I am of those who submit (as Muslims).” m the children of Israel believe and I am of those who submit (as Muslims).”"
  10,91,What ! now ! and you had disobeyed earlier and you were of those who were corrupt
  10,92,"So this day We will deliver you in (the form of) your bodythat you may be a sign for those who come after you, and certainly there are many of the human beings who are heedless of Our signs"
  10,93,"And We indeed made the children of Israel settle down a real settling and We provided them with the good things, then they did not disagree till the knowledge came to them. Your Fosterer will certainly decide between them on the day of resurrection concerning that in which they used to disagree"
  10,94,So if you are in a doubt regarding that which We have sent down to you then ask those who read the book (which was revealed) before you. The truth has indeed come to you from your Fosterer so do not be of those who doubt
  10,95,"And do not be of those who deny the signs of Allah, then you (too) will be of those who are losers"
  10,96,Those on whom the word of your Fosterer has proved true will certainly not believe
  10,97,"even if every sign comes to them, till they see the painful punishment"
