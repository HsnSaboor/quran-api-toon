quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  73,1,O you who are wrapped up in garments
  73,2,Rise (to pray in) the night except a little
  73,3,half of it or a little less than that
  73,4,or increase it and recite the Quran gradually (giving) intervals
  73,5,We will put on you (the responsibility of delivering) a weighty statement
  73,6,The rising at night (for righteous work) certainly gives rise to more strength of co-ordination and firmly established speech (because)
  73,7,during the day you certainly have prolonged occupation
  73,8,And remember the name of your Fosterer and devote yourself to Him (with exclusive) devotion
  73,9,"Fosterer of the east and the west, there is no god except Him, so take Him as a Trustee"
  73,10,And be patient on what they say and keep away from them in a good (manner of) keeping away
  73,11,"And leave Me and the deniers, the possessors of favours (from Me) and give them a little time"
  73,12,"Certainly, with Us are heavy fetters and hell fire"
  73,13,and a food that chokes and a painful punishment
  73,14,"The day the earth will quake and the mountains (too), and the mountains will become a heap of running sand"
  73,15,"We have sent to you a messenger, a witness over you, as We had sent a messenger to Firawn"
  73,16,"But Firawn disobeyed the messenger, so We seized him with a severe seizure"
  73,17,"If you reject, then how will you guard (yourselves) on the day which will make children grey headed"
  73,18,(and) on which (day) the sky will be cleft asunder ? His promise is to be fulfilled
  73,19,"This is certainly a reminder, so whoever wills, let him take a way towards his Fosterer"
