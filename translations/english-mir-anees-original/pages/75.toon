  3,187,"And when Allah took a pledge from those who were given the book, \"You shall make the (book) clear to mankind and you shall not hide it,\" they threw it behind their backs and purchased a small gain through it, so evil is that which they purchased"
  3,188,"Do not think that those who are happy for that which they have done and love to be praised for what they did not do, so do not think that they are in safety from the punishment when there is a painful punishment (waiting) for them"

  3,190,"In the creation of the skies (heavenly bodies) and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day, certainly there are signs for men of understanding"
  3,191,"who remember Allah, standing and sitting and lying on their sides and reflect on the creation of the skies and the earth, \" O our Fosterer ! You have not created this in vain. You are Glorified ( above all ) so save us from the punishment of the fire"
  3,192,"Our Fosterer ! whomever You make to enter the fire, You have certainly disgraced him, and for those who are unjust there will be no helpers"
  3,193,"Our Fosterer ! we heard the call of one calling to belief, saying: Believe in your Fosterer, so we believed. Our Fosterer ! so protectively forgive us our sins and remove from us (the effect of) our evil deeds and pay us back in full (or make us die) along with the righteous"
  3,194,"Our Fosterer ! and grant us that which You promised us through Your messengers and do not disgrace us on the day of resurrection, You certainly do not go against Your promise"
