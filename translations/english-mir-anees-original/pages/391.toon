quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,44,And you were not on the western side when We decreed the commandment to Musa and you were not among the witnesses
  28,45,"But We produced generations and life lasted on them, and you were not dwelling among the people of Midian reciting to them Our signs, but We were the senders (of messengers)"
  28,46,"And you were not at the side of the Mount Toor when We called out (to Musa), but (this information is) a mercy from your Fosterer that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you that they may be mindful"
  28,47,"And had (you) not been (sent and had) they been afflicted with a disaster because of what their hands had sent before, then they would have said, “Our Fosterer! why did You not send a messenger to us, so that we could follow Your signs (instructions) and be among the believers.”"
  28,48,"But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “Why is he not given the like of what was given to Musa?” Did they not reject that which was given to Musa earlier? They say, “Two magicians helping each other,” and they say, “We certainly do not believe in all.”"
  28,49,"Say, “Then bring a book from Allah which is a better guide than these two (that) I may follow it, if you are truthful.”"
  28,50,"But if they do not respond to you, then know that they follow only their desires, and who is more astray than one who follows his desire without guidance from Allah, Allah certainly does not guide the unjust people"
