quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  2,154,And do not say for those who are slain in the way of Allah (that they are) dead. No! they are alive but you do not perceive
  2,155,And We will definitely test you with something of fear and hunger and loss in wealth and life and fruits (results of efforts) and convey good news to the patient
  2,156,"who, when a disaster falls on them, say, \"We are Allah's and we have to return to Him"
  2,157,"Those are the persons over whom are blessings from their Fosterer with (His) mercy, and those are the persons who receive guidance"
  2,158,"The (hills of ) Safa and Marwa are certainly among the symbols of Allah, so whoever is on a pilgrimage (Hajj) to the house (Kaaba) or pays a visit (Umrah) there is no sin on him if he goes around both of them, and whoever does good willingly, then Allah is certainly One Who acknowledges, the Knower"
  2,159,"Those who hide that which We have sent down ( in the form ) of clear proofs and guidance, after what We had made clear for the human beings in the book, they are certainly the persons whom Allah curses and (also) curse them, those who curse"
  2,160,"except those who repent and amend and make clear ( the truth which they were hiding). Then those are the persons towards whom I turn (mercifully) and I am the Accepter of repentance, the Merciful"
  2,161,"Those who did not believe and died while they were infidels, they are certainly the persons over whom is the curse of Allah and the angels and the human beings combined"
  2,162,"they will stay therein, their punishment will not be lightened over them nor will they be given time"
  2,163,"And your God is One God, there is no god except Him, the Beneficent, the Merciful"
