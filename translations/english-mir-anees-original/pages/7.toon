quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  2,38,"We said, \"All of you go down from here, so whenever guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, then (as a result of this) there will neither be any fear on them nor will they grieve"
  2,39,"And those who do not believe and deny Our signs , those will be the inhabitants of the fire, in it they will stay"
  2,40,"O children of Israel ! remember My favour with which I favoured you and fulfill (your) agreement with Me, I will fulfill (My) agreement with you and then fear Me alone"
  2,41,"And believe in the (Quran) which I have sent down confirming that (book) which is with you and do not be the first in not believing in it, and do not sell My signs for a small price and fear Me alone"
  2,42,And do not cover truth with falsehood nor hide the truth while you know
  2,43,And establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and bow down with those who bow down
  2,44,"What ! you enjoin people to be virtuous and forget it yourselves while you read the book, then have you no sense"
  2,45,And seek help through patience and worship (salat) and this is certainly difficult except for the humble ones
  2,46,those who expect that they will meet their Fosterer and that to Him they will return
  2,47,O children of Israel ! remember My favour with which I favoured you and that I preferably favoured you (compared to others in the) worlds
  2,48,"And guard yourselves against a day when no requital* will be accepted from one person for another in anything nor will recommendation be accepted for him nor will compensation be taken from him nor will they be helped. * Repayment for good or evil, reward or punishment"
