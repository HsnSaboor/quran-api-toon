quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,15,"And as for those of your women who are guilty of indecency, produce four witnesses against them from among you, then if they bear witness (by testifying the truth of the allegation) then withhold them inside the houses until death takes them away or Allah opens out for them (some) way"
  4,16,"And as for the two men who are guilty of the (indecency) from among you, punish them both, but if they repent and amend then turn away from them, Allah is certainly the Accepter of repentance, Merciful"
  4,17,"Acceptance of repentance by Allah, is only for those who do evil in ignorance then repent soon, so those are the persons from whom Allah accepts repentance and Allah is Knowing, Wise"
  4,18,"And acceptance of repentance is not for those who are involved in evil deeds until when death comes to one of them (and then) he says, \"Now I repent,\" nor for those who die while they are infidels, those are the persons for whom We have prepared a painful punishment"
  4,19,"O you who believe ! it is not lawful for you to inherit women forcibly; and do not withhold them (unjustly) that you may take away part of that which you have given them unless they are guilty of manifest indecency, but live with them in a recognised (good manner), and if you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing while Allah has placed plenty of good in it"
