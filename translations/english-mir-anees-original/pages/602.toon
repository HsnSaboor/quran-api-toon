quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,For the taming of Quraysh
  106,2,their taming in equipping caravans (for traveling) in winter and summer
  106,3,so let them serve the Fosterer of this house (Kaaba)
  106,4,Who has fed them in hunger and given them security from fear
  107,1,Did you see him who belies religion
  107,2,Then he is the one who pushes away the orphan
  107,3,and does not urge on the feeding of the poor
  107,4,So sorrowful is the state of the worshippers
  107,5,who are heedless of their worship (salat)
  107,6,(in the sense that they are) those who make a show (of their worship)
  107,7,and refuse small kindness
  108,1,We certainly gave you abundance
  108,2,so worship your Fosterer and sacrifice
  108,3,"The one who hates you, he is certainly without posterity"
