  28,72,"Say, “Do you consider, if Allah were to make the day everlasting on you till the day of resurrection, (then) who is the god other than Allah who could bring the night to you that you could rest therein ? Will you not then see"

  28,74,"And on (that) day He will call them and say, “Where are those whom you claimed (that they were) My partners?”"
  28,75,"And We will bring out from every community a witness, then We will say, “(All of you) bring your proof.” Then they will know that the truth is Allah’s, and that which they used to forge will go away from them"
  28,76,"Qaroon was certainly from among the people of Musa but he oppressed them. And We had given him so much from the treasures, that their keys would have been a burden (even) for a strong group of men possessing strength. When his people said to him, “Do not exult, Allah certainly does not like those who are exultant"
  28,77,"but seek the home of the hereafter through that which Allah has given you, and do not forget your portion of the world, and do good (to others) as Allah has done good to you, and do not seek to cause corruption in the earth, Allah certainly does not like those who are corrupt.”"
