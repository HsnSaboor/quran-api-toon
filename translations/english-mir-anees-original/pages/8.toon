quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  2,49,"And (remember) when We delivered you from the people of Firawn who subjected you to severe punishment, they slew your sons and left your women alive and in that there was a great trial from your Fosterer"
  2,50,and when We parted the sea for you and delivered you and drowned the people of Firawn while you were seeing
  2,51,And when We appointed for Musa forty nights then you took the calf (for worship) after he (had gone) and you were unjust
  2,52,then We pardoned you even after that so that you should be grateful
  2,53,And when We gave Musa the book (prescribed laws) and the distinction (between right and wrong) so that you may receive guidance
  2,54,"and when Musa said to his people, \"O my people ! you have certainly been unjust to yourselves by taking the calf (for worship) so turn towards your Purifier then kill yourselves, this is better for you (than calf worship), in the sight of your Purifier,\" then He turned to you (mercifully), He is certainly the Accepter of repentance, the Merciful"
  2,55,"And when you said, \"O Musa ! We will never believe in you till we see Allah openly,\" so you were caught (by the) thunder-bolt while you were seeing"
  2,56,then We raised you after your death so that you should be grateful
  2,57,"And We provided shade over you (through) the clouds and sent down manna and quails over you, \"Eat of the good things which We have provided for you.\" And they did not harm Us but they were unjust to themselves"
