quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,13,"Or they say, “He has forged it.” Say, “Then bring ten chapters like it, forged (if it is humanly possible) and call upon whom you can, besides Allah, (for helping you in forging it), if you are truthful.”"
  11,14,"But if they do not respond to you, then know that it has been sent down by the knowledge of Allah and that there is no god but He. Then will you be those who submit (as Muslims)"
  11,15,"Whoever intends the life of this world and its adornment, We will pay them in full for their deeds in (this world) itself and they will not have anything reduced in it"
  11,16,"Those are the persons for whom there is nothing in the hereafter except the fire, and the work which they did in the (world) will be fruitless and that which they used to do will become vain"
  11,17,"Then will he, who is on a clear proof from his Fosterer and a witness from Him reads it to him, and before it (when) there is the book of Musa, (as) a guide and a mercy, (not believe in the Quran)? They will believe in it. And whoever does not believe in it from among the parties, then the fire is his promised place. So do not be in doubt about it, it is certainly the truth from your Fosterer but the majority of human beings does not believe"
  11,18,"And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah? Those will be presented before their Fosterer and the witnesses will say, “These are the persons who lied against their Fosterer.” Beware ! the curse of Allah is on the unjust"
  11,19,Those who turn away (people) from the way of Allah and seek crookedness in it and they do not believe in the hereafter
