quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,It is certainly an honoured Quran
  56,78,in a book that is protected
  56,79,none touch it except those who are clean
  56,80,sent down from the Fosterer of the worlds
  56,81,"Then is it this statement which (is so important), that you take easy"
  56,82,"And you make it your livelihood, that you (go on) denying it"
  56,83,So why is it not that when the (soul) reaches the throat
  56,84,and you are at that time looking on (waiting)
  56,85,"and We are nearer to the (dying person) than you, but not visible to you"
  56,86,"so why is it not, if you are not bound by any law"
  56,87,"(that you) bring the (soul) back, if you are truthful"
  56,88,Then if he is from among those near (to Allah)
  56,89,then (he will have) happiness and fragrance and the garden of bliss
  56,90,And if he is from among the companions of the right hand
  56,91,"then (it will be said), “Peace for you, from those of the right hand.”"
  56,92,And if he is from among the deniers who are in error
  56,93,then the entertainment (for him) will be of boiling water
  56,94,and entry in hell
  56,95,This indeed is the certain truth
  56,96,So glorify the name of your Great Fosterer
  57,1,"Whatever is in the skies and the earth glorifies Allah and He is the Mighty, the Wise"
  57,2,"His is the kingdom of the skies and the earth, He gives life and causes to die and He has power over everything"
  57,3,He is the First and the Last and the Evident (Outer Most) and the Hidden (Inner Most) and He is the Knower of everything
