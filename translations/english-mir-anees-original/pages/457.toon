quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  38,62,"And they will say, “What is wrong with us that we do not see the men whom we counted among the evil ones"
  38,63,did we take them in ridicule (by mistake) or have our eyes turned away from them (that we do not see them in hell)?”
  38,64,That mutual dispute of the dwellers of the fire will certainly be true
  38,65,"Say, “I am only a warner and there is no god except Allah, the One, the Omnipotent"
  38,66,"Fosterer of the skies and the earth and whatever is between them, the Mighty, the Protectively Forgiving.”"
  38,67,"Say, “It is a great news"
  38,68,from which you are turning away
  38,69,I do not have any knowledge of the high assembly when they dispute
  38,70,nothing is communicated to me except that I am a clear warner.”
  38,71,"When your Fosterer said to the angels, “I am creating man from clay"
  38,72,"so when I set him up in equilibrium and I blow into him from My spirit, then fall bowing down before him.”"
  38,73,"So the angels bowed down, all of them together"
  38,74,"except Iblis, he considered himself great and became (one) of the infidels"
  38,75,"He (Allah) said, “O Iblis! what prevented you from bowing down before him whom I created with my hands? Did you consider yourself great or are you of those who are high (exalted)?”"
  38,76,"He said, “I am better than him, You created me from fire (i.e. energy), whereas You created him from clay (i.e. matter).”"
  38,77,"He said, “Get out from here, for you are certainly accursed"
  38,78,and My curse is certainly on you till the day of judgment.”
  38,79,"He said, “My Fosterer! give me time till the day they are raised.”"
  38,80,"He said, “You are of those who are given time"
  38,81,"till the day, the timing of which is known.”"
  38,82,"He said, “Then by Your might, I will definitely lead them astray, all together,”"
  38,83,except (those) among them (who are) exclusively Your servants.”
