quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  98,8,"Their reward is with their Fosterer: Gardens of everlasting bliss, underneath which rivers flow, they will stay therein for ever, Allah pleased with them and they pleased with Him. That is for him who fears his Fosterer"
  99,1,When the earth is quaked with its quaking
  99,2,and the earth brings out its weighty material
  99,3,"and man will say, “What ails her ?”"
  99,4,She will be made to tell her news on that day
  99,5,because your Fosterer (would have) communicated to her
  99,6,"On that day human beings will be brought forth in diverse groups, to be shown their deeds"
  99,7,"So whoever does good equivalent in weight, even to a small particle, will see it"
  99,8,"And whoever does evil equivalent in weight, even to a small particle, will see it"
  100,1,By those that move fast breathing heavily
  100,2,then those that strike fire striking
  100,3,then those that raid at dawn
  100,4,then thereby raise dust
  100,5,then penetrate into the midst of an assembly
  100,6,Man is certainly ungrateful to his Fosterer
  100,7,and he himself is a witness over that
  100,8,And he certainly has intense love for good (worldly wealth)
  100,9,"Then does he not know, that when that which is in the graves is exposed"
