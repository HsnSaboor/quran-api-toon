quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  60,12,"O prophet! when believing women come to you to take an oath of allegiance unto you that they will not associate anything with Allah and they will not steal and they will not commit adultery and they will not kill their children and they will not come with a false charge (on someone), forging it between their hands and their feet, and they will not disobey you in (what) is recognised (as good), then accept their allegiance and ask Allah for their protective forgiveness, Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
  60,13,"O you who believe! do not make friendship with a people on whom is Allah’s anger, they are indeed in despair about the hereafter as the infidels are in despair about those who are in graves"
  61,1,"Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth glorifies Allah and He is the Mighty, the Wise"
  61,2,O you who believe! why do you say that which you do not do
  61,3,It is most hateful to Allah that you say that which you do not do
  61,4,Allah certainly loves those who fight in His way in ranks as if they were a solid structure
  61,5,"And (remember) when Musa said to his people, “O my people! why do you annoy me when you indeed know that I am a messenger of Allah (sent) to you?” So when they deviated from the right Allah (also) deviated their hearts from the right and Allah does not guide a transgressing people"
