quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  68,16,We will brand him on the nose
  68,17,We tried them as We tried the inhabitants of the garden when they swore that they would pluck its fruit in the morning
  68,18,and they did not like to keep aside (a portion for the poor)
  68,19,"So there went around it, a circuit (of disaster) from your Fosterer while they were asleep"
  68,20,so that the (garden) became as if (it was already) plucked
  68,21,And they cried out to each other in the morning
  68,22,"saying, “Go to your field in the morning, if you are to pluck (the fruits).”"
  68,23,So they went whispering to one another
  68,24,"that, “No poor man shall enter it today (to beg) from you.”"
  68,25,"And (when they went) in the morning, (they presumed that) they had power on their determination (to pluck the fruit)"
  68,26,"but when they saw it, they said, “We are certainly in error"
  68,27,"no, we are those who have been deprived (of receiving the benefit of our labour).”"
  68,28,"One balanced among them said, “Did I not tell you? Had you glorified (by regarding Allah above all, this would not have happened).”"
  68,29,"They said, “Glorified be our Fosterer, we were certainly unjust.”"
  68,30,"Then they turned, some blaming the others"
  68,31,"They said, “Sorrowful is our state, we were rebellious"
  68,32,"it may be that our Fosterer will give us in exchange, a better (garden) than this; to our Fosterer (we turn as) seekers (of His grace).”"
  68,33,"Such was the punishment, and the punishment of the hereafter is greater, had they but known"
  68,34,"For those who guard (against evil), there will certainly be gardens of bliss with their Fosterer"
  68,35,"Shall We make those who submit (as Muslims), like the criminals"
  68,36,What is (wrong) with you? How do you judge
  68,37,Or have you a book through which you learn
  68,38,that you shall have therein what you choose
  68,39,Or do you have an agreement from Us which extends till the day of resurrection that you will have what you order (for)
  68,40,"Ask them, which of them will be a claimant of that"
  68,41,Or have they partners? Then let them bring their partners if they are truthful
  68,42,"On the day (the covering) will be removed from the ankle (there being a calamity), and they will be called for prostrations, but they will not be able to (prostrate)"
