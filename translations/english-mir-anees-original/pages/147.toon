quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  6,143,"Eight pairs, two of sheep and two of goats, say, \"Has He made unlawful the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Inform me with knowledge if you are truthful"
  6,144,"And two of camels and two of cows, say, \"Has He made unlawful the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you witnesses when Allah directed you with this?\" So who is more unjust than him who forges a lie against Allah to mislead human beings without knowledge? Allah certainly does not guide the unjust people"
  6,145,"Say, \"I do not find in that which is communicated to me, anything made unlawful for an eater to eat except that it be what has died of itself, or flowing blood, or flesh of swine, for that is certainly unclean; or exceeding the limits (by) invoking on the (food, the name of someone) other than Allah; but whoever is helplessly necessitated (to eat), neither desiring nor exceeding the limits, then your Fosterer is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
  6,146,"And on those who were Jews We had made unlawful every animal having claws, and of oxen and sheep We had made unlawful to them the fat of both, except that which adhered to their backs or the intestines or that mixed with the bone. We rewarded them with that because of their rebellion and We are certainly the Truthful"
