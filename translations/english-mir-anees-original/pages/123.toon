quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,90,"O you who believe ! intoxicants and games of chance and stones (set up around Kaaba for sacrificing animals, idols) and divining arrows * are only an uncleanliness from the devil's work, so avoid it that you may be successful * Casting lots with arrows"
  5,91,"The only intention of the devil is to cause enemity and hatred to befall among you through intoxicants and games of chance, and to turn you away from Allah's remembrance and worship (salat). Will you then desist"
  5,92,"And obey Allah and obey the messenger and be cautious, then if you turn away, know that (the duty incumbent) on Our messenger is only clear conveyance (of the message)"
  5,93,"There is no sin on those who believe and do righteous works in what they ate (in ignorance), when they (later) restrained (themselves from prohibited food) and believed and did righteous works, then restrained (themselves from evil) and again believed, then restrained (themselves from evil) and did good works and Allah loves the doers of good"
  5,94,"O you who believe ! Allah will definitely test you some what in respect of the game * which your hands and your spears can reach, that Allah may know (mark out) him who fears Him without having seen Him; so whoever exceeds the limits after that, then for him there is a painful punishment. * Hunting animals"
  5,95,"O you who believe ! do not kill the game while you are in the pilgrim's dress, and whoever among you kills it intentionally, then the compensation (as fine for it) the like of what he killed of the cattle, decided by two just persons from among you, to be brought to Kaaba as an offering; or the expiation (of it) is the feeding of the poor or the equivalent of that is fasting, that he may taste the evil consequence of his affair (of disobedience). Allah has pardoned that which was done in the past but whoever returns (to it), Allah will inflict retribution on him, and Allah is Mighty, Inflicter of retribution"
