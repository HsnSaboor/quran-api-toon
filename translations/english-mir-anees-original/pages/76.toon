  3,195,"So their Fosterer responded to them, \"I do not waste the work of a (single) worker among you, whether male or female, some of you are from others. So those who migrated and were driven out from their houses and were harmed in My way and who fought and were slain, I will definitely remove from them (the effect of) their evil deeds and I will definitely make them enter the gardens beneath which rivers flow,\" a reward from that which is with Allah, and the best reward is with Allah"
