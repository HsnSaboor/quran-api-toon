quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"who used to say: Are you of those who confirm"
  37,53,"that when we die and become(part of the) soil and bones, we will indeed be brought for judgment?”"
  37,54,"(Someone will) say, “Would you peep (to see him)?”"
  37,55,"So he will peep, then see him in the midst of hell"
  37,56,"He will say , “By Allah, you had almost destroyed me"
  37,57,"and had the favor of my Fosterer not been there, I (too) would have been (with you) among those presented (for punishment).”"
  37,58,"(The inhabitants of the garden will say), “Then is it that we will not die"
  37,59,"except our first death, and we will not be among those who are punished"
  37,60,This certainly is a great achievement.”
  37,61,"So let those who (wish to) work, work for (something) like this"
  37,62,Is this a better entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum
  37,63,We have made it an affliction for those who are unjust
  37,64,It is a tree that comes out from the bottom of the hell
  37,65,"Its produce resembles in likeness, the heads of devils"
  37,66,So they will eat from it then fill their stomachs with it
  37,67,then they will have a drink of boiling water over that
  37,68,Then their return will be to hell
  37,69,They certainly found their fathers astray
  37,70,"so they follow their footsteps, being in haste"
  37,71,"And the majority of the ancients before them, indeed went astray"
  37,72,and We had indeed sent warners among them
  37,73,so see how the end of those warned was (brought about)
  37,74,"except the servants, exclusively of Allah"
  37,75,"And Nuh prayed to Us, and We are Excellent Responders"
  37,76,so We saved him and his followers from the great distress
