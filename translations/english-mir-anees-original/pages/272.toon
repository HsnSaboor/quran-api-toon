  16,43,"And We did not send before you, (messengers) other than men, to whom We had communicated. So ask the people who remember, if you do not know"
  16,44,"(they came) with clear proofs and books. And We sent down the reminder to you, that you may make clear to mankind that which is sent down to them and that they may reflect"
  16,45,"Then, do those who plan evil (things consider themselves) secure that Allah will (not) sink the earth with them, or that the punishment will (not) come to them from directions they do not perceive"
  16,46,"or that He will (not) seize them in their going to and fro, when they will not be in (a position to) frustrate (Him)"
  16,47,"or that He will (not) seize them by causing them to suffer a gradual loss? But your Fosterer is certainly full of pity, Merciful"

  16,49,And to Allah bows down whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth of moving creatures and the angels and they do not consider themselves great
  16,50,They fear their Fosterer above them and do what they are commanded

  16,53,"And whatever (items of) comfort are with you they are from (no one) but Allah. Then when harm afflicts you, to Him (alone) do you cry for help"
  16,54,"But when He removes the harm from you, then (there is ) a party from among you, which associates partners with their Fosterer"
