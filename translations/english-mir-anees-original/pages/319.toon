quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  20,99,Thus do We narrate to you (some) of the news of what happened before. And We have given you a reminder from Us
  20,100,"one who turns away from it, then he will carry a burden on the day of resurrection"
  20,101,"staying under it, and it will be an evil (burden) for them to carry on the day of resurrection"
  20,102,"the day it will be blown into the trumpet (structure of the universe), and We will gather the criminals blind on that day"
  20,103,"whispering among themselves, ''You did not stay but (for) ten (days)"
  20,104,"We know best that which they talk about, when the best of them in tradition (following sequence of events) will say, \"You did not stay but (for) a day.\" (R)"
  20,105,"And they ask you about the mountains, so say, \"My Fosterer will uproot them (to result in) a disintegration"
  20,106,so that He will leave them as a leveled expanse
  20,107,You will see neither any crookedness nor unevenness
  20,108,"On that day they will all follow the announcer, there will be no crookedness (in responding) to him, and voices will humble before the Beneficent (Allah), so that you will not hear anything except a faint sound"
  20,109,"On that day mediation will not be profitable except of him whom the Beneficent (Allah) permits, and with whose word He is pleased"
  20,110,He knows that which is before them and that which is behind them but they cannot encompass it in(their) knowledge
  20,111,"And faces will humble before the Living, the Eternally Existing and he who carries (the burden of) injustice would indeed fail"
  20,112,"And whoever does works of righteousness while he is a believer, then he will have neither the fear of injustice nor of getting lesser than what is due to him"
  20,113,And thus We have sent it down an Arabic Quran and We have repeated in it (some) of the threats that they may guard (against evil) or (that) it may serve them as a reminder
