quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Then have you seen him who does not believe in Our signs and says, \"I will definitely be given wealth and children"
  19,78,Is the unseen disclosed to him or has he made an agreement with the Beneficent (Allah)
  19,79,"By no means, We will write down what he says and We will prolong for him (the period) of punishment (with a set) prolonging"
  19,80,And We will inherit from him what he says and he will come to Us alone
  19,81,And they have taken gods besides Allah that they may be (a source of) might for them
  19,82,"By no means, they (the false gods) will reject their having worshipped them and they will become their opponents"
  19,83,Did you not consider that We send the devils on the infidels to incite them with an incitement
  19,84,"So do not make haste against them, We only number for them, a number (of days)"
  19,85,"The day We will gather those who guard (against evil, like honourable) guests before the Beneficent (Allah)"
  19,86,and We will drive the criminals to hell (like) thirsty (cattle)
  19,87,"none will have the power to mediate except him who has received an agreement, (permission) from the Beneficent (Allah)"
  19,88,"And they say, \"The Beneficent (Allah) has taken (to Him self) a son"
  19,89,You have indeed come with a disastrous thing
  19,90,The skies are about to cleave asunder due to it and the earth to split asunder and the mountains to fall down in pieces
  19,91,that they invoke a son for the Beneficent (Allah)
  19,92,And it does not suit the Beneficent (Allah) that He should take (to Himself) a son
  19,93,there is no one in the skies and the earth but he comes to the Beneficent (Allah) as a servant
  19,94,He has computed them and numbered them a numbering
  19,95,"and everyone of them will come to Him on the day of resurrection, alone"
