quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,Those who do not believe in the hereafter certainly name the angels with female names
  53,28,"and they do not have any knowledge about it, they follow nothing but conjecture, and conjecture is certainly of no use in anything compared to the truth"
  53,29,So keep away from him who turns away from Our remembrance and desires nothing but the life of this world
  53,30,"That is the (ultimate) reach of their knowledge. Your Fosterer certainly knows best, him who goes astray from His way, and He knows best, him who receives guidance"
  53,31,And whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is Allah’s that He may reward those who do evil for that which they did and (that) He may reward those who do good with (something) better
  53,32,"Those who avoid great sins and indecencies except small faults, (then) your Fosterer is certainly Ample in protectively forgiving (them). He knew you best when He produced you from the earth and when you were hidden in the wombs of your mothers, therefore do not attribute purity to yourselves. He knows best him who guards (against evil)"
  53,33,Did you not see him who turns his back
  53,34,and gives a little and withholds
  53,35,Has he with him the knowledge of the unseen so that he sees
  53,36,Or was he not informed of that which was in the books of Musa
  53,37,"and Ibrahim, who fulfilled (his responsibility by informing)"
  53,38,that no bearer of burden will bear the burden of another
  53,39,and that there is nothing for man except that which he strives for
  53,40,and that his striving will be seen
  53,41,then he will be rewarded for it with a full reward
  53,42,and that towards your Fosterer is the (ultimate) goal
  53,43,and that it is He Who makes (one) laugh and makes (one) weep
  53,44,and that it is He Who gives death and gives life
