  37,25,“What is the matter with you that you do not help each other?”
  37,26,"No, they will seek submission on that day"
  37,27,and some of them will turn to others questioning each other
  37,28,"saying, “You certainly used to come to us from the right (with full force to mislead us).”"
  37,29,"(Others will) say, “No, you (only) did not believe"
  37,30,"and we had no authority on you, no, you were (yourselves)a rebellious people"
  37,31,"so the word of our Fosterer has proved true on us, we will certainly taste (the punishment)"
  37,32,we led you astray because we were ourselves astray.”
  37,33,So on that day they will be sharers in the punishment
  37,34,Thus do We deal with the criminals
  37,35,"When it was said to them, “There is no god except Allah,” they certainly used to consider themselves great (to accept this)"

  37,43,in gardens of bliss
  37,44,on couches facing each other
  37,45,A cup from a spring (of a drink) will be made to go round among them
  37,46,"white, delicious for the drinkers"
  37,47,There will be no unconsciousness due to it nor will they be intoxicated by it
  37,48,"And with them will be (females) who restrain their gaze, having beautiful eyes"
  37,49,as if they were protected eggs
