quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  42,45,"And you will see them being brought before the , humbled due to disgrace, looking secretly from the corners ( of their eyes ). And those who believe will say, “The losers are certainly those who are themselves at loss and their people ( too ), on the day of resurrection.” Beware ! those who are unjust will be in an eternal punishment"
  42,46,"And they will have no guardians to help them besides Allah, and He whom Allah leaves to stray, for him there is no way ( of safety)"
  42,47,"Respond to your Fosterer before the coming of the day from Allah, for which there is no turning back. On that day there will be no refuge for you nor will you have ( the power of ) rejection"
  42,48,"But if they turn away, then We have not sent you as a custodian over them, there is nothing ( incumbent ) on you except conveyance ( of the message ). And when We make man taste mercy from Us, he is exultant thereat, but when an evil afflicts them due to what their hands have sent forth, then man certainly becomes ungrateful ( forgetting the earlier good days)"
  42,49,"Allah’s is the kingdom of the skies and the earth. He creates what He wills, He grants females ( daughters ) to whom He wills and He grants males ( sons ) to whom He wills"
  42,50,"Or He pairs them ( by granting both ) males and females and He makes barren whom He wills. He is certainly Knowing, Powerful"
  42,51,"And it is not for a man that Allah should speak to him except ( through inspirational ) communication or from behind a veil or by sending a messenger who communicates by His permission what He wills, He is certainly High, Wise"
