quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,17,"Be patient on that which they say. And remember Our servant Dawood the possessor of power, he was certainly one turning (repentantly to Allah)"
  38,18,We had certainly subjected the mountains to glorify (Allah) with him in the evening and at sun rise
  38,19,"And the birds gathered, all returning to him"
  38,20,And We made his kingdom strong and We gave him wisdom and (the power of) decision of affairs
  38,21,"And has the news of the disputants come to you, when they climbed the wall of the private chamber"
  38,22,"when they entered before Dawood, and he was horrified of them? They said, “Do not fear, we are two disputants, one of us has wronged the other, so decide between us with justice and do not act unjustly and guide us to the balanced path"
  38,23,"This brother of mine, certainly has ninety and nine ewes and I have (only) one ewe, so he says: Entrust it to me; and shows his might on me in the affair.”"
  38,24,"He (Dawood) said, “He has been unjust to you by demanding your ewe (to be added) to his ewes and many of the partners certainly wrong one another, except those who believe and do righteous works, and their (number) is small.” And Dawood guessed that We had tested him, so he sought the protective forgiveness of his Fosterer and fell down bowing and turned (to Allah)"
  38,25,"So We protectively forgave him that, and certainly, with Us is nearness for him and a beautiful place of return"
  38,26,"O Dawood! We have made you a successor (to rule) in the earth so judge between mankind with justice and do not follow (your) desire lest it lead you astray from the way of Allah. Those who go astray from the way of Allah, for them there is certainly a severe punishment because they forgot the day of account"
