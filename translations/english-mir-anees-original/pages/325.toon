quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  21,36,"And when those who do not believe see you, they do not take you but as one to be mocked at (saying), \"Is this the one who mentions (about) your gods?\" And they, at the mention of the Beneficent (Allah), are rejecters"
  21,37,"Man has been created of haste . I will show you My signs, so do not ask Me to hasten"
  21,38,"And they say, \"When will this promise (come to pass) if you are truthful"
  21,39,Had those who do not believe but known the time when they will not be able to stop the fire from their faces and from their backs and they will not be helped (they would not have asked you such a question)
  21,40,"No! it will come on them suddenly so as to confound them, and they will not be able to turn it away and they will not be given time"
  21,41,"And messengers before you were mocked at, then that which they used to mock at, surrounded those of them who ridiculed. (R)"
  21,42,"Say, \"Who can guard you from the Beneficent (Allah) in the night and the day?\" No! they are the persons who turn away from the remembrance of their Fosterer"
  21,43,Or do they have gods besides Us who can guard them? They cannot help themselves nor can they be defended from Us
  21,44,No ! We gave provision to these and their fathers (too) till life lasted on them. Then do they not see that We give the earth its reduction from its borders? Will they then prevail
