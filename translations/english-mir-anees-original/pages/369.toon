quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,40,so that we may follow the magicians if they are the winners
  26,41,"So when the magicians came, they said to Firawn, \"Is there a sure reward for us if we are the winners"
  26,42,"He said, \"Yes, then you will certainly be of those who are near (to me)"
  26,43,"Musa said to them, \"Cast down what you are going to cast down"
  26,44,"So they cast down their ropes and their rods and said, \"By the might of Firawn we will certainly be winners"
  26,45,Then Musa cast down his staff when it swallowed that which they had falsely devised
  26,46,Consequently the magicians were thrown down prostrating
  26,47,"They said, \"We believe in the Fosterer of the worlds"
  26,48,Fosterer of Musa and Harun
  26,49,"He (Firawn) said, \"You believe in him before I give you permission, he is certainly your chief who taught you magic, but you will know, I will definitely cut off your hands and your feet from opposite sides and I will definitely crucify you all together"
  26,50,"They said, \"No harm, we will return to our Fosterer"
  26,51,"we certainly hope that our Fosterer will protectively forgive us our faults, because we are the first of the believers"
  26,52,"And We communicated to Musa that, \"Take away my servants by night, you will be pursued"
  26,53,So Firawn sent into the cities (his officials) who gathered (people)
  26,54,"(saying), \"They are certainly a small party"
  26,55,and they have angered us
  26,56,and we are an alert army
  26,57,Thus did We drive them out from gardens and springs
  26,58,and treasures and an honoured position
  26,59,Like that (it happened). And We made the children of Israel to inherit them
  26,60,So they pursued them at sunrise
