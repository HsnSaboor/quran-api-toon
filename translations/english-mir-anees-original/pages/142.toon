quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,111,"And even if We had sent down angels to them, and the dead had spoken to them, and We had gathered for them every thing in front of them, (even then) they would not believe unless Allah wills it, and the majority of them is ignorant"
  6,112,"And thus We have made for every prophet an enemy, devils (from among the) human beings and the jinn, some (of them) communicating to others (through) decoratively deceptive language, and had your Fosterer willed they would not have done it, so leave alone, them and that which they forge"
  6,113,"so that the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter may incline to it, and that they may be pleased with it and that they may earn that which they are going to earn"
  6,114,"Shall I then seek (as) a judge (someone) other than Allah, when He it is Who has sent down the book (law) to you detailing (judgment)? And those to whom We gave the book know that it has been sent down from your Fosterer, (and it) contains the truth, so do not be of those who doubt (it)"
  6,115,"And perfected is the word of your Fosterer in truth and justice. None can change His words and He is the Hearing, the Knowing"
  6,116,"And if you obey most of those who are in the earth, they will send you astray from the way of Allah, they follow nothing but conjecture and they do nothing but lie"
  6,117,"Your Fosterer certainly knows best, him who goes astray from His way, and He knows best those who are guided"
  6,118,So eat of that on which Allah's name has been mentioned if you are believers in His signs
