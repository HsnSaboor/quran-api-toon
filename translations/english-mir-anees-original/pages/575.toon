quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Your Fosterer certainly knows that you stand (for worship, salat) nearly two thirds of the night and (sometimes) half of it or one third of it along with a party of those with you, and Allah measures out the night and the day, He knows that you are not able to keep count of the (length of night), so He has turned to you (mercifully). Therefore recite as much of the Quran as may be easy for you. He knows that there will be (some who are) sick among you and others traveling in the earth seeking from Allah’s grace and (still) others fighting in the way of Allah. So recite as much of the (Quran) as may be easy (for you) and establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and loan to Allah a good loan. And whatever of good you send in advance for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, (and) it will be better and greater in reward (compared to your good deeds). And seek protective forgiveness from Allah, Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
  74,1,O you (who are) covered with cloth
  74,2,"Rise, then warn"
  74,3,and then (declare) the greatness of your Fosterer
  74,4,and then keep your clothes clean
  74,5,and then forsake uncleanliness
  74,6,and do not bestow favour (with the intention of) receiving more (in return)
  74,7,and then be patient for (the sake of) your Fosterer
  74,8,So (the day) when the trumpet will be sounded
  74,9,then that day will be the day of difficulty
  74,10,it will not be easy for the infidels
  74,11,Leave Me and him whom I created alone
  74,12,and assigned to him extensive wealth
  74,13,and sons who are witnessed (being always present before him)
  74,14,and made habitable for him (his) habitation
  74,15,(Even) then he hopes that I would give him more
  74,16,By no means ! he offers opposition to Our signs
  74,17,I will involve him in a severe punishment
