quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,"By the fig (or the place Tiin where Nuh’s ship embarked), and the olive (or Zaita in Jerusalam, were Isa-ibni-Maryam received and preached the message of Allah)"
  95,2,and Mount Sinai (where Musa received the message of Allah)
  95,3,"and this city of security (Mecca, where our prophet Muhammed initially received and preached the message of Allah, all these are witnesses that)"
  95,4,We had indeed created man in the best form
  95,5,then We brought him back as the lowest of those who are low
  95,6,"except those who believed and did righteous works, then for them there is an unfailing reward"
  95,7,Then after this what makes you deny the judgment
  95,8,"Is not Allah the Best Judge, of all the judges"
  96,1,Recite in the name of your Fosterer Who created
  96,2,He created man from something that clings and hangs (like a leech)
  96,3,"Recite, and your Fosterer is the Most Honourable"
  96,4,Who taught with the pen
  96,5,He taught man that which he did not know
  96,6,"No, man certainly rebels"
  96,7,because he sees himself independent
  96,8,"Certainly, towards your Fosterer is the return"
  96,9,Have you seen him who forbids
  96,10,when a servant of Allah worships
  96,11,"Have you seen, if he is on guidance"
  96,12,or enjoins guarding (against evil)
  96,13,"Have you seen, if he denies and turns (his back)"
  96,14,did he not know that Allah certainly sees
  96,15,"No, if he does not stop, We will drag him, seizing him by his forelock"
  96,16,"the denying, sinful forelock"
  96,17,So let him call his council
  96,18,We will call the soldiers (guards of hell)
  96,19,"No, do not obey him but prostrate and draw near (to Allah)"
