quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,Successful indeed are the believers
  23,2,Those who are humble during their worship (salat)
  23,3,and those who keep away from what is vain
  23,4,and those who are active in giving charity (zakat)
  23,5,and those who guard their private parts
  23,6,"except from their mates or those whom their right hands possess, then (in their case) they are certainly free of blame"
  23,7,"but whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the persons who transgress"
  23,8,and those who are keepers of their trusts and their agreements
  23,9,and those who guard their worship (salat)
  23,10,Those are the inheritors
  23,11,"who will inherit paradise, they will stay in it"
  23,12,And We have indeed created man from something taken out from clay
  23,13,Then We made it a sperm in a settling place
  23,14,"then We proportioned the sperm (into) that which clings and hangs like a leech, then We proportioned that which clings and hangs like a leech (into a thing like) chewed flesh, then We proportioned (the thing like) chewed flesh (into) bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, then We developed him in another creation. So blessed be Allah, the Best of Proportioners"
  23,15,Then after that you certainly die
  23,16,Then on the day of resurrection you will certainly be raised
  23,17,"And We have created seven paths above you, and We are not heedless of the creation"
