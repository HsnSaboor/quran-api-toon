quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,77,Do they not know that Allah knows that which they hide and that which they proclaim
  2,78,And among them are the unlettered who do not (even) know (what is written in) the book (their religion is nothing) but hearsay (idle tales or lies) and they do nothing but guess
  2,79,"Therefore, sorrowful is the state of those who write the book with their hands, then say, \"This is from Allah,\" so as to sell it for a small price. So sorrowful is their state for what their hands write and sorrowful is their state for what they earn"
  2,80,"And they say, \"The fire will not touch us except for a counted number of days.\" Say, \"Have you made an agreement with Allah? Then Allah never goes against His agreement. Or do you say about Allah that which you do not know"
  2,81,"Why not ! whoever earns evil and is encompassed by his misdeeds, then those are the inhabitants of the fire, they will stay in it"
  2,82,"And those who believe and do righteous works, those are the inhabitants of the garden, they will stay therein"
  2,83,"And when We took a pledge from the children of Israel, \"Do not serve anyone except Allah and be good to parents and relatives and orphans and the poor and talk to mankind in a nice manner and establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat),\" then you turned back except a few among you and you turned away"
