quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  22,47,"And how many a town is there to which I gave time (for amendment) while it was unjust, then I caught it and towards Me is the destination"
  22,48,"Say, \"O mankind! I am a clear warner to you"
  22,49,"So for those who believe and do righteous works, there is protective forgiveness and an honoured provision"
  22,50,"And those who strive against Our signs to defeat (them), those are the inhabitants of the hell fire"
  22,51,"And We did not send before you, any messenger or prophet, but when he desired (something) the devil put into his desire (some evil, as he normally does with human beings). Therefore Allah (first) wipes off that which the devil puts (into the desires of messengers and prophets and) then Allah establishes His signs (Divine communication), Allah is Knowing, Wise"
  22,52,"that He may make that which the devil puts in, a temptation for those in whose hearts is a disease and those whose hearts are hardened (and not for the messengers and prophets), and the unjust are certainly in deep opposition"
  22,53,"and that those who are given knowledge may know that the (Quran) is certainly the truth from your Fosterer (which has not been polluted in any way) so that they may believe therein and their hearts may humbly submit to Him. And Allah certainly guides those who believe, to the straight path"
  22,54,"And those who do not believe will not cease to be in doubt about it, till the hour of doom suddenly comes upon them or the punishment of the barren day comes upon them"
  22,55,"The kingdom on that day will be Allah's, He will judge between them. So those who believed and did righteous works will be in gardens of bliss"
