quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"But they denied him, so they certainly be presented (for punishment)"
  37,128,"except the servants, exclusively of Allah"
  37,129,"And We left on him, (the responsibility of conveying Our message) among others"
  37,130,Peace on Ilyaasiin
  37,131,Thus do We reward the doers of good
  37,132,He was certainly among Our believing servants
  37,133,And Lut was certainly from among Our messengers
  37,134,when We saved him and his followers all together
  37,135,except an old woman (who was) among those who remained behind
  37,136,then We destroyed the others
  37,137,And you certainly pass by their (ruins) during the day
  37,138,and during the night. Do you not then understand
  37,139,And Yunus was certainly from among Our messengers
  37,140,when he fled to the loaded ship
  37,141,then drew lots but was among those who were slipped off (from the ship)
  37,142,then the fish swallowed him and he was blameworthy
  37,143,And had he not been among those who glorify (Allah)
  37,144,he would have remained in its stomach till the day they are raised
  37,145,Then We cast him on the naked shore while he was sick
  37,146,and We caused a tree of gourd to grow over him
  37,147,And We sent him to more than a hundred thousand (people)
  37,148,"so they believed, therefore We made them enjoy till a time"
  37,149,"Then ask them, “Are there daughters for your Fosterer and for them sons"
  37,150,Or did We create the angels females while they were witnesses?”
  37,151,Is it not from their own devised falsehood that they say (that)
  37,152,Allah has a son? And they are certainly liars
  37,153,Has He chosen daughters (in preference to) sons
