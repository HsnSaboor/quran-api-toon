quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  7,164,"And when a community from among them said, \"Why do you admonish a people whom Allah would destroy or whom He would punish with a severe punishment?\" They said, \"(We admonish them so that) we may be free from blame (when we go back) to your Fosterer, (that we did our duty), and that they may guard (against evil)"
  7,165,"So when they forgot that with which they were reminded, We delivered those who forbade evil, and caught in an evil punishment, those who were unjust because they transgressed"
  7,166,"So when they revolted against that which they were forbidden, We said to them, \"Be apes, despised"
  7,167,"And (remember) when your Fosterer announced that towards the day of resurrection He will definitely raise against them one who would inflict them with an evil punishment, your Fosterer is certainly Quick in requiting and He is (also) Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
  7,168,"And We divided them in the earth (into) communities, of them (some) are righteous and of them (some) are other than that. And We tested them with good and evil that they may return (to the right path)"
  7,169,"Then successors who succeeded after them inherited the book, they accepted the apparent good of this low (life) and said, \"We will be forgiven.\" And if a similar apparent good (again) comes to them they would accept it. Was not a pledge taken from them (through) the book, that they should not say anything about Allah except the truth? And they read that which is in the (book). And the home of the hereafter is better for those who guard (against evil). Will you not then understand"
  7,170,"And those who hold fast by the book and establish worship (salat), We will certainly not waste the reward of the righteous"
