  16,35,"And those who associate partners (with Allah) say, “Had Allah willed we would not have served (worshipped) anything besides Him, we and our fathers; and we would not have made anything unlawful, besides Him*.” Those before them (also) did like that, so what (else is incumbent) on the messengers except clear conveyance (of the message)? * In addition to His making certain things unlawful"
