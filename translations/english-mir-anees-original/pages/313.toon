  20,15,"The hour of doom is certainly coming, I intend to keep it hidden, so that every soul may be rewarded according to the effort it puts in"
  20,16,"So do not let him who does not believe in it and follows his own desire, turn you away from it, lest you perish"
  20,17,And what is that in your right hand O Musa
  20,18,"He said \"This is my staff, I recline on it and I beat down the leaves with it for my sheep and there are other uses in it for me"
  20,19,"He said, \"Throw it down O Musa"
  20,20,So when he threw it down it became a moving snake
  20,21,"He said, \"Catch it and do not fear, We will return it to its original condition"

  20,26,and make easy for me my affair
  20,27,and loose the knot from my tongue
  20,28,(so that) they should understand what I say
  20,29,and appoint for me a minister from my family (to help me)
  20,30,Harun my brother
  20,31,and strengthen through him my back
  20,32,and make him my partner in my affair
  20,33,that we may glorify You much
  20,34,and remember (or mention) You much
  20,35,You certainly see us
  20,36,"He said, \"You are granted your request, O Musa"
  20,37,And We had bestowed a favour on you another time (earlier)
