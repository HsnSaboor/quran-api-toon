quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,1,Alif Laam Raa. There are the signs of the book of wisdom
  10,2,"Is it a wonder for mankind that We have communicated to a man from among them, that he should warn mankind and convey good news to those who believe, that for them is the true footing with their Fosterer? The infidels say, “This is certainly a clear magician.”"
  10,3,"Your Fosterer is certainly Allah Who created the skies and the earth in six periods, then He set the balance on the throne (of the universe), directing the affair. No mediator (can recommend) without (obtaining) His permission. That is Allah your Fosterer, so serve Him. Will you not then mind? without (obtaining) His permission. That is Allah your Fosterer, so serve Him. Will you not then mind"
  10,4,"To Him will be the return of all of you, the promise of Allah is true. He it is Who begins the creation, then gets it reproduced that He may reward with justice those who believe and do righteous works. And for those who do not believe, there will be a drink of hot water and a painful punishment, because they did not believe"
  10,5,He it is Who has made the sun self luminous and the moon radiant (reflecting the sun light) and programmed for it stages that you may know the number of years and (keep) the account. Allah did not create that but in reality. He explains the signs in detail for a people who have knowledge
  10,6,"In the alternation of the night and the day and (in) that which Allah has created in the skies and the earth, there are certainly signs for a people who guard (against evil)"
