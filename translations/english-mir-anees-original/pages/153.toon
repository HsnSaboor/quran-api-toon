  7,26,"O children of Adam ! We have sent down to you clothing for hiding your shame and for good appearance, and clothing that guards (against evil), that is the best. That is of the signs of Allah that they may be mindful"
  7,27,"O children of Adam ! do not let the devil tempt you as (he tempted and) got your parents (Adam and Hawwa driven) out of the garden, pulling off from both of them their clothing to show them their shame; he sees you, he and his tribe, from a place where you cannot see them. We have certainly made the devils friends of those who do not believe"

  7,30,"A party has He guided while (another) party, error is due on them (because) they have taken the devils as their friends besides Allah and they think that they are (rightly) guided"
