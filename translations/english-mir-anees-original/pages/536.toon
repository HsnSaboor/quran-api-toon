quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  56,51,Then all of you ! O you who err and deny
  56,52,you will eat from the tree of Zaqqum
  56,53,and fill your stomachs with it
  56,54,then over it you will drink from boiling water
  56,55,and you will drink (as) a thirsty camel drinks
  56,56,This will be their entertainment on the day of judgment
  56,57,"We have created you, then why do you not accept the truth"
  56,58,Have you seen (the sperm) which you emit
  56,59,Is it you who have created it or are We the Creators
  56,60,"We have destined death among you, and We are not to be overcome"
  56,61,"in changing your likeness and producing you in (a state), the knowledge of which you do not have"
  56,62,"And you indeed know the first creation, so why are you not mindful"
  56,63,Have you seen that which you sow
  56,64,Is it you who grow (the plants through) it or are We the Growers
  56,65,"Had We willed, We could have made it broken pieces, then you would start wondering"
  56,66,“We are (involved) in a lasting difficulty
  56,67,"no, we are deprived.”"
  56,68,Have you seen the water which you drink
  56,69,Is it you who send it down from the cloud or are We those Who send it down
  56,70,"Had We willed We could have made it bitter, so why are you not grateful"
  56,71,Have you seen the fire which you kindle
  56,72,Is it you who produce the tree for it or are We the Producers
  56,73,We have made it a reminder (probably of hell fire) and a provision for the needy (wayfarer)
  56,74,So glorify the name of your Great Fosterer
  56,75,So I do swear by the places of existence of the stars
  56,76,"and that certainly is a great oath, if you only knew"
