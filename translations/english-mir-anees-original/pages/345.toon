quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,43,No community can advance its term nor can it postpone it
  23,44,"Then We sent Our messengers one after another. Whenever its messenger came to a community, it denied him, so We made some of them to follow others and We made them stories, so away with the people who do not believe"
  23,45,Then We sent Musa and his brother Harun with Our signs and clear authority
  23,46,"to Firawn and the leaders of his (people), but they considered themselves great and they were a transgressing people"
  23,47,"So they said, \"Shall we believe in two men like us while (the people) of their community are our servants"
  23,48,"So they denied them, therefore they became of those who were destroyed"
  23,49,And We gave Musa the book that they may be guided
  23,50,"And We made the son of Maryam and his mother a sign; and for shelter We took them to a high place, with springs, (which was) meant for staying"
  23,51,"O you messengers! eat from the good things and do righteous work, I certainly know about that which you do"
  23,52,And this community of yours is certainly a single community and I am your Fosterer so fear Me
  23,53,"But they (their followers) divided their (religious) affairs among themselves (becoming different) sects, each party being happy with that which was with it"
  23,54,So leave them in their confused ignorance till a time
  23,55,Do they think that by Our helping them with wealth and sons
  23,56,We are hastening good things for them? No! they do not perceive
  23,57,Those who are afraid due to the fear of their Fosterer
  23,58,and those who believe in the signs of their Fosterer
  23,59,and those who do not associate partners with their Fosterer
