quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,158,"Do they wait for anything else than that the angels should come to them or your Fosterer should come or some signs of your Fosterer should come. The day some signs of your Fosterer come, the believing of a soul (anyone, after seeing the signs on that day) will not profit him who neither believed earlier nor earned good through his belief. Say, \"(All of you) wait, we too are certainly waiting"
  6,159,"Those who divide their religion and become sects, you have nothing to do with them in anything, their affair is only with Allah, later He will inform them of what they used to do"
  6,160,"Whoever comes with (one) good then (the reward) for him is ten (times) like it and whoever comes with (one) evil, he will be rewarded only with the like of it and they will not be dealt with unjustly"
  6,161,"Say, \"My Fosterer has certainly guided me to the straight path ( leading to ) the established religion (consisting of ) the religious dictates of Ibrahim the upright, and he was not of the polytheists"
  6,162,"Say, \"My worship (salat) and my sacrifice and my life and my death are for Allah, the Fosterer of the worlds"
  6,163,"He has no partner and this I am commanded, and I am the first of those who submit (as Muslims)"
  6,164,"Say, \"Shall I seek a fosterer other than Allah, when He is the Fosterer of everything? And every soul earns only against itself, and no bearer of a burden will bear the burden of another, then to your Fosterer will be your return, and He will inform you of that in which you differed"
  6,165,"And He it is Who made you successors of the earth, and raised the grades of some of you above others that He may test you through that which He has given you. Your Fosterer is certainly Quick in requiting while He is (also) Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
