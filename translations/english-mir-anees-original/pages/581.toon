quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Did We not create you from a fluid (which is) weakened after vigor
  77,21,Then We made it to stay in a place
  77,22,till (the fulfilment of) the known programme
  77,23,"thus We programmed, for We are Excellent Programmers"
  77,24,"Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers"
  77,25,"Did We not make the earth, one that draws together to itself"
  77,26,the living and the dead (due to the force of its gravity)
  77,27,And We made therein lofty ranges of mountains and gave you to drink sweet water
  77,28,"Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers"
  77,29,"(It will be said to them), “Proceed towards that which you used to deny"
  77,30,Proceed towards the covering having three branches
  77,31,neither (giving) cool shade nor making one free from the flame
  77,32,it certainly throws sparks like palaces
  77,33,as if they were yellow camels.”
  77,34,"Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers"
  77,35,This is the day (on which) they will not speak
  77,36,And permission will not be given to them that they may put forth excuses
  77,37,"Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers"
  77,38,"This is the day of decision, We have gathered you and the ancients"
  77,39,"So if there is any plot you have, then do plot against Me"
  77,40,"Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers"
  77,41,Those who had guarded (against evil) will be in shades and springs
  77,42,and fruits which they desire
  77,43,"(It will be said), “Eat and drink pleasantly because of that, which you used to do.”"
  77,44,Thus do We reward the doers of good
  77,45,"Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers"
  77,46,"Eat and enjoy yourselves for a while, you are certainly criminals"
  77,47,"Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers"
  77,48,"And when it is said to them to bow down, they do not bow down"
  77,49,"Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers"
  77,50,"Then in which statement after this, will they believe"
