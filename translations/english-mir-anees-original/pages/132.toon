quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,36,"Only those will respond, who listen. And the dead, Allah will raise them up, then to Him they will be returned"
  6,37,"And they say, \"Why has not a sign (miracle) been sent down on him from his Fosterer?\" Say, \"Allah certainly has the power to send down a sign but the majority of them does not know"
  6,38,"And there is not an animal in the earth nor a bird that flies on its two wings but they are communities (species) like that of yours, We have not neglected anything in the book, then they will be gathered towards their Fosterer"
  6,39,"And those who deny Our signs are deaf and dumb in darknesses. Whom Allah wills, He sends him astray, and whom He wills, He puts him on the straight path"
  6,40,"Say, \"Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah comes upon you or the hour of doom comes upon you, (then) will you pray (for help) to someone other than Allah, if you are truthful"
  6,41,"No ! you will pray to Him alone, then He will remove that for which you prayed to Him, if He wills, and you will forget those whom you used to associate as partners (with Allah)"
  6,42,"And We had sent (messengers) to communities before you, then We afflicted them with distress and harm that they might humble themselves"
  6,43,"Then why did they not humble themselves, when distress from Us came to them? On the contrary, their hearts hardened and the devil made fair seeming to them, that which they did"
  6,44,"So when they forgot that with which they were admonished, We opened for them the gates of everything, until, while they were rejoicing in that which was given to them, We suddenly caught them, so then they were in utter despair"
