quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  58,22,"You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the period hereafter, loving those who resist Allah and His messenger, even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their relatives (and friends). Those are the persons in whose hearts He has written down belief and has strengthened them with a spirit from Him. And He will make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, to stay therein, Allah pleased with them and they pleased with Him. Those are (the members of) the team of Allah. Beware ! (the members of) the team of Allah, they are the successful ones"
  59,1,"Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth glorifies Allah and He is the Mighty, the Wise"
  59,2,"He it is Who caused the driving out of those who did not believe from among the owners of the book, from their houses at the first gathering for exile. You did not expect that they will go out while they expected that their fortresses would defend them against Allah, but Allah came to them (to punish them) from a place which they could not (even) imagine, and He cast terror into their hearts so that their houses were ruined with their own hands and the hands of the believers, so learn a lesson O you who have insight"
  59,3,"And if Allah had not decreed exile for them He would have punished them in this world, and in the hereafter they will have the punishment of fire"
