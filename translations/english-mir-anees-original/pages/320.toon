quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  20,114,"So Highly Exalted is Allah the Real King. And do not be in haste with the Quran before its communication to you is completed, and say, \"My Fosterer! increase me in knowledge"
  20,115,"And We had indeed made an agreement with Adam earlier but he forgot, and We did not find determination in him. (R)"
  20,116,"And when We said to the angels, \"Bow down to Adam,\" they (all) bowed down, except Iblis, he refused"
  20,117,"Then We said, \"O Adam! this is certainly an enemy to you and your wife, so let him not drive you both out of the garden so that you face distress"
  20,118,It is certainly (ordained) for you that you will neither be hungry therein nor naked
  20,119,"and you will neither be thirsty therein nor be exposed to sun's rays, (because of plenty of food, drinks, clothes and the pleasant environment)"
  20,120,"But the devil whispered to him saying. \"O Adam! shall I lead you to the tree of eternity and a kingdom that has no downfall"
  20,121,"So they both ate from it, consequently their shame became manifest to them and they both began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden, and Adam disobeyed his Fosterer therefore he went astray"
  20,122,Then his Fosterer chose him and turned to him (mercifully) and guided him
  20,123,"He said, \"Go down from here both of you together, some of you (will be) enemies of others, but when guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, he will neither go astray nor face distress"
  20,124,"And whoever turns away from My reminder, then his life will certainly be miserable and We will raise him blind on the day of resurrection"
  20,125,"He will say, \"My Fosterer! why did you raise me blind when I was one with sight (in the life of the world)"
