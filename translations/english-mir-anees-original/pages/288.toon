quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,59,"And nothing prevents Us from sending the signs except that the ancients (too) denied them. And We gave to Samood, the she-camel which could be seen (clearly), but they were unjust to it (by killing it); and We do not send signs but (to cause) fear"
  17,60,"And (remember) when We said to you, “Your Fosterer certainly encompasses mankind.” And We did not make the vision which We showed you but a trial for mankind and (also) the cursed tree (mentioned) in the Quran, and We cause them to fear, but it increases them in nothing except a great rebellion"
  17,61,"And when We said to the angels, “Bow down to Adam,” they bowed down except Iblis, he said, “Shall I bow down to him whom You created (of) clay?”"
  17,62,"He (Iblis) said, “Do you see the (person) whom You have honored above me? If You give me time till the day of resurrection I will definitely bring his descendants under my control (all) but a few.”"
  17,63,"He (Allah) said, “Go, and whoever follows you from among them, then hell will certainly be your reward, an ample reward"
  17,64,"And upset and dislodge with your voice whom you can from among them, and collect (your forces) against them (to attack them riding) on your horse and (marching on) your foot (that is, all means at your disposal), and have a share with them in their wealth and children making promises to them. And the devil promises them nothing but deceit"
  17,65,You certainly have no authority on My servants and your Fosterer is sufficient (as) a Trustee.”
  17,66,"Your Fosterer is He Who makes the ships to sail in the sea for you that you may seek from His grace, He is certainly Merciful to you"
