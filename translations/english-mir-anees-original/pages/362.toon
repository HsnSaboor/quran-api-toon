  25,22,"The day they will see the angels, on that day it will not be a good news for the criminals, and they will say, \"(May we be) prevented (from that through some) prevention"
  25,23,"And We will turn to the work which they did, then We will make it as scattered dust"
  25,24,"On that day the place/time of stay of the inhabitants of the garden will be good, and their resting place the best"
  25,25,"And on that day the sky will be split with the clouds (coverings) and the angels will be sent down, descending"
  25,26,"The kingdom on that day, as a right, will be of the Beneficent (Allah), and the day will be difficult for the infidels"
  25,27,"And on that day the unjust will bite his hands saying, \"I wish I had taken a way with the messenger"
  25,28,"O sorrowful is my state, I wish I had not taken such a one as a friend"
  25,29,"he has misled me from the reminder after it had come to me, and the devil is a traitor for man"

  25,31,"And thus did We make for every prophet, an enemy from among the criminals, and your Fosterer is sufficient as a Guide and a Helper"
  25,32,"And those who do not believe say, \"Why has not the whole Quran been sent down on him all at once?\" Thus (We have not sent it down all at once) that We may make your heart firm through it, and (therefore) We have caused the Quran to be recited to you gradually (in portions, after) intervals"
