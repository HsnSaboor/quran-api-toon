quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  9,1,A declaration of immunity* from Allah and His messenger to those of the polytheists with whom you made an agreement. * Freedom from obligation
  9,2,"So move about (unrestricted) in the land for (another) four months, and know that you cannot frustrate Allah, and Allah will certainly disgrace the infidels"
  9,3,"And an announcement from Allah and His messenger to mankind on the day of the great pilgrimage that Allah and His messenger are free from obligation to the polytheists, so if you repent it will be better for you and if you turn back then know that you cannot frustrate Allah, and convey the news of a painful punishment to those who do not believe"
  9,4,"except those of the polytheists with whom you made an agreement then they did not go back in anything (of the agreement) nor did they help anyone against you, so fulfill for them their agreement till the completion of their term. Allah certainly loves those who guard (against evil)"
  9,5,"Then when the sacred months pass off, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and catch them and imprison them and sit for them at every place where you can watchfully wait (for them). But if they repent and establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) then leave their way free. Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
  9,6,"And if anyone of the polytheists seeks your protection then give him protection to the extent that he hears the word of Allah, then make him reach his (place of) safety. That is because they are a people who do not know"
