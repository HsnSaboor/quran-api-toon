quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,62,"They swear to you by Allah (just) to please you, but Allah, with His messenger, has a greater right that they should please Him if they are believers"
  9,63,"Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His messenger, then for him there is the fire of hell, he will stay in it? That is a great disgrace"
  9,64,"The hypocrites are afraid lest a chapter (of the Quran) be sent down about them informing them of that which is in their hearts. Say, \"Mock ! Allah will certainly bring out that which you are afraid of"
  9,65,"And if you ask them they will definitely say, \"We were only talking idly and sporting.\" Say, \"Was it at Allah and His signs and His messenger that you were mocking"
  9,66,"Do not make any excuse, you did reject after your belief. If We pardon a group from among you We will punish (the other) group because they were criminals"
  9,67,"The hypocrite men and the hypocrite women, they resemble each other. They enjoin that which is not recognised (as good) and stop (people) from recognised good and withhold their hands. They have forgotten Allah so (Allah too) has forgotten them. The hypocrites, they certainly are the transgressors"
  9,68,"Allah has promised the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women and the infidels, fire of hell, they will stay therein, that is sufficient for them and Allah has cursed them and for them there is an eternal punishment"
