  29,56,"O my servants who believe! My earth is certainly vast, so serve Me alone"
  29,57,"Every soul tastes death, then you will be returned to Us"
  29,58,"And those who believe and do righteous works, they will definitely be settled by Us in high places in a garden beneath which rivers flow, they will stay therein, an excellent reward for those who work (for it)"

  29,62,"Allah enlarges the provision for whom He wills of His servants and straitens it, for whomever (and whenever He wills), and Allah is certainly the Knower of everything"
  29,63,"And if you ask them, “Who sends down the water from the sky then gives life through it to the earth after its death?” They will definitely say, “Allah.” Say, “Praise is due only for Allah, but the majority of them does not understand.”"
