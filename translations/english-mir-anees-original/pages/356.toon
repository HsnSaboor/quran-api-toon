quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,44,"Allah causes the oscillation of the night and the day, in that there is certainly a lesson for those who have insight"
  24,45,"And Allah created every moving creature from water, so among them is one that moves on its stomach and among them is one that walks on its two feet and among them is one that walks on four (legs). Allah creates what He wills, Allah certainly has power over everything"
  24,46,"We have indeed sent down clear signs, and Allah guides whom He wills to the straight path"
  24,47,"And they say, \"We believe in Allah and in the messenger and we will obey,\" then a party from among them turns away after that (commitment), and those are not with the believers"
  24,48,"And when they are invited towards Allah and His messenger that he may judge between them, then a party from among them turns away"
  24,49,"And if the right (that is due to them) is on their side, they come to him being fast in obedience"
  24,50,"Is there a disease in their hearts or are they in doubt or do they fear that Allah and His messenger will act with prejudice against them, no, they themselves are the unjust"
  24,51,"The statement of the believers, when they are invited towards Allah and His messenger that He may judge between them, is only that they say, \"We have heard and we obey,\" and those are the successful persons"
  24,52,"And one who obeys Allah and His messenger and fears Allah being careful of Him, then those are the persons who are achievers (of success)"
  24,53,"And they swear by Allah their strongest oaths, that if you command them they will definitely go out (to fight in the cause of Allah). Say, “Do not swear, recognized obedience (is required of you), Allah is certainly informed of that which you do"
