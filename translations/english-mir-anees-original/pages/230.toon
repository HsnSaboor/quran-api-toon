And (he knew, that) earlier (too) they used to do evil things, (therefore) he said, “O my people ! these are my daughters, they are cleaner for you (if you marry them), so fear Allah and do not disgrace me with regard to my guests, is there not (even a single) right minded man among you?”"

Certainly, their promised time is the morning. Is not the morn near?”"
