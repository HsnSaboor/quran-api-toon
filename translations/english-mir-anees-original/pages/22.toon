quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,142,"The foolish among the people will say, \"What has turned them from their Qiblah * towards which they used to (face)?\" say \"The east and the west are Allah's, He guides whom He wills, towards the straight path.\" *Direction in which Muslims are required to face during Worship (salat)"
  2,143,"And thus We have made you a middle community (probably with respect to location and time) that you may be witnesses (by keeping an eye) on mankind and the messenger may be a witness ( by keeping an eye) on you. And We had appointed the Qiblah, towards which you used to (turn earlier), only to know (distinguish) one who follows the messenger, from one who turns away on his heels. And that was a great (test) except for those whom Allah had guided, and Allah will not waste your belief, Allah is certainly full of pity for human beings, Merciful"
  2,144,"We have surely seen you turning your face towards the sky, therefore We will definitely turn you towards the Qiblah with which you are pleased. So turn your face towards the direction of the Sacred Mosque (Kaaba) and wherever you are then turn your faces in that direction. And those who have been given the book, certainly know that this is the truth from their Fosterer, and Allah is not unaware of what they do"
  2,145,"And even if you come with all signs, to those who have been given the book, they will not follow your Qiblah, nor will you be the followers of their Qiblah, nor some of them will be the followers of the Qiblah of others. And if you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, then you would certainly be of those who are unjust"
