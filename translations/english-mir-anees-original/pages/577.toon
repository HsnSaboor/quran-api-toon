quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,So the mediation of mediators will not be of benefit to them
  74,49,So what is (wrong) with them that they turn away from the reminder
  74,50,as if they are frightened asses
  74,51,fleeing from a lion
  74,52,"No, every man from among them desires that he should be given open pages"
  74,53,"No, they do not fear the hereafter"
  74,54,"No, it is certainly a reminder"
  74,55,so whoever wills may mind it
  74,56,"and they do not mind unless Allah wills, He is worthy to be feared and capable to be Protectively Forgiving"
  75,1,"No, I do swear by the day of resurrection"
  75,2,"no,! and I do swear by the self-accusing soul (the conscience)"
  75,3,Does man think that We will not gather his bones
  75,4,Why not! We are able to put in order his very finger tips
  75,5,"No, man intends to exceed the limits (set) before him"
  75,6,"He asks, “When is the day of resurrection?”"
  75,7,"(It will be) then, when the sight will be dazzled"
  75,8,and the moon will sink
  75,9,when the sun and the moon will be brought together
  75,10,"Man will say on that day, “Where is the place to flee?”"
  75,11,By no means ! (there is) no place of refuge
  75,12,"The only place to stay on that day, will be near your Fosterer"
  75,13,Man will be informed on that day about what he had sent before him (preferred) and what he had put (behind his) back (i.e. he will be informed of his priorities)
  75,14,"No, man will be a witness against his own soul"
  75,15,though he will put forward his excuses
  75,16,(While reciting the Quran) do not move your tongue (fast) with it (so as to) make haste with it
  75,17,"(The responsibility of) collecting it and reciting it, is certainly on Us"
  75,18,"Therefore when We recite it, then follow its recitation"
  75,19,"Then (the responsibility of) its explanation (too), is certainly on Us"
