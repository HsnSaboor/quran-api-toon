quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  4,34,"Men are established over women because of that in which Allah has been (more) gracious to some (men), compared to others (women), and because of that which the (men) spend from their wealth; therefore the righteous women are obedient, guardians of the unseen (their chastity in all respects), which Allah (orders that it should be) guarded. And as for those (women) from whom you fear confrontation, admonish them and leave them alone in their sleeping places and strike them (by word or action) then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them, Allah is certainly High, Great"
  4,35,"And if you are afraid of a split between the (husband and wife) then appoint a judge from his people and a judge from her people, if they intend reconciliation, Allah will effect reconciliation between them, Allah is certainly Knowing, Informed"
  4,36,"And serve Allah and do not associate anything with Him as a partner, and be good to parents and to the relatives and the orphans and the needy and the neighbor who is related and the neighbor who is strange (not related) and the companion by your side and the wayfarer and (slaves) whom your right hands possess; Allah certainly does not like him who is proud, boastful"
  4,37,"those who hoard (their wealth being miserly) and enjoin (other) people (also) to hoard, and hide that which Allah has given them of His grace, and We have prepared a disgraceful punishment for the infidels"
