quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  36,13,"And set forth to them the similitude of the inhabitants of the town, when messengers came to it"
  36,14,"when We sent to them two, they denied them both, therefore We strengthened (them) with a third, so they said, “We are messengers (sent) to you.”"
  36,15,"They said, “You are nothing but men like us and the Beneficent (Allah) has not sent down anything, you do nothing but lie.”"
  36,16,"They said, “Our Fosterer knows that we are certainly messengers (sent) to you"
  36,17,and there is no (responsibility) on us except clear conveyance (of the message).”
  36,18,"They said, “We consider you to be an evil omen, if you do not desist we will definitely stone you and you will definitely be afflicted by a painful punishment from us.”"
  36,19,"They said, “(Let) your evil omens be with you. What! (you resist us just) because you are reminded, no, you are an extravagant people.”"
  36,20,"And a man came running from a distant (part) of the city, he said, “O my people! follow the messengers"
  36,21,follow those who do not ask you for a reward and who are themselves guided
  36,22,"And what reason do I have not to serve Him Who initiated my creation, and to Him you will be returned"
  36,23,"What! should I take gods besides Him, whose recommendation will not make me free from anything, if the Beneficent (Allah) intends harm, nor will they save me"
  36,24,"Then, in that case, I will certainly be in clear error"
  36,25,"I have believed in your Fosterer, so listen to me.”"
  36,26,"It was said, “Enter the garden.” He said, “I wish my people could know"
  36,27,(the reason) because of which my Fosterer protectively forgave me and placed me among the honoured ones.”
