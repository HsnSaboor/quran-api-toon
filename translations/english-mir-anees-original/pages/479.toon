quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  41,21,"And they will say to their skins, “Why did you bear witness against us?” They will say, “Allah, Who gives speech to everything, has given us speech.” And He created you the first time and to Him you will be returned"
  41,22,"And you did not hide yourselves lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should bear witness against you, but you guessed that Allah did not know many of ( the things ) which you did"
  41,23,"And that guess of yours which you guessed about your Fosterer destroyed you, so you became of those at loss"
  41,24,"So if they are patient ( even ) then the fire is the home for them, and if they seek goodwill, then they will not be of those who will be granted goodwill"
  41,25,"And We have appointed comrades for them, so they make fair seeming to them that which is before them ( future ) and that which is behind them . And the word has proved true against them, ( as ) among the communities of the jinn and mankind that have passed away before them, ( that ) they will certainly be losers"
  41,26,"And those who do not believe say, “Do not listen to this Quran and make noise when it is , perhaps you may be victorious.”"
  41,27,"So We will definitely make those who do not believe, taste a severe punishment, and We will definitely reward them for the evil ( things ) which they used to do"
  41,28,"That is the reward of the enemies of Allah, the fire, for them therein is an eternal home, a reward for that which they did with Our signs: ( They ) knowingly rejected ( them)"
  41,29,"And those who had not believed will say, “Our Fosterer ! show us those who misled us from among the jinn and the human beings that we may place them beneath our feet, so that they may be of the lowest.”"
