  12,54,"And the king said, “Bring him to me, I will appoint him exclusively for myself.” Then when he talked to him, he (the king) said, “This day you are certainly established (as) a trustworthy (in charge) by us.”"
  12,55,"He (Yusuf) said, “Appoint me (as an In charge) over the warehouses of the land, I am certainly a custodian who knows.”"
  12,56,And thus did We establish Yusuf in the land to dwell in it wherever he willed. We send down Our mercy on whom We will and We do not waste the reward of the doers of good
  12,57,and the reward of the hereafter is certainly better for those who believe and guard (against evil)

  12,59,"And when they were provided with their provision he said, “Bring to me your brother from your father. Do you not see that I give full measure and I am one among good hosts"

  12,61,"They said, “We will try to get him from his father, we will certainly do (it).”"
  12,62,"And he (Yusuf) said to his servants, “Place their merchandise in their bags so that they may recognise it when they go back to their people and thereby return (to me).”"
  12,63,"So when they returned to their father, they said, “O our father ! the measure (of provision) will be withheld from us, therefore send our brother with us so that we may get the measure (of provision) and we will certainly be his protectors.”"
