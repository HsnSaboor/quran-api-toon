quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,and assign for me a true mention among later (generations)
  26,85,and place me among the inheritors of the garden of bliss
  26,86,"and protectively forgive my father, he is certainly among those who are astray"
  26,87,and do not disgrace me on the day they are raised (again)
  26,88,the day on which neither wealth nor sons will benefit
  26,89,except him who comes to Allah with a pure heart
  26,90,And the garden will be brought near for those who guard (against evil)
  26,91,And the hell will be made manifest to the erring ones
  26,92,"And it will be said to them, \"Where are those whom you used to worship"
  26,93,besides Allah? Can they help you or help themselves
  26,94,"Then they will be thrown headlong into it, they and the misleaders"
  26,95,"and the army of Iblis (devil), all together"
  26,96,They will say while they quarrel therein
  26,97,"By Allah, we were certainly in clear error"
  26,98,when we considered you equal to the Fosterer of the worlds
  26,99,and no one has misled us except the criminals
  26,100,so we have no mediators
  26,101,and no intimate friend
  26,102,"So if we are given (another chance to) return (to the world), then we will certainly be of those who believe"
  26,103,"There is certainly a sign in that, but the majority of them does not believe"
  26,104,"And your Fosterer, He is certainly the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,105,The people of Nuh denied the messengers
  26,106,"when their brother Nuh said to them, \"Will you not guard (against evil)"
  26,107,I am certainly a trustworthy messenger to you
  26,108,so fear Allah and obey me
  26,109,"and l do not ask you for any reward for it, my reward is with none but the Fosterer of the worlds"
  26,110,so fear Allah and obey me
  26,111,"They said, \"Shall we believe in you when the worst (people) follow you"
