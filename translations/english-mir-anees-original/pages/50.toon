quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,1,Alif Laam Miim
  3,2,"Allah, there is no god except Him, the Living, the Eternally Existing"
  3,3,"He has sent down on you the book containing the truth, confirming that which was before it. And He had sent down the Torah and the Injeel"
  3,4,"before, for the guidance of human beings. And He has sent down the distinction (between right and wrong, the Quran). Those who do not believe in the signs of Allah, for them there is certainly a severe punishment, and Allah is Mighty, the Inflictor of retribution"
  3,5,"Certainly, nothing is hidden from Allah in the earth or in the sky"
  3,6,"He it is Who gives you form in the wombs, as He wills, there is no god except Him, the Mighty, the Wise"
  3,7,"He it is Who has sent down the book to you, in it are statements which are decisive, they are the basis of the book and others are allegorical. So those in whose hearts is (a desire for) deviation from the right, they follow that which is allegorical in it, seeking to mislead and seeking to interpret it, and no one knows its interpretation except Allah; and those sound in knowledge say, “We believe in it, all is from our Fosterer, and no one minds except those who have understanding"
  3,8,"Our Fosterer ! do not let our hearts deviate from the right after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You, You are the One Who grants"
  3,9,"Our Fosterer ! one day You will gather (all) human beings, there is no doubt in it, Allah certainly does not go against (His) promise.”"
