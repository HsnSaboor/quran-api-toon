quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  32,12,"And if you (could only) see, when the criminals would bow down their heads before their Fosterer (pleading), “Our Fosterer! we have seen and heard, so send us back we will do righteous work, (now) we are certain.”"
  32,13,"And had We willed We could have guided every soul, but the word from Me that, “I will fill hell with the jinn and human beings together,” will be (proved) true"
  32,14,"So taste (the punishment), because you forgot the meeting of this day of yours We (too) will forget you. And taste the everlasting punishment because of that which you used to do"
  32,15,"Only those believe in Our signs who, when they are reminded through them, fall down prostrate and glorify by praising their Fosterer and they do not consider themselves great"
  32,16,"Their sides keep away from their beds, they pray to their Fosterer in fear and in hope and they spend from that which We have provided them"
  32,17,"So no soul knows what is hidden from it, of (that which) comforts the eye, (as a) reward for that which they used to do"
  32,18,"Then, is he who is a believer, like him who is a transgressor? They are not equal"
  32,19,"As for those who believe and do righteous works, for them are gardens as (their) settling place, a gift for what they used to do"
  32,20,"And as for those who transgress, their settling place is the fire, whenever they will intend to come out of it, they will be returned into it and it will be said to them, “Taste the punishment of the fire which you used to deny.”"
