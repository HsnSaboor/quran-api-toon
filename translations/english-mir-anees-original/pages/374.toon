quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,The people of Lut denied the messengers
  26,161,"when their brother Lut said to them, \"Will you not guard (against evil)"
  26,162,I am certainly a trustworthy messenger to you
  26,163,so fear Allah and obey me
  26,164,"and I do not ask you for any reward for it, my reward is with none but the Fosterer of the worlds"
  26,165,What! of all creatures you approach males
  26,166,"and leave those of your wives whom your Fosterer has created for you? No, you are a transgressing people"
  26,167,"They said, \"If you do not desist, O Lut! you will definitely be of those who are driven out"
  26,168,"He said, \"I am certainly of those who hate your acts"
  26,169,My Fosterer ! deliver me and my followers from that which they do
  26,170,So We delivered him and his followers all together
  26,171,"except an old woman, (who was) among those who remained behind"
  26,172,Then We destroyed the others
  26,173,"and We rained on them a rain, so evil was the rain of those who were warned"
  26,174,"There is certainly a sign in that, but the majority of them does not believe"
  26,175,"And your Fosterer, He is certainly the Mighty, the Merciful (R)"
  26,176,The inhabitants of the jungle denied the messengers
  26,177,"when Shuaib said to them, \"Will you not guard (against evil)"
  26,178,I am certainly a trustworthy messenger to you
  26,179,so fear Allah and obey me
  26,180,"and I do not ask you for any reward for it, my reward is with none but the Fosterer of the worlds"
  26,181,Give back full measure and do not be of those who cause loss
  26,182,And weigh with a balance that is straight (correct)
  26,183,"and do not give less to people, the things due to them, and do not cause disturbance in the earth being corrupt"
