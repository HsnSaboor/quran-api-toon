  16,111,"(One) day every soul will come pleading for itself, and every soul will be paid back in full (for) that which it did and they will not be dealt with unjustly"
  16,112,"And Allah sets forth a similitude of a town (which was) secure, peaceful, its provision coming to it in abundance from every place, then it became ungrateful to Allah’s favors, so Allah made it taste the confusion of hunger and fear because of the (evil) they used to do"

  16,115,"He has forbidden for you only: the dead and blood and flesh of swine and that over which (a name) other than that of Allah has been invoked, but one who is driven to necessity (being helplessly forced to eat) neither desiring it nor revolting, then Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
  16,116,"And do not say regarding (anything) which is (based just on) the false utterances of your tongues, “This is lawful and this is unlawful,” so as to forge (a lie) against Allah, those who forge a lie against Allah will certainly not be successful"
