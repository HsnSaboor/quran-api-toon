quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,103,"And We indeed know that they say, “Only a man teaches him.” The language of the person towards whom they incline (doubting that he teaches the messenger of Allah) is foreign and this is clear Arabic language"
  16,104,"Those who do not believe in the signs of Allah, Allah will certainly not guide them for them and there is a painful punishment"
  16,105,"Only they who do not believe in the signs of Allah, forge falsehood and those are the persons who are liars"
  16,106,"He who does not believe in Allah after his having believed (in Him), except he who is compelled while his heart is peaceful with belief, but he who opens (his) bosom for infidelity, then on them is anger from Allah and for them there is a great punishment"
  16,107,That is because they love the life of this world more than the hereafter and because Allah does not guide a people who are infidels
  16,108,Those are the persons on whose hearts and their hearing and their eyes Allah has set a seal and those are the persons who are heedless
  16,109,"Assuredly, they will be the persons who will be at loss in the hereafter"
  16,110,"Then certainly your Fosterer, for those who migrated after they are persecuted then struggled and were patient, your Fosterer, after that, is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
