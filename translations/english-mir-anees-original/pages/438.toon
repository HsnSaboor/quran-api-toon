quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  35,31,"And that which we have communicated to you of the books, is the truth confirming (the book) which were before it. Allah is certainly informed of His servants, Seeing (them)"
  35,32,"Then We made those to inherit the book, whom We chose from among Our servants. So among them are those who are unjust to their own souls and among them are those who are moderate and among them are those who are foremost in good deeds by the order of Allah, that is the great grace (of Allah)"
  35,33,"gardens of everlasting bliss which they will enter, they will be made to wear therein bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments therein will be (of) silk"
  35,34,"And they will say, “Praise is due only for Allah Who has removed grief from us, Our Fosterer is certainly Protectively Forgiving, One Who acknowledges"
  35,35,"Who has made us alight in an eternal home out of His grace, neither toil will touch us therein nor will fatigue touch us therein.”"
  35,36,"And those who do not believe, for them is the fire of hell, it will neither bring the end of them that they may die, nor (something) of its punishment be lightened on them, thus will We reward every infidel"
  35,37,"And therein they will cry for help, “Our Fosterer! take us out, we will do righteous work, other than that which we used to do.” (They will be answered). “ Did We not keep you alive to the extent that he who wanted to be mindful in it could have been mindful? And the warner (too) came to you, so taste (the penalty), and for those who are unjust there is no helper.”"
  35,38,"Allah is certainly the Knower of the unseen of the skies and the earth, He is certainly the Knower of that which is in the bosoms"
