quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  10,43,And of them are those who look at you. But can you show the way to the blind when they are not (in a position to) see
  10,44,Allah is certainly not unjust to human beings in anything but human beings are unjust to themselves
  10,45,"And the day on which He will gather them, it will be as if they did not stay (in the earth) except for a part of a day, they will recognise each other. Those who denied the meeting with Allah and were not guided, will be at a loss"
  10,46,"And whether We show you a part of that which We promise them or take you back (i.e. cause you to die before that), ultimately their return is to Us; then (even after you) Allah will be a Witness over that which they do"
  10,47,"And for every community there was a messenger, so when their messenger came to them (their affair was) decided between them with justice and they were not dealt with unjustly"
  10,48,"And they say, “When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are truthful.”"
  10,49,"Say, “I do not have power (even to) harm or benefit myself (I have nothing) except that which Allah wills For every community there is a (fixed) term, when their term comes (to an end), then they can neither postpone it for (some) time nor advance it.”"
  10,50,"Say, “Do you see, whether His punishment comes to you by night or by day, what is there of it, which the criminals wish to hasten"
  10,51,"Then will you believe in it (only) when it has befallen? What ! now (you believe) and (earlier, not believing in it) you had wished for its hastening.”"
  10,52,"Then it will be said to those who were unjust, “Taste the punishment that stays. Will you be rewarded for something other than that which you used to earn?”"
  10,53,"And they ask you to inform them, “Is that true?” Say, “Yes! and by my Fosterer, it is certainly true and you cannot defeat (the truth).”"
