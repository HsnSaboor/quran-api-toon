quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,30,"And when your Fosterer said to the angels , \"I am going to make a successor in the earth.\" They said, \"Are you going to make (him, the successor) in it, who would act corruptly in it and shed blood, when we glorify You by praising You and exalt Your Holiness?\" He (Allah) replied, \"I know that which you do not know"
  2,31,"And He taught Adam all names $, then He presented them (things) before the angels and said, \"Inform Me of the names of these if you are right (in your objection to Adam being made the successor on earth).\" $ A name normally indicates the purpose or use of a thing"
  2,32,"They (angels) replied, \"Glory be to You, we do not have knowledge except of that which You taught us. You are certainly the Knowing, the Wise"
  2,33,"He (Allah) said, \"O Adam ! inform them of the names of these (things),\" so when the (angels) were informed of the names of those (things), He said, \"Did I not tell you, that I know the unseen of the skies and the earth and I know that which you manifest and that which you hide?\" which you manifest and that which you hide"
  2,34,"And when We (Allah) said to the angels, \"Bow down before Adam,\" they bowed own except Iblis*, he refused and considered himself great and (thus) became one of the infidels. * The devil associated with Adam"
  2,35,"And We said, \"O Adam ! you and your wife, dwell in the garden, and eat from it freely (from) wherever you will, but do not go near this tree, because you will become one of those who are unjust"
  2,36,"But the devil made them slip from it and caused them both to be sent out from that (state) in which they were. And We said, \"Go down, some of you will be the enemies of others, and in the earth is the dwelling place for you and provision till a time"
  2,37,"Then Adam received (some) words from his Fosterer, because He turned towards him (mercifully), He is certainly the Accepter of repentance, the Merciful"
