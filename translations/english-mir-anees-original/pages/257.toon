quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  14,11,"Their messengers said to them, “We are (of course) nothing but men like you but Allah bestows (his) favour on whom He wills of His servants, and it is not possible for us to come to you with an authority without the permission of Allah, and therefore, let the believers put their trust in Allah"
  14,12,"And what (reason) have we that we should not put our trust in Allah when He has guided us to our ways? And we will definitely be patient on the harm which you do to us, and therefore, let those who trust, put their trust in Allah.”"
  14,13,"And those who did not believe said to their messengers, “We will definitely drive you out from our land or else you should return to our religious dictates.” So their Fosterer communicated to them, “We will definitely destroy the unjust"
  14,14,and We will definitely make you dwell in the land after them.” That’s for him who fears standing before Me and fears My threat
  14,15,"And the (messengers) sought for victory, so every compelling opponent was defeated"
  14,16,Hell is before him and he will be made to drink from boiling water
  14,17,"He will drink it little by little but he will not be able to swallow it, and death will come to him from every place yet he will not die, and before him there will be a harsh punishment"
  14,18,"The likeness of those who do not believe in their Fosterer (is like those) whose works will be like ashes on which the wind blows hard on a stormy day. They will not have power on anything of that which they earned. That (in fact), will be going far astray (from success)"
