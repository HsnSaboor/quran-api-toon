quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  18,5,"Neither they have any knowledge of it nor their fathers (had). (It is a) grievous word that comes out of their mouths, they speak nothing but a lie"
  18,6,"If they do not believe in this statement, then perhaps you will kill yourself with grief, sorrowing after them"
  18,7,"We have made that which is on the earth an adornment for it, so that We may test them as to which of them is best in conduct"
  18,8,"And We will make that which is on it, a barren ground"
  18,9,Or do you think that the companions of the cave and the inscription were a wonder from among Our signs
  18,10,"when the young men sought refuge in the cave and said, “Our Fosterer! give us mercy from Yourself and shape for us the right way in our affair?”"
  18,11,"So We prevented them from hearing (and kept them sleeping) in the cave, for a number of years"
  18,12,Then We raised them up that We might know (mark out) which of the two parties was better at calculating the time for which they stayed
  18,13,"We narrate to you their news in truth, they were young men (who) believed in their Fosterer, and We increased them in guidance"
  18,14,"and We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and said, “Our Fosterer is the Fosterer of the skies and the earth, we will never pray to any god besides Him, for then we would have indeed said something far away from truth"
  18,15,"These our people have taken gods besides Him, why do they do not bring clear authority (in support) for them? So who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah"
