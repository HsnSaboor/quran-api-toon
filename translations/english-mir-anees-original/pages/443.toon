quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,And a sign for them is that We carried their progeny in the loaded ship
  36,42,"And We created for them (vessels) similar to it, on which they ride"
  36,43,"And if We will We can drown them, then there will be no one (to respond) to their cry for help nor will they be saved"
  36,44,"but (if this does not happen, it is due to) the mercy from Us and a provision till a time"
  36,45,"And (they are heedless) when it is said to them, “Guard (yourselves against) that which is before you and that which is behind you that you may be dealt with mercifully.”"
  36,46,And there does not come to them any sign from the signs of their Fosterer but they turn away from it
  36,47,"And when it is said to them, “Spend from that which Allah has provided for you,” those who do not believe say to those who believe, “Should we feed him, whom Allah (Himself) could feed, if He wills? You are in nothing but clear error.”"
  36,48,"And they say, “When will the promise (be fulfilled) if you are truthful?”"
  36,49,They do not wait for anything but a single loud cry which will take hold of them while they are (involved) in a tussle with each other
  36,50,so that they will neither be able to make a bequest nor will they be able to return to their own people
  36,51,And it will be blown into the trumpet (structure of the universe) when they will rush forth from their graves towards their Fosterer
  36,52,"saying, “Sorrowful is our state, who has raised us from our sleeping place? This is what the Beneficent (Allah) had promised and the messengers had spoken the truth.”"
  36,53,It will be nothing but a single loud cry when all of them will be presented before Us
  36,54,"So on that day, no soul will be dealt with unjustly in anything and you will not be rewarded for anything but for that which you used to do"
