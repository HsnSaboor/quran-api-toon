quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,225,"Allah will not catch you for what is vain in your oaths but He will catch you for that which your hearts have earned (intentionally) and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Clement (Kind)"
  2,226,"For those who swear to be away from their women (wives), is waiting (i.e. they should not go to them) for four months, then if they go back, then Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
  2,227,"And if they resolve on a divorce, then Allah is certainly Hearing, Knowing"
  2,228,"And women who are divorced should keep themselves waiting for three (menstrual) courses, and it is not lawful for them to hide that which Allah has created in their wombs, if they are believers in Allah and the period hereafter; and their husbands have a greater right to take them back in that (period), if they intend reconciliation. And for the (women) is the like of that which is (incumbent )on them of the recognised (good), (i.e. women too have rights like men) and for the men is a degree above the (women), and Allah is Mighty, Wise"
  2,229,"Divorce is (permitted) two times, so retain the (women) in a recognised (good manner) or let (them) go in a good manner. And it is not lawful for you that you should take (back) anything from that which you have given the (women) unless both fear that they will not be able to keep within the limits (imposed by) Allah. Then if you fear that they cannot keep within the limits (imposed by) Allah then there is no sin on both of them if the (woman) ransoms herself. Those are the limits (imposed by) Allah so do not exceed them and whoever exceeds the limits (imposed by) Allah then those are the unjust persons. nless both fear that they will not be able to keep within the limits (imposed by) Allah. Then if you fear that they cannot keep within the limits (imposed by) Allah then there is no sin on both of them if the (woman) ransoms herself. Those are the limits (imposed by) Allah so do not exceed them and whoever exceeds the limits (imposed by) Allah then those are the unjust persons"
  2,230,"So if he divorces her (for the third time), then she is not lawful for him thereafter until she marries another husband, then if he (the second husband also) divorces her then there is no sin upon them both (first husband and wife) if they return to each other (in wedlock) if they think that they can keep within the limits (imposed by) Allah. And those are the limits (imposed by) Allah which He makes clear for a people who have knowledge"
