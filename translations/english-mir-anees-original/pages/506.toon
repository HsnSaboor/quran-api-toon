quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  46,29,"And when We turned towards you a party of the jinn seeking to hear the Quran, so when they were present before it they said, “Be silent and listen.” Then when the (recital) had finished they turned towards their people (others like them) warning (them)"
  46,30,"They said, “O our people! we have heard a book sent down after Musa, confirming that which is before it, it guides towards the truth and towards a straight path"
  46,31,"O our people! respond to one who invites towards Allah and believe in Him, He will forgive you your sins and protect you from the painful punishment"
  46,32,"And he who does not respond to one who invites towards Allah, then he cannot defeat (Allah) in the earth and there will be no guardians for him besides Him. Those are in clear error,”"
  46,33,"Did they not consider that Allah Who created the skies and the earth, and was not tired in creating them, is able to give life to the dead? Why not ! He certainly has power over everything"
  46,34,"And the day those who do not believe will be presented before the fire (and asked). “Is not (all this happening) in reality?” They will say, “Why not by our Fosterer (it is real).”He will say, “Then taste the punishment because you used to reject (it)"
  46,35,"So be patient, as those among the messengers possessing determination were patient, and do not seek to hasten for them (the punishment). The day they will see that which they are promised, it will be as if they did not stay but for an hour of a day. (Your responsibility is) conveyance of the message. Then who (else) will be destroyed except the transgressing people"
