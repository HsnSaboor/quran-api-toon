quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  11,98,"He will lead his people on the day of resurrection so as to present them to the fire, and evil will be the place of presentation and those presented"
  11,99,And a curse was made to follow them in this (world) and on the day of resurrection. Evil will be the gift which will be gifted
  11,100,"That is from the news of the cities which We narrate to you, (some cities are still) standing while (others are) reaped (having been uprooted)"
  11,101,"And We did not do injustice to them but they did injustice to themselves; and their (presumed) gods whom they prayed to, besides Allah, were of no use to them in anything when the commandment of your Fosterer came to pass, and they did not add to them anything other than ruin"
  11,102,And like that your Fosterer seizes when He seizes the cities while they are unjust. His seizing is certainly severely painful
  11,103,In that there is certainly a sign for one who fears the punishment of the hereafter. That is the day on which mankind will be gathered and that is the day which will be witnessed
  11,104,And We do not delay it but till a term computed
  11,105,"The day when it comes, no soul will be able to speak except by His permission. Then of them (some) will be wretched while others blessed"
  11,106,"As for those who are wretched, they will be in the fire, therein for them there will be sighing and groaning"
  11,107,"they will stay in it so long as the skies and the earth endure, except as your Fosterer wills. Your Fosterer is certainly the Doer of what He intends"
  11,108,"And as for those who are blessed, they will be in the garden, they will stay in it so long as the skies and the earth endure, except as your Fosterer wills, a gift without break"
