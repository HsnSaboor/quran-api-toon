quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,7,"How can there be an agreement for the polytheists with Allah and with His messenger except those with whom you made an agreement near the Sacred Mosque? So as long as they are established (on the agreement) with regard to you, you (too) be established (on the agreement) with regard to them. Allah certainly loves those who guard (against evil)"
  9,8,"How (can there be an agreement)? If they have an upper hand on you, they neither have regard for ties of relationship nor (their) responsibility of (fulfilling) a pact. They please you with their mouths but their hearts refuse and most of them are transgressors"
  9,9,"They have sold the signs of Allah for a small price, so they turn away (people) from His way, certainly their (deeds) ! evil is that which they do"
  9,10,In (the case of) a believer they neither have regard for ties of relationship nor (their) responsibility of a pact and those are the ones who exceed the limits
  9,11,So if they repent and establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) then they are your brothers in religion. Thus do We explain the signs in detail for a people who know
  9,12,"And if they break their oaths after their agreement and taunt (you) in your religion then fight the leaders of infidelity that they may desist, because there is nothing (like a binding of) oaths for them"
  9,13,Will you not fight a people who broke their oaths and planned to send out the messenger and they attacked you first? Do you fear them? Then Allah has more right that you should fear Him if you are believers
