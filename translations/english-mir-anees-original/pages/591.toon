quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the sky and the Taariq
  86,2,And what will make you realize what Taariq is
  86,3,(It is) the piercing star
  86,4,There is not a single soul which does not have a custodian over it
  86,5,So let man see from what he was created
  86,6,He was created from gushing water (fluid)
  86,7,that comes out from in between the loins and the ribs
  86,8,"He is certainly able to return him, (and make him face)"
  86,9,"the day, (when) secrets will be examined"
  86,10,then there will neither be strength nor a helper for him
  86,11,By the sky that returns (the water in the form of rain)
  86,12,and the earth that splits (due to vegetation)
  86,13,this (Quran) is certainly a decisive statement
  86,14,and it is not (something to be taken as) a joke
  86,15,They certainly plot a plot
  86,16,and I (too) plot a plot
  86,17,"So give time to the infidels, give them time for a while"
  87,1,"Glorify the name of your Fosterer, the Most High"
  87,2,Who created then set the equilibrium
  87,3,and Who programmed then guided (to the programme)
  87,4,And Who brought forth the pasture
  87,5,then made it dust coloured rubbish
  87,6,"We will make you recite, so that you will not forget"
  87,7,"except that which Allah wills, He certainly knows the manifest and (also) that which is hidden"
  87,8,And We will make your (way) easy for the easy (way)
  87,9,"So remind, if reminding is profitable"
  87,10,he who fears will be reminded
  87,11,and he who is unfortunate will turn away from it
  87,12,he who will enter the great fire
  87,13,then he will neither die therein nor live
  87,14,He succeeds who purifies himself
  87,15,"and remembers the name of his Fosterer, then worships (offers salat)"
