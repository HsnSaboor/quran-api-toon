quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,103,"Then, when they both submitted and he (Ibrahim) laid him down on his forehead, (at that moment)"
  37,104,"We called out to him, “O Ibrahim"
  37,105,you have proved true the vision (by obeying in reality the order given to you through your dream so you need not sacrifice your son) thus do We reward the doers of good
  37,106,this was nothing but a clear trail.”
  37,107,And We ransomed him with a great slaughter (sacrifice of a sheep)
  37,108,And We left on him (the responsibility of conveying Our message) among others
  37,109,Peace on Ibrahim
  37,110,Thus do We reward the doers of good
  37,111,He was certainly among Our believing servants
  37,112,"And We conveyed to him the good news of Ishaq, a prophet, from among the righteous"
  37,113,And We showered Our blessings on him and on Ishaq. And among their descendents are those who do good and (also) those who are clearly unjust to their own souls
  37,114,And We bestowed Our favor on Musa and Harun
  37,115,and We saved both of them and their people from the great distress
  37,116,and We helped them so they were the victors
  37,117,And We gave them the book that made (things) clear
  37,118,and We guided them both to the straight path
  37,119,And We left on them both (the responsibility of conveying Our message) among others
  37,120,Peace on Musa and Harun
  37,121,Thus do We reward the doers of good
  37,122,They both were among Our believing servants
  37,123,And Ilyas was certainly from among the messengers
  37,124,"When he said to his people, “Why do you not guard (against evil)"
  37,125,Why do you pray to Baal (the false sun god presumed by you) and forsake (Allah) the Best of proportioners
  37,126,Allah is your Fosterer and the Fosterer of your forefathers.”
