quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,181,"Allah has heard the saying of those who said, \"Allah is poor and we are rich.\" We will record what they said, and their killing the prophets without having the right to do so, and We will say, \"Taste the punishment of burning"
  3,182,"That is because of what your hands have sent before, and because Allah is not unjust to His servants"
  3,183,"(To) those who said, \"Allah has made An agreement with us that we should certainly not believe in any messenger until he brings to us an offering which is consumed by the fire,\" say, \"Messengers had come to you before me with clear proofs and with that which you ask for, then why did you kill them, if you were truthful"
  3,184,"So if they deny you, thus messengers before you were (also) denied, (though) they had come with clear proofs and the scriptures (Zuboor) and the book giving light"
  3,185,"Every soul tastes death, and you will be paid back in full, your reward, only on the day of resurrection. So whoever is removed far away from the fire and is made to enter the garden, then he has achieved (the object), and the life of the world is nothing but a deceptive provision"
  3,186,"You will definitely be tested through your wealth and yourselves (personal efforts) and you will definitely hear much harmful (talk) from those who were given the book before you and from those who associate partners (with Allah), but if you are patient and guard (against evil) then that will certainly be a determining factor of affairs"
