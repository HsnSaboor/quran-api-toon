quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,73,"O prophet ! strive against the infidels and the hypocrites and be firm against them, and their settling place is hell and it is an evil destination"
  9,74,"They swear by Allah that they did not say (anything) and they did speak the word of infidelity, and they became infidels after their having accepted Islam, and they planned that which they could not attain, and they do not (take) revenge except (for the reason) that Allah and His messenger enriched them out of His grace, so if they repent it will be better for them and if they turn back, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the hereafter, and they will neither have a guardian nor a helper for them in the (whole of the ) earth"
  9,75,"And of them are those who made an agreement with Allah (saying), \"If He gives us out of His grace we will definitely give alms and we will definitely be of those who are righteous"
  9,76,But when He gave them out of His grace they hoarded it (being niggardly) and turned back and they withdrew (from the agreement)
  9,77,"Therefore, their consequence was, that He put hypocrisy in their hearts till the day they meet Him, because of their going against Allah in that which they had promised Him and because they lied"
  9,78,Do they not know that Allah knows what they hide and their secret talks and (that) Allah is the Knower of the unseen
  9,79,"Those who taunt such of the believers who give alms willingly and such who do not find (anything to give as alms) except (the fruit of) their striving, and consider the (believers) low among them, Allah will make them low among (the believers) and for them there is a painful punishment"
