quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  7,12,"He (Allah) said, \"What prevented you, that you did not bow down when I commanded you?\" He (Iblis) said, \"I am better than him, You created me from fire whereas You created him from clay"
  7,13,"He (Allah) said, \"Then go down from it, because it does not befit you that you should consider yourself great in it, so get out, you are certainly of those who are degraded"
  7,14,"He (Iblis) said, \"Give me time till they are raised (after death on the day of resurrection)"
  7,15,"He (Allah) said, \"You are certainly of those who are given time"
  7,16,"He (Iblis) said, \"Because You have removed me from the way, I will definitely sit waiting for them (human beings) on Your straight path"
  7,17,"then I will definitely come to them from before them and from behind them and from their right hand side and from their left hand side, and You will not find the majority of them grateful"
  7,18,"He (Allah) said, \"Get out of it, disgraced, driven away, whoever of them follows you, I will definitely fill hell with all of you"
  7,19,"And O Adam ! you and your wife dwell in the garden and eat from wherever you will, but do not go near this tree, for then you will be of the unjust"
  7,20,"But the devil whispered to them both, so as to make manifest to them that which was hidden from them of their shame, and said, \"Your Fosterer has forbidden you this tree only (for the reason that after eating it), both of you will become angels or become immortals"
  7,21,"And he swore to them both, \"I am certainly a sincere adviser to you"
  7,22,"Thus he caused them to fall through his deceit. So when they tasted of the tree their shame became manifest to them* and they both began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden, and their Fosterer called out to them, \"Did I not forbid you both (from going near) that tree and tell you both that the devil is certainly your open enemy?\" *Probably earlier to this they too, like the animals, were not conscious of shame"
