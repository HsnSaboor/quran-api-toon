quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  49,12,"O you who believe! avoid much of suspicion, (because) suspicion in some (cases) is certainly a sin, and do not spy (being inquisitive about the secrets of others) and do not backbite one another, would anyone of you love to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You dislike it! And fear Allah, Allah is certainly the Accepter of repentance, Merciful"
  49,13,"O mankind ! We created you from a male and a female and made you nations and tribes that you may recognize each other (as to who belongs to which nationality or tribe. But) the most honoured of you with Allah is certainly the one who guards most (against evil), Allah is certainly Knowing, Informed"
  49,14,"The desert Arabs say, “We have believed.” Say, “You have not (yet) believed (in the real sense of the word), therefore say, we have submitted, and belief has not yet entered into your hearts, and if you obey Allah and His messenger, He will not reduce anything from (the reward of) your deeds, Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
  49,15,"The (true) believers are only those who believe in Allah and His messenger then they do not doubt, and they strive with their wealth and their persons in the way of Allah, those are the persons who are truthful.”"
  49,16,"Say, “Would you make Allah know your religion when Allah knows whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth and (when) Allah is the Knower of everything?”"
  49,17,"They consider it their favour on you that they have accepted Islam. Say, “Do not consider your accepting Islam as a favour on me, no, Allah confers a favour on you by guiding you towards belief, if you are truthful"
  49,18,Allah certainly knows the unseen of the skies and the earth and Allah is a Seer of what you do.”
