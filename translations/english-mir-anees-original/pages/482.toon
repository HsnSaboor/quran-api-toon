quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"To Him is referred the knowledge of the hour of doom. And no fruits come out of their coverings nor any female bears nor she lays down but it is with His knowledge. And on the day He calls them, “Where are My partners?” They will say, “We announce to you, none of us has any evidence ( of any such partners).”"
  41,48,"And that which they used to pray to earlier, will go away from them, and they will realize ( that there is ) no escape for them"
  41,49,"Man does not get tired of praying for good but when evil afflicts him, then he is hopelessly despairing"
  41,50,"And if We make him taste mercy from Us after the harm that afflicted him, he definitely says, “This was ( due to ) me ( as my right ) and I do not think that the hour of doom will be established and ( even ) if I am brought back to my Fosterer, there will certainly be ( something ) good for me with Him.” So We will definitely inform those who did not believe, about that which they did and We will definitely make them taste ( something ) from a harsh punishment. hour of doom will be established and ( even ) if I am brought back to my Fosterer, there will certainly be ( something ) good for me with Him.” So We will definitely inform those who did not believe, about that which they did and We will definitely make them taste ( something ) from a harsh punishment"
  41,51,And when We show favour to man he keeps away and turns away to his side and when evil afflicts him then he is involved in lengthy prayers
  41,52,"Say, “You see, if the ( Quran ) is from Allah, then you do not believe in it, who is more astray then he who is deep in opposition?”"
  41,53,We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves . To the extent that it will become clear to them that it is the truth. Is it not sufficient concerning your Fosterer that He is a Witness over everything
  41,54,Beware ! they are certainly in doubt about ( their) meeting with their Fosterer. Beware ! He certainly encompasses everything
