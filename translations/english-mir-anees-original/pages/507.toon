quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"Those who do not believe and turn away (people) from the way of Allah, He makes their deeds get lost"
  47,2,"And those who believe and do righteous works and believe in that which is sent down on Muhammed, and that is the truth from their Fosterer, He removes from them their evils and sets right their condition"
  47,3,That is because those who do not believe follow falsehood and those who believe follow the truth from their Fosterer. Thus Allah sets forth for mankind their similitudes
  47,4,"So when you meet (in the battle) those who do not believe, strike off their necks until when you dominate them, then strengthen the bounds (of imprisonment); then afterwards, either show favour or ransom (them), till the war (ends and) lays down its burdens (do like) that. And if Allah wills, He can defend (you) from them, but (He involves you in such situations) that He may test some of you by means of others. And those who are killed in the way of Allah, their deeds will never be lost"
  47,5,He will guide them and set right their condition
  47,6,And He will make them enter the garden which He has made known to them
  47,7,"O you who believe! if you help Allah, He will help you and make your feet firm"
  47,8,"And those who do not believe, there is destruction for them and He makes their deeds get lost"
  47,9,"That is because they disliked that which Allah sent down, so He made their deeds become fruitless"
  47,10,"Have they not then traveled in the earth and seen, how the end of those before them was (brought about)? Allah brought down destruction upon them and for (these) infidels (too, there will be something) similar to it"
  47,11,"That is because Allah is the Guardian of those who believe, and because the infidels have no guardian for them"
