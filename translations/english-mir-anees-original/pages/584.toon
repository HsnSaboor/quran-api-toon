quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,When his Fosterer called him in the holy valley of Tuwa (saying)
  79,17,"Go to Firawn, he has certainly rebelled"
  79,18,"then say to him, “ Have you the inclination to purify yourself"
  79,19,"and that I should guide you to your Fosterer, so that you fear (Him)?”"
  79,20,Then he showed him the great sign
  79,21,but he denied and disobeyed
  79,22,then he turned away in haste
  79,23,then he gathered to proclaim
  79,24,"then said, “I am your top most fosterer.”"
  79,25,So Allah caught him for punishment (both in) the later and the former (life)
  79,26,There is certainly a lesson in that for one who fears
  79,27,Are you the stronger in creation or the sky which He built
  79,28,He raised its height and then set it in equilibrium
  79,29,And He darkened its night and brought out its day light
  79,30,"And He stretched out the earth (drifting the continents apart), after that"
  79,31,brought out from the (earth) its water and its pasture
  79,32,and He firmly anchored the mountains
  79,33,A provision for you and for your cattle
  79,34,So when the great predominating calamity comes
  79,35,the day man will recollect what he earnestly strove after
  79,36,And the hell will be made manifest for him who sees
  79,37,So as for him who rebelled
  79,38,and preferred the life of this world
  79,39,then hell will certainly be his home
  79,40,And as for him who feared to stand before his Fosterer and restrained himself from evil desire
  79,41,then the garden will certainly be his home
  79,42,"They ask you about the hour of doom, “When will be its anchorage (time of happening) ?”"
  79,43,In what way are you to discuss it
  79,44,To your Fosterer (belongs the knowledge of) the ultimate time of its happening
  79,45,You are a warner only for him who fears it
  79,46,"The day they see it, for them it will be as if they had not stayed (in their graves or this world) except for an evening or a morning of it"
