quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  19,12,"O Yahya ! hold the book with strength.\" And We gave him wisdom (in) childhood (itself)"
  19,13,"and compassion from Us and purity, and he was one who guarded (against evil)"
  19,14,"and dutiful to his parents and he was not compelling (rebellious), disobedient"
  19,15,And peace be on him on the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he will be raised alive
  19,16,And mention in the book (about) Maryam when she withdrew from her people to an eastern place
  19,17,and took a veil (to screen herself) from them. Then We sent to her Our spirit so he appeared to her like a balanced man
  19,18,"She said, \"I seek the protection of the Beneficent (Allah) from you if you are one who guards (against evil)"
  19,19,"He said, \"I am only a messenger of your Fosterer that I may grant to you a pure son"
  19,20,"She said, \"How can there be a son to me when man has not touched me and I am not one who has exceeded the limits"
  19,21,"He said, \"(It will be) like that. Your Fosterer says that is easy for Me and that We will make him a sign for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it is an affair decided"
  19,22,So she bore him then withdrew with him to a distant place
  19,23,"And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, \"I wish I had died before this and had become forgotten (as something) to be forgotten"
  19,24,"Then she was called from beneath her, “Do not grieve, your Fosterer has made a rivulet beneath you"
  19,25,"and shake the trunk of the date palm towards you, making ripe dates to fall down to you"
