quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"Say, “Is there anyone among your (presumed) partners (of Allah) who begins the creation then gets it reproduced?” Say, “Allah begins the creation then gets it reproduced, how then are you turned away (from the truth)?” “Allah begins the creation then gets it reproduced, how then are you turned away (from the truth)?”"
  10,35,"Say, “Is there anyone among your (presumed) partners (of Allah) who guides to the truth?” Say, “Allah guides to the truth.” Then has He, Who guides to the truth, greater right that He should be followed, or he who does not go aright unless he (himself) is guided? Then what is the matter with you? How do you judge?”"
  10,36,"And most of them follow nothing but conjecture (and) conjecture is certainly of no use in anything compared to the truth, and Allah is certainly the Knower of that which they do"
  10,37,"And this Quran is not such that it could be invented by someone besides Allah, but it confirms that which is before it and it is a detailed explanation of the book (prescribed law) from the Fosterer of the worlds, in which there is nothing doubtful"
  10,38,"Or do they say, “He has invented it.” Say, “(If any human being can invent it) then bring one chapter like it and call whomever you can besides Allah, if you are truthful.”"

  10,40,"And of them is he who believes in it, and of them is he who does not believe in it and your Fosterer has the best knowledge of those who are corrupt"
  10,41,"And if they deny you then say, “For me my deeds and for you your deeds; you are free from that which I do and I am free from that which you do.”"
  10,42,And of them are those who (pretend to) hear you. But can you make the deaf to hear when they are not (in a position to) understand
