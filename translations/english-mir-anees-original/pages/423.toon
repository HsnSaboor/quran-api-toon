quran[8]{c,v,t}:

Then, when Zaid fulfilled the necessary (formalities) of (divorcing) her, We joined her to you in marriage, so that there should be no blame on the believers in marrying the wives of their adopted sons, when they fulfill the necessary (formalities) of (divorcing) them, and the order of Allah was to be executed"
