quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,26,"For those who do good is a good (reward) and more, neither darkness nor disgrace will cover their faces, those are the inhabitants of the garden, they will stay therein"
  10,27,"And those who earn evils, (their) reward (will be) similar to their evil and disgrace will cover them, there will be no protector for them (to protect them) from Allah, their faces will be as if they were covered with pieces of dark night, those are the inhabitants of the fire, they will stay therein"
  10,28,"And on the day when We will gather them all together, then say to those who associated partners (with Us), “(Stay in) your places ! you and your partners.” Then We will separate them one from the other and their (presumed) partners will say, “It was not us that you served (worshipped)"
  10,29,so Allah is sufficient as a witness between us and you that we were unaware of your serving (worshipping) us.”
  10,30,"There every soul will examine that which it had sent before, and they will be returned to Allah their Real Guardian, and that which they used to falsely fabricate will go away from them"
  10,31,"Say, “Who provides you from the skies and the earth or who is it that has power over the hearing and the sight and who brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living and who governs the affair (of the universe)?” They will immediately say, “Allah,” then say, “Will you not then guard?”"
  10,32,"So, that is Allah your Real Fosterer. Then what is left after truth except error? How then are you turned away (from the truth)"
  10,33,Thus the word of your Fosterer is proved true on those who exceed the limits that they will not believe
