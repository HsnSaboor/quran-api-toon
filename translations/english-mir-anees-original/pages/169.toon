quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,150,"And when Musa returned to his people, angry and grieved, he said, \"Evil is that with which you succeeded me after me. Did you (wish to) hasten the command of your Fosterer?\" And he put down the tablets and seized his brother by the head, dragging him towards himself. He said, \"Son of my mother ! the people certainly considered me weak and almost killed me, so do not make the enemies rejoice over me and do not place me with the people who are unjust"
  7,151,"He said, \"My Fosterer ! protectively forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your mercy and You are the Most Merciful of those who are merciful"
  7,152,"Those who took the calf (for worship), anger from their Fosterer will certainly reach them and (also) disgrace in the life of this world. And thus do We reward those who invent lies"
  7,153,"And those who do evil works then repent after that and believe, your Fosterer, after that, is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
  7,154,"And when the anger of Musa calmed down, he took up the tablets, and in its inscription there was guidance and mercy for those who were afraid of their Fosterer"
  7,155,"And Musa chose seventy men from his people for Our appointed time/place, then when the earthquake took hold of them, he said, \"My Fosterer ! if You had willed You could have destroyed them before along with me. Will You destroy us for what the fools among us did? This is nothing but Your testing (us), through it You lead astray whom You will and You guide whom You will, You are our Guardian, therefore protectively forgive us and have mercy on us and You are the Best of those who protectively forgive"
