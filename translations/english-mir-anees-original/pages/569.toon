quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,(though) they will be made to see each other. The criminal would love to ransom himself from the punishment of that day by (sacrificing even) his sons
  70,12,and his wife and his brother
  70,13,and his family which gave him shelter
  70,14,"and whosoever is in the earth, all, (and) then save himself"
  70,15,By no means ! it is certainly a flaming fire
  70,16,taking off the skin
  70,17,It will invite him who turned back (from the truth) and went away
  70,18,and amassed (wealth) then withheld (it)
  70,19,Man is certainly hasty (by) character
  70,20,when evil afflicts him he is impatient
  70,21,and when good (even) touches him (he) is niggardly
  70,22,except the worshippers (those who offer salat)
  70,23,who are constant at their worship (salat)
  70,24,and in whose wealth there is a known (portion as the) right
  70,25,of one who asks and of one who is deprived (yet does not ask)
  70,26,and those who accept the truth of the day of judgment
  70,27,and those who are fearful of the punishment of their Fosterer
  70,28,the punishment of their Fosterer is certainly (something from which) one should not feel secure
  70,29,and those who guard their private parts
  70,30,"except from their wives or whom their right hands possess, so in their case they are not to be blamed"
  70,31,"but whoever seeks (something) beyond that, then those are the persons who are transgressors"
  70,32,and those who are faithful to their trusts and their agreements
  70,33,and those who stand firm on their testimonies
  70,34,and those who are custodians of their worship (salat)
  70,35,They will be honoured in gardens
  70,36,So what is the matter with those who do not believe that they rush towards you
  70,37,"from your right and from your left, in groups"
  70,38,Does every man among them hope that he will be made to enter the garden of bliss
  70,39,By no means ! they know (the thing) from which We created them
