quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  12,5,"He (father) said, “O my son ! do not narrate your vision to your brother lest they plot a plot against you. The devil is certainly an open enemy to man"
  12,6,"And thus your Fosterer will choose you and teach you the interpretation of events and make His favour complete on you and on the family of Yaqub, as He earlier completed it on your forefathers Ibrahim and Ishaq. Your Fosterer is certainly Knowing, Wise.”"
  12,7,"In Yusuf and his brothers, there are indeed signs for those who inquire"
  12,8,"When they said, “Yusuf and his brother are dearer to our father than we are, though we are a strong group. Our father is certainly in clear error"
  12,9,"Kill Yusuf or cast him away in some (other) land, then the attention of your father will be exclusively for you, and after that you become righteous people.”"
  12,10,"A speaker from among them said, “Do not kill Yusuf but put him in a deep well if you have (decided) to do (something to get rid of him, so that) some caravan may pick him up.”"
  12,11,"They said, “O our father ! what reason have you that you do not trust us with (respect to) Yusuf, when we are his sincere well wishers"
  12,12,Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play and we will be his protectors.”
  12,13,"He said, “It grieves me that you should take him away and I fear that the wolf may eat him when you are heedless of him.”"
  12,14,"They said, “(How) would the wolf eat him when we are a strong group? Then we would certainly be losers.”"
