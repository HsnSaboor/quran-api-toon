  9,35,"on the day it will be heated up in the fire of hell, then their foreheads and their sides and their backs will be branded with it. (It will be said to them), \"This is what you hoarded for yourselves so taste (the punishment of) that which you hoarded"
  9,36,"The number of months with Allah is certainly twelve months (in a year) in the ordinance of Allah (since) the day He created the skies and the earth, of them four are sacred (during which fighting is prohibited).

And fight the polytheists all together as they fight with you all together and know that Allah is certainly with those who guard (against evil)"
