quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  42,32,"And among His signs are the ships in the sea, like mountains"
  42,33,"If He wills, He can make the wind stationary so that the ( ships ) remain motionless on its back*. Certainly there are signs in that for every patient grateful one. * Surface of the sea"
  42,34,"Or He can cause them to perish due to that which they earned, but He pardons much"
  42,35,And ( let ) those who dispute concerning Our signs know ( that ) there is no escape for them
  42,36,"So anything that you are given, is only a ( temporary ) provision for the life of this world, and that which is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Fosterer"
  42,37,and those who avoid the great sins and indecencies and when they are angry they protectively forgive
  42,38,and those who respond to their Fosterer and establish worship ( salat ) and their affairs ( are decided by ) counsel among themselves and they spend from that which We have provided them
  42,39,"and those who, when oppression afflicts them, they defend themselves"
  42,40,"And the requital of an evil is an evil similar to it, but one who pardons and reconciles, then ( the responsibility of ) rewarding him is on Allah, He certainly does not like those who are unjust"
  42,41,"And for him who defends after an injustice was done to him, then for such, there is no way ( of blame ) against them"
  42,42,"The way ( of blame ) is only against those who do injustice to mankind and rebel in the earth without having the right to do so, for such, there will be a painful punishment"
  42,43,"And whoever is patient and forgives, ( then ) those are certainly among the affairs ( which require ) determination"
  42,44,"And he whom Allah leaves to stray, then for him there is no guardian after that. And you will see those who were unjust, that when they see the punishment they will say, “Is there any way to return?”"
