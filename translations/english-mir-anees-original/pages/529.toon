quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  54,7,"with their sight humbled, they will come out of the graves, as if they were scattered locusts"
  54,8,"hastening with their eyes fixed towards the announcer. The infidels will say, “This is a day of difficulty.”"
  54,9,"The people of Nuh denied before them, so they denied Our servant and said, “One influenced by jinn,” and he was scolded and driven away"
  54,10,"Then he prayed to his Fosterer, “I am overcome so help me.”"
  54,11,So We opened the gates of the sky with water pouring forth
  54,12,"and We caused the earth to gush forth with springs, so the waters met for (the execution of) an affair already programmed"
  54,13,And We carried him on (the ship) made of planks and nails (or planks tied with palm fibre)
  54,14,"sailing before Our eyes, a reward for him who was rejected"
  54,15,"And We left it as a sign, but is there anyone who will mind"
  54,16,Then how (terrible) was My punishment and My warning
  54,17,"And We have indeed made the Quran easy to remember (understand and be mindful), but is there anyone who will mind"
  54,18,"Aad denied, then how (terrible) was My punishment and My warning"
  54,19,We sent on them a furious wind during the day (period) of repeated loss
  54,20,uprooting men as if they were trunks of uprooted date palms
  54,21,Then how (terrible) was My punishment and My warning
  54,22,"And We have indeed made the Quran easy to remember, but is there anyone who will mind"
  54,23,Samood were deniers of the warnings
  54,24,"so they said, “Should we follow him who is a single man from among us? We will then certainly be in error and madness"
  54,25,"Has the reminder been made to come down (only) on him from among (all of) us? No, he is a self interested liar.”"
  54,26,Tomorrow they will know who is a self interested liar
  54,27,"We are sending the she camel as a test for them, so be vigilant (over) them and be patient"
