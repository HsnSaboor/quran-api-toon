quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  35,45,"And if Allah were to catch human beings for that which they earned (of sin), He would not have left on the surface of the (earth, any) of the moving creatures, but He gives them time till an appointed term, but when their term comes (to an end, He will catch them) because Allah is certainly One Who sees His servants"

  36,2,By the Quran full of wisdom
  36,3,you are certainly (one) of the messengers
  36,4,on the straight path
  36,5,"(The Quran is) sent down by the Mighty, the Merciful"
  36,6,that you may warn a people whose fathers were not warned so they are heedless
  36,7,The word has indeed proved true on most of them so they do not believe
  36,8,"We have placed chains round their necks and they are right up to the chins, so their heads are raised"
  36,9,"and We have made a barrier before them and a barrier behind them, then We have covered them, therefore they are not able to see"
  36,10,"And it is equal to them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe"
  36,11,"You can warn only him who follows the reminder and fears the Beneficent (Allah) without having seen Him, so convey to him the good news of protective forgiveness and an honourable reward"
  36,12,We certainly give life to the dead and record the (deeds) which they send before (in advance) and their footprints (work which they leave behind) and We have computed everything in a clear guide (book of deeds)
