quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,38,"He will say, \"Enter the fire with the communities which have passed away before you, from among the jinn and human beings.\" Whenever a community enters, it will curse its sister, (earlier community) until they follow each other into it, all together. The later of them will say regarding the former of them, \"Our Fosterer ! these led us astray, so give them double punishment of the fire.\" He (Allah) will say, \"For everyone there is double (punishment) but you do not know"
  7,39,"And the former of them will say to the later of them, \"So there is no preference for you over us, therefore taste the punishment for that which you used to earn"
  7,40,"Those who deny Our signs and (turn away) from them considering themselves great, the gates of the sky will certainly not be opened for them and they will not enter the garden until the camel passes the eye of the needle, and thus do We reward the criminals"
  7,41,"For them there will be a bed * in hell and coverings from above them, and thus do We reward the unjust. * Habitation"
  7,42,"And those who believe and do righteous works, We do not task a soul (anyone) but to its capacity, those are the inhabitants of the garden, they will stay in it"
  7,43,"And We will remove whatever of ill-feeling would be there in their hearts, rivers will flow beneath them and they will say, \"Praise is due only for Allah, Who guided us to this and we would not have been guided had Allah not guided us. Messengers of our Fosterer indeed came to us with the truth.\" And it will be called out to them, that: \"This is the garden, you have been made to inherit it because of that which you used to do"
