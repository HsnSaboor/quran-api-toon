quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  21,11,"And how many a town, which was unjust, did We destroy? And We produced after them other people"
  21,12,So when they felt Our might then they ran away from it
  21,13,"Do not run away but return to the enjoyment in which you were (engulfed) and your dwellings, that you may be questioned"
  21,14,"They said, \"Sorrowful is our state, we were certainly unjust"
  21,15,"So, that call of theirs did not cease till We made them (as) reaped (corn), motionless"
  21,16,"And We did not create the sky and earth and that which is between these two, for sport"
  21,17,"Had We intended to take to pastime We could have taken it from near Us, if (at all) We were to do (it)"
  21,18,"No ! We hurl the truth against the falsehood and it knocks out its brain and then it departs, and sorrowful is your state because of that which you describe"
  21,19,And whoever (or whatever) is in the skies and the earth is His and those who are with Him do not consider themselves great to serve Him nor/are they tired
  21,20,They glorify (Him) night and day without slowing down
  21,21,Or have they taken gods from the earth who will raise them (after their death)
  21,22,"Had there been (other) gods in the (skies and the earth), besides Allah, there would have been disorder, both (in the skies and the earth). So glorified be Allah, the Lord of the throne (of the universe). (He is high above) that which they describe"
  21,23,He cannot be questioned about what He does but they will be questioned
  21,24,"Or have they taken gods besides Allah? Say, \"Bring your proof; this is a reminder for those with me and a reminder for those before me.\" But the majority of them does not know the truth, therefore they turn away"
