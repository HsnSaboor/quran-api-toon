quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,They will be seeing (reclining) on couches
  83,36,Will not the infidels be rewarded according to what they used to do
  84,1,When the sky is split asunder
  84,2,"and responds to its Fosterer, a duty incumbent on it"
  84,3,And when the earth is stretched out
  84,4,and casts forth that which is in it and becomes empty
  84,5,"and responds to its Fosterer, a duty incumbent on it"
  84,6,"O man! you are certainly labouring towards your Fosterer, with a labour, so you will meet Him"
  84,7,So as for him who is given his record (of deeds) in his right hand
  84,8,"he will be called to account, with an easy accountability"
  84,9,and he will return happily to his class of people
  84,10,And as for him who is given his record (of deeds) behind his back
  84,11,he will call for (i.e. invoke) destruction (upon himself)
  84,12,and he will enter the (hot) blaze
  84,13,He was certainly happy in his class of people (in the worldly life)
  84,14,He certainly thought that he would never return
  84,15,"Why not, his Fosterer was certainly seeing him"
  84,16,So I do swear by the redness of the sunset
  84,17,and the night and that which it gathers
  84,18,and the moon when it is full
  84,19,You will definitely be carried from stage to stage
  84,20,So what is wrong with them that they do not believe
  84,21,"And when the Quran is, recited to them, they do not prostrate"
  84,22,"No, those who do not believe, deny"
  84,23,And Allah knows best what they hide
  84,24,So give them the news of the painful punishment
  84,25,"except those who believe and do righteous works, for them there is an unfailing reward"
