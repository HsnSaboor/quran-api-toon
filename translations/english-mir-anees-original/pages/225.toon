quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,"And O my people ! I do not ask you for wealth (as a reward) for it, my reward is with none but Allah and I am not going to drive away those who believe, they will certainly meet their Fosterer, but I see that you are an ignorant people"
  11,30,"And O my people ! who will help me against Allah if I drive them away, will you not then mind"
  11,31,"And I do not say to you that with me are treasures of Allah, nor do I know the unseen, and I do not say to you that I am an angel and I do not say about those whom your eyes hold in low estimation that Allah will never grant them good, Allah knows best that which is there in their souls, then I will certainly be of those who are unjust.”"
  11,32,"They said, “O Nuh, ! you have disputed with us and disputed too much with us, so bring upon us that which you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful.”"
  11,33,He said. “Only Allah can bring it upon you if He wills and you will not be able to frustrate (it)
  11,34,"And my advice will not profit you, if I intend to advise you while Allah intends to leave you in error, He is your Fosterer and towards Him you will be returned.”"
  11,35,"Or do they say, “He has forged it.” Say, “If I have forged it then on me is my crime and I am free from the crimes which are committed by you.”"
  11,36,"And it was communicated to Nuh that, “None of your people will believe except those who have already believed, so do not grieve because of what they do"
  11,37,"And build the ship before Our eyes and (according to) Our communication and do not speak to Me about those who are unjust, they will certainly be drowned.”"
