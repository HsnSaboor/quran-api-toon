  15,92,"So by your Fosterer, We will definitely question all of them"
  15,93,regarding that which they used to do
  15,94,So proclaim that which you are commanded to (proclaim) and turn away from the polytheists
  15,95,We are certainly sufficient for you against those who mock (at you)
  15,96,"those who set up another god with Allah, they will come to know"
  15,97,And We indeed know that your heart is straitened due to that which they say
  15,98,so glorify by praising your Fosterer and be of those who prostrate
  15,99,And serve your Fosterer till that which is certain comes to you
