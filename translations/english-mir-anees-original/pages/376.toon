quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,"(at that time), that which they were made to enjoy will not be of any use to them"
  26,208,And We did not destroy any town but it had its warners
  26,209,"(for) reminding, and We are not unjust"
  26,210,And the devils have not come down with the (Quran)
  26,211,and it neither suits them nor are they capable (of doing it)
  26,212,(on the contrary) they have been removed far away (even) from hearing (it)
  26,213,"So do not pray to another (presumed) god with Allah, lest you be of those who are punished"
  26,214,And warn your family (consisting) of close relatives
  26,215,And lower your wing for him who follows you from among the believers
  26,216,"And if they disobey you then say, \"I am certainly free of that which you do"
  26,217,"And put your trust in the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,218,Who sees you when you stand
  26,219,and your movements among those who prostrate
  26,220,"He is certainly the Hearing, the Knowing"
  26,221,Should I inform you (of those) on whom the devils come down
  26,222,"They come down on every liar, sinner"
  26,223,they deliver hearsay and most of them are liars
  26,224,"And the poets, those in error follow them"
  26,225,Do you not see that they wander distracted in every valley
  26,226,and that they say that which they do not practice
  26,227,"except those who believe and do righteous works and remember Allah much, and defend themselves after the in-justice that is done to them? And those who are unjust will know, to which place of turning back they will turn back"
