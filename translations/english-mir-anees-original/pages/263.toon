quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  15,16,And We have made galaxies in the sky and adorned it for those who see
  15,17,And We have protected it from every driven away devil
  15,18,"except him who steals a hearing, so a clear flame* follows him. * Probably a meteorite"
  15,19,And the earth We have stretched it and We have put in it (sedimentary) mountains and caused to grow in it everything balanced (in due proportion)
  15,20,"And We have made for you means of livelihood therein, and for him (too) for whom you are not the providers"
  15,21,And there is not a single thing but with Us are treasures of it and We do not send it down but in a known measure (according to a programme)
  15,22,"And We send the winds fertilizing, then We send down water from the sky and We provide it to you for drinking and you are not the storers of it"
  15,23,"And certainly, it is We Who bring to life and cause to die and We are the Inheritors"
  15,24,And We indeed know those of you who have (lived and) gone before (you) and We indeed know those who are (yet) to come
  15,25,"And your Fosterer will certainly gather them (all), He is certainly Wise, Knowing"
  15,26,And We had created man from mud containing black particles # (which were) processed . # Probably carbon compounds
  15,27,And the jinn We had created earlier from a fiery heat wave
  15,28,"And when your Fosterer said to the angels, “I am creating man from mud containing black particles (which were) processed"
  15,29,"so when I set him up in equilibrium and blow into him of My spirit, then fall bowing down to him.”"
  15,30,So the angels bowed down all of them together
  15,31,"except Iblis, he refused to be with those who bowed down"
