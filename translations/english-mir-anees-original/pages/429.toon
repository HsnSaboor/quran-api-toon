quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  34,8,"He has forged a lie against Allah or he is under the influence of a jinn.” No, those who do not believe in the hereafter are (involved) in the punishment, and in error they are far away (from the right path)"
  34,9,Did they not then consider that which is before them (future) and that which is behind them (past) of the sky and the earth? If We will We can cause the earth to sink with them or We can drop on them pieces from the sky. Certainly there is a sign in that for every servant who turns in repentance (to Allah)
  34,10,"And indeed We had given to Dawood grace from Us (ordering): O mountains! echo with him (Allah’s praise) and the birds (too), and We made the iron soft for him"
  34,11,"so as to make coats of mail, and measure the links therein, and do righteous work, I am certainly a Seer of what you do"
  34,12,"And (We made) the wind (to be under the control) of Sulaiman. Its morning (journey was equal to the journey of) a month and its evening (journey was equal to the journey of) a month and We made a fountain of copper to flow for him (probably in the form of a volcanic eruption) and from among the jinn (We gave him those) who worked before him by the order of his Fosterer, and whoever from among them deviated from Our command, We made him taste (something) from the punishment of blazing fire"
  34,13,"They made for him what he willed, of the fortresses and images and bowls like reservoirs and fixed cooking pots. Work! family of Dawood, being grateful and few of My servants are grateful"
  34,14,"Then when We decreed death for him, nothing indicated his death to them except a moving creature of the earth which ate away his staff, so when he fell down it was made clear to the jinn, that, had they known the unseen they would not have been remained in the disgraceful punishment (even after his death)"
