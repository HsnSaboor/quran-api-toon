quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  26,1,Taa Siin Miim
  26,2,Those are the signs of the book that makes clear
  26,3,You will perhaps kill yourself with grief because they do not believe
  26,4,"If We will, We can send down on them a sign from the sky, so that their necks would remain bowed down before it"
  26,5,And there does not come to them any new reminder from the Beneficent (Allah) but they turn away from it
  26,6,"So they have denied (it), therefore the news of that which they mock at, will come to them"
  26,7,Did they not see towards the earth how many beneficial (things) of every kind have We caused to grow in it
  26,8,There is certainly a sign in that but the majority of them does not believe
  26,9,"And your Fosterer ! He is certainly the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,10,"And when your Fosterer called out to Musa, that, \"Go to the unjust people"
  26,11,people of Firawn. Will they not guard (against evil)
  26,12,"He said, \"My Fosterer! I fear that they will deny me"
  26,13,"further, my bosom straitens and my language is not fluent, so send for Harun (to help me)"
  26,14,And they have (the charge of) a crime against me so I fear that they will kill me
  26,15,"He said, \"By no means, so both of you go with Our signs, We are with you, Hearing"
  26,16,"So go to Firawn then say: We are sent (by) the Fosterer of the worlds (with a message)"
  26,17,that you should send the children of Israel with us
  26,18,"He (Firawn) said, \"Were you not fostered among us as a child? And you did stay among us for many years of your life"
  26,19,and you did that deed of yours which you did and you are of the ungrateful ones
