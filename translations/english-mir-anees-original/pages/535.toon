quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,Youths always staying (in attendance) will go around them
  56,18,with bowls and beakers and cups (filled with drinks) from a spring
  56,19,They will not have headache from it nor will they be intoxicated
  56,20,And (they will have) fruits from what they choose
  56,21,and flesh of birds from that which they desire
  56,22,and fair ones with wide beautiful eyes
  56,23,"resembling in likeness, hidden pearls"
  56,24,a reward for that which they used to do
  56,25,They will hear therein nothing vain or sinful
  56,26,"but the statement, “Peace! Peace!”"
  56,27,And the companions of the right hand. How will the companions of the right hand be
  56,28,(They will be) among thorn less lote trees
  56,29,and clustered plantains
  56,30,and extending shade
  56,31,and water flowing continuously
  56,32,and fruits in plenty
  56,33,neither to be cut off nor forbidden
  56,34,and raised beds
  56,35,"We have produced them (females, and they are such) creation"
  56,36,that We have made them virgins
  56,37,"loving, equals in age"
  56,38,for the companions of the right hand
  56,39,Numerous from among the ancients
  56,40,and numerous from among the later
  56,41,And the companions of the left hand. How will the companions of the left hand be
  56,42,(They will be) in hot wind and boiling water
  56,43,and shadows of black smoke
  56,44,neither cool nor beneficial
  56,45,Before that (i.e. in the worldly life) they were well-off
  56,46,and they used to persist in great sin
  56,47,"and they used to say, “What! when we are dead and become (part of the) soil and bones, shall we indeed be raised (to life again)"
  56,48,and our forefathers (too)?”
  56,49,"Say, “Certainly, the ancients and the later"
  56,50,all will be gathered at the appointed time on the known day.”
