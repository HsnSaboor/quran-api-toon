quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  65,6,"Make the (divorced) women dwell (during the prescribed term) where you dwell, according to your means, and do not harm them so as to cause distress to them. And if they are pregnant then spend on them till they lay down their burden, then if they suckle (the child) for you then give them their due payment and consult among yourselves in a recognised (good manner) and if you face some difficulty, then let another (woman) suckle (the child) for him (the responsibility of payment being on the father)"
  65,7,"Let him who has abundance spend out of his abundance, and one who has his provision straitened on him, let him spend from that which Allah has given to him. Allah does not task a soul but (to the extent of) that which He has given it. Allah will make (things) easy after difficulty"
  65,8,"And how many a town revolted against the commandment of its Fosterer and His messengers, so We called it to account (that too) a severe account and We punished it (with) a severe punishment"
  65,9,"So it tasted the evil result of its affair and at the end of its affair, there was loss"
  65,10,"Allah has prepared a severe punishment for them, so fear Allah, O men of understanding who believe ! Allah has sent down to you a reminder"
  65,11,"(through) a messenger who recites to you clear signs of Allah, so as to bring out those who believe and do righteous works, from darkness towards light. And whoever believes in Allah and does righteous work, He will make him enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, to stay therein for ever. Allah has made a better provision for him"
  65,12,"Allah is He Who created the seven skies (seven higher levels), and of the earth (seven lower levels) similar to those (of the skies) . The commandment (of Allah) comes down among them that you may know that Allah has power over everything and that Allah has encompassed everything in (His) knowledge"
