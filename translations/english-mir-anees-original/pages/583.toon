quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,For those who guard (against evil there) is certainly an achievement
  78,32,Gardens and vineyards
  78,33,and young women of equal age
  78,34,and a full cup
  78,35,They will hear therein neither useless talk nor falsehood
  78,36,"Reward from your Fosterer, a gift (for the) account (of good deeds)"
  78,37,"The Fosterer of the skies and the earth and that which is between them, the Beneficent, they will not be able to address Him"
  78,38,"The day the spirit (Jibreel) and the angels stand in ranks, they will not speak, except the one who is permitted by the Beneficent and he speaks aright"
  78,39,"That's a real day (not fictitious), so whoever wills let him seek a home near his Fosterer"
  78,40,"We warn you of a punishment that is near, the day man will see that which his hands had sent forth and the infidel will say, “I wish I were dust.”"
  79,1,By those who pull out getting drowned (going deep to the last limit)
  79,2,"and those who untie, releasing"
  79,3,and those who are busy moving swiftly
  79,4,"then those who are ahead, being ahead"
  79,5,then those who manage the affair
  79,6,On the day the quaking one (the earth) will quake
  79,7,and the succeeding one will follow it
  79,8,on that day hearts will palpitate
  79,9,their looks will be cast down
  79,10,"They say, “Shall we be restored to our first state"
  79,11,even when we have become rotten bones?”
  79,12,"They say, “Then this would be a return of loss.”"
  79,13,So it will only be a single shout
  79,14,when they will be awake
  79,15,Has the story of Musa come to you
