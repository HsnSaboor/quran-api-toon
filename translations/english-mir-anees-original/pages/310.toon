  19,75,"Say, \"For one who is in error, the Beneficent (Allah) allows (the rope of leniency) to stretch for him (with a set) stretching, until when they see that which they were promised, either the punishment or the hour of doom, then they will know who is in an evil position and weaker in forces"
  19,76,"And Allah increases the guidance of those who receive guidance, and the (permanent) righteous works which remain, are better in the sight of your Fosterer, in respect of reward and better in respect of returns"
