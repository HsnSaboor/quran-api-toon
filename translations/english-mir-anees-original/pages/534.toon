quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  55,68,In both of them are fruits and date palms and pomegranates
  55,69,So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
  55,70,In both of them are good and beautiful ones
  55,71,So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
  55,72,"Fair ones, confined in pavilions"
  55,73,So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
  55,74,Whom neither man nor jinn touched before them
  55,75,So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
  55,76,Reclining on green cushions and beautiful carpets
  55,77,So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
  55,78,"Blessed is the name of your Fosterer, Possessor of glory and honour"
  56,1,When the event befalls
  56,2,there is no falsehood in its befalling
  56,3,(it will) bring down (some and) exalt (others)
  56,4,When the earth will be shaken (with) a shaking
  56,5,and the mountains will be crumbled (with) a crumbling
  56,6,so that they will become as scattered dust
  56,7,And you will become three kinds
  56,8,So the companions of the right hand. How will the companions of the right hand be
  56,9,And the companions of the left hand. How will the companions of the left hand be
  56,10,And the foremost are the foremost
  56,11,Those are the persons who will be brought near
  56,12,in gardens of bliss
  56,13,numerous from among the ancients
  56,14,and less from among the later
  56,15,(they will be) on couches encrusted (with gold and precious stones)
  56,16,reclining on them facing one another
