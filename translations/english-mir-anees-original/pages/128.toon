quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,1,"Praise is due only for Allah, Who created the skies and the earth and made the darkness and the light, (even) then those who do not believe equate others with their Fosterer"
  6,2,"He it is Who created you from clay then decreed a term and there is a term named with Him, (even) then you doubt"
  6,3,"And He is Allah in the skies and in the earth, He knows that which you hide and that which you manifest and He knows that which you earn"
  6,4,And there did not come to them any sign from the signs of their Fosterer but they turned away from it
  6,5,"Thus they denied the truth when it came to them, so the news of that which they mocked at, will come to them"
  6,6,"Did they not see, how many a generation We destroyed before them, whom We had established in the earth more firmly than We have established you, and on whom We had sent abundant rain (from) the sky and (thereby) made the rivers to flow beneath them? Then We destroyed them for their sins and We raised after them another generation. tion"
  6,7,"And had We sent down to you a writing on a page so that they could touch it with their hands (even then) those who did not believe would have said, “This is nothing but clear magic.”"
  6,8,"And they say ask \"why has not an angel been sent down to him?\" And had We sent down an angel, then the matter would have been decided (and) after that they would not have been allowed time (to amend)"
