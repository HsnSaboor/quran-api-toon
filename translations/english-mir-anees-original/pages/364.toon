quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,44,"Or do you think that the majority of them hears or understands? They are nothing but like cattle, no, they are more astray from the way"
  25,45,"Did you not consider (the work of) your Fosterer, how He stretches the shade (which ultimately ends in night)? And had He willed he could have made it stationary. Then We have made the sun its guide"
  25,46,"Then We draw it towards Ourselves, an easy in drawing"
  25,47,And He it is Who has made the night a covering for you and the sleep a (source of) rest and He has made the day for rising up again
  25,48,"And He it is Who sends the winds (giving) good news before His mercy, and We send down from the sky clean water"
  25,49,"that We may give life through it to a dead land and We make many cattle and human beings, whom We created, to drink it"
  25,50,"And We have repeated it among them that they may be mindful, but the majority of mankind refuses (everything) except infidelity"
  25,51,And had We willed We would have raised a warner in every town
  25,52,"So do not obey the infidels and strive against them with it ( the Quran), a great striving"
  25,53,"And He it is Who has let free the two seas, one that quenches thirst, sweet; and the other saltish, bitter. And He has made between them a barrier and prevented (them from getting mixed up, by a) prevention"
  25,54,And He it is Who created man from water and has appointed for him blood relationships and marriage relationships and your Fosterer is Powerful
  25,55,And they serve (worship) besides Allah that which neither profits them nor harms them. And the infidel is one who helps against his Fosterer
