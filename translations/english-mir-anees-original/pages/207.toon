quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,123,O you who believe ! fight those of the infidels who are near you and let them find firmness in you. And know that Allah is certainly with those who guard (against evil)
  9,124,"And whenever a chapter (of the Quran) is sent down, then from among them is he who says, \"Which of you has this (chapter of the Quran) increased in belief? \"So, as for those who believe, it has (further) increased them in belief and they rejoice"
  9,125,"And as for those in whose hearts is a disease, it has (only) added uncleanliness to their uncleanliness and they die while they are infidels"
  9,126,"Do they not see that they are afflicted once or twice every year, even then, they neither repent nor are they mindful"
  9,127,"And whenever a chapter (of the Quran) is sent down, some of them look at others, (as if saying), \"Does anyone see you?\" Then they turn away. Allah has turned away their hearts because they are a people who do not understand"
  9,128,"There has come to you a messenger from among yourselves, grievous to him is your distress, (he is) excessively desirous for your (good) and full of pity and merciful to the believers"
  9,129,"So if they turn back, then say, \"Allah is sufficient for me, there is no god but He, in Him have I put my trust and He is the Lord of the great throne (of the universe)"
