  51,8,you are certainly differing in word (opinions)
  51,9,"He is turned away from the (truth), who (himself) turns away"
  51,10,Slain be the liars
  51,11,those who are heedless in ignorance
  51,12,"They ask, “When is the day of judgment?”"
  51,13,The day on which they will be punished over the fire
  51,14,"(it will be said), \"Taste your punishment, this is what you sought to be hastened"
  51,15,Those who had guarded (against evil) will certainly be in gardens and springs
  51,16,taking that which their Fosterer gives them. Before that they certainly used to be doers of good
  51,17,It was (only) a small (part) of the night (during) which they used to sleep
  51,18,and they used to ask for protective forgiveness at dawns
  51,19,and in their wealth there was a right (i.e. a portion) for him who begged and for him who was prevented (from begging)
  51,20,And in the earth there are signs for those who are certain

  51,30,"They said, “Thus (it will be), says your Fosterer. He is certainly the Wise, the Knowing.”"
