quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,About what do they ask one another
  78,2,About the great news
  78,3,concerning which they disagree
  78,4,"No, they will come to know"
  78,5,"Again, no, they will come to know"
  78,6,Did We not make the earth habitable
  78,7,and the mountains pegs
  78,8,And We created you in pairs
  78,9,And We made your sleep for rest
  78,10,And We made the night a covering
  78,11,And We made the day (for earning) livelihood
  78,12,And We built above you seven strong ones
  78,13,And We made (the sun) a burning lamp
  78,14,"And We sent down from the rain-clouds, torrential rain"
  78,15,that We may bring forth through it grain and vegetation
  78,16,and dense gardens
  78,17,The day of decision is certainly fixed
  78,18,The day it will be blown into the trumpet (or structure of the universe) you will come forth in groups
  78,19,And the sky will be opened so that it will become gates
  78,20,"and the mountains will be moved away, so that they will become like flowing sand"
  78,21,Hell certainly lies in wait
  78,22,a home for the rebellious
  78,23,They will stay in it for ages
  78,24,They will taste therein neither coolness nor drink
  78,25,"except boiling water and pus*, * Dirty liquid that oozes out of wounds"
  78,26,a reward proportional (to their sins)
  78,27,They certainly did not hope that they would have to account for (their evil deeds)
  78,28,and they denied Our signs with a denial
  78,29,and We have computed everything in a record
  78,30,"So taste (the punishment), and We will not increase for you anything except punishment"
