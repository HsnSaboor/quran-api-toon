quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  20,65,"They said, \"O Musa! will you throw or shall we be the first to throw"
  20,66,"He said, \"No! you throw.\" So when (they threw), their ropes and their rods appeared to him, due to their magic, as if they were in motion"
  20,67,So Musa conceived a fear in his mind
  20,68,"We said, \"Do not fear, you will certainly be uppermost"
  20,69,"and throw that which is in your right hand, it will swallow that which they have made. (What) they have made is only a magician's plot and the magician will not be successful wherever he goes"
  20,70,"So the magicians were thrown bowing down, saying, \"We believe in the Fosterer of Harun and Musa"
  20,71,"He (Firawn) said, \"You believe in him before I give you permission? He (Musa) is certainly a great (expert) among you all who has taught you the magic. So I will definitely cut off your hands and your feet from opposite sides and I will definitely crucify you on the trunks of the palm trees, and you will definitely know which of us has more severe and more lasting punishment"
  20,72,"They said, \"We will never prefer you to what has come to us of the clear proofs and to Him Who initiated our creation. So decide whatever you (wish to) decide, you can decide only about the life of this world"
  20,73,"We certainly believe in our Fosterer, (and hope) that He will protectively forgive us our faults and the magic to which you compelled us, and Allah is the Best and One Who remains for ever"
  20,74,"Whoever comes to his Fosterer as a criminal, then for him, certainly there is hell, he will neither die therein nor live"
  20,75,"And whoever comes to Him as a believer having done righteous works, then those are the persons for whom there are high ranks"
  20,76,"gardens of everlasting bliss, beneath which rivers flow, they will stay therein and that is the reward of him who purifies (himself). (R)"
