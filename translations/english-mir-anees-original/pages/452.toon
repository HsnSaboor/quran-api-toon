quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,"What is (wrong) with you, how do you judge"
  37,155,Will you not then mind
  37,156,Or have you a clear authority
  37,157,Then come with your book if you are truthful
  37,158,And they assign a relationship between Him and the jinn and the jinn know that they will be presented (before Him)
  37,159,glorified be Allah (He is far) from that which they describe
  37,160,"except the servants, exclusively of Allah"
  37,161,So you and that which you serve (worship)
  37,162,you cannot mislead (anyone) against Him
  37,163,except him who is to enter hell
  37,164,"And there is no one among us, but there is a known place for him"
  37,165,and we are certainly those set in ranks
  37,166,and we are certainly those who glorify
  37,167,And they used to say
  37,168,"“Had we with us, a reminder of the ancients"
  37,169,"we would have definitely been servants, exclusively of Allah.”"
  37,170,"But (now) they do not believe in this (Quran), so they will know"
  37,171,"And Our word has already gone forth in respect of Our servants, the messengers"
  37,172,that they will certainly be helped
  37,173,"And Our forces, they will be victors"
  37,174,So turn away from them till a time
  37,175,"and keep seeing them, for they (too) will see"
  37,176,Do they seek to hasten on Our punishment
  37,177,"But when it comes down in their court, then evil will be the morning of those warned"
  37,178,And turn away from them till a time
  37,179,"and keep seeing, for they (too) will see"
  37,180,"Glorified be your Fosterer, Lord of Might, (He is far) from that which they describe"
  37,181,and peace on the messengers
  37,182,"and praise is due only for Allah, the Fosterer of the worlds"
