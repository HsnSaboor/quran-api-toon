quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and its light
  91,2,and the moon when it reflects it
  91,3,and the day when it unveils it
  91,4,and the night when it covers it
  91,5,and the sky and Him Who built it
  91,6,and the earth and Him Who spread it
  91,7,and the soul and Him Who balanced it
  91,8,"then inspired in it, its transgressions and its guarding (against evils)"
  91,9,He indeed succeeds who purifies it
  91,10,and he indeed fails who buries it
  91,11,Samood denied (the truth) due to their rebellion
  91,12,when the most wretched of them broke forth
  91,13,"The messenger of Allah told them, “It is the she-camel of Allah, so let her drink.”"
  91,14,But they denied him and slaughtered her so their Fosterer destroyed them due to their sin and thus balanced it (the destruction was equal to their crime)
  91,15,And He does not fear its consequence
  92,1,By the night when it covers (the sun)
  92,2,and the day when it unveils (the sun)
  92,3,and Him Who created the male and the female
  92,4,Your striving is certainly for diverse ends
  92,5,So as for him who gave and guarded (against evil)
  92,6,and accepted that which was best
  92,7,We will facilitate him for ease
  92,8,And as for him who was niggardly and considered himself independent
  92,9,and denied that which was best
  92,10,We will facilitate him for difficulty
  92,11,And his wealth will not keep him safe from difficulty when he perishes
  92,12,It is certainly on Us to guide
  92,13,"And certainly, Ours is the latter (future) and the former (past)"
  92,14,So I warn you of the blazing fire
