  40,67,"He it is Who created you from the soil, then from the sperm, then from that which clings and hangs like a leech, then He brings you out as a child, then ( He keeps you alive ) so that you reach your ( age ) of strength, then ( He keeps you alive ) so that you become old, and among you is he who is taken back ( i.e. dies ) earlier, so that ( all of ) you reach the ( end of the ) appointed term, and that you may understand"
  40,68,"He it is Who gives life and causes to die. So when He decides an affair, then He says to it only, “Be,” so it is"
  40,69,"Did you not see towards those who dispute concerning the signs of Allah, how they are turned away"
  40,70,"Those who deny the book and that with which We sent Our messengers, they will come to know"
  40,71,when they will be tied in their necks and chained to be dragged
  40,72,"into the boiling water, then in the fire they will be burned"
  40,73,"Then it will be said to them, “Where are those whom you used to associate as partners ( with Allah)"
  40,74,"(and to whom you prayed to ) besides Allah?” They will say, “They have gone away from us, no, we did not pray to anything earlier.” Thus Allah will leave the infidels to stray"

  40,76,"Enter the doors of hell to stay therein, so evil is the home of the proud"
  40,77,"So be patient, Allah’s promise is certainly true, so whether We show you something of that which We promise them or We take you back ( i.e. cause you to die ), ultimately towards Us will they ( all ) be returned"
