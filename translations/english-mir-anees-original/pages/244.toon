quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  12,70,"So when he provided them with their provision, he put the drinking cup in his brother’s bag. Then an announcer announced, “O caravan ! you are certainly thieves.”"
  12,71,"They said, while facing them, “What is it that you miss?”"
  12,72,"They said, “We miss the king’s drinking cup and he who brings it will have a camel load and I am responsible for it.”"
  12,73,"They said, “By Allah, you know for certain that we have not come to cause corruption in the land and we are not thieves.”"
  12,74,"They said, “Then what should be the penalty for it if you are liars?”"
  12,75,"They said, “The penalty for it (is that), he in whose bag it is found, he (himself will receive) the penalty for it, thus do we penalize the unjust.”"
  12,76,"So he began (the search) with their sacks before (searching) the sack of his brother, then he brought out the (cup) from the sack of his brother. Thus did We plot for Yusuf. It was (otherwise) not (possible) for him to retain his brother under the law of the king unless Allah willed. We raise the grades of whom We will, and above every possessor of knowledge there is (the Great) Knower"
  12,77,"They said, “If he has stolen, then his brother too stole earlier,” but Yusuf kept it a secret in his soul and did not reveal it to them. He said, “You are in a bad position and Allah knows what you describe.”"
  12,78,"They said, “O you who are mighty ! He has a father a very old man, so you seize one of us in his place, we see you to be of the doers of good.”"
