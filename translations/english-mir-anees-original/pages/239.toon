quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  12,31,"So when she heard of their plot (to defame her) she sent for them and prepared for them a banquet and gave to everyone of them a knife and said ( to Yusuf), “Come out before them.” So when they saw him they regarded him great and (in their amazement) cut their hands and said, “Glory be to Allah above all ! this is not a human being, he is none other than an honoured angel.”"
  12,32,"She said, “That is the person with respect to whom you blamed me and I did seek to make him yield himself to me but he abstained, and if he does not do what I command him to do, he will definitely be imprisoned and he will be of those who are degraded.”"
  12,33,"He said, “My Fosterer ! the prison is dearer to me than that to which they invite me and if You do not turn away their plot from me, I may incline towards them and become one of the ignorant.”"
  12,34,"So his Fosterer responded to him and turned away from him their plot, He is certainly the Hearing, the Knowing"
  12,35,"Then it became clear to them, after having seen the signs, that they should imprison him till a time"
  12,36,"And two young men entered the prison with him. One of them said, “I say myself pressing wine (in my dreams),” and the other said, “I saw myself carrying bread on my head from which birds ate. Inform us about its interpretation, we certainly see you to be of the doers of good.” rm us about its interpretation, we certainly see you to be of the doers of good.”"
  12,37,"He said, “The food which you are provided with would not (even) come to you but I will inform you both about its interpretation before it(actually) come to you, that is (something) of what my Fosterer has taught me, I have forsaken the religious dictates of people who do not believe in Allah and do not believe in the hereafter"
