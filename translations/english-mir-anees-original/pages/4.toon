quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire, so when it enlightened that which was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness (so that) they do not see"
  2,18,"deaf, dumb, blind, therefore they cannot return (to the light)"
  2,19,"Or like a rainstorm from the sky, in which is darkness and thunder and lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears (because of) the fear of death from the thunder-claps, and Allah encompasses the infidels *. *Those who reject Divine Communications (Kafir)"
  2,20,"The lightning almost snatches away their sight, whenever it shines on them they walk therein, and when it darkens over them they stand still. And had Allah willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight, Allah certainly has power over everything"
  2,21,"O mankind ! serve your Fosterer Who created you and those before you, so that you may save yourselves (from the punishment)"
  2,22,"Who made the earth a spreading for you, and the sky, a structure (above you); and sent down water from the sky so as to bring out fruits through it as sustenance for you; so do not set up equals for Allah while you know"
  2,23,"And if you are in doubt concerning (the Quran) which We have sent down to Our servant, then bring a chapter like it and call your witnesses besides Allah, if you are truthful"
  2,24,"But if you do not do it, and you will never do it, then be on your guard against the fire prepared for the infidels whose fuel will be human beings and stones"
