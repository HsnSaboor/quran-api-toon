  26,115,I am nothing but a plain warner
  26,116,"They said, \"If you do not desist, O Nuh! you will definitely be of those who are stoned (to death)"
  26,117,"He said, \"My Fosterer! my people have certainly denied me"
  26,118,"so decide between me and them (by pronouncing) a judgment, and deliver me and those of the believers who are with me"
  26,119,"So We delivered him and those with him, in the loaded ship"
  26,120,Then after that We drowned those who remained behind

  26,131,So fear Allah and obey me
  26,132,And fear Him Who helped you with that which you know
  26,133,He has helped you with cattle and sons
  26,134,and gardens and springs
