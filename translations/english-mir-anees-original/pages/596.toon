quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,None will enter it except the wretched
  92,16,who denied and turned away
  92,17,And one who guards (against evil) will be saved from it
  92,18,he who gives his wealth for his self purification
  92,19,"and he does not bestow favour on anyone, from that which is with him, (with the intention of) being rewarded (back)"
  92,20,"but he seeks the Attention of his Fosterer, the High"
  92,21,And he will surely be pleased
  93,1,By the brightness of the day
  93,2,and the night when it darkens
  93,3,Your Fosterer has neither forsaken you nor does he hate you
  93,4,And surely the latter period (future) will be better for you than the former (past)
  93,5,And surely you will be given (so much) by your Fosterer that you will be pleased
  93,6,"Did He not find you an orphan, then give you shelter"
  93,7,and find you wandering then guide you
  93,8,and find you poor then make you free of want
  93,9,So as for the orphan do not oppress (him)
  93,10,and as for the beggar do not drive him away
  93,11,"and as for the favour of your Fosterer, do proclaim"
  94,1,Did We not expand for you your bosom
  94,2,and relieve you of your burden
  94,3,which weighed down your back
  94,4,and exalted for you your mention
  94,5,So certainly with difficulty is ease
  94,6,Certainly with difficulty is ease
  94,7,"So when you are free, then strive"
  94,8,and turn your attention towards your Fosterer
