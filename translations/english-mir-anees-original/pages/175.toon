quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"Say, \"I have no power to benefit or harm myself, (I have nothing) except that which Allah wills; and had I known the un seen I would have had abundance of good and evil would not have (even) touched me. I am but a warner and a conveyer of good news to people who believe"
  7,189,"He it is Who created you from a single soul and made from it, its mate, to dwell with her. So when he covers her she bears a light burden and moves about with it, then when it becomes heavy they both pray to Allah their Fosterer, \"If You give us a good (child) we will definitely be of those who are grateful"
  7,190,"But when He gives them a good (child) they associate with Him partners in that which He gave them, but Allah is high above that which they associate (with Him)"
  7,191,Do they associate (such) partners (with Allah) who do not create anything while they themselves are created
  7,192,And they have no power to help them nor can they help themselves
  7,193,"And if you invite them towards guidance, they do not follow you, it is the same to you whether you invite them or you be silent"
  7,194,"Those whom you pray to, besides Allah, are certainly servants like you, so pray to them then let them respond to you if you are truthful"
  7,195,"Have they feet with which they walk, or have they hands with which they hold or have they eyes with which they see or have they ears with which they hear? Say, \"Call upon (those whom you consider as Allah's) partners then plan and give me no time to wait"
