quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When the sky is cleft asunder
  82,2,and when the planets are made to fall
  82,3,and when the oceans are made to overflow
  82,4,and when the graves are overturned
  82,5,(every) soul will know what it had advanced (preferred) and what it had kept behind (not preferred)
  82,6,O man ! what has deceived you concerning your Honoured Fosterer
  82,7,"Who created you, then set the equilibrium in you so as to balance you"
  82,8,"In whatever form He willed, He constituted you"
  82,9,"No, but you deny the (day of) judgment"
  82,10,And certainly over you are custodians
  82,11,honoured recorders
  82,12,they know what you do
  82,13,The righteous will certainly be in bliss
  82,14,And the transgressors will certainly be in hell
  82,15,They will enter it on the day of judgment
  82,16,and they will not be absent from it
  82,17,And what will make you realize what the day of judgment is
  82,18,"Again, what will make you realize what the day of judgment is"
  82,19,"The day on which no soul (person) will have any power on another soul (person), and the command on that day will be (totally) Allah’s"
  83,1,Sorrowful is the state of those who measure and weigh less than what is due
  83,2,"those who, when they take by measure from other people, they take in full"
  83,3,"but when they measure or weigh for others, they make it less than what is due"
  83,4,Do they not expect that they will be raised (after their death)
  83,5,for a great day
  83,6,the day mankind will stand before the Fosterer of the worlds
