quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,92,"You will never attain righteousness unless you spend from that which you love, and whatever you spend of anything, then Allah certainly has knowledge of it"
  3,93,"All food was lawful to the children of Israel except that which Israel (Yaqub) had made unlawful for himself before the Torah was sent down. Say, \"Bring the Torah and read it, if you are truthful"
  3,94,"So whoever fabricates a lie against Allah after that, then those are the persons who are unjust"
  3,95,"Say, \"Allah has spoken the truth, then follow the religion (dictated by) Ibrahim the upright and he was not of the polytheists"
  3,96,"The first house layed down for mankind is certainly the one at Becca (Kaaba at Mecca), one (which is) blessed and a guidance for the worlds"
  3,97,"In it are clear signs, the place where Ibrahim stood, and whoever enters it, he is in security. And the pilgrimage to the house (Kaaba, is a duty incumbent) on human beings, for (the sake of ) Allah, on him who is able to find a way to it (one who has the capacity and can afford the journey), but he who rejects, then Allah is Independent of the worlds"
  3,98,"Say, \"O owners of the book ! why do you reject the signs of Allah when Allah is a Witness over what you do"
  3,99,"Say, \"O owners of the book ! why do you stop from the path of Allah, one who believes, seeking crookedness in it while you (yourselves) are witnesses? And Allah is not unaware of what you do"
  3,100,"O you who believe ! if you obey a party of those who were given the book, they will turn you back as infidels after your belief"
