quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun is made to wind up
  81,2,and when the stars become hazy
  81,3,and when the mountains are moved away
  81,4,and when camels with ten months' pregnancy are left off
  81,5,and when wild animals are brought together
  81,6,and when the oceans are flooded
  81,7,and when the souls are paired (probably with their respective bodies)
  81,8,and when the female child buried alive is asked
  81,9,for what sin she was killed
  81,10,and when the pages are spread
  81,11,and when the sky has its covering removed
  81,12,and when the hell is kindled
  81,13,and when the garden is brought near
  81,14,(every) soul (everyone) will know what (deeds) it has brought for presentation
  81,15,So I do swear by those that withdraw
  81,16,"those that move swiftly, hiding"
  81,17,and the night when it comes (and goes)
  81,18,and the morning when it breathes (and makes us conscious)
  81,19,it is certainly the word of an honoured messenger (Jibreel)
  81,20,"possessor of power, established in the presence (of Allah) to Whom belongs the throne"
  81,21,"one to be obeyed, and with it trustworthy"
  81,22,And your companion (Muhammed) is not possessed by jinn
  81,23,And he (Muhammed) saw him (Jibreel) on the clear horizon
  81,24,And he is not a miser concealing (information) of the unseen
  81,25,And it is not the word of the cursed devil
  81,26,So in' which direction are you all going
  81,27,The (Quran) is nothing but a reminder to the worlds
  81,28,for him among you who wills to be upright
  81,29,"And you do not will unless Allah, the Fosterer of the worlds, wills"
