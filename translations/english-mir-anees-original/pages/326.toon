quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  21,45,"Say, \"I warn you only according to the communication (I receive), but the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned"
  21,46,"And (even) if the breath of the punishment of your Fosterer were to touch them, they would definitely say, \"Sorrowful is our state, we were certainly unjust"
  21,47,"And We will set up a just balance on the day of resurrection so that no soul will be dealt with unjustly (in any) thing, and if there be (even) the weight of a grain of a mustard seed, We will bring it (to account) and We are sufficient to take account"
  21,48,And We gave to Musa and Harun that which differentiates (between right and wrong) and a light and a reminder for those who guard (against evil)
  21,49,who fear their Fosterer in secret (without having seen Him) and are (also) fearful of the hour of doom
  21,50,"And this is a blessed reminder which We have sent down. Will you then reject it? (R 4, P 16 ¼)"
  21,51,And earlier We gave Ibrahim (instructions to follow) the way (which was) right for him and We knew about him
  21,52,"when he said to his father and his people, \"What are these images to whose (worship) you stick (devotedly)"
  21,53,"They said, \"We found our fathers worshipping them"
  21,54,"He said, \"Indeed you are and your fathers were in clear error"
  21,55,"They said, \"Have you (really) brought to us the truth or are you of those who are not serious"
  21,56,"He said, \"No! your Fosterer is the Fosterer of the skies and the earth Who initiated their creation and I am of those who bear witness to that"
  21,57,"And by Allah, I have a definite plot for your idols after you go away turning your backs"
