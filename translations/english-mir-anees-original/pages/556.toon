quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  64,1,"Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth glorifies Allah, His is the kingdom and to Him is due (all) praise and He has power over everything"
  64,2,"He it is Who created you, but one of you is an infidel and one of you is a believer, and Allah is a Seer of that which you do"
  64,3,"He created the skies and the earth in reality, and He gave you form and made your forms good, and towards Him is the destination"
  64,4,He knows whatever is in the skies and the earth and He knows that which you hide and that which you make public and Allah is the Knower of what the bosoms (hearts) possess
  64,5,Has not the news come to you of those who did not believe before (you)? So they tasted the evil result of their affair and for them there is a painful punishment
  64,6,"That was because there came to them their messengers with clear proofs but they said, “Shall human beings guide us?” So they became infidels and turned away, therefore Allah (too) became unconcerned and Allah is Independent, Praised"
  64,7,"Those who do not believe, claim that they will never be raised (after their death). Say, “Why not! by my Fosterer! you will definitely be raised, then you will be informed of that which you did and that is easy for Allah.”"
  64,8,So believe in Allah and His messenger and the light which We have sent down and Allah is informed of that which you do
  64,9,"The day He will gather you for the day of gathering, that will be the day of manifestation of misappropriations. And whoever believes in Allah and does righteous work, He will remove from him his evil deeds and He will make him enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, for staying therein for ever. That is the great achievement"
