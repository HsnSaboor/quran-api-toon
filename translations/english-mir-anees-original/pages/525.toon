  52,32,Or do their understandings enjoin them to (utter) this (statement) or are they a rebellious people
  52,33,"Or do they say, “He has invented it?” No, they do not believe"
  52,34,"Then let them bring a statement similar to it, (if the Quran can be invented by any human being and) if they are truthful"
  52,35,Or were they created from nothing (or by no one)? Or were they (themselves their) creators
  52,36,"Or did they create the skies and the earth? No, they have no certainty"
  52,37,Or do they have with them the treasures of your Fosterer? Or are they the managers
  52,38,Or do they have a ladder by (climbing on) which they seek to hear? Then let their listener come with a clear authority
  52,39,Or has He daughters and for you there are sons
  52,40,Or do you ask them for a reward so that they are burdened with a debt
  52,41,Or is (the knowledge of) the unseen with them that they write (it) down
  52,42,"Or do they intend to plot? Then those who do not believe, they (themselves) are under the influence of a plot"
  52,43,Or is there for them a god other than Allah? Glory be to Allah (He is high above) that which they associate as partners (with Him)
  52,44,"And (even) if they see a piece of the sky fall, they would say, “A heaped cloud.”"
  52,45,So leave them till they meet that day of theirs wherein they will fall down senseless
  52,46,"The day their plot will not make them free from anything, nor will they be helped"
  52,47,"And for those who are unjust, there will certainly be a punishment besides that, but the majority of them does not know"
  52,48,"So wait patiently for the command of your Fosterer, for you are certainly before Our eyes. And glorify your Fosterer by praising (Him) at the time you rise"
  52,49,and in the night glorify Him and after (the disappearance of) the stars
