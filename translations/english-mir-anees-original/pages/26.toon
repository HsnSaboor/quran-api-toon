quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,170,"And when it is said to them, \"Follow that which Allah has sent down,\" they say, \"No, we will follow that on which we found our fathers.\" What ! even if their fathers were not having understanding of anything and had not received guidance"
  2,171,"And the likeness of those who do not believe is as the likeness of one who calls out to (something) which hears nothing except a call and a cry, deaf, dumb, blind, so they do not understand"
  2,172,"O you who believe ! eat of the good (things) which We have provided for you and be grateful to Allah, if it is He alone Whom you serve"
  2,173,"Forbidden to you is only (that which is) dead and blood and flesh of swine and that over which (a name) other than that of Allah has been invoked; but if anyone is driven to necessity (being helplessly forced to eat), neither desiring it nor revolting, then there is no sin on him, Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving , Merciful"
  2,174,"Those who hide that which Allah has sent down of the book and take for it a small price, those are certainly the persons who do not swallow into their stomachs (anything) but fire, and Allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection nor will He purify them and for them there will be a painful punishment"
  2,175,"Those are the persons who purchase error at the cost of guidance and punishment at the cost of protective forgiveness. Then, what patience they (must) have over the fire"
  2,176,"That is because Allah has sent down the book containing the truth, and those who disagree about the book are certainly in opposition, very far off (from the truth)"
