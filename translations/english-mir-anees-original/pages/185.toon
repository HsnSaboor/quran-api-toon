quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,62,"And if they intend to deceive you, then Allah is certainly sufficient for you. He it is Who strengthened you with His help and with the believers"
  8,63,"and He put unity in their hearts. Had you spent all that is in the earth (even then) you would not have been able to put unity in their hearts, but Allah has put unity among them. He is certainly Mighty, Wise"
  8,64,O prophet ! Allah is sufficient for you and those who follow you from among the believers
  8,65,"O prophet ! rouse the believers to fight, if there are twenty patient ones of you, they shall overcome two hundred and if there are a hundred of you, they shall overcome a thousand of those who do not believe because they are a people who do not understand"
  8,66,"For the present Allah has lightened for you (the responsibility) as He knows that there is weakness in you. So if there are a hundred patient ones of you they shall overcome two hundred and if there are a thousand of you, they shall overcome two thousand by the order of Allah and Allah is with those who are patient"
  8,67,"It does not befit a prophet that he should have prisoners (of war, his purpose is to fight) to the extent that he totally dominates in the land (so as to establish his religion). You intend (to have the) apparent good of the world while Allah intends (good for you in) the hereafter and Allah is Mighty, Wise"
  8,68,"Had an ordinance from Allah not gone forth earlier, a great punishment would have befallen you due to that which you took"
  8,69,"So eat of the lawful good things from that which you took as spoils of war and fear Allah, Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
