quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,137,This is nothing but a customary (warning) of the ancient
  26,138,and we will not be punished
  26,139,"Thus they denied him, therefore We destroyed them, there is certainly a sign in that, but the majority of them does not believe"
  26,140,"And your Fosterer, He is certainly the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,141,The (people of) Samood denied the messengers
  26,142,"when their brother Saleh said to them, \"Will you not guard (against evil)"
  26,143,I am certainly a trustworthy messenger to you
  26,144,so fear Allah and obey me
  26,145,"And I do not ask you for any reward for it, my reward is with none but the Fosterer of the worlds"
  26,146,Will you be left secure in that which is here
  26,147,in gardens and springs
  26,148,"and cultivations and date palms, the spathes of which break (due to the weight of the fruit)"
  26,149,And you exultingly carve houses out of mountains
  26,150,so fear Allah and obey me
  26,151,and do not obey the command of the extravagant
  26,152,who cause corruption in the earth and do not act aright
  26,153,"They said, \"You are only one of the bewitched,* * One under the influence of magic"
  26,154,"you are nothing but a man like us, so bring a sign if you are of the truthful ones"
  26,155,"He said, \"This is a she-camel, for it there (is a portion of water for) drinking and for you (a portion of water for) drinking on a known day"
  26,156,And do not afflict her with evil lest the punishment of a great day seize you
  26,157,But they stabbed her then became regretters
  26,158,"So the punishment seized them, there is certainly a sign in that, but the majority of them does not believe"
  26,159,"And your Fosterer, He is certainly the Mighty, the Merciful. (R)"
