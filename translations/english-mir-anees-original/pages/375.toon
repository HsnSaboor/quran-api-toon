quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,184,and fear Him Who created you and the ancient generations
  26,185,"They said, \"You are only one of the bewitched"
  26,186,"and you are nothing but a man like us, and our guess about you is that you are of those who lie"
  26,187,Then make pieces from the sky to fall on us if you are of the truthful ones
  26,188,"He said, \"My Fosterer knows best about what you do"
  26,189,"So they denied him therefore the punishment of the over shadowing cloud seized them, it was certainly a punishment of a great day"
  26,190,"There is certainly a sign in that, but the majority of them does not believe"
  26,191,"And your Fosterer, He is certainly the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,192,And the (Quran) has certainly been sent down by the Fosterer of the worlds
  26,193,the trustworthy spirit came down with it
  26,194,on your heart that you may be (one) of the warners
  26,195,in plain Arabic language
  26,196,and it is (mentioned) in ancient scriptures (too)
  26,197,Is it not a sign for them that the learned (men among) the children of Israel know it
  26,198,And had We sent it down on any of the foreigners
  26,199,"and had he recited it to them, they would not have believed in it"
  26,200,Thus did We cause it to enter into the hearts of the criminals
  26,201,(that) they should not believe in it till they see the painful punishment
  26,202,which will come upon them suddenly while they are not conscious
  26,203,"then they will say, \"Shall we be given time (for amendment)"
  26,204,What ! do they still seek to hasten on Our punishment
  26,205,Then do you see? If We make them enjoy for years
  26,206,then there comes to them that which they were promised
