  9,29,"Fight with those who do not believe in Allah and in the period hereafter nor do they make unlawful that which Allah and His messenger have made unlawful nor do they adopt as their religion, the religion of truth (Islam), from among those who were given the book, till they pay by hand the jizya * and they (accept that they) are in a subdued state. * Tax taken from non-Muslims in an Islamic state for providing them full protection"
  9,30,"And the Jews say, \"Uzair is the son of Allah,\" and the Christians say, \"The Messiah is the son of Allah.\" That is their saying with their mouths, they imitate the saying of those who did not believe earlier, may Allah destroy them, how they are turned away (from the truth)"
  9,31,"They have taken their priests and monks as their fosterers besides Allah and (also) the Messiah, the son of Maryam; and they were not commanded (anything) except to serve one God. There is no god except Him, be He glorified above that which they associate as partners (with Him)"
