quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  21,1,(The time for giving) an account of their deeds has come near for mankind yet they turn away in heedlessness
  21,2,There does not come to them (anything) new from the reminder of their Fosterer but they hear it while playing
  21,3,"their hearts (being involved) in pastime. And those who are unjust talk in secret, \"Is this (person something) other than a man like yourselves? Why do you then come to magic while you see?”"
  21,4,"Say, \"My Fosterer knows what is spoken in the sky and the earth and He is the Hearing, the Knowing"
  21,5,"No ! they say, \"Confused dreams, no, he forged it, no, he is a poet, so let him bring to us a sign like that which was sent through the earlier (prophets)"
  21,6,"No city which We destroyed before them believed, so will they believe"
  21,7,"And We sent before you only men, to whom We communicated, so ask people who remember if you do not know"
  21,8,"And We did not make for them bodies which did not eat food, and they were not those who stayed (as immortals)"
  21,9,Then We fulfilled Our promise to them and delivered them and him whom We willed and We destroyed those who committed excesses
  21,10,"We have sent down to you the book in which (there is) a reminder (for) you, will you not then understand? (R)"
