quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,"No, you prefer the life of this world"
  87,17,while the hereafter is better and that which remains
  87,18,This is certainly there in the earlier books (too)
  87,19,books of lbrahim and Musa
  88,1,Have the details of the happenings on the (day of the final) covering come to you
  88,2,Faces on that day will be downcast
  88,3,"labouring, weary"
  88,4,entering very hot fire
  88,5,being made to drink from boiling spring
  88,6,There will be no food for them except that from the thorn tree
  88,7,It will neither be nourishable by them nor will it make them free from hunger
  88,8,(Other) faces that day will be happy
  88,9,pleased on account of the effort they had put in earlier
  88,10,(They will be) in a high garden
  88,11,therein you will not hear useless talk
  88,12,therein is a flowing spring
  88,13,therein are raised couches
  88,14,and drinking cups placed ready (for use)
  88,15,and cushions set in rows
  88,16,and carpets spread
  88,17,So do they not see towards the camel how it is created
  88,18,and towards the sky how it is raised
  88,19,and towards the mountains how they are rooted
  88,20,and towards the earth how it is spread
  88,21,"So remind, you are only to remind"
  88,22,You are not in authority over them
  88,23,But one who turns away and does not believe
  88,24,so he will be punished by Allah with a great punishment
  88,25,Their return is certainly towards Us
  88,26,"then certainly, it is on Us to take their account"
