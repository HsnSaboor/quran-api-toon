quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  22,1,"The day you will see it, every mother giving suck will forget that which she suckled (i.e her child), and every pregnant woman will lay down her burden, and you will see mankind intoxicated though they will not be intoxicated, but the punishment of Allah will be severe"
  22,2,And among mankind is he who disputes regarding Allah without knowledge and follows every rebellious devil
  22,3,"It is written down about him (devil): whoever turns to him for friendship, he will certainly mislead him and he will guide him to the punishment of the blazing fire"
  22,4,"O mankind ! if you are in doubt about the resurrection, then We certainly created you from the soil, then from the sperm, then from that which clings and hangs like a leech, then from (a thing like) chewed flesh in proportion and out of proportion . (This description is given so) that We may make clear to you (the process of your birth). And We cause to stay in the wombs that which We will, till an appointed term, then We bring you out as infants, then (you grow) so as to reach your full strength (of maturity). And among you is he who is caused to die (young), and among you is he who is brought back to (that) worst part of life (i.e. old age), that (even) after having (had) knowledge, he does not know anything. And you see the earth barren, then when We send down water on it, it stirs and swells and puts forth every kind of beautiful growth"
  22,5,"That is because, Allah is the Reality, and it is He Who gives life to the dead and He certainly has power over everything"
