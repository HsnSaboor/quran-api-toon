quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,39,"who were driven out of their houses unjustly, only because they said, \"Our Fosterer is Allah.\" And had Allah not repelled some people by others (then) cloisters and churches and synagogues and mosques wherein Allah's name is remembered much, would have surely been pulled down. And Allah will definitely help him who helps Him, Allah is certainly Strong, Mighty"
  22,40,"Those who, if We establish them in the earth, would establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and enjoin that which is recognized (as good) and forbid that which is not recognized (as good). And it is for Allah (to decide) the results of affairs"
  22,41,"And if they deny you, then before them, the people of Nuh and Aad and Samood had also denied"
  22,42,along with the people of Ibrahim and people of Lut
  22,43,and the inhabitants of Midian. And Musa was also denied; so I gave to the infidels time (for amending themselves) then caught them. Then how was My rejection (of them)
  22,44,"So how many a town did We destroy while it was unjust, so it fell down on its roofs with (many a) deserted well and lofty palace reduced in size"
  22,45,"Then did they not travel in the earth so as to have hearts (minds) with which they could understand or ears with which they could hear? Then certainly, the eyes are not blind but the hearts, that are in the bosoms, are blind"
  22,46,"And they ask you to hasten on the punishment and Allah never goes against His promise, and a day with your Fosterer is certainly like a thousand years of what you number"
