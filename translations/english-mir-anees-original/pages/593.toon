quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the dawn
  89,2,and the ten nights
  89,3,and the even and the odd
  89,4,and the night when it travels
  89,5,"For one who has sense, these (items) are surely worth being sworn by"
  89,6,Did you not see how your Fosterer dealt with Aad
  89,7,"people of Iram, possessors of (lofty buildings supported by) pillars"
  89,8,the like of which was not created in (other) cities
  89,9,and Samood who cut the rocks in the valley
  89,10,"and Firawn, possessor of pegs"
  89,11,who rebelled in the cities
  89,12,Thus they increased corruption in them
  89,13,So your Fosterer poured on them a portion of the punishment
  89,14,Your Fosterer is certainly watchfully waiting
  89,15,"So as for man, whenever his Fosterer tries him by honouring him and favouring him, then he says, “My Fosterer has honoured me.”"
  89,16,"And as for (the situation) when He tries him by straitening on him his provision, he says, “My Fosterer has disgraced me.”"
  89,17,"No, but the orphan is not honoured by you"
  89,18,and you do not urge one another on the feeding of the poor
  89,19,"and you eat off the inheritance, eating it greedily"
  89,20,and you love wealth with intense love
  89,21,"No, when the earth is crushed to level it in a level"
  89,22,and your Fosterer comes with the angels in rank after rank
  89,23,"so on that day, hell will be brought near, (and) on that day man will be mindful. But his being mindful (on that day) will be of no use to him"
