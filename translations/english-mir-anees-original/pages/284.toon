quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  17,18,"Whoever intends (the comfort of the life of this world) which hasten away, We hasten it for him therein what We will (and) for whom We intend, then We appoint hell for him, he will enter it disgraced, driven away"
  17,19,"And whoever intends (to achieve the benefits of) the hereafter and strives for it (with the) striving (due for) it while he is a believer, then those are the persons whose striving will be acknowledged"
  17,20,"We help all, these as well as those, from the bounty of your Fosterer, and the bounty of your Fosterer is not confined"

  17,24,"and lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and say , “My Fosterer ! have mercy on them in a manner similar to the manner in which they fostered me when I was a small (child).”"
