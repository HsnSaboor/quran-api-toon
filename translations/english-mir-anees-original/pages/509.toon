quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"And those who believe say, “Why is not a sura, (a chapter of the Quran) sent down?” But when a decisive sura is sent down and fighting is mentioned therein, you see those in whose hearts is a disease, looking at you with a look of one who is fainting because of death, so sorrowful is their state"
  47,21,"(What is required is) obedience and a recognised (good) word. Then when the affair is determined, then if they be truthful to Allah, that would be better for them"
  47,22,"But if you held command, is it not possible that you will cause corruption in the earth and cut off the ties of your relationships"
  47,23,Those are the persons whom Allah has cursed so He has made them deaf and blinded their eyes
  47,24,Do they not then reflect on the Quran or are there locks on their hearts
  47,25,"Those who turn on their backs after (receiving) the guidance which has been made clear to them, the devil has certainly inclined them (away from the Quran) while giving them (false) hopes"
  47,26,"That is because, they say to those who dislike that which Allah has sent down, “We will obey you in some of the affairs,” and Allah knows their secrets"
  47,27,"Then how will it be when the angels will take them back (by causing them to die), striking their faces and their backs"
  47,28,"That is because, they followed that which displeased Allah and disliked pleasing Him, therefore He made their deeds fruitless"
  47,29,"Or do those in whose hearts is a disease think, that Allah will not expose their bad intentions"
