quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  72,1,"Say: It is communicated to me that a party of the jinn heard (the Quran) and said, “We have heard a wonderful Quran"
  72,2,"It guides to the right way, so we have believed in it and we will never associate any partner with our Fosterer"
  72,3,"And Exalted be the Majesty of our Fosterer, He has not taken a wife or a son"
  72,4,And the foolish among us used to say unjust (things) about Allah
  72,5,And we thought that mankind and jinn never speak a lie against Allah
  72,6,And persons from among human beings used to seek protection of persons from among the jinn so they increased them in error
  72,7,And they (too) thought as you thought that Allah will never raise anyone (to life after death)
  72,8,And we searched the sky but found it filled with strong guards and flames
  72,9,"And we used to sit in some of the sitting places thereof to hear, but now whoever hears, he finds a flame waiting for him"
  72,10,And we do not know whether evil is intended for those who are in the earth or their Fosterer intends (to guide) them to the right way
  72,11,"And among us are those who are righteous and among us (are those who are) other than that, we are sects following different traditions"
  72,12,And we know that we can neither defeat Allah in the earth nor can we defeat Him by flight
  72,13,"And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it, so whoever believes in his Fosterer, he should neither fear loss nor error"
