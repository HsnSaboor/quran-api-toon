quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  43,11,"And He Who sent down water from the sky according to a programme, then We raise ( to life ) therewith a dead land, thus, you ( too ) will be brought out"
  43,12,"And He Who created pairs of all ( things ) and made for you the ships, and from among the cattle , those on which you ride"
  43,13,"that you may balance yourselves on their backs, then remember the favour of your Fosterer on you when you balance yourselves on them and say, “Glorified be He Who has subjected these to us ( for our use ) and we were not able to do it"
  43,14,and we will certainly return to our Fosterer.”
  43,15,"And they assign to Him from His servants, a part ( as sons, daughters, partners, etc), man to be certain is clearly ungrateful"
  43,16,What ! has He taken daughters from what He has created and chosen sons for you
  43,17,"And when one of them is given the news of ( the birth of a daughter, something ) similar to that which he assigns to the Beneficent ( Allah ), his face is shadowed black and he is full of grief"
  43,18,What ! ( do they assign to Allah daughters ) who are brought up in ornaments and who are without clarity during a dispute
  43,19,"And they regard the angels, who are servants of the Beneficent ( Allah ), ( as ) females. Did they witness their creation? Their evidence will be recorded and they will be questioned"
  43,20,"And they say, “If the Beneficent ( Allah ) had willed, we would not have worshipped them.” They do not have any knowledge about that, they do nothing but guess"
  43,21,Or did We give them a book before this so that they are holding fast to it
  43,22,"No, they say, “We found our fathers on ( these ) religious procedures and we are guided by their footsteps.”"
