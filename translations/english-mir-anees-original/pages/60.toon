quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,78,"And from among them there is a party who twist their tongues (in such a manner while reading) the book that you certainly consider it (to be) from the book, although it is not from the book, and they say it is from Allah though it is not from Allah and they speak a lie against Allah while they know"
  3,79,"It is not (possible) for a man that Allah should give him the book and wisdom and prophet hood, then he should say to people, \"Be my servants (worshippers) besides Allah,\" but (he would say), \"You be servants of the Fosterer because you teach the book and because you study (it)"
  3,80,And neither would he command you that you should take the angels and prophets as fosterers. What ! would he command you to be infidels after you have submitted (as Muslims)
  3,81,"And when Allah took a pledge from the prophets, \"Behold ! that which I give you of the book and wisdom, then (when) there comes to you a messenger confirming that which is with you, you must definitely believe in him and you must definitely help him (probably by propagating the news of the coming of prophet Muhammed, among their respective followers).\" He asked, \"Do you agree and do you accept My burden (responsibility) concerning this (matter)?\" They replied, \"We agree.\" He said, \"Then bear witness and I am (also) with you from among those who bear witness"
  3,82,"So whoever turns back after this, then those only are the transgressors"
  3,83,"What ! do they seek a religion other than the religion of Allah, when to Him submits whoever (and whatever) is in the skies and the earth willingly and unwillingly and towards Him they will be returned"
