quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  9,94,"They will present their excuse to you when you return to them, say, \"Present no excuse, we will not believe you, Allah has given us your news (by) informing us. And Allah and His messenger will see your work, then you will be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen then you will be informed by Him of that which you used to do"
  9,95,"They will swear to you by Allah when you return to them that you may keep away from them, so keep away from them, for they are unclean and their settling place is hell, a reward for that which they used to earn"
  9,96,"They will swear to you that you may be pleased with them, but (even) if you are pleased with them, Allah is certainly not pleased with the transgressing people"
  9,97,"The desert Arabs are stronger in infidelity and hypocrisy and more fitted for not knowing the limits which Allah has sent down to His messenger, and Allah is Knowing, Wise"
  9,98,"And of the desert Arabs are those who take that which they spend, as a fine, and wait for some evil turns of fortune to (fall on) you. May the evil turn of fortune be on them and Allah is Hearing, Knowing"
  9,99,"And of the desert Arabs is he who believes in Allah and the period hereafter and takes that which he spends as a means of nearness to Allah and for obtaining the prayers of the messenger. Beware ! that is certainly a means of nearness for them, Allah will make them enter into His mercy. Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
