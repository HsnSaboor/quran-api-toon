quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He (Muhammed) frowned and turned his back
  80,2,that the blind man came to him
  80,3,And what will make you realize that he might have purified himself
  80,4,"or be reminded, so that (your) reminding might have profited him"
  80,5,As for him who is carefree (wealthy)
  80,6,"to him then, you pay attention"
  80,7,"And if he does not purify himself, the responsibility is not on you"
  80,8,And as for him who comes to you striving hard
  80,9,and he fears
  80,10,from him you are distracted
  80,11,"No, it is certainly a reminder"
  80,12,so whoever wills let him remember it
  80,13,(It is) in pages honoured
  80,14,"elevated, clean"
  80,15,in the hands of writers
  80,16,"honoured, virtuous"
  80,17,"Perished be man, how ungrateful he is"
  80,18,From what thing did He create him
  80,19,"He created him from a sperm, then programmed him (to follow a certain path)"
  80,20,"then, He eased that path for him"
  80,21,Then He causes him to die then buries him
  80,22,"Then, when He wills, He will raise him"
  80,23,"No, he has not done that which He commanded him to do"
  80,24,So let man look at his food
  80,25,How We pour water in the form of rain
  80,26,"then We split the earth, (with) a splitting"
  80,27,"then We cause to grow therein, grain"
  80,28,and grapes and green fodder
  80,29,and olive trees and date palms
  80,30,and dense gardens
  80,31,and fruits and herbage
  80,32,A provision for you and for your cattle
  80,33,Then when the deafening sound comes
  80,34,(it will be) a day when man will run away from his brother
  80,35,and his mother and his father
  80,36,and his wife and his sons
  80,37,"on that day, for everyone of them there will be enough concern to keep him unconcerned with others"
  80,38,(Some) faces on that day will be bright
  80,39,"laughing, rejoicing at the good news"
  80,40,(while other) faces on that day will have dust over them
  80,41,being covered with darkness
  80,42,"Those are the infidels, the transgressors"
