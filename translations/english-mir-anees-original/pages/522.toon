quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"He said, “Then what is your affair (for which you have been sent) O you messengers?”"
  51,32,"They said, “We are sent to a criminal people"
  51,33,that we may send upon them (porous) stones of clay
  51,34,marked from your Fosterer for (the punishment of) the extravagant.”
  51,35,Then We brought out those who believed from among them
  51,36,but We did not find therein any Muslims except (in) one house
  51,37,And We left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment
  51,38,And in Musa (there is a sign) when We sent him to Firawn with clear authority
  51,39,"But he turned away with his force and said, “A magician or one influenced by the jinn.”"
  51,40,So We caught him and his army and threw them into (the flowing water of) the sea and he was blameworthy
  51,41,And in Aad (there is a sign) when We sent on them the barren wind (for their destruction)
  51,42,It did not leave anything with which it came (in contact) without making it as if decomposed
  51,43,"And in Samood (there is a sign) when it was said to them, “Enjoy till a (set) time.”"
  51,44,"But they revolted against the command of their Fosterer, so the thunderbolt took hold of them while they were seeing"
  51,45,So they were not able to stand nor were they able to defend themselves
  51,46,"And the people of Nuh earlier (to them), they (too) were a transgressing people"
  51,47,"And the sky, We constructed it with energy, and We are the Expanders (of it)*. * See notes under Ch. 21, Vs"
  51,48,"And the earth, We have spread it. How Excellent are We in making it habitable"
  51,49,And of everything We have created pairs that you may be mindful
  51,50,"So you all run towards Allah, I am a clear warner for you from Him"
  51,51,"And do not set up another god with Allah, I am a clear warner for you from Him"
