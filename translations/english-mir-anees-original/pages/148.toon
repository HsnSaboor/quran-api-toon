quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,147,"So if they deny you, then say, \"Your Fosterer is the Possessor of omnipresent mercy, but His punishment will not be turned away from people who are criminals"
  6,148,"Those who associate partners (with Allah) will say, \"Had Allah willed we would not have associated partners (with Allah) nor our forefathers nor we would have made anything unlawful (by ourselves).\" Thus did those before them deny, till they tasted Our punishment. Say, \"Do you have any knowledge, then bring it out for us, you follow nothing but conjecture and you do nothing but lie"
  6,149,"Say, \"Then Allah's is the argument (that makes one) reach (the final conclusion); so had He willed He would have guided all of you"
  6,150,"Say, \"Come, bring your witnesses who should bear witness that Allah has made this unlawful.\" But if they bear witness, you do not bear witness with them, and do not follow the desires of those who deny Our signs and those who do not believe in the hereafter and make (others) equal to their Fosterer"
  6,151,"Say, \"Come I will read to you that which your Fosterer has made unlawful for you: (It is unlawful) that you should associate any partner with Him. And (you) should be good to parents and you should not kill your children because of (the fear of) poverty, We provide for you and for them too, and (you) should not go near indecencies (both) those of them which are open and those which are secret and (you) should not kill a soul (anyone, the killing of) whom Allah has made unlawful except in the cause of justice. That He directs you with, that you may understand"
