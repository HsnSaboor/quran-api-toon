quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,41,And O my people! how is it that I invite you towards safety while you invite me towards the fire
  40,42,"You invite me for not believing in Allah, and to associate with Him (things), about which I do not have knowledge, while I invite you towards the Mighty, the Protectively Forgiving"
  40,43,"Assuredly, that towards which you invite me, is itself not fit to be prayed to in this world or in the hereafter, and our turning is towards Allah, and the extravagant, they will be the inhabitants of the fire"
  40,44,"then you will remember what I had said to you, and I entrust my affair to Allah, Allah is certainly a Seer of (His) servants"
  40,45,So Allah saved him from the evil of that which they planned and an evil punishment engulfed Firawn’s people
  40,46,"The fire, they are presented before it morning and evening, and the day the hour of doom will be established ( it will be said ), “Make the people of Firawn enter the severest punishment.”"
  40,47,"And when they will dispute with each other in the fire, the weak will say to those who considered themselves great, “We were your followers, so will you make us free form a portion of the fire?”"
  40,48,"Those who considered themselves great will say, “We all are in it, Allah has certainly judged between ( His ) servants.”"
  40,49,"And those in the fire will say, to the guards of hell, “Pray to your Fosterer to lighten for us (at least for) a day ( something ) of the punishment.”"
