quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  7,105,(It is) incumbent upon (me) that I should not speak anything about Allah except the truth. I have come to you with clear proof from your Fosterer so send the children of Israel with me
  7,106,"He (Firawn) said, \"If you have come with a sign (from Allah) then bring it, if you are of the truthful"
  7,107,"So he (Musa) threw his staff, when it became a clear serpent"
  7,108,"and he drew forth his hand, when it became white for those who were seeing"
  7,109,"The leaders of Firawn's people said, \"This is certainly a learned magician"
  7,110,"he intends to drive you out of your land, so what do you advise"
  7,111,"They said, \"Keep him and his brother (waiting in) hope, meanwhile send collectors into the cities"
  7,112,that they may come to you with every learned magician
  7,113,"And the magicians came to Firawn, saying, \"There should certainly be a reward for us if we are victors"
  7,114,"He said, \"Yes, and you will be of those who are near (to me)"
  7,115,"They said, \"O Musa ! will you throw (show your magic first) or shall we be the first to throw"
  7,116,"He said, \"You throw (first).\" So when they threw, they cast a magic on the eyes of the people and sought to frighten them, and they came out with a great magic"
  7,117,"And We communicated to Musa that: \"Throw your staff,\" so when it swallowed that which they had falsely devised"
  7,118,the truth was established and what they did was falsified
  7,119,Thus they were defeated there and they returned degraded
  7,120,And the magicians were made to fall down prostrate
