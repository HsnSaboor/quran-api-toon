quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  4,20,"And if you intend to exchange one wife in the place of another and if you have given one of them (even) a treasure, then do not take (back) anything from it. Would you take it (back) by slander * and manifest sin? * A false report to injure someone’s reputation"
  4,21,And how can you take it (back) when one of you has gone into the other and they have taken from you a strong pledge
  4,22,"And do not marry those women whom your fathers had married, (there is an) exception to what has already happened in the past, it was certainly indecent and hateful and an evil way"
  4,23,"Forbidden to you (for marriage) are your mothers and your daughters and your sisters and your father's sisters and your mother's sisters and your brothers daughters and your sisters' daughters and your mothers who have suckled you and your foster sisters and your mothers-inlaw and your step daughters under your guardianship (born) of your wives unto whom you have gone in, but if you have not gone in unto them, then there is no sin on you (in marrying them), and (also forbidden) are the wives of your sons who are from your own loins and that you have (at a time) two sisters together (in your wedlock), (there is an) exception to what has already happened in the past, Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"
