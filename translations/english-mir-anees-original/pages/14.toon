quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,89,"And when there came to them a book from Allah confirming that which is with them, though earlier they were seeking a victory over those who did not believe, but when there came to them that which they have recognized, they rejected it, so the curse of Allah is on the infidels"
  2,90,"Evil is that for which they sell themselves, by rejecting that which Allah has sent down, being oppressed that Allah sends down from His grace (the book) on whom He wills from among His servants. Therefore they became deserving of anger upon anger, and for the infidels there is a disgraceful punishment"
  2,91,"And when it is said to them, \"Believe in that which Allah has sent down,\" they say, \"We believe in that which was sent down upon us.\" And they do not believe in that which comes after it, though it is the truth, confirming that which is with them. Say, \"Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah earlier, if you were believers?\" \" And they do not believe in that which comes after it, though it is the truth, confirming that which is with them. Say, \"Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah earlier, if you were believers"
  2,92,"And Musa had come to you with clear proofs, then after him you took the calf (for worship) and you were unjust"
  2,93,"And when We took a pledge from you and raised the mountain above you (saying), \"Hold with strength that which We have given you and listen.\" They said, \"We hear and we disobey.\" And they were made to drink into their hearts (the worship of) the calf because of their infidelity. Say, \"Evil is that which your belief enjoins you, if you are believers"
