quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye
  54,51,"And indeed, We have destroyed your likes; then is there any that will remember"
  54,52,And everything they have done is noted in Az-Zubur
  54,53,"And everything, small and large, is written down"
  54,54,"Verily, those who have Taqwa, will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers"
  54,55,"In a seat of truth, near the Muqtadir King"
  55,1,Ar-Rahman
  55,2,He has taught the Qur'an
  55,3,He created man
  55,4,He taught him Al-Bayan
  55,5,The sun and the moon (run) on fixed courses
  55,6,And the Najm and the trees prostrating
  55,7,"And the heaven He has raised high, and He has set up the balance"
  55,8,In order that you may not transgress the balance
  55,9,And observe the weight with equity and do not make the balance deficient
  55,10,And the earth He has put down (laid) for Al-An'am
  55,11,"Therein are fruits, date palms producing Akmam"
  55,12,"And also corn, with (its) `Asf, and Rayhan"
  55,13,Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny
  55,14,He created man from sounding clay like the clay of pottery
  55,15,And the Jinn He created from a smokeless flame of fire
  55,16,Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny
