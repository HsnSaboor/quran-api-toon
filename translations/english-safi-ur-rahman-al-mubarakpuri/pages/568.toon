quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,"So, no friend has he here this Day"
  69,36,Nor any food except filth from Ghislin
  69,37,None will eat it except the Khati'un
  69,38,"So, I swear by whatsoever you see"
  69,39,And by whatsoever you see not
  69,40,That this is verily the word of an honored Messenger
  69,41,"It is not the word of a poet, little is that you believe"
  69,42,"Nor is it the word of a soothsayer, little is that you remember"
  69,43,This is the revelation sent down from the Lord of all that exists
  69,44,And if he had forged a false saying concerning Us
  69,45,We surely would have seized him by his right hand
  69,46,And then We certainly would have cut off Al-Watin from him
  69,47,And none of you could have prevented it from him
  69,48,"And verily, this is a Reminder for those who have Taqwa"
  69,49,"And verily, We know that there are some among you that deny"
  69,50,And indeed it will be an anguish for the disbelievers
  69,51,"And verily, it (this Qur'an) is an absolute truth with certainty"
  69,52,"So, glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most Great"
  70,1,A questioner asked concerning a torment about to befall
  70,2,"Upon the disbelievers, which none can avert"
  70,3,"From Allah, the Lord of the ways of ascent"
  70,4,The angels and the Ruh ascend to Him in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years
  70,5,"So be patient, with a good patience"
  70,6,"Verily, they see it (the torment) afar off"
  70,7,But We see it near
  70,8,The Day that the sky will be like the Al-Muhl
  70,9,And the mountains will be like `Ihn
  70,10,And no friend will ask a friend
