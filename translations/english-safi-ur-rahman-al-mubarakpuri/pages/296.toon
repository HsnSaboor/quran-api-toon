quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,21,"And thus We made their case known, that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour. (Remember) when they (the people) disputed among themselves about their case, they said: \"Construct a building over them; their Lord knows best about them,\" (then) those who won their point said: \"We verily, shall build a place of worship over them"
  18,22,"They say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them; and they say they were five, the dog being the sixth, guessing at the unseen; and they say they were seven, and the dog being the eighth. Say: \"My Lord knows best their number; none knows them but a few.\" So debate not except with the clear proof. And consult not any of them (about the people of the Cave)"
  18,23,"And never say of anything, \"I shall do such and such thing tomorrow"
  18,24,"Except (with the saying), \"If Allah wills!\" And remember your Lord when you forget and say: \"It may be that my Lord guides me to a nearer way of truth than this"
  18,25,"And they stayed in their cave three hundred years, adding nine"
  18,26,"Say: \"Allah knows best how long they stayed. With Him is the unseen of the heavens and the earth.\" How clearly He sees, and hears (everything)! They have no protector other than Him, and He makes none to share in His decision and His rule"
  18,27,"And recite what has been revealed to you (O Muhammad) of your Lord's Book. None can change His Words, and none will you find as refuge other than Him"
