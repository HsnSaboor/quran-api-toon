quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,49,"Say: \"The truth has come, and the falsehood can neither create anything nor resurrect"
  34,50,"Say: \"If (even) I go astray, I shall stray only to my own loss. But if I remain guided, it is because of the Revelation of my Lord to me. Truly, He is All-Hearer, Ever Near"
  34,51,"And if you could but see, when they will be terrified with no escape, and they will be seized from a near place"
  34,52,"And they will say: \"We do believe (now);\" but how could they receive (Tanawush) from a place so far off"
  34,53,"Indeed they did disbelieve before (in this world), and they (used to) conjecture about the Unseen, from a far place"
  34,54,"And a barrier will be set between them and that which they desire, as was done in the past with the people of their kind. Verily, they have been in grave doubt"
  35,1,"All praise is due to Allah, Fatir of the heavens and the earth, Who made the angels messengers with wings, two or three or four. He increases in creation what He wills. Verily, Allah is Able to do all things"
  35,2,"Whatever of mercy, Allah may grant to mankind, none can withhold it; and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it thereafter. And He is the Almighty, the All-Wise"
  35,3,O mankind! Remember the grace of Allah upon you! Is there any creator other than Allah who provides for you from the sky (rain) and the earth La ilaha illa Huwa. How then are you turning away (from Him)
