quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,40,"And (remember) the Day when He will gather them all together, then He will say to the angels: \"Was it you that these people used to worship"
  34,41,"They (the angels) will say: \"Glorified be You! You are our Protector instead of them. Nay, but they used to worship the Jinn; most of them were believers in them"
  34,42,"So Today, none of you can profit or harm one another. And We shall say to those who did wrong: \"Taste the torment of the Fire which you used to deny"
  34,43,"And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, they say: \"This is naught but a man who wishes to hinder you from that which your fathers used to worship.\" And they say: \"This is nothing but an invented lie.\" And those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them: \"This is nothing but evident magic"
  34,44,"And We had not given them Scriptures that they could study, nor sent to them before you any warner"
  34,45,And those before them denied; these have not received even a tenth of what We had granted to those (of old); yet they denied My Messengers. Then how (terrible) was My denial
  34,46,"Say: \"I exhort you to one (thing) only, that you stand up for Allah's sake in pairs and singly, and reflect, there is no madness in your companion. He is only a warner to you in face of a severe torment"
  34,47,"Say: \"Whatever wage I might have asked of you is yours. My wage is from Allah only, and He is a Witness over all things"
  34,48,"Say: \"Verily, my Lord sends down the truth, the All-Knower of the Unseen"
