quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,But no! Rather you love the present life of this world
  75,21,And neglect the Hereafter
  75,22,Some faces that Day shall be Nadirah
  75,23,Looking at their Lord
  75,24,And some faces that Day will be Basirah
  75,25,Thinking that some calamity is about to fall on them
  75,26,"Nay, when it rea- ches to the collarbones"
  75,27,"And it will be said: \"Who can cure him"
  75,28,And he will think that it was the parting
  75,29,And one shank will be joined with another shank
  75,30,The drive will be on that Day to your Lord
  75,31,"So, he neither believed nor prayed"
  75,32,"But on the contrary, he denied and turned away"
  75,33,Then he walked in conceit to his family admiring himself
  75,34,Woe to you! And then woe to you
  75,35,"Again, woe to you! And then woe to you"
  75,36,Does man think that he will be left neglected
  75,37,Was he not a Nutfah of semen emitted
  75,38,Then he became an `Alaqah; then shaped and fashioned in due proportion
  75,39,"And made of him two sexes, male and female"
  75,40,"Is it not so then, that He would be able to give life to the dead"
  76,1,"Has there not been over man a period of time, when he was not a thing worth mentioning"
  76,2,"Verily, We have created man from Nutfah Amshaj, in order to try him, so, We made him hearer and seer"
  76,3,"Verily, We guided him to the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful"
  76,4,"Verily, We have prepared for the disbelievers iron chains, iron collars, and Sa`ir"
  76,5,"Verily, the Abrar (righteous believers) shall drink of a cup mixed with Kafur"
