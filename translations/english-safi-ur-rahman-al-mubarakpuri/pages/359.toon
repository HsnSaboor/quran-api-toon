quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  24,62,"The believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger; and when they are with him on some common matter, they go not away until they have asked his permission. Verily, those who ask your permission, those are they who (really) believe in Allah and His Messenger. So if they ask your permission for some affairs of theirs, give permission to whom you will of them, and ask Allah for their forgiveness. Truly, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  24,63,"Make not the calling of the Messenger among you as your calling one of another. Allah knows those of you who slip away under shelter. And let those beware who oppose the Messenger's commandment, lest some Fitnah should befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them"
  24,64,"Certainly, to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Indeed, He knows your condition and the Day when they will be brought back to Him, then He will inform them of what they did. And Allah is All-Knower of everything"
  25,1,Blessed be He Who sent down (Nazzala) the criterion to His servant that he may be a warner to all nations
  25,2,"He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Who has begotten no son and for Whom there is no partner in the dominion. He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements"
