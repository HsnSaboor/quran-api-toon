quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"But they denied him, so they will certainly be brought forth"
  37,128,Save the chosen servants of Allah
  37,129,And We left for him among the later generations
  37,130,Salam (peace!) be upon Ilyasin
  37,131,"Verily, thus do We reward the doers of good"
  37,132,"Verily, he was one of Our believing servants"
  37,133,"And verily, Lut was one of the Messengers"
  37,134,"When We saved him and his family, all"
  37,135,Except an old woman (his wife) who was among those who remained behind
  37,136,Then We destroyed the rest
  37,137,"Verily, you pass by them in the morning"
  37,138,And at night; will you not then reflect
  37,139,"And verily, Yunus was one of the Messengers"
  37,140,When he ran to the laden ship
  37,141,"Then he (agreed to) cast lots, and he was among the losers"
  37,142,Then a (big) fish swallowed him as he had done an act worthy of blame
  37,143,Had he not been of them who glorify Allah
  37,144,He would have indeed remained inside its belly (the fish) till the Day of Resurrection
  37,145,But We cast him forth on the naked shore while he was sick
  37,146,And We caused a plant of gourd to grow over him
  37,147,And We sent him to a hundred thousand (people) or even more
  37,148,And they believed; so We gave them enjoyment for a while
  37,149,"Now ask them: \"Are there (only) daughters for your Lord and sons for them"
  37,150,Or did We create the angels female while they were witnesses
  37,151,"Verily, it is of their falsehood that they say"
  37,152,"Allah has begotten.\" And, verily, they are liars"
  37,153,Has He (then) chosen daughters rather than sons
