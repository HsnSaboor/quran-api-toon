quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,102,"Such is Allah, your Lord! None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Creator of all things. So worship Him (alone), and He is the Guardian over all things"
  6,103,"No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. He is the Most Subtle, Well-Acquainted (with all things)"
  6,104,"Verily, Basa'ir (proofs) have come to you from your Lord, so whosoever sees, will do so for (the good of) himself, and whosoever blinds himself, will do so against himself, and I am not a Hafiz over you"
  6,105,"Thus We explain variously the verses so that they (the disbelievers) may say: \"You have Darasta (studied)\" and that We may make the matter clear for the people who have knowledge"
  6,106,"Follow what has been inspired (revealed) to you from your Lord, none has the right to be worshipped but He, and turn aside from the idolators"
  6,107,"Had Allah willed, they would not have taken others besides Him in worship. And We have not made you Hafiz over them nor are you set over them to dispose of their affairs"
  6,108,"And insult not those whom they worship besides Allah, lest they insult Allah wrongfully without knowledge. Thus We have made fair seeming to each people its own doings; then to their Lord is their return and He shall inform them of all that they used to do"
  6,109,"And they swear their strongest oaths by Allah, that if there came to them a sign, they would surely believe therein. Say: \"Signs are but with Allah and what will make you perceive that (even) if it came, they will not believe"
  6,110,"And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away, as they refused to believe therein for the first time, and We shall leave them in their trespass to wander blindly"
