quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"Those who wait and watch about you; if you gain a victory from Allah, they say: \"Were we not with you\" But if the disbelievers gain a success, they say (to them): \"Did we not gain mastery over you and did we not protect you from the believers\" Allah will judge between you (all) on the Day of Resurrection. And never will Allah grant to the disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the believers"
  4,142,"Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but it is He Who deceives them. And when they stand up for Salah, they stand with laziness and to be seen of men, and they do not remember Allah but little"
  4,143,"(They are) swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these nor to those; and he whom Allah sends astray, you will not find for him a way"
  4,144,O you who believe! Do not take disbelievers as friends instead of believers. Do you wish to offer Allah a manifest Sultan against yourselves
  4,145,"Verily, the hyprocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire; no helper will you find for them"
  4,146,"Except those who repent, do righteous good deeds, depend on Allah, and purify their religion for Allah, then they will be with the believers. And Allah will grant the believers a great reward"
  4,147,"Why should Allah punish you if you have thanked (Him) and have believed in Him. And Allah is Ever All-Appreciative (of good), All-Knowing"
