quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"And if We send a wind, and they see it turn yellow -- behold, they then would become unthankful (disbelievers)"
  30,52,"So verily, you cannot make the dead to hear, nor can you make the deaf to hear the call, when they show their backs and turn away"
  30,53,"And you cannot guide the blind from their straying; you can make to hear only those who believe in Our Ayat, and have submitted (to Allah in Islam)"
  30,54,"Allah is He Who created you in weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness and grey hair. He creates what He wills. And He is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful"
  30,55,"And on the Day that the Hour will be established, the criminals will swear that they stayed not but an hour -- thus were they ever deluded"
  30,56,"And those who have been bestowed with knowledge and Faith will say: \"Indeed you have stayed according to the decree of Allah, until the Day of Resurrection; so this is the Day of Resurrection, but you knew not"
  30,57,"So, on that Day no excuse of theirs will avail those who did wrong, nor will they be allowed to return to seek (Allah's) pleasure"
  30,58,"And indeed We have set forth for mankind, in this Qur'an every kind of parable. But if you bring to them any sign or proof, the disbelievers are sure to say (to the believers): \"You follow nothing but falsehood and magic"
  30,59,Thus does Allah seal up the hearts of those who know not
  30,60,"So be patient. Verily, the promise of Allah is true; and let not those who have no certainty of faith discourage you (from conveying Allah's Message)"
