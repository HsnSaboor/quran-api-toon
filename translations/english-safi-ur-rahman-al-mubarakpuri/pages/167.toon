quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,138,"And We brought the Children of Israel (with safety) across the sea, and they came upon a people devoted to some of their idols (in worship). They said: \"O Musa! Make for us a god as they have gods.\" He said: \"Verily, you are an ignorant people"
  7,139,"[Musa added:] \"Verily, these people will be destroyed for that which they are engaged in (idols' worship). And all that they are doing is in vain"
  7,140,"He said: \"Shall I seek for you an ilah (a god) other than Allah, while He has given you superiority over the nations"
  7,141,"And (remember) when We rescued you from Fir`awn's people, who were afflicting you with the worst torment, killing your sons and letting your women live. And in that was a great trial from your Lord"
  7,142,"And We appointed for Musa thirty nights and added ten, and he completed the term, appointed by his Lord, of forty nights. And Musa said to his brother Harun: \"Replace me among my people, act in the right way and follow not the way of the mischief-makers"
  7,143,"And when Musa came at the time and place appointed by Us, and his Lord (Allah) spoke to him; he said: \"O my Lord! Show me (Yourself), that I may look upon You.\" Allah said: \"You cannot see Me, but look upon the mountain; if it stands still in its place then you shall see Me.\" So when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He made it collapse to dust, and Musa fell down unconscious. Then when he recovered his senses he said: \"Glory be to You, I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers"
