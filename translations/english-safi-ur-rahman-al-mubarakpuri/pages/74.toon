quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,181,"Indeed, Allah has heard the statement of those who say: \"Truly, Allah is poor and we are rich!\" We shall record what they have said and their killing of the Prophets unjustly, and We shall say: \"Taste you the torment of the burning (Fire)"
  3,182,"This is because of that which your hands have sent before you. And certainly, Allah is never unjust to (His) servants"
  3,183,"Those who said: \"Verily, Allah has taken our promise not to believe in any Messenger unless he brings to us an offering which the fire (from heaven) shall devour. \" Say: \"Verily, there came to you Messengers before me, with Al-Bayinat and even with with what you speak of; why then did you kill them, if you are truthful"
  3,184,"Then if they reject you, so were Messengers rejected before you, who came with Al-Bayinat and the Scriptures and the Book of Enlightenment"
  3,185,"Everyone shall taste death. And only on the Day of Resurrection shall you be paid your wages in full. And whoever is moved away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is successful. The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception"
  3,186,"You shall certainly be tried and tested in your wealth and properties and in yourselves, and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you (Jews and Christians) and from those who ascribe partners to Allah; but if you persevere patiently, and have Taqwa, then verily, that will be a determining factor in all affairs"
