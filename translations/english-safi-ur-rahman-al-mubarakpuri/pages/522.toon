quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"(Ibrahim) said: \"Then for what purpose you have come, O messengers"
  51,32,"They said: \"We have been sent to a people who are criminals"
  51,33,To send down upon them stones of clay
  51,34,Marked by your Lord for transgressors
  51,35,So We brought out from therein the believers
  51,36,But We found not there any household of the Muslims except one
  51,37,And We have left there a sign for those who fear the painful torment
  51,38,"And in Musa, when We sent him to Fir`awn with a manifest authority"
  51,39,"But (he) turned away along with his hosts, and said: \"A sorcerer or a madman"
  51,40,"So We took him and his armies, and dumped them into the sea (Yamm), for he was blameworthy"
  51,41,And in `Ad when We sent against them the barren wind
  51,42,"It spared nothing that it reached, but blew it into broken spreads of rotten ruins"
  51,43,"And in Thamud, when they were told: \"Enjoy yourselves for a while"
  51,44,"But they insolently defied the command of their Lord, so the Sa`iqah overtook them while they were looking"
  51,45,"Then they were unable to rise up, nor could they help themselves"
  51,46,"(So were) the people of Nuh before them. Verily, they were a people who were rebellious"
  51,47,"With Hands We constructed the heaven. Verily, We are able to expand the vastness of space thereof"
  51,48,And We have made the earth a Firash; how excellent spreader (thereof) are We
  51,49,"And of everything We have created pairs, that you may remember"
  51,50,"So, flee to Allah. Verily, I am a plain warner to you from Him"
  51,51,"And set not up any other god along with Allah. Verily, I am a plain warner to you from Him"
