quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  7,31,"O Children of Adam! Take your adornment to every Masjid, and eat and drink, but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allah) likes not the wasteful"
  7,32,"Say: \"Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allah, which He has produced for His servants, and At-Tayyibat (good things) of sustenance\" Say: \"They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and) exclusively for them (believers) on the Day of Resurrection.\" Thus We explain the Ayat in detail for people who have knowledge"
  7,33,"Say: \"(But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are the Fawahish (immoral deeds) whether committed openly or secretly, and Ithm, and transgression without right, and joining partners with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge"
  7,34,"And every Ummah has its appointed term; when their term comes, neither can they delay it nor can they advance it an hour (or a moment)"
  7,35,"O Children of Adam! If there come to you Messengers from among you, reciting to you My Ayat, then whosoever has Taqwa and becomes righteous, on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve"
  7,36,"But those who reject Our Ayat and treat them with arrogance, they are the dwellers of the Fire, they will abide therein forever"
  7,37,"Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Ayat For such their appointed portion will reach them from the Book (of Decrees) until Our messengers (the angel of death and his assistants) come to them to take their souls, they (the angels) will say: \"Where are those whom you used to invoke and worship besides Allah,\" they will reply, \"They have vanished and deserted us.\" And they will bear witness against themselves, that they were disbelievers"
