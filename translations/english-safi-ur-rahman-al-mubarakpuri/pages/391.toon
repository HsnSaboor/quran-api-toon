quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,44,"And you were not on the western side (of the Mount), when We made clear to Musa the commandment, and you were not among the witnesses"
  28,45,"But We created generations, and long were the ages that passed over them. And you were not a dweller among the people of Madyan, reciting Our Ayat to them. But it is We Who kept sending (Messengers)"
  28,46,"And you were not at the side of At-Tur when We called. But (you are sent) as a mercy from your Lord, to give warning to a people to whom no warner had come before you, in order that they may remember or receive admonition"
  28,47,"And if (We had) not (sent you to the people of Makkah) in case a calamity should seize them for what their hands have sent forth, they would have said: \"Our Lord! Why did You not send us a Messenger We would then have followed Your Ayat and would have been among the believers"
  28,48,"But when the truth has come to them from Us, they say: \"Why is he not given the like of what was given to Musa Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Musa of old\" They say: \"Two kinds of magic, each helping the other!\" And they say: \"Verily, in both we are disbelievers"
  28,49,"Say: \"Then bring a Book from Allah, which is a better guide than these two, that I may follow it, if you are truthful"
  28,50,"But if they answer you not, then know that they only follow their own lusts. And who is more astray than one who follows his own lusts, without guidance from Allah Verily, Allah guides not the people who are wrongdoers"
