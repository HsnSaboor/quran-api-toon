quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,16,"Those who say: \"Our Lord! We have indeed believed, so forgive us our sins and save us from the punishment of the Fire"
  3,17,"(They are) the patient, the true believers, and obedient with sincere devotion in worship to Allah. Those who spend [in good] and those who pray and beg Allah's pardon in the last hours of the night"
  3,18,"Allah bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped but He, and the angels, and those having knowledge (also bear witness to this); (He always) maintains His creation in justice. None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Almighty, the All-Wise"
  3,19,"Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam. Those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) did not differ except out of rivalry, after knowledge had come to them. And whoever disbelieves in the Ayat of Allah, then surely, Allah is Swift in reckoning"
  3,20,"So if they dispute with you say: \"I have submitted myself to Allah, and (so have) those who follow me.\" And say to those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and to those who are illiterate (Arab pagans): \"Do you (also) submit yourselves\" If they do, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the Message; and Allah sees the servants"
  3,21,"Verily, those who disbelieve in the Ayat of Allah and kill the Prophets without right, and kill those men who order just dealings, then announce to them a painful torment"
  3,22,"They are those whose works will be lost in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers"
