quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,27,"Then after that Allah will accept the repentance of whom He wills. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  9,28,"O you who believe! Verily, the Mushrikin are impure. So let them not come near Al-Masjid Al-Haram after this year; and if you fear poverty, Allah will enrich you if He wills, out of His bounty. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  9,29,"Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth among the People of the Scripture, until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued"
  9,30,"And the Jews say: \"Uzayr (Ezra) is the son of Allah,\" and the Christians say: \"The Messiah is the son of Allah.\" That is their saying with their mouths, resembling the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime. May Allah fight them, how they are deluded away from the truth"
  9,31,"They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allah, and (they also took as their Lord) the Messiah, son of Maryam, while they were commanded to worship none but One God, none has the right to be worshipped but He. Praise and hallowed be He above what they associate (with Him)"
