quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,58,"And when you proclaim the call for the Salah, they take it (but) as a mockery and fun; that is because they are a people who understand not"
  5,59,"Say: \"O People of the Scripture! Do you criticize us for no other reason than that we believe in Allah, and in what has been sent down to us and in that which has been sent down before (us), and that most of you are rebellious"
  5,60,"Say: \"Shall I inform you of something worse than that, regarding the recompense from Allah: those who incurred the curse of Allah and His wrath, and those of whom He transformed into monkeys and swine, and those who worshipped Taghut; such are worse in rank, and far more astray from the straight path"
  5,61,"When they come to you, they say: \"We believe.\" But in fact they enter with disbelief and they go out with the same. And Allah knows all that they were hiding"
  5,62,"And you see many of them hurrying for sin and transgression, and eating illegal things. Evil indeed is that which they have been doing"
  5,63,Why do not the Rabbaniyyun and the Ahbar forbid them from uttering sinful words and from eating illegal things. Evil indeed is that which they have been performing
  5,64,"The Jews say: \"Allah's Hand is tied up.\" Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends as He wills. Verily, the revelation that has come to you from your Lord makes many of them increase in rebellion and disbelief. We have put enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguished it; and they (ever) strive to make mischief on the earth. And Allah does not like the mischief-makers"
