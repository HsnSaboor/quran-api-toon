quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,62,"They swear by Allah to you (Muslims) in order to please you, but it is more fitting that they should please Allah and His Messenger, if they are believers"
  9,63,"Know they not that whoever opposes and shows hostility to Allah and His Messenger, certainly for him will be the fire of Hell to abide therein. That is the extreme disgrace"
  9,64,"The hypocrites fear lest a Surah should be revealed about them, showing them what is in their hearts. Say: \"(Go ahead and) mock! But certainly Allah will bring to light all that you fear"
  9,65,"If you ask them (about this), they declare: \"We were only talking idly and joking.\" Say: \"Was it at Allah, and His Ayat and His Messenger that you were mocking"
  9,66,"Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others among you because they were criminals"
  9,67,"The hypocrites, men and women, are one from another; they enjoin evil, and forbid the good, and they close their hands. They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them. Verily, the hypocrites are the rebellious"
  9,68,"Allah has promised the hypocrites -- men and women -- and the disbelievers, the fire of Hell; therein shall they abide. It will suffice them. Allah has cursed them and for them is the lasting torment"
