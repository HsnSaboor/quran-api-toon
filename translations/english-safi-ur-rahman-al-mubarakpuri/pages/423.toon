quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,"It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error"
  33,37,"And (remember) when you said to him on whom Allah has bestowed grace and you have done a favor: \"Keep your wife to yourself, and have Taqwa of Allah.\" But you did hide in yourself that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him. So, when Zayd had completed his aim with her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them. And Allah's command must be fulfilled"
  33,38,There is no blame on the Prophet in that which Allah has made legal for him. That has been Allah's way with those who have passed away of old. And the command of Allah is a decree determined
  33,39,"Those who convey the Message of Allah and fear Him, and fear none save Allah. And sufficient is Allah as a Reckoner"
  33,40,"Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last of the Prophets. And Allah is Ever All-Aware of everything"
  33,41,O you who believe! Remember Allah with much remembrance
  33,42,And glorify His praises morning and Asila
  33,43,"He it is Who sends Salah on you, and His angels too, that He may bring you out from darkness into light. And He is Ever Most Merciful to the believers"
