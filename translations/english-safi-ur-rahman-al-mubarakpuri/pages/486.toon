quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  42,23,"That is whereof Allah gives glad tidings to His servants who believe and do righteous good deeds. Say: \"No reward do I ask of you for this except to be kind to me for my kinship with you.\" And whoever earns a good righteous deed, We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate"
  42,24,"Or say they: \"He has invented a lie against Allah\" If Allah willed, He could have sealed up your heart. And Allah wipes out falsehood, and establishes the truth by His Word. Verily, He knows well what are in the breasts"
  42,25,"And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do"
  42,26,"And He answers those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and gives them increase of His bounty. And as for the disbelievers, theirs will be a severe torment"
  42,27,"And if Allah were to extend the provision for His servants, they would surely rebel in the earth, but He sends down by measure as He wills. Verily, He is, in respect of His servants, the Well-Aware, the All-Seer"
  42,28,"And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired, and spreads His mercy. And He is the Wali, Worthy of all praise"
  42,29,"And among His Ayat is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and whatever moving creatures He has dispersed in them both. And He is Able to assemble them whenever He wills"
  42,30,"And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much"
  42,31,"And you cannot escape from Allah in the earth, and besides Allah you have neither any protector nor any helper"
