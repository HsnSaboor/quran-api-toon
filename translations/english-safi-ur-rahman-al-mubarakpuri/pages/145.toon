quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,132,For all there will be degrees according to what they did. And your Lord is not unaware of what they do
  6,133,"And your Lord is Al-Ghani, full of mercy; if He wills, He can destroy you; and in your place make whom He wills as your successors, as He raised you from the seed of other people"
  6,134,"Surely, that which you are promised, will verily come to pass, and you cannot escape"
  6,135,"Say: \"O my people! Work according to your way, surely, I too am working, and you will come to know for which of us will be the (happy) end in the Hereafter. Certainly the wrongdoers will not be successful"
  6,136,"And they assign to Allah a share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah,\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their \"partners\" reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their \"partners\"! Evil is the way they judge"
  6,137,"And so to many of the idolators, their \"partners\" have made fair seeming the killing of their children, in order to lead them to their own destruction and cause confusion in their religion. And if Allah had willed, they would not have done so. So leave them alone with their fabrications"
