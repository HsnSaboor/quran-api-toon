quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  46,6,"And when mankind are gathered, they (false deities) will become their enemies and will deny their worship"
  46,7,"And when Our Clear Ayat are recited to them, the disbelievers say of the truth when it reaches them: \"This is plain magic"
  46,8,"Or say they: \"He has fabricated it.\" Say: \"If I have fabricated it, still you have no power to support me against Allah. He knows best of what you say among yourselves concerning it! Sufficient is He as a witness between me and you! And He is the Oft--Forgiving, the Most Merciful"
  46,9,"Say: \"I am not a new thing among the Messengers, nor do I know what will be done with me or you. I only follow that which is revealed to me, and I am but a plain warner"
  46,10,"Say: \"Tell me! If it was from Allah and you disbelieved it, (at the same time), a witness from among the Children of Israel has testified to something similar and believed while you rejected (the truth)!\" Verily, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people"
  46,11,"And those who disbelieve say of those who believe: \"Had it been a good thing, they (the poor believers) would not have preceded us to it!\" And when they have not been guided by it, they say: \"This is ancient falsehood"

  46,13,"Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is (only) Allah,\" and thereafter stand firm, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve"
  46,14,"Such shall be the dwellers of Paradise, abiding therein (forever) -- a reward for what they used to do"
