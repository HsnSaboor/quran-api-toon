  41,21,"And they will say to their skins, \"Why do you testify against us\" They will say: \"Allah has caused us to speak - as He causes all things to speak, and He created you the first time, and to Him you are made to return"
  41,22,"And you have not been hiding yourselves (in the world), lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should testify against you; but you thought that Allah knew not much of what you were doing"
  41,23,"And that thought of yours which you thought about your Lord, has brought you to destruction; and you have become of those utterly lost"
  41,24,"Then, if they bear the torment patiently, then the Fire is the home for them, and if they seek to please Allah, yet they are not of those who will ever be allowed to please Allah"
  41,25,"And We have assigned for them intimate companions (in this world), who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them. And the Word is justified against them as it was justified against those who were among the previous generations of Jinn and men that had passed away before them. Indeed they (all) were the losers"
  41,26,"And those who disbelieve say: \"Listen not to this Qur'an, and make noise in the midst of its (recitation) that you may overcome"

  41,28,"That is the recompense of the enemies of Allah: the Fire. Therein will be for them the eternal home, a recompense for that they used to deny Our Ayat"
  41,29,"And those who disbelieve will say: \"Our Lord! Show us those among Jinn and men who led us astray, that we may crush them under our feet so that they become the lowest"
