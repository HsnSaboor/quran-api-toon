quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  13,6,"They ask you to hasten the evil before the good, while exemplary punishments have indeed occurred before them. But verily, your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind, in spite of their wrongdoing. And verily, your Lord is (also) severe in punishment"
  13,7,"And the disbelievers say: \"Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord\" You are only a warner, and to every people there is a guide"
  13,8,"Allah knows what every female bears, and by how much the wombs fall short (of their time or number) or exceed. Everything with Him is in (due) proportion"
  13,9,"All-Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Most Great, the Most High"
  13,10,"It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day"
  13,11,"For him (each person), there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the command of Allah. Verily, Allah will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves. But when Allah wills a people's punishment, there can be no turning it back, and they will find besides Him no protector"
  13,12,"It is He Who shows you the lightning, as a fear and as a hope. And it is He Who brings up the clouds, heavy (with water)"
  13,13,"And Ar-Ra'd (thunder) glorifies and praises Him, and so do the angels because of His awe. He sends the thunderbolts, and therewith He strikes whom He wills, yet they (disbelievers) dispute about Allah. And He is Mighty in strength and Severe in punishment"
