quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  7,12,"(Allah) said: \"What prevented you (O Iblis) that you did not prostrate, when I commanded you\" Iblis said: \"I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire, and him You created from clay"
  7,13,"(Allah) said: \"(O Iblis) get down from this (Paradise), it is not for you to be arrogant here. Get out, for you are of those humiliated and disgraced"
  7,14,"(Iblis) said: \"Allow me respite till the Day they are raised up (the Day of Resurrection)"
  7,15,"(Allah) said: \"You are of those respited"
  7,16,"(Iblis) said: \"Because You have `Aghwaytni', surely, I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your straight path"
  7,17,"Then I will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of them to be thankful"
  7,18,"(Allah) said (to Iblis): \"Get out from this (Paradise), Madh'uman Madhura. Whoever of them (mankind) will follow you, then surely, I will fill Hell with you all"
  7,19,"And O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in Paradise, and eat thereof as you both wish, but approach not this tree otherwise you both will be of the wrongdoers"
  7,20,"Then Shaytan whispered suggestions to them both in order to uncover that which was hidden from them of their private parts (before); he said: \"Your Lord did not forbid you this tree save you should become angels or become of the immortals"
  7,21,"And he Qasamahuma: \"Verily, I am one of the sincere well-wishers for you both"
  7,22,"So he misled them with deception. Then when they tasted of the tree, that which was hidden from them of their shame (private parts) became manifest to them and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise. And their Lord called out to them (saying): \"Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you: Verily, Shaytan is an open enemy unto you"
