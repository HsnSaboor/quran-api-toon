quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,109,And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And all matters go back (for decision) to Allah
  3,110,"You are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma`ruf (all that Islam has ordained) and forbid Al-Munkar (all that Islam has forbidden), and you believe in Allah. And had the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) believed, it would have been better for them; among them are some who have faith, but most of them are Fasiqun (rebellious)"
  3,111,"They will do you no harm, barring a trifling annoyance; and if they fight against you, they will show you their backs, and they will not be helped"
  3,112,"They are stricken with humility wherever they may be, except when under a covenant (of protection) from Allah, and a covenant from men; they have drawn on themselves the wrath of Allah, and destitution is put over them. This is because they disbelieved in the Ayat of Allah and killed the Prophets without right. This is because they disobeyed (Allah) and used to transgress (the limits set by Allah)"
  3,113,"Not all of them are alike; a party of the People of the Scripture stand for the right, they recite the verses of Allah during the hours of the night, prostrating themselves in prayer"
  3,114,They believe in Allah and the Last Day; they enjoin Al-Ma`ruf and forbid Al-Munkar; and they hasten in (all) good works; and they are among the righteous
  3,115,"And whatever good they do, nothing will be rejected of them; for Allah knows well the Muttaqin (the pious)"
