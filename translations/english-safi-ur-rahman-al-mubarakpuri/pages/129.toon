  6,9,"And had We appointed him an angel, We indeed would have made him a man, and We would have certainly caused them confusion in a matter which they have already covered with confusion"
  6,10,"And indeed Messengers were mocked before you, but their scoffers were surrounded by the very thing that they used to mock at"
  6,11,"Say: \"Travel in the land and see what was the end of those who rejected truth"
  6,12,"Say: \"To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth\" Say: \"To Allah.\" He has prescribed mercy for Himself. Indeed He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt. Those who destroy themselves will not believe"
  6,13,"And to Him belongs whatsoever exists in the night and the day, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing"
  6,14,"Say: \"Shall I take as a guardian any other than Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth And it is He Who feeds but is not fed.\" Say: \"Verily, I am commanded to be the first of those who submit. \"And be not you of the idolators"
  6,15,"Say: \"I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the torment of a Mighty Day"
