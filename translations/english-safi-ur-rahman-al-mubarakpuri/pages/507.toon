quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"Those who disbelieve and hinder (men) from the path of Allah, He will render their deeds vain"
  47,2,"But those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and believe in that which is sent down to Muhammad -- for it is the truth from their Lord -- He expiates from them their sins and amends their Bal"
  47,3,"That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, while those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus does Allah set forth for mankind their parables"
  47,4,"So, when you meet those who disbelieve (in battle), smite (their) necks until you have fully defeated them, then tighten their bonds. Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity or ransom, until the war lays down its burden. Thus, and had Allah so willed, He could have taken vengeance against them;--but (He lets you struggle) so as to test with one another. But those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost"
  47,5,He will guide them and amend their condition
  47,6,"And admit them to Paradise, which He has made known to them"
  47,7,"O you who believe! If you support (in the cause of) Allah, He will support you, and make your foothold firm"
  47,8,"But as for those who disbelieve, misery awaits them, and (Allah) will make their deeds vain"
  47,9,That is because they hate that which Allah has sent down; so He has made their deeds fruitless
  47,10,"Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what happened in the end to those before them Allah destroyed them completely, and a similar (awaits) the disbelievers"
  47,11,"That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe, whereas the disbelievers have no protector"
