quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,29,"Then, when Musa had fulfilled the term, and was traveling with his family, he saw a fire in the direction of At-Tur. He said to his family: \"Wait, I have seen a fire; perhaps I may bring to you from there some information, or a burning firebrand that you may warm yourselves"
  28,30,"So when he reached it, he was called from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place, from the tree: \"O Musa! Verily, I am Allah, the Lord of all that exists"
  28,31,"And throw your stick!\" But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight, and looked not back. (It was said:) \"O Musa! Draw near, and fear not. Verily, you are of those who are secure"
  28,32,"Put your hand into the opening of your garment, it will come forth white without a disease; and draw your hand close to your side to be free from the fear. These are two proofs from your Lord to Fir`awn and his chiefs. Verily, they are the people who are rebellious"
  28,33,"He said: \"My Lord! I have killed a man among them, and I fear that they will kill me"
  28,34,"And my brother Harun -- he is more eloquent in speech than me, so send him with me as a helper to confirm me. Verily, I fear that they will deny me"
  28,35,"Allah said: \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother, and give you both power, so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our Ayat; you two as well as those who follow you, will be the victors"
