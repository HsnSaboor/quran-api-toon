quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,25,What is the matter with you Why do you not help one another
  37,26,"Nay, but that Day they shall surrender"
  37,27,And they will turn to one another and question one another
  37,28,"They will say: \"It was you who used to come to us from the right side"
  37,29,"They will reply: \"Nay, you yourselves were not believers"
  37,30,And we had no authority over you. Nay! But you were a transgressing people
  37,31,"So now the Word of our Lord has been justified against us, that we shall certainly taste (the torment)"
  37,32,So we led you astray because we were ourselves astray
  37,33,"Then verily, that Day, they will (all) share in the torment"
  37,34,"Certainly, that is how We deal with the criminals"
  37,35,"Truly, when it was said to them: \"La ilaha illallah,\" they puffed themselves up with pride"
  37,36,"And (they) said: \"Are we going to abandon our gods for the sake of a mad poet"
  37,37,Nay! he has come with the truth and he confirms the Messengers
  37,38,"Verily, you are going to taste the painful torment"
  37,39,And you will be requited nothing except for what you used to do
  37,40,Save the chosen servants of Allah
  37,41,For them there will be a known provision
  37,42,Fruits; and they shall be honored
  37,43,In the Gardens of Delight
  37,44,Facing one another on thrones
  37,45,Round them will be passed a cup of pure wine
  37,46,"White, delicious to the drinkers"
  37,47,Neither will they have Ghawl from that nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom
  37,48,And beside them will be Qasirat-At-Tarf with (wide and beautiful) eyes
  37,49,as if they were Bayd Maknun
  37,50,"Then they will turn to one another, mutually questioning"
  37,51,"A speaker of them will say: \"Verily, I had a companion (in the world)"
