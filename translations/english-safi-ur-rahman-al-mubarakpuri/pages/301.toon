quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  18,62,"So when they passed further on, Musa said to his boy-servant: \"Bring us our morning meal; truly, we have suffered Nasaban in this, our journey"
  18,63,"He said: \"Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock I indeed forgot the fish; none but Shaytan made me forget to remember it. It took its course into the sea in a strange (way)"
  18,64,"[Musa] said: \"That is what we have been seeking.\" So they went back retracing their footsteps"
  18,65,"Then they found one of Our servants, on whom We had bestowed mercy from Us, and whom We had taught knowledge from Us"
  18,66,"Musa said to him: \"May I follow you so that you teach me something of that knowledge which you have been taught (by Allah)"
  18,67,"He said: \"Verily, you will not be able to have patience with me"
  18,68,And how can you have patience about a thing which you know not
  18,69,"Musa said: \"If Allah wills, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in aught"
  18,70,"He said: \"Then, if you follow me, ask me not about anything till I myself mention of it to you"
  18,71,"So they both proceeded, till, when they boarded the boat, he (Khidr) damaged it. Musa said: \"Have you damaged it wherein its people will drown Verily, you have committed a thing Imr"
  18,72,"He said: \"Did I not tell you, that you would not be able to have patience with me"
  18,73,"He said: \"Call me not to account for what I forgot, and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you)"
  18,74,"Then they both proceeded till they met a boy, and he (Khidr) killed him. Musa said: \"Have you killed an innocent person without Nafs Verily, you have committed a thing Nukr"
