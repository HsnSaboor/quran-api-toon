quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  13,29,"Those who believed, and work righteousness, Tuba is for them and a beautiful place of (final) return"
  13,30,"Thus have We sent you to a community before whom other communities have passed away, in order that you might recite unto them what We have revealed to you, while they disbelieve in the Most Gracious (Allah). Say: \"He is my Lord! None has the right to be worshipped but He! In Him is my trust, and to Him I turn"
  13,31,"And if there had been a Qur'an with which mountains could be moved (from their places), or the earth could be cloven asunder, or the dead could be made to speak (it would not have been other than this Qur'an). But the decision of all things is certainly with Allah. Have not then those who believed yet known that had Allah willed, He could have guided all mankind And a disaster will not cease to strike those who disbelieved because of their (evil) deeds or it (i.e. the disaster) settles close to their homes, until the promise of Allah comes to pass. Certainly, Allah breaks not His promise"
  13,32,"And indeed (many) Messengers were mocked at before you but I granted respite to those who disbelieved, and finally I punished them. Then how (terrible) was My punishment"
  13,33,"Is then He (Allah) Who takes charge of every person and knows all that he has earned (like any other deity who knows nothing) Yet, they ascribe partners to Allah. Say: \"Name them! Is it that you will inform Him of something He knows not in the earth or is it (just) a show of false words.\" Nay! To those who disbelieved, their plotting is made fair-seeming, and they have been hindered from the right path; and whom Allah sends astray, for him there is no guide"
  13,34,"For them is a torment in the life of this world, and certainly, harder is the torment of the Hereafter. And they have no defender (or protector) against Allah"
