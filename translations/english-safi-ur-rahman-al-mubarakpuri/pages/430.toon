quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,15,"Indeed there was for Saba' a sign in their dwelling place -- two gardens on the right and on the left; (and it was said to them:) \"Eat of the provision of your Lord, and be grateful to Him.\" A fair land and an Oft-Forgiving Lord"
  34,16,"But they turned away, so We sent against them flood released from the dam, and We converted their two gardens into gardens producing bitter bad fruit, and Athl, and some few lote trees"
  34,17,Like this We requited them because they were ungrateful disbelievers. And never do We requite in such a way except those who are ungrateful (disbelievers)
  34,18,"And We placed, between them and the towns which We had blessed, towns easy to be seen, and We made the stages (of journey) between them easy (saying): \"Travel in them safely both by night and day"
  34,19,"But they said: \"Our Lord! Make the stages between our journey longer,\" and they wronged themselves; so We made them as tales (in the land), and We dispersed them all totally. Verily, in this are indeed signs for every steadfast, grateful (person)"
  34,20,"And indeed Iblis did prove true his thought about them, and they followed him, all except a group of true believers"
  34,21,"And he had no authority over them, -- except that We might test him who believes in the Hereafter, from him who is in doubt about it. And your Lord is Watchful over everything"
  34,22,"Say: \"Call upon those whom you assert besides Allah, they possess not even the weight of a speck of dust, either in the heavens or on the earth, nor have they any share in either, nor there is for Him any supporter from among them"
