quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,"Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled, and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home), by a huge reward"
  4,96,"Degrees of (higher) grades from Him, and forgiveness and mercy. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  4,97,"Verily, as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves, they (angels) say (to them): \"In what (condition) were you\" They reply: \"We were weak and oppressed on the earth.\" They (angels) say: \"Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein\" Such men will find their abode in Hell - what an evil destination"
  4,98,"Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way"
  4,99,"These are they whom Allah is likely to forgive them, and Allah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving"
  4,100,"He who emigrates in the cause of Allah, will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by. And whosoever leaves his home as an emigrant unto Allah and His Messenger, and death overtakes him, his reward is then surely incumbent upon Allah. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  4,101,"And when you Darabtum in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten the Salah if you fear that the disbelievers may put you in trial, verily, the disbelievers are ever unto you open enemies"
