quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,32,"And those who were arrogant will say to those who were deemed weak: \"Did we keep you back from guidance after it had come to you Nay, but you were criminals"
  34,33,"Those who were deemed weak will say to those who were arrogant: \"Nay, but it was your plotting by night and day, when you ordered us to disbelieve in Allah and set up rivals to Him!\" And each of them (parties) will conceal their own regrets, when they behold the torment. And We shall put iron collars round the necks of those who disbelieved. Are they requited aught except what they used to do"
  34,34,"And We did not send a warner to a township but those who were given the worldly wealth and luxuries among them said: \"We believe not in what you have been sent with"
  34,35,"And they say: \"We are more in wealth and in children, and we are not going to be punished"
  34,36,"Say: \"Verily, my Lord expands the provision to whom He wills and restricts, but most men know not"
  34,37,"And it is not your wealth, nor your children that bring you nearer to Us, but only he who believes, and does righteous deeds; as for such, there will be multiple rewards for what they did, and they will reside in the high dwellings (Paradise) in peace and security"
  34,38,"And those who strive against Our Ayat, to frustrate them, they will be brought to the torment"
  34,39,"Say: \"Truly, my Lord expands the provision for whom He wills of His servants, and (also) restricts (it) for him, and whatsoever you spend of anything, He will replace it.\" And He is the Best of those who make provision"
