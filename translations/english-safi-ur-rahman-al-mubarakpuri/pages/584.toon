quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,When his Lord called him in the holy valley of Tuwa
  79,17,"Go to Fir`awn; verily, he has transgressed all bounds"
  79,18,"And say to him: \"Would you purify yourself"
  79,19,"And that I guide you to your Lord, so you should fear Him"
  79,20,Then he showed him the great sign
  79,21,But he denied and disobeyed
  79,22,"Then he turned back, striving"
  79,23,So he gathered and called out
  79,24,"Saying: \"I am your lord, most high"
  79,25,So Allah seized him with punishing example for the Hereafter and the first (life)
  79,26,In this is a lesson for whoever fears
  79,27,Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven that He constructed
  79,28,"He raised its hei- ght, and has perfected it"
  79,29,Its night He covers and He brings out its forenoon
  79,30,And after that He spread the earth
  79,31,And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture
  79,32,And the mountains He has fixed firmly
  79,33,As provision and benefit for you and your cattle
  79,34,But when there comes the Greatest Catastrophe
  79,35,The Day when man shall remember what he strove for
  79,36,And Hell shall be made apparent for whoever sees
  79,37,Then for him who transgressed
  79,38,And preferred the life of this world
  79,39,"Verily, his abode will be the Hell"
  79,40,"But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and forbade himself from desire"
  79,41,"Verily, Paradise will be his abode"
  79,42,They ask you about the Hour when will be its appointed time
  79,43,What do you have to mention of it
  79,44,To your Lord it is limited
  79,45,You are only a warner for those who fear it
  79,46,The Day they see it (it will be) as if they had not tarried (in this world) except an (`Ashiyyah) afternoon or its (Duha) morning
