  3,175,"It is only Shaytan that suggests to you the fear of his friends; so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are indeed believers"
  3,176,"And let not those grieve you who rush with haste to disbelieve; verily, not the least harm will they do to Allah. It is Allah's will to give them no portion in the Hereafter. For them there is a great torment"
  3,177,"Verily, those who purchase disbelief at the price of faith, not the least harm will they do to Allah. For them, there is a painful torment"
  3,178,And let not the disbelievers think that Our postponing their punishment is good for them. We postpone the punishment only so that they may increase in sinfulness. And for them is a disgraceful torment
  3,179,"Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until He distinguishes the wicked from the good. Nor will Allah disclose to you the secrets of the Unseen, but Allah chooses of His Messengers whom He wills. So believe in Allah and His Messengers. And if you believe and have Taqwa of Allah, then for you there is a great reward"
  3,180,"And let not those who are stingy with that which Allah has bestowed on them of His bounty think that it is good for them. Nay, it will be worse for them; the things that they were stingy with shall be tied to their necks like a collar on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah's is the inheritance of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Well-Acquainted with all that you do"
