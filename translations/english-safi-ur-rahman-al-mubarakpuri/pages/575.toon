quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Verily, your Lord knows that you do stand a little less than two-thirds of the night, or half the night, or a third of the night, and also a party of those with you. And Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you are unable to pray the whole night, so He has turned to you. So, recite you of the Qur'an as much as may be easy for you. He knows that there will be some among you sick, others traveling through the land, seeking of Allah's bounty, yet others fighting in Allah's cause. So recite as much of the Qur'an as may be easy"
  74,1,O you enveloped in garments
  74,2,Arise and warn
  74,3,And magnify your Lord
  74,4,And purify your garments
  74,5,And keep away from Ar-Rujz
  74,6,And give not a thing in order to have more
  74,7,And be patient for the sake of your Lord
  74,8,"Then, when the Naqur is sounded"
  74,9,"Truly, that Day will be a Hard Day"
  74,10,Far from easy for the disbelievers
  74,11,Leave Me alone (to deal) with whom I created lonely
  74,12,And then granted him resources in abundance
  74,13,And children attending
  74,14,And made life smooth and comfortable for him
  74,15,After all that he desires that I should give more
  74,16,"Nay! Verily, he has been opposing Our Ayat"
  74,17,I shall force him to Sa`ud
