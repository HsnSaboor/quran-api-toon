quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,"And O my people! I ask of you no wealth for it, my reward is from none but Allah. I am not going to drive away those who have believed. Surely, they are going to meet their Lord, but I see that you are a people that are ignorant"
  11,30,"And O my people! Who will help me against Allah, if I drove them away Will you not then give a thought"
  11,31,"And I do not say to you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor that I know the Ghayb; nor do I say I am an angel, and I do not say of those whom your eyes look down upon that Allah will not bestow any good on them. Allah knows what is in their inner selves. In that case, I should, indeed be one of the wrongdoers"
  11,32,"They said: \"O Nuh! You have disputed with us, and much have you prolonged the dispute with us, now bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful"
  11,33,"He said: \"Only Allah will bring it (the punishment) on you, if He wills, and then you will escape not"
  11,34,"And my advice will not profit you, even if I wish to give you good counsel, if Allah's will is to keep you astray. He is your Lord! and to Him you shall return"
  11,35,"Or they (the pagans of Makkah) say: \"He has fabricated it.\" Say: \"If I have fabricated it, upon me be my crimes, but I am innocent of (all) those crimes which you commit"
  11,36,"And it was revealed to Nuh: \"None of your people will believe except those who have believed already. So be not sad because of what they used to do"
  11,37,"And construct the ship under Our Eyes and with Our revelation, and address Me not on behalf of those who did wrong; they are surely to be drowned"
