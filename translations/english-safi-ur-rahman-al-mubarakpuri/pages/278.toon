  16,95,"And do not use an oath by Allah for the purchase of little value, what is with Allah is better for you if you only knew"
  16,96,"Whatever you have will be exhausted, and what is with Allah will remain. And to those who are patient, We will certainly grant them their rewards in proportion to the best of what they used to do"
