quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By At-Tin and Az-Zaytun
  95,2,By Tur Sinin
  95,3,By this city of security
  95,4,"Verily, We created man in the best form"
  95,5,Then We reduced him to the lowest of the low
  95,6,Save those who believe and do righteous deeds. Then they shall have a reward without end
  95,7,Then what causes you to deny after this the Recompense
  95,8,Is not Allah the best of judges
  96,1,Read! In the Name of your Lord Who created
  96,2,He has created man from a clot
  96,3,Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous
  96,4,Who has taught by the pen
  96,5,He has taught man that which he knew not
  96,6,"Nay! Verily, man does transgress"
  96,7,Because he considers himself self-sufficient
  96,8,"Surely, unto your Lord is the return"
  96,9,Have you seen him who prevents
  96,10,A servant when he prays
  96,11,Have you seen if he is on the guidance
  96,12,Or enjoins Taqwa
  96,13,Have you seen if he denies and turns away
  96,14,Knows he not that Allah sees
  96,15,"Nay! If he ceases not, We will scorch his forehead"
  96,16,"A lying, sinful forehead"
  96,17,Then let him call upon his council
  96,18,We will call out the guards of Hell
  96,19,Nay! Do not obey him. Fall prostrate and draw near (to Allah)
