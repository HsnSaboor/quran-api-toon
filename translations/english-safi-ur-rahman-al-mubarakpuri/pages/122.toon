quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"And when they listen to what has been sent down to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth they have recognized. They say: \"Our Lord! We believe; so write us down among the witnesses"
  5,84,And why should we not believe in Allah and in that which has come to us of the truth And we wish that our Lord will admit us along with the righteous people
  5,85,"So because of what they said, Allah awarded them with Gardens under which rivers flow, they will abide therein forever. Such is the reward of good-doers"
  5,86,"But those who disbelieved and belied Our Ayat, they shall be the dwellers of Hell"
  5,87,"O you who believe! Make not unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful to you, and transgress not. Verily, Allah does not like the transgressors"
  5,88,"And eat of the things which Allah has provided for you, lawful and good, and have Taqwa of Allah in Whom you believe"
  5,89,"Allah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths; for its expiation feed ten poor, on a scale of the Awsat of that with which you feed your own families; or clothe them; or free a slave. But whosoever cannot afford, then he should fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn. And protect your oaths. Thus Allah makes clear to you His Ayat that you may be grateful"
