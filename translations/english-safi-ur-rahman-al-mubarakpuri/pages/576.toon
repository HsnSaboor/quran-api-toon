quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,"Verily, he thought and plotted"
  74,19,"So let him be cursed, how he plotted"
  74,20,"And once more let him be cursed, how he plotted"
  74,21,Then he thought
  74,22,Then he frowned and he looked in a bad tempered way
  74,23,"Then he turned back, and was proud"
  74,24,"Then he said: \"This is nothing but magic from that of old"
  74,25,This is nothing but the word of a human being
  74,26,I will cast him into Saqar
  74,27,And what will make you know (exactly) what Saqar is
  74,28,"It spares not, nor does it leave (anything)"
  74,29,Scorching for the humans
  74,30,Over it are nineteen
  74,31,"And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Fire. And We have fixed their number only as a trial for the disbelievers, in order that the People of the Scripture may arrive at a certainty and that the believers may increase in faith, and that no doubt may be left for the People of the Scripture and the believers, and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the disbelievers may say: \"What does Allah intend by this example\" Thus Allah leads astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And none can know the hosts of your Lord but He. And this is nothing but a reminder to mankind"
  74,32,Nay! And by the moon
  74,33,And by the night when it withdraws
  74,34,And by the dawn when it brightens
  74,35,"Verily, it is but one of the greatest (signs)"
  74,36,A warning to mankind
  74,37,"To any of you that chooses to go forward, or to remain behind"
  74,38,Every person is a pledge for what he has earned
  74,39,Except those on the Right
  74,40,In Gardens they will ask one another
  74,41,About criminals (and they will say to them)
  74,42,What has caused you to enter Hell
  74,43,"They will say: \"We were not of those who used to offer the Salah"
  74,44,Nor did we feed the poor
  74,45,And we used to speak falsehood with vain speakers
  74,46,And we used to deny the Day of Recompense
  74,47,Until Al-Yaqin came to us
