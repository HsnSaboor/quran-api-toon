quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,147,"If they deny you say: \"Your Lord is the Owner of vast mercy, and never will His wrath be turned back from the people who are criminals"
  6,148,"Those who committed Shirk say: \"If Allah had willed, we would not have commited Shirk, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against His will).\" Likewise belied those who were before them, till they tasted Our wrath. Say: \"Have you any knowledge (proof) that you can produce before us Verily, you follow the Zann and you do nothing but lie"
  6,149,"Say: \"With Allah is the perfect proof and argument; had He so willed, He would indeed have guided you all"
  6,150,"Say: \"Bring forward your witnesses, who can testify that Allah has forbidden this.\" Then if they testify, do not testify with them. And do not follow the vain desires of those who belie Our Ayat, and such as believe not in the Hereafter, and they hold others as equal with their Lord"
  6,151,"Say: \"Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with Him; be kind and dutiful to your parents; kill not your children because of poverty -- We provide sustenance for you and for them. Come not near to Al-Fawahish (immoral sins) whether committed openly or secretly; and kill not anyone whom Allah has forbidden, except for a just cause. This He has commanded you that you may understand"
