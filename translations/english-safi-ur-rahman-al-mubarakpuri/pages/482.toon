quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"To Him is referred the knowledge of the Hour. No fruit comes out of its sheath, nor does a female conceive nor brings forth (young), except by His knowledge. And on the Day when He will call unto them (saying): \"Where are My (so-called) partners\" They will say: \"We inform You that none of us bears witness to it"
  41,48,"And those whom they used to invoke before (in this world) shall disappear from them, and they will perceive that they have no place of refuge"
  41,49,"Man does not get tired of asking for good; but if an evil touches him, then he gives up all hope and is lost in despair"
  41,50,"And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from Us, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say: \"This is due to my (merit); I think not that the Hour will be established. But if I am brought back to my Lord, surely there will be for me the best with Him. \"Then, We verily will show to the disbelievers what they have done, and We shall make them taste a severe torment"
  41,51,"And when We show favor to man, he turns away and becomes arrogant; but when evil touches him, then he has recourse to long supplications"
  41,52,"Say: \"Tell me, if it is from Allah, and you disbelieve in it Who is more astray than one who is in opposition far away"
  41,53,"We will show them Our signs in the universes, and within themselves, until it becomes manifest to them that this is the truth. Is it not sufficient in regard to your Lord that He is a Witness over all things"
  41,54,"Lo, Verily, they are in doubt concerning the meeting with their Lord. Verily, He is surrounding all things"
