quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  41,12,"Then He completed and finished their creation (as) seven heavens in two Days and He made in each heaven its affair. And We adorned the nearest (lowest) heaven with lamps (stars) to be an adornment as well as to guard. Such is the decree of Him, the Almighty, the All-Knower"
  41,13,"But if they turn away, then say: \"I have warned you of a Sa`iqah like the Sa`iqah which overtook `Ad and Thamud"
  41,14,"When the Messengers came to them, from before them and behind them (saying): \"Worship none but Allah,\" they said: \"If our Lord had so willed, He would surely have sent down the angels. So, indeed we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent"
  41,15,"As for `Ad, they were arrogant in the land without right, and they said: \"Who is mightier than us in strength\" See they not that Allah Who created them was mightier in strength than them. And they used to deny Our Ayat"
  41,16,"So, We sent upon them a Sarsar wind in days of calamity that We might give them a taste of disgracing torment in this present worldly life. But surely the torment of the Hereafter will be more disgracing, and they will never be helped"
  41,17,"And as for Thamud, We showed them the path of truth but they preferred blindness to guidance; so the Sa`iqah of disgracing torment seized them because of what they used to earn"
  41,18,And We saved those who believed and had Taqwa
  41,19,"And (remember) the Day that the enemies of Allah will be gathered to the Fire, then they will be driven"
  41,20,"Till, when they reach it, their hearing (ears) and their eyes and their skins will testify against them as to what they used to do"
