quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,53,"Thus We have tried some of them with others, that they might say: \"Is it these (poor believers) that Allah has favored from amongst us\" Does not Allah know best those who are grateful"
  6,54,"When those who believe in Our Ayat come to you, say: \"Salamun `Alaykum\" (peace be on you); your Lord has written mercy for Himself, so that, if any of you does evil in ignorance, and thereafter repents and does righteous good deeds, then surely, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  6,55,"And thus do We explain the Ayat in detail, that the way of the criminals, may become manifest"
  6,56,"Say: \"I have been forbidden to worship those whom you invoke (worship) besides Allah.\" Say: \"I will not follow your vain desires. If I did, I would go astray, and I would not be one of the rightly guided"
  6,57,"Say: \"I am on clear proof from my Lord, but you deny it. I do not have what you are hastily seeking (the torment). The decision is only for Allah, He declares the truth, and He is the best of judges"
  6,58,"Say: \"If I had that which you are asking for impatiently (the torment), the matter would have been settled at once between you and I, but Allah knows best the wrongdoers"
  6,59,"And with Him are the keys of the Ghayb (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is on the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but he knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record"
