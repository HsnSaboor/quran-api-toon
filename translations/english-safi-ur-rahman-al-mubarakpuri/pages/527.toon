quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,"Verily, those who believe not in the Hereafter, name the angels with female names"
  53,28,"But they have no knowledge thereof. They follow but conjecture, and verily, conjecture is no substitute for the truth"
  53,29,Therefore withdraw from him who turns away from Our Reminder and desires nothing but the life of this world
  53,30,"That is what they could reach of knowledge. Verily, your Lord is He, Who knows best him who goes astray from His path, and He knows best him who receives guidance"
  53,31,"And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, that He may requite those who do evil with that which they have done, and reward those who do good, with what is best"
  53,32,"Those who avoid great sins and Al-Fawahish (immoral sins) except Al-Lamam -- verily, your Lord is of vast forgiveness. He knows you well when He created you from the earth (Adam), and when you were fetuses in your mothers' wombs. So, ascribe not purity to yourselves. He knows best him who has Taqwa"
  53,33,Did you observe him who turned away (from Islam)
  53,34,"And gave a little, then stopped"
  53,35,Is with him the knowledge of the Unseen so that he sees
  53,36,Or is he not informed with what is in the Suhuf of Musa
  53,37,And of Ibrahim who fulfilled all that
  53,38,That no burdened person (with sins) shall bear the burden (sins) of another
  53,39,And that man can have nothing but what he does
  53,40,And that his deeds will be seen
  53,41,Then he will be recompensed with a full and the best recompense
  53,42,And that to your Lord is the End
  53,43,"And that it is He Who makes laugh, and makes weep"
  53,44,And that it is He Who causes death and gives life
