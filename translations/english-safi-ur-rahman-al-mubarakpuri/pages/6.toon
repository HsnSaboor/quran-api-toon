quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,30,"And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: \"Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth.\" They said: \"Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, ـ while we glorify You with praises and thanks and sanctify You.\" He (Allah) said: \"I know that which you do not know"
  2,31,"And He taught Adam all the names (of everything), then He showed them to the angels and said, \"Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful"
  2,32,"They (angels) said: \"Glory is to You, we have no knowledge except what you have taught us. Verily, You are the Knower, the Wise"
  2,33,"He said: \"O Adam! Inform them of their names,\" and when he had informed them of their names, He said: \"Did I not tell you that I know the Ghayb (unseen) in the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you have been concealing"
  2,34,"And (remember) when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam.\" And they prostrated except Iblis (Shaytan), he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allah)"
  2,35,"And We said: \"O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight, of things therein wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimin (wrongdoers)"
  2,36,"Then the Shaytan made them slip therefrom (the Paradise), and got them out from that in which they were. We said: \"Get you down, all, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time"
  2,37,"Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily, He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the Most Merciful"
