quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,"By the heaven, and At-Tariq"
  86,2,And what will make you to know what At-Tariq is
  86,3,"The star, Ath-Thaqib"
  86,4,There is no human being but has a protector over him
  86,5,"So, let man see from what he is created"
  86,6,He is created from a water gushing forth
  86,7,Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs
  86,8,"Verily, He is Able to bring him back"
  86,9,The Day when all the secrets will be examined
  86,10,"Then he will have no power, nor any helper"
  86,11,"By the sky which gives rain, again and again"
  86,12,And the earth which splits
  86,13,"Verily, this is the Word that separates"
  86,14,And it is not a thing for amusement
  86,15,"Verily, they are but plotting a plot"
  86,16,And I am planning a plan
  86,17,"So, give a respite to the disbelievers; deal gently with them for a while"
  87,1,"Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High"
  87,2,"Who has created, and then proportioned it"
  87,3,And Who has measured; and then guided
  87,4,And Who brings out the pasturage
  87,5,And then makes it dark stubble
  87,6,"We shall make you recite, so you shall not forget"
  87,7,Except what Allah may will He knows what is apparent and what is hidden
  87,8,And We shall make easy for you the easy
  87,9,Therefore remind in case the reminder profits
  87,10,The reminder will be received by him who fears
  87,11,But it will be avoided by the wretched
  87,12,Who will enter the great Fire
  87,13,There he will neither die nor live
  87,14,Indeed whosoever purifies himself shall achieve success
  87,15,"And remembers the Name of his Lord, and performs Salah"
