  28,22,"And when he went towards Madyan, he said: \"It may be that my Lord guides me to the right way"
  28,23,"And when he arrived at the water of Madyan, he found there a group of men watering, and besides them he found two women who were keeping back (their flocks). He said: \"What is the matter with you\" They said: \"We cannot water (our flocks) until the shepherds take (their flocks). And our father is a very old man"
  28,24,"So he watered (their flocks) for them, then he turned back to shade, and said: \"My Lord! Truly, I am in need of whatever good that You bestow on me"
  28,25,"Then there came to him one of them, walking shyly. She said: \"Verily, my father calls you that he may reward you for having watered (our flocks) for us.\" So when he came to him and narrated the story, he said: \"Fear you not. You have escaped from the people who are wrongdoers"
  28,26,"And said one of them (the two women): \"O my father! Hire him! Verily, the best of men for you to hire is the strong, the trustworthy"
  28,27,"He said: \"I intend to wed one of these two daughters of mine to you, on condition that you serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten years, it will be (a favor) from you. But I intend not to place you under a difficulty. If Allah wills, you will find me one of the righteous"
  28,28,"He (Musa) said: \"That (is settled) between me and you: whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there will be no injustice to me, and Allah is Surety over what we say"
