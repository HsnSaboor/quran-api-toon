quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,7,"Verily, those who hope not for their meeting with Us, but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present world, and those who are heedless of Our Ayat"
  10,8,"Those, their abode will be the Fire, because of what they used to earn"
  10,9,"Verily, those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, their Lord will guide them through their faith; under them will flow rivers in the Gardens of delight (Paradise)"
  10,10,"Their way of request therein will be: \"Glory to You, O Allah!\" and \"Salam\" (peace, safety from evil) will be their greetings therein! And the close of their request will be: \"All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of all that exists"
  10,11,"And were Allah to hasten for mankind the evil as He hastens for them the good then they would have been ruined. So We leave those who expect not their meeting with Us, in their trespasses, wandering blindly in distraction"
  10,12,"And when harm touches man, he invokes Us, lying on his side, or sitting or standing. But when We have removed his harm from him, he passes on as if he had never invoked Us for a harm that touched him! Thus it is made fair seeming to the wasteful that which they used to do"
  10,13,"And indeed, We destroyed generations before you when they did wrong, while their Messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they were not such as to believe! Thus do We requite the people who are criminals"
  10,14,"Then We made you successors after them, generations after generations in the land, that We might see how you would work"
