quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,1,"They ask you about Al-Anfal (the spoils of war). Say: \"Al-Anfal are for Allah and the Messenger.\" So have Taqwa of Allah and settle all matters of difference among you, and obey Allah and His Messenger, if you are believers"
  8,2,"The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and when His Ayat are recited unto them, they increase their faith; and they put their trust in their Lord"
  8,3,Who perform the Salah and spend out of what We have provided them
  8,4,"It is they who are the believers in truth. For them are grades of dignity with their Lord, and forgiveness and a generous provision (Paradise)"
  8,5,"As your Lord caused you to go out from your home with the truth; and verily, a party among the believers disliked it"
  8,6,"Disputing with you concerning the truth after it was made manifest, as if they were being driven to death, while they were looking (at it)"
  8,7,"And (remember) when Allah promised you (Muslims) one of the two parties, that it should be yours; you wished that the one not armed should be yours, but Allah willed to justify the truth by His Words and to cut off the roots of the disbelievers"
  8,8,"That He might cause the truth to triumph and bring falsehood to nothing, even though the criminals hate it"
