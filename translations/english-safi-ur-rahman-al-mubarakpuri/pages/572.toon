  72,2,"It guides to the right path, and we have believed therein, and we shall never join anything with our Lord"
  72,3,"And He, exalted be the Jadd of our Lord, has taken neither a wife nor a son"

  72,6,"And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the Jinn, but they increased them in Rahaq"
  72,7,"And they thought as you thought, that Allah will not send any Messenger"
  72,8,And we have sought to reach the heaven; but we found it filled with stern guards and flaming fires
  72,9,"And verily, we used to sit there in stations, to (steal) a hearing, but any who listens now will find a flaming fire watching him in ambush"
  72,10,"And we know not whether evil is intended for those on the earth, or whether their Lord intends for them guidance"
  72,11,"There are among us some that are righteous, and some the contrary; we are groups having different ways"
  72,12,"And we think that we cannot escape Allah in the earth, nor can we escape Him by flight"
  72,13,"And indeed when we heard the Guidance, we believed therein, and whosoever believes in his Lord shall have no fear, either of a decrease in the reward of his good deeds or an increase in the punishment for his sins"
