  15,1,Alif-Lam-Ra. These are Ayat of the Book and a plain Qur'an
  15,2,How much would those who disbelieved wish that they had been Muslims
  15,3,"Leave them to eat and enjoy, and let them be preoccupied with (false) hope. They will come to know"
  15,4,And never did We destroy a township but there was a known decree for it
  15,5,"No nation can advance its term, nor delay it"
  15,6,"And they say: \"O you (Muhammad) to whom the Dhikr (the Qur'an) has been revealed! Verily, you are a madman"
  15,7,Why do you not bring angels to us if you are of the truthful
  15,8,"We do not send the angels down except with the truth, and in that case, they (the disbelievers) would have no respite"
  15,9,"Verily, We, it is We Who revealed the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur'an) and surely We will guard it (from corruption)"
  15,10,"Indeed, We sent (Messengers) before you (O Muhammad) amongst the earlier communities"

  15,15,"They would surely say (in the evening): \"Our eyes have been (as if) dazzled (we have not seen any angel or heaven). Nay, we are a people bewitched"
