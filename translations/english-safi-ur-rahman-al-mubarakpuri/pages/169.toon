quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,150,"And when Musa returned to his people, angry and grieved, he said: \"What an evil thing is that which you have done during my absence. Did you hasten in matter of your Lord\" And he threw down the Tablets and seized his brother by (the hair of) his head and dragged him towards him. He (Harun) said: \"O son of my mother! Indeed the people judged me weak and were about to kill me, so make not the enemies rejoice over me, nor put me among the people who are wrongdoers"
  7,151,"He (Musa) said: \"O my Lord! Forgive me and my brother, and admit us into Your mercy, for You are the Most Merciful of those who show mercy"
  7,152,"Certainly, those who took the calf (for worship), wrath from their Lord and humiliation will come upon them in the life of this world. Thus do We recompense those who invent lies"
  7,153,"But those who committed evil deeds and then repented afterwards and believed, verily, your Lord after (all) that is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  7,154,"And when the anger of Musa calmed, he took up the Tablets; and in their inscription was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord"
  7,155,"And Musa chose out of his people seventy (of the best) men for Our appointed time and place of meeting, and when they were seized with a violent earthquake, he said: \"O my Lord, if it had been Your Will, You could have destroyed them and me before; would You destroy us for the deeds of the foolish among us It is only Your trial by which You lead astray whom You will, and keep guided whom You will. You are our protector, so forgive us and have mercy on us: for You are the best of those who forgive"
