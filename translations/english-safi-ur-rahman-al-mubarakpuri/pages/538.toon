quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  57,4,"He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and then rose (Istawa) over the Throne. He knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it, and what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you wheresoever you may be. And Allah is the All-Seer of what you do"
  57,5,His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And to Allah return all the matters
  57,6,"He merges night into day, and merges day into night, and He has full knowledge of whatsoever is in the breasts"
  57,7,"Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and spend of that whereof He has made you trustees. And such of you as believe and spend, theirs will be a great reward"
  57,8,"And what is the matter with you that you believe not in Allah! While the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord; and He has indeed taken your covenant, if you are real believers"
  57,9,"It is He Who sends down manifest Ayat to His servant that He may bring you out from darkness into light. And verily, Allah is to you full of kindness, Most Merciful"
  57,10,And what is the matter with you that you spend not in the cause of Allah And to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth. Not equal among you are those who spent and fought before the conquering. Such are higher in degree than those who spent and fought afterwards. But to all Allah has promised the best. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do
  57,11,"Who is he that will lend Allah a handsome loan: then He will increase it manifold to his credit, and he will have a honorable reward"
