quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,195,"So their Lord accepted of them (their supplication and answered them), \"Never will I allow to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female. You are (members) one of another, so those who emigrated and were driven out from their homes, and suffered harm in My cause, and who fought and were killed (in My cause), verily, I will expiate from them their evil deeds and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise); a reward from Allah, and with Allah is the best of rewards"
  3,196,Let not the free disposal (and affluence) of the disbelievers throughout the land deceive you
  3,197,A brief enjoyment; then their ultimate abode is Hell; and worst indeed is that place for rest
  3,198,"But, for those who have Taqwa of their Lord, are Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise); therein are they to dwell, an entertainment from Allah; and that which is with Allah is the best for Al-Abrar (the most righteous)"
  3,199,"And there are, certainly, among the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), those who believe in Allah and in that which has been revealed to you, and in that which has been revealed to them, humbling themselves before Allah. They do not sell the verses of Allah for a small price, for them is a reward with their Lord. Surely, Allah is swift in account"
  3,200,"O you who believe! Endure and be more patient, and Rabitu, and have Taqwa of Allah, so that you may be successful"
