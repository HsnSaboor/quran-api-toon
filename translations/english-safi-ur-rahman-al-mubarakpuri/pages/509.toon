quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"Those who believe say: \"Why is not a Surah sent down (for us)\" But now that a decisive Surah is sent down mentioning fighting, you can see those in whose hearts is disease (of hypocrisy) looking at you with the look of one who is about to faint for fear of death. But it was better for them"
  47,21,"Obedience and good words. And when the matter is resolved, then if they had been true to Allah, it would have been better for them"
  47,22,"So would you perhaps, if you turned away, spread corruption on earth, and sever your ties of kinship"
  47,23,"Such are the ones whom Allah has cursed, so that He has made them deaf and blinded their vision"
  47,24,"Will they not then reflect upon the Qur'an, or are there locks upon their hearts"
  47,25,"Verily, those who have turned back as disbelievers after guidance had become clear to them -- Shaytan has enticed them and filled them with false hopes"
  47,26,"That is because they said to those who hate what Allah has sent down: \"We will obey you in part of the matter.\" And Allah knows their secrets"
  47,27,"Then how (will it be) when the angels will take their souls at death, striking their faces and their backs"
  47,28,"That is because they followed that which angered Allah and hated what earns His pleasure, so He rendered their deeds worthless"
  47,29,"Or do those in whose hearts is a disease, think that Allah will not expose their ill--wills"
