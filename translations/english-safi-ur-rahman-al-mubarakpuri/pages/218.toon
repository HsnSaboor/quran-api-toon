  10,79,"And Fir`awn said: \"Bring me every well-versed sorcerer"
  10,80,"And when the sorcerers came, Musa said to them: \"Cast down what you want to cast"
  10,81,"Then when they had cast down, Musa said: \"What you have brought is sorcery, Allah will surely make it of no effect. Verily, Allah does not set right the work of the evildoers"
  10,82,"And Allah will establish and make apparent the truth by His Words, however much the criminals may hate (it)"
  10,83,"But none believed in Musa except the offspring of his people, because of the fear of Fir`awn and his chiefs, lest they should persecute them; and verily, Fir`awn was an arrogant tyrant on the earth, he was indeed one of the transgressors"
  10,84,"And Musa said: \"O my people! If you have believed in Allah, then put your trust in Him if you are Muslims"
  10,85,"They said: \"In Allah we put our trust. Our Lord! Make us not a trial for the folk who are wrongdoers"

  10,87,"And We revealed to Musa and his brother (saying): \"Provide dwellings for your people in Egypt, and make your dwellings as places for your worship, and perform the Salah, and give glad tidings to the believers"
  10,88,"And Musa said: \"Our Lord! You have indeed bestowed on Fir`awn and his chiefs splendor and wealth in the life of this world, our Lord! That they may lead men astray from Your path. Our Lord! Destroy their wealth, and harden their hearts, so that they will not believe until they see the painful torment"
