quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,111,"And even if We had sent down unto them angels, and the dead had spoken unto them, and We had gathered together all things before them, they would not have believed, unless Allah willed, but most of them behave ignorantly"
  6,112,"And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies -- Shayatin among mankind and Jinn, inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion. If your Lord had so willed, they would not have done it; so leave them alone with their fabrications"
  6,113,"And Tasgha to it that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to such (deceit), and that they may remain pleased with it, and that they may commit what they are committing"
  6,114,"[Say:] \"Shall I seek a judge other than Allah while it is He Who has sent down unto you the Book, explained in detail.\" Those unto whom We gave the Scripture know that it is revealed from your Lord in truth. So be not you of those who doubt"
  6,115,"And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can change His Words. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower"
  6,116,"And if you obey most of those on the earth, they will mislead you far away from Allah's path. They follow nothing but conjecture, and they do nothing but lie"
  6,117,"Verily, your Lord! It is He Who knows best who strays from His way, and He knows best the rightly guided"
  6,118,"So eat of that on which Allah's Name has been mentioned, if you are believers in His Ayat"
