quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star when it goes down
  53,2,Your companion has neither gone astray nor has he erred
  53,3,Nor does he speak of desire
  53,4,It is only a revelation revealed
  53,5,He has been taught by one mighty in power
  53,6,Dhu Mirrah then he Istawa
  53,7,While he was in the highest part of the horizon
  53,8,Then he approached and came closer
  53,9,And was at a distance of two bows' length or less
  53,10,So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed

  53,20,"And Manat, the other third"
  53,21,Is it for you the males and for Him the females

  53,23,"They are but names which you have named - you and your fathers - for which Allah has sent down no authority. They follow but a guess and that which they themselves desire, whereas there has surely come to them the guidance from their Lord"
  53,24,Or shall man have what he wishes
  53,25,But to Allah belongs the last (Hereafter) and the first (the world)
  53,26,"And there are many angels in the heavens, whose intercession will avail nothing, except after Allah has given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with"
