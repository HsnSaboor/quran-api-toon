quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our Ayat and said: \"I shall certainly be given wealth and children [if I live again]"
  19,78,Has he known the Unseen or has he taken a covenant from the Most Gracious
  19,79,"Nay, We shall record what he says, and We shall increase his torment"
  19,80,"And We shall inherit from him all that he speaks of, and he shall come to Us alone"
  19,81,"And they have taken gods besides Allah, that they might give them honor, power and glory"
  19,82,"Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and will become their adversaries"
  19,83,See you not that We have sent the Shayatin against the disbelievers to push them to do evil
  19,84,So make no haste against them; We only count out to them a (limited) number
  19,85,"The Day We shall gather those with Taqwa unto the Most Gracious (Allah), like a delegation"
  19,86,"And We shall drive the criminals to Hell, in a thirsty state"
  19,87,"None shall have the power of intercession, but such a one as has received permission (or promise) from the Most Gracious (Allah)"
  19,88,"And they say: \"The Most Gracious (Allah) has begotten a son"
  19,89,Indeed you have brought forth (said) a thing Idda
  19,90,"Whereby the heavens are almost torn, and the earth is split asunder, and the mountains Hadda"
  19,91,That they ascribe a son to the Most Gracious
  19,92,But it is not suitable for the Most Gracious that He should beget a son
  19,93,There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious as a slave
  19,94,"Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting"
  19,95,And everyone of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection
