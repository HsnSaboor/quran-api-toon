quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and Duhaha
  91,2,By the moon as it Talaha
  91,3,By the day as it Jallaha
  91,4,By the night as it Yaghshaha
  91,5,By the heaven and Ma Banaha
  91,6,By the earth and Ma Tahhaha
  91,7,"By Nafs, and Ma Sawwaha (Who apportioned it)"
  91,8,Then He showed it its Fujur and its Taqwa
  91,9,Indeed he succeeds who purifies it
  91,10,And indeed he fails who Dassaha
  91,11,Thamud denied through their trans- gression
  91,12,When their most wicked went forth
  91,13,"But the Messenger of Allah said to them: \"Be cautious! That is the she-camel of Allah! (Do not harm it) and (bar it not from having) its drink"
  91,14,"Then they denied him and they killed it. So their Lord destroyed them because of their sin, Fasawwaha"
  91,15,And He feared not the consequences thereof
  92,1,By the night as it envelops
  92,2,By the day as it appears
  92,3,By Him Who created male and female
  92,4,"Certainly, your efforts and deeds are diverse"
  92,5,As for him who gives and has Taqwa
  92,6,And believes in Al-Husna
  92,7,We will make smooth for him the path of ease
  92,8,But he who is greedy and thinks himself self-sufficient
  92,9,And denies Al-Husna
  92,10,We will make smooth for him the path to evil
  92,11,And what will his wealth avail him when he goes down (in destruction)
  92,12,"Truly, on Us is (to give) guidance"
  92,13,"And truly, unto Us (belong) the last (Hereafter) and the first (this world)"
  92,14,Therefore I have warned you of a Fire Talazza
