quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"Who used to say: `Are you among those who believe"
  37,53,"(That) when we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed be indebted (Madinun)"
  37,54,"(The speaker) said: \"Will you look down"
  37,55,So he looked down and saw him in the midst of the Fire
  37,56,"He said: \"By Allah! You have nearly ruined me"
  37,57,"Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought forth (to Hell)"
  37,58,Are we then not to die (any more)
  37,59,"Except our first death, and we shall not be punished"
  37,60,"Truly, this is the supreme success"
  37,61,For the like of this let the workers work
  37,62,Is that (Paradise) better entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum
  37,63,"Truly, We have made it (as) a trial for the wrongdoers"
  37,64,"Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-fire"
  37,65,The shoots of its fruit stalks are like the heads of Shayatin
  37,66,"Truly, they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith"
  37,67,Then on the top of that they will be given boiling Hamim
  37,68,"Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell"
  37,69,"Verily, they found their fathers on the wrong path"
  37,70,So they (too) hastened in their footsteps
  37,71,And indeed most of the earlier ones went astray before them
  37,72,And indeed We sent among them warners
  37,73,Then see what was the end of those who were warned
  37,74,Except the chosen servants of Allah
  37,75,"And indeed Nuh invoked Us, and We are the best of those who answer"
  37,76,And We rescued him and his family from the great distress
