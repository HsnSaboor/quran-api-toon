quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,"And that He creates the pairs, male and female"
  53,46,From Nutfah when it is emitted
  53,47,And that upon Him is another bringing forth (Resurrection)
  53,48,And that it is He Who Aghna and Aqna
  53,49,And that He is the Lord of Ash-Shi`ra
  53,50,And that it is He Who destroyed the former `Ad
  53,51,And Thamud. He spared none of them
  53,52,"And the people of Nuh aforetime. Verily, they were more unjust and more rebellious and transgressing"
  53,53,And He destroyed the overthrown cities
  53,54,"So, there covered them that which did cover"
  53,55,Then which of the graces of your Lord will you doubt
  53,56,This is a warner from the warners of old
  53,57,The Azifah draws near
  53,58,None besides Allah can avert it
  53,59,Do you then wonder at this reci- tation
  53,60,And you laugh at it and weep not
  53,61,While you are Samidun
  53,62,So fall you down in prostration to Allah and worship Him
  54,1,"The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder"
  54,2,"And if they see an Ayah, they turn away and say: \"This is magic, Mustamir"
  54,3,They denied and followed their own lusts. And every matter will be settled
  54,4,And indeed there has come to them news wherein there is Muzdajar
  54,5,"Perfect wisdom, but warners benefit them not"
  54,6,So withdraw from them. The Day that the caller will call (them) to a terrible thing
