quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,None shall enter it save the most wretched
  92,16,Who denies and turns away
  92,17,And those with Taqwa will be far removed from it
  92,18,He who gives of his wealth for self-purification
  92,19,And who has (in mind) no favor from anyone to be paid back
  92,20,"Except to seek the Face of his Lord, the Most High"
  92,21,"He, surely, will be pleased"
  93,1,By the forenoon
  93,2,By the night when it darkens
  93,3,Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hates you
  93,4,And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present
  93,5,"And verily, your Lord will give you so that you shall be well-pleased"
  93,6,Did He not find you an orphan and gave you a refuge
  93,7,And He found you unaware and guided you
  93,8,And He found you poor and made you rich
  93,9,"Therefore, treat not the orphan with oppression"
  93,10,And repulse not the one who asks
  93,11,And proclaim the grace of your Lord
  94,1,Have We not opened your breast for you
  94,2,And removed from you your burden
  94,3,Which weighed down your back
  94,4,And have We not raised high your fame
  94,5,"Verily, along with every hardship is relief"
  94,6,"Verily, along with every hardship is relief"
  94,7,"So when you have finished, devote yourself to Allah's worship"
  94,8,And to your Lord turn intentions and hopes
