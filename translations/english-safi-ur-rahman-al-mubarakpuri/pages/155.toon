quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,38,"(Allah) will say: \"Enter you in the company of nations who passed away before you, of men and Jinn, into the Fire.\" Every time a new nation enters, it curses its sister nation (that went before) until they are all together in the Fire. The last of them will say to the first of them: \"Our Lord! These misled us, so give them a double torment of the Fire.\" He will say: \"For each one there is double (torment), but you know not"
  7,39,"The first of them will say to the last of them: \"You were not better than us, so taste the torment for what you used to earn"
  7,40,"Verily, those who belie Our Ayat and treat them with arrogance, for them the gates of the heavens will not be opened, and they will not enter Paradise until the Jamal goes through the eye of the needle. Thus do We recompense the criminals"
  7,41,"Theirs will be Mihad from the Fire, and over them Ghawash. Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers"
  7,42,"But those who believed, and worked righteousness -- We burden not any person beyond his scope -- such are the dwellers of Paradise. They will abide therein"
  7,43,"And We shall remove from their breasts any Ghill; rivers flowing under them, and they will say: \"All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has guided us to this, and never could we have found guidance, were it not that Allah had guided us! Indeed, the Messengers of our Lord did come with the truth.\" And it will be cried out to them: \"This is the Paradise which you have inherited for what you used to do"
