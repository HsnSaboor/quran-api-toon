  20,52,"[Musa] said: \"The knowledge thereof is with my Lord, in a Record. My Lord neither errs nor forgets"
  20,53,"Who has made earth for you like a bed; and has opened ways for you therein, and has sent down water (rain) from the sky. And We have brought forth with it various kinds of vegetation"
  20,54,"Eat and pasture your cattle; verily, in this are Ayat for men of understanding"
  20,55,"Thereof We created you, and into it We shall return you, and from it We shall bring you out once again"

  20,57,"He (Fir`awn) said: \"Have you come to drive us out of our land with your magic, O Musa"
