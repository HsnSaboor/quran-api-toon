quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  18,46,"Wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world. But the good righteous deeds that last, are better with your Lord for reward and better for hope"
  18,47,"And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away, and you will see the earth as a levelled plain, and We shall gather them so that We will leave not one of them behind"
  18,48,"And they will be set before your Lord, aligned. (He will say:) \"Now indeed, you have come to Us as We created you the first time. Nay, but you thought that We had appointed no meeting for you (with Us)"
  18,49,"And the Book will be produced, and you will see the criminals, fearful of that which is therein. They will say: \"Woe to us! What sort of Book is this that leaves neither a small thing nor a large thing, but has recorded it with numbers!\" And they will find all that they did, present, and your Lord treats no one with injustice"
  18,50,"And (remember) when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves unto Adam.\" So they prostrated themselves, except Iblis. He was one of the Jinn; he disobeyed the command of his Lord.
