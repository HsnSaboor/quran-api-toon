quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,30,"On the Day when every person will be confronted with the good he has done, and all the evil he has done, he will wish that there were a great distance between him and his evil. And Allah warns you against Himself and Allah is full of kindness with the servants"
  3,31,"Say (O Muhammad to mankind): \"If you (really) love Allah, then follow me (i.e. Muhammad), Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  3,32,"Say: \"Obey Allah and the Messenger.\" But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers"
  3,33,"Allah chose Adam, Nuh (Noah), the family of Ibrahim and the family of `Imran above the nations"
  3,34,"Offspring, one of the other, and Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower"
  3,35,"(Remember) when the wife of `Imran said: \"O my Lord! I have vowed to You what is in my womb to be dedicated for Your services, so accept this from me. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knowing"
  3,36,"Then when she gave birth to her, she said: \"O my Lord! I have given birth to a female child, ـ and Allah knew better what she bore, ـ \"And the male is not like the female, and I have named her Maryam, and I seek refuge with You for her and for her offspring from Shaytan, the outcast"
  3,37,"So her Lord (Allah) accepted her with goodly acceptance. He made her grow in a good manner and put her under the care of Zakariyya. Every time he entered the Mihrab to (visit) her, he found her supplied with sustenance. He said: \"O Maryam! From where have you gotten this\" She said, \"This is from Allah.\" Verily, Allah provides sustenance to whom He wills, without limit"
