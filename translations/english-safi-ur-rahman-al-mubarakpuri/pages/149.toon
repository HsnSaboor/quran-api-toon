quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,152,"And come not near to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until he (or she) attains the age of full strength; and give full measure and full weight with justice.\" -- We burden not any person, but that which he can bear -- \"And whenever you speak, say the truth even if a near relative is concerned, and fulfill the covenant of Allah. This He commands you, that you may remember"
  6,153,"And verily, this is My straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may have Taqwa"
  6,154,"Then, We gave Musa the Book [the Tawrah], complete for that which is best, and explaining all things in detail and a guidance and a mercy that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord"
  6,155,"And this is a blessed Book (the Qur'an) which We have sent down, so follow it and have Taqwa, so that you may receive mercy"
  6,156,"Lest you should say: \"The Book was sent down only to two sects before us, and for our part, we were in fact unaware of what they studied"
  6,157,"Or lest you should say: \"If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely have been better guided than they.\" So now has come unto you a clear proof from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy. Who then does more wrong than one who rejects the Ayat of Allah and Sadafa away therefrom We shall requite those who turn away from Our Ayat with an evil torment, because of their turning away"
