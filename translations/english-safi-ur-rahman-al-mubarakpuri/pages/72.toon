quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,166,"And what you suffered on the day the two armies met, was by the leave of Allah, in order that He might test the believers"
  3,167,"And that He might test the hypocrites, it was said to them: \"Come, fight in the way of Allah or defend yourselves.\" They said: \"Had we known that fighting will take place, we would certainly have followed you.\" They were that day, nearer to disbelief than to faith, saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts. And Allah has full knowledge of what they conceal"
  3,168,"(They are) the ones who said about their killed brethren while they themselves sat (at home): \"If only they had listened to us, they would not have been killed.\" Say: \"Avert death from your own selves, if you speak the truth"
  3,169,"Think not of those as dead who are killed in the way of Allah. Nay, they are alive, with their Lord, and they have provision"
  3,170,"They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them of His bounty and rejoice for the sake of those who have not yet joined them, but are left behind (not yet martyred) that on them no fear shall come, nor shall they grieve"
  3,171,"They rejoice in a grace and a bounty from Allah, and that Allah will not waste the reward of the believers"
  3,172,"Those who answered (the Call of) Allah and the Messenger after being wounded; for those of them who did good deeds and feared Allah, there is a great reward"
  3,173,"Those to whom the people said, \"Verily, the people have gathered against you, therefore, fear them.\" But it (only) increased them in faith, and they said: \"Allah is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs"
