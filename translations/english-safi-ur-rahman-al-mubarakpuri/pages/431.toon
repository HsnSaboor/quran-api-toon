quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,23,"Intercession with Him profits not except for him whom He permits. So much so that when fear is banished from their hearts, they say: \"What is it that your Lord has said\" They say the truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great"
  34,24,"Say: \"Who gives you provision from the heavens and the earth\" Say: \"Allah. And verily, (either) we or you are rightly guided or in plain error"
  34,25,"Say: \"You will not be asked about our sins, nor shall we be asked of what you do"
  34,26,"Say: \"Our Lord will assemble us all together, then He will judge between us with truth. And He is the Just Judge, the All-Knower of the true state of affairs"
  34,27,"Say: \"Show me those whom you have joined with Him as partners. Nay! But He is Allah, the Almighty, the All-Wise"
  34,28,"And We have not sent you except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind, and most of men know not"
  34,29,"And they say: \"When is this promise if you are truthful"
  34,30,"Say: \"The appointment to you is for a Day, which you cannot put back for an hour nor put forward"
  34,31,"And those who disbelieve say: \"We believe not in this Qur'an nor in that which was before it.\" But if you could see when the wrongdoers are made to stand before their Lord, how they will cast the (blaming) word one to another! Those who were deemed weak will say to those who were arrogant: \"Had it not been for you, we should certainly have been believers"
