quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  18,84,"Verily, We established him in the earth, and We gave him the means of everything"
  18,85,So he followed a way
  18,86,"Until, when he reached the setting place of the sun, he found it setting in a spring of Hami'ah. And he found near it a people. We said: \"O Dhul-Qarnayn! Either you punish them or treat them with kindness"
  18,87,"He said: \"As for him who does wrong, we shall punish him, and then he will be brought back unto his Lord, Who will punish him with a terrible torment (Hell)"
  18,88,"But as for him who believes and works righteousness, he shall have the best reward, and we shall speak unto him mild words"
  18,89,Then he followed (another) way
  18,90,"Until, when he came to the rising place of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We (Allah) had provided no shelter against the sun"
  18,91,So (it was)! And We knew all about him (Dhul-Qarnayn)
  18,92,Then he followed (another) way
  18,93,"Until, when he reached between two mountains, he found before them a people who scarcely understood a word"
  18,94,"They said: \"O Dhul-Qarnayn! Verily, Ya'juj and Ma'juj are doing great mischief in the land. Shall we then pay you a tribute in order that you might erect a barrier between us and them"
  18,95,"He said: \"That in which my Lord had established me is better. So help me with strength, I will erect between you and them a barrier"
  18,96,"Give me Zubar of iron;\" then, when he had filled up the gap between the two mountain-cliffs, he said: \"Blow;\" then when he had made them (red as) fire, he said: \"Bring me Qitran to pour over them"
  18,97,So they could not scale it or dig through it
