  66,3,"And (remember) when the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his wives, then she told it. And Allah made it known to him; he informed part thereof and left a part. Then when he told her thereof, she said: \"Who told you this\" He said: \"The All-Knower, the All-Aware has told me"
  66,4,"If you two turn in repentance to Allah, your hearts are indeed so inclined; but if you help one another against him, then verily, Allah is his Protector, and Jibril, and the righteous among the believers; and after that the angels are his helpers"

  66,6,"O you who believe! Protect yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not the commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded"
  66,7,(It will be said in the Hereafter) O you who disbelieve! Make no excuses this Day! You are being requited only for what you used to do
