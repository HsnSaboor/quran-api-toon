quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,80,Whether you (O Muhammad) ask forgiveness for them (hypocrites) or ask not forgiveness for them -- (and even) if you ask seventy times for their forgiveness -- Allah will not forgive them because they have disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger. And Allah guides not those people who are rebellious
  9,81,"Those who stayed away (from Tabuk expedition) rejoiced in their staying behind the Messenger of Allah; they hated to strive and fight with their properties and their lives in the cause of Allah, and they said: \"March not forth in the heat.\" Say: \"The fire of Hell is more intense in heat;\" if only they could understand"
  9,82,So let them laugh a little and (they will) cry much as a recompense of what they used to earn (by committing sins)
  9,83,"If Allah brings you back to a party of them (the hypocrites), and they ask your permission to go out (to fight), say: \"Never shall you go out with me nor fight an enemy with me; you were pleased to sit (inactive) on the first occasion, then you sit (now) with those who lag behind"
  9,84,"And never (O Muhammad) pray (funeral prayer) for any of them (hypocrites) who dies, nor stand at his grave. Certainly they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and died while they were Fasiqun"
  9,85,"And let not their wealth or their children amaze you. Allah only wants to punish them with these things in this world, and that their souls shall depart (die) while they are disbelievers.) We mentioned before the explanation of a similar Ayah, all the thanks and praises are due to Allah"
  9,86,"And when a Surah is revealed, enjoining them to believe in Allah and to strive hard and fight along with His Messenger, the wealthy among them ask your leave to exempt them and say, \"Leave us (behind), we would be with those who sit (at home)"
