quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,Successful indeed are the believers
  23,2,Those who with their Salah are Khashi`un
  23,3,And those who turn away from Al-Laghw
  23,4,And those who pay the Zakah
  23,5,And those who guard their private parts
  23,6,"Except from their wives or their right hand possessions, for then, they are free from blame"
  23,7,"But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors"
  23,8,Those who are faithfully true to their Amanat and to their covenants are Ra`un
  23,9,And those who strictly guard their Salawat
  23,10,These are indeed the heirs
  23,11,Who shall inherit Firdaws. They shall dwell therein forever
  23,12,And indeed We created man out of an extract of Tin
  23,13,Thereafter We made him a Nutfah in a safe lodging
  23,14,"Then We made the Nutfah into a clot, then We made the clot into a little lump of flesh, then We made out of that little lump of flesh bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, and then We brought it forth as another creation. So Blessed is Allah, the Best of creators"
  23,15,"After that, surely you will die"
  23,16,"Then (again), surely you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection"
  23,17,"And indeed We have created above you seven Tara'iq, and We are never unaware of the creation"
