quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,45,"So the roots of the people who did wrong were cut off. And all the praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the all that exists"
  6,46,"Say: \"Tell me, if Allah took away your hearing and your sight, and sealed up your hearts, is there a god other than Allah who could restore them to you\" See how variously We explain the Ayat, yet they turn aside"
  6,47,"Say: \"Tell me, if the punishment of Allah comes to you suddenly, or openly, will any be destroyed except the wrongdoing people"
  6,48,"And We send not the Messengers but as givers of glad tidings and as warners. So whosoever believes and does righteous good deeds, upon such shall come no fear, nor shall they grieve"
  6,49,"But those who reject Our Ayat, the torment will strike them for their rebelling"
  6,50,"Say: \"I don't tell you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor (that) I know the Unseen; nor do I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me.\" Say: \"Are the blind and the one who sees equal Will you not then consider"
  6,51,"And warn therewith those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord, when there will be neither a protector nor an intercessor for them besides Him, so that they may have Taqwa"
  6,52,"And turn not away those who invoke their Lord, morning and evening seeking His Face. You are accountable for them in nothing, and they are accountable for you in nothing, that you may turn them away, and thus become of the wrongdoers"
