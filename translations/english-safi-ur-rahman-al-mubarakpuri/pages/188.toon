  9,7,"How can there be a covenant with Allah and with His Messenger for the Mushrikin except those with whom you made a covenant near Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah) So long as they are true to you, stand you true to them. Verily, Allah loves those who have Taqwa"
  9,8,"How When if you are overpowered by them, they regard not the ties, either of kinship, (Ill) or of covenant (Dhimmah) With their mouths they please you, but their hearts are averse to you, and most of them are rebellious"
  9,9,"They have purchased with the Ayat of Allah a little gain, and they hindered men from His way; evil indeed is that which they used to do"
