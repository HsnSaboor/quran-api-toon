  14,13,"And those who disbelieved, said to their Messengers: \"Surely, we shall drive you out of our land, or you shall return to our religion.\" So their Lord revealed to them: \"Truly, We shall destroy the wrongdoers"
  14,14,"And indeed, We shall make you dwell in the land after them. This is for him who fears standing before Me and also fears My threat"
  14,15,"And they sought victory and help; and every obstinate, arrogant dictator (who refuses to believe in the Oneness of Allah) was brought to a complete loss and destruction"
  14,16,"In front of him is Hell, and he will be made to drink boiling, festering water"
