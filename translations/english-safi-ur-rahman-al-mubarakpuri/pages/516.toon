quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  49,5,"And if they had patience till you could come out to them, it would have been better for them. And Allah is Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  49,6,"O you who believe! If a rebellious evil person comes to you with a news, verify it, lest you harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful to what you have done"
  49,7,"And know that among you there is the Messenger of Allah. If he were to obey you in much of the matter, you would surely be in trouble, but Allah has endeared the faith to you and has beautified it in your hearts, and has made disbelief, Fusuq and `Isyan hateful to you. Such are they who are the rightly guided"
  49,8,"This is a grace from Allah and His favor. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  49,9,"And if two parties among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them both. But if one of them outrages against the other, then fight you (all) against the one that which outrages till it complies with the command of Allah. Then if it complies, then make reconciliation between them justly, and be equitable. Verily, Allah loves those who are the equitable"
  49,10,"The believers are but a brotherhood. So make reconciliation between your brothers, and have Taqwa of Allah that you may receive mercy"
  49,11,"O you who believe! Let not a group scoff at another group, it may be that the latter are better than the former. Nor let (some) women scoff at other women, it may be that the latter are better than the former. Nor defame yourselves, nor insult one another by nicknames. Evil is the name of wickedness after faith. And whosoever does not repent, then such are indeed wrongdoers"
