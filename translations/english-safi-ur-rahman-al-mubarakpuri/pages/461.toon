quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,"Is he whose breast Allah has opened to Islam, so that he is in light from his Lord So, woe to those whose hearts are hardened against remembrance of Allah! They are in plain error"
  39,23,"Allah has sent down the Best Statement, a Book, its parts resembling each other, (and) oft-repeated. The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver from it. Then their skin and their heart soften to the remembrance of Allah. That is the guidance of Allah. He guides therewith whom He wills; and whomever Allah sends astray, for him there is no guide"
  39,24,"Is he then, who will confront with his face the awful torment on the Day of Resurrection And it will be said to the wrongdoers: \"Taste what you used to earn"
  39,25,"Those before them denied, and so the torment came on them from directions they perceived not"
  39,26,"So, Allah made them to taste the disgrace in the present life, but greater is the torment of the Hereafter if they only knew"
  39,27,"And indeed We have put forth for men, in this Qur'an every kind of parable in order that they may remember"
  39,28,"An Arabic Qur'an, without any crookedness (therein) in order that they may have Taqwa of Him"
  39,29,"Allah puts forth a parable: a man belonging to many partners disputing with one another, and a man belonging entirely to one master. Are those two equal in comparison All the praises and thanks be to Allah! But most of them know not"
  39,30,"Verily, you will die, and verily, they (too) will die"
  39,31,"Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will be disputing before your Lord"
