quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  15,71,"[Lut] said: \"These are my daughters, if you must act (so)"
  15,72,"Verily, by your life, in their wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly"
  15,73,So the Sayhah overtook them at the time of sunrise
  15,74,And We turned them upside down and rained stones of baked clay upon them
  15,75,"Surely, in this are signs for those who see"
  15,76,"And verily, they were right on the highroad"
  15,77,"Surely, there is indeed a sign in that for the believers"
  15,78,"And the Dwellers of Al-Aykah, were also wrongdoers"
  15,79,"So, We took vengeance on them. They are both on an open route, plain to see"
  15,80,"And verily, the Dwellers of Al-Hijr denied the Messengers"
  15,81,"And We gave them Our signs, but they were averse to them"
  15,82,"And they used to hew out dwellings from the mountains, (feeling) secure"
  15,83,But the Sayhah (torment - awful cry) overtook them in the early morning
  15,84,And all that they used to earn availed them not
  15,85,"And We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with the truth, and the Hour is surely coming, so overlook their faults with gracious forgiveness"
  15,86,"Verily, your Lord is the Knowing Creator"
  15,87,"And indeed, We have bestowed upon you seven of the Mathani, and the Grand Qur'an"
  15,88,"Look not with your eyes ambitiously at what We have given to certain classes of them, nor grieve over them. And lower your wings to the believers"
  15,89,"And say (O Muhammad): \"I am indeed a plain warner"
  15,90,As We have sent down on the Muqtasimin (conspiring confederates)
