quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,All that with which they used to enjoy shall not avail them
  26,208,And never did We destroy a township but it had its warners
  26,209,"By way of reminder, and We have never been unjust"
  26,210,And it is not the Shayatin (devils) who have brought it down
  26,211,Neither would it suit them nor are they able
  26,212,"Verily, they have been removed far from hearing it"
  26,213,"So, invoke not with Allah another god lest you should be among those who receive punishment"
  26,214,And warn your tribe of near kindred
  26,215,And be kind and humble to the believers who follow you
  26,216,"Then if they disobey you, say: \"I am innocent of what you do"
  26,217,"And put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful"
  26,218,Who sees you when you stand up
  26,219,And your movements among those who fall prostrate
  26,220,"Verily, He, only He, is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower"
  26,221,Shall I inform you upon whom the Shayatin descend
  26,222,"They descend on every lying, sinful person (Athim)"
  26,223,"Who gives ear, and most of them are liars"
  26,224,"As for the poets, the astray follow them"
  26,225,See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry
  26,226,And that they say what they do not do
  26,227,"Except those who believe and do righteous deeds, and remember Allah much and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned"
