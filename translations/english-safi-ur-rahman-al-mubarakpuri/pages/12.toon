quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,77,Know they (Jews) not that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal
  2,78,"And there are among them (Jews) `Ummyyun (unlettered) people, who know not the Book, but they trust upon Amani (false desires) and they but guess"
  2,79,"Then woe to those who write the book with their own hands and then say, \"This is from Allah,\" to purchase with it a little price! Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for that they earn thereby"
  2,80,"And they (Jews) say, \"The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days.\" Say (O Muhammad to them): \"Have you taken a covenant from Allah, so that Allah will not break His covenant Or is it that you say of Allah what you know not"
  2,81,"Yes! Whosoever earns evil and his sin has surrounded him, they are dwellers of the Fire (i.e. Hell); they will dwell therein forever"
  2,82,"And those who believe and do righteous good deeds, they are dwellers of Paradise, they will dwell therein forever"
  2,83,"And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, (saying): Worship none but Allah (alone) and be dutiful and good to parents, and to kindred, and to orphans and (the poor), and speak good to people and perform As-Salah and give Zakah. Then you slid back, except a few of you, while you are backsliders"
