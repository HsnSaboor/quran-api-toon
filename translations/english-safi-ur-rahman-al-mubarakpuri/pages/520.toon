quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,And how many a generation We have destroyed before them who were stronger in power than they. And they went about the land! Could they find any place of refuge
  50,37,"Verily, therein is indeed a reminder for him who has a heart or gives ear while he is heedful"
  50,38,And indeed We created the heavens and the earth and all between them in six Days and nothing of fatigue touched Us
  50,39,"So bear with patience all that they say, and glorify the praises of your Lord, before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting"
  50,40,And during a part of the night (also) glorify His praises and (so likewise) after the prostrations
  50,41,And listen on the Day when the caller will call from a near place
  50,42,"The Day when they will hear As-Sayhah in truth, that will be the Day of coming out"
  50,43,"Verily, it is We Who give life and cause death; and to Us is the final return"
  50,44,"On the Day when the earth shall be cleft, from off them (they will come out) hastening forth. That will be a gathering, quite easy for Us"
  50,45,We know best what they say. And you are not the one to force them. But warn by the Qur'an; him who fears My threat
  51,1,By the scattering Dhariyat
  51,2,And the laden Hamilat
  51,3,And the steady Jariyat
  51,4,And the distributors of command
  51,5,"Verily, that which you are promised is surely true"
  51,6,"And verily, Ad-Din is sure to occur"
