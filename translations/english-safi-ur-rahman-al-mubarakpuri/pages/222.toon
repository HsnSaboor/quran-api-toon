quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,6,And no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit. All is in a Clear Book
  11,7,"And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was over the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds. But if you were to say to them: \"You shall indeed be raised up after death,\" those who disbelieve would be sure to say, \"This is nothing but obvious magic"
  11,8,"And if We delay the torment for them till a determined Ummah (term), they are sure to say, \"What keeps it back\" Verily, on the day it reaches them, nothing will turn it away from them, and they will be surrounded by (or fall in) that at which they used to mock"
  11,9,"And if We give man a taste of mercy from Us, and then withdraw it from him, verily, he is despairing, ungrateful"
  11,10,"But if We let him taste good (favor) after evil (poverty and harm) has touched him, he is sure to say: \"Ills have departed from me.\" Surely, he is exultant and boastful (ungrateful to Allah)"
  11,11,"Except those who show patience and do righteous good deeds: those, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward (Paradise)"
  11,12,"So perchance you may give up a part of what is revealed unto you, and that your breast feels straitened for it because they say, \"Why has not a treasure been sent down unto him, or an angel come with him\" But you are only a warner. And Allah is a Guardian over all things"
