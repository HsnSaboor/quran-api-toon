quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  62,9,"O you who believe! When the call is proclaimed for the Salah on Al-Jumu`ah (Friday), then hasten (Fas`aw) to the remembrance of Allah and leave off business. That is better for you if you did but know"
  62,10,"Then when the Salah is complete, you may disperse through the land, and seek the bounty of Allah, and remember Allah much, that you may be successful"
  62,11,"And when they see some merchandise or some amusement, they disperse headlong to it, and leave you standing. Say: \"That which Allah has is better than any amusement or merchandise! And Allah is the best of providers"
  63,1,"When the hypocrites come to you, they say: \"We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allah.\" Allah knows that you are indeed His Messenger, and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars indeed"
  63,2,"They have made their oaths a screen. Thus they hinder (others) from the path of Allah. Verily, evil is what they used to do"
  63,3,"That is because they believed, and then disbelieved; therefore their hearts are sealed, so they understand not"
  63,4,"And when you look at them, their bodies please you; and when they speak, you listen to their words. They are as blocks of wood propped up. They think that every cry is against them. They are the enemies, so beware of them. May Allah curse them! How are they denying the right path"
