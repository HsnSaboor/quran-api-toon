quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,216,"Fighting is ordained for you (Muslims) though you dislike it, and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know"
  2,217,"They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months. Say, \"Fighting therein is a great (transgression) but a greater (transgression) with Allah is to prevent mankind from following the way of Allah, to disbelieve in Him, to prevent access to Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah), and to drive out its inhabitants, and Al-Fitnah is worse than killing.\" And they will never cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion (Islamic Monotheism) if they can. And whosoever of you turns back from his religion and dies as a disbeliever, then his deeds will be lost in this life and in the Hereafter, and they will be the dwellers of the Fire. They will abide therein forever"
  2,218,"Verily, those who have believed, and those who have emigrated (for Allah's religion) and have striven hard in the way of Allah, all these hope for Allah's mercy. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Merciful"
  2,219,"They ask you (O Muhammad) concerning alcoholic drink and gambling. Say: \"In them is a great sin, and (some) benefits for men, but the sin of them is greater than their benefit.\" And they ask you what they ought to spend. Say: \"That which is (spare) beyond your needs.\" Thus Allah makes clear to you His Laws in order that you may give thought"
