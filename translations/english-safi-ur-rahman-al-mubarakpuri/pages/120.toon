quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,71,"They thought there will be no Fitnah (trial or punishment), so they became blind and deaf; after that Allah turned to them (with forgiveness); yet again many of them became blind and deaf. And Allah is the All-Seer of what they do"
  5,72,"Surely, they have disbelieved who say: \"Allah is the Messiah [`Isa], son of Maryam.\" But the Messiah said: \"O Children of Israel! worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.\" Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the wrongdoers there are no helpers"
  5,73,"Surely, they have disbelieved who say: \"Allah is the third of three.\" And there is no god but One God (Allah). And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them"
  5,74,"Will they not repent to Allah and ask His forgiveness For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  5,75,"The Messiah [`Isa], son of Maryam, was no more than a Messenger; many were the Messengers that passed away before him. His mother [Maryam] was a Siddiqah. They both used to eat food. Look how We make the Ayat clear to them; yet look how they are deluded away (from the truth)"
  5,76,"Say: \"How do you worship besides Allah something which has no power either to harm or to benefit you But it is Allah Who is the All-Hearer, All-Knower"
