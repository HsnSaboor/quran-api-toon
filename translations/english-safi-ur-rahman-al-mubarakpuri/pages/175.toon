quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"Say: \"I possess no power over benefit or harm to myself except as Allah wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghayb (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe"
  7,189,"It is He Who has created you from a single person, and (then) He has created from him his wife, in order that he might enjoy the pleasure of living with her. When he covered [had sexual relation with] her, she became pregnant and she carried it about (lightly). Then when it became heavy, they both invoked Allah, their Lord (saying): \"If You give us a Salih (good in every aspect) child, we shall indeed be among the grateful"
  7,190,"But when He gave them a Salih child, they ascribed partners to Him (Allah) in that which He has given to them. High be Allah, Exalted above all that they ascribe as partners to Him"
  7,191,Do they attribute as partners to Allah those who created nothing but they themselves are created
  7,192,"No help can they give them, nor can they help themselves"
  7,193,"And if you call them to guidance, they follow you not. It is the same for you whether you call them or you keep silent"
  7,194,"Verily, those whom you call upon besides Allah are servants like you. So call upon them and let them answer you if you are truthful"
  7,195,"Have they feet wherewith they walk Or have they hands wherewith they hold Or have they eyes wherewith they see Or have they ears wherewith they hear Say: \"Call your (so-called) partners (of Allah) and then plot against me, and give me no respite"
