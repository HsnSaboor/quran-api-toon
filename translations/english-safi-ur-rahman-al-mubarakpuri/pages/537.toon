quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation
  56,78,In a Book Maknun
  56,79,Which none touches but the pure ones
  56,80,A revelation from the Lord of all that exists
  56,81,Is it such a talk that you are Mudhinun
  56,82,And you make your provision your denial
  56,83,Then why do you not (intervene) when it reaches Al-Hulqum
  56,84,And you at the moment are looking
  56,85,"But We are nearer to him than you, but you see not"
  56,86,Then why do you not -- if you are not Madinin
  56,87,"Return the soul, if you are truthful"
  56,88,"Then, if he be of the Muqarrabin"
  56,89,"Then Rawh, Rayhan and a Garden of Delights"
  56,90,And if he be of those on the right
  56,91,Then Salam (peace) to you from those on the right
  56,92,"But if he be of the denying, the erring"
  56,93,Then for him is an entertainment with Hamim
  56,94,And entry in Hellfire
  56,95,"Verily, this! This is an absolute truth with certainty"
  56,96,"So, glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great"
  57,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah -- and He is the Almighty, All-Wise"
  57,2,His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. It is He Who gives life and causes death; and He is Able to do all things
  57,3,"He is Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir, Az-Zahir and Al-Batin. And He is the All-Knower of everything"
