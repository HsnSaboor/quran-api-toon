quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,And grant me an honorable mention in later generations
  26,85,And make me one of the inheritors of the Paradise of Delight
  26,86,"And forgive my father, verily, he is of the erring"
  26,87,And disgrace me not on the Day when they will be resurrected
  26,88,The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail
  26,89,Except him who brings to Allah a clean heart
  26,90,And Paradise will be brought near to those who had Taqwa
  26,91,And the (Hell) Fire will be placed in full view of the astray
  26,92,"And it will be said to them: \"Where are those that you used to worship"
  26,93,Instead of Allah Can they help you or help themselves
  26,94,"Then they will be thrown on their faces into it (the Fire), they and the astray"
  26,95,And all of the hosts of Iblis together
  26,96,They will say while contending therein
  26,97,"By Allah, we were truly in a manifest error"
  26,98,When we held you as equals with the Lord of all that exists
  26,99,And none has brought us into error except the criminals
  26,100,Now we have no intercessors
  26,101,Nor a close friend
  26,102,"(Alas!) If we only had a chance to return, we shall truly be among the believers"
  26,103,"Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers"
  26,104,"And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful"
  26,105,The people of Nuh denied the Messengers
  26,106,"When their brother Nuh said to them: \"Will you not have Taqwa"
  26,107,I am a trustworthy Messenger to you
  26,108,"So have Taqwa of Allah, and obey me"
  26,109,No reward do I ask of you for it; my reward is only from the Lord of all that exists
  26,110,"So have Taqwa of Allah, and obey me"
  26,111,"They said: \"Shall we believe in you, when the inferior follow you"
