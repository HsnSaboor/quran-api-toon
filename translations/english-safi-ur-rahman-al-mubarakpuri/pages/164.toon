quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  7,105,Proper it is for me that I say nothing concerning Allah but the truth. Indeed I have come unto you from your Lord with a clear proof. So let the Children of Israel depart along with me
  7,106,"[Fir`awn] said: \"If you have come with a sign, show it forth, if you are one of those who tell the truth"
  7,107,"Then [Musa] threw his staff and behold! it was a [Thu`ban] serpent, manifest"
  7,108,"And he drew out his hand, and behold! it was white (with radiance) for the beholders"
  7,109,"The chiefs of the people of Fir`awn said: \"This is indeed a well-versed sorcerer"
  7,110,"He wants to get you out of your land, so what do you advise"
  7,111,"They said: \"Put him and his brother off (for a time), and send callers to the cities to collect"
  7,112,That they bring to you all well-versed sorcerers
  7,113,"And so the sorcerers came to Fir`awn. They said: \"Indeed there will be a (good) reward for us if we are the victors"
  7,114,"He said: \"Yes, and moreover you will (in that case) be of the nearest (to me)"
  7,115,"They said: \"O Musa! Either you throw (first), or shall we have the (first) throw"
  7,116,"He [Musa] said: \"Throw you (first).\" So when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them, and they displayed a great trick"
  7,117,"And We revealed to Musa (saying): \"Throw your stick,\" and behold! It swallowed up straight away all the falsehood which they showed"
  7,118,"Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect"
  7,119,So they were defeated there and returned disgraced
  7,120,And the sorcerers fell down prostrate
