quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,41,And O my people! How is it that I call you to salvation while you call me to the Fire
  40,42,"You invite me to disbelieve in Allah, and to join partners in worship with Him of which I have no knowledge; and I invite you to the Almighty, the Oft-Forgiving"
  40,43,"La Jarama, you call me to one that does not have a claim in this world or in the Hereafter. And our return will be to Allah, and the transgressors, they shall be the dwellers of the Fire"
  40,44,"And you will remember what I am telling you, and my affair I leave it to Allah. Verily, Allah is the All-Seer of (His) servants"
  40,45,"So, Allah saved him from the evils that they plotted (against him), while an evil torment encompassed Fir`awn's people"
  40,46,"The Fire, they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon. And on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to the angels): \"Admit Fir`awn's people into the severest torment"
  40,47,"And, when they will dispute in the Fire, the weak will say to those who were arrogant: \"Verily, we followed you, can you then take from us some portion of the Fire"
  40,48,"Those who were arrogant will say: \"We are all (together) in this (Fire)! Verily, Allah has judged between (His) servants"
  40,49,"And those in the Fire will say to the keepers (angels) of Hell: \"Call upon your Lord to lighten for us the torment for a day"
