quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you How do you decide
  37,155,Will you not then remember
  37,156,Or is there for you a plain authority
  37,157,Then bring your Book if you are truthful
  37,158,"And they have invented a kinship between Him and the Jinn, but the Jinn know well that they have indeed to appear (before Him)"
  37,159,Glorified be Allah! (He is free) from what they attribute unto Him
  37,160,"Except the servants of Allah, whom He chooses"
  37,161,"So, verily you and those whom you worship"
  37,162,Cannot lead astray
  37,163,Except those who are predestined to burn in Hell
  37,164,And there is not one of us (angels) but has his known place
  37,165,"And verily, we (angels), we stand in rows"
  37,166,"And verily, we (angels) indeed are those who glorify"
  37,167,And indeed they used to say
  37,168,If we had a reminder as had the men of old
  37,169,We would have indeed been the chosen servants of Allah
  37,170,"But (now) they disbelieve therein, so they will come to know"
  37,171,"And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our servants, the Messengers"
  37,172,That they verily would be made triumphant
  37,173,And that Our hosts! they verily would be the victors
  37,174,"So, turn away from them for a while"
  37,175,And watch them and they shall see
  37,176,Do they seek to hasten on Our torment
  37,177,"Then, when it descends in their courtyard, evil will be the morning for those who had warned"
  37,178,"So, turn away from them for a while"
  37,179,And watch and they shall see
  37,180,"Glorified be your Lord, the Lord of Al-`Izzah! (He is free) from what they attribute unto Him"
  37,181,And Salam (peace!) be on the Messengers
  37,182,"And all the praises and thanks be to Allah, Lord of all that exists"
