quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  13,35,"The description of the Paradise which those who have Taqwa have been promised: Underneath it rivers flow, its provision is eternal and so is its shade; this is the end (final destination) of those who have Taqwa, and the end (final destination) of the disbelievers is Fire"
  13,36,"Those to whom We have given the Book, rejoice at what has been revealed unto you, but there are among the Ahzab (Confederates) those who reject a part thereof. Say: \"I am commanded only to worship Allah and not to join partners with Him. To Him I call and to Him is my return"
  13,37,"And thus have We sent it (the Qur'an) down to be a judgement of authority in Arabic. Were you to follow their (vain) desires after the knowledge which has come to you, then you will not have any Wali (protector) or defender against Allah"
  13,38,"And indeed We sent Messengers before you, and made for them wives and offspring. And it was not for a Messenger to bring a sign except by Allah's leave. (For) every matter there is a decree (from Allah)"
  13,39,Allah blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother of the Book
  13,40,"Whether We show you part of what We have promised them or cause you to die, your duty is only to convey (the Message) and on Us is the reckoning"
  13,41,"See they not that We gradually reduce the land from its outlying borders. And Allah judges, there is none to put back His judgement, and He is swift at reckoning"
  13,42,"And verily, those before them did devise plots, but all planning is Allah's. He knows what every person earns, and the disbelievers will know who gets the good end (final destination)"
