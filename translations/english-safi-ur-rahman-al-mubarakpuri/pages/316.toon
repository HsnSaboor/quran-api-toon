quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  20,65,"They said: \"O Musa! Either you throw first or we be the first to throw"
  20,66,"[Musa] said: \"Nay, throw you (first)!\" Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast"
  20,67,So Musa conceived fear in himself
  20,68,"We (Allah) said: \"Fear not! Surely, you will have the upper hand"
  20,69,"And throw that which is in your right hand! It will swallow up that which they have made. That which they have made is only a magician's trick, and the magician will never be successful, to whatever amount (of skill) he may attain"
  20,70,"So the magicians fell down prostrate. They said: \"We believe in the Lord of Harun and Musa"
  20,71,"(Fir`awn) said: \"Believe you in him before I give you permission Verily, he is your chief who has taught you magic. So I will surely cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will surely crucify you on the trunks of date palms, and you shall surely know which of us can give the severe and more lasting torment"
  20,72,"They said: \"We prefer you not over what have come to us of the clear signs and to Him (Allah) Who created us. So, decree whatever you desire to decree, for you can only' decree (regarding) this life of the world"
  20,73,"Verily, we have believed in our Lord, that He may forgive us our faults, and the magic to which you did compel us. And Allah is better as regards reward in comparison to your reward, and more lasting"
  20,74,"Verily, whoever comes to his Lord as a criminal, then surely, for him is Hell, wherein he will neither die nor live"
  20,75,"But whoever comes to Him as a believer, and has done righteous good deeds, for such are the high ranks"
  20,76,"Adn Gardens, under which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever, and such is the reward of those who purify themselves"
