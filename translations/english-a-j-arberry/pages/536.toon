quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  56,51,"Then you erring ones, you that cried lies"
  56,52,you shall eat of a tree called Zakkoum
  56,53,and you shall fill therewith your bellies
  56,54,and drink on top of that boiling water
  56,55,lapping it down like thirsty camels
  56,56,This shall be their hospitality on the Day of Doom
  56,57,We created you; therefore why will you not believe
  56,58,Have you considered the seed you spill
  56,59,"Do you yourselves create it, or are We the Creators"
  56,60,We have decreed among you Death; We shall not be outstripped
  56,61,"that We may exchange the likes of you, and make you to grow again in a fashion you know not"
  56,62,You have known the first growth; so why will you not remember
  56,63,Have you considered the soil you till
  56,64,"Do you yourselves sow it, or are We the Sowers"
  56,65,"Did We will, We would make it broken orts, and you would remain bitterly jesting"
  56,66,We are debt-loaded
  56,67,"nay, we have been robbed"
  56,68,Have you considered the water you drink
  56,69,"Did you send it down from the clouds, or did We send it"
  56,70,"Did We will, We would make it bitter; so why are you not thankful"
  56,71,Have you considered the fire you kindle
  56,72,"Did you make its timber to grow, or did We make it"
  56,73,"We Ourselves made it for a reminder, and a boon to the desert-dwellers"
  56,74,"Then magnify the Name of thy Lord, the All-mighty"
  56,75,No! I swear by the fallings of the stars
  56,76,"and that is indeed a mighty oath, did you but know it"
