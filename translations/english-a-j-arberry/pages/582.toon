quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,Of what do they question one another
  78,2,Of the mighty tiding
  78,3,whereon they are at variance
  78,4,No indeed; they shall soon know
  78,5,"Again, no indeed; they shall soon know"
  78,6,Have We not made the earth as a cradle
  78,7,and the mountains as pegs
  78,8,And We created you in pairs
  78,9,and We appointed your sleep for a rest
  78,10,and We appointed night for a garment
  78,11,and We appointed day for a livelihood
  78,12,And We have built above you seven strong ones
  78,13,and We appointed a blazing lamp
  78,14,and have sent down out of the rainclouds water cascading
  78,15,that We may bring forth thereby grain and plants
  78,16,and gardens luxuriant
  78,17,Surely the Day of Decision is an appointed time
  78,18,"the day the Trumpet is blown, and you shall come in troops"
  78,19,"and heaven is opened, and become gates"
  78,20,"and the mountains are set in motion, and become a vapour"
  78,21,"Behold, Gehenna has become an ambush"
  78,22,for the insolent a resort
  78,23,therein to tarry for ages
  78,24,tasting therein neither coolness nor any drink
  78,25,save boiling water and pus
  78,26,for a suitable recompense
  78,27,They indeed hoped not for a reckoning
  78,28,and they cried loud lies to Our signs
  78,29,and everything We have numbered in a Book
  78,30,Taste! We shall increase you not save in chastisement
