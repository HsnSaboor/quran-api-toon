quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By heaven and the night-star
  86,2,And what shall teach thee what is the night-star
  86,3,The piercing star
  86,4,Over every soul there is a watcher
  86,5,So let man consider of what he was created
  86,6,he was created of gushing water
  86,7,issuing between the loins and the breast-bones
  86,8,Surely He is able to bring him back
  86,9,upon the day when the secrets are tried
  86,10,"and he shall have no strength, no helper"
  86,11,By heaven of the returning rain
  86,12,by earth splitting with verdure
  86,13,surely it is a decisive word
  86,14,it is no merriment
  86,15,They are devising guile
  86,16,and I am devising guile
  86,17,So respite the unbelievers; delay with them awhile
  87,1,Magnify the Name of thy Lord the Most High
  87,2,who created and shaped
  87,3,who determined and guided
  87,4,who brought forth the pasturage
  87,5,then made it a blackening wrack
  87,6,"We shall make thee recite, to forget not"
  87,7,save what God wills; surely He knows what is spoken aloud and what is hidden
  87,8,We shall ease thee unto the Easing
  87,9,"Therefore remind, if the Reminder profits"
  87,10,and he who fears shall remember
  87,11,but the most wretched shall flout it
  87,12,even he who shall roast in the Great Fire
  87,13,"then he shall neither die therein, nor live"
  87,14,Prosperous is he who has cleansed himself
  87,15,"and mentions the Name of his Lord, and prays"
