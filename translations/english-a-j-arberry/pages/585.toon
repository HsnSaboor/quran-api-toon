quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and turned away
  80,2,that the blind man came to him
  80,3,And what should teach thee? Perchance he would cleanse him
  80,4,"or yet remember, and the Reminder profit him"
  80,5,But the self-sufficient
  80,6,to him thou attendest
  80,7,"though it is not thy concern, if he does not cleanse himself"
  80,8,And he who comes to thee eagerly
  80,9,and fearfully
  80,10,to him thou payest no heed
  80,11,No indeed; it is a Reminder
  80,12,"and whoso wills, shall remember it"
  80,13,upon pages high-honoured
  80,14,"uplifted, purified"
  80,15,by the hands of scribes
  80,16,"noble, pious"
  80,17,Perish Man! How unthankful he is
  80,18,Of what did He create him
  80,19,"Of a sperm-drop He created him, and determined him"
  80,20,then the way eased for him
  80,21,"then makes him to die, and buries him"
  80,22,"then, when He wills, He raises him"
  80,23,No indeed! Man has not accomplished His bidding
  80,24,Let Man consider his nourishment
  80,25,We poured out the rains abundantly
  80,26,then We split the earth in fissures
  80,27,and therein made the grains to grow
  80,28,"and vines, and reeds"
  80,29,"and olives, and palms"
  80,30,and dense-tree'd gardens
  80,31,"and fruits, and pastures"
  80,32,an enjoyment for you and your flocks
  80,33,And when the Blast shall sound
  80,34,upon the day when a man shall flee from his brother
  80,35,"his mother, his father"
  80,36,"his consort, his sons"
  80,37,every man that day shall have business to suffice him
  80,38,Some faces on that day shall shine
  80,39,"laughing, joyous"
  80,40,some faces on that day shall be dusty
  80,41,o'erspread with darkness
  80,42,"those -- they are the unbelievers, the libertines"
