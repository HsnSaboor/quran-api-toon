quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Thy Lord knows that thou keepest vigil nearly two-thirds of the night, or a half of it, or a third of it, and a party of those with thee; and God determines the night and the day. He knows that you will not number it, and He has turned towards you. Therefore recite of the Koran so much as is feasible. He knows that some of you are sick, and others journeying in the land, seeking the bounty of God, and others fighting in the way of God. So recite of it so much as is feasible. And perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and lend to God a good loan. Whatever good you shall forward to your souls' account, you shall find it with God as better, and mightier a wage. And ask God's forgiveness; God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate"
  74,1,O thou shrouded in thy mantle
  74,2,"arise, and warn"
  74,3,Thy Lord magnify
  74,4,thy robes purify
  74,5,and defilement flee
  74,6,"Give not, thinking to gain greater"
  74,7,and be patient unto thy Lord
  74,8,For when the Trump is sounded
  74,9,that day will be a harsh day
  74,10,for the unbelievers not easy
  74,11,Leave Me with him whom I created alone
  74,12,and appointed for him ample wealth
  74,13,and sons standing before him
  74,14,and made all things smooth for him
  74,15,then he is eager that I should do more
  74,16,Nay! He is forward unto Our signs
  74,17,and I shall constrain him to a hard ascent
