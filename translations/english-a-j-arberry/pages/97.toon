quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"No good is there in much of their conspiring, except for him who bids to freewill offering, or honour, or setting things right between the people. Whoso does that, seeking God's good pleasure, We shall surely give him a mighty wage"
  4,115,"But whoso makes a breach with the Messenger after the guidance has become clear to him and follows a way other than the believers', him We shall turn over to what he has turned to and We shall roast him in Gehenna - an evil homecoming"
  4,116,"God forgives not that aught should be with Him associated; less than that He forgives to whomsoever He will. Whoso associates with God anything, has gone astray into far error"
  4,117,"In stead of Him, they pray not except to female beings; they pray not except to a rebel Satan accursed by God"
  4,118,"He said, 'Assuredly I will take unto myself a portion appointed of Thy servants"
  4,119,"and I will lead them astray, and fill them with fancies and I will command them and they will cut off the cattle's ears; I will command them and they will alter God's creation.' Whoso takes Satan to him for a friend, instead of God, has surely suffered a manifest loss"
  4,120,"He promises them and fills them with fancies, but there is nothing Satan promises them except delusion"
  4,121,"Such men -- their refuge shall be Gehenna, and they shall find no asylum from it"
