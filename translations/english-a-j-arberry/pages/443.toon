quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,And a sign for them is that We carried their seed in the laden ship
  36,42,and We have created for them the like of it whereon they ride
  36,43,"and if We will, We drown them, then none have they to cry to, neither are they delivered"
  36,44,"save as a mercy from Us, and enjoyment for a while"
  36,45,"And when it is said to them, 'Fear what is before you and what is behind you; haply you will find mercy"
  36,46,"yet never any sign of the signs of their Lord comes to them, but they are turning away from it"
  36,47,"And when it is said to them, 'Expend of that God has provided you,' the unbelievers say to the believers, 'What, shall we feed such a one whom, if God willed, He would feed? You are only in manifest error"
  36,48,"They also say, 'When shall this promise come to pass, if you speak truly"
  36,49,They are awaiting only for one Cry to seize them while they are yet disputing
  36,50,"then they will not be able to make any testament, nor will they return to their people"
  36,51,"And the Trumpet shall be blown; then behold, they are sliding down from their tombs unto their Lord"
  36,52,"They say, 'Alas for us! Who roused us out of our sleeping place? This is what the All-merciful promised, and the Envoys spoke truly"
  36,53,"It was only one Cry; then behold, they are all arraigned before Us"
  36,54,"So today no soul shall be wronged anything, and you shall not be recompensed, except according to what you have been doing"
