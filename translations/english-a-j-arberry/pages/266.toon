quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  15,71,"He said, 'These are my daughters, if you would be doing"
  15,72,"By thy life, they wandered blindly in their dazzlement"
  15,73,and the Cry seized them at the sunrise
  15,74,and We turned it uppermost nethermost and rained on it stones of baked clay
  15,75,Surely in that are signs for such as mark
  15,76,surely it is on a way yet remaining
  15,77,surely in that is a sign for believers
  15,78,Certainly the dwellers in the Thicket were evildoers
  15,79,and We took vengeance on them. The two of them were upon a roadway manifest
  15,80,The dwellers in El-Hijr cried lies to the Envoys
  15,81,"We brought them. Our signs, and they turned away from them"
  15,82,"They were hewing the mountains into houses, therein dwelling securely"
  15,83,and the Cry seized them in the morning
  15,84,that they earned did not avail them
  15,85,"We created not the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, save in truth. Surely the Hour is coming; so pardon thou, with a gracious pardoning"
  15,86,"Surely thy Lord, He is the All-creator, the All-knowing"
  15,87,"We have given thee seven of the oft-repeated, and the mighty Koran"
  15,88,"Stretch not thine eyes to that We have given pairs of them to enjoy; and do not sorrow for them, and lower thy wing unto the believers"
  15,89,"and say, 'Surely, I am the manifest warner"
  15,90,So We sent it down to the partitioners
