quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,25,Why help you not one another
  37,26,No indeed; but today they resign themselves in submission
  37,27,"and advance one upon another, asking each other questions"
  37,28,"These say, 'Why, you of old would come to us from the right hand"
  37,29,"Those say, 'No; on the contrary, you were not believers"
  37,30,"we had no authority over you; no, you were an insolent people"

  37,47,"wherein no sickness is, neither intoxication"
  37,48,and with them wide-eyed maidens restraining their glances
  37,49,as if they were hidden pearls
  37,50,"They advance one upon another, asking each other questions"
  37,51,"One of them says, 'I had a comrade"
