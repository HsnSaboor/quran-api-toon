quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  51,7,By heaven with all its tracks
  51,8,surely you speak at variance

  51,27,"and he laid it before them saying, 'Will you not eat"
  51,28,"Then he conceived a fear of them. They said, 'Be not afraid!' And they gave him good tidings of a cunning boy"
  51,29,"Then came forward his wife, clamouring, and she smote her face, and said, 'An old woman, barren"
  51,30,"They said, 'So says thy Lord; He is the All-wise, the All-knowing"
