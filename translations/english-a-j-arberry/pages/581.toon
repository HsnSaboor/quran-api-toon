quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Did We not create you of a mean water
  77,21,that We laid within a sure lodging
  77,22,till a known term decreed
  77,23,We determined; excellent determiners are We
  77,24,Woe that day unto those who cry it lies
  77,25,Made We not the earth to be a housing
  77,26,for the living and for the dead
  77,27,Set We not therein soaring mountains? Sated you with sweetest water
  77,28,Woe that day unto those who cry it lies
  77,29,Depart to that you cried was lies
  77,30,Depart to a triple-massing shadow
  77,31,unshading against the blazing flame
  77,32,that shoots sparks like dry faggots
  77,33,sparks like to golden herds
  77,34,Woe that day unto those who cry it lies
  77,35,This is the day they shall not speak
  77,36,"neither be given leave, and excuse themselves"
  77,37,Woe that day unto those who cry it lies
  77,38,This is the Day of Decision; We have joined you with the ancients
  77,39,"if you have a trick, try you now to trick Me"
  77,40,Woe that day unto those who cry it lies
  77,41,Truly the godfearing shall dwell amid shades and fountains
  77,42,and such fruits as their hearts desire
  77,43,"Eat and drink, with wholesome appetite, for that you were working"
  77,44,Even so do We recompense the good-doers
  77,45,Woe that day unto those who cry it lies
  77,46,Eat and take your joy a little; you are sinners
  77,47,Woe that day unto those who cry it lies
  77,48,"When it is said to them, 'Prostrate yourselves!' they prostrate not"
  77,49,Woe that day unto those who cry it lies
  77,50,In what discourse after this will they believe
