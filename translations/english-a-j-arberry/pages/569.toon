quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,as they are given sight of them. The sinner will wish that he might ransom himself from the chastisement of that day even by his sons
  70,12,"his companion wife, his brother"
  70,13,his kin who sheltered him
  70,14,"and whosoever is in the earth, all together, so that then it might deliver him"
  70,15,"Nay, verily it is a furnace"
  70,16,snatching away the scalp
  70,17,calling him who drew back and turned away
  70,18,who amassed and hoarded
  70,19,Surely man was created fretful
  70,20,"when evil visits him, impatient"
  70,21,"when good visits him, grudging"
  70,22,save those that pray
  70,23,and continue at their prayers
  70,24,those in whose wealth is a right known
  70,25,for the beggar and the outcast
  70,26,who confirm the Day of Doom
  70,27,and go in fear of the chastisement of their Lord
  70,28,from their Lord's chastisement none feels secure
  70,29,and guard their private parts
  70,30,"save from their wives and what their right hands own, then not being blameworthy"
  70,31,"but whoso seeks after more than that, they are the transgressors"
  70,32,and who preserve their trusts and their covenant
  70,33,and perform their witnessings
  70,34,and who observe their prayers
  70,35,"Those shall be in Gardens, high-honoured"
  70,36,"What ails the unbelievers, running with outstretched necks"
  70,37,towards thee on the right hand and on the left hand in knots
  70,38,"What, is every man of them eager to be admitted to a Garden of Bliss"
  70,39,Not so; for We have created them of what they know
