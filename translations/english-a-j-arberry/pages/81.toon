quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  4,20,"And if you desire to exchange a wife in place of another, and you have given to one a hundredweight, take of it nothing. What, will you take it by way of calumny and manifest sin"
  4,21,"How shall you take it, when each of you has been privily with the other, and they have taken from you a solemn compact"
  4,22,"And do not marry women that your fathers married, unless it be a thing of the past; surely that is indecent and hateful; an evil way"
  4,23,"Forbidden to you are your mothers and daughters, your sisters, your aunts paternal and maternal, your brother's daughters, your sister's daughters, your mothers who have given suck to you, your suckling sisters, your wives' mothers, your stepdaughters who are in your care being born of your wives you have been in to -- but if you have not yet been in to them it is no fault in you - and the spouses of your sons who are of your loins, and that you should take to you two sisters together, unless it be a thing of the past; God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate"
