quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  54,7,"abasing their eyes, they shall come forth from the tombs as if they were scattered grasshoppers"
  54,8,"running with outstretched necks to the Caller. The unbelievers shall say, 'This is a hard day"
  54,9,"The people of Noah cried lies before them; they cried lies to Our servant, and said, 'A man possessed!' And he was rejected"
  54,10,"And so he called unto his Lord, saying, 'I am vanquished; do Thou succour me"
  54,11,Then We opened the gates of heaven unto water torrential
  54,12,"and made the earth to gush with fountains, and the waters met for a matter decreed"
  54,13,And We bore him upon a well-planked vessel well-caulked
  54,14,running before Our eyes-a recompense for him denied
  54,15,And We left it for a sign. Is there any that will remember
  54,16,How then were My chastisement and My warnings
  54,17,Now We have made the Koran easy for Remembrance. Is there any that will remember
  54,18,Ad cried lies. How then were My chastisement and My warnings
  54,19,We loosed against them a wind clamorous in a day of ill fortune continuous
  54,20,plucking up men as if they were stumps of uprooted palm-trees
  54,21,How then were My chastisement and My warnings
  54,22,Now We have made the Koran easy for Remembrance. Is there any that will remember
  54,23,Thamood cried lies to the warnings
  54,24,"and said, 'What, shall we follow a mortal, one out of ourselves? Then indeed we should be in error and insanity"
  54,25,"Has the Reminder been cast upon him alone among us? Nay, rather he is an impudent liar"
  54,26,They shall surely know tomorrow who is the impudent liar
  54,27,They shall send the She-camel as a trial for them; so watch thou them and keep patience
