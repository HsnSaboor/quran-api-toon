quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,and that which is in the breasts is brought out
  100,11,surely on that day their Lord shall be aware of them
  101,1,The Clatterer
  101,2,What is the Clatterer
  101,3,And what shall teach thee what is the Clatterer
  101,4,The day that men shall be like scattered moths
  101,5,and the mountains shall be like plucked wool-tufts
  101,6,Then he whose deeds weigh heavy in the Balance
  101,7,shall inherit a pleasing life
  101,8,but he whose deeds weigh light in the Balance
  101,9,shall plunge in the womb of the Pit
  101,10,And what shall teach thee what is the Pit
  101,11,A blazing Fire
  102,1,Gross rivalry diverts you
  102,2,even till you visit the tombs
  102,3,No indeed; but soon you shall know
  102,4,"Again, no indeed; but soon you shall know"
  102,5,No indeed; did you know with the knowledge of certainty
  102,6,you shall surely see Hell
  102,7,"Again, you shall surely see it with the eye of certainty"
  102,8,then you shall be questioned that day concerning true bliss
