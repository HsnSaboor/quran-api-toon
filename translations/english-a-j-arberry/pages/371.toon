  26,84,and appoint me a tongue of truthfulness among the others
  26,85,Make me one of the inheritors of the Garden of Bliss
  26,86,"and forgive my father, for he is one of those astray"
  26,87,Degrade me not upon the day when they are raised up
  26,88,the day when neither wealth nor sons shall profit

  26,109,I ask of you no wage for this; my wage falls only upon the Lord of all Being
  26,110,"so fear you God, and obey you me"
