quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"To Him is referred the knowledge of the Hour. Not a fruit comes forth from its sheath, no female bears or brings forth, save with His knowledge. Upon the day when He shall call to them, 'Where now are My associates?' they shall say, 'We proclaim to Thee, there is not a witness among us"
  41,48,Then that they called upon before will go astray from them and they will think that they have no asylum
  41,49,"Man wearies not of praying for good; but when evil visits him, then he is cast down and desperate"
  41,50,"And if We let him taste mercy from Us after hardship that has visited him, he surely says, 'This is mine; I think not the Hour is coming. If I am returned to my Lord, surely the reward most fair with Him will be mine.' Then We shall tell the unbelievers the things they have done, and assuredly We shall let them taste a harsh chastisement"
  41,51,"And when We bless man, he turns away and withdraws aside; but when evil visits him, he is full of endless prayers"
  41,52,"Say: 'What think you? If it is from God, then you disbelieve in it, who is further astray than he who is in wide schism"
  41,53,"We shall show them Our signs in the horizons and in themselves, till it is clear to them that it is the truth. Suffices it not as to thy Lord, that He is witness over everything"
  41,54,Are they not in doubt touching the encounter with their Lord? Does He not encompass everything
