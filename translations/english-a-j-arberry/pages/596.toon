  92,16,"even he who cried lies, and turned away"
  92,17,and from which the most godfearing shall be removed
  92,18,even he who gives his wealth. to purify himself
  92,19,and confers no favour on any man for recompense
  92,20,only seeking the Face of his Lord the Most High

  94,2,and lift from thee thy burden
  94,3,the burden that weighed down thy back
