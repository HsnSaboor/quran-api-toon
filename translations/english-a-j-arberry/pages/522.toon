quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"Said he, 'And what is your business, envoys"
  51,32,"They said, 'We have been sent to a people of sinners"
  51,33,to loose upon them stones of clay
  51,34,marked with thy Lord for the prodigal
  51,35,So We brought forth such believers as were in it
  51,36,but We found not therein except one house of those that have surrendered themselves
  51,37,And therein We left a sign to those who fear the painful chastisement
  51,38,"And also in Moses, when We sent him unto Pharaoh, with a clear authority"
  51,39,"but he turned his back, with his court, saying, 'A sorcerer, or a man possessed"
  51,40,"So We seized him and his hosts, and We cast them into the sea, and he blameworthy"
  51,41,"And also in Ad, when We loosed against them the withering wind"
  51,42,"that left nothing it came upon, but made it as stuff decayed"
  51,43,"And also in Thamood, when it was said to them, 'Take your enjoyment for a while"
  51,44,"Then they turned in disdain from the commandment of their Lord, and the thunderbolt took them and they themselves beholding"
  51,45,"and they were not able to stand upright, and were not helped"
  51,46,And the people of Noah before; surely they were an ungodly people
  51,47,"And heaven -- We built it with might, and We extend it wide"
  51,48,And the earth -- We spread it forth; O excellent Smoothers
  51,49,And of everything created We two kinds; haply you will remember
  51,50,Therefore flee unto God! I am a clear warner from Him to you
  51,51,And set not up with God another god; I am a clear warner from Him to you
