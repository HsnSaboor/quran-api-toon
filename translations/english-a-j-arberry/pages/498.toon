  44,40,"Surely the Day of Decision shall be their appointed time, all together"
  44,41,"the day a master shall avail nothing a client, and they shall not be helped"
  44,42,"save him upon whom God has mercy; He is the All-mighty, the All-compassionate"
  44,43,"Lo, the Tree of Ez-Zakkoum"
  44,44,is the food of the guilty
  44,45,"like molten copper, bubbling in the belly"
  44,46,as boiling water bubbles
  44,47,"Take him, and thrust him into the midst of Hell"
  44,48,then pour over his head the chastisement of boiling water
  44,49,"Taste! Surely thou art the mighty, the noble"
  44,50,This is that concerning which you were doubting
  44,51,Surely the godfearing shall be in a station secure

  44,55,"therein calling for every fruit, secure"
  44,56,"They shall not taste therein of death, save the first death, And He shall guard them against the chastisement of Hell"
  44,57,a bounty from thy Lord; that is the mighty triumph
  44,58,"Now We have made it easy by thy tongue, that haply they may remember"
  44,59,So be on the watch; they too are on the watch
