quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,No indeed; the Book of the libertines is in Sijjin
  83,8,and what shall teach thee what is Sijjin
  83,9,A book inscribed
  83,10,Woe that day unto those who cry it lies
  83,11,who cry lies to the Day of Doom
  83,12,and none cries lies to it but every guilty aggressor
  83,13,"When our signs are recited to him, he says, 'Fairy-tales of the ancients"
  83,14,No indeed; but that they were earning has rusted upon their hearts
  83,15,No indeed; but upon that day they shall be veiled from their Lord
  83,16,then they shall roast in Hell
  83,17,"Then it shall be said to them, 'This is that you cried lies to"
  83,18,No indeed; the book of the pious is in Illiyun
  83,19,and what shall teach thee what is Illiyun
  83,20,A book inscribed
  83,21,witnessed by those brought nigh
  83,22,Surely the pious shall be in bliss
  83,23,upon couches gazing
  83,24,thou knowest in their faces the radiancy of bliss
  83,25,as they are given to drink of a wine sealed
  83,26,whose seal is musk -- so after that let the strivers strive
  83,27,and whose mixture is Tasnim
  83,28,a fountain at which do drink those brought nigh
  83,29,"Behold, the sinners were laughing at the believers"
  83,30,when them passed them by winking at one another
  83,31,and when they returned to their people they returned blithely
  83,32,"and when they saw them they said, 'Lo, these men are astray"
  83,33,Yet they were not sent as watchers over them
  83,34,So today the believers are laughing at the unbelievers
