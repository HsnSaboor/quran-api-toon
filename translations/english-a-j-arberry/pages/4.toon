quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"The likeness of them is as the likeness of a man who kindled a fire, and when it lit all about him God took away their light, and left them in darkness unseeing"
  2,18,"deaf, dumb, blind -- so they shall not return"
  2,19,"or as a cloudburst out of heaven in which is darkness, and thunder, and lightning -- they put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps, fearful of death; and God encompasses the unbelievers"
  2,20,"the lightning wellnigh snatches away their sight; whensoever it gives them light, they walk in it, and when the darkness is over them, they halt; had God willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight. Truly, God is powerful over everything"
  2,21,"O you men, serve your Lord Who created you, and those that were before you; haply so you will be godfearing"
  2,22,"who assigned to you the earth for a couch, and heaven for an edifice, and sent down out of heaven water, wherewith He brought forth fruits for your provision; so set not up compeers to God wittingly"
  2,23,"And if you are in doubt concerning that We have sent down on Our servant, then bring a sura like it, and call your witnesses, apart from God, if you are truthful"
  2,24,"And if you do not -- and you will not -- then fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for unbelievers"
