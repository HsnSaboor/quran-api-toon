quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,"How can you disbelieve, seeing you have God's signs recited to you, and His Messenger among you? Whosoever holds fast to God, he is guided to a straight path"
  3,102,"O believers, fear God as He should be feared, and see you do not die, save in surrender"
  3,103,"And hold you fast to God's bond, together, and do not scatter; remember God's blessing upon you when you were enemies, and He brought your hearts together, so that by His blessing you became brothers. You were upon the brink of a pit of Fire, and He delivered you from it; even so God makes clear to you His signs; so haply you will be guided"
  3,104,"Let there be one nation of you, calling to good, and bidding to honour, and forbidding dishonour; those are the prosperers"
  3,105,Be not as those who scattered and fell into variance after the clear signs came to them; those there awaits a mighty chastisement
  3,106,"the day when some faces are blackened, and some faces whitened. As for those whose faces are blackened -- 'Did you disbelieve after you had believed? Then taste the chastisement for that you disbelieved"
  3,107,"But as for those whose faces are whitened, they shall be in God's mercy, therein dwelling forever"
  3,108,"These are the signs of God We recite to thee in truth, and God desires not any injustice to living beings"
