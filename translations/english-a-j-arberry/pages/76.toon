quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,195,"And their Lord answers them: 'I waste not the labour of any that labours among you, be you male or female -- the one of you is as the other. And those who emigrated, and were expelled from their habitations, those who suffered hurt in My way, and fought, and were slain -- them I shall surely acquit of their evil deeds, and I shall admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow.' A reward from God! And God with Him is the fairest reward"
  3,196,"Let it not delude thee, that the unbelievers go to and fro in the land"
  3,197,"a little enjoyment, then their refuge is Gehenna -- an evil cradling"
  3,198,"But those who fear their Lord - for them shall be gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling forever -- a hospitality God Himself offers; and that which is with God is better for the pious"
  3,199,"And some there are of the People of the Book who believe in God, and what has been sent down unto you, and what has been sent down unto them, men humble to God, not selling the signs of God for a small price; those -- their wage is with their Lord; God is swift at the reckoning"
  3,200,"O believers, be patient, and vie you in patience; be steadfast; fear God; haply so you will prosper"
