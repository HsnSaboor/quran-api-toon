quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  67,1,Blessed be He in whose hand is the Kingdom -- He is powerful over everything
  67,2,"who created death and life, that He might try you which of you is fairest in works; and He is the All-mighty, the All-forgiving"
  67,3,who created seven heavens one upon another. Thou seest not in the creation of the All-merciful any imperfection. Return thy gaze; seest thou any fissure
  67,4,"Then return thy gaze again, and again, and thy gaze comes back to thee dazzled, aweary"
  67,5,"And We adorned the lower heaven with lamps, and made them things to stone Satans; and We have prepared for them the chastisement of the Blaze"
  67,6,And for those who disbelieve in their Lord there awaits the chastisement of Gehenna -- an evil homecoming
  67,7,"When they are cast into it they will hear it sighing, the while it boils"
  67,8,"and wellnigh bursts asunder with rage. As often as a troop is cast into it, its keepers ask them, 'Came there no warner to you"
  67,9,"They say, 'Yes indeed, a warner came to us; but we cried lies, saying, \"God has not sent down anything; you are only in great error"
  67,10,"They also say, 'If we had only heard, or had understood, we would not have been of the inhabitants of the Blaze"
  67,11,So they confess their sins. Curse the inhabitants of the Blaze
  67,12,Surely those who fear their Lord in the Unseen -- there awaits them forgiveness and a great wage
