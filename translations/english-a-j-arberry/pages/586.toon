quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun shall be darkened
  81,2,when the stars shall be thrown down
  81,3,when the mountains shall be set moving
  81,4,when the pregnant camels shall be neglected
  81,5,when the savage beasts shall be mustered
  81,6,when the seas shall be set boiling
  81,7,when the souls shall be coupled
  81,8,when the buried infant shall be asked
  81,9,for what sin she was slain
  81,10,when the scrolls shall be unrolled
  81,11,when heaven shall be stripped off
  81,12,when Hell shall be set blazing
  81,13,when Paradise shall be brought nigh
  81,14,then shall a soul know what it has produced
  81,15,No! I swear by the slinkers
  81,16,"the runners, the sinkers"
  81,17,by the night swarming
  81,18,by the dawn sighing
  81,19,truly this is the word of a noble Messenger
  81,20,"having power, with the Lord of the Throne secure"
  81,21,"obeyed, moreover trusty"
  81,22,Your companion is not possessed
  81,23,he truly saw him on the clear horizon
  81,24,he is not niggardly of the Unseen
  81,25,And it is not the word of an accursed Satan
  81,26,where then are you going
  81,27,It is naught but a Reminder unto all beings
  81,28,for whosoever of you who would go straight
  81,29,"but will you shall not, unless God wills, the Lord of all Being"
