quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,But they cried him lies; so they will be among the arraigned
  37,128,except for God's sincere servants
  37,129,and We left for him among the later folk
  37,130,Peace be upon Elias
  37,131,Even so We recompense the good-doers
  37,132,he was among Our believing servants
  37,133,Lot too was one of the Envoys
  37,134,when We delivered him and his people all together
  37,135,save an old woman among those that tarried
  37,136,then We destroyed the others
  37,137,and you pass by them in the morning
  37,138,and in the night; will you not understand
  37,139,Jonah too was one of the Envoys
  37,140,when he ran away to the laden ship
  37,141,"and cast lots, and was of the rebutted"
  37,142,"then the whale swallowed him down, and he blameworthy"
  37,143,Now had he not been of those that glorify God
  37,144,he would have tarried in its belly until the day they shall be raised
  37,145,"but We cast him upon the wilderness, and he was sick"
  37,146,and We caused to grow over him a tree of gourds
  37,147,"Then We sent him unto a hundred thousand, or more"
  37,148,and they believed; so We gave them enjoyment for a while
  37,149,"So ask them for a pronouncement -- Has thy Lord daughters, and they sons"
  37,150,"Or did We create the angels females, while they were witnesses"
  37,151,Is it not of their own calumny that they say
  37,152,God has begotten?' They are truly liars
  37,153,Has He chosen daughters above sons
