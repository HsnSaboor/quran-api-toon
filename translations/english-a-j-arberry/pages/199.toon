quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,73,"O Prophet, struggle with the unbelievers and hypocrites, and be thou harsh with them; their refuge is Gehenna -- an evil homecoming"
  9,74,"They swear by God that they said nothing, but they indeed said the word of unbelief and disbelieved, after they had surrendered. They purposed what they never attained to, and they took revenge only that God enriched them, and His Messenger, of His bounty. So if they repent it will be better for them; if they turn away, God will chastise them with a painful chastisement in this world and the next; on the earth they have no protector or helper"
  9,75,"And some of them have made covenant with God: 'If He gives us of His bounty, we will make offerings and be of the righteous"
  9,76,"Nevertheless, when He gave them of His bounty they were niggardly of it, and turned away, swerving aside"
  9,77,"So as a consequence He put hypocrisy into their hearts, until the day they meet Him, for that they failed God in that they promised Him and they were liars"
  9,78,"Did they not know that God knows their secret and what they conspire together, and that God knows the things unseen"
  9,79,"Those who find fault with the believers who volunteer their freewill offerings, and those who find nothing but their endeavour they deride -- God derides them; for them awaits a painful chastisement"
