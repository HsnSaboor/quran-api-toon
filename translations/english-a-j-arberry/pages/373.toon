  26,137,this is nothing but the habit of the ancients
  26,138,and we shall not be chastised
  26,139,"So they cried him lies; then We destroyed them. Surely in that is a sign, yet most of them are not believers"
  26,140,"Surely thy Lord, He is the All-mighty, the All-compassionate"
  26,141,Thamood cried lies to the Envoys
  26,142,"when their brother Salih said to them, 'Will you not be godfearing"
  26,143,I am for you a faithful Messenger
  26,144,"so fear you God, and obey you me"

  26,146,Will you be left secure in this here
  26,147,among gardens and fountains

  26,150,"So fear you God, and obey you me"
