quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,immortal youths going round about them
  56,18,"with goblets, and ewers, and a cup from a spring"
  56,19,"no brows throbbing, no intoxication"
  56,20,and such fruits as they shall choose
  56,21,and such flesh of fowl as they desire
  56,22,and wide-eyed houris
  56,23,as the likeness of hidden pearls
  56,24,a recompense for that they laboured
  56,25,"Therein they shall hear no idle talk, no cause of sin"
  56,26,"only the saying 'Peace, Peace"
  56,27,The Companions of the Right (O Companions of the Right)
  56,28,mid thornless lote-trees
  56,29,and serried acacias
  56,30,and spreading shade
  56,31,and outpoured waters
  56,32,and fruits abounding
  56,33,"unfailing, unforbidden"
  56,34,and upraised couches
  56,35,"Perfectly We formed them, perfect"
  56,36,and We made them spotless virgins
  56,37,chastely amorous
  56,38,like of age for the Companions of the Right
  56,39,A throng of the ancients
  56,40,and a throng of the later folk
  56,41,The Companions of the Left (O Companions of the Left)
  56,42,mid burning winds and boiling waters
  56,43,and the shadow of a smoking blaze
  56,44,"neither cool, neither goodly"
  56,45,and before that they lived at ease
  56,46,and persisted in the Great Sin
  56,47,"ever saying, 'What, when we are dead and become dust and bones, shall we indeed be raised up"
  56,48,"What, and our fathers, the ancients"
  56,49,"Say: 'The ancients, and the later folk"
  56,50,shall be gathered to the appointed time of a known day
