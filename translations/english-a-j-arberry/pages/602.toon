quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,For the composing of Koraish
  106,2,their composing for the winter and summer caravan
  106,3,So let them serve the Lord of this House
  106,4,who has fed them against hunger and secured them from fear
  107,1,Hast thou seen him who cries lies to the Doom
  107,2,That is he who repulses the orphan
  107,3,and urges not the feeding of the needy
  107,4,So woe to those that pray
  107,5,and are heedless of their prayers
  107,6,to those who make display
  107,7,and refuse charity
  108,1,Surely We have given thee abundance
  108,2,so pray unto thy Lord and sacrifice
  108,3,"Surely he that hates thee, he is the one cut off"
