quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,Then the intercession of the intercessors shall not profit them
  74,49,"What ails them, that they turn away from the Reminder"
  74,50,as if they were startled asses
  74,51,fleeing -- before a lion
  74,52,"Nay, every man of them desires to be -- given -- scrolls unrolled"
  74,53,No indeed; but they do not fear the Hereafter
  74,54,No indeed; surely it is a Reminder
  74,55,so whoever wills shall remember it
  74,56,"And they will not remember, except that God wills; He is worthy to be feared, -- worthy to forgive"
  75,1,No! I swear by the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,No! I swear by the reproachful soul
  75,3,"What, does man reckon We shall not gather his bones"
  75,4,Yes indeed; We are able to shape again his fingers
  75,5,"Nay, but man desires to continue on as a libertine"
  75,6,"asking, 'When shall be the Day of Resurrection"
  75,7,But when the sight is dazed
  75,8,and the moon is eclipsed
  75,9,and the sun and moon are brought together
  75,10,"upon that day man shall say, 'Whither to flee"
  75,11,No indeed; not a refuge
  75,12,Upon that day the recourse shall be to thy Lord
  75,13,Upon that day man shall be told his former deeds and his latter
  75,14,"nay, man shall be a clear proof against himself"
  75,15,even though he offer his excuses
  75,16,Move not thy tongue with it to hasten it
  75,17,"Ours it is to gather it, and to recite it"
  75,18,"So, when We recite it, follow thou its recitation"
  75,19,Then Ours it is to explain it
