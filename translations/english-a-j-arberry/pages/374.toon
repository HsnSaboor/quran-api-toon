quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,The people of Lot cried lies to the Envoys
  26,161,"when their brother Lot said to them, 'Will you not be godfearing"
  26,162,I am for you a faithful Messenger
  26,163,"so fear you God, and obey you me"
  26,164,I ask of you no wage for this; my wage falls only upon the Lord of all Being
  26,165,"What, do you come to male beings"
  26,166,"leaving your wives that your Lord created for you? Nay, but you are a people of transgressors"
  26,167,"They said, 'If thou givest not over, Lot, thou shalt assuredly be one of the expelled"
  26,168,"He said, 'Truly I am a detester of what you do"
  26,169,"My Lord, deliver me and my people from that they do"
  26,170,So We delivered him and his people all together
  26,171,save an old woman among those that tarried
  26,172,then We destroyed the others
  26,173,and We rained on them a rain; and evil is the rain of them that are warned
  26,174,"Surely in that is a sign, yet most of them are not believers"
  26,175,"Surely thy Lord, He is the All-mighty, the All-compassionate"
  26,176,The men of the Thicket cried lies to the Envoys
  26,177,"when Shuaib said to them, 'Will you not be godfearing"
  26,178,"I am for you a faithful Messenger, so fear you God, and obey you me"
  26,179,I ask of you no wage for this
  26,180,my wage falls only upon the Lord of all Being
  26,181,"Fill up the measure, and be not cheaters"
  26,182,and weigh with the straight balance
  26,183,"and diminish not the goods of the people, and do not mischief in the earth, working corruption"
