quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"Those who disbelieve and bar from God's way, God will send their works astray"
  47,2,"But those who believe and do righteous deeds and believe in what is sent down to Muhammad -- and it is the truth from their Lord -- He will acquit them of their evil deeds, and dispose their minds aright"
  47,3,"That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, and those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Even so God strikes their similitudes for men"
  47,4,"When you meet the unbelievers, smite their necks, then, when you have made wide slaughter among them, tie fast the bonds; then set them free, either by grace or ransom, till the war lays down its loads. So it shall be; and if God had willed, He would have avenged Himself upon them; but that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of God, He will not send their works astray"
  47,5,"He will guide them, and dispose their minds aright"
  47,6,"and He will admit them to Paradise, that He has made known to them"
  47,7,"O believers, if you help God, He will help you, and confirm your feet"
  47,8,"But as for the unbelievers, ill chance shall befall them! He will send their works astray"
  47,9,"That is because they have been averse to what God has sent down, so He has made their works to fail"
  47,10,"What, have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them? God destroyed them; the unbelievers shall have the likes thereof"
  47,11,"That is because God is the Protector of the believers, and that the unbelievers have no protector"
