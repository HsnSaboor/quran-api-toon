quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  33,1,"O Prophet, fear God, and obey not the unbelievers and the hypocrites. God is All-knowing, All-wise"
  33,2,And follow what is revealed to thee from thy Lord; surely God is aware of the things you do
  33,3,And put thy trust in God; God suffices as a guardian
  33,4,"God has not assigned to any man two hearts within his breast; nor has He made your wives, when you divorce, saying, 'Be as my mother's back,' truly your mothers, neither has He made your adopted sons your sons in fact. That is your own saying, the words of your mouths; but God speaks the truth, and guides on the way"
  33,5,"Call them after their true fathers; that is more equitable in the sight of God. If you know not who their fathers were, then they are your brothers in religion, and your clients. There is no fault in you if you make mistakes, but only in what your hearts premeditate. God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate"
  33,6,The Prophet is nearer to the believers than their selves; his wives are their mothers. Those who are bound by blood are nearer to one another in the Book of God than the believers and the emigrants; nevertheless you should act towards your friends honourably; that stands inscribed in the Book
