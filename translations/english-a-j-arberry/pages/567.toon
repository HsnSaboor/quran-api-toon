  69,9,"Pharaoh likewise, and those before him, and the Subverted Cities -- they committed error"
  69,10,"and they rebelled against the Messenger of their Lord, and He seized them with a surpassing grip"
  69,11,"Lo, when the waters rose, We bore you in the running ship"
  69,12,that We might make it a reminder for you and for heeding ears to hold
  69,13,"So, when the Trumpet is blown with a single blast"
  69,14,and the earth and the mountains are lifted up and crushed with a single blow
  69,15,"then, on that day, the Terror shall come to pass"
  69,16,"and heaven shall be split, for upon that day it shall be very frail"
  69,17,"and the angels shall stand upon its borders, and upon that day eight shall carry above them the Throne of thy Lord"
  69,18,"On that day you shall be exposed, not one secret of yours concealed"
  69,19,"Then as for him who is given his book in his right hand, he shall say, 'Here, take and read my book"

  69,22,in a lofty Garden
  69,23,its clusters nigh to gather

  69,28,My wealth has not availed me
  69,29,my authority is gone from me
  69,30,"Take him, and fetter him"
  69,31,and then roast him in Hell
  69,32,then in a chain of seventy cubits' length insert him
  69,33,"Behold, he never believed in God the All-mighty"
  69,34,and he never urged the feeding of the needy
