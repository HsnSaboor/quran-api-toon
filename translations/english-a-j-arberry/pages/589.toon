quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,upon couches gazing
  83,36,Have the unbelievers been rewarded what they were doing
  84,1,When heaven is rent asunder
  84,2,"and gives ear to its Lord, and is fitly disposed"
  84,3,when earth is stretched out
  84,4,"and casts forth what is in it, and voids itself"
  84,5,"and gives ear to its Lord, and is fitly disposed"
  84,6,"O Man! Thou art labouring unto thy Lord laboriously, and thou shalt encounter Him"
  84,7,Then as for him who is given his book in his right hand
  84,8,he shall surely receive an easy reckoning
  84,9,and he will return to his family joyfully
  84,10,But as for him who is given his book behind his back
  84,11,he shall call for destruction
  84,12,and he shall roast at a Blaze
  84,13,He once lived among his family joyfully
  84,14,he surely thought he would never revert
  84,15,Yes indeed; his Lord had sight of him
  84,16,No! I swear by the twilight
  84,17,and the night and what it envelops
  84,18,and the moon when it is at the full
  84,19,you shall surely ride stage after stage
  84,20,"Then what ails them, that they believe not"
  84,21,and when the Koran is recited to them they do not bow
  84,22,"Nay, but the unbelievers are crying lies"
  84,23,and God knows very well what they are secreting
  84,24,So give them good tidings of a painful chastisement
  84,25,"except those that believe, and do righteous deeds -- theirs shall be a wage unfailing"
