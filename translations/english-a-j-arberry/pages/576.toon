quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,"Lo! He reflected, and determined"
  74,19,"death seize him, how he determined"
  74,20,"Again, death seize him, how he determined"
  74,21,Then he beheld
  74,22,"then he frowned, and scowled"
  74,23,"then he retreated, and waxed proud"
  74,24,"He said, 'This is naught but a trumped-up sorcery"
  74,25,this is nothing but mortal speech
  74,26,I shall surely roast him in Sakar
  74,27,and what will teach thee what is Sakar
  74,28,"It spares not, neither leaves alone"
  74,29,scorching the flesh
  74,30,over it are nineteen
  74,31,"We have appointed only angels to be masters of the Fire, and their number We have appointed only as a trial for the unbelievers, that those who were given the Book may have certainty, and that those who believe may increase in belief, and that those who were given the Book and those who believe may not be in-doubt, and that those in whose hearts there is sickness, and the unbelievers, may say, 'What did God intend by this as a similitude?' So God leads astray whomsoever He will, and He guides whomsoever He will; and none knows the hosts of thy Lord but He. And it is naught but a Reminder to mortals"
  74,32,Nay! By the moon
  74,33,and the night when it retreats
  74,34,and the dawn when it is white
  74,35,surely it is one of the greatest things
  74,36,as a warner to mortals
  74,37,to whoever of you desires to go forward or lag behind
  74,38,Every soul shall be pledged for what it has earned
  74,39,save the Companions of the Right
  74,40,in Gardens they will question
  74,41,concerning the sinners
  74,42,What thrusted you into Sakar
  74,43,"They shall say, 'We were not of those who prayed, and"
  74,44,we fed not the needy
  74,45,and we plunged along with the plungers
  74,46,and we cried lies to the Day of Doom
  74,47,till the Certain came to us
