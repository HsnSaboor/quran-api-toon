quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,therefore he today has not here one loyal friend
  69,36,neither any food saving foul pus
  69,37,that none excepting the sinners eat
  69,38,No! I swear by that you see
  69,39,and by that you do not see
  69,40,it is the speech of a noble Messenger
  69,41,It is not the speech of a poet (little do you believe)
  69,42,nor the speech of a soothsayer (little do you remember)
  69,43,A sending down from the Lord of all Being
  69,44,Had he invented against Us any sayings
  69,45,We would have seized him by the right hand
  69,46,then We would surely have cut his life-vein
  69,47,and not one of you could have defended him
  69,48,Surely it is a Reminder to the godfearing
  69,49,but We know that some of you will cry lies
  69,50,Surely it is a sorrow to the unbelievers
  69,51,yet indeed it is the truth of certainty
  69,52,"Then magnify the Name of thy Lord, the All-mighty"
  70,1,A questioner asked of a chastisement about to fall
  70,2,"for the unbelievers, which none may avert"
  70,3,"from God, the Lord of the Stairways"
  70,4,"To Him the angels and the Spirit mount up, in a day whereof the measure is fifty thousand years"
  70,5,So be thou patient with a sweet patience
  70,6,"behold, they see it as if far off"
  70,7,but We see it is nigh
  70,8,Upon the day when heaven shall be as molten copper
  70,9,and the mountains shall be as plucked wool-tufts
  70,10,no loyal friend shall question loyal friend
