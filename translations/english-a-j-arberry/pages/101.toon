  4,141,"Those who wait upon you and, if a victory comes to you from God, say, 'Were we not with you?' but if the unbelievers get a share, they say, 'Did we not gain the mastery over you, and did we not defend you from the believers?' God will judge between you on the Resurrection Day, and God will not grant the unbelievers any way over the believers"
  4,142,"The hypocrites seek to trick God, but God is tricking them. When they stand up to pray they stand up lazily, showing off to the people and not remembering God save a little"
  4,143,"wavering all the time -- not to these, not to those; and whom God leads astray, thou wilt not find for him a way"
  4,144,"O believers, take not the unbelievers as friends instead of the believers; or do you desire to give God over you a clear authority"
  4,145,Surely the hypocrites will be in the lowest reach of the Fire; thou wilt not find for them any helper
