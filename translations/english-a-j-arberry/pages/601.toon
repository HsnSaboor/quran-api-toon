quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By the afternoon
  103,2,Surely Man is in the way of loss
  103,3,"save those who believe, and do righteous deeds, and counsel each other unto the truth, and counsel each other to be steadfast"
  104,1,"Woe unto every backbiter, slanderer"
  104,2,who has gathered riches and counted them over
  104,3,thinking his riches have made him immortal
  104,4,No indeed; he shall be thrust into the Crusher
  104,5,and what shall teach thee what is the Crusher
  104,6,The Fire of God kindled
  104,7,roaring over the hearts
  104,8,covered down upon them
  104,9,in columns outstretched
  105,1,Hast thou not seen how thy Lord did with the Men of the Elephant
  105,2,Did He not make their guile to go astray
  105,3,And He loosed upon them birds in flights
  105,4,hurling against them stones of baked clay
  105,5,and He made them like green blades devoured
