quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,"Our commandment is but one word, as the twinkling of an eye"
  54,51,We have destroyed the likes of you; is there any that will remember
  54,52,Every thing that they have done is in the Scrolls
  54,53,"and everything, great and small, is inscribed"
  54,54,Surely the godfearing shall dwell amid gardens and a river
  54,55,"in a sure abode, in the presence of a King Omnipotent"
  55,1,The All-merciful
  55,2,has taught the Koran
  55,3,He created man
  55,4,and He has taught him the Explanation
  55,5,The sun and the moon to a reckoning
  55,6,and the stars and the trees bow themselves
  55,7,"and heaven -- He raised it up, and set the Balance"
  55,8,Transgress not in the Balance
  55,9,"and weigh with justice, and skimp not in the Balance"
  55,10,And earth -- He set it down for all beings
  55,11,"therein fruits, and palm-trees with sheaths"
  55,12,"and grain in the blade, and fragrant herbs"
  55,13,O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny
  55,14,He created man of a clay like the potter's
  55,15,and He created the jinn of a smokeless fire
  55,16,O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny
