quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,"It is not for any believer, man or woman, when God and His Messenger have decreed a matter, to have the choice in the affair. Whosoever disobeys God and His Messenger has gone astray into manifest error"
  33,37,"When thou saidst to him whom God had blessed and thou hadst favoured, 'Keep thy wife to thyself, and fear God,' and thou wast concealing within thyself what God should reveal, fearing other men; and God has better right for thee to fear Him. So when Zaid had accomplished what he would of her, then We gave her in marriage to thee, so that there should not be any fault in the believers, touching the wives of their adopted sons, when they have accomplished what they would of them; and God's commandment must be performed"
  33,38,"There is no fault in the Prophet, touching what God has ordained for him -- God's wont with those who passed away before; and God's commandment is doom decreed"
  33,39,"who were delivering the Messages of God, and were fearing Him, and fearing not any one except Him; and God suffices as a reckoner"
  33,40,"Muhammad is not the father of any one of your men, but the Messenger of God, and the Seal of the Prophets; God has knowledge of everything"

  33,42,and give Him glory at the dawn and in the evening
  33,43,"It is He who blesses you, and His angels, to bring you forth from the shadows into the light. He is All-compassionate to the believers"
