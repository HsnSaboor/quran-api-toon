quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,No indeed; but you love the hasty world
  75,21,and leave be the Hereafter
  75,22,Upon that day faces shall be radiant
  75,23,gazing upon their Lord
  75,24,and upon that day faces shall be scowling
  75,25,thou mightest think the Calamity has been wreaked on them
  75,26,No indeed; when it reaches the clavicles
  75,27,"and it is said, 'Who is an enchanter"
  75,28,and he thinks that it is the parting
  75,29,and leg is intertwined with leg
  75,30,upon that day unto thy Lord shall be the driving
  75,31,"For he confirmed it not, and did not pray"
  75,32,"but he cried it lies, and he turned away"
  75,33,then he went to his household arrogantly
  75,34,Nearer to thee and nearer
  75,35,then nearer to thee and nearer
  75,36,"What, does man reckon he shall be left to roam at will"
  75,37,Was he not a sperm-drop spilled
  75,38,"Then he was a blood-clot, and He created and formed"
  75,39,"and He made of him two kinds, male and female"
  75,40,"What, is He not able to quicken the dead"
  76,1,Has there come on man a while of time when he was a thing unremembered
  76,2,"We created man of a sperm-drop, a mingling, and We made him hearing, seeing"
  76,3,Surely We guided him upon the way whether he be thankful or unthankful
  76,4,"Surely We have prepared for the unbelievers chains, fetters, and a Blaze"
  76,5,Surely the pious shall drink of a cup whose mixture is camphor
