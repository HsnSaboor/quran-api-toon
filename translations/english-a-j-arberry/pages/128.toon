quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,1,Praise belongs to God who created the heavens and the earth and appointed the shadows and light; then the unbelievers ascribe equals to their Lord

  6,3,"He is God in the heavens and the earth; He knows your secrets, and what you publish, and He knows what you are earning"
  6,4,"Not a sign of their Lord comes to them, but they turn away from it"
  6,5,"They cried lies to the truth when it came to them, but there shall come to them news of that they were mocking"
  6,6,"Have they not regarded how We destroyed before them many a generation We established in the earth, as We never established you, and how We loosed heaven upon them in torrents, and made the rivers to flow beneath them? Then We destroyed them because of their sins, and raised up after them another generation"
  6,7,"Had We sent down on thee a Book on parchment and so they touched it with their hands, yet the unbelievers would have said, 'This is naught but manifest sorcery"
  6,8,"Why has an angel not been sent down on him?' they say; yet had We sent down an angel, the matter would have been determined, and then no respite would be given them"
