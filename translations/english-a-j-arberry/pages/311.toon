quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Hast thou seen him who disbelieves in Our signs and says, 'Assuredly I shall be given wealth and children"
  19,78,"What, has he observed the Unseen, or taken a covenant with the All-merciful"
  19,79,"No, indeed! We shall assuredly write down all that he says, and We shall prolong for him the chastisement"
  19,80,"and We shall inherit from him that he says, and he shall come to Us alone"
  19,81,"And they have taken to them other gods apart from God, that they might be for them a might"
  19,82,"No, indeed! They shall deny their service, and they shall be against them pitted"
  19,83,"Hast thou not seen how We sent the Satans against the unbelievers, to prick them"
  19,84,So hasten thou not against them; We are only numbering for them a number
  19,85,On the day that We shall muster the godfearing to the All-merciful with pomp
  19,86,and drive the evildoers into Gehenna herding
  19,87,"having no power of intercession, save those who have taken with the All-merciful covenant"
  19,88,"And they say, 'The All-merciful has taken unto Himself a son"
  19,89,You have indeed advanced something hideous
  19,90,"The heavens are wellnigh rent of it and the earth split asunder, and the mountains wellnigh fall down crashing for"
  19,91,that they have attributed to the All-merciful a son
  19,92,and it behoves not the All-merciful to take a son
  19,93,None is there in the heavens and earth but he comes to the All-merciful as a servant
  19,94,"He has indeed counted them, and He has numbered them exactly"
  19,95,"Every one of them shall come to Him upon the Day of Resurrection, all alone"
