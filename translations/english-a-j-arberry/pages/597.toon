quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the fig and the olive
  95,2,and the Mount Sinai
  95,3,and this land secure
  95,4,We indeed created Man in the fairest stature
  95,5,then We restored him the lowest of the low
  95,6,"save those who believe, and do righteous deeds; they shall have a wage unfailing"
  95,7,What then shall cry thee lies as to the Doom
  95,8,Is not God the justest of judges
  96,1,"Recite: In the Name of thy Lord who created"
  96,2,created Man of a blood-clot
  96,3,"Recite: And thy Lord is the Most Generous"
  96,4,who taught by the Pen
  96,5,taught Man that he knew not
  96,6,No indeed; surely Man waxes insolent
  96,7,for he thinks himself self-sufficient
  96,8,Surely unto thy Lord is the Returning
  96,9,What thinkest thou? He who forbids
  96,10,a servant when he prays
  96,11,What thinkest thou? If he were upon guidance
  96,12,or bade to godfearing
  96,13,"What thinkest thou? If he cries lies, and turns away"
  96,14,Did he not know that God sees
  96,15,"No indeed; surely, if he gives not over, We shall seize him by the forelock"
  96,16,"a lying, sinful forelock"
  96,17,So let him call on his concourse
  96,18,We shall call on the guards of Hell
  96,19,"No indeed; do thou not obey him, and bow thyself, and draw nigh"
