quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,43,"no nation outstrips its term, nor do they put it back"
  23,44,"Then sent We Our Messengers successively; whenever its Messenger came to a nation they cried him lies, so We caused some of them to follow others, and We made them as but tales; so away with a people who do not believe"
  23,45,Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and a manifest authority
  23,46,"unto Pharaoh and his Council; but they waxed proud, and they were a lofty people"
  23,47,"and they said, 'What, shall we believe two mortals like ourselves, whose people are our servants"
  23,48,"So they cried them lies, and they were among the destroyed"
  23,49,"And We gave Moses the Book, that haply they would be guided"
  23,50,"and We made Mary's son, and his mother, to be a sign, and gave them refuge upon a height, where was a hollow and a spring"
  23,51,"O Messengers, eat of the good things and do righteousness; surely I know the things you do"
  23,52,"Surely this community of yours is one community, and I am your Lord; so fear Me"
  23,53,"But they split in their affair between them into sects, each party rejoicing in what is with them"
  23,54,So leave thou them in their perplexity for a time
  23,55,"What, do they think that We succour them with of wealth and children"
  23,56,"We vie in good works for them? Nay, but they are not aware"
  23,57,Surely those who tremble in fear of their Lord
  23,58,and those who believe in the signs of their Lord
  23,59,and those who associate naught with their Lord
