  34,32,"Those that waxed proud will say to those that were abased, 'What, did we bar you from the guidance after it came to you? Nay, rather you were sinners"
  34,33,"And those that were abased will say to those that waxed proud, 'Nay, but devising night and day, when you were ordering us to disbelieve in God, and to set up compeers to Him.' They will be secretly remorseful when they see the chastisement and We put fetters on the necks of the unbelievers; shall they be recompensed except for what they were doing"
  34,34,"We sent no warner into any city except its men who lived at ease said, 'We disbelieve in the Message you have been sent with"

  34,36,"Say: 'My Lord outspreads and straitens His provision to whomsoever He will, but most men do not know it"

  34,38,And those who strive against Our signs to void them -- those shall be arraigned into the chastisement
  34,39,"Say: 'My Lord outspreads and straitens His provision to whomsoever He will of His servants; and whatever thing you shall expend, He will replace it. He is the best of providers"
