quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the Star when it plunges
  53,2,"your comrade is not astray, neither errs"
  53,3,nor speaks he out of caprice
  53,4,This is naught but a revelation revealed
  53,5,taught him by one terrible in power
  53,6,very strong; he stood poised
  53,7,being on the higher horizon
  53,8,then drew near and suspended hung
  53,9,"two bows' length away, or nearer"
  53,10,then revealed to his servant that he revealed
  53,11,His heart lies not of what he saw
  53,12,"what, will you dispute with him what he sees"
  53,13,"Indeed, he saw him another time"
  53,14,by the Lote-Tree of the Boundary
  53,15,nigh which is the Garden of the Refuge
  53,16,when there covered the Lote-Tree that which covered
  53,17,his eye swerved not; nor swept astray
  53,18,"Indeed, he saw one of the greatest signs of his Lord"
  53,19,Have you considered El-Lat and El-'Uzza
  53,20,"and Manat the third, the other"
  53,21,"What, have you males, and He females"
  53,22,That were indeed an unjust division
  53,23,"They are naught but names yourselves have named, and your fathers; God has sent down no authority touching them. They follow only surmise, and what the souls desire; and yet guidance has come to them from their Lord"
  53,24,Or shall man have whatever he fancies
  53,25,And to God belongs the First and the Last
  53,26,"How many an angel there is in the heavens whose intercession avails not anything, save after that God gives leave to whomsoever He wills and is well-pleased"
