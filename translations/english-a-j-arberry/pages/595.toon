quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and his morning brightness
  91,2,and by the moon when she follows him
  91,3,and by the day when it displays him
  91,4,and by the night when it enshrouds him
  91,5,By the heaven and That which built it
  91,6,and by the earth and That which extended it
  91,7,"By the soul, and That which shaped it"
  91,8,and inspired it to lewdness and godfearing
  91,9,Prosperous is he who purifies it
  91,10,and failed has he who seduces it
  91,11,Thamood cried lies in their insolence
  91,12,when the most wretched of them uprose
  91,13,"then the Messenger of God said to them, 'The She-camel of God; let her drink"
  91,14,"But they cried him lies, and hamstrung her, so their Lord crushed them for their sin, and leveled them"
  91,15,and He fears not the issue thereof
  92,1,By the night enshrouding
  92,2,and the day in splendour
  92,3,and That which created the male and the female
  92,4,surely your striving is to diverse ends
  92,5,As for him who gives and is godfearing
  92,6,and confirms the reward most fair
  92,7,We shall surely ease him to the Easing
  92,8,"But as for him who is a miser, and self-sufficient"
  92,9,and cries lies to the reward most fair
  92,10,We shall surely ease him to the Hardship
  92,11,his wealth shall not avail him when he perishes
  92,12,Surely upon Us rests the guidance
  92,13,and to Us belong the Last and the First
  92,14,Now I have warned you of a Fire that flames
