quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,Those who do not believe in the world to come name the angels with the names of females
  53,28,"They have not any knowledge thereof; they follow only surmise, and surmise avails naught against truth"
  53,29,"So turn thou from him who turns away from Our Remembrance, and desires only the present life"
  53,30,"That is their attainment of knowledge. Surely thy Lord knows very well those who have gone astray from His way, and He knows very well those who are guided"
  53,31,"To God belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, that He may recompense those who do evil for what they have done, and recompense those who have done good with the reward most fair"
  53,32,"Those who avoid the heinous sins and indecencies, save lesser offences surely thy Lord is wide in His forgiveness. Very well He knows you, when He produced you from the earth, and when you were yet unborn in your mothers' wombs; therefore hold not yourselves purified; God knows very well him who is godfearing"
  53,33,Hast thou considered him who turns his back
  53,34,"and gives a little, and then grudgingly"
  53,35,"Does he possess the knowledge of the Unseen, and therefore he sees"
  53,36,Or has he not been told of what is in the scrolls of Moses
  53,37,"and Abraham, he who paid his debt in full"
  53,38,That no soul laden bears the load of another
  53,39,and that a man shall have to his account only as he has laboured
  53,40,and that his labouring shall surely be seen
  53,41,then he shall be recompensed for it with the fullest recompense
  53,42,and that the final end is unto thy Lord
  53,43,"and that it is He who makes to laugh, and that makes to weep"
  53,44,"and that it is He who makes to die, and that makes to live"
