quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  48,16,"Say to the Bedouins who were left behind: 'You shall be called against a people possessed of great might' to fight them, or they surrender. If you obey, God will give you a goodly wage; but if you turn your backs, as you turned your backs before, He will chastise you with a painful chastisement"
  48,17,"There is no fault in the blind, and there is no fault in the lame, and there is no fault in the sick. And whosoever obeys God and His Messenger, He will admit him into gardens underneath which rivers flow; but whosoever turns his back, him He will chastise with a painful chastisement"
  48,18,"God was well pleased with the believers when they were swearing fealty to thee under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down the Shechina upon them, and rewarded them with a nigh victory"
  48,19,"and many spoils to take; and God is ever All-mighty, All-wise"
  48,20,"God has promised you many spoils to take; these He has hastened to you, and has restrained the hands of men from you, and that it may be a sign to the believers, and to guide you on a straight path"
  48,21,and other spoils you were not able to take; God had encompassed them already. God is powerful over everything
  48,22,"If the unbelievers had fought you, they would have turned their backs, and then found neither protector nor helper"
  48,23,"the wont of God, as in the past before, and thou shalt never find any changing the wont of God"
