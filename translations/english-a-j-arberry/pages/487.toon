  42,32,And of His signs are the ships that run on the sea like landmarks
  42,33,"and if He wills, He stills the wind, and they remain motionless on its back. Surely in that are signs for every man enduring, thankful"
  42,34,Or He wrecks them for what they have earned; and He pardons much

  42,37,And those who avoid the heinous sins and indecencies and when they are angry forgive
  42,38,"and those who answer their Lord, and perform the prayer, their affair being counsel between them, and they expend of that We have provided them"
  42,39,"and who, when insolence visits them, do help themselves"
  42,40,"and the recompense of evil is evil the like of it; but whoso pardons and puts things right, his wage falls upon God; surely He loves not the evildoers"

  42,43,But surely he who bears patiently and is forgiving -- surely that is true constancy
  42,44,"Whomsoever God leads astray, he has no protector after him; and thou shalt see the evildoers, when they see the chastisement, saying, 'Is there any way to be sent back"
