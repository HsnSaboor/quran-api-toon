quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"who would say, \"Are you a confirmer"
  37,53,"What, when we are dead and become dust and bones, shall we indeed be requited"
  37,54,"He says, 'Are you looking down"
  37,55,"Then he looks, and sees him in the midst of Hell"
  37,56,"He says, 'By God, wellnigh thou didst destroy me"
  37,57,"But for my Lord's blessing, I were one of the arraigned"
  37,58,"What, do we then not die"
  37,59,"except for our first death, and are we not chastised"
  37,60,This is indeed the mighty triumph
  37,61,for the like of this let the workers work
  37,62,"Is that better as a hospitality, or the Tree of Ez-Zakkoum"
  37,63,We have appointed it as a trial for the evildoers
  37,64,It is a tree that comes forth in the root of Hell
  37,65,its spathes are as the heads of Satans
  37,66,"and they eat of it, and of it fill their bellies"
  37,67,then on top of it they have a brew of boiling water
  37,68,then their return is unto Hell
  37,69,They found their fathers erring
  37,70,and they run in their footsteps
  37,71,Before them erred most of the ancients
  37,72,and We sent among them warners
  37,73,"and behold, how was the end of them that were warned"
  37,74,except for God's sincere servants
  37,75,Noah called to Us; and how excellent were the Answerers
  37,76,And We delivered him and his people from the great distress
