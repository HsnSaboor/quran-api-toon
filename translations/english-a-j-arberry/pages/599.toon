quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  98,8,"their recompense is with their Lord-Gardens of Eden, underneath which rivers flow, therein dwelling for ever and ever. God is well-pleased with them, and they are well-pleased with Him; that is for him who fears his Lord"
  99,1,When earth is shaken with a mighty shaking
  99,2,and earth brings forth her burdens
  99,3,"and Man says., 'What ails her"
  99,4,upon that day she shall tell her tidings
  99,5,for that her Lord has inspired her
  99,6,Upon that day men shall issue in scatterings to see their works
  99,7,and whoso has done an atom's weight of good shall see it
  99,8,and whoso has done an atom's weight of evil shall see it
  100,1,By the snorting chargers
  100,2,by the strikers of fire
  100,3,by the dawn-raiders
  100,4,blazing a trail of dust
  100,5,cleaving there with a host
  100,6,Surely Man is ungrateful to his Lord
  100,7,and surely he is a witness against that
  100,8,Surely he is passionate in his love for good things
  100,9,Knows he not that when that which is in the tombs is over-thrown
