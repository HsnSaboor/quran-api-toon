quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When heaven is split open
  82,2,when the stars are scattered
  82,3,when the seas swarm over
  82,4,when the tombs are overthrown
  82,5,"then a soul shall know its works, the former and the latter"
  82,6,O Man! What deceived thee as to thy generous Lord
  82,7,who created thee and shaped thee and wrought thee in symmetry
  82,8,and composed thee after what form He would
  82,9,No indeed; but you cry lies to the Doom
  82,10,yet there are over you watchers
  82,11,"noble, writers"
  82,12,who know whatever you do
  82,13,Surely the pious shall be in bliss
  82,14,and the libertines shall be in a fiery furnace
  82,15,roasting therein on the Day of Doom
  82,16,nor shall they ever be absent from it
  82,17,And what shall teach thee what is the Day of Doom
  82,18,"Again, what shall teach thee what is the Day of Doom"
  82,19,A day when no soul shall possess aught to succour another soul; that day the Command shall belong unto God
  83,1,Woe to the stinters who
  83,2,"when they measure against the people, take full measure"
  83,3,"but, when they measure for them or weigh for them, do skimp"
  83,4,Do those not think that they shall be raised up
  83,5,unto a mighty day
  83,6,a day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of all Being
