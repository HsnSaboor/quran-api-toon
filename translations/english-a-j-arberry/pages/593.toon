quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the dawn
  89,2,and ten nights
  89,3,by the even and the odd
  89,4,by the night when it journeys on
  89,5,Is there in that an oath for a mindful man
  89,6,Hast thou not seen how thy Lord did with Ad
  89,7,Iram of the pillars
  89,8,the like of which was never created in the land
  89,9,"and Thamood, who hollowed the rocks in the valley"
  89,10,"and Pharaoh, he of the tent-pegs"
  89,11,who all were insolent in the land
  89,12,and worked much corruption therein
  89,13,Thy Lord unloosed on them a scourge of chastisement
  89,14,surely thy Lord is ever on the watch
  89,15,"As for man, whenever his Lord tries him, and honours him, and blesses him, then he says, 'My Lord has honoured me"
  89,16,"But when he tries him and stints for him his provision, then he says, 'My Lord has despised me"
  89,17,No indeed; but you honour not the orphan
  89,18,and you urge not the feeding of the needy
  89,19,and you devour the inheritance greedily
  89,20,and you love wealth with an ardent love
  89,21,No indeed! When the earth is ground to powder
  89,22,"and thy Lord comes, and the angels rank on rank"
  89,23,"and Gehenna is brought out, upon that day man will remember; and how shall the Reminder be for him"
