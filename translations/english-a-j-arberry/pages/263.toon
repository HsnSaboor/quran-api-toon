quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  15,16,We have set in heaven constellations and decked them out fair to the beholders
  15,17,and guarded them from every accursed Satan
  15,18,excepting such as listens by stealth -- and he is pursued by a manifest flame
  15,19,"And the earth -- We stretched it forth, and cast on it firm mountains, and We caused to grow therein of every thing justly weighed"
  15,20,"and there appointed for you livelihood, and for those you provide not for"
  15,21,"Naught is there, but its treasuries are with Us, and We send it not down but in a known measure"
  15,22,"And We loose the winds fertilising, and We send down out of heaven water, then We give it to you to drink, and you are not its treasurers"
  15,23,"It is We who give life, and make to die, and it is We who are the inheritors"
  15,24,"We know the ones of you who press forward, and We know the laggards"
  15,25,"and it is thy Lord shall muster them, and He is All-wise, All-knowing"
  15,26,Surely We created man of a clay of mud moulded
  15,27,and the jinn created We before of fire flaming
  15,28,"And when thy Lord said to the angels, 'See, I am creating a mortal of a clay of mud moulded"
  15,29,"When I have shaped him, and breathed My spirit in him, fall you down, bowing before him"
  15,30,Then the angels bowed themselves all together
  15,31,save Iblis; he refused to be among those bowing
