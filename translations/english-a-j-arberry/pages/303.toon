quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  18,84,"We established him in the land, and We gave him a way to everything"
  18,85,and he followed a way
  18,86,"until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a muddy spring, and he found nearby a people. We said, 'O Dhool Karnain, either thou shalt chastise them, or thou shalt take towards them a way of kindness"
  18,87,"He said, 'As for the evildoer, him we shall chastise, then he shall be returned to his Lord and He shall chastise him with a horrible chastisement"
  18,88,"But as for him who believes, and does righteousness, he shall receive as recompense the reward most fair, and we shall speak to him, of our command, easiness"
  18,89,Then he followed a way
  18,90,"until, when he reached the rising of the sun, he found it rising upon a people for whom We had not appointed any veil to shade them from it"
  18,91,So; and We encompassed in knowledge what was with him
  18,92,Then he followed a way
  18,93,"until, when he reached between the two barriers, he found this side of them a people scarcely able to understand speech"
  18,94,"They said, 'O Dhool Karnain, behold, Gog and Magog are doing corruption in the earth; so shall we assign to thee a tribute, against thy setting up a barrier between us and between them"
  18,95,"He said, 'That wherein my Lord has established me is better; so aid me forcefully, and I will set up a rampart between you and between them"
  18,96,"Bring me ingots of iron!' Until, when he had made all level between the two cliffs, he said, 'Blow!' Until, when he had made it a fire, he said, 'Bring me, that I may pour molten brass on it"
  18,97,So they were unable either to scale it or pierce it
