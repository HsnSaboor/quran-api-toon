quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,Surely for the godfearing awaits a place of security
  78,32,gardens and vineyards
  78,33,"and maidens with swelling breasts, like of age"
  78,34,and a cup overflowing
  78,35,"Therein they shall hear no idle talk, no cry of lies"
  78,36,"for a recompense from thy Lord, a gift, a reckoning"
  78,37,"Lord of the heavens and earth, and all that between them is, the All-merciful of whom they have no power to speak"
  78,38,"Upon the day when the Spirit and the angels stand in ranks they shall speak not, save him to whom the All-merciful has given leave, and who speaks aright"
  78,39,That is the true day; so whosoever wills takes unto his Lord a resort
  78,40,"Lo, We have warned you of a nigh chastisement, upon the day when a man shall behold what his hands have forwarded, and the unbeliever shall say, 'O would that I were dust"
  79,1,By those that pluck out vehemently
  79,2,and those that draw out violently
  79,3,by those that swim serenely
  79,4,and those that outstrip suddenly
  79,5,by those that direct an affair
  79,6,Upon the day when the first blast shivers
  79,7,and the second blast follows it
  79,8,hearts upon that day shall be athrob
  79,9,and their eyes shall be humbled
  79,10,"They shall say, 'What, are we being restored as we were before"
  79,11,"What, when we are bones old and wasted"
  79,12,"They shall say, 'That then were a losing return"
  79,13,But it shall be only a single scare
  79,14,"and behold, they are awakened"
  79,15,Hast thou received the story of Moses
