quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,Prosperous are the believers
  23,2,who in their prayers are humble
  23,3,and from idle talk turn away
  23,4,and at almsgiving are active
  23,5,and guard their private parts
  23,6,save from their wives and what their right hands own then being not blameworthy
  23,7,"but whosoever seeks after more than that, those are the transgressors"
  23,8,and who preserve their trusts and their covenant
  23,9,and who observe their prayers
  23,10,Those are the inheritors
  23,11,who shall inherit Paradise therein dwelling forever
  23,12,We created man of an extraction of clay
  23,13,"then We set him, a drop, in a receptacle secure"
  23,14,"then We created of the drop a clot then We created of the clot a tissue then We created of the tissue bones then We garmented the bones in flesh; thereafter We produced him as another creature. So blessed be God, the fairest of creators"
  23,15,Then after that you shall surely die
  23,16,then on the Day of Resurrection you shall surely be raised up
  23,17,"And We created above you seven ways, and We were not heedless of creation"
