  55,69,O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny
  55,70,therein maidens good and comely
  55,71,O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny
  55,72,"houris, cloistered in cool pavilions"
  55,73,O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny
  55,74,untouched before them by any man or jinn
  55,75,O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny
  55,76,reclining upon green cushions and lovely druggets
  55,77,O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny

  56,5,and the mountains crumbled
  56,6,"and become a dust, scattered"
  56,7,and you shall be three bands

  56,9,Companions of the Left (O Companions of the Left)
  56,10,"and the Outstrippers: the Outstrippers"
  56,11,those are they brought nigh the Throne
  56,12,in the Gardens of Delight
  56,13,a throng of the ancients
  56,14,and how few of the later folk
  56,15,upon close-wrought couches
  56,16,"reclining upon them, set face to face"
