quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,"When his Lord called to him in the holy valley, Towa"
  79,17,Go to Pharaoh; he has waxed insolent
  79,18,"And say, \"Hast thou the will to purify thyself"
  79,19,"and that I should guide thee to thy Lord, then thou shalt fear"
  79,20,So he showed him the great sign
  79,21,"but he cried lies, and rebelled"
  79,22,then he turned away hastily
  79,23,then he mustered
  79,24,"and proclaimed, and he said, 'I am your Lord, the Most High"
  79,25,So God seized him with the chastisement of the Last World and the First
  79,26,Surely in that is a lesson for him who fears
  79,27,"What, are you stronger in constitution or the heaven He built"
  79,28,"He lifted up its vault, and levelled it"
  79,29,"and darkened its night, and brought forth its forenoon"
  79,30,and the earth-after that He spread it out
  79,31,therefrom brought forth its waters and its pastures
  79,32,and the mountains He set firm
  79,33,an enjoyment for you and your flocks
  79,34,"Then, when the Great Catastrophe comes"
  79,35,upon the day when man shall remember what he has striven
  79,36,and Hell is advanced for whoever sees
  79,37,then as for him who was insolent
  79,38,and preferred the present life
  79,39,surely Hell shall be the refuge
  79,40,But as for him who feared the Station of his Lord and forbade the soul its caprice
  79,41,surely Paradise shall be the refuge
  79,42,"They will question thee concerning the Hour, when it shall berth"
  79,43,"What art thou about, to mention it"
  79,44,Unto thy Lord is the final end of it
  79,45,Thou art only the warner of him who fears it
  79,46,"It shall be as if; on the day they see it, they have but tarried for an evening, or its forenoon"
