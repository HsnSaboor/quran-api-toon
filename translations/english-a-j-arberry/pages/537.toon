quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,it is surely a noble Koran
  56,78,in a hidden Book
  56,79,none but the purified shall touch
  56,80,a sending down from the Lord of all Being
  56,81,"What, do you hold this discourse in disdain"
  56,82,and do you make it your living to cry lies
  56,83,"Why, but when the soul leaps to the throat of the dying"
  56,84,and that hour you are watching
  56,85,"And We are nigher him than you, but you do not see Us"
  56,86,"why, if you are not at Our disposal"
  56,87,"do you not bring back his soul, if you speak truly"
  56,88,"Then, if he be of those brought nigh the Throne"
  56,89,"there shall be repose and ease, and a Garden of Delight"
  56,90,and if he be a Companion of the Right
  56,91,"Peace be upon thee, Companion of the Right"
  56,92,"But if he be of them that cried lies, and went astray"
  56,93,there shall be a hospitality of boiling water
  56,94,and the roasting in Hell
  56,95,Surely this is the truth of certainty
  56,96,"Then magnify the Name of thy Lord, the All-mighty"
  57,1,"All that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies God; He is the All-mighty, the All-wise"
  57,2,"To Him belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He gives life, and He makes to die, and He is powerful over everything"
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last, the Outward and the Inward; He has knowledge of everything"
