quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  35,19,Not equal are the blind and the seeing man
  35,20,the shadows and the light
  35,21,the shade and the torrid heat
  35,22,not equal are the living and the dead. God makes to hear whomsoever He will; thou canst not make those in their tombs to hear
  35,23,thou art naught but a warner
  35,24,"Surely We have sent thee with the truth good tidings to bear, and warning; not a nation there is, but there has passed away in it a warner"
  35,25,"If they cry thee lies, those before them also cried lies; their Messengers came to them with the clear signs, the Psalms, the Illuminating Book"
  35,26,"then I seized the unbelievers, and how was My horror"
  35,27,"Hast thou not seen how that God sends down out of heaven water, and therewith We bring forth fruits of diverse hues? And in the mountains are streaks white and red, of diverse hues, and pitchy black"
  35,28,"men too, and beasts and cattle -- diverse are their hues. Even so only those of His servants fear God who have knowledge; surely God is All-mighty, All-forgiving"
  35,29,"Surely those who recite the Book of God and perform the prayer, and expend of that We have provided them, secretly and in public, look for a commerce that comes not to naught"
  35,30,"that He may pay them in full their wages and enrich them of His bounty; surely He is All-forgiving, All-thankful"
