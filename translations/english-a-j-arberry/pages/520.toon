  50,40,"and proclaim thy Lord's praise in the night, and at the ends of the prostrations"
  50,41,And listen thou for the day when the caller shall call from a near place
  50,42,"On the day they hear the Cry in truth, that is the day of coming forth"
  50,43,"It is We who give life, and make to die, and to Us is the homecoming"

  50,45,We know very well what they say; thou art not a tyrant over them. Therefore remind by the Koran him who fears My threat

  51,2,and the burden-bearers
  51,3,and the smooth runners
  51,4,and the partitioners

  51,6,and surely the Doom is about to fall
