quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,"Nay, but you prefer the present life"
  87,17,"and the world to come is better, and more enduring"
  87,18,Surely this is in the ancient scrolls
  87,19,the scrolls of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Hast thou received the story of the Enveloper
  88,2,Faces on that day humbled
  88,3,"labouring, toilworn"
  88,4,roasting at a scorching fire
  88,5,watered at a boiling fountain
  88,6,no food for them but cactus thorn
  88,7,"unfattening, unappeasing hunger"
  88,8,Faces on that day jocund
  88,9,with their striving well-pleased
  88,10,in a sublime Garden
  88,11,hearing there no babble
  88,12,therein a running fountain
  88,13,therein uplifted couches
  88,14,and goblets set forth
  88,15,and cushions arrayed
  88,16,and carpets outspread
  88,17,"What, do they not consider how the camel was created"
  88,18,how heaven was lifted up
  88,19,how the mountains were hoisted
  88,20,how the earth was outstretched
  88,21,Then remind them! Thou art only a reminder
  88,22,thou art not charged to oversee them
  88,23,"But he who turns his back, and disbelieves"
  88,24,God shall chastise him with the greatest chastisement
  88,25,"Truly, to Us is their return"
  88,26,then upon Us shall rest their reckoning
