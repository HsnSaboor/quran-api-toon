  26,40,Haply we shall follow the sorcerers if it should be they are the victors
  26,41,"Then, when the sorcerers came, they said to Pharaoh, 'Shall we indeed have a wage, if we should be the victors"
  26,42,"He said, 'Yes indeed; and you shall then be among the near-stationed"
  26,43,"Moses said to them, 'Cast you down what you will cast"
  26,44,"So they cast their ropes and their staffs, and said, 'By the might of Pharaoh we shall be the victors"
  26,45,"Then Moses cast his staff and lo, it forthwith swallowed up their lying invention"
  26,46,"so the sorcerers were cast down, bowing themselves"
  26,47,"They said, 'We believe in the Lord of all Being"
  26,48,the Lord of Moses and Aaron
  26,49,"Said Pharaoh, 'You have believed him before I gave you leave. Why, he is the chief of you, the same that taught you sorcery; now you shall know! I shall assuredly cut off alternately your hands and feet, then I shall crucify you all together"
  26,50,"They said, 'There is no harm; surely unto our Lord we are turning"
  26,51,"We are eager that our Lord should forgive us our offences, for that we are the first of the believers"

  26,58,and treasures and a noble station
  26,59,"even so, and We bequeathed them upon the Children of Israel"
  26,60,Then they followed them at the sunrise
