quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,31,"as persons having pure faith in Allah, not ascribing partners to Him. Whoever ascribes partners to Allah is as though he had fallen from a height, then [his corpse] is devoured by vultures, or [his remains are] blown away by the wind far and wide"
  22,32,That. And whoever venerates the sacraments of Allah—indeed that arises from the Godwariness of hearts
  22,33,You may benefit from them until a specified time. Then their place of sacrifice is by the Ancient House
  22,34,"For every nation We have appointed a rite so that they might mention Allah’s Name over the livestock He has provided them. Your God is the One God, so submit to Him. And give good news to the humble"
  22,35,"—those whose hearts tremble with awe when Allah is mentioned, and who are patient through whatever visits them, and who maintain the prayer and spend out of what We have provided them"
  22,36,"We have appointed for you the [sacrificial] camels as part of Allah’s sacraments. There is good for you in them. So mention the Name of Allah over them as they stand. And when they have fallen on their flanks, eat from them, and feed the self-contained needy and the mendicant. Thus have We disposed them for your benefit so that you may give thanks"
  22,37,"It is not their flesh or blood that reaches Allah; rather, it is your piety that reaches Him. Thus has He disposed them for your benefit so that you may magnify Allah for His guiding you. And give good news to the virtuous"
  22,38,Allah will indeed defend those who have faith. Indeed Allah does not like any ingrate traitor
