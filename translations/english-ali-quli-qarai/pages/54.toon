quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,30,"The day when every soul will find present whatever good it has done; and as for the evil, it has done, it will wish there were a far distance between it and itself. Allah warns you to beware of [disobeying] Him, and Allah is most kind to [His] servants"
  3,31,"Say, ‘If you love Allah, then follow me; Allah will love you and forgive you your sins, and Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful.’"
  3,32,"Say, ‘Obey Allah and the Apostle.’ But if they turn away, indeed Allah does not like the faithless"
  3,33,"Indeed Allah chose Adam and Noah, and the progeny of Abraham and the progeny of Imran above all the nations"
  3,34,"some of them are descendants of the others, and Allah is all-hearing, all-knowing"
  3,35,"When the wife of Imran said, ‘My Lord, I dedicate to You in consecration what is in my belly. Accept it from me; indeed You are the All-hearing, the All-knowing.’"
  3,36,"When she bore her, she said, ‘My Lord, I have borne a female [child]’—and Allah knew better what she had borne, and the male [child she expected] was no match for the female [child she had borne] —‘and I have named her Mary, and I commend her and her offspring to Your care against [the evil of] the outcast Satan.’"
  3,37,"Thereupon her Lord accepted her with a gracious acceptance, and made her grow up in a worthy fashion, and He charged Zechariah with her care. Whenever Zechariah visited her in the sanctuary, he would find provisions with her. He said, ‘O Mary, from where does this come for you?’ She said, ‘It comes from Allah. Allah provides whomever He wishes without any reckoning.’"
