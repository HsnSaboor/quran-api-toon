quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"Those who are [themselves] faithless and bar [others] from the way of Allah—He has rendered their works fruitless"
  47,2,But those who have faith and do righteous deeds and believe in what has been sent down to Muhammad—and it is the truth from their Lord—He shall absolve them of their misdeeds and set right their affairs
  47,3,"That is because the faithless follow falsehood, and the faithful follow the truth from their Lord. That is how Allah draws comparisons for mankind"
  47,4,"When you meet the faithless in battle, strike their necks. When you have thoroughly decimated them, bind the captives firmly. Thereafter either oblige them [by setting them free] or take ransom, until the war lays down its burdens. That [is Allah’s ordinance]. Had Allah wished He could have taken vengeance on them, but that He may test some of you by means of others. As for those who were slain in the way of Allah, He will not let their works go fruitless"
  47,5,He will guide them and set right their affairs
  47,6,"and admit them into paradise, with which He has acquainted them"
  47,7,"O you who have faith! If you help Allah, He will help you and make your feet steady"
  47,8,"As for the faithless, their lot will be to fall [into ruin], and He will render their works fruitless"
  47,9,"That is because they loathed what Allah has sent down, so He made their works fail"
  47,10,"Have they not travelled through the land so that they may observe how was the fate of those who were before them? Allah destroyed them, and a similar [fate] awaits these faithless"
  47,11,"That is because Allah is the protector of the faithful, and because the faithless have no protector"
