quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,41,"O my people! [Think,] what makes me invite you to deliverance, while you invite me toward the Fire"
  40,42,"You invite me to defy Allah and to ascribe to Him partners of which I have no knowledge, while I call you to the All-mighty, the All-forgiver"
  40,43,"Undoubtedly, that to which you invite me has no invitation in the world nor in the Hereafter, and indeed our return will be to Allah, and indeed it is the transgressors who will be inmates of the Fire"
  40,44,"Soon you will remember what I tell you, and I entrust my affair to Allah. Indeed Allah watches His servants.’"
  40,45,"Then Allah saved him from their evil schemes, while a terrible punishment besieged Pharaoh’s clan"
  40,46,"the Fire, to which they are exposed morning and evening. On the day when the Hour sets in, Pharaoh’s clan will enter the severest punishment"
  40,47,"When they argue in the Fire, the oppressed will say to the oppressors, ‘We used to follow you; will you avail us against any portion of the Fire?’"
  40,48,"The oppressors will say, ‘We are all in it [together]; Allah has judged between [His] servants.’"
  40,49,"Those who are in the Fire will say to the keepers of hell, ‘Invoke your Lord to lighten for us [at least] a day’s punishment.’"
