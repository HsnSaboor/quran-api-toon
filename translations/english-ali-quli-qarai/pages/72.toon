quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,166,"What befell you on the day when the two hosts met, was by Allah’s permission, so that He may ascertain the faithful"
  3,167,"and ascertain the hypocrites. [When] they were told: ‘Come, fight in the way of Allah, or defend [yourselves], they said, ‘If we knew any fighting, we would have surely followed you.’ That day they were nearer to unfaith than to faith. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts, and Allah knows well whatever they conceal"
  3,168,"Those who said of their brethren, while they themselves sat back: ‘Had they obeyed us, they would not have been killed.’ Say, ‘Then keep death off from yourselves, if you are truthful.’"
  3,169,"Do not suppose those who were slain in the way of Allah to be dead; no, they are living and provided for near their Lord"
  3,170,"exulting in what Allah has given them out of His grace, and rejoicing for those who have not yet joined them from [those left] behind them, that they will have no fear, nor will they grieve"
  3,171,"They rejoice in Allah’s blessing and grace, and that Allah does not waste the reward of the faithful"
  3,172,"Those who responded to Allah and the Apostle [even] after they had been wounded—for those of them who have been virtuous and Godwary there shall be a great reward"
  3,173,"—Those to whom the people said, ‘All the people have gathered against you, so fear them.’ That only increased them in faith, and they said, ‘Allah is sufficient for us, and He is an excellent trustee.’"
