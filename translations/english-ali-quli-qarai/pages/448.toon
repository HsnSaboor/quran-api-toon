quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"who used to say, ‘‘Are you really among those who affirm"
  37,53,"that when we have died and become dust and bones, we shall be brought to retribution?’’ ’"
  37,54,"He will say, ‘Will you have a look?’"
  37,55,Then he will take a look and sight him in the middle of hell
  37,56,"He will say, ‘By Allah, you had almost ruined me"
  37,57,"Had it not been for my Lord’s blessing, I too would have been among those mustered [in hell]!’"
  37,58,"‘Is it [true] that we shall not die [anymore]"
  37,59,"aside from our earlier death, and that we shall not be punished"
  37,60,This is indeed the supreme triumph!’
  37,61,Let all workers work for the like of this
  37,62,"Is this a better reception, or the Zaqqum tree"
  37,63,Indeed We have made it a punishment for the wrongdoers
  37,64,It is a tree that rises from the depths of hell
  37,65,Its spathes are as if they were devils’ heads
  37,66,They will eat from it and gorge with it their bellies
  37,67,On top of that they will take a solution of scalding water
  37,68,Then their retreat will be toward hell
  37,69,They had found their fathers astray
  37,70,yet they press onwards in their footsteps
  37,71,Most of the former peoples went astray before them
  37,72,and We had certainly sent warners among them
  37,73,So observe how was the fate of those who were warned
  37,74,"—[all] except Allah’s exclusive servants"
  37,75,"Certainly Noah called out to Us, and how well did We respond"
  37,76,We delivered him and his family from their great distress
