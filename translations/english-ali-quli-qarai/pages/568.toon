quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,so he has no friend here today
  69,36,nor any food except pus
  69,37,which no one shall eat except the iniquitous.’
  69,38,I swear by what you see
  69,39,and what you do not see
  69,40,it is indeed the speech of a noble apostle
  69,41,and it is not the speech of a poet. Little is the faith that you have
  69,42,Nor is it the speech of a soothsayer. Little is the admonition that you take
  69,43,Gradually sent down from the Lord of all the worlds
  69,44,Had he faked any sayings in Our name
  69,45,We would have surely seized him by the right hand
  69,46,and then cut off his aorta
  69,47,and none of you could have held Us off from him
  69,48,Indeed it is a reminder for the Godwary
  69,49,"Indeed We know that there are some among you who deny [it]"
  69,50,"And indeed it will be a [matter of] regret for the faithless"
  69,51,It is indeed certain truth
  69,52,"So celebrate the Name of your Lord, the All-supreme"
  70,1,An asker asked for a punishment sure to befall
  70,2,—which none can avert from the faithless —
  70,3,"from Allah, Lord of the lofty stations"
  70,4,The angels and the Spirit ascend to Him in a day whose span is fifty thousand years
  70,5,"So be patient, with a patience that is graceful"
  70,6,Indeed they see it to be far off
  70,7,and We see it to be near
  70,8,The day when the sky will be like molten copper
  70,9,"and the mountains like [tufts of] dyed wool"
  70,10,"and no friend will inquire about [the welfare of his] friend"
