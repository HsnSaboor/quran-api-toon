quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,They will be waited upon by immortal youths
  56,18,with goblets and ewers and a cup of a clear wine
  56,19,which causes them neither headache nor stupefaction
  56,20,and such fruits as they prefer
  56,21,and such flesh of fowls as they desire
  56,22,and big-eyed houris
  56,23,like guarded pearls
  56,24,a reward for what they used to do
  56,25,They will not hear therein any vain talk or sinful speech
  56,26,"but only the watchword, ‘Peace!’ ‘Peace!’"
  56,27,And the People of the Right Hand—what are the People of the Right Hand
  56,28,Amid thornless lote trees
  56,29,and clustered spathes
  56,30,and extended shade
  56,31,and ever-flowing water
  56,32,and abundant fruits
  56,33,"neither inaccessible, nor forbidden"
  56,34,and noble spouses
  56,35,We have created them with a special creation
  56,36,and made them virgins
  56,37,"loving, of a like age"
  56,38,for the People of the Right Hand
  56,39,"A multitude from the former [generations]"
  56,40,"and a multitude from the latter [ones]"
  56,41,And the People of the Left Hand—what are the People of the Left Hand
  56,42,Amid infernal miasma and boiling water
  56,43,and the shadow of a dense black smoke
  56,44,neither cool nor beneficial
  56,45,Indeed they had been affluent before this
  56,46,and they used to persist in the great sin
  56,47,"And they used to say, ‘What! When we are dead and become dust and bones, shall we be resurrected"
  56,48,And our forefathers too?!’
  56,49,"Say, ‘Indeed the former and latter generations"
  56,50,will all be gathered for the tryst of a known day
