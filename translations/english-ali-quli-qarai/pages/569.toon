quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,"[though] they will be placed within each other’s sight. The guilty one will wish he could ransom himself from the punishment of that day at the price of his children"
  70,12,his spouse and his brother
  70,13,"his kin, which had sheltered him"
  70,14,"and all those who are upon the earth, if that might deliver him"
  70,15,"Never! Indeed, it is a blazing fire"
  70,16,which strips away the scalp
  70,17,"It invites him, who has turned back [from the truth] and forsaken [it]"
  70,18,"amassing [wealth] and hoarding [it]"
  70,19,Indeed man has been created covetous
  70,20,anxious when an ill befalls him
  70,21,"and grudging [charity] when good comes his way"
  70,22,"—[all are such] except the prayerful"
  70,23,those who persevere in their prayers
  70,24,and there is a known share in whose wealth
  70,25,for the beggar and the deprived
  70,26,and who affirm the Day of Retribution
  70,27,and those who are apprehensive of the punishment of their Lord
  70,28,there is indeed no security from the punishment of their Lord
  70,29,and those who guard their private parts
  70,30,"apart from their spouses and their slave women, for then they are not blameworthy"
  70,31,but whoever seeks beyond that—it is they who are the transgressors
  70,32,and those who keep their trusts and covenants
  70,33,and those who are observant of their testimonies
  70,34,and those who are watchful of their prayers
  70,35,"They will be in gardens, held in honour"
  70,36,What is the matter with the faithless that they scramble toward you
  70,37,"from left and right, in groups"
  70,38,Does each man among them hope to enter the garden of bliss
  70,39,"Never! Indeed, We created them from what they know"
