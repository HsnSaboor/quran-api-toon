quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  41,21,"They will say to their skins, ‘Why did you bear witness against us?’ They will say, ‘We were given speech by Allah, who gave speech to all things. He created you the first time, and you are being brought back to Him"
  41,22,"You did not use to conceal yourselves [while perpetrating sinful acts] lest your hearing, your eyes, or your skins should bear witness against you, but you thought that Allah did not know most of what you did"
  41,23,"That misjudgement, which you entertained about your Lord ruined you. So you became losers.’"
  41,24,"Should they be patient, the Fire is their abode; and should they seek to propitiate [Allah], they will not be redeemed"
  41,25,"We have assigned them companions who make their present [conduct] and future [state] seem decorous to them, and the word became due against them along with the nations of jinn and humans that passed away before them. They were indeed losers"
  41,26,"The faithless say, ‘Do not listen to this Quran and hoot it down so that you may prevail [over the Apostle].’"
  41,27,"We will surely make the faithless taste a severe punishment, and We will surely requite them by the worst of what they used to do"
  41,28,"That is the requital of the enemies of Allah—the Fire! In it, they will have an everlasting abode, as a requital for their impugning Our signs"
  41,29,"The faithless will say, ‘Our Lord! Show us those who led us astray from among jinn and humans so that we may trample them under our feet, so that they may be among the lowermost!’"
