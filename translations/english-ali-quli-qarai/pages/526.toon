quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star when it sets
  53,2,"your companion has neither gone astray, nor amiss"
  53,3,"Nor does he speak out of [his own] desire"
  53,4,"it is just a revelation that is revealed [to him]"
  53,5,taught him by one of great powers
  53,6,possessed of sound judgement. He settled
  53,7,while he was on the highest horizon
  53,8,Then he drew nearer and nearer
  53,9,until he was within two bows’ length or even nearer
  53,10,whereat He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed
  53,11,The heart did not deny what it saw
  53,12,Will you then dispute with him about what he saw
  53,13,Certainly he saw it yet another time
  53,14,by the Lote Tree of the Ultimate Boundary
  53,15,near which is the Garden of the Abode
  53,16,when there covered the Lote Tree what covered it
  53,17,"His gaze did not swerve, nor did it overstep the bounds"
  53,18,Certainly he saw some of the greatest signs of his Lord
  53,19,Have you considered Lat and ‘Uzza
  53,20,"and Manat, the third one"
  53,21,Are you to have males and He females
  53,22,"That, then, will be an unfair division"
  53,23,"These are but names, which you have coined—you and your fathers—for which Allah has not sent down any authority. They follow nothing but conjectures and the desires of the [lower] soul, while there has already come to them the guidance from their Lord"
  53,24,Shall man have whatever he yearns for
  53,25,Yet to Allah belong this world and the Hereafter
  53,26,"How many an angel there is in the heavens whose intercession is of not any avail, except after Allah permits whomever He wishes and approves of"
