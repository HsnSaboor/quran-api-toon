quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,80,"It is Allah who has made your homes as a place of rest for you and He made for you homes out of the skins of the cattle which you find portable on the day of your shifting and on the day of your halt, and out of their wool, fur and hair [He has appointed] furniture and wares [enduring] for a while"
  16,81,"It is Allah who made for you the shade from what He has created, and made for you retreats in the mountains, and made for you garments that protect you from heat, and garments that protect you from your [mutual] violence. That is how He completes His blessing upon you so that you may submit [to Him]"
  16,82,"But if they turn their backs [on you], your duty is only to communicate in clear terms"
  16,83,"They recognize the blessing of Allah and then deny it, and most of them are faithless"
  16,84,"The day We shall raise a witness from every nation, the faithless will not be permitted [to speak], nor will they be asked to propitiate [Allah]"
  16,85,"And when the wrongdoers sight the punishment, it shall not be lightened for them, nor will they be granted any respite"
  16,86,"When the polytheists sight their partners, they will say, ‘Our Lord! These are our partners whom we used to invoke besides You.’ But they will retort to them, ‘You are indeed liars!’"
  16,87,"They will submit to Allah on that day, and what they used to fabricate will forsake them"
