quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  38,62,"And they will say, ‘Why is it that we do not see [here] men whom we used to count among the bad ones"
  38,63,"ridiculing them, or do [our] eyes miss them [here]?’"
  38,64,That is indeed a true account of the contentions of the inmates of the Fire
  38,65,"Say, ‘I am just a warner, and there is no god except Allah, the One, the All-paramount"
  38,66,"the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, the All-mighty, the All-forgiver.’"
  38,67,"Say, ‘It is a great prophesy"
  38,68,of which you are disregardful
  38,69,I have no knowledge of the Supernal Elite when they contend
  38,70,All that is revealed to me is that I am just a manifest warner.’
  38,71,"When your Lord said to the angels, ‘Indeed I am about to create a human being out of clay"
  38,72,"So when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My spirit, then fall down in prostration before him.’"
  38,73,"Thereat the angels prostrated, all of them together"
  38,74,but not Iblis; he acted arrogantly and he was one of the faithless
  38,75,"He said, ‘O Iblis! What keeps you from prostrating before that which I have created with My [own] two hands? Are you arrogant, or are you one of the exalted ones?’"
  38,76,"‘I am better than him,’ he said. ‘You created me from fire and You created him from clay.’"
  38,77,"He said, ‘Begone hence, for you are indeed an outcast"
  38,78,and indeed My curse will be on you till the Day of Retribution.’
  38,79,"He said, ‘My Lord! Respite me till the day they will be resurrected.’"
  38,80,"Said He, ‘You are indeed among the reprieved"
  38,81,until the day of the known time.’
  38,82,"He said, ‘By Your might, I will surely pervert them"
  38,83,except Your exclusive servants among them.’
