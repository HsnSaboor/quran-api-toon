quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,11,"Indeed those who initiated the calumny are a group from among yourselves. Do not suppose it is bad thing for you. No, it is for your good. Each man among them bears [the onus for] his share in the sin, and as for him who assumed its major burden from among them, there is a great punishment for him"
  24,12,"When you [first] heard about it, why did not the faithful, men and women, think well of their folks, and say, ‘This is an obvious calumny’"
  24,13,"Why did they not bring four witnesses to it? So when they could not bring the witnesses, they are liars in Allah’s sight"
  24,14,"Were it not for Allah’s grace and His mercy upon you in this world and the Hereafter, there would have befallen you a great punishment for what you ventured into"
  24,15,"when you were receiving it on your tongues, and were mouthing something of which you had no knowledge, supposing it to be a light matter, while it was a grave [matter] with Allah"
  24,16,"And why did you not, when you heard it, say, ‘It is not for us to say such a thing. [O Allah!] You are immaculate! This is a monstrous calumny!’"
  24,17,"Allah advises you lest you should ever repeat the like of it, should you be faithful"
  24,18,"Allah clarifies the signs for you, and Allah is all-knowing, all-wise"
  24,19,"Indeed those who want indecency to spread among the faithful—there is a painful punishment for them in the world and the Hereafter, and Allah knows and you do not know"
  24,20,"Were it not for Allah’s grace and His mercy upon you, and that Allah is all-kind, all-merciful…"
