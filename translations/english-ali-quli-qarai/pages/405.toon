quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,6,"[This is] a promise of Allah: Allah does not break His promise, but most people do not know"
  30,7,"They know just an outward aspect of the life of the world, but they are oblivious of the Hereafter"
  30,8,Have they not reflected in their own souls? Allah did not create the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them except with consummate wisdom and for a specified term. Indeed many people disbelieve in the encounter with their Lord
  30,9,"Have they not travelled in the land and seen how was the fate of those who were before them? They were more powerful than them, and they plowed the earth and developed it more than they have developed it. Their apostles brought them manifest proofs. So it was not Allah who wronged them, but it was they who used to wrong themselves"
  30,10,Then the fate of those who committed misdeeds was that they denied the signs of Allah and they used to deride them
  30,11,"Allah originates the creation, then He will bring it back, then you will be brought back to Him"
  30,12,"And when the Hour sets in, the guilty will despair"
  30,13,"None of those whom they ascribed as partners [to Allah] will intercede for them, and they will disavow their partners"
  30,14,"The day the Hour sets in, they will be divided on that day [in separate groups]"
  30,15,"As for those who have faith and do righteous deeds, they shall be in a garden, rejoicing"
