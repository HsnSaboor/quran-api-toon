quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the Dawn
  89,2,by the ten nights
  89,3,by the Even and the Odd
  89,4,by the night when it departs
  89,5,Is there an oath in that for one possessing intellect
  89,6,"Have you not regarded how your Lord dealt with [the people of] ‘Ad"
  89,7,"[and] Iram, [the city] of the pillars"
  89,8,the like of which was not created among cities
  89,9,"and [the people of] Thamud, who hollowed out the rocks in the valley"
  89,10,"and Pharaoh, the impaler"
  89,11,"—those who rebelled [against Allah] in their cities"
  89,12,and caused much corruption in them
  89,13,so your Lord poured on them lashes of punishment
  89,14,Indeed your Lord is in ambush
  89,15,"As for man, whenever his Lord tests him, and grants him honour, and blesses him, he says, ‘My Lord has honoured me.’"
  89,16,"But when He tests him and tightens for him his provision, he says, ‘My Lord has humiliated me.’"
  89,17,"No indeed! No, you do not honour the orphan"
  89,18,and do not urge the feeding of the needy
  89,19,You eat the inheritance rapaciously
  89,20,and love wealth with much fondness
  89,21,No indeed! When the earth is levelled to a plain
  89,22,"and your Lord [’s edict] arrives with the angels in ranks"
  89,23,"the day when hell is brought [near], man will take admonition on that day, but what will that admonition avail him"
