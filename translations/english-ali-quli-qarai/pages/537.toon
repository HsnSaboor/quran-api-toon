quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,This is indeed a noble Quran
  56,78,in a guarded Book
  56,79,—no one touches it except the pure ones—
  56,80,sent down gradually from the Lord of all the worlds
  56,81,What! Do you take lightly this discourse
  56,82,And make your denial of it your vocation
  56,83,"So when it reaches the throat [of the dying person]"
  56,84,"and at that moment you are looking on [at his bedside]"
  56,85,"—and We are nearer to him than you are, though you do not perceive—"
  56,86,"then why do you not restore it, if you are not subject"
  56,87,"[to Divine dispensation], if you are truthful"
  56,88,"Then, if he be of those brought near"
  56,89,"then ease, abundance, and a garden of bliss"
  56,90,And if he be of the People of the Right Hand
  56,91,"then [he will be told,] ‘Peace be on you, from the People of the Right Hand!’"
  56,92,"But if he be of the impugners, the astray ones"
  56,93,then a treat of boiling water
  56,94,and entry into hell
  56,95,Indeed this is certain truth
  56,96,"So celebrate the Name of your Lord, the All-supreme"
  57,1,"Whatever there is in the heavens and [whatever there is on] the earth glorifies Allah and He is the All-mighty, the All-wise"
  57,2,"To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth: He gives life and brings death, and He has power over all things"
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden, and He has knowledge of all things"
