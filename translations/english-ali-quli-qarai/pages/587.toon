quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When the sky is rent apart
  82,2,when the stars are scattered
  82,3,when the seas are merged
  82,4,when the graves are overturned
  82,5,then a soul shall know what it has sent ahead and left behind
  82,6,O man! What has deceived you about your generous Lord
  82,7,"who created you and proportioned you, and gave you an upright nature"
  82,8,and composed you in any form that He wished
  82,9,"No! Indeed, you deny the Retribution"
  82,10,"Indeed, there are over you watchers"
  82,11,noble writers
  82,12,who know whatever you do
  82,13,Indeed the pious shall be amid bliss
  82,14,and indeed the vicious shall be in hell
  82,15,entering it on the Day of Retribution
  82,16,and they shall not be absent from it
  82,17,And what will show you what is the Day of Retribution
  82,18,"Again, what will show you what is the Day of Retribution"
  82,19,It is a day when no soul will be of any avail to another soul and all command that day will belong to Allah
  83,1,"Woe to the defrauders, who use short measures"
  83,2,"who, when they measure [a commodity bought] from the people, take the full measure"
  83,3,but diminish when they measure or weigh for them
  83,4,Do they not know that they will be resurrected
  83,5,on a tremendous day
  83,6,a day when mankind will stand before the Lord of all the worlds
