quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,28,"‘When you, and those who are with you, are settled in the ark, say, ‘‘All praise belongs to Allah, who has delivered us from the wrongdoing lot.’’"
  23,29,"And say, ‘‘My Lord! Land me with a blessed landing, for You are the best of those who bring ashore.’’ ’"
  23,30,"There are indeed signs in this; and indeed, We have been testing"
  23,31,Then after them We brought forth another generation
  23,32,"and We sent them an apostle from among themselves, saying, ‘Worship Allah! You have no other god besides Him. Will you not then be wary [of Him]?’"
  23,33,"Said the elite of his people, who were faithless and who denied the encounter of the Hereafter and whom We had given affluence in the life of the world: ‘This is just a human being like yourselves: he eats what you eat, and drinks what you drink"
  23,34,"If you obey a human being like yourselves, you will indeed be losers"
  23,35,"Does he promise you that when you have died and become bones and dust you will indeed be raised [from the dead]"
  23,36,"Far-fetched, far-fetched is what you are promised"
  23,37,"There is nothing but the life of this world: we live and die, and we will not be resurrected"
  23,38,"He is just a man who has fabricated a lie against Allah, and we will not believe in him.’"
  23,39,"He said, ‘My Lord! Help me, for they impugn me.’"
  23,40,"Said He, ‘In a little while they will become regretful.’"
  23,41,So the Cry seized them justly and We turned them into a scum. So away with the wrongdoing lot
  23,42,Then after them We brought forth other generations
