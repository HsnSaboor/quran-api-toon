quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  71,11,He will send for you abundant rains from the sky
  71,12,"and aid you with wealth and sons, and provide you with gardens and provide you with streams"
  71,13,What is the matter with you that you do not look upon Allah with veneration
  71,14,"though He has created you in [various] stages"
  71,15,Have you not seen how Allah has created the seven heavens in layers
  71,16,and has made therein the moon for a light and the sun for a lamp
  71,17,"Allah made you grow from the earth, with a [vegetable] growth"
  71,18,"Then He makes you return to it, and He will bring you forth [without fail]"
  71,19,Allah has made the earth a vast expanse for you
  71,20,so that you may travel over its spacious ways.’’ ’
  71,21,"Noah said, ‘My Lord! They have disobeyed me, following someone whose wealth and children only add to his loss"
  71,22,and they have devised an outrageous plot
  71,23,"They say, ‘‘Do not abandon your gods. Do not abandon Wadd, nor Suwa, nor Yaghuth, Ya‘uq and Nasr,’’"
  71,24,and already they have led many astray. Do not increase the wrongdoers in anything but error.’
  71,25,"They were drowned because of their iniquities, then made to enter a Fire, and they did not find any helpers for themselves besides Allah"
  71,26,"And Noah said, ‘My Lord! ‘Do not leave on the earth any inhabitant from among the faithless"
