quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  58,12,"O you who have faith! When you converse privately with the Apostle, offer a charity before your private talk. That is better for you and purer. But if you cannot afford [to make the offering], then Allah is indeed all-forgiving, all-merciful"
  58,13,"Were you dismayed by having to offer charities before your private talks? Since you did not do it, and Allah has excused you [for not be able to comply], now maintain the prayer and pay the zakat, and obey Allah and His Apostle. Allah is well aware of what you do"
  58,14,"Have you not regarded those who befriend a people at whom Allah is wrathful? They neither belong to you, nor to them, and they swear false oaths [that they are with you] and they know"
  58,15,Allah has prepared a severe punishment for them. Evil indeed is what they used to do
  58,16,"They make a shield of their oaths and bar [people] from the way of Allah; so there is a humiliating punishment for them"
  58,17,"Their possessions and children will not avail them in any way against Allah. They shall be the inmates of the Fire and they shall remain in it [forever]"
  58,18,"The day when Allah will raise them all together, they will swear to Him, just like they swear to you [now], supposing that they stand on something. Look! They are indeed liars"
  58,19,"Satan has prevailed upon them, so he has caused them to forget the remembrance of Allah. They are Satan’s confederates. Look! Indeed, it is Satan’s confederates who are the losers"
  58,20,Indeed those who oppose Allah and His Apostle—they will be among the most abased
  58,21,"Allah has ordained: ‘I shall surely prevail, I and My apostles.’ Indeed Allah is all-strong, all-mighty"
