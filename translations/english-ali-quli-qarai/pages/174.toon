quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  7,179,"Certainly We have winnowed out for hell many of the jinn and humans: they have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, they have ears with which they do not hear. They are like cattle; indeed, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless"
  7,180,"To Allah belong the Best Names, so supplicate Him by them, and abandon those who commit sacrilege in His names. Soon they shall be requited for what they used to do"
  7,181,Among those We have created are a nation who guide by the truth and do justice thereby
  7,182,"As for those who deny Our signs, We will draw them imperceptibly [into ruin], whence they do not know"
  7,183,"And I will grant them respite, for My devising is indeed sure"
  7,184,"Have they not reflected that there is no madness in their companion, [and that] he is just a manifest warner"
  7,185,"Have they not contemplated the dominions of the heavens and the earth, and whatever things Allah has created, and that maybe their time has already drawn near? So what discourse will they believe after this"
  7,186,"Whomever Allah leads astray has no guide, and He leaves them bewildered in their rebellion"
  7,187,"They question you concerning the Hour, when will it set in? Say, ‘Its knowledge is only with my Lord: none except Him shall manifest it at its time. It will weigh heavy on the heavens and the earth. It will not overtake you but suddenly.’ They ask you as if you were in the know of it. Say, ‘Its knowledge is only with Allah, but most people do not know.’"
