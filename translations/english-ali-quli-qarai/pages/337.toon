quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,39,"Those who are fought against are permitted [to fight] because they have been wronged, and Allah is indeed able to help them"
  22,40,"—those who were expelled from their homes unjustly, only because they said, ‘Allah is our Lord.’ Had not Allah repulsed the people from one another, ruin would have befallen the monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques in which Allah’s Name is much invoked. Allah will surely help those who help Him. Indeed Allah is all-strong, all-mighty"
  22,41,"Those who, if We granted them power in the land, will maintain the prayer, give the zakat, bid what is right and forbid what is wrong. And with Allah rests the outcome of all matters"
  22,42,"If they impugn you, the people of Noah had impugned before them and ‘Ad and Thamud"
  22,43,"[as well as] the people of Abraham and the people of Lot"
  22,44,"and the inhabitants of Midian, and Moses was also impugned. But I gave the faithless a respite, then I seized them and how was My rebuttal"
  22,45,"How many towns We have destroyed when they had been wrongdoers! So they lie fallen on their trellises, their wells neglected and their ruined palaces"
  22,46,"Have they not travelled through the land so that they may have hearts by which they may exercise their reason, or ears by which they may hear? Indeed, it is not the eyes that turn blind, but it is the hearts in the breasts that turn blind"
