quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,44,Allah alternates the night and the day. There is indeed a lesson in that for those who have insight
  24,45,"Allah created every animal from water. Among them are some that creep upon their bellies, and among them are some that walk on two feet, and among them are some that walk on four. Allah creates whatever He wishes. Indeed Allah has power over all things"
  24,46,"Certainly We have sent down illuminating signs, and Allah guides whomever He wishes to a straight path"
  24,47,"They say, ‘We have faith in Allah and His Apostle, and we obey.’ Then, after that, a part of them refuse to comply, and they do not have faith"
  24,48,"When they are summoned to Allah and His Apostle that He may judge between them, behold, a part of them turn aside"
  24,49,"But if justice be on their side, they come compliantly to him"
  24,50,"Is there a sickness in their hearts? Do they have doubts, or fear that Allah and His Apostle will be unjust to them? Indeed, it is they who are the wrongdoers"
  24,51,"All the response of the faithful, when they are summoned to Allah and His Apostle that He may judge between them, is to say, ‘We hear and obey.’ It is they who are the felicitous"
  24,52,"Whoever obeys Allah and His Apostle, and fears Allah and is wary of Him—it is they who will be the triumphant"
  24,53,"They swear by Allah with solemn oaths that if you order them they will surely march out. Say, ‘Do not swear! Honourable obedience [is all that is expected of you]. Allah is indeed well aware of what you do.’"
