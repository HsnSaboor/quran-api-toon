quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  13,19,"Is someone who knows that what has been sent down to you from your Lord is the truth, like someone who is blind? Only those who possess intellect take admonition"
  13,20,—those who fulfill Allah’s covenant and do not break the pledge solemnly made
  13,21,"and those who join what Allah has commanded to be joined, and fear their Lord, and are afraid of an adverse reckoning"
  13,22,"—those who are patient for the sake of their Lord’s pleasure, maintain the prayer, and spend secretly and openly out of what We have provided them, and repel evil [conduct] with good. For such will be the reward of the [ultimate] abode"
  13,23,"the Gardens of Eden, which they will enter along with whoever is righteous from among their forebears, their spouses, and their descendants, and the angels will call on them from every door"
  13,24,"‘Peace be to you, for your patience.’ How excellent is the reward of the [ultimate] abode"
  13,25,"But as for those who break Allah’s compact after having pledged it solemnly, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and cause corruption in the earth—it is such on whom the curse will lie, and for them will be the ills of the [ultimate] abode"
  13,26,"Allah expands the provision for whomever He wishes, and tightens it. They boast of the life of this world, but compared with the Hereafter the life of this world is but a [trifling] enjoyment"
  13,27,"The faithless say, ‘Why has not some sign been sent down to him from his Lord?’ Say, ‘Indeed Allah leads astray whomever He wishes, and guides to Himself those who turn penitently [to Him]"
  13,28,—those who have faith and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah.’ Behold! The hearts find rest in Allah’s remembrance
