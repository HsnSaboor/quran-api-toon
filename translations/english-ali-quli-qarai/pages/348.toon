quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,90,"Indeed, We have brought them the truth, and they are indeed liars"
  23,91,"Allah has not taken any offspring, neither is there any god besides Him, for then each god would take away what he created, and some of them would surely rise up against others. Clear is Allah of what they allege"
  23,92,"The Knower of the sensible and the Unseen, He is above having any partners that they ascribe [to Him]"
  23,93,"Say, ‘My Lord! If You should show me what they are promised"
  23,94,"then do not put me, my Lord, among the wrongdoing lot.’"
  23,95,We are indeed able to show you what We promise them
  23,96,"Repel ill [conduct] with that which is the best. We know best whatever they allege"
  23,97,"Say, ‘My Lord! I seek Your protection from the promptings of devils"
  23,98,"and I seek Your protection, my Lord, from their presence near me.’"
  23,99,"When death comes to one of them, he says, ‘My Lord! Take me back"
  23,100,that I may act righteously in what I have left behind.’ ‘By no means! These are mere words that he says.’ And before them is a barrier until the day they will be resurrected
  23,101,"When the Trumpet is blown, there will be no ties between them on that day, nor will they ask [about] each other"
  23,102,Then those whose deeds weigh heavy in the scales—it is they who are the felicitous
  23,103,"As for those whose deeds weigh light in the scales—they will be the ones who have ruined their souls, and they will remain in hell [forever]"
  23,104,"The Fire will scorch their faces, while they snarl baring their teeth"
