quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,1,"All praise belongs to Allah who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light. Yet the faithless equate [others] with their Lord"
  6,2,"It is He who created you from clay, then ordained the term [of your life]—the specified term is with Him—and yet you are in doubt"
  6,3,"He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth: He knows your secret and your overt [matters], and He knows what you earn"
  6,4,"There did not come to them any sign from among the signs of their Lord, but that they used to disregard it"
  6,5,"They have certainly denied the truth when it came to them, but soon there will come to them the news of what they have been deriding"
  6,6,"Have they not regarded how many a generation We have destroyed before them whom We had granted power in the land in respects that We did not grant you, and We sent abundant rains for them from the sky and made streams run for them? Then We destroyed them for their sins, and brought forth another generation after them"
  6,7,"Had We sent down to you a Book on paper so they could touch it with their [own] hands, [still] the faithless would have said, ‘This is nothing but plain magic.’"
  6,8,"They say, ‘Why has not an angel been sent down to him?’ Were We to send down an angel, the matter would surely be decided, and then they would not be granted any respite"
