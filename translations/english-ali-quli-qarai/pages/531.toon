quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,"and Our command is but a single [word], like the twinkling of an eye"
  54,51,Certainly We have destroyed your likes. So is there anyone who will be admonished
  54,52,Everything they have done is in the books
  54,53,and everything big and small is committed to writing
  54,54,Indeed the Godwary will be amid gardens and streams
  54,55,in the abode of truthfulness with an omnipotent King
  55,1,The All-beneficent
  55,2,has taught the Quran
  55,3,He created man
  55,4,"[and] taught him articulate speech"
  55,5,"The sun and the moon are [disposed] calculatedly"
  55,6,"and the herb and the tree prostrate [to Allah]"
  55,7,He raised the heaven high and set up the balance
  55,8,"declaring, ‘Do not infringe the balance"
  55,9,"Maintain the weights with justice, and do not shorten the balance!’"
  55,10,And the earth—He laid it out for mankind
  55,11,In it are fruits and date-palms with sheaths
  55,12,"grain with husk, and fragrant herbs"
  55,13,So which of your Lord’s bounties will you both deny
  55,14,"He created man out of dry clay, like the potter’s"
  55,15,and created the jinn out of a flame of a fire
  55,16,So which of your Lord’s bounties will you both deny
