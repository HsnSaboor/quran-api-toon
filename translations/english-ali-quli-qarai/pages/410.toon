quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"And if We send a wind and they see it turn yellow, they will surely become ungrateful after that"
  30,52,"Indeed you cannot make the dead hear, nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs [upon you]"
  30,53,nor can you lead the blind out of their error. You can make only those hear who have faith in Our signs and have submitted
  30,54,"It is Allah who created you from [a state of] weakness, then He gave you power after weakness. Then, after power, He ordained weakness and old age: He creates whatever He wishes, and He is the All-knowing, the All-powerful"
  30,55,"On the day when the Hour sets in, the guilty will swear that they had remained only for an hour. That is how they were used to lying [in the world]"
  30,56,"But those who were given knowledge and faith will say, ‘Certainly you remained in Allah’s Book until the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day of Resurrection, but you did not know.’"
  30,57,"On that day, the excuses of the wrongdoers will not benefit them, nor will they be asked to propitiate [Allah]"
  30,58,"Certainly we have drawn for mankind in this Quran every [kind of] parable. Indeed if you bring them a sign, the faithless will surely say, ‘You are nothing but fabricators!’"
  30,59,Thus does Allah seal the hearts of those who do not know
  30,60,So be patient! Allah’s promise is indeed true. And do not let yourself be upset by those who have no conviction
