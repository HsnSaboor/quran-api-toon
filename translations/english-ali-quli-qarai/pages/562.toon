quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  67,1,"Blessed is He in whose hands is all sovereignty, and He has power over all things"
  67,2,"He, who created death and life that He may test you [to see] which of you is best in conduct. And He is the All-mighty, the All-forgiving"
  67,3,He created seven heavens in layers. You do not see any discordance in the creation of the All-beneficent. Look again! Do you see any flaw
  67,4,"Look again, once more. Your look will return to you humbled and weary"
  67,5,"We have certainly adorned the lowest heaven with lamps, and made them [the means of pelting] missiles against the devils, and We have prepared for them a punishment of the Blaze"
  67,6,"For those who defy their Lord is the punishment of hell, and it is an evil destination"
  67,7,"When they are thrown in it, they hear it blaring, as it seethes"
  67,8,"almost exploding with rage. Whenever a group is thrown in it, its keepers will ask them, ‘Did not any warner come to you?’"
  67,9,"They will say, ‘Yes, a warner did come to us, but we impugned [him] and said, ‘Allah did not send down anything; you are only in great error.’"
  67,10,"And they will say, ‘Had we listened or applied reason, we would not have been among inmates of the Blaze.’"
  67,11,Thus they will admit their sin. So away with the inmates of the Blaze
  67,12,Indeed for those who fear their Lord in secret there will be forgiveness and a great reward
