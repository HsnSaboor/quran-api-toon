  8,34,"What [excuse] have they that Allah should not punish them, when they bar [the faithful] from the Holy Mosque, and they are not its custodians? Its custodians are only the Godwary, but most of them do not know"
  8,35,Their prayer at the House is nothing but whistling and clapping. So taste the punishment because of what you used to defy
  8,36,"Indeed the faithless spend their wealth to bar from the way of Allah. Soon they will have spent it, then it will be a cause of regret to them, then they will be overcome, and the faithless will be gathered toward Hell"
  8,37,"so that Allah may separate the bad ones from the good, and place the bad on one another, and pile them up together, and cast them into hell. It is they who are the losers"
  8,38,"Say to the faithless, if they cease [their belligerence against the Muslims], what is already past shall be forgiven them. But if they resume [their hostilities], then the precedent of the predecessors has already come to pass"
  8,39,"Fight them until persecution is no more, and religion becomes exclusively for Allah. So if they desist, Allah indeed watches what they do"
  8,40,"But if they turn away, then know that Allah is your master: an excellent master and an excellent helper"
