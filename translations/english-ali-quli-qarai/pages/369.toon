  26,40,"‘Maybe we will follow the magicians, if they are victors!’"
  26,41,"So when the magicians came, they said to Pharaoh, ‘Shall we have a reward if we were to be the victors?’"
  26,42,"He said, ‘Of course; and you will be among members of my inner circle.’"
  26,43,"Moses said to them, ‘Throw down whatever you have to throw!’"
  26,44,"So they threw down their sticks and ropes, and said, ‘By the might of Pharaoh, we shall surely be victorious!’"
  26,45,"Thereat Moses threw down his staff, and behold, it was swallowing what they had faked"
  26,46,Thereat the magicians fell down prostrating
  26,47,"They said, ‘We believe in the Lord of all the worlds"
  26,48,the Lord of Moses and Aaron.’
  26,49,"He [i.e. Pharaoh] said, ‘Do you profess faith in Him before I should permit you? He is indeed your chief who has taught you magic! Soon you will know! I will cut off your hands and feet from opposite sides, and I will crucify you all.’"
  26,50,"They said, ‘[There is] no harm [in that]! Indeed, we shall return to our Lord"
  26,51,Indeed we hope our Lord will forgive us our offences for being the first to believe.’
  26,52,"Then We revealed to Moses, [saying],‘Set out with My servants at night, for you will be pursued.’"
  26,53,Then Pharaoh sent heralds to the cities
  26,54,"[proclaiming:] ‘These are indeed a small band"
  26,55,They have aroused our wrath
  26,56,and we are alert and fully prepared.’
  26,57,So We took them out of gardens and springs
  26,58,"and [made them leave behind] treasures and stately homes"
  26,59,So it was; and We bequeathed them to the Children of Israel
  26,60,Then they pursued them at sunrise
