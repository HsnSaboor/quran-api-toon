  19,77,"Have you not regarded him who defies Our signs, and says, ‘I will surely be given wealth and children’"
  19,78,"Has he come to know the Unseen, or taken a promise from the All-beneficent"
  19,79,"No indeed! We will write down what he says, and We will prolong his punishment endlessly"
  19,80,"We shall take over from him what he talks about, and he will come to Us alone"
  19,81,"They have taken gods besides Allah that they may be a [source of] might to them"
  19,82,"No Indeed! Soon they will disown their worship, and they will be their opponents"
  19,83,Have you not regarded that We unleash the devils upon the faithless to urge them vigorously
  19,84,"So do not make haste against them; indeed We are counting for them, a counting [down]"
  19,85,"The day We shall gather the Godwary toward the All-beneficent, on mounts"

  19,90,"The heavens are about to be rent apart at it, the earth to split open, and the mountains to collapse into bits"
  19,91,that they should ascribe a son to the All-beneficent
  19,92,It does not behoove the All-beneficent to take a son
  19,93,There is none in the heavens and the earth but he comes to the All-beneficent as a servant
  19,94,"Certainly He has counted them [all] and numbered them precisely"
  19,95,and each of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection
