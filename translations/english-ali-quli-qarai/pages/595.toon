quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and her forenoon splendour
  91,2,by the moon when he follows her
  91,3,by the day when it reveals her
  91,4,by the night when it covers her
  91,5,by the sky and Him who built it
  91,6,by the earth and Him who spread it
  91,7,by the soul and Him who fashioned it
  91,8,"and inspired it with [discernment between] its virtues and vices"
  91,9,one who purifies it is felicitous
  91,10,and one who betrays it fails
  91,11,"The [people of] Thamud denied [Allah’s signs] out of their rebellion"
  91,12,when the most wretched of them rose up
  91,13,"The apostle of Allah had told them, ‘This is Allah’s she-camel, let her drink!’"
  91,14,"But they impugned him and hamstrung her. So their Lord took them unawares by night because of their sin, and levelled it"
  91,15,And He does not fear its outcome
  92,1,By the night when it envelops
  92,2,by the day when it brightens
  92,3,by Him who created the male and the female
  92,4,your endeavours are indeed diverse
  92,5,As for him who gives and is Godwary
  92,6,and confirms the best promise
  92,7,We will surely ease him toward facility
  92,8,"But as for him, who is stingy and self-complacent"
  92,9,and denies the best promise
  92,10,We will surely ease him toward hardship
  92,11,His wealth will not avail him when he perishes
  92,12,Indeed guidance rests with Us
  92,13,and to Us belong the world and the Hereafter
  92,14,So I warn you of a blazing fire
