  99,1,When the earth is rocked with a terrible quake
  99,2,and discharges its burdens
  99,3,"and man says, ‘What is the matter with her?’"
  99,4,On that day she will relate her chronicles
  99,5,for her Lord will have inspired her
  99,6,"On that day, mankind will issue forth in various groups to be shown their deeds"

  100,1,By the snorting chargers
  100,2,"by the strikers of sparks [with their hoofs]"
  100,3,by the raiders at dawn
  100,4,raising therein a trail of dust
  100,5,and cleaving therein a host
  100,6,Indeed man is ungrateful to his Lord
  100,7,"and indeed he is [himself] witness to that"
  100,8,And indeed he is an avid lover of wealth
  100,9,"Does he not know, when what is [buried] in the graves is turned over"
