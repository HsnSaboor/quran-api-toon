quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"Say, ‘I have no control over any benefit for myself, nor [over] any harm except what Allah may wish. Had I known the Unseen, I would have acquired much good, and no ill would have befallen me. I am only a warner and bearer of good news to a people who have faith.’"
  7,189,"It is He who created you from a single soul, and made from it its mate, that he might find comfort with her. So when he had covered her, she bore a light burden and passed [some time] with it. When she had grown heavy, they both invoked Allah, their Lord: ‘If You give us a healthy [child], we will be surely grateful.’"
  7,190,"Then when He gave them a healthy [child], they ascribed partners to Him in what He had given them. Exalted is Allah above [having] any partners that they ascribe [to Him]"
  7,191,"Do they ascribe [to Him] partners that create nothing and have been created themselves"
  7,192,"and can neither help them, nor help themselves"
  7,193,"If you call them to guidance, they will not follow you: it is the same to you whether you call them or whether you are silent"
  7,194,"Indeed those whom you invoke besides Allah are creatures like you. So invoke them: they should answer you, if you are truthful"
  7,195,"Do they have any feet to walk with? Do they have any hands to grasp with? Do they have any eyes to see with? Do they have any ears to hear with? Say, ‘Invoke your partners [that you ascribe to Allah] and try out your stratagems against me without granting me any respite"
