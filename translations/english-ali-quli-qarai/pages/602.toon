quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,"[In gratitude] for solidarity among the Quraysh"
  106,2,their solidarity during winter and summer journeys
  106,3,let them worship the Lord of this House
  106,4,"who has fed them [and saved them] from hunger, and secured them from fear"
  107,1,Did you see him who denies the Retribution
  107,2,"That is the one, who drives away the orphan"
  107,3,and does not urge the feeding of the needy
  107,4,Woe to those who pray
  107,5,but are heedless of their prayers
  107,6,—who show off
  107,7,but deny aid
  108,1,Indeed We have given you abundance
  108,2,"So pray to your Lord, and sacrifice [the sacrificial camel]"
  108,3,Indeed it is your enemy who is without posterity
