  14,14,"and surely We will settle you in the land after them. This [promise] is for someone who is awed to stand before Me and fears My threat.’"

  14,18,"A parable of those who defy their Lord: their deeds are like ashes over which the wind blows hard on a tempestuous day: they have no power over anything they have earned. That is extreme error"
