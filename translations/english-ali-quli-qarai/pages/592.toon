quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,But you prefer the life of this world
  87,17,while the Hereafter is better and more lasting.’
  87,18,This is indeed in the former scriptures
  87,19,the scriptures of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Did you receive the account of the Enveloper
  88,2,Some faces on that day will be humbled
  88,3,wrought-up and weary
  88,4,they will enter a scorching fire
  88,5,and made to drink from a boiling spring
  88,6,They will have no food except cactus
  88,7,"neither nourishing, nor of avail against hunger"
  88,8,Some faces on that day will be joyous
  88,9,pleased with their endeavour
  88,10,in a lofty garden
  88,11,where they will not hear any vain talk
  88,12,In it is a flowing spring
  88,13,and raised couches
  88,14,with goblets set
  88,15,and cushions laid out in an array
  88,16,and carpets spread out
  88,17,"Do they not observe the camel, [to see] how it has been created"
  88,18,"and the sky, how it has been raised"
  88,19,"and the mountains, how they have been set"
  88,20,"and the earth, how it has been surfaced"
  88,21,So admonish—for you are only an admonisher
  88,22,and not a taskmaster over them—
  88,23,except him who turns back and disbelieves
  88,24,Him Allah will punish with the greatest punishment
  88,25,Indeed to Us will be their return
  88,26,"Then, indeed, their reckoning will lie with Us"
