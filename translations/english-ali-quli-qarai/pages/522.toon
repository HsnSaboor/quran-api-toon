quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"He said, ‘O messengers, what is now your errand?’"
  51,32,"They said, ‘We have been sent toward a guilty people"
  51,33,that We may rain upon them stones of clay
  51,34,sent for the transgressors from your Lord
  51,35,So We picked out those who were in it of the faithful
  51,36,but We did not find there other than one house of Muslims
  51,37,and We have left therein a sign for those who fear a painful punishment.’
  51,38,"And in Moses [too there is a sign] when We sent him to Pharaoh with a manifest authority"
  51,39,"But he turned away assured of his might, and said, ‘A magician or a crazy man!’"
  51,40,"So We seized him and his hosts, and cast them into the sea, while he was blameworthy"
  51,41,And in ‘Ad when We unleashed upon them a barren wind
  51,42,It left nothing that it came upon without making it like decayed bones
  51,43,"And in Thamud, when they were told, ‘Enjoy for a while.’"
  51,44,Then they defied the command of their Lord; so the thunderbolt seized them as they looked on
  51,45,"So they were neither able to rise up, nor to come to one another’s aid"
  51,46,"And the people of Noah aforetime. Indeed, they were a transgressing lot"
  51,47,"We have built the heaven with might, and indeed it is We who are its expanders"
  51,48,"And We have spread out the earth, so how excellent spreaders We have been"
  51,49,In all things We have created pairs so that you may take admonition
  51,50,"‘So flee toward Allah. Indeed, I am from Him a manifest warner to you"
  51,51,Do not set up another god besides Allah. Indeed I am from Him a manifest warner to you.’
