quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,"A faithful man or woman may not have any option in their matter, when Allah and His Apostle have decided on a matter, and whoever disobeys Allah and His Apostle has certainly strayed into manifest error"
  33,37,"When you said to him whom Allah had blessed, and whom you [too] had blessed, ‘Retain your wife for yourself, and be wary of Allah,’ and you had hidden in your heart what Allah was to divulge, and you feared the people though Allah is worthier that you should fear Him, so when Zayd had got through with her, We wedded her to you, so that there may be no blame on the faithful in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have got through with them, and Allah’s command is bound to be fulfilled"
  33,38,"There is no blame on the Prophet in respect of that which Allah has made lawful for him: Allah’s precedent with those who passed away earlier (and Allah’s commands are ordained by a precise ordaining)"
  33,39,"such as deliver the messages of Allah and fear Him, and fear no one except Allah, and Allah suffices as reckoner"
  33,40,"Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Apostle of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets, and Allah has knowledge of all things"
  33,41,O you who have faith! Remember Allah with frequent remembrance
  33,42,and glorify Him morning and evening
  33,43,"It is He who blesses you—and so do His angels—that He may bring you out from darkness into light, and He is most merciful to the faithful"
