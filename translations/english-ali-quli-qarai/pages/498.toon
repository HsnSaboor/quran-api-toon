quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  44,40,Indeed the Day of Judgement is the tryst for them all
  44,41,"the day when a friend will not avail a friend in any way, nor will they be helped"
  44,42,"except for him on whom Allah has mercy. Indeed He is the All-mighty, the All-merciful"
  44,43,Indeed the tree of Zaqqum
  44,44,will be the food of the sinful
  44,45,Like molten copper it will boil in their bellies
  44,46,seething like boiling water
  44,47,"[The keepers of hell will be told,] ‘Seize him and drag him to the middle of hell"
  44,48,then pour over his head boiling water as punishment
  44,49,"[and tell them,] “Taste this! Indeed you are the [self-styled] mighty and noble"
  44,50,This is what you used to doubt!’
  44,51,Indeed the Godwary will be in a safe place
  44,52,amid gardens and springs
  44,53,"dressed in fine silk and brocade, sitting face to face"
  44,54,"So shall it be, and We shall wed them to black-eyed houris"
  44,55,"Secure [from any kind of harm,] there they will call for every kind of fruit [they wish]"
  44,56,"Other than the first death, they will not taste death therein, and He will save them from the punishment of hell"
  44,57,—a grace from your Lord. That is the great success
  44,58,"Indeed We have made it simple in your language, so that they may take admonition"
  44,59,"So wait! They [too] are waiting"
