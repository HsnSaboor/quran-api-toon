  31,15,"But if they urge you to ascribe to Me as partner that of which you have no knowledge, then do not obey them.

  31,16,"‘O my son! Even if it should be the weight of a mustard seed, and [even though] it should be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, Allah will produce it. Indeed Allah is all-attentive, all-aware"
  31,17,"O my son! Maintain the prayer and bid what is right and forbid what is wrong, and be patient through whatever may befall you. That is indeed the steadiest of courses"
  31,18,"Do not turn your cheek away disdainfully from the people, and do not walk exultantly on the earth. Indeed Allah does not like any swaggering braggart"
  31,19,"Be modest in your bearing, and lower your voice. Indeed the ungainliest of voices is the donkey’s voice.’"
