quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Say, ‘What thing is greatest as witness?’ Say, ‘Allah! [He is] witness between me and you, and this Quran has been revealed to me that I may warn thereby you and whomever it may reach.’ ‘Do you indeed bear witness that there are other gods besides Allah?’ Say, ‘I do not bear witness [to any such thing].’ Say, ‘Indeed He is the One God, and I indeed disown what you associate [with Him].’"

  6,22,"On the day when We gather them all together, We shall say to those who ascribed partners [to Allah] ‘Where are your partners that you used to claim?’"
  6,23,"Then their only excuse will be to say, ‘By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheists.’"
  6,24,"Look, how they forswear themselves, and what they used to fabricate has forsaken them"
  6,25,"There are some of them who prick up their ears at you, but We have cast veils on their hearts lest they should understand it, and a deafness into their ears; and though they should see every sign, they will not believe in it. When they come to you, to dispute with you, the faithless say, ‘These are nothing but myths of the ancients.’"
  6,26,"They dissuade [others] from [following] him, and [themselves] avoid him; yet they destroy no one except themselves, but they are not aware"
  6,27,"Were you to see when they are brought to a halt by the Fire, whereupon they will say, ‘If only we were sent back [into the world]! Then we will not deny the signs of our Lord, and we will be among the faithful!’"
