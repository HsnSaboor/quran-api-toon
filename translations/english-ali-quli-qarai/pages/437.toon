quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  35,19,The blind one and the seer are not equal
  35,20,nor darkness and light
  35,21,nor shade and torrid heat
  35,22,"nor are the living equal to the dead. Indeed Allah makes whomever He wishes to hear, and you cannot make those who are in the graves hear you"
  35,23,You are but a warner
  35,24,Indeed We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and as a warner; and there is not a nation but a warner has passed in it
  35,25,"If they impugn you, those before them have impugned [likewise]: their apostles brought them manifest proofs, [holy] writs, and illuminating scriptures"
  35,26,Then I seized the faithless. So how was My rebuttal
  35,27,"Have you not regarded that Allah sends down water from the sky, with which We produce fruits of diverse hues. And in the mountains are stripes, white and red, of diverse hues, and [others] pitch black"
  35,28,"And of humans and beasts and cattle there are likewise diverse hues. Only those of Allah’s servants having knowledge fear Him. Indeed Allah is all-mighty, all-forgiving"
  35,29,"Indeed those who recite the Book of Allah and maintain the prayer, and spend secretly and openly out of what We have provided them, expect a commerce that will never go bankrupt"
  35,30,"so that He may pay them their full reward and enhance them out of His bounty. Indeed He is all-forgiving, all-appreciative"
