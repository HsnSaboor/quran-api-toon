quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  68,16,Soon We shall brand him on his snout
  68,17,Indeed we have tested them just as We tested the People of the Garden when they vowed they would gather its fruit at dawn
  68,18,and they did not make any exception
  68,19,"Then, a visitation from your Lord visited it while they were asleep"
  68,20,"So, by dawn it was like a harvested field"
  68,21,At dawn they called out to one another
  68,22,"‘Get off early to your field if you have to gather [the fruits].’"
  68,23,"So off they went, murmuring to one another"
  68,24,‘Today no needy man shall come to you in it.’
  68,25,"And they set out at early morning, [considering themselves] able to deprive [the poor of its fruit]"
  68,26,"But when they saw it, they said, ‘We have indeed lost our way!’"
  68,27,"‘No, it is we who have been deprived!’"
  68,28,"The most upright among them said, ‘Did I not tell you, ‘‘Why do you not glorify [Allah]?’’ ’"
  68,29,"They said, ‘Immaculate is our Lord! We have indeed been wrongdoers!’"
  68,30,"Then they turned to one another, blaming each other"
  68,31,"They said, ‘Woe to us! Indeed, we have been rebellious"
  68,32,Maybe our Lord will give us a better one in its place. Indeed we earnestly beseech our Lord.’
  68,33,"Such was their punishment; and the punishment of the Hereafter is surely greater, had they known"
  68,34,Indeed for the Godwary there will be gardens of bliss near their Lord
  68,35,"Shall We treat those who submit [to Us] as [We treat] the guilty"
  68,36,What is the matter with you? How do you judge
  68,37,Do you possess a scripture in which you read
  68,38,that you shall have in it whatever you choose
  68,39,"Do you have a pledge binding on Us until the Day of Resurrection, that you shall indeed have whatever you decide"
  68,40,"Ask them, which of them will aver [any of] that"
  68,41,"Do they have any ‘partners’ [that they claim for Allah]? Then let them produce their partners, if they are truthful"
  68,42,"The day when the catastrophe occurs and they are summoned to prostrate themselves, they will not be able [to do it]"
