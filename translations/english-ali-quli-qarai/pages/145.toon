quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,132,For everyone there are ranks in accordance with what they have done; and your Lord is not oblivious of what they do
  6,133,"Your Lord is the All-sufficient dispenser of mercy. If He wishes, He will take you away, and make whomever He wishes succeed you, just as He produced you from the descendants of another people"
  6,134,"Indeed what you are promised will surely come, and you will not be able to thwart it"
  6,135,"Say, ‘O my people, act according to your ability; I too am acting. Soon you will know in whose favour the outcome of that abode will be. Indeed the wrongdoers will not be felicitous.’"

Evil is the judgement that they make"
  6,137,"That is how to most of the polytheists the slaying of their children is presented as decorous by those whom they ascribe as partners [to Allah], that they may ruin them and confound their religion for them. Had Allah wished, they would not have done it. So leave them with what they fabricate"
