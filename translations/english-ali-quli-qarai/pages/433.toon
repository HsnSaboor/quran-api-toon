  34,40,"On the day He will muster them all together, He will say to the angels, ‘Was it you that these used to worship?’"
  34,41,"They will say, ‘Immaculate are You! You are our wali, not they! No, they used to worship the jinn; most of them had faith in them.’"
  34,42,"‘Today you have no power to benefit or harm one another,’ and We shall say to those who did wrong, ‘Taste the punishment of the Fire which you used to deny.’"
  34,43,"When Our manifest signs are recited to them, they say, ‘This is just a man who desires to keep you from what your fathers used to worship.’ And they say, ‘This is nothing but a fabricated lie.’ The faithless say of the truth when it comes to them: ‘This is nothing but plain magic,’"
  34,44,"though We did not give them any scriptures that they might have studied, nor did We send them any warner before you"

  34,46,"Say, ‘I give you just a single advice: that you rise up for Allah’s sake, in pairs or singly, and then reflect: there is no madness in your companion; he is just a warner to you before [the befalling of] a severe punishment.’"
  34,47,"Say, ‘Whatever reward I may have asked you is for your own good. My [true] reward lies only with Allah, and He is witness to all things.’"
  34,48,"Say, ‘Indeed my Lord hurls the truth. [He is] the knower of all that is Unseen.’"
