quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  70,40,So I swear by the Lord of the easts and the wests that We are able
  70,41,"to replace them with [others] better than them and We are not to be outmaneuvered"
  70,42,So leave them to gossip and play till they encounter the day they are promised
  70,43,"the day when they emerge from graves, hastening, as if racing toward a target"
  70,44,"with a humbled look [in their eyes], overcast by abasement. That is the day they had been promised"
  71,1,"Indeed We sent Noah to his people, [saying,] ‘Warn your people before a painful punishment overtakes them.’"
  71,2,"He said, ‘O my people! Indeed, I am a manifest warner to you"
  71,3,"Worship Allah and be wary of Him, and obey me"
  71,4,"that He may forgive you some of your sins and respite you until a specified time. Indeed when Allah’s [appointed] time comes, it cannot be deferred, if you know.’"
  71,5,"He said, ‘My Lord! Indeed, I have summoned my people night and day"

  71,8,Again I summoned them aloud
  71,9,and again appealed to them publicly and confided with them privately
  71,10,"telling [them]: ‘‘Plead to your Lord for forgiveness. Indeed, He is all-forgiving"
