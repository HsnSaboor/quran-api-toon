quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"The faithful say, ‘If only a surah were sent down!’ But when a conclusive surah is sent down and war is mentioned in it, you see those in whose hearts is a sickness looking upon you with the look of someone fainting at death. So woe to them"
  47,21,"Obedience and upright speech.... So when the matter has been resolved upon [concerning going to war], if they remain true to Allah that will surely be better for them"
  47,22,May it not be that if you were to wield authority you would cause corruption in the land and ill-treat your blood relations
  47,23,"They are the ones whom Allah has cursed, so He made them deaf, and blinded their sight"
  47,24,"Do they not contemplate the Quran, or are there locks on the hearts"
  47,25,"Indeed those who turned their backs after the guidance had become clear to them, it was Satan who had seduced them, and he had given them [far-flung] hopes"
  47,26,"That is because they said to those who loathed what Allah had sent down: ‘We shall obey you in some matters,’ and Allah knows their secret dealings"
  47,27,"But how will it be [with them] when the angels take them away, striking their faces and their backs"
  47,28,"That, because they pursued what displeased Allah, and loathed His pleasure. So He has made their works fail"
  47,29,Do those in whose hearts is a sickness suppose that Allah will not expose their spite
