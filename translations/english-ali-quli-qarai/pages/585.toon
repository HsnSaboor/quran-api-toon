quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and turned away
  80,2,when the blind man approached him
  80,3,"And how do you know, maybe he would purify himself"
  80,4,"or take admonition, and the admonition would benefit him"
  80,5,But as for someone who is wealthy
  80,6,you attend to him
  80,7,though you are not liable if he does not purify himself
  80,8,But as for someone who comes hurrying to you
  80,9,"while he fears [Allah]"
  80,10,you are neglectful of him
  80,11,"No indeed! These [verses of the Quran ] are a reminder"
  80,12,—so let anyone who wishes remember—
  80,13,in honoured scriptures
  80,14,exalted and purified
  80,15,in the hands of envoys
  80,16,noble and pious
  80,17,Perish man! How ungrateful is he
  80,18,From what did He create him
  80,19,"He created him from a drop of [seminal] fluid; then proportioned him"
  80,20,Then He made the way easy for him
  80,21,then He made him die and buried him
  80,22,"and then, when He wished, resurrected him"
  80,23,No indeed! He has not yet carried out what He has commanded him
  80,24,Let man consider his food
  80,25,"We pour down plenteous water [from the sky]"
  80,26,then We split the earth making fissures in it
  80,27,and make the grain grow in it
  80,28,as well as vines and vegetables
  80,29,olives and date palms
  80,30,and densely-planted gardens
  80,31,fruits and pastures
  80,32,as a sustenance for you and your livestock
  80,33,So when the deafening Cry comes—
  80,34,the day when a man will evade his brother
  80,35,his mother and his father
  80,36,his spouse and his sons—
  80,37,each of them will have a task to keep him preoccupied on that day
  80,38,Some faces will be bright on that day
  80,39,laughing and joyous
  80,40,and some faces on that day will be covered with dust
  80,41,overcast with gloom
  80,42,"It is they who are the faithless, the vicious"
