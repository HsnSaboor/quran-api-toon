quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  56,51,"Then indeed, you, astray deniers"
  56,52,will surely eat from the Zaqqum tree
  56,53,and stuff your bellies with it
  56,54,and drink boiling water on top of it
  56,55,drinking like thirsty camels.’
  56,56,Such will be the hospitality they receive on the Day of Retribution
  56,57,We created you. Then why do you not acknowledge it
  56,58,Have you considered the sperm that you emit
  56,59,"Is it you who create it, or are We the creator"
  56,60,"We have ordained death among you, and We are not to be outmaneuvered"
  56,61,"from replacing you with your likes and recreating you in [a realm] you do not know"
  56,62,"Certainly you have known the first genesis, then why do you not take admonition"
  56,63,Have you considered what you sow
  56,64,"Is it you who make it grow, or are We the grower"
  56,65,"If We wish, We turn it into chaff, whereat you are left stunned [saying to yourselves]"
  56,66,‘Indeed we have suffered loss
  56,67,"No, we are deprived!’"
  56,68,Have you considered the water that you drink
  56,69,"Is it you who bring it down from the rain cloud, or is it We who bring [it] down"
  56,70,If We wish We can make it bitter. Then why do you not give thanks
  56,71,Have you considered the fire that you kindle
  56,72,"Was it you who caused its tree to grow, or were We the grower"
  56,73,It was We who made it a reminder and a boon for the desert-dwellers
  56,74,"So celebrate the Name of your Lord, the All-supreme"
  56,75,I swear by the places where the stars set
  56,76,"And indeed it is a great oath, should you know"
