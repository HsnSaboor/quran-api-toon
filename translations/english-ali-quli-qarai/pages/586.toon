quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun is wound up
  81,2,when the stars scatter
  81,3,when the mountains are set moving
  81,4,when the pregnant camels are neglected
  81,5,when the wild beasts are mustered
  81,6,when the seas are set afire
  81,7,when the souls are assorted
  81,8,when the girl buried-alive will be asked
  81,9,for what sin she was killed
  81,10,"When the records [of deeds] are unfolded"
  81,11,when the sky is stripped off
  81,12,when hell is set ablaze
  81,13,when paradise is brought near
  81,14,"then a soul shall know what it has readied [for itself]"
  81,15,So I swear by the stars that return
  81,16,the comets
  81,17,by the night as it approaches
  81,18,by the dawn as it breathes
  81,19,it is indeed the speech of a noble apostle
  81,20,powerful and eminent with the Lord of the Throne
  81,21,one who is obeyed and is trustworthy as well
  81,22,Your companion is not crazy
  81,23,certainly he saw him on the manifest horizon
  81,24,and he is not miserly concerning the Unseen
  81,25,And it is not the speech of an outcast Satan
  81,26,So where are you going
  81,27,It is just a reminder for all the nations
  81,28,for those of you who wish to walk straight
  81,29,"but you will not wish unless it is wished by Allah, the Lord of all the worlds"
