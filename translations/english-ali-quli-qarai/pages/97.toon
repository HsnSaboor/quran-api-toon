quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"There is no good in much of their secret talks, excepting him who enjoins charity or what is right or reconciliation between people, and whoever does that, seeking Allah’s pleasure, soon We shall give him a great reward"
  4,115,"Whoever defies the Apostle, after the guidance has become manifest to him, and follows a way other than that of the faithful, We shall abandon him to his devices and We shall make him enter hell, and it is an evil destination"
  4,116,"Indeed Allah does not forgive that any partner should be ascribed to Him, but He forgives anything besides that to whomever He wishes. And whoever ascribes partners to Allah has certainly strayed into far error"
  4,117,"They invoke none but females besides Him, and invoke none but a froward Satan"
  4,118,"whom Allah has cursed, and who said, ‘I will surely take of Your servants a settled share"
  4,119,"and I will lead them astray and give them [false] hopes, and prompt them to slit the ears of cattle, and I will prompt them to alter Allah’s creation.’ Whoever takes Satan as a guardian instead of Allah has certainly incurred a manifest loss"
  4,120,"He makes them promises and gives them [false] hopes, yet Satan does not promise them anything but delusion"
  4,121,"The refuge of such shall be hell, and they will not find any escape from it"
