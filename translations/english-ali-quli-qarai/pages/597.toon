quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the fig and the olive
  95,2,by Mount Sinai
  95,3,and by this secure town
  95,4,We certainly created man in the best of forms
  95,5,then We relegated him to the lowest of the low
  95,6,except those who have faith and do righteous deeds. There will be an everlasting reward for them
  95,7,So what makes you deny the Retribution
  95,8,Is not Allah the fairest of all judges
  96,1,Read in the Name of your Lord who created
  96,2,created man from a clinging mass
  96,3,"Read, and your Lord is the most generous"
  96,4,who taught by the pen
  96,5,taught man what he did not know
  96,6,Indeed man becomes rebellious
  96,7,when he considers himself without need
  96,8,Indeed to your Lord is the return
  96,9,"Tell me, he who forbids"
  96,10,a servant when he prays
  96,11,"tell me, should he be on [true] guidance"
  96,12,"or bid [others] to Godwariness"
  96,13,"tell me, should he call him a liar and turn away"
  96,14,"—does he not know that Allah sees [him]"
  96,15,"No indeed! If he does not cease, We shall seize him by the forelock"
  96,16,"a lying, sinful forelock"
  96,17,Then let him call out his gang
  96,18,"We [too] shall call the keepers of hell"
  96,19,"No indeed! Do not obey him, but prostrate and draw near [to Allah]"
