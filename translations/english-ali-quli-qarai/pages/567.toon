quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  69,9,"Then Pharaoh and those who were before him, and the towns that were overturned, brought about iniquity"
  69,10,"They disobeyed the apostle of their Lord, so He seized them with a terrible seizing"
  69,11,"Indeed when the Flood rose high, We carried you in a floating ark"
  69,12,"that We might make it a reminder for you, and that receptive ears might remember it"
  69,13,When the Trumpet is blown with a single blast
  69,14,and the earth and the mountains are lifted and levelled with a single levelling
  69,15,"then, on that day, will the Imminent [Hour] befall"
  69,16,and the sky will be split open—for it will be frail on that day—
  69,17,"with the angels all over it, and the Throne of your Lord will be borne that day by eight [angels]"
  69,18,"That day you will be presented [before your Lord]: none of your secrets will remain hidden"
  69,19,"As for him who is given his book in his right hand, he will say, ‘Here, take and read my book"
  69,20,"Indeed I knew that I will encounter my account [of deeds].’"
  69,21,So he will have a pleasant life
  69,22,in an elevated garden
  69,23,"whose clusters [of fruits] will be within easy reach"
  69,24,"[He will be told]: ‘Enjoy your food and drink, for what you had sent in advance in past days [for your future life].’"
  69,25,"But as for him who is given his book in his left hand, he will say, ‘I wish I had not been given my book"
  69,26,nor had I ever known what my account is
  69,27,I wish death had been the end of it all
  69,28,My wealth did not avail me
  69,29,My authority has left me.’
  69,30,"[The angels will be told:] ‘Seize him, and fetter him"
  69,31,Then put him into hell
  69,32,"Then bind him in a chain, seventy cubits in length"
  69,33,"Indeed he had no faith in Allah, the All-supreme"
  69,34,and he did not urge the feeding of the needy
