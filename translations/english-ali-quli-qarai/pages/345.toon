quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,43,No nation can advance its time nor can it defer it
  23,44,"Then We sent Our apostles successively. Whenever there came to a nation its apostle, they impugned him, so We made them follow one another [to extinction] and We turned them into folktales. So away with the faithless lot"
  23,45,"Then We sent Moses and Aaron, his brother, with Our signs and a manifest authority"
  23,46,to Pharaoh and his elites; but they acted arrogantly and they were a tyrannical lot
  23,47,"They said, ‘Shall we believe two humans like ourselves, while their people are our slaves?’"
  23,48,"So they impugned the two of them, whereat they were among those who were destroyed"
  23,49,Certainly We gave Moses the Book so that they might be guided
  23,50,"and We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and sheltered them in a level highland with flowing water"
  23,51,O apostles! Eat of the good things and act righteously. Indeed I know best what you do
  23,52,"Indeed this community of yours is one community, and I am your Lord, so be wary of Me"
  23,53,"But they fragmented their religion among themselves, each party boasting about what it had"
  23,54,So leave them in their stupor for a while
  23,55,"Do they suppose that whatever aid We provide them in regard to wealth and children [is because]"
  23,56,"We are eager to bring them good? No, they are not aware"
  23,57,Indeed those who are apprehensive for the fear of their Lord
  23,58,and believe in the signs of their Lord
  23,59,and do not ascribe partners to their Lord
