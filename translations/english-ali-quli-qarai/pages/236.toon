  12,5,"he said, ‘My son, do not recount your dream to your brothers, lest they should devise schemes against you. Satan is indeed man’s manifest enemy"
  12,6,"That is how your Lord will choose you, and teach you the interpretation of dreams, and complete His blessing upon you and upon the house of Jacob, just as He completed it earlier for your fathers, Abraham and Isaac. Your Lord is indeed all-knowing and all-wise.’"
  12,7,In Joseph and his brothers there are certainly signs for the seekers
  12,8,"When they said, ‘Surely Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than [the rest of] us, though we are a hardy band. Our father is indeed in manifest error.’"
  12,9,"‘Kill Joseph or cast him away into some [distant] land, so that your father’s attention may be exclusively towards you, and thereafter you may become a righteous lot.’"
  12,10,"One of them said, ‘Do not kill Joseph, but cast him into the recess of a well so that some caravan may pick him up, if you are to do [anything].’"
  12,11,"They said, ‘Father! Why is it that you do not trust us with Joseph? We are indeed his well-wishers"
  12,12,"Let him go with us tomorrow so that he may eat lots of fruits and play, and we will indeed take [good] care of him.’"
  12,13,"He said, ‘It really upsets me that you should take him away, and I fear the wolf may eat him while you are oblivious of him.’"
  12,14,"They said, ‘Should the wolf eat him while we are a hardy band, then we will indeed be losers!’"
