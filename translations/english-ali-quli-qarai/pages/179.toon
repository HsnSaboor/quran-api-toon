quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  8,17,"You did not kill them; rather, it was Allah who killed them; and you did not throw when you threw, rather, it was Allah who threw, that He might test the faithful with a good test from Himself. Indeed Allah is all-hearing, all-knowing"
  8,18,"Such is the case, and [know] that Allah undermines the stratagems of the faithless"
  8,19,"If you sought a verdict, the verdict has certainly come to you; and if you cease [your belligerence against the Prophet and his followers], it is better for you, but if you resume, We [too] shall return and your troops will never avail you though they should be ever so many, and [know] that Allah is with the faithful"
  8,20,"O you who have faith! Obey Allah and His Apostle, and do not turn away from him while you hear [him]"
  8,21,"Do not be like those who say, ‘We hear,’ though they do not hear"
  8,22,Indeed the worst of beasts in Allah’s sight are the deaf and dumb who do not exercise their reason
  8,23,"Had Allah known any good in them, He would have surely made them hear, and were He to make them hear, surely they would turn away, being disregardful"
  8,24,O you who have faith! Answer Allah and the Apostle when he summons you to that which will give you life. Know that Allah intervenes between a man and his heart and that toward Him you will be mustered
  8,25,"And beware of a punishment, which shall not visit the wrongdoers among you exclusively, and know that Allah is severe in retribution"
