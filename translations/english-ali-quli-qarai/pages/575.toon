quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Indeed your Lord knows that you stand vigil for nearly two thirds of the night—or [at times] a half or a third of it—along with a group of those who are with you. Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you cannot calculate it [exactly], and so He was lenient toward you. So recite as much of the Quran as is feasible. He knows that some of you will be sick, while others will travel in the land seeking Allah’s bounty, and yet others will fight in the way of Allah. So recite as much of it as is feasible, and maintain the prayer and pay the zakat and lend Allah a good loan. Whatever good you send ahead for your souls you will find it with Allah [in a form] that is better and greater with respect to reward. And plead to Allah for forgiveness; indeed Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful"
  74,1,O you wrapped up in your mantle
  74,2,Rise up and warn
  74,3,Magnify your Lord
  74,4,and purify your clothes
  74,5,and keep away from all impurity
  74,6,Do not grant a favour seeking a greater gain
  74,7,and be patient for the sake of your Lord
  74,8,When the Trumpet will be sounded
  74,9,that will be a day of hardship
  74,10,not at all easy for the faithless
  74,11,"Leave Me [to deal] with him whom I created alone"
  74,12,and furnished him with extensive means
  74,13,"[gave him] sons to be at his side"
  74,14,"and facilitated [all matters] for him"
  74,15,Still he is eager that I should give him more
  74,16,No indeed! He is an obstinate opponent of Our signs
  74,17,Soon I will overwhelm him with hardship
