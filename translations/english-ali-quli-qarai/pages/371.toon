quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,Confer on me a worthy repute among the posterity
  26,85,and make me one of the heirs to the paradise of bliss
  26,86,"Forgive my father, for he is one of those who are astray"
  26,87,Do not disgrace me on the day that they will be resurrected
  26,88,the day when neither wealth nor children will avail
  26,89,"except him who comes to Allah with a sound heart,’"
  26,90,and paradise will be brought near for the Godwary
  26,91,and hell will be brought into view for the perverse
  26,92,"and they shall be told: ‘Where is that which you used to worship"
  26,93,"besides Allah? Do they help you, or do they help each other?’"
  26,94,Then they will be cast into it on their faces—they and the perverse
  26,95,and the hosts of Iblis all together
  26,96,"They will say, as they wrangle in it [together]"
  26,97,"‘By Allah, we had indeed been in manifest error"
  26,98,when we equated you with the Lord of all the worlds
  26,99,No one led us astray except the guilty
  26,100,Now we have no intercessors
  26,101,nor do we have any sympathetic friend
  26,102,"Had there been another turn for us, we would be among the faithful.’"
  26,103,There is indeed a sign in that; but most of them do not have faith
  26,104,"Indeed your Lord is the All-mighty, the All-merciful"
  26,105,The people of Noah impugned the apostles
  26,106,"when Noah, their brother, said to them, ‘Will you not be wary [of Allah]"
  26,107,"Indeed I am a trusted apostle [sent] to you"
  26,108,So be wary of Allah and obey me
  26,109,I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward lies only with the Lord of all the worlds
  26,110,So be wary of Allah and obey me.’
  26,111,"They said, ‘Shall we believe in you, when it is the riffraff who follow you?’"
