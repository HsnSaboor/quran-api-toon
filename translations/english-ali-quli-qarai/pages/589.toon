quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,observing from their couches
  83,36,Have the faithless been requited for what they used to do
  84,1,When the sky is split open
  84,2,and gives ear to its Lord as it should
  84,3,When the earth is spread out
  84,4,"and throws out what is in it, emptying itself"
  84,5,and gives ear to its Lord as it should
  84,6,"O man! You are labouring toward your Lord laboriously, and you will encounter Him"
  84,7,"Then, as for him who is given his record [of deeds] in his right hand"
  84,8,he will receive an easy reckoning
  84,9,and he will return to his folks joyfully
  84,10,But as for him who is given his record from behind his back
  84,11,he will pray for annihilation
  84,12,and enter the Blaze
  84,13,Indeed he used to be joyful among his folk
  84,14,and he thought that he would never return
  84,15,"Yes, his Lord had been watching him"
  84,16,I swear by the evening glow
  84,17,by the night and what it is fraught with
  84,18,by the moon when it blooms full
  84,19,you will surely fare from stage to stage
  84,20,What is the matter with them that they will not believe
  84,21,and will not prostrate when the Quran is recited to them
  84,22,"Indeed, the faithless impugn [the Apostle]"
  84,23,and Allah knows best what they keep to themselves
  84,24,So inform them of a painful punishment
  84,25,"excepting such as are faithful and do righteous deeds: for them there will be an everlasting reward"
