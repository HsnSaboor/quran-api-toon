quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  13,29,"Those who have faith and do righteous deeds—happy are they and good is their [ultimate] destination"
  13,30,"Thus have We sent you to a nation before which many nations have passed away, that you may recite to them what We have revealed to you. Yet they defy the All-beneficent. Say, ‘He is my Lord; there is no god except Him; in Him I have put my trust, and to Him will be my return.’"
  13,31,"If only it were a Quran whereby the mountains could be moved, or the earth could be toured, or the dead could be spoken to.... Indeed, all dispensation belongs to Allah. Have not the faithful yet realised that had Allah wished He would have guided mankind all together? The faithless will continue to be visited by catastrophes because of their doings—or they will land near their habitations—until Allah’s promise comes to pass. Indeed Allah does not break His promise"
  13,32,"Apostles were certainly derided before you. But then I gave respite to those who were faithless, then I seized them; so how was My retribution"
  13,33,"Is He who sustains every soul in spite of what it earns [comparable to the idols]? Yet they ascribe partners to Allah! Say, ‘Name them!’ Will you inform Him concerning something He does not know about on the earth, or concerning [what are] mere words? Indeed, to the faithless, their scheming is presented as decorous, and they have been barred from the [right] way; and whomever Allah leads astray, has no guide"
  13,34,"There is a punishment for them in the life of this world, and the punishment of the Hereafter will surely be harder, and they have no defender against Allah"
