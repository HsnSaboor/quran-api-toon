quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  67,27,"When they see it brought near, the countenances of the faithless will be contorted, and [they will be] told, ‘This is what you were asking for!’"
  67,28,"Say, ‘Tell me, whether Allah destroys me and those who are with me, or He has mercy on us, who will shelter the faithless from a painful punishment?’"
  67,29,"Say, ‘He is the All-beneficent; we have faith in Him, and in Him do we trust. Soon you will know who is in manifest error.’"
  67,30,"Say, ‘Tell me, should your water sink down [into the ground], who will bring you running water?’"
  68,1,Nun. By the Pen and what they write
  68,2,"by your Lord’s blessing, you are not, crazy"
  68,3,and yours indeed will be an everlasting reward
  68,4,and indeed you possess a great character
  68,5,You will see and they will see
  68,6,which one of you is crazy
  68,7,"Indeed your Lord knows best those who stray from His way, and He knows best those who are guided"
  68,8,So do not obey the deniers
  68,9,"who are eager that you should be flexible, so that they [too] may be flexible [towards you]"
  68,10,And do not obey any vile swearer
  68,11,"scandal-monger, talebearer"
  68,12,"hinderer of all good, sinful transgressor"
  68,13,"callous and, on top of that, baseborn"
  68,14,"—[who behaves in such a manner only] because he has wealth and children"
  68,15,"When Our signs are recited to him, he says, ‘Myths of the ancients!’"
