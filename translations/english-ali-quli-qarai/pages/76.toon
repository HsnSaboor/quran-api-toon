quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,195,"Then their Lord answered them, ‘I do not waste the work of any worker among you, whether male or female; you are all on the same footing. So those who migrated and were expelled from their homes, and were tormented in My way, and those who fought and were killed—I will surely absolve them of their misdeeds and I will admit them into gardens with streams running in them, as a reward from Allah, and Allah—with Him is the best of rewards.’"
  3,196,Never be misled by the bustle of the faithless in the towns
  3,197,"It is a trivial enjoyment; then their refuge is hell, and it is an evil resting place"
  3,198,"But those who are wary of their Lord—for them shall be gardens with streams running in them, to remain in them [forever], a hospitality from Allah; and what is with Allah is better for the pious"
  3,199,"Indeed among the People of the Book there are some who have faith in Allah and in what has been sent down to you, and in what has been sent down to them. Humble toward Allah, they do not sell the signs of Allah for a paltry gain. They shall have their reward near their Lord; indeed Allah is swift at reckoning"
  3,200,"O you who have faith! Be patient, stand firm, and close [your] ranks, and be wary of Allah so that you may be felicitous"
