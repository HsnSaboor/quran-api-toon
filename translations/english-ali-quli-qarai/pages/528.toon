quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,"that it is He who created the mates, the male and the female"
  53,46,"from a drop of [seminal] fluid when emitted"
  53,47,that with Him lies the second genesis
  53,48,that it is He who enriches and grants possessions
  53,49,that it is He who is the Lord of Sirius
  53,50,that it is He who destroyed the former ‘Ad
  53,51,"and Thamud, sparing none [of them]"
  53,52,and the people of Noah before that; indeed they were more unjust and rebellious
  53,53,and He overthrew the town that was overturned
  53,54,covering it with what covered it
  53,55,Then which of the bounties of your Lord will you dispute
  53,56,"This is a warner, [in the tradition] of the warners of old"
  53,57,"The Imminent [Hour] is near at hand"
  53,58,There is none who may unveil it besides Allah
  53,59,Will you then wonder at this discourse
  53,60,and laugh and not weep
  53,61,while you remain heedless
  53,62,So prostrate yourselves to Allah and worship Him
  54,1,The Hour has drawn near and the moon is split
  54,2,"If they see a sign, they turn away, and say, ‘An incessant magic!’"
  54,3,"They denied and followed their own desires, and every matter has a setting [appropriate to it]"
  54,4,There have already come to them reports containing admonishment
  54,5,"[and representing] far-reaching wisdom; but warnings are of no avail"
  54,6,So turn away from them! The day when the Caller calls to a dire thing
