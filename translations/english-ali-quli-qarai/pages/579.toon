quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  76,6,"a spring where Allah’s servants will drink, making it gush forth as they please"
  76,7,They fulfill their vows and fear a day whose ill will be widespread
  76,8,"For the love of Him, they feed the needy, the orphan and the prisoner"
  76,9,"[saying,] ‘We feed you only for the sake of Allah. We desire no reward from you, nor thanks"
  76,10,Indeed we fear a frowning and fateful day from our Lord.’
  76,11,"So Allah saved them from that day’s ills and graced them with freshness [on this faces] and joy [in their hearts]"
  76,12,"He rewarded them for their patience with a garden and [garments of] silk"
  76,13,"reclining therein on couches, without facing any [scorching] sun, or [biting] cold"
  76,14,"Its shades will be close over them and its clusters [of fruits] will be hanging low"
  76,15,They will be served around with vessels of silver and goblets of crystal
  76,16,"—crystal of silver— [from] which they will dispense in a precise measure"
  76,17,They will be served therein with a cup of a drink seasoned with Zanjabeel
  76,18,from a spring in it named Salsabeel
  76,19,"They will be waited upon by immortal youths, whom, were you to see them, you will suppose them to be scattered pearls"
  76,20,"As you look on, you will see there bliss and a great kingdom"
  76,21,Upon them will be cloaks of green silk and brocade and they will be adorned with bracelets of silver. Their Lord will give them to drink a pure drink
  76,22,"[They will be told]: ‘This is your reward, and your efforts have been well-appreciated.’"
  76,23,Indeed We have sent down to you the Quran in a gradual descent
  76,24,So submit patiently to the judgement of your Lord and do not obey any sinner or ingrate from among them
  76,25,and celebrate the Name of your Lord morning and evening
