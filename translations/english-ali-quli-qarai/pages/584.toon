quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,when his Lord called out to him in the holy valley of Tuwa
  79,17,"[And said,] ‘Go to Pharaoh, for indeed he has rebelled"
  79,18,"and say, ‘‘Would you purify yourself"
  79,19,"I will guide you to your Lord, that you may fear [Him]?’’ ’"
  79,20,Then he showed him the greatest sign
  79,21,"But he denied, and disobeyed"
  79,22,"Then he turned back, walking swiftly"
  79,23,"and gathered [the people] and proclaimed"
  79,24,"saying, ‘I am your exalted lord!’"
  79,25,So Allah seized him with the punishment of this life and the Hereafter
  79,26,There is indeed a moral in that for someone who fears
  79,27,Is your creation more prodigious or that of the heaven He has built
  79,28,He raised its vault and fashioned it
  79,29,"and darkened its night, and brought forth its forenoon"
  79,30,Thereafter He spread out the earth
  79,31,brought forth from it its water and pastures
  79,32,setting firm the mountains
  79,33,"as a [place of] sustenance for you and your livestock"
  79,34,When the Greatest Catastrophe befalls
  79,35,—the day when man will remember his endeavours
  79,36,and hell is brought into view for those who can see—
  79,37,as for him who has been rebellious
  79,38,and preferred the life of this world
  79,39,his refuge will indeed be hell
  79,40,"But as for him who is awed to stand before his Lord and restrains his soul from [following] desires"
  79,41,his refuge will indeed be paradise
  79,42,"They ask you concerning the Hour, “When will it set in"
  79,43,considering your frequent mention of it?”
  79,44,Its outcome is with your Lord
  79,45,You are only a warner for those who are afraid it
  79,46,"The day they see it, it shall be as if they had not stayed [in the world] except for an evening or forenoon"
