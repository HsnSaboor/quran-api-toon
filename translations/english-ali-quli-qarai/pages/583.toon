quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,Indeed a triumph awaits the Godwary
  78,32,gardens and vineyards
  78,33,and buxom maidens of a like age
  78,34,and brimming cups
  78,35,Therein they shall hear neither vain talk nor lies
  78,36,—a reward and a sufficing bounty from your Lord
  78,37,"the All-beneficent, the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. They will not be able to address Him"
  78,38,"on the day when the Spirit and the angels stand in an array: none shall speak except someone who is permitted by the All-beneficent and says what is rightful"
  78,39,That day is true for certain. So let anyone who wishes take resort with his Lord
  78,40,"Indeed We have warned you of a punishment near at hand—the day when a person will observe what his hands have sent ahead and the faithless one will say, ‘I wish I were dust!’"
  79,1,"By those [angels] who wrest [the soul] violently"
  79,2,"by those who draw [it] out gently"
  79,3,by those who swim smoothly
  79,4,"by those who, racing, take the lead"
  79,5,"by those who direct the affairs [of creatures]"
  79,6,the day when the Quaker quakes
  79,7,and is followed by the Successor
  79,8,hearts will be trembling on that day
  79,9,bearing a humbled look
  79,10,"They will say, ‘Are we being returned to our earlier state"
  79,11,"What, even after we have been decayed bones?!’"
  79,12,"They will say, ‘This is, then, a ruinous return!’"
  79,13,Yet it will be only a single shout
  79,14,"and behold, they will be awake"
  79,15,Did you receive the story of Moses
