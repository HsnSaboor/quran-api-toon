quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,59,"Nothing keeps Us from sending signs except that the former peoples denied them. We gave Thamud the she-camel as an eye-opener, but they wronged her. We do not send the signs except as warning"
  17,60,"When We said to you, ‘Indeed your Lord encircles those people,’ We did not appoint the vision that We showed you except as a tribulation for the people and the tree cursed in the Quran. We warn them, but it only increases them in their outrageous rebellion"
  17,61,"When We said to the angels, ‘Prostrate before Adam,’ they [all] prostrated, but not Iblis: he said, ‘Shall I prostrate before someone whom You have created from clay?’"
  17,62,"Said he, ‘Do You see this one whom You have honoured above me? If You respite me until the Day of Resurrection, I will surely lay my yoke on his progeny, [all] except a few.’"
  17,63,"Said He, ‘Begone! Whoever of them follows you, indeed the hell shall be your requital, an ample reward"
  17,64,"Instigate whomever of them you can with your voice; and rally against them your cavalry and your infantry, and share with them in wealth and children, and make promises to them!’ But Satan promises them nothing but delusion"
  17,65,"‘As for My servants, you shall have no authority over them.’ And your Lord suffices as trustee"
  17,66,"Your Lord is He who drives for you the ships in the sea that you may seek of His bounty. Indeed, He is most merciful to you"
