quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,62,"They swear to you by Allah, to please you; but Allah and His Apostle are worthier that they should please Him, should they be faithful"
  9,63,"Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His Apostle, there awaits him the Fire of hell, to remain in it [forever]? That is the great disgrace"
  9,64,"The hypocrites are apprehensive lest a surah should be sent down against them, informing them about what is in their hearts. Say, ‘Go on deriding. Allah will indeed bring out what you are apprehensive of.’"
  9,65,"If you question them [regarding their conduct], they will surely say, ‘We were just gossiping and amusing ourselves.’ Say, ‘Were you deriding Allah, His signs, and His apostles"
  9,66,"Do not make excuses. You have disbelieved after your faith.’ If We forgive a group among you, We will punish another group, for they have been guilty"
  9,67,"The hypocrites, men and women, are all alike: they bid what is wrong and forbid what is right; and are tight-fisted. They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them. The hypocrites are indeed the transgressors"
  9,68,"Allah has promised the hypocrites, men and women, and the faithless, the Fire of hell, to remain in it [forever]. That suffices them. Allah has cursed them, and there is a lasting punishment for them"
