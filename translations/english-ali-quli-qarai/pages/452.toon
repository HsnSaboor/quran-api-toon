quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you? How do you judge
  37,155,Will you not then take admonition
  37,156,Do you have a manifest authority
  37,157,"Then produce your scripture, should you be truthful"
  37,158,"And they have set up a kinship between Him and the jinn, while the jinn certainly know that they will be presented [before Him]"
  37,159,"Clear is Allah of whatever they allege [about Him]"
  37,160,"—[all] except Allah’s exclusive servants"
  37,161,Indeed you and what you worship
  37,162,"cannot mislead [anyone] about Him"
  37,163,except someone who is bound for hell
  37,164,‘There is none among us but has a known place
  37,165,It is we who are the ranged ones
  37,166,It is we who celebrate Allah’s glory.’
  37,167,"They indeed, used to say"
  37,168,‘Had we possessed a Reminder from our predecessors
  37,169,we would have surely been Allah’s exclusive servants.’
  37,170,"But they disbelieved it [when it came to them]. Soon they will know"
  37,171,"Certainly Our decree has gone beforehand in favour of Our servants, the apostles"
  37,172,"that they will indeed receive [Allah’s] help"
  37,173,and indeed Our hosts will be the victors
  37,174,So leave them alone for a while
  37,175,"and watch them; soon they will see [the truth of the matter]"
  37,176,Do they seek to hasten Our punishment
  37,177,But when it descends in their courtyard it will be a dismal dawn for those who had been warned
  37,178,So leave them alone for a while
  37,179,and watch; soon they will see
  37,180,"Clear is your Lord, the Lord of Might, of whatever they allege [concerning Him]"
  37,181,Peace be to the apostles
  37,182,"All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all the worlds"
