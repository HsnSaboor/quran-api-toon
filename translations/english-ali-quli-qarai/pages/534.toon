quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  55,68,"In both of them will be fruits, date-palms and pomegranates"
  55,69,So which of your Lord’s bounties will you both deny
  55,70,In them are maidens good and lovely
  55,71,So which of your Lord’s bounties will you both deny
  55,72,Houris secluded in pavilions
  55,73,So which of your Lord’s bounties will you both deny
  55,74,"Whom no human has touched before, nor jinn"
  55,75,So which of your Lord’s bounties will you both deny
  55,76,Reclining on green cushions and lovely carpets
  55,77,So which of your Lord’s bounties will you both deny
  55,78,"Blessed is the Name of your Lord, the Majestic and the Munificent"
  56,1,"When the Imminent [Hour] befalls"
  56,2,—there is no denying that it will befall—
  56,3,"[it will be] lowering and exalting"
  56,4,When the earth is shaken violently
  56,5,and the mountains are shattered into bits
  56,6,and become scattered dust
  56,7,you will be three groups
  56,8,The People of the Right Hand—and what are the People of the Right Hand
  56,9,And the People of the Left Hand—and what are the People of the Left Hand
  56,10,And the Foremost Ones are the foremost ones
  56,11,"they are the ones brought near [to Allah]"
  56,12,"[who will reside] in the gardens of bliss"
  56,13,"A multitude from the former [generations]"
  56,14,and a few from the latter ones
  56,15,On brocaded couches
  56,16,"reclining on them, face to face"
