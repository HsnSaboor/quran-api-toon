quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,Indeed those who do not believe in the Hereafter give female names to the angels
  53,28,"They do not have any knowledge of that. They follow nothing but conjectures, and conjecture is no substitute for the truth"
  53,29,So avoid those who turn away from Our remembrance and desire nothing but the life of the world
  53,30,"That is the ultimate reach of their knowledge. Indeed your Lord knows best those who stray from His way, and He knows best those who are [rightly] guided"
  53,31,"To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, that He may requite those who do evil for what they have done, and reward those who do good with the best [of rewards]"
  53,32,"Those who avoid major sins and indecencies, apart from [minor and occasional] lapses. Indeed your Lord is expansive in [His] forgiveness. He knows you best since [the time] He produced you from the earth and since you were foetuses in the bellies of your mothers. So do not flaunt your piety: He knows best those who are Godwary"
  53,33,Did you see him who turned away
  53,34,gave a little and held off
  53,35,Does he have the knowledge of the Unseen so that he sees
  53,36,Has he not been informed of what is in the scriptures of Moses
  53,37,"and of Abraham, who fulfilled [his summons]"
  53,38,that no bearer shall bear another’s burden
  53,39,that nothing belongs to man except what he strives for
  53,40,and that he will soon be shown his endeavour
  53,41,then he will be rewarded for it with the fullest reward
  53,42,that the terminus is toward your Lord
  53,43,"that it is He who makes [men] laugh, and weep"
  53,44,that it is He who brings death and gives life
