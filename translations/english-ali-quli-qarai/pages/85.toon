quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,38,"And those who spend their wealth to be seen by people, and believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. As for him who has Satan for his companion—an evil companion is he"
  4,39,"What harm would it have done them had they believed in Allah and the Last Day, and spent out of what Allah has provided them? Allah knows them well"
  4,40,"Indeed Allah does not wrong [anyone] [even to the extent of] an atom’s weight, and if it be a good deed He doubles it[s reward], and gives from Himself a great reward"
  4,41,"So how shall it be, when We bring a witness from every nation and We bring you as a witness to them"
  4,42,"On that day those who were faithless and [who] disobeyed the Apostle will wish the earth were levelled with them, and they will not conceal any matter from Allah"
  4,43,"O you who have faith! Do not approach prayer when you are intoxicated, [not] until you know what you are saying, nor [enter mosques] in the state of ritual impurity until you have washed yourselves, except while passing through. But if you are sick or on a journey, or any of you has come from the toilet, or you have touched women, and you cannot find water, then make your ablution on clean ground and wipe a part of your faces and your hands. Indeed Allah is all-excusing, all-forgiving"
  4,44,"Have you not regarded those who were given a share of the Book, who purchase error and desire that you [too] should lose the way"
