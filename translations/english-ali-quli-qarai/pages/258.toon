  14,19,"Have you not regarded that Allah created the heavens and the earth with justice? If He wishes, He will take you away, and bring about a new creation"
  14,20,and that is not a formidable thing for Allah
  14,21,"Together they will be presented before Allah. Then those who were weak will say to the arrogant [leaders], ‘Indeed we were your followers. So will you avail us against Allah’s punishment in any wise?’ They will say, ‘Had Allah guided us, surely we would have guided you. It is the same to us whether we are restless or patient: there is no escape for us.’"
  14,22,"When the matter is all over, Satan will say, ‘Indeed Allah made you a promise that was true and I [too] made you a promise, but I failed you. I had no authority over you, except that I called you and you responded to me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves. I cannot respond to your distress calls, neither can you respond to my distress calls. Indeed I disavow your taking me for [Allah’s] partner aforetime. There is indeed a painful punishment for the wrongdoers.’"
  14,23,"Those who have faith and do righteous deeds will be admitted into gardens with streams running in them, to remain in them [forever], by the leave of their Lord. Their greeting therein will be ‘Peace!’"
  14,24,"Have you not regarded how Allah has drawn a parable? A good word is like a good tree: its roots are steady and its branches are in the sky"
