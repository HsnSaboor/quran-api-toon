  39,22,Is someone whose breast Allah has opened to Islam so that he follows a light from His Lord…? So woe to those whose hearts have been hardened to the remembrance of Allah. They are in manifest error

  39,30,"You will die, and they [too] will die"
  39,31,Then on the Day of Resurrection you will contend before your Lord
