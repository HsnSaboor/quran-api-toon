quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,Indeed he reflected and decided
  74,19,"Perish he, how he decided"
  74,20,"Again, perish he, how he decided"
  74,21,Then he looked
  74,22,then frowned and scowled
  74,23,Then he walked away disdainfully
  74,24,"saying, ‘It is nothing but traditional sorcery"
  74,25,It is nothing but the speech of a human.’
  74,26,Soon I will cast him into Saqar
  74,27,And what will show you what is Saqar
  74,28,"It neither spares, nor leaves [anything]"
  74,29,It burns the skin
  74,30,"There are nineteen [keepers] over it"
  74,31,"We have assigned only angels as keepers of the Fire, and We have made their number merely a stumbling block for the faithless, and so that those who were given the Book may be reassured, and the faithful may increase in [their] faith, and so that those who were given the Book and the faithful may not be in doubt, and so that the faithless and those in whose hearts is a sickness may say, ‘What did Allah mean by this description?’ Thus does Allah lead astray whomever He wishes and guides whomever He wishes. No one knows the hosts of your Lord except Him, and it is just an admonition for all humans"
  74,32,No indeed! By the Moon
  74,33,By the night when it recedes
  74,34,By the dawn when it brightens
  74,35,"Indeed they are one of the greatest [signs of God]"
  74,36,—a warner to all humans
  74,37,"[alike] for those of you who like to advance ahead and those who would remain behind"
  74,38,Every soul is hostage to what it has earned
  74,39,except the People of the Right Hand
  74,40,"[They will be] in gardens, questioning"
  74,41,the guilty
  74,42,‘What drew you into Hell?’
  74,43,"They will answer, ‘We were not among those who prayed"
  74,44,Nor did we feed the poor
  74,45,"We used to indulge in [profane] gossip along with the gossipers"
  74,46,and we used to deny the Day of Retribution
  74,47,until death came to us.’
