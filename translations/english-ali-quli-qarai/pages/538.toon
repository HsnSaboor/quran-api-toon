quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  57,4,"It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days; then settled on the Throne. He knows whatever enters the earth and whatever emerges from it and whatever descends from the sky and whatever ascends to it, and He is with you wherever you may be, and Allah watches what you do"
  57,5,"To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and to Allah all matters are returned"
  57,6,"He makes the night pass into the day and makes the day pass into the night, and He knows best what is in the breasts"
  57,7,"Have faith in Allah and His Apostle, and spend out of that of which He has made you heirs. There is a great reward for those of you who have faith and spend [in Allah’s way]"
  57,8,"Why should you not have faith in Allah when the Apostle invites you to have faith in your Lord, and He has certainly made a covenant with you, if you are [genuinely] faithful"
  57,9,"It is He who sends down manifest signs to His servant that He may bring you out of darkness into light, and indeed Allah is most kind and merciful to you"
  57,10,"Why should you not spend in the way of Allah, when to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth? Those of you who spent [their means] and fought before the victory are not equal [to others]. They are greater in rank than those who have spent and fought afterwards. Yet Allah has promised the best reward to each and Allah is well aware of what you do"
  57,11,"Who is it that will lend Allah a good loan, that He may multiply it for him and [that] there may be a noble reward for him"
