  37,108,and left for him a good name in posterity
  37,109,‘Peace be to Abraham!’
  37,110,Thus do We reward the virtuous

  37,118,and guided them to the straight path
  37,119,and left for them a good name in posterity
  37,120,‘Peace be to Moses and Aaron!’
  37,121,Thus indeed do We reward the virtuous
  37,122,They are indeed among Our faithful servants
