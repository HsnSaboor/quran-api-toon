quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,"Not equal are those of the faithful who sit back—excepting those who suffer from some disability—and those who wage jihad in the way of Allah with their possession and their persons.

  4,96,"ranks from Him, forgiveness, and mercy, and Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful"
  4,97,"Indeed, those whom the angels take away while they are wronging themselves, they ask, ‘What state were you in?’ They reply, ‘We were oppressed in the land.’ They say, ‘Was not Allah’s earth vast enough so that you might migrate in it?’ The refuge of such shall be hell, and it is an evil destination"
  4,98,"Except the oppressed among men, women and children, who have neither access to any means nor are guided to any way"
  4,99,"Maybe Allah will excuse them, for Allah is all-excusing, all-forgiving"
  4,100,"Whoever migrates in the way of Allah will find many havens and plenitude in the earth. And whoever leaves his home migrating toward Allah and His Apostle, and is then overtaken by death, his reward shall certainly fall on Allah, and Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful"
  4,101,"When you journey in the land, there is no sin upon you in shortening the prayers, if you fear that the faithless may trouble you; indeed the faithless are your manifest enemies"
