quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By Time
  103,2,Man is indeed in loss
  103,3,"except those who have faith and do righteous deeds, and enjoin one another to [follow] the truth, and enjoin one another to patience"
  104,1,Woe to every scandal-monger and slanderer
  104,2,who amasses wealth and counts it over
  104,3,He supposes his wealth will make him immortal
  104,4,No indeed! He will surely be cast into the Crusher
  104,5,And what will show you what is the Crusher
  104,6,"[It is] the fire of Allah, set ablaze"
  104,7,which will overspread the hearts
  104,8,Indeed it will close in upon them
  104,9,in outstretched columns
  105,1,Have you not regarded how your Lord dealt with the army of the elephants
  105,2,Did He not make their stratagems go awry
  105,3,and send against them flocks of birds
  105,4,pelting them with stones of shale
  105,5,thus making them like chewed-up straw
