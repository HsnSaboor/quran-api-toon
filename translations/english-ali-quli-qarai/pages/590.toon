quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  85,1,By the heaven with its Houses
  85,2,by the Promised Day
  85,3,by the Witness and the Witnessed
  85,4,perish the People of the Ditch
  85,5,The fire abounding in fuel
  85,6,above which they sat
  85,7,as they were themselves witnesses to what they did to the faithful
  85,8,"They were vindictive towards them only because they had faith in Allah, the All-mighty and the All-laudable"
  85,9,"to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is witness to all things"
  85,10,"Indeed those who persecute the faithful, men and women, and do not repent thereafter, there is the punishment of hell for them and the punishment of burning"
  85,11,Indeed those who have faith and do righteous deeds—for them will be gardens with streams running in them. That is the supreme success
  85,12,Indeed your Lord’s striking is severe
  85,13,It is indeed He who originates and brings back
  85,14,"and He is the All-forgiving, the All-affectionate"
  85,15,"Lord of the Throne, the All-glorious"
  85,16,doer of what He desires
  85,17,Did you receive the story of the hosts
  85,18,of Pharaoh and Thamud
  85,19,Indeed the faithless dwell in denial
  85,20,and Allah besieges them from all around
  85,21,Indeed it is a glorious Quran
  85,22,in a preserved tablet
