quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,"Indeed, the record of the vicious is in Sijjeen"
  83,8,And what will show you what is Sijjeen
  83,9,It is a written record
  83,10,Woe to the deniers on that day
  83,11,who deny the Day of Retribution
  83,12,and none denies it except every sinful transgressor
  83,13,"When Our signs are recited to him, he says, ‘Myths of the ancients!’"
  83,14,"No, that is not the case! Rather, their hearts have been sullied by what they have been earning"
  83,15,"Indeed, they will be alienated from their Lord on that day"
  83,16,Afterward they will enter hell
  83,17,"then told, ‘This is what you used to deny!’"
  83,18,"Indeed, the record of the pious is in Illeeyun"
  83,19,And what will show you what is Illeeyun
  83,20,It is a written record
  83,21,"witnessed by those brought near [to Allah]"
  83,22,The pious shall be amid bliss
  83,23,"observing, [as they recline] on couches"
  83,24,You will perceive in their faces the freshness of bliss
  83,25,They will be served with a sealed pure wine
  83,26,whose seal is musk—for such let the viers vie—
  83,27,and whose seasoning is from Tasneem
  83,28,"a spring where those brought near [to Allah] drink"
  83,29,Indeed the guilty used to laugh at the faithful
  83,30,and when they passed them by they would wink at each other
  83,31,and when they returned to their folks they would return amused
  83,32,"and when they saw them they would say, ‘Indeed those are the astray!’"
  83,33,Though they were not sent to watch over them
  83,34,So today the faithful will laugh at the faithless
