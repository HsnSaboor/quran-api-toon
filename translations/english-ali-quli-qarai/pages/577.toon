quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,So the intercession of the intercessors will not avail them
  74,49,What is the matter with them that they evade the Reminder
  74,50,as if they were terrified asses
  74,51,fleeing from a lion
  74,52,"But everyone of them desires to be given unrolled scriptures [from Allah]"
  74,53,"No! Indeed, they do not fear the Hereafter"
  74,54,No! It is indeed a reminder
  74,55,So let anyone who wishes be mindful of it
  74,56,"And they will not be mindful unless Allah wishes. He is worthy of [your] being wary [of Him] and He is worthy to forgive"
  75,1,I swear by the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,And I swear by the self-critical soul
  75,3,"Does man suppose that We will not put together his bones [at resurrection]"
  75,4,"Yes indeed, We are able to [re]shape [even] his fingertips"
  75,5,"Indeed, man desires to go on living viciously"
  75,6,"He asks, ‘When will be this “day of resurrection”?!’"
  75,7,But when the eyes are dazzled
  75,8,the moon is eclipsed
  75,9,and the sun and the moon are brought together
  75,10,"that day man will say, ‘Where is the escape [from this day]?’"
  75,11,No indeed! There will be no refuge
  75,12,"That day the [final] goal will be toward your Lord"
  75,13,"That day man will be informed about what [works] he had sent ahead [to the scene of judgement] and [the legacy that he had] left behind"
  75,14,"Indeed, man is a witness to himself"
  75,15,"though he should offer excuses [to justify his failings]"
  75,16,Do not move your tongue with it to hasten it
  75,17,Indeed it is up to Us to put it together and to recite it
  75,18,"And when We have recited it, follow its recitation"
  75,19,"Then, its exposition [also] lies with Us"
