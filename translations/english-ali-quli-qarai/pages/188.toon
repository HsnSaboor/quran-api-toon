quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,7,"How shall the polytheists have any [valid] treaty with Allah and His Apostle?! (Barring those with whom you made a treaty at the Holy Mosque; so long as they are steadfast with you, be steadfast with them. Indeed Allah loves the Godwary)"
  9,8,"How? For if, they get the better of you, they will observe toward you neither kinship nor covenant. They please you with their mouths while their hearts spurn you; and most of them are transgressors"
  9,9,"They have sold the signs of Allah for a paltry gain, and have barred [the people] from His way. Evil indeed is what they have been doing"
  9,10,"They observe toward a believer neither kinship nor covenant, and it is they who are the transgressors"
  9,11,"Yet if they repent and maintain the prayer and give the zakat, then they are your brethren in faith. We elaborate the signs for a people who have knowledge"
  9,12,"But if they break their pledges after their having made a treaty and revile your religion, then fight the leaders of unfaith—indeed, they have no [commitment to] pledges,—maybe they will desist"
  9,13,"Will you not make war on a people who broke their pledges and resolved to expel the Apostle, and opened [hostilities] against you initially? Do you fear them? But Allah is worthier of being feared by you, should you be faithful"
