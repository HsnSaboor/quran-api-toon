  92,15,"which none shall enter except the most wretched [of persons]"
  92,16,"—he who impugns [God’s prophets] and turns his back"
  92,17,"The Godwary [person] will be spared of that"
  92,18,—he who gives his wealth to purify himself
  92,19,and does not expect any reward from anyone
  92,20,"but seek only the pleasure of their Lord, the Most Exalted"
  92,21,"and, surely, soon they will be well-pleased"
  93,1,By the morning brightness
  93,2,and by the night when it is calm
  93,3,"Your Lord has neither forsaken you, nor is He displeased with you"
  93,4,and the Hereafter shall be better for you than the world
  93,5,"Soon your Lord will give you [that with which] you will be pleased"
  93,6,"Did He not find you an orphan, and shelter you"
  93,7,"Did He not find you astray, and guide you"
  93,8,"Did He not find you needy, and enrich you"
  93,9,"So, as for the orphan, do not oppress him"
  93,10,"and as for the beggar, do not chide him"
  93,11,"and as for your Lord’s blessing, proclaim it"
  94,1,Did We not open your breast for you
  94,2,and relieve you of your burden
  94,3,"which [almost] broke your back"
  94,4,Did We not exalt your name
  94,5,Indeed ease accompanies hardship
  94,6,Indeed ease accompanies hardship
  94,7,"So when you are done, appoint"
  94,8,and supplicate your Lord
