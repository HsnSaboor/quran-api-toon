quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  62,1,"Whatever there is in the heavens and in the earth glorifies Allah, the Sovereign, the All-holy, the All-mighty, the All-wise"
  62,2,"It is He who sent to the unlettered [people] an apostle from among themselves, to recite to them His signs, to purify them, and to teach them the Book and wisdom, and earlier they had indeed been in manifest error"
  62,3,"And to others from among them [as well] who have not yet joined them. And He is the All-mighty, the All-wise"
  62,4,"That is Allah’s grace, which He grants to whomever He wishes, and Allah is dispenser of a great grace"
  62,5,"The example of those who were charged with the Torah, then failed to carry it, is that of an ass carrying books. Evil is the example of the people who deny Allah’s signs, and Allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot"
  62,6,"Say, ‘O Jews! If you claim that you are Allah’s favourites, to the exclusion of other people, then long for death, should you be truthful.’"
  62,7,"Yet they will never long for it, because of what their hands have sent ahead, and Allah knows best the wrongdoers"
  62,8,"Say, ‘The death that you flee will indeed encounter you. Then you will be returned to the Knower of the sensible and the Unseen, and He will inform you about what you used to do.’"
