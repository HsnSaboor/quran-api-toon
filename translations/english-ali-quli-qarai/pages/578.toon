quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,"No! Indeed, you love this transitory life"
  75,21,and forsake the Hereafter
  75,22,Some faces will be fresh on that day
  75,23,looking to their Lord
  75,24,and some faces will be scowling on that day
  75,25,knowing that they will be dealt out a punishment breaking the spine
  75,26,No indeed! When it reaches up to the collar bones
  75,27,"and it is said, ‘Who will take him up?’"
  75,28,"and he knows that it is the [time of] parting"
  75,29,and each shank clasps the other shank
  75,30,that day he shall be driven toward your Lord
  75,31,"He neither confirmed [the messages of Allah], nor did he pray"
  75,32,"but denied [them] and turned away"
  75,33,and went back swaggering to his family
  75,34,"So, woe to you! Woe to you"
  75,35,"Again, woe to you! Woe to you"
  75,36,Does man suppose that he has been abandoned to futility
  75,37,Was he not a drop of emitted semen
  75,38,"and then a clinging mass? Whereat He created and proportioned [him]"
  75,39,"and made of him the two sexes, male and female"
  75,40,"Is not [someone like] that able to revive the dead"
  76,1,Has there been a period of time for man when he was not anything worthy of mention
  76,2,"Indeed We created man from the drop of a mixed fluid so that We may put him to test, so We endowed with hearing and sight"
  76,3,"Indeed We have guided him to the way, be he grateful or ungrateful"
  76,4,"Indeed for the faithless We have prepared chains, iron collars, and a blaze"
  76,5,Indeed the pious will drink from a cup seasoned with Kafur
