quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,"By the heaven, and by the nightly visitor"
  86,2,and what will show you what is the nightly visitor
  86,3,It is the brilliant star
  86,4,there is a guard over every soul
  86,5,So let man consider from what he was created
  86,6,He was created from an effusing fluid
  86,7,which issues from between the loins and the breast-bones
  86,8,"Indeed He is able to bring him back [after death]"
  86,9,on the day when the secrets are examined
  86,10,and he shall have neither power nor helper

  87,10,"he who fears [God] will take admonition"
  87,11,and the most wretched will shun it
  87,12,—he who will enter the Great Fire
  87,13,"then he will neither live in it, nor die"
  87,14,‘Felicitous is he who purifies himself
  87,15,"celebrates the Name of his Lord, and prays"
