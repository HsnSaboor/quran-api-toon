quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"On Him devolves the knowledge of the Hour, and no fruit emerges from its covering and no female conceives or delivers except with His knowledge. On the day when He will call out to them, ‘Where are My ‘partners’?’ They will say, ‘We informed You that there is no witness amongst us.’"
  41,48,"What they used to invoke before has forsaken them, and they know there is no escape for them"
  41,49,"Man is never wearied of supplicating for good, and should any ill befall him, he becomes hopeless and despondent"
  41,50,"If, after distress has befallen him, We let him have a taste of Our mercy, he says, ‘This is my due! I do not think the Hour will ever come, and in case I am returned to my Lord, I will indeed have the best [reward] with Him.’ So We will surely inform the faithless about what they have done, and will surely make them taste a harsh punishment"
  41,51,"When We bless man, he is disregardful and turns aside; but when an ill befalls him, he makes protracted supplications"
  41,52,"Say, ‘Tell me, if it is from Allah and you disbelieve in it, who will be more astray than those who are in extreme defiance.’"
  41,53,Soon We shall show them Our signs in the horizons and in their own souls until it becomes clear to them that He is the Real. Is it not sufficient that your Lord is witness to all things
  41,54,"Indeed, they are in doubt about the encounter with their Lord! Indeed, He embraces all things"
