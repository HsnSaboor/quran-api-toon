quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Have We not created you from a base fluid
  77,21,"[and] then lodged it in a secure abode"
  77,22,"until a known span [of time]"
  77,23,Then We determined; and how excellent determiners We are
  77,24,Woe to the deniers on that day
  77,25,Have We not made the earth a receptacle
  77,26,for the living and the dead
  77,27,"and set in it lofty [and] firm mountains, and given you agreeable water to drink"
  77,28,Woe to the deniers on that day
  77,29,"[The faithless will be told:] ‘Proceed toward what you used to deny"
  77,30,Proceed toward the triple-forked shadow
  77,31,neither shady nor of any avail against the flames
  77,32,"Indeed it throws up [giant] sparks like castles"
  77,33,"[bright] like yellow camels"
  77,34,Woe to the deniers on that day
  77,35,This is a day wherein they will not speak
  77,36,nor will they be permitted to offer excuses
  77,37,Woe to the deniers on that day
  77,38,‘This is the Day of Judgement. We have brought you together with the former generations
  77,39,"If you have any stratagems [left], try them out against Me!’"
  77,40,Woe to the deniers on that day
  77,41,Indeed the Godwary will be amid shades and springs
  77,42,"and [enjoying] such fruits as they desire"
  77,43,"[They will be told:] ‘Enjoy your food and drink, [a reward] for what you used to do"
  77,44,Thus do We reward the virtuous.’
  77,45,Woe to the deniers on that day
  77,46,‘Eat and enjoy a little! You are indeed guilty.’
  77,47,Woe to the deniers on that day
  77,48,"When they are told, ‘Bow down [in prayer],’ they do not bow down"
  77,49,Woe to the deniers on that day
  77,50,So what discourse will they believe after this
