quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  42,32,"Among His signs are the ships [that run] on the sea [appearing] like landmarks"
  42,33,"If He wishes He stills the wind, whereat they remain standstill on its surface. There are indeed signs in that for every patient and grateful [servant]"
  42,34,"Or He wrecks them because of what they have earned, and He excuses many [an offense]"
  42,35,Let those who dispute Our signs know that there is no escape for them
  42,36,"Whatever you have been given are the wares of the life of this world, but what is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who have faith and who put their trust in their Lord"
  42,37,"—those who avoid major sins and indecencies, and forgive when angered"
  42,38,"those who answer their Lord, maintain the prayer, and [conduct] their affairs by counsel among themselves, and they spend out of what We have provided them"
  42,39,"those who, when afflicted by oppression, defend themselves"
  42,40,"The requital of evil is an evil like it, so whoever excuses and conciliates, his reward lies with Allah. Indeed, He does not like the wrongdoers"
  42,41,"As for those who retaliate after being wronged, there is no ground for action against them"
  42,42,The ground for action is only against those who oppress the people and commit tyranny in the land in violation of justice. For such there will be a painful punishment
  42,43,As for someone who endures patiently and forgives—that is indeed the steadiest of courses
  42,44,"Those whom Allah leads astray have no guardian apart from Him. You will see the wrongdoers, when they sight the punishment, saying, ‘Is there any way for a retreat?’"
