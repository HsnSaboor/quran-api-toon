quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,A sign for them is that We carried their progeny in the laden ship
  36,42,"and We have created for them what is similar to it, which they ride"
  36,43,"And if We like We drown them, whereat they have no one to call for help, nor are they rescued"
  36,44,except by a mercy from Us and for an enjoyment until some time
  36,45,"And when they are told, ‘Beware of that which is before you and that which is behind you, so that you may receive [His] mercy…’"
  36,46,There does not come to them any sign from among the signs of their Lord but that they have been disregarding it
  36,47,"When they are told, ‘Spend out of what Allah has provided you,’ the faithless say to the faithful, ‘Shall we feed [someone] whom Allah would feed, if He wished? You are only in manifest error.’"
  36,48,"And they say, ‘When will this promise be fulfilled, should you be truthful?’"
  36,49,They do not await but a single Cry that will seize them as they wrangle
  36,50,"Then they will not be able to make any will, nor will they return to their folks"
  36,51,"And when the Trumpet is blown, behold, there they will be, scrambling towards their Lord from their graves"
  36,52,"They will say, ‘Woe to us! Who raised us from our place of sleep?’ ‘This is what the All-beneficent had promised, and the apostles had spoken the truth!’"
  36,53,"It will be but a single Cry, and, behold, they will all be presented before Us"
  36,54,"‘Today no soul will be wronged in the least, nor will you be requited except for what you used to do.’"
