quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,What is it that they are questioning each other about
  78,2,"[Is it] about the Great Tiding"
  78,3,the one about which they differ
  78,4,No indeed! Soon they will know
  78,5,No indeed! Soon they will know for once again
  78,6,Did We not make the earth a resting place
  78,7,and the mountains stakes
  78,8,and create you in pairs
  78,9,and make your sleep for rest
  78,10,and make the night a covering
  78,11,and make the day for livelihood
  78,12,and build above you the seven mighty heavens
  78,13,"and make [the sun for] a radiant lamp"
  78,14,and send down water pouring from the rain-clouds
  78,15,that We may bring forth with it grains and plants
  78,16,and luxuriant gardens
  78,17,Indeed the Day of Judgement is the tryst
  78,18,"the day the Trumpet will be blown, and you will come in groups"
  78,19,and the sky will be opened and become gates
  78,20,and the mountains will be set moving and become a mirage
  78,21,Indeed hell is in ambush
  78,22,a resort for the rebels
  78,23,to reside therein for ages
  78,24,tasting in it neither any coolness nor drink
  78,25,except boiling water and pus
  78,26,a fitting requital
  78,27,Indeed they did not expect any reckoning
  78,28,and they denied Our signs mendaciously
  78,29,and We have figured everything in a Book
  78,30,"So [now] taste! We shall increase you in nothing but punishment"
