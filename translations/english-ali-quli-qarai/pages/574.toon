quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  73,1,O you wrapped up in your mantle
  73,2,"Stand vigil through the night, except for a little [of it]"
  73,3,"a half, or reduce a little from that"
  73,4,"or add to it, and recite the Quran in a measured tone"
  73,5,Indeed soon We shall cast on you a weighty discourse
  73,6,Indeed the watch of the night is firmer in tread and more upright in respect to speech
  73,7,for indeed during the day you have drawn-out engagements
  73,8,So celebrate the Name of your Lord and dedicate yourself to Him with total dedication
  73,9,"Lord of the east and the west, there is no god except Him; so take Him for your trustee"
  73,10,"and be patient over what they say, and distance yourself from them in a graceful manner"
  73,11,"Leave Me [to deal] with the deniers, the opulent, and give them a little respite"
  73,12,Indeed with Us are heavy fetters and a fierce fire
  73,13,"and a food that chokes [those who eat it], and a painful punishment [prepared for]"
  73,14,"the day when the earth and the mountains will quake, and the mountains will be like dunes of shifting sand"
  73,15,"Indeed We have sent to you an apostle, to be a witness to you, just as We sent an apostle to Pharaoh"
  73,16,But Pharaoh disobeyed the apostle; so We seized him with a terrible seizing
  73,17,"So, if you disbelieve, how will you avoid the day, which will make children white-headed"
  73,18,and wherein the sky will be rent apart? His promise is bound to be fulfilled
  73,19,This is indeed a reminder. So let anyone who wishes take the way toward his Lord
