quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,137,These are nothing but the traditions of the ancients
  26,138,and we will not be punished.’
  26,139,"So they impugned him, whereupon We destroyed them. There is indeed a sign in that; but most of them do not have faith"
  26,140,"Indeed your Lord is the All-mighty, the All-merciful"
  26,141,"[The people of] Thamud impugned the apostles"
  26,142,"when Salih, their brother, said to them, ‘Will you not be wary [of Allah]"
  26,143,"Indeed I am a trusted apostle [sent] to you"
  26,144,So be wary of Allah and obey me
  26,145,I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward lies only with the Lord of all the worlds
  26,146,Will you be left secure in that which is here
  26,147,—amid gardens and springs
  26,148,farms and date palms with dainty spathes
  26,149,—while you skillfully hew out houses from the mountains
  26,150,So be wary of Allah and obey me
  26,151,and do not obey the dictates of the transgressors
  26,152,who cause corruption in the land and do not bring about reform.’
  26,153,"They said, ‘Indeed you are one of the bewitched"
  26,154,"You are just a human being like us. So bring us a sign, should you be truthful.’"
  26,155,"He said, ‘This is a she-camel; she shall drink and you shall drink on known days"
  26,156,"Do not cause her any harm, for then you shall be seized by the punishment of a terrible day.’"
  26,157,"But they hamstrung her, whereupon they became regretful"
  26,158,So the punishment seized them. There is indeed a sign in that; but most of them do not have faith
  26,159,"Indeed your Lord is the All-mighty, the All-merciful"
