quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  31,12,"And indeed We gave Luqman wisdom: “Give thanks to God!” And whosoever gives thanks, he gives thanks for his own sake. And whosoever is ungrateful, truly God is Self-Sufficient, Praised"
  31,13,"And behold, Luqman said to his son, admonishing him, “O my son! Do not ascribe partners unto God. Truly ascribing partners is a tremendous wrong.”"
  31,14,"And We have enjoined man concerning his parents—his mother bore him, weakness upon weakness, and his weaning was two years—give thanks unto Me and unto your parents. Unto Me is the journey’s end"
  31,15,"But if they strive to make you ascribe as a partner unto Me that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Consort with them in the world in a kindly manner, and follow the way of those who turn in repentance unto Me. Then unto Me is your return, and I shall inform you of that which you used to do"
  31,16,"“O my son! If it be but the weight of a mustard seed, be it in a rock, in the heavens, or on the earth, God will bring it forth. Truly God is Subtle, Aware"
  31,17,"O my son! Perform the prayer, enjoin right and forbid wrong, and bear patiently whatever may befall you. That is indeed a course worthy of resolve"
  31,18,"And turn not your cheek at men in scorn, nor walk exultantly upon the earth. Surely God loves not any vainglorious boaster"
  31,19,And be moderate in thy pace and lower thy voice. Truly the vilest of voices are those of asses.”
