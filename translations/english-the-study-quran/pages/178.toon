  8,9,"When you sought succor from your Lord, He responded to you, “I shall aid you with a thousand angels rank upon rank.”"
  8,10,"And God made it not save as a glad tiding, and that your hearts may be at peace thereby. And victory comes from God alone; truly God is Mighty, Wise"
  8,11,"Behold, He covered you with sleepiness, security from Him, and sent down upon you water from the sky to purify you thereby, to remove the defilement of Satan from you, to fortify your hearts, and to make firm your steps thereby"
  8,12,"Behold, thy Lord revealed unto the angels, “Truly I am with you; so make firm those who believe. I shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. So strike above the neck, and strike their every fingertip.”"
  8,13,That is because they are in schism with God and His Messenger. And whosoever opposes God and His Messenger—truly God is severe in retribution
  8,14,"Thus it is, so taste it, and [know] that the disbelievers shall have the punishment of the Fire"
  8,15,"O you who believe! When you meet those who disbelieve arrayed [for battle], turn not your backs to them"
  8,16,And whosoever turns his back to them that day—unless it be a stratagem of battle or to withdraw to another company—shall certainly earn wrath from God. And his refuge shall be Hell. What an evil journey’s end
