quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,30,"On the Day when every soul will find presented the good it did, and the evil it did, it will wish that there might be a distant term between it and itself. And God warns you of Himself, and God is Kind unto His servants"
  3,31,"Say, “If you love God, follow me, and God will love you and forgive you your sins. And God is Forgiving, Merciful.”"
  3,32,"Say, “Obey God and obey the Messenger.” If they turn away, then truly God loves not the disbelievers"
  3,33,"Truly God chose Adam, Noah, the House of Abraham, and the House of ?Imran above the worlds"
  3,34,"as progeny, one from another. And God is Hearing, Knowing"
  3,35,"[Remember] when the wife of ?Imran said, “My Lord, truly I dedicate to Thee what is in my belly, in consecration. So accept it from me. Truly Thou art the Hearing, the Knowing.”"
  3,36,"And when she bore her, she said, “My Lord, I have borne a female,” and God knows best what she bore, and the male is not like the female, “and I have named her Mary, and I seek refuge for her in Thee, and for her progeny, from Satan the outcast.”"
  3,37,"So her Lord accepted her with a beautiful acceptance, and made her to grow in a beautiful way, and placed her under the care of Zachariah. Whenever Zachariah entered upon her in the sanctuary he found provision with her. He said, “Mary, whence comes this unto thee?” She said, “It is from God. Truly God provides for whomsoever He will without reckoning.”"
