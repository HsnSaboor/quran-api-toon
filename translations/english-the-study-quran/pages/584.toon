quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,when his Lord called out to him in the holy valley of ?uwa
  79,17,“Go unto Pharaoh! Truly he has rebelled
  79,18,"And say, ‘Dost thou wish to be purified"
  79,19,and that I guide thee to thy Lord that thou mightest have fear?’”
  79,20,Then he showed him the greatest sign
  79,21,But he denied and disobeyed
  79,22,"Then turned his back, moving swiftly"
  79,23,Then he gathered and proclaimed
  79,24,"and said, “I am your lord most high.”"
  79,25,So God seized him with a punishment exemplary in the Hereafter and in this world
  79,26,Truly in that is a lesson for whosoever fears
  79,27,Are you more difficult to create or the sky that He has built
  79,28,He raised high its canopy and fashioned it
  79,29,"darkened its night, and brought forth its day"
  79,30,And after that He spread out the earth
  79,31,From it He brought forth its water and its pastures
  79,32,and the mountains He set firm
  79,33,as sustenance for you and for your flocks
  79,34,So when the Great Calamity befalls—
  79,35,a day when man shall remember that for which he endeavored
  79,36,and Hellfire is made visible for one who sees—
  79,37,as for one who rebels
  79,38,and prefers the life of this world
  79,39,truly Hellfire is the refuge
  79,40,As for one who fears standing before his Lord and forbids the soul from caprice
  79,41,truly the Garden is the refuge
  79,42,"They ask thee about the Hour, “When shall it set in?”"
  79,43,What hast thou to do with mentioning it
  79,44,"Unto thy Lord is [knowledge of] the end thereof"
  79,45,Thou art but a warner for whosoever fears it
  79,46,"The Day they see it, it will be as if they had tarried but an evening or the morning thereof"
