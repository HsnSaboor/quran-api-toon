  34,24,"Say, “Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?” Say, “God. And surely either we or you are upon guidance or in manifest error.”"
  34,25,"Say, “You will not be questioned concerning that of which we were guilty; nor will we be questioned concerning what you do.”"
  34,26,"Say, “Our Lord will gather us together; then He will decide between us with truth; and He is the Arbiter, the Knower.”"
  34,27,"Say, “Show me those whom you have joined with Him as partners. Nay! Rather, He is God, the Mighty, the Wise.”"
  34,28,"And We sent thee not, save as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner to mankind entire. But most of mankind know not"
  34,29,"And they say, “When will this promise come to pass, if you are truthful?”"
  34,30,"Say, “Yours shall be the tryst of a Day that you cannot delay by a single hour, nor advance.”"
  34,31,"The disbelievers say, “We shall not believe in this Quran, nor in that which was before it.” Couldst thou but see when the wrongdoers are made to stand before their Lord, hurling reproach upon one another! Those who had been weak and oppressed will say to those who had waxed arrogant, “If not for you, we would have been believers.”"
