quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the fig and the olive
  95,2,by Mount Sinai
  95,3,and by this land made safe
  95,4,truly We created man in the most beautiful stature
  95,5,then We cast him to the lowest of the low
  95,6,save those who believe and perform righteous deeds; for theirs shall be a reward unceasing
  95,7,What then will make you deny religion
  95,8,Is not God the most just of judges
  96,1,Recite in the Name of thy Lord Who created
  96,2,created man from a blood clot
  96,3,Recite! Thy Lord is most noble
  96,4,Who taught by the Pen
  96,5,taught man that which he knew not
  96,6,"Nay, truly man is rebellious"
  96,7,in that he considers himself beyond need
  96,8,Truly unto thy Lord is the return
  96,9,Hast thou seen him who prohibits
  96,10,a slave when he prays
  96,11,Hast thou seen if he does so out of guidance
  96,12,or to enjoin reverence
  96,13,Hast thou seen if he denied and turned away
  96,14,Does he not know that God sees
  96,15,"Nay, but if he ceases not, We shall surely seize him by the forelock—"
  96,16,"a lying, iniquitous forelock"
  96,17,So let him call his cohorts
  96,18,We shall call the guards of Hell
  96,19,Nay! Obey him not! But prostrate and draw nigh
