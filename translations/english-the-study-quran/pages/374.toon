quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,The people of Lot denied the messengers
  26,161,"when their brother Lot said unto them, “Will you not be reverent"
  26,162,Truly I am a trustworthy messenger unto you
  26,163,so reverence God and obey me
  26,164,And I ask not of you any reward for it; my reward lies only with the Lord of the worlds
  26,165,Among all creatures do you come unto males
  26,166,"leaving your spouses your Lord created for you? Nay, but you are a transgressing people.”"
  26,167,"They said, “If you cease not, O Lot, you will be among those who are expelled.”"
  26,168,"He said, “Truly I am of those who detest what you do"
  26,169,My Lord! Deliver me and my family from what they do.”
  26,170,So We delivered him and his family all together
  26,171,save for an old woman among those who lagged behind
  26,172,Then We destroyed the others
  26,173,And We rained a rain upon them. Evil was the rain of the warned
  26,174,"Truly in that is a sign, but most of them are not believers"
  26,175,"And truly thy Lord is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,176,The inhabitants of the thicket denied the messengers
  26,177,"when Shu?ayb said unto them, “Will you not be reverent"
  26,178,Truly I am a trustworthy messenger unto you
  26,179,So reverence God and obey me
  26,180,And I ask not of you any reward for it; my reward lies only with the Lord of the worlds
  26,181,"Give full measure, and be not among those who fall short"
  26,182,Weigh with the right balance
  26,183,"and diminish not people’s goods, nor behave wickedly upon the earth, working corruption"
