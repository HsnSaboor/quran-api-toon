quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  56,51,Then indeed you—O you straying deniers—
  56,52,shall eat from a tree of Zaqqum
  56,53,and fill your bellies therewith
  56,54,Then you shall drink from boiling liquid
  56,55,drinking as do parched camels
  56,56,This shall be their welcome on the Day of Judgment
  56,57,We created you. Would that you affirm it
  56,58,Have you considered that which you emit
  56,59,Is it you who created it or are We the creators
  56,60,"We have decreed death among you, and none outstrips Us"
  56,61,"in replacing [you with] your likenesses and bringing you into being again in what you know not"
  56,62,"You have indeed known the first genesis. Why, then, do you not reflect"

  56,72,"Is it you who brought into being the tree thereof, or is it We Who bring into being"
  56,73,We made it a reminder and an enjoyment for the desert dwellers
  56,74,"So glorify the Name of thy Lord, the Magnificent"
  56,75,I swear by the places where the stars descend
  56,76,"And truly it is a magnificent oath, if you but knew"
