quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,Nay! But you love the ephemeral
  75,21,and forsake the Hereafter
  75,22,Faces that Day shall be radiant
  75,23,gazing upon their Lord
  75,24,And faces that Day shall be scowling
  75,25,knowing that a spine-crushing calamity will befall them
  75,26,Nay! But when it reaches the collarbones
  75,27,"and it is said, “Who will [make him] ascend?”"
  75,28,And he knows for certain that it is the parting
  75,29,and the shank is intertwined with the shank
  75,30,Unto thy Lord that Day is the driving
  75,31,For he neither confirmed nor prayed
  75,32,but he denied and turned away
  75,33,then went to his people swaggering
  75,34,So nearer to you! And nearer
  75,35,Then nearer to you! And nearer
  75,36,Does man suppose that he would be left aimless
  75,37,Was he not a drop of semen emitted
  75,38,"Then he was a blood clot; whereupon He created, then fashioned"
  75,39,"and made from him the two genders, male and female"
  75,40,Is not such a one able to give life to the dead
  76,1,Has there come upon man a span of time in which he was a thing unremembered
  76,2,"Truly We created man from a drop of mixed fluid that We may test him, and We endowed him with hearing, seeing"
  76,3,"Truly We guided him upon the way, be he grateful or ungrateful"
  76,4,"We have surely prepared for the disbelievers chains, shackles, and a blazing flame"
  76,5,Truly the pious drink of a cup mixed with camphor
