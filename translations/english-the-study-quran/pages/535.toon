quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,Immortal youths wait upon them
  56,18,"with goblets, ewers, and a cup from a flowing spring"
  56,19,wherefrom they suffer neither headache nor stupefaction
  56,20,with fruits as they choose
  56,21,and the meat of birds as they desire
  56,22,"and [there shall be] wide-eyed maidens"
  56,23,the likeness of concealed pearls
  56,24,as a recompense for that which they used to do
  56,25,"They hear no idle talk therein, nor incitement to sin"
  56,26,save that “Peace! Peace!” is uttered
  56,27,And the companions of the right; what of the companions of the right
  56,28,Among thornless lote trees
  56,29,clustered plantains
  56,30,and extended shade
  56,31,gushing water
  56,32,and abundant fruit
  56,33,"neither out of reach, nor forbidden"
  56,34,"and [upon] raised beds"
  56,35,"Truly We brought them into being as a [new] creation"
  56,36,then made for them virgins
  56,37,amorous peers
  56,38,for the companions of the right—
  56,39,many from those of old
  56,40,and many from those of later times
  56,41,And the companions of the left; what of the companions of the left
  56,42,Amidst scorching wind and boiling liquid
  56,43,and the shadow of black smoke
  56,44,neither cool nor refreshing
  56,45,Truly before that they lived in luxury
  56,46,would persist in great sin
  56,47,"and would say, “What! When we are dead and have become dust and bones, are we to be resurrected"
  56,48,What! And our fathers of old?”
  56,49,"Say, “Truly those of old and those of later times"
  56,50,are gathered for the tryst of a day appointed.”
