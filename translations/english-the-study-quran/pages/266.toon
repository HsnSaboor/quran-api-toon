quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  15,71,"He said, “These are my daughters, if you must act.”"
  15,72,"By thy life, they wandered confused in their drunkenness"
  15,73,So the Cry seized them at sunrise
  15,74,"then We made its uppermost to be its lowermost, and We rained down upon them stones of baked clay"
  15,75,Truly in that are signs for those who discern
  15,76,and verily they are on a path still standing
  15,77,Truly in that is a sign for the believers
  15,78,And verily the inhabitants of the thicket were wrongdoers

  15,81,"And We gave them Our signs, but they used to turn away therefrom"
  15,82,"And they would hew dwellings in the mountains, [feeling] secure"

  15,86,Truly thy Lord is the knowing Creator
  15,87,"And We have indeed given thee the seven oft-repeated, and the Mighty Quran"
  15,88,"Strain not thine eyes toward the enjoyments We have bestowed upon certain classes of them, and grieve not for them, and lower thy wing unto the believers"
  15,89,"and say, “Truly I am the clear warner.”"
  15,90,Such as We have sent down for those who make division
