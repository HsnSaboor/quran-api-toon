quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  69,9,"And Pharaoh and those before him, and those subverted brought iniquity"
  69,10,"They disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, and He seized them with a devastating blow"
  69,11,"Truly when the waters overflowed, We carried you upon the ship"
  69,12,"that We might make it a reminder for you, and that attentive ears might take heed"
  69,13,Then when a single blast is blown in the trumpet
  69,14,and the earth and mountains are borne away and ground up in a single grinding
  69,15,on that Day the Event shall befall
  69,16,the sky shall be rent asunder; for that Day it shall be frail
  69,17,And the angels shall be at its sides; that Day eight shall carry the Throne of thy Lord above them
  69,18,That Day you shall be exposed; no secret of yours shall be hidden
  69,19,"As for one who is given his book in his right hand, he will say, “Here, read my book"
  69,20,Truly I knew for certain that I would meet my reckoning.”
  69,21,So he shall enjoy a life contenting
  69,22,in a lofty Garden
  69,23,with low-hanging clusters
  69,24,Eat and drink in enjoyment for that which you did in the past in days gone by
  69,25,"And as for one who is given his book in his left hand, he will say, “Would that I had not been given my book"
  69,26,And did not know of my reckoning
  69,27,Would that it were the final end
  69,28,My wealth availed me not
  69,29,My power has passed from me.”
  69,30,Take him and shackle him
  69,31,Then cast him in Hellfire
  69,32,Then put him in a chain whose length is seventy cubits
  69,33,Truly he did not believe in God the Magnificent
  69,34,and did not urge feeding the indigent
