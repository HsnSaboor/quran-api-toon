quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,"Nay, but you prefer the life of this world"
  87,17,while the Hereafter is better and more enduring
  87,18,Truly this is in the scriptures of old
  87,19,the scriptures of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Hast thou heard tell of the overwhelming event
  88,2,Faces that Day shall be humbled
  88,3,"toiling, weary"
  88,4,entering a scorching Fire
  88,5,given drink from a boiling spring
  88,6,"They will have no food, save a vile thorn"
  88,7,which neither nourishes nor avails against hunger
  88,8,Faces that Day shall be blessed
  88,9,contented by their endeavoring
  88,10,in a lofty Garden
  88,11,wherein they hear no idle talk
  88,12,Therein lies a flowing spring
  88,13,therein are raised couches
  88,14,goblets placed
  88,15,cushions arrayed
  88,16,and carpets spread
  88,17,"Do they not consider the camels, how they are created"
  88,18,"the sky, how it is raised"
  88,19,"the mountains, how they are established"
  88,20,"and the earth, how it is spread"
  88,21,So remind! Thou art but a reminder
  88,22,thou art not a warder over them
  88,23,But whosoever turns away and disbelieves
  88,24,God shall punish him with the greatest punishment
  88,25,Truly unto Us is their return
  88,26,then truly with Us lies their reckoning
