quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  67,1,"Blessed is He in Whose Hand lies sovereignty, and He is Powerful over all things"
  67,2,"Who created death and life that He may try you as to which of you is most virtuous in deed, and He is the Mighty, the Forgiving"
  67,3,Who created seven heavens one upon another; no disproportion dost thou see in the Merciful’s creation. Cast thy sight again; dost thou see any flaw
  67,4,Then cast thy sight twice again; thy sight will return to thee humbled and wearied
  67,5,Truly We have adorned the lowest heaven with lamps and made them missiles against the satans; and We have prepared for them the punishment of the Blaze
  67,6,And for those who disbelieve in their Lord is the punishment of Hell. What an evil journey’s end
  67,7,"When they are cast therein, they will hear it blaring as it boils over"
  67,8,"well-nigh bursting with rage. Whenever a group is cast therein, its keepers ask them, “Did not a warner come unto you?”"
  67,9,"They say, “Indeed, a warner came unto us, but we denied him and said, ‘God did not send anything down; you are in naught but great error.’”"
  67,10,"They say, “Had we listened or had we understood, we would not be among the inhabitants of the Blaze.”"
  67,11,Thus do they admit their sin; so away with the inhabitants of the Blaze
  67,12,Truly for those who fear their Lord unseen there shall be forgiveness and a great reward
