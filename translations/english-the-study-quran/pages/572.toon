quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  72,1,"Say, “It was revealed unto me that a group of jinn listened, and said, ‘Truly we have heard a wondrous Quran"
  72,2,that guides to sound judgment; so we believe in it and will ascribe none as partner unto our Lord
  72,3,And He—exalted be the Majesty of our Lord—has neither consort nor child
  72,4,Truly the fool among us has uttered outrages against God
  72,5,though we had thought that mankind and jinn would not utter lies regarding God
  72,6,"Indeed, individuals among mankind did seek refuge with individuals among the jinn, and so increased them in oppression"
  72,7,"They thought, as did you, that God would resurrect no one"
  72,8,We reached out to Heaven and found it filled with mighty sentries and flaming stars
  72,9,"We used to sit in places thereof to listen, but whosoever listens now finds a flaming star lying in wait for him"
  72,10,"We do not know whether evil is desired for those upon the earth, or whether their Lord desires guidance for them"
  72,11,"Some among us are righteous, and some among us are otherwise; we are on paths divided"
  72,12,We knew for certain that we could never thwart God on earth; nor could we ever thwart Him by fleeing
  72,13,"And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it, for whosoever believes in his Lord shall fear neither detraction nor oppression"
