quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  42,32,Among His signs are the ships upon the sea like mountains
  42,33,"if He so wills, He stills the wind, and they lie motionless upon its surface. Truly in that are signs for all who are patient, thankful"
  42,34,Or He causes them to perish for that which they have earned—and He pardons much—
  42,35,and so that those who dispute concerning Our signs will know that they have no refuge
  42,36,"Whatsoever you have been given, it is the enjoyment of the life of this world, and that which lies with God is better and more lasting for those who believe and trust in their Lord"
  42,37,"who shun grave sins and indecencies and who when they are angry, they forgive"
  42,38,"who respond to their Lord and perform the prayer, their affair being counsel among them, who spend from that which We have provided them"
  42,39,"and who, when tyranny befalls them, they defend themselves"
  42,40,"The recompense of an evil is an evil like unto it. Yet whosoever pardons and sets matters aright, his reward is with God. Truly He loves not the wrongdoers"
  42,41,"And whosoever defends himself after having been wronged, for such there is no way against them"
  42,42,"There is only a way against those who wrong people and behave tyrannically upon the earth without right. For them, there shall be a painful punishment"
  42,43,"And whosoever is patient and forgives, that is indeed a course worthy of resolve"
  42,44,"And whomsoever God leads astray has no protector beyond Him. Thou shalt see the wrongdoers, when they see the punishment, saying, “Is there any way of return?”"
