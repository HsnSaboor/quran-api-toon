quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  43,11,"Who sent down water from the sky in due measure, whereby We revived a dead land—thus shall you be brought forth"
  43,12,"and Who created the pairs, all of them, and appointed for you ships and cattle that you ride"
  43,13,"that you may mount their backs and then remember the blessing of your Lord when you are mounted thereon and say, “Glory be to God, Who made this subservient unto us, though we were not equal to it"
  43,14,Truly unto our Lord do we turn.”
  43,15,Yet they assign to Him a portion from some of His servants. Truly man is a manifest ingrate
  43,16,Or has He taken daughters from that which He creates and favored you with sons
  43,17,"And when one of them receives glad tidings of that which he has set forth as a description of the Compassionate, his face blackens and he chokes with anguish"
  43,18,“What! One who is reared amid ornaments and is incoherent in dispute?”
  43,19,"And they have made the angels, who are servants of the Compassionate, females. Did they witness their creation? Their witnessing shall be recorded, and they will be questioned"
  43,20,"They say, “Had the Compassionate willed, we would not have worshipped them.” They have no knowledge thereof. They do naught but guess"
  43,21,Or did We give them a book beforehand to which they hold fast
  43,22,"Nay! They say, “We found our fathers upon a creed, and surely we are rightly guided in their footsteps.”"
