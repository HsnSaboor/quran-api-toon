quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,Truly the believers have prospered
  23,2,who are humble in their prayers
  23,3,and who turn away from idle talk
  23,4,and who give the alms
  23,5,and who guard their private parts
  23,6,"save from their spouses or those whom their right hands possess, for then they are not blameworthy—"
  23,7,"and as for those who seek beyond that, it is they who are transgressors—"
  23,8,and who keep their trusts and their covenant
  23,9,and who are mindful of their prayers
  23,10,It is they who are the heirs
  23,11,"who shall inherit Paradise, abiding therein"
  23,12,And indeed We created man from a draught of clay
  23,13,Then We made him a drop in a secure dwelling place
  23,14,"Then of the drop We created a blood clot, then of the blood clot We created a lump of flesh, then of the lump of flesh We created bones and We clothed the bones with flesh; then We brought him into being as another creation. Blessed is God, the best of creators"
  23,15,Then indeed you shall die thereafter
  23,16,Then surely you shall be raised up on the Day of Resurrection
  23,17,"And indeed We created above you seven paths, and We were not heedless of creation"
