quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Did We not create you from a base fluid
  77,21,then lodge it in a secure dwelling place
  77,22,for a known measure
  77,23,Thus do We determine; what excellent determiners
  77,24,Woe that Day to the deniers
  77,25,Did We not make the earth a receptacle
  77,26,for the living and the dead
  77,27,"And We placed therein firm, soaring mountains and gave you sweet water to drink"
  77,28,Woe that Day to the deniers
  77,29,Away to that which you used to deny
  77,30,Away to a threefold shadow
  77,31,"that provides no shade, nor avails against the flame"
  77,32,"Indeed, it throws up sparks like massive tree trunks"
  77,33,as though they were yellow camels
  77,34,Woe that Day to the deniers
  77,35,That is the Day on which they speak not
  77,36,"nor is permission granted them, such that they might offer excuses"
  77,37,Woe that Day to the deniers
  77,38,"This is the Day of Division, “We have gathered you and those of old.”"
  77,39,"So if you have a scheme, then scheme against Me"
  77,40,Woe that Day to the deniers
  77,41,Truly the reverent shall be amid shade and springs
  77,42,and fruits such as they desire
  77,43,“Eat and drink in enjoyment for that which you used to do.”
  77,44,Thus do We recompense the virtuous
  77,45,Woe that Day to the deniers
  77,46,Eat and enjoy yourselves a little; truly you are guilty
  77,47,Woe that Day to the deniers
  77,48,"And when it is said unto them, “Bow!” they bow not"
  77,49,Woe that Day to the deniers
  77,50,So in what discourse after this will they believe
