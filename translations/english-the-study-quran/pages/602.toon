quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,For the secure passage of the Quraysh
  106,2,their secure passage in the journey of winter and of summer
  106,3,so let them worship the Lord of this house
  106,4,Who relieved them of hunger and made them safe from fear
  107,1,Hast thou seen the one who denies religion
  107,2,That is the one who drives away the orphan
  107,3,and does not urge feeding the indigent
  107,4,So woe unto the praying
  107,5,who are heedless of their prayers
  107,6,those who strive to be seen
  107,7,yet refuse small kindnesses
  108,1,Truly We have bestowed abundant good upon thee
  108,2,So pray to thy Lord and sacrifice
  108,3,Truly thine enemy shall be the one without posterity
