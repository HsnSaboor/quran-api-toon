quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By the declining day
  103,2,truly mankind is in loss
  103,3,"save those who believe, perform righteous deeds, exhort one another to truth, and exhort one another to patience"
  104,1,Woe unto every slandering backbiter
  104,2,who amasses wealth and tallies it
  104,3,supposing that his wealth makes him immortal
  104,4,Nay! He shall surely be cast into the crushing Fire
  104,5,And what shall apprise thee of the crushing Fire
  104,6,"The Fire of God, ignited"
  104,7,which engulfs hearts
  104,8,Truly it is enclosed upon them
  104,9,in pillars outstretched
  105,1,Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with the masters of the elephant
  105,2,Did He not make their scheming go astray
  105,3,and send against them birds in swarms
  105,4,pelting them with stones of baked clay
  105,5,such that He made them like devoured husks
