quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  76,26,"prostrate unto Him during the night, and glorify Him by night at length"
  76,27,Truly they love the ephemeral and put a weighty day behind them
  76,28,"We created them and made firm their frames; and whensoever We will, We shall exchange them for others like them"
  76,29,"Truly this is a reminder; so let him who will, take a way unto his Lord"
  76,30,"And you do not will but that God wills. Truly God is Knowing, Wise"
  76,31,"He causes whomsoever He will to enter into His Mercy. And as for the wrongdoers, He has prepared for them a painful punishment"
  77,1,By those sent forth in succession
  77,2,By the storming tempests
  77,3,By the spreaders spreading
  77,4,By the discerners discerning
  77,5,And by those who bring forth the Reminder
  77,6,to excuse or to warn
  77,7,surely what you are promised will befall
  77,8,So when the stars are blotted out
  77,9,and when the sky is riven asunder
  77,10,when the mountains are scattered
  77,11,and when the messengers are slated
  77,12,for what day is it appointed
  77,13,For the Day of Division
  77,14,And what shall apprise thee of the Day of Division
  77,15,Woe that Day to the deniers
  77,16,Did We not destroy those of old
  77,17,then make those of later times follow them
  77,18,Thus do We deal with the guilty
  77,19,Woe that Day to the deniers
