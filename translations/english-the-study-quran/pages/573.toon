quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,Some among us submit and some among us are unjust; those who submit seek guidance
  72,15,"and as for the unjust, they are kindling for Hell.’”"
  72,16,"And [say], “[It was revealed unto me] that if they hold firm to the path, We shall give them abundant water"
  72,17,"that We may try them therewith, and whosoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, He leads him to a grievous punishment"
  72,18,and that places of worship are for God; so do not call upon another alongside God
  72,19,"and that when the servant of God rises to call upon Him, they well-nigh swarm upon him.”"
  72,20,"Say, “I call only upon my Lord, and I ascribe none as a partner unto Him.”"
  72,21,"Say, “I have no power over what harm or guidance may come to you.”"
  72,22,"Say, “None will protect me from God, and I shall never find refuge apart from Him"
  72,23,"if I do not convey from God and His messages. And whosoever disobeys God and His Messenger, his shall be the Fire of Hell, abiding therein forever"
  72,24,"such that when they see what they are promised, they will know who is weaker in helpers and fewer in number.”"
  72,25,"Say, “I know not whether that which you are promised is nigh or whether my Lord has appointed a term"
  72,26,"Knower of the Unseen, He does not disclose His Unseen to anyone"
  72,27,save to the one whom He approves as a messenger. Then He dispatches before him and behind him a guard
  72,28,that He may know that they have indeed conveyed the messages of their Lord. And He encompasses whatsoever is with them and keeps a numbered count of all things.”
