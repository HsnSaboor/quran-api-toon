quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,About what do they question one another
  78,2,About the Great Tiding
  78,3,regarding which they differ
  78,4,"Nay, but they will know"
  78,5,Then indeed they will know
  78,6,Did We not make the earth a resting place
  78,7,and the mountains stakes
  78,8,and create you in pairs
  78,9,and make your sleep repose
  78,10,and make the night a garment
  78,11,and the day for livelihood
  78,12,"And [did We not] build above you seven firmaments"
  78,13,and make a radiant lamp
  78,14,and send down water pouring from the rain clouds
  78,15,that We might produce grain and plants thereby
  78,16,and luxuriant gardens
  78,17,Truly the Day of Division is a Moment Appointed
  78,18,a day when the trumpet is blown and you come forth in throngs
  78,19,and the sky is opened as if it were gates
  78,20,and the mountains are set in motion as if they were a mirage
  78,21,Truly Hell lies in ambush
  78,22,a place unto which the rebellious return
  78,23,to tarry therein for ages
  78,24,They taste therein neither coolness nor drink
  78,25,"save boiling liquid and a cold, murky fluid"
  78,26,a fitting recompense
  78,27,Truly they anticipated not a reckoning
  78,28,and denied Our signs with utter denial
  78,29,And everything have We recorded in a book
  78,30,So taste! For We shall not increase you in aught but punishment
