quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What ails you? How do you judge
  37,155,Do you not reflect
  37,156,Or have you a manifest authority
  37,157,"Bring your Book, then, if you are truthful"
  37,158,They have made kinship between Him and the jinn—yet the jinn know that they will surely be arraigned
  37,159,Glory be to God above that which they ascribe
  37,160,Not so for God’s sincere servants
  37,161,For truly neither you nor that which you worship
  37,162,can tempt any against Him
  37,163,save he who is to burn in Hellfire
  37,164,"There is none among us, but that he has a known station"
  37,165,"And truly we are those who are ranged [in ranks]"
  37,166,Truly we are those who glorify
  37,167,"Indeed, they used to say"
  37,168,“If only we had a reminder from those of old
  37,169,then we would indeed be God’s sincere servants.”
  37,170,But they disbelieved in it. So soon they will know
  37,171,for indeed Our Word has already gone forth unto Our message bearers
  37,172,that they will surely be helped
  37,173,and that Our host will surely be victorious
  37,174,So turn away from them for a time
  37,175,and observe them; for they will soon observe
  37,176,Do they seek to hasten Our Punishment
  37,177,"When it alights in their very midst, evil will be the morning of those who were warned"
  37,178,So turn away from them for a time
  37,179,and observe; for they will soon observe
  37,180,"Glory be to thy Lord, the Lord of Might, above that which they ascribe"
  37,181,Peace be upon the message bearers
  37,182,"And praise be to God, Lord of the worlds"
