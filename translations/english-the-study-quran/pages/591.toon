quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the sky and that which comes by night
  86,2,And what will apprise thee of that which comes by night
  86,3,It is the piercing star
  86,4,Over every soul there is a guardian
  86,5,So let man consider that from which he was created
  86,6,He was created from a gushing fluid
  86,7,issuing from between the loins and the pelvic arch
  86,8,Truly He is able to bring him back
  86,9,on the Day when secrets are tested
  86,10,whereat man has neither strength nor helper
  86,11,By the resurgent sky
  86,12,and by the furrowed earth
  86,13,truly it is indeed a decisive Word
  86,14,And it is not for amusement
  86,15,Truly they are devising a scheme
  86,16,"and I, too, am devising a scheme"
  86,17,So be gentle with the disbelievers; grant them respite for a while
  87,1,"Glorify the Name of thy Lord, the Most High"
  87,2,"Who created, then fashioned"
  87,3,"Who measured out, then guided"
  87,4,and Who brought forth pasture
  87,5,then made it as blackened stubble
  87,6,"We shall teach thee to recite, that thou wilt not forget"
  87,7,save what God wills. Truly He knows that which is open and that which is hidden
  87,8,And We shall ease thy way unto ease
  87,9,"So remind, should the reminder benefit"
  87,10,he who fears will remember
  87,11,while the most wretched shall avoid it
  87,12,he who enters into the greatest Fire
  87,13,then neither dies therein nor lives
  87,14,He indeed prospers who is purified
  87,15,remembers the Name of his Lord and prays
