  41,47,"Unto Him is knowledge of the Hour referred. No fruits come forth from their sheaths, nor does any female bear or bring forth, save by His Knowledge. And on the Day when He will call unto them, “Where are My partners?” they will say, “We admit unto Thee that none among us bears witness.”"
  41,48,"That which they used to call upon before will forsake them, and they will know for certain that they have no refuge"
  41,49,"Man wearies not of supplicating for good, and if evil befalls him, he is despondent, despairing"
  41,50,"And if We make him taste some mercy from Us after hardship has befallen him, surely he will say, “This is mine; I think not that the Hour will come. If I am returned unto my Lord, surely with Him shall I have that which is most beautiful.” So We shall inform those who disbelieved of that which they have done, and We shall cause them to taste of a grave punishment"
  41,51,"And when We bless man, he turns away and withdraws. Yet when evil befalls him, he is full of prolonged supplication"
  41,52,"Say, “What think you, if it is from God, yet you disbelieve in it? Who is more astray than one in extreme schism?”"
