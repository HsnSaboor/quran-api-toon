quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  36,55,Truly the inhabitants of the Garden on that Day will be busy rejoicing
  36,56,they and their spouses reclining upon couches in the shade
  36,57,Therein they have fruit and whatsoever they call for
  36,58,“Peace!” a word from a Lord most Merciful
  36,59,"Stand apart this Day, O guilty ones"
  36,60,Did I not enjoin upon you
  36,61,"Children of Adam, that you not worship Satan—truly he is a manifest enemy unto you— a and that you worship Me? This is a straight path"
  36,62,For indeed he has led many among you astray. Did you not understand
  36,63,This is the Hell that you were promised
  36,64,Burn therein today for having disbelieved
  36,65,"On that Day We shall seal their mouths. Their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will bear witness to that which they used to earn"
  36,66,"And had We willed, We would have blotted out their eyes. Then they would race to the path; yet how would they see"
  36,67,"And had We willed, We would have transformed them in their places. Then they could neither advance nor go back"
  36,68,"And whomsoever We give long life, We cause him to regress in creation. Do they not understand"
  36,69,And We have not taught him poetry; nor would it befit him. It is but a reminder and a clear Quran
  36,70,"to warn whomsoever is alive, and so that the Word may come due for the disbelievers"
