quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,43,"No community can hasten its term, nor delay it"
  23,44,"Then We sent Our messengers in succession. Whenever there came unto a community its messenger, they would deny him. So We caused them to follow one another, and made them the objects of stories. So away with a people who believe not"
  23,45,Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and a manifest authority
  23,46,to Pharaoh and his notables. But they waxed arrogant and were a haughty people
  23,47,"They said, “Shall we believe in two human beings like us, while their people are slaves we possess?”"
  23,48,"But they denied them, and so were among the destroyed"
  23,49,"And indeed We gave unto Moses the Book, that haply they may be guided"
  23,50,"And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and We gave them refuge in a high place of stillness and a flowing spring"
  23,51,O messengers! Eat of the good things and work righteousness. Truly I know what you do
  23,52,"And truly this community of yours is one community, and I am your Lord, so reverence Me"
  23,53,"But they made their affair to be founded upon different scriptures, each party exulting in what it had"
  23,54,So leave them in their heedlessness for a time
  23,55,"Do they reckon that, [on account of] the wealth and the children that We have provided them"
  23,56,"We hasten unto good for them? Nay, but they are unaware"
  23,57,Truly those who are in awe for fear of their Lord
  23,58,and those who believe in the signs of their Lord
  23,59,and those who ascribe not partners unto their Lord
