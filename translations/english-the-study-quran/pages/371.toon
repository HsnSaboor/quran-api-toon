quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,And make for me faithful renown among later generations
  26,85,And place me among the heirs of the Garden of bliss
  26,86,And forgive my father—he is one of those who are astray
  26,87,And disgrace me not on the Day they are resurrected
  26,88,the Day when neither wealth nor children avail
  26,89,save for him who comes to God with a sound heart.”
  26,90,And the Garden will be brought nigh unto the reverent
  26,91,and Hellfire will become apparent to the errant
  26,92,"And it will be said unto them, “Where is that which you worshipped"
  26,93,apart from God? Are they helping you or helping themselves?”
  26,94,"Then they shall be toppled into it, they and the errant"
  26,95,and the hosts of Iblis all together
  26,96,"They will say, as they dispute with one another therein"
  26,97,"“By God, indeed we were in manifest error"
  26,98,when we made you equal with the Lord of the worlds
  26,99,And none caused us to go astray but the guilty
  26,100,So now we have no intercessors
  26,101,nor any loyal friend
  26,102,"If we had another turn, we would be among the believers.”"
  26,103,"Truly in that is a sign, but most of them are not believers"
  26,104,"And truly thy Lord is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,105,The people of Noah denied the messengers
  26,106,"when their brother Noah said unto them, “Will you not be reverent"
  26,107,Truly I am a trustworthy messenger unto you
  26,108,So reverence God and obey me
  26,109,And I ask not of you any reward for it; my reward lies only with the Lord of the worlds
  26,110,So reverence God and obey me.”
  26,111,"They said, “Shall we believe you, when the lowliest follow you?”"
