quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,58,"And when you call to prayer, they take it in mockery and as play. That is because they are a people who do not understand"
  5,59,"Say, “O People of the Book! Are you vengeful toward us for no other reason than that we believe in God and in that which has been sent down unto us and in that which was sent down before, and because most of you are iniquitous?”"
  5,60,"Say, “Shall I inform you of something worse than that by way of recompense from God? Whomsoever God has cursed and upon whom is His Wrath, and among whom He has made some to be apes and swine, and who worship false deities, such are in a worse situation, and further astray from the right way.”"
  5,61,"When they come to you, they say, “We believe.” But they certainly entered with disbelief and they have certainly left with it, and God knows best what they were concealing"
  5,62,"Thou seest many of them hastening to sin and enmity, and consuming what is forbidden. Evil indeed is that which they were doing"
  5,63,Why do the sages and the rabbis not forbid them from their sinful speech and their consuming what is forbidden? Evil indeed is that which they were working
  5,64,"The Jews say, “God’s Hand is shackled.” Shackled are their hands, and they are cursed for what they say. Nay, but His two Hands are outstretched, He bestows as He wills. Surely that which has been sent down unto thee from thy Lord will increase many of them in rebellion and disbelief. And We have cast enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection. As often as they ignite a flame for war, God extinguishes it. They endeavor to work corruption upon the earth. And God loves not the workers of corruption"
