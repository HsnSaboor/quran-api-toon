quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Truly thy Lord knows that thou dost stand vigil well-nigh two-thirds of the night, or a half of it, or a third of it, as do a group of those who are with thee; and God measures out the night and the day. He knows that you will not keep count of it and has relented unto you; so recite that which is easy for you of the Quran. He knows that some of you will be sick, while others travel upon the earth, seeking God’s Bounty, and others fight in the way of God. So recite that which is easy of it, perform the prayer, give the alms, and lend unto God a goodly loan—whatever good you send forth for your souls, you will find it with God better and greater in reward. And seek God’s Forgiveness. Truly God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  74,1,O thou who art covered
  74,2,arise and warn
  74,3,Thy Lord magnify
  74,4,Thy garments purify
  74,5,And defilement shun
  74,6,"Grant not favor, seeking gain"
  74,7,And for the sake of thy Lord be patient
  74,8,For when the trumpet is blown
  74,9,that Day shall be a difficult day
  74,10,"for the disbelievers, not of ease"
  74,11,Leave Me alone with the one whom I created
  74,12,and to whom I gave vast wealth
  74,13,and sons at his side
  74,14,and made smooth the way for him
  74,15,Yet he desires that I give more
  74,16,Nay! Truly he sets himself against Our signs
  74,17,I shall constrain him to endure a steep ascent
