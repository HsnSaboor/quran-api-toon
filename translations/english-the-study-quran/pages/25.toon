  2,164,"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth; and the variation of the night and the day; and the ships that run upon the sea with what benefits mankind; and the water God sends down from the sky whereby He revives the earth after its death, scattering all manner of beast therein; and the shifting of the winds; and the clouds subdued between the sky and the earth are surely signs for a people who understand"
  2,165,"Among mankind there are some who take up equals apart from God, loving them like loving God. But those who believe are more ardent in their love of God. If those who do wrong could but see, when they see the punishment, that power belongs altogether to God and that God is severe in punishment"
  2,166,"when those who were followed disavow those who followed, and they see the punishment, while all recourse will be cut off from them"
  2,167,"And those who followed will say, “If we had another turn, we would disavow them as they disavowed us.” Thus does God show them their deeds as a source of regret for them, and they shall not leave the Fire"
  2,168,"O mankind! Eat of what is lawful and good on the earth, and follow not the footsteps of Satan. Truly he is a manifest enemy unto you"
  2,169,"He only commands you to evil and indecency, and to say of God what you know not"
