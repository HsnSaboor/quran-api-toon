quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,"[though] they will be made to see them. The guilty would wish to ransom himself from the punishment of that Day at the price of his children"
  70,12,"his spouse, and his brother"
  70,13,his kin who had sheltered him
  70,14,"and all who are on the earth, that it might save him"
  70,15,"Nay, but it is a churning fire"
  70,16,ripping away the scalp
  70,17,calling to those who turned their backs and fled
  70,18,who amassed and hoarded
  70,19,Truly man was created anxious
  70,20,"when evil befalls him, fretful"
  70,21,"and when good befalls him, begrudging"
  70,22,save those who perform prayer
  70,23,who are constant in their prayers
  70,24,and in whose wealth is an acknowledged due
  70,25,for the beggar and the deprived
  70,26,those who affirm the Day of Judgment
  70,27,and who are wary of the punishment of their Lord—
  70,28,truly there is no security from the punishment of their Lord
  70,29,those who guard their private parts
  70,30,"save from their spouses or those whom their right hands possess, for then they are not blameworthy"
  70,31,"but whosoever seeks beyond that, they are the transgressors"
  70,32,those who abide by their trusts and their pact
  70,33,who uphold their testimony
  70,34,and who are mindful of their prayers
  70,35,"those shall be in Gardens, honored"
  70,36,So how is it that those who disbelieve scramble toward thee
  70,37,from the right and from the left in droves
  70,38,Does every man among them desire to be admitted into a Garden of bliss
  70,39,Nay! Truly We created them from that which they know
