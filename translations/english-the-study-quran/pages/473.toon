  40,50,"They will reply, “Did not your messengers bring you clear proofs?” They will say, “Yea, indeed.” They will say, “Then make supplications!” But the supplication of the disbelievers is naught but astray"
  40,51,Truly We shall help Our messengers and those who believe during the life of this world and on the Day when the witnesses arise
  40,52,"the Day when the excuses of the wrongdoers will not benefit them, and theirs will be the curse, and theirs will be the evil abode"
  40,53,"And indeed We gave Moses guidance, and We bequeathed the Book unto the Children of Israel"
  40,54,"as a guidance, and as a reminder for possessors of intellect"
  40,55,"So be patient. Surely God’s Promise is true. And ask forgiveness for thy sin, and hymn the praise of thy Lord at eventide and at dawn"
  40,56,"Truly those who dispute concerning the signs of God without any authority having come to them, there is naught in their breasts but a sense of greatness that they will never attain. So seek refuge in God. Truly He is the Hearer, the Seer"
