quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,103,But when they had submitted and Abraham had laid him upon his forehead
  37,104,"We called unto him, “O Abraham"
  37,105,Thou hast been true to the vision.” Thus indeed do We recompense the virtuous
  37,106,Truly this was the manifest trial
  37,107,Then We ransomed him with a great sacrifice
  37,108,"And We left [a blessing] upon him among later generations"
  37,109,“Peace be upon Abraham.”
  37,110,Thus do We recompense the virtuous
  37,111,Truly he was among Our believing servants
  37,112,"And We gave him glad tidings of Isaac, a prophet from among the righteous"
  37,113,And We blessed him and Isaac. And among their progeny are the virtuous and those who clearly wrong themselves
  37,114,And We were gracious unto Moses and Aaron
  37,115,We saved them and their people from great distress
  37,116,"and helped them, so that they were the victors"
  37,117,And We gave the two of them the Book that makes clear
  37,118,and guided the two of them upon the straight path
  37,119,"And We left [a blessing] upon them among later generations"
  37,120,“Peace be upon Moses and Aaron.”
  37,121,Thus indeed do We recompense the virtuous
  37,122,Truly they were among Our believing servants
  37,123,And truly Elias was among the message bearers
  37,124,"when he said to his people, “Will you not reverence"
  37,125,Do you call upon Baal and leave the most beautiful of creators
  37,126,God is your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of old.”
