quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"There is no good in most of their secret converse, save for him who enjoins charity or kindness or reconciliation between men. And whosoever does that, seeking God’s Good Pleasure, We shall grant him a great reward"
  4,115,"But whosoever opposes the Messenger, after guidance has been made clear to him, and follows a way other than that of the believers, We shall leave him on [the path] he has taken, and We shall cause him to burn in Hell—what an evil journey’s end"
  4,116,"Truly God forgives not that any partner be ascribed unto Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whomsoever He will. Whosoever ascribes partners unto God has surely gone far astray"
  4,117,They call upon only females in His stead; they call upon none but a defiant Satan
  4,118,"whom God has cursed, who said, “Assuredly I shall take of Thy servants an appointed share"
  4,119,"and surely I shall lead them astray, and arouse desires in them. I shall command them and they will slit the ears of cattle; I shall command them and they will alter God’s creation.” Whosoever takes Satan as a protector apart from God has surely suffered a manifest loss"
  4,120,"He makes them promises and stirs in them desires, but Satan promises naught but delusion"
  4,121,"Such will have their refuge in Hell, and will find no refuge therefrom"
