quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,39,"Among His signs is that thou seest the earth diminished; then, when We send down water upon it, it quivers and swells. He Who gives it life is surely the One Who gives life to the dead. Truly He is Powerful over all things"
  41,40,"Truly those who deviate with regard to Our signs are not hidden from Us. Is one who is cast in the Fire better, or one who comes in security on the Day of Resurrection? Do what you will; truly He sees whatsoever you do"
  41,41,Truly those who disbelieve in the Reminder when it comes unto them And truly it is a mighty Book
  41,42,"Falsehood comes not upon it from before it or from behind it; a revelation from One Wise, Praised"
  41,43,Naught has been said unto thee save that which has been said unto the messengers before thee. Truly thy Lord is Possessed of Forgiveness and Possessed of a Painful Retribution
  41,44,"Had We made it a Quran in a foreign tongue, they would say, “If only its signs were expounded. What! A foreign tongue and an Arab [messenger]?” Say, “It is a guidance and a healing for those who believe, and those who do not believe have a deafness in their ears, and it is a blindness for them. Such are called from a place far off.”"
  41,45,"Indeed, We gave Moses the Book; then difference arose concerning it. And were it not for a Word that had already gone forth from thy Lord, judgment would have been made between them. Yet truly they are confounded by doubt regarding it"
  41,46,"Whosoever works righteousness, it is for his own soul. And whosoever commits evil, it is to the detriment thereof. It is not for thy Lord to wrong His servants"
