quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,1,By those ranged in ranks
  37,2,and the drivers driving
  37,3,and the reciters of a reminder
  37,4,truly your God is One
  37,5,"Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and Lord of the easts"
  37,6,"Truly We adorned the lowest heaven with an ornament, the stars"
  37,7,and a guard against every defiant satan
  37,8,"They listen not to the Highest Assembly, for they are repelled from every side—"
  37,9,"cast out, and theirs shall be a punishment everlasting—"
  37,10,save one who snatches a fragment as a piercing flame pursues him
  37,11,"So ask them, are they more difficult to create, or those whom We created? Truly We created them from a viscous clay"
  37,12,"Indeed, but thou dost marvel, while they scoff"
  37,13,"And when they are reminded, they do not remember"
  37,14,"And when they see a sign, they seek to scoff"
  37,15,"and say, “This is naught but manifest sorcery"
  37,16,What! When we have died and are dust and bones are we to be resurrected
  37,17,and our fathers of old?”
  37,18,"Say, “Yes, and debased will you be.”"
  37,19,Then there will be but a single cry. And they will then behold
  37,20,"They will say, “Oh, woe unto us! This is the Day of Judgment.”"
  37,21,This is the Day of Division that you used to deny
  37,22,Gather those who did wrong together with their spouses and that which they used to worship
  37,23,"apart from God, and guide them unto the path of Hellfire"
  37,24,And stop them. Surely they are to be questioned
