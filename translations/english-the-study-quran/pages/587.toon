quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When the sky is cleft asunder
  82,2,and when the stars are dispersed
  82,3,when the seas are burst forth
  82,4,and when graves are turned inside out
  82,5,then shall each soul know what it has sent forth and what it has left behind. j
  82,6,O mankind! What has deluded you with regard to your noble Lord
  82,7,"Who created you, then fashioned you, then proportioned you"
  82,8,assembling you in whatever form He willed
  82,9,Nay! But you deny religion
  82,10,And yet truly over you there are guardians
  82,11,"noble, writing"
  82,12,knowing what you do
  82,13,Truly the pious shall be in bliss
  82,14,and truly the profligate shall be in Hellfire
  82,15,burning therein on the Day of Judgment
  82,16,And they will not be absent from it
  82,17,And what will apprise thee of the Day of Judgment
  82,18,Then what will apprise thee of the Day of Judgment
  82,19,"A day when no soul will avail another soul in any way, and the Command that Day is with God"
  83,1,Woe unto the defrauders
  83,2,"who, when they take measure from people, demand [it] in full"
  83,3,"and when they measure for them or weigh for them, they stint"
  83,4,Do they not think that they will be resurrected
  83,5,unto a tremendous day—
  83,6,a day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds
