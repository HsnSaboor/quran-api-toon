quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star when it sets
  53,2,your companion has neither strayed nor erred
  53,3,nor does he speak out of caprice
  53,4,It is naught but a revelation revealed
  53,5,taught him by one of awesome power
  53,6,"Possessed of vigor, he stood upright"
  53,7,when he was upon the highest horizon
  53,8,Then he drew nigh and came close
  53,9,till he was within two bows’ length or nearer
  53,10,Then He revealed to His servant what He revealed
  53,11,The heart lied not in what it saw
  53,12,Do you then dispute with him as to what he saw
  53,13,And indeed he saw him another time
  53,14,at the lote tree of the boundary
  53,15,by which lies the Garden of the refuge
  53,16,when there covered the lote tree that which covered
  53,17,The gaze swerved not; nor did it transgress
  53,18,"Indeed, he saw the greatest of the signs of his Lord"
  53,19,Have you considered al-Lat and al-?Uzza
  53,20,"and Manat, the third, the other"
  53,21,Unto you males and unto Him females
  53,22,"This, then, is an unfair division"
  53,23,"They are naught but names that you have named—you and your fathers—for which God has sent down no authority. They follow naught but conjecture and that which their souls desire, though guidance has surely come to them from their Lord"
  53,24,Or shall man have whatsoever he longs for
  53,25,Yet unto God belong the Hereafter and this world
  53,26,"And how many an angel is there in the heavens whose intercession avails naught, save after God grants leave unto whomsoever He will and unto the one with whom He is content"
