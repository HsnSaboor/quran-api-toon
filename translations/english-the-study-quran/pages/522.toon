quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"He said, “What is your errand, O messengers?”"
  51,32,"They said, “We have been sent unto a guilty people"
  51,33,to send upon them stones of clay
  51,34,marked by thy Lord for the prodigal.”
  51,35,So We brought forth those among them who were believers
  51,36,yet We did not find therein but one house of submitters
  51,37,And We left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment
  51,38,"And in Moses [We left a sign], when We sent him to Pharaoh with a manifest authority"
  51,39,"But he turned away with his court and said, “A sorcerer or one possessed.”"
  51,40,"So We seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea, for he was blameworthy"
  51,41,"And in ?Ad [We left a sign], when We sent upon them the barren wind"
  51,42,"Naught did it leave that it came upon, but that it made it as bones decayed"
  51,43,"And in Thamud [We left a sign], when it was said unto them, “Enjoy yourselves for a time.”"
  51,44,"Then they insolently defied the Command of their Lord, and the thunderbolt seized them as they looked on"
  51,45,So they were not able to rise; nor could they help one another
  51,46,"As for the people of Noah before, truly they were an iniquitous people"
  51,47,And the sky We established with might; truly We make vast
  51,48,And the earth We laid out—what excellent spreaders
  51,49,"And of all things We created pairs, that haply you may remember"
  51,50,So flee unto God. Truly I am a clear warner unto you from Him
  51,51,And do not set up another god along with God. Truly I am a clear warner unto you from Him
