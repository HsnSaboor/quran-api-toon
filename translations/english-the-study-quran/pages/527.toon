quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,Truly those who believe not in the Hereafter name the angels with female names
  53,28,Yet they have no knowledge thereof. They follow naught but conjecture; and surely conjecture avails naught against the Truth
  53,29,So shun whosoever turns away from Our Reminder and desires naught but the life of the world
  53,30,"That is the extent of their knowledge. Surely thy Lord knows best those who stray from His way, and He knows best those who are rightly guided"
  53,31,"Unto God belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth, that He may requite those who commit evil for that which they have done, and that He may requite those who are virtuous with that which is most beautiful"
  53,32,"those who shun grave sins and indecencies, save what is slight; truly your Lord is of vast forgiveness. He knows you best, from when He brought you forth from the earth and when you were hidden in your mothers’ bellies. So deem not yourselves purified. He knows best the reverent"
  53,33,Have you seen the one who turned away
  53,34,"gave little, and then withheld"
  53,35,"Does he have knowledge of the Unseen, such that he sees"
  53,36,Or has he not been informed of that which is in the scriptures of Moses
  53,37,"and Abraham, who fulfilled"
  53,38,that none shall bear the burden of another
  53,39,that man shall have naught but that for which he endeavored
  53,40,and that his endeavoring shall be seen
  53,41,whereupon he will be rewarded for it with the fullest reward
  53,42,that the ultimate end is unto thy Lord
  53,43,that it is He Who causes laughter and weeping
  53,44,that it is He Who causes death and gives life
