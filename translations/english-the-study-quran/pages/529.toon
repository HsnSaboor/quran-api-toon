quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  54,7,With their eyes humbled they emerge from the graves as if they were scattered locusts
  54,8,"scrambling toward the caller. The disbelievers say, “This is a calamitous day.”"
  54,9,"The people of Noah denied before them, for they denied Our servant and said, “Possessed!” And he was reproved"
  54,10,"Then he called upon his Lord, “Truly I am overcome. Help!”"
  54,11,So We opened the gates of the sky with pouring water
  54,12,"and We caused the earth to burst forth with springs, such that the waters met for a matter determined"
  54,13,Then We carried him upon a thing of planks and nails
  54,14,coursing under Our Eyes as a recompense for one who was rejected
  54,15,And indeed We left it as a sign; so is there any who remembers
  54,16,"How, then, were My Punishment and My warnings"
  54,17,And indeed We have made the Quran easy to remember; so is there any who remembers
  54,18,"Ad denied. How, then, were My Punishment and My warnings"
  54,19,Truly We sent upon them a howling wind on a day of incessant misfortune
  54,20,tearing out people as if they were uprooted palm trunks
  54,21,"How, then, were My Punishment and My warnings"
  54,22,And indeed We have made the Quran easy to remember; so is there any who remembers
  54,23,Thamud denied the warnings
  54,24,"They said, “Shall we follow a single human being from among us? Then we would surely be astray and mad"
  54,25,"Has the reminder been cast upon him from among us? Nay, he is an insolent liar.”"
  54,26,On the morrow they will know who is the insolent liar
  54,27,Behold! We are sending the she-camel as a trial for them; so watch them and be patient
