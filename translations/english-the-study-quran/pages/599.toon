quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  98,8,"Their reward is with their Lord, Gardens of Eden with rivers running below, abiding therein forever, God being content with them and they being content with Him. That is for whosoever fears his Lord"
  99,1,When the earth is shaken with her shaking
  99,2,and the earth yields up her burdens
  99,3,"and man says, “What ails her?”"
  99,4,That Day she shall convey her chronicles
  99,5,for thy Lord inspired her
  99,6,That Day mankind shall issue forth upon diverse paths to witness their deeds
  99,7,So whosoever does a mote’s weight of good shall see it
  99,8,And whosoever does a mote’s weight of evil shall see it
  100,1,By the panting chargers
  100,2,by the strikers of sparks
  100,3,by the raiders at dawn
  100,4,raising thereby a trail of dust
  100,5,penetrating to the center altogether
  100,6,truly man is ungrateful to his Lord
  100,7,and truly he is a witness to that
  100,8,and truly he is fierce in his love for good things
  100,9,Does he not know that when what lies within graves is turned inside out
