quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,Truly it is a Noble Quran
  56,78,in a Book concealed
  56,79,"None touch it, save those made pure"
  56,80,a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
  56,81,Do you then scorn this discourse
  56,82,and make the denial thereof your provision
  56,83,"Why, then, when it reaches the throat"
  56,84,while you are looking on
  56,85,"—and We are nearer to him than you, though you see not—"
  56,86,"why, then, if you are unconstrained"
  56,87,"do you not return it, if you are truthful"
  56,88,So if one be among those brought nigh
  56,89,"then comfort, bounty, and a Garden of bliss"
  56,90,And if one be among the companions of the right
  56,91,then peace unto thee from the companions of the right
  56,92,But if one be among the deniers who are astray
  56,93,then a welcome of boiling liquid
  56,94,and burning in Hellfire
  56,95,"Verily, this is the truth of certainty"
  56,96,"so glorify the Name of thy Lord, the Magnificent"
  57,1,"Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth glorifies God, and He is the Mighty, the Wise"
  57,2,"Unto Him belongs sovereignty over the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death, and He is Powerful over all things"
  57,3,"He is the First, and the Last, and the Outward, and the Inward; and He is Knower of all things"
