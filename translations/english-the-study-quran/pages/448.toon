quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"who would say, ‘Are you among those who confirm"
  37,53,"What! When we have died and are dust and bones, are we to be requited?’”"
  37,54,"He will say, “Will you look?”"
  37,55,So he will look and see him in the midst of Hellfire
  37,56,"He will say, “By God! You did well-nigh destroy me"
  37,57,"and if not for the blessing of my Lord, I would have been among the arraigned"
  37,58,Are we then not to die
  37,59,"but our first death, and are we not to be punished"
  37,60,This indeed is the great triumph!”
  37,61,"For the like of this, then, let the laborers labor"
  37,62,Is this a better welcome or the tree of Zaqqum
  37,63,Truly We have made it a trial for the wrongdoers
  37,64,Truly it is a tree that emerges in the depths of Hellfire
  37,65,Its spathes are as the heads of satans
  37,66,They will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith
  37,67,Then on top of it they will have a brew of a boiling liquid
  37,68,Then their return shall be unto Hellfire
  37,69,Truly they found their fathers astray
  37,70,yet they hasten in their footsteps
  37,71,And before them most of those of old had indeed gone astray
  37,72,though We had indeed sent warners among them
  37,73,So behold how those who were warned fared in the end
  37,74,Not so for God’s sincere servants
  37,75,And indeed Noah cried out to Us. How excellent are those who respond
  37,76,We saved him and his people from great distress
