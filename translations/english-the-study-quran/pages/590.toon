quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  85,1,By the sky possessed of constellations
  85,2,By the Day promised
  85,3,and by the witness and the witnessed
  85,4,"May they perish, the inhabitants of the pit"
  85,5,the fire well fueled
  85,6,when they sat by it
  85,7,and were witness to what they did unto the believers
  85,8,"and took vengeance on them for naught but that they believed in God, the Mighty, the Praised"
  85,9,unto Whom belongs sovereignty over the heavens and the earth; and God is Witness over all things
  85,10,"Truly those who persecute believing men and believing women, then do not repent, theirs shall be the punishment of Hell, and theirs shall be the punishment of the burning"
  85,11,"Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds, theirs shall be Gardens with rivers running below: that is the supreme triumph"
  85,12,Truly thy Lord’s assault is severe
  85,13,Truly it is He Who originates and brings back
  85,14,"And He is the Forgiving, the Loving"
  85,15,"Possessor of the Throne, the Glorious"
  85,16,Doer of whatsoever He will
  85,17,Hast thou heard tell of the hosts—
  85,18,Pharaoh and Thamud
  85,19,Yet those who disbelieve are in denial
