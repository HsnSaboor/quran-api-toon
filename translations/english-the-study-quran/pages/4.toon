quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"Their parable is that of one who kindled a fire, and when it lit up what was around him, God took away their light, and left them in darkness, unseeing"
  2,18,"Deaf, dumb, and blind, they return not"
  2,19,"Or a cloudburst from the sky, in which there is darkness, thunder, and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps, fearing death. And God encompasses the disbelievers"
  2,20,"The lightning all but snatches away their sight. Whenever it shines for them, they walk therein, and when darkness comes over them, they halt. Had God willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight. Truly God is Powerful over all things"
  2,21,"O mankind! Worship your Lord, Who created you, and those who were before you, that haply you may be reverent"
  2,22,"He Who made for you the earth a place of repose and the sky a canopy, and sent water from the sky by which He brought forth fruits for your provision. So do not set up equals unto God, knowingly"
  2,23,"If you are in doubt concerning what We have sent down unto Our servant, then bring a surah like it, and call your witnesses apart from God if you are truthful"
  2,24,"And if you do not, and you will not, then be mindful of the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers"
