  4,39,"What harm would it have done them were they to believe in God and the Last Day, and spend of that which God has provided them. God knows them well"

  4,41,"How will it be when We bring forth a witness from every community, and We bring thee as a witness against these"
  4,42,"On that Day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they were level with the earth, and they will conceal no account from God"
  4,43,"O you who believe! Draw not near unto prayer when you are drunken until you know what you are uttering, nor in a state of ritual impurity—unless you are passing through—until you have washed.

Truly God is Pardoning, Forgiving"
  4,44,"Hast thou not considered those who were given a portion of the Book, who purchase error, and wish that you too should stray from the path"
