  17,87,save a mercy from thy Lord. Truly His Bounty toward thee is ever great
  17,88,"Say, “Surely if mankind and jinn banded together to bring the like of this Quran, they would not bring the like thereof, even if they supported one another.”"

  17,90,"And they say, “We shall not believe in you till you make a spring gush forth for us from the earth"
  17,91,"or till you have a garden of date palms and grapevines, and you make streams gush forth in the midst of it"
  17,92,"or till you make the sky fall upon us in pieces, as you have claimed, or you bring God and the angels before us"
  17,93,"or till you have a house of gold ornament, or you ascend to Heaven. And we shall not believe in your ascension till you bring down unto us a book we can read.” Say, “Glory be to my Lord! Am I aught but a human being, a messenger?”"
  17,94,"And nothing hindered men from believing when guidance came unto them, save that they said, “Has God sent a human being as a messenger?”"
  17,95,"Say, “Were there angels walking about upon the earth in peace, We would have sent down upon them an angel from Heaven as a messenger.”"
  17,96,"Say, “God suffices as a Witness between you and me. Verily, of His servants He is Aware, Seeing.”"
