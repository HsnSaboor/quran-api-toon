quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,71,"People of the Book! Why do you confound the truth with falsehood, and knowingly conceal the truth"
  3,72,"And a group of the People of the Book say, “Believe in what was sent down unto those who believe at the start of the day, and disbelieve at its end, that haply they may return"
  3,73,"And believe none but him who follows your religion. Say, “Truly guidance is God’s Guidance\" lest anyone be granted the like of what you were granted or dispute with you before your Lord.” Say, “Truly bounty is in God’s Hand. He grants it to whomsoever He will, and God is All-Encompassing, Knowing.”"
  3,74,"He selects for His Mercy whomsoever He will, and God is Possessed of Tremendous Bounty"
  3,75,"Among the People of the Book is one who, were you to entrust to him a quintal, would render it back to you. And among them is one who, were you to entrust to him a dinar, would not render it back to you unless you kept standing over him. That is because they say, “There is nothing to stop us when it comes to the non-Jews.” But they knowingly speak a lie against God"
  3,76,Yea! Whosoever fulfills his pact and is reverent—truly God loves the reverent
  3,77,"Truly those who sell God’s Pact and their oaths for a paltry price, they shall have no share in the Hereafter and God will not speak to them, nor will He look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them. And theirs shall be a painful punishment"
