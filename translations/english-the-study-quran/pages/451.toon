quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,But they denied him; so they are surely to be arraigned
  37,128,Not so for God’s sincere servants
  37,129,"And We left [a blessing] upon him among later generations"
  37,130,“Peace be upon Elias.”
  37,131,Thus indeed do We recompense the virtuous
  37,132,Truly he was among Our believing servants
  37,133,And truly Lot was among the message bearers
  37,134,Behold! We saved him and his family all together
  37,135,save for an old woman who was among those who lagged behind
  37,136,Then We destroyed the others

  37,149,"So ask them, does your Lord have daughters while they have sons"
  37,150,"Or did We create the angels female, while they were witnesses"
  37,151,Behold! It is of their own perversion that they say
  37,152,"“God has begotten,” while truly they are liars"
  37,153,Has He chosen daughters over sons
