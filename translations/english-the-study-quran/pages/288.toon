quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,59,"Naught hinders Us from sending signs, save that those of old denied them. And We gave unto Thamud the she-camel as a clear portent, but they wronged her. And We do not send down Our signs, save to inspire fear"
  17,60,"And [remember] when We said unto thee, “Surely thy Lord encompasses mankind.” We did not ordain the vision that We showed thee, save as a trial for mankind, and the Accursed Tree in the Quran. And We inspire fear in them, but it increases them in naught but great rebellion"
  17,61,"And when We said unto the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” they all prostrated, save Iblis. He said, “Shall I prostrate before one whom Thou hast created of clay?”"
  17,62,"He said, “Dost Thou see this, which Thou hast honored above me? If Thou dost grant me reprieve till the Day of Resurrection, I shall surely gain mastery over his progeny, all save a few.”"
  17,63,"He said, “Go! And whosoever among them should follow thee, surely Hell shall be thy recompense—an ample recompense"
  17,64,"So incite whomsoever thou canst among them with thy voice, and bear down upon them with thy cavalry and thy infantry, and be their partner in wealth and children, and make them promises.” Satan promises them naught but delusion"
  17,65,"“As for My servants, truly thou hast no authority over them.” And thy Lord suffices as a Guardian"
  17,66,"Your Lord is He Who makes the ships sail upon the sea, that you might seek of His Bounty. Verily, He is Merciful unto you"
