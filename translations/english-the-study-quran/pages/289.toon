  17,68,Do you feel secure that He will not cause the shore to engulf you or unleash a torrent of stones upon you? Then would you find no guardian for yourselves
  17,69,"Or do you feel secure that He will not cause you to return to it another time, and unleash upon you a tempestuous wind, and drown you for your having been ungrateful? Then you would find no avenger therein against Us"
  17,70,"We have indeed honored the Children of Adam, and We carry them over land and sea, and provide them with good things, and We have favored them above many We have created"
  17,71,"On the Day We shall call every people by their imam, whosoever is given his book in his right hand, it is they who shall read their book, and they shall not be wronged so much as the thread of a date stone"
  17,72,"And whosoever was blind in this [life] will be blind in the Hereafter, and further astray from the way"
  17,73,"And they were about to tempt thee away from that which We revealed unto thee, that thou mightest falsely ascribe unto Us something other than it, whereupon they would surely have taken thee as a friend"
  17,74,"And had We not made thee firm, thou wouldst certainly have inclined toward them a little"
  17,75,Then We would have made thee taste double in life and double in death. Then thou wouldst have found for thyself no helper against Us
