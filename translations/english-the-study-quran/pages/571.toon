quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  71,11,He will send the sky upon you with abundant rains
  71,12,"support you with wealth and sons, and make for you gardens and rivers"
  71,13,What ails you that you do not hope for God with dignity
  71,14,seeing that He has created you in stages
  71,15,Have you not considered how God created the seven heavens one upon another
  71,16,and made the moon a light therein and made the sun a lamp
  71,17,And God made you grow forth from the earth like plants
  71,18,Then He will cause you to return to it and bring you forth again
  71,19,And God made the earth an open expanse for you
  71,20,that you may travel spacious paths therein.’”
  71,21,"Noah said, “My Lord they disobeyed me and followed those whose wealth and children increase them in naught but loss.”"
  71,22,And they devised a mighty plot
  71,23,"saying, “Do not leave your gods; do not leave Wadd or Suwa?, or Yaguth, Ya?uq, or Nasr.”"
  71,24,Many indeed have they led astray; and it increases the wrongdoers in naught but error
  71,25,"Because of their iniquities they were drowned, then made to enter a Fire. And then they found no helpers for themselves apart from God"
  71,26,"Noah said, “My Lord, leave not a single disbeliever to dwell upon the earth"
  71,27,"Truly if you leave them, they will mislead Thy servants and will beget naught but disbelieving profligates"
  71,28,"My Lord, forgive me and my parents, whosoever enters my house as a believer, and the believing men and the believing women, and do not increase the wrongdoers in aught but ruin.”"
