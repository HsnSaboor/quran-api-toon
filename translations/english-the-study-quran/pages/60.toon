quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,78,"And there is indeed a group among them who twist their tongues with the Book, that you may suppose it to be from the Book. But it is not from the Book. And they say, “It is from God,” though it is not from God. And they knowingly speak a lie against God"
  3,79,"It is not for any human being, God having given him the Book, judgment, and prophethood, to then say to the people, “Be servants of me instead of God.” Rather, “Be sages, from having taught the Book and from having studied.”"
  3,80,And he would not command you to take the angels and the prophets as lords. Would he command you to disbelief after your having been submitters
  3,81,"And [remember] when God made the covenant of the prophets: “By that which I have given you of a Book and Wisdom, should a messenger then come to you confirming that which is with you, you shall surely believe in him and you shall help him.” He said, “Do you agree and take on My burden on these conditions?” They said, “We agree.” He said, “Bear witness, for I am with you among those who bear witness.”"
  3,82,"Then whosoever turns away after that, they are the iniquitous"
  3,83,"Do they seek other than God’s religion, while whosoever is in the heavens and on the earth submits to Him, willingly or unwillingly, and unto Him they will be returned"
