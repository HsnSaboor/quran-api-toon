  60,12,"O Prophet! When believing women come unto thee, pledging unto thee that they will not ascribe any as partners unto God, nor steal, nor fornicate, nor slay their children, nor bring a slanderous lie that they have fabricated between their hands and feet, nor disobey thee in anything honorable, then accept their pledge and seek God’s Forgiveness for them. Truly God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  60,13,"O you who believe! Do not befriend a people with whom God is wroth; they who have despaired of the Hereafter, just as the disbelievers have despaired of the inhabitants of graves"
  61,1,"Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth glorifies God, and He is the Mighty, the Wise"

  61,3,Grievously odious is it in the Sight of God that you say that which you do not do
  61,4,"Truly God loves those who fight in His way in ranks, as if they were a solid structure"
  61,5,"And [remember] when Moses said unto his people, “O my people! Why do you hurt me, though you know well that I am the Messenger of God unto you?” So when they swerved, God caused their hearts to swerve; and God guides not iniquitous people"
