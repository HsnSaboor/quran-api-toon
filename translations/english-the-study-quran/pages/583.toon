quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,Truly the reverent shall have a place of triumph
  78,32,gardens and vineyards
  78,33,buxom maidens of like age
  78,34,and an overflowing cup
  78,35,They hear therein neither idle talk nor lying—
  78,36,"a recompense from thy Lord, a gift abounding—"
  78,37,"the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and whatsoever is between them, the Compassionate, Whom they have no power to address"
  78,38,"That Day the Spirit and the angels stand in rows, none speaking, save one whom the Compassionate permits and who speaks aright"
  78,39,"That is the True Day. So let whosoever will, take a path of return unto his Lord"
  78,40,"Truly We have warned you of a punishment nigh, on a day when a man beholds what his hands have sent forth, and the disbeliever says, “Oh, would that I were dust!”"
  79,1,By those that wrest violently
  79,2,by those that draw out quickly
  79,3,by those that glide serenely
  79,4,"by those that race to the fore, outstripping"
  79,5,and by those that govern affairs
  79,6,on the Day when the quaker quakes
  79,7,and the successor follows upon it
  79,8,Hearts that Day shall tremble
  79,9,with eyes humbled
  79,10,"They will say, “Are we to be restored as we were before"
  79,11,What! When we have become decayed bones?”
  79,12,"They say, “This, then, would be a ruinous return!”"
  79,13,Yet it shall be but a single cry
  79,14,"then, behold, they will be upon a wide expanse"
  79,15,Hast thou heard tell of Moses
