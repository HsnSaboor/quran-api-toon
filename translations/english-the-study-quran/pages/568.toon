quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,So today he has no loyal friend here
  69,36,"nor food, save filth"
  69,37,"which none eat, save the iniquitous"
  69,38,So I swear by what you see
  69,39,and by what you see not
  69,40,truly it is the speech of a noble messenger
  69,41,and not the speech of a poet. Little do you believe
  69,42,Nor is it the speech of a soothsayer. Little do you reflect
  69,43,It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
  69,44,Had he ascribed any statements to Us
  69,45,We would have taken him by the right hand
  69,46,Then We would have severed his life vein
  69,47,And none among you could have shielded him from it
  69,48,Truly it is a reminder for the reverent
  69,49,And truly We know that among you are those who deny
  69,50,It is a source of regret indeed for the disbelievers
  69,51,It is indeed the truth of certainty
  69,52,"So glorify the Name of thy Lord, the Magnificent"
  70,1,A questioner asked about an impending punishment
  70,2,upon the disbelievers which none can avert
  70,3,"from God, Lord of the ascending ways"
  70,4,Unto Him ascend the angels and the Spirit on a day whose measure is fifty thousand years
  70,5,So be patient with beautiful patience
  70,6,Truly they see it as far off
  70,7,but We see it as nigh
  70,8,On a day when the sky is as molten lead
  70,9,and the mountains are as carded wool
  70,10,and no loyal friend shall ask about a loyal friend
