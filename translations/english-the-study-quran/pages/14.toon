quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,89,"And when there came to them a Book from God, confirming that which they had with them—and aforetime they used to ask for victory over those who disbelieve—so when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it. So may the curse of God be upon the disbelievers"
  2,90,"Evil is that for which they sold their souls, that they should disbelieve in what God sent down, out of envy that God should send down His Grace unto whomsoever He will among His servants. They earn a burden of wrath upon wrath, and the disbelievers shall have a humiliating punishment"
  2,91,"And when it is said unto them, “Believe in what God has sent down,” they say, “We believe in what was sent down to us,” and they disbelieve in what is beyond it, although it is the truth, confirming what is with them. Say, “Then why did you slay the prophets of God aforetime, if you were believers?”"
  2,92,"And indeed Moses brought you clear proofs, but then you took up the calf while he was away, and you were wrongdoers"
  2,93,"And when We made a covenant with you, and raised the Mount over you, “Take hold of what We have given you with strength, and listen!” They said, “We hear, and disobey,” and they were made to drink the calf into their hearts because of their disbelief. Say, “Evil is that which your belief enjoins upon you, if you are believers.”"
