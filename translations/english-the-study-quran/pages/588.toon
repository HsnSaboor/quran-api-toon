quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,Nay! Truly the book of the profligate is in Sijjin
  83,8,And what will apprise thee of Sijjin
  83,9,A book inscribed
  83,10,Woe that Day to the deniers
  83,11,who deny the Day of Judgment
  83,12,which none deny save every sinful transgressor
  83,13,"When Our signs are recited unto him, he says, “Fables of those of old!”"
  83,14,Nay! But that which they used to earn has covered their hearts with rust
  83,15,Nay! Surely on that Day they will be veiled from their Lord
  83,16,Then they will burn in Hellfire
  83,17,"Then it is said unto them, “This is that which you used to deny.”"
  83,18,"Nay, truly the book of the pious is in ?Illiyyun"
  83,19,And what will apprise thee of ?Illiyyun
  83,20,A book inscribed
  83,21,witnessed by those brought nigh
  83,22,Truly the pious shall be in bliss
  83,23,"upon couches, gazing"
  83,24,Thou dost recognize in their faces the splendor of bliss
  83,25,They are given to drink of pure wine sealed
  83,26,whose seal is musk—so for that let the strivers strive—
  83,27,and whose mixture is of Tasnim
  83,28,a spring whence drink those brought nigh
  83,29,Truly those who sinned did laugh at those who believed
  83,30,"When they passed them, they would wink at one another"
  83,31,"And when they returned to their people, they would return blithely"
  83,32,"And when they saw them, they said, “Truly these are astray!”"
  83,33,Though they were not sent as guardians over them
  83,34,So that Day those who believe shall laugh at those who disbelieve
