quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  44,40,"Truly the Day of Division is their tryst, all together"
  44,41,"The Day when no friend will avail a friend in any way, nor will they be helped"
  44,42,"save him unto whom God has been merciful. Truly He is the Mighty, the Merciful"
  44,43,Truly the tree of Zaqqum
  44,44,is the food of the sinner
  44,45,like molten lead boiling in their bellies
  44,46,like the boiling of boiling liquid
  44,47,“Seize him and thrust him into the midst of Hellfire
  44,48,Then pour the punishment of boiling liquid upon his head.”
  44,49,"“Taste! Surely you are the mighty, the noble"
  44,50,This is that which you used to doubt.”
  44,51,Truly the reverent are in a station secure
  44,52,amid gardens and springs
  44,53,"wearing fine silk and rich brocade, facing one another"
  44,54,Thus it is. And We shall wed them to wide-eyed maidens
  44,55,"Therein they call for every fruit, secure"
  44,56,"They taste not death therein, save the first death. And He will shield them from the punishment of Hellfire—"
  44,57,a bounty from thy Lord; that is the great triumph
  44,58,"We have only made this easy upon thy tongue, that haply they may remember"
  44,59,"So be on the watch, for they, too, are on the watch"
