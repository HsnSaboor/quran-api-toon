  40,41,my people! How is it that I call you unto salvation while you call me unto the Fire
  40,42,"You call upon me to disbelieve in God and to ascribe as a partner unto Him that whereof I have no knowledge, whereas I call you unto the Mighty, the Forgiving"
  40,43,"There is no doubt that that unto which you call me has no call in this world or in the Hereafter, and that our return will be unto God, and that the prodigal are the inhabitants of the Fire"
  40,44,You will soon remember what I have said to you. I entrust my affair to God. Truly God sees His servants.”
  40,45,"So God shielded him from the evils of that which they had plotted, while a terrible punishment beset the House of Pharaoh—"
  40,46,"the Fire, to which they are exposed morning and evening. And on the Day when the Hour is come, [it will be said], “Cause the House of Pharaoh to enter the punishment most severe!”"
  40,47,"And when they are arguing with one another in the Fire, the weak will say to those who waxed arrogant, “Truly we were your followers; so can you avail us against any portion of the Fire?”"
  40,48,"Those who waxed arrogant will say, “Truly we are all in it. God has indeed judged between His servants.”"
  40,49,"And those who are in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell, “Call upon your Lord to relieve us from a day of the punishment.”"
