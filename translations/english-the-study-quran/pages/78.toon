quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,7,"Unto the men a share of what parents and kinsfolk leave, and unto the women a share of what parents and kinsfolk leave, be it little or much—a share ordained"
  4,8,"And when kinsfolk, orphans, and the indigent are present at the division, make provision from it for them and speak unto them in an honorable way"
  4,9,Let those who would dread if they left behind their own helpless progeny have fear; let them reverence God and speak justly
  4,10,"Truly those who consume the property of orphans unjustly only consume fire in their bellies, and they will burn in a blazing flame"
  4,11,"God enjoins upon you concerning your children: unto the male a share equal to that of two females; but if there are only daughters, two or more, then unto them is two-thirds of what he leaves; if only one, then unto her a half. And unto his parents—each of the two—a sixth of what he leaves if he has a child; but if he has no child and his parents are his [only] heirs, then unto his mother a third; and if he has brothers, then unto his mother a sixth, after paying any bequest he may have bequeathed or any debt. Your parents or your children—you know not which of them are nearer to you in benefit. [This is] an obligation ordained by God. Truly God is Knowing, Wise"
