  50,40,"And at night glorify Him, and after prostrations"
  50,41,And listen on the Day when the caller calls from near at hand
  50,42,on the Day when they hear the Cry of Truth; that is the Day of coming forth
  50,43,"Truly We give life and We cause death, and unto Us is the journey’s end"

  51,1,By the scatterers as they scatter

  51,4,and by those that apportion the Command
  51,5,verily what you are promised is true
  51,6,and truly the judgment shall come to pass
