quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,Those who stay behind among the believers—except for the disadvantaged—and those who strive in the way of God with their goods and lives are not equal. God favors those who strive with their goods and their lives a degree above those who stay behind. Unto both God has promised that which is most beautiful. But He favors those who strive with a great reward above those who stay behind
  4,96,"degrees conferred by Him, and forgiveness and mercy. Surely God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  4,97,"When the angels take the souls of those who were wronging themselves, [the angels] say, “In what state were you?” They say, “We were weak and oppressed in the land.” [The angels] will say, “Was not God’s earth vast enough that you might have migrated therein?” These shall have their refuge in Hell—what an evil journey’s end"
  4,98,"But not so the [truly] weak and oppressed among the men, women, and children, who neither have access to any means nor are guided to any way"
  4,99,"As for such, it may be that God will pardon them, for God is Pardoning, Forgiving"
  4,100,"Whosoever migrates in the way of God will find upon the earth many a refuge and abundance, and whosoever forsakes his home, emigrating unto God and His Messenger, and death overtakes him, his reward will fall upon God, and God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  4,101,"When you travel upon the earth, there is no blame upon you for shortening your prayers if you fear that the disbelievers may attack you; verily the disbelievers are your manifest enemy"
