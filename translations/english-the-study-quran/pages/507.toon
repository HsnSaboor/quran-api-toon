quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,Those who disbelieve and turn from the way of God—He has made their deeds go astray
  47,2,"And those who believe and perform righteous deeds, and believe in what has been sent down unto Muhammad—and it is the truth from their Lord—He has absolved them of their evil deeds and set their state aright"
  47,3,That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and because those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus does God set forth for mankind their likenesses
  47,4,"When you meet those who disbelieve, strike at their necks; then, when you have overwhelmed them, tighten the bonds. Then free them graciously or hold them for ransom, till war lays down its burdens. Thus [shall it be]. And if God willed, He would take vengeance upon them, but that He may test some of you by means of others, And as for those who are slain in the way of God, He will not make their deeds go astray"
  47,5,He will guide them and set their state aright
  47,6,"and cause them to enter the Garden, having made it known to them"
  47,7,"you who believe! If you help God, He will help you and make firm your steps"
  47,8,"As for those who disbelieve, wretched are they, and He has made their deeds go astray"
  47,9,"That is because they were averse to that which God sent down, so He made their deeds come to naught"
  47,10,Have they not journeyed upon the earth and observed how those before them fared in the end? God destroyed them; and the disbelievers shall have the like thereof
  47,11,"That is because God is Master of those who believe, and because the disbelievers have no master"
