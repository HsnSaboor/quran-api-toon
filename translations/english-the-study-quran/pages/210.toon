quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,15,"And when Our signs are recited unto them as clear proofs, those who anticipate not the meeting with Us say, “Bring a Quran other than this, or alter it.” Say, “It is not for me to alter it of my own accord. I follow only that which is revealed unto me. Truly I fear, should I disobey my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous day.”"
  10,16,"Say, “Had God willed, I would not have recited it unto you; nor would He have made it known to you. Indeed, I tarried among you for a lifetime before it. Do you not understand?”"
  10,17,And who does greater wrong than one who fabricates a lie against God or denies His signs? Surely the guilty will not prosper
  10,18,"They worship apart from God that which neither harms them nor benefits them. And they say, “These are our intercessors with God.” Say, “Would you inform God about something in the heavens or on the earth that He does not know? Glory be to Him and exalted is He above the partners they ascribe!”"
  10,19,"Mankind was but one community, then they differed. And if not for a Word that had preceded from thy Lord, judgment would have been made between them concerning that wherein they differed"
  10,20,"And they say, “Why has no sign been sent down unto him from his Lord?” Say, “Truly the Unseen belongs to God alone. So wait! Truly I am among those waiting along with you.”"
