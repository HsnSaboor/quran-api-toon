  26,207,of what avail to them will be that which they were made to enjoy
  26,208,And never did We destroy a town save that it had warners
  26,209,as a reminder; and We did no wrong
  26,210,And the satans did not descend with it
  26,211,"nor is it fitting for them, nor are they able"
  26,212,"Indeed, they are debarred from hearing [it]"
  26,213,"So call not upon another god along with God, lest thou be among the punished"
  26,214,"And warn thy tribe, thy nearest kin"
  26,215,and lower thy wing to the believers who follow thee
  26,216,"And should they disobey thee, say, “Truly I am quit of that which you do.”"
  26,217,"And trust in the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,218,"Who sees thee when thou standest [to pray]"
  26,219,and thy movement amid those who prostrate
  26,220,"Truly He is the Hearing, the Knowing"
  26,221,Shall I inform thee of those upon whom the satans descend
  26,222,They descend upon every sinful liar
  26,223,"eavesdropping, and most of them are liars"
  26,224,"And as for the poets, the errant follow them"
  26,225,Hast thou not considered that they wander in every valley
  26,226,and that they say what they do not do
  26,227,"Not so those who believe and perform righteous deeds, and remember God much, and help one another after having been wronged. And those who do wrong shall know to what homecoming they will return"
