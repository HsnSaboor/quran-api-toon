quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,"How can you disbelieve, while God’s signs are recited unto you and His Messenger is among you? And whosoever holds fast to God is indeed guided unto a straight path"
  3,102,"O you who believe! Reverence God as He should be reverenced, and die not except in submission"
  3,103,"And hold fast to the rope of God, all together, and be not divided. Remember the Blessing of God upon you, when you were enemies and He joined your hearts, such that you became brothers by His Blessing. You were on the brink of a pit of fire and He delivered you from it. Thus does God make clear unto you His signs, that haply you may be rightly guided"
  3,104,"Let there be among you a community calling to the good, enjoining right, and forbidding wrong. It is they who shall prosper"
  3,105,And be not like those who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them. And it is they who shall have a great punishment
  3,106,"on the Day when faces whiten and faces blacken. As for those whose faces blacken, “Did you disbelieve after having believed? Then taste the punishment for having disbelieved.”"
  3,107,"And as for those whose faces whiten, they will be in the Mercy of God, abiding therein"
  3,108,"These are God’s signs which We recite unto thee in truth, and God desires no wrong for the worlds"
