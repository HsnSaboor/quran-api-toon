  59,10,"And those who came after them say, “Our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith, and place no rancor in our hearts toward those who believe. Our Lord! Truly Thou art Kind, Merciful.”"
  59,11,"Hast thou not seen those who act with hypocrisy, saying to their brothers who disbelieve among the People of the Book, “If you are expelled, surely we shall go forth with you. And we shall never obey anyone against you. And if you are fought, we shall help you.” God bears witness that they are surely liars"
  59,12,"Were they expelled, they would not go forth with them, and were they fought, they would not help them. And were they to help them, they would surely turn their backs. Then they would not be helped"

  59,14,"They will not fight you all together, save in fortified towns or from behind walls. Their might is fierce among themselves. You suppose that they are together; yet their hearts are divided. That is because they are a people who do not understand"
  59,15,like those who shortly before them tasted the evil consequences of their affair—and theirs shall be a painful punishment—
  59,16,"like Satan when he says unto man, “Disbelieve!” Then when he disbelieves, he says, “Surely I am quit of you. Truly I fear God, Lord of the worlds.”"
