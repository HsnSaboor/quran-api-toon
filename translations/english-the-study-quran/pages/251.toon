quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  13,14,"Unto Him is the supplication of truth; and those whom they supplicate apart from Him answer them not in the least, save as one who stretches forth his palms toward water that it may reach his mouth, though it never reaches him. And the supplication of the disbelievers is naught but astray"
  13,15,"And unto God prostrates whosoever is in the heavens and on the earth, willingly or unwillingly, as do their shadows in the morning and the evening"
  13,16,"Say, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?” Say, “God.” Say, “Then have you taken, apart from Him, protectors who have no power over what benefit or harm may come to themselves?” Say, “Are the blind and the seer equal, or are darkness and light equal?” Or have they ascribed unto God partners who have created the like of His creation, such that that creation seems alike to them? Say, “God is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Paramount.”"
  13,17,"He sends down water from the sky, so that the riverbeds flow according to their measure and the torrent carries a swelling froth; and from that which they kindle in the fire, seeking ornament or pleasure, is a froth like unto it. Thus does God set forth truth and falsehood. As for the froth, it passes away as dross. And as for that which benefits mankind, it remains on the earth. Thus does God set forth parables"
  13,18,"Those who answer their Lord shall have that which is most beautiful. But those who answer Him not—were they to possess all that is on the earth and the like of it besides, they would seek to ransom themselves thereby. For them there shall be an evil reckoning. Their refuge is Hell. What an evil resting place"
