  68,16,We shall brand him on the snout
  68,17,"Truly We tried them, just as We tried the owners of the garden who vowed that they would harvest its fruit in the morning"
  68,18,And they made no exception
  68,19,Whereupon a visitation from your Lord came upon it while they slept
  68,20,such that it became like a garden plucked

  68,39,Or do you have oaths binding upon Us until the Day of Resurrection that you shall have whatever you ordain
  68,40,Ask them which of them shall vouch for that
  68,41,Or do they have partners? Then let them bring their partners if they are truthful
  68,42,"On the Day when the shank is laid bare and they are called to prostrate, yet are not able"
