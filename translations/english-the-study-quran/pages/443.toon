quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,And a sign unto them is that We carried their progeny in the full-laden Ark
  36,42,And We created for them the like thereof upon which they ride
  36,43,"And if We will, We drown them, such that they would have none to call upon and would not be saved"
  36,44,save as a mercy from Us and an enjoyment for a while
  36,45,"And when it is said unto them, “Be mindful of that which is before you and of that which is behind you, that haply you may receive mercy.”"
  36,46,Never did a sign from among the signs of their Lord come unto them but that they turned away from it
  36,47,"And when it is said unto them, “Spend of that wherewith God has provided you,” those who disbelieve say to those who believe, “Are we to feed one whom, if God willed, He would feed him? You are in naught but manifest error.”"
  36,48,"And they say, “When will this promise come to pass, if you are truthful?”"
  36,49,They await naught but a single cry that will seize them while they dispute among themselves
  36,50,"and then they can make no bequest, nor return to their people"
  36,51,"And the trumpet will be blown. Then, behold, they will rush forth from their graves unto their Lord"
  36,52,"They will say, “Oh, woe unto us! Who has raised us from our place of sleep?” “This is that which the Compassionate did promise; and the message bearers spoke true.”"
  36,53,"There shall be but a single cry. Then, behold, they will all be arraigned before Us"
  36,54,"This day no soul will be wronged in any way, and you will not be recompensed, save for that which you used to do"
