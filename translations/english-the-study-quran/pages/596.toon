quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,"which none shall enter, save the most wretched"
  92,16,who denies and turns away
  92,17,And the most reverent shall be removed from it
  92,18,who gives his wealth to purify
  92,19,not recompensing any for a favor thereby
  92,20,"save for seeking the Face of his Lord, the Most High"
  92,21,and surely he shall be content
  93,1,By the morning brightness
  93,2,and by the night when still
  93,3,thy Lord has not forsaken thee; nor does He despise
  93,4,And the Hereafter shall be better for thee than this life
  93,5,"And surely thy Lord shall give unto thee, and thou shalt be content"
  93,6,Did He not find thee an orphan and shelter
  93,7,find thee astray and guide
  93,8,and find thee in need and enrich
  93,9,"So as for the orphan, scorn not"
  93,10,"And as for one who requests, repel not"
  93,11,"And as for the blessing of thy Lord, proclaim"
  94,1,Did We not expand for thee thy breast
  94,2,and lift from thee thy burden
  94,3,that weighed heavily upon thy back
  94,4,And did We not elevate thy renown
  94,5,For truly with hardship comes ease
  94,6,Truly with hardship comes ease
  94,7,"So when thou art free, exert thyself"
  94,8,and let thy desire be for thy Lord
