quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,"upon couches, gazing"
  83,36,Have the disbelievers been requited for that which they used to do
  84,1,When the sky is rent asunder
  84,2,"and hearkens unto its Lord, as in truth it must"
  84,3,and when the earth is stretched out
  84,4,"and casts forth what is in it, emptying itself"
  84,5,"and hearkens unto its Lord, as in truth it must. j"
  84,6,"O mankind! Truly thou art laboring unto thy Lord laboriously, and shall meet Him"
  84,7,As for one who is given his book in his right hand
  84,8,he will be reckoned with an easy reckoning
  84,9,and will return to his people joyful
  84,10,But as for one who is given his book from behind his back
  84,11,he will cry out for destruction
  84,12,and will enter a Blaze
  84,13,Truly among his people he was joyful
  84,14,Truly he thought that he would never return
  84,15,Nay! Truly his Lord was watchful of him
  84,16,So I swear by the twilight
  84,17,by the night and what it enshrouds
  84,18,and by the moon when full
  84,19,thou wilt surely journey from stage to stage
  84,20,So what ails them that they believe not
  84,21,"and that when the Quran is recited unto them, they do not prostrate"
  84,22,Nay! Those who disbelieve deny
  84,23,But God knows best what they conceal
  84,24,So give them glad tidings of a painful punishment
  84,25,save those who believe and perform righteous deeds; theirs shall be a reward unceasing
