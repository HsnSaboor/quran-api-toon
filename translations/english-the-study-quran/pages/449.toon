  37,77,and We made his progeny endure
  37,78,"and We left [a blessing] upon him among later generations"
  37,79,“Peace be upon Noah throughout the worlds.”
  37,80,Thus do We recompense the virtuous
  37,81,Truly he was among Our believing servants
  37,82,Then We drowned the others
  37,83,And surely among his party was Abraham
  37,84,when he came unto his Lord with a sound heart
  37,85,"when he said unto his father and his people, “What do you worship"
  37,86,"Is it a perversion, gods apart from God, that you desire"
  37,87,"What, then, think you of the Lord of the worlds?”"
  37,88,Then he cast a glance at the stars
  37,89,"and said, “Truly I am sick.”"
  37,90,But they turned their backs on him
  37,91,"Then he went quietly to their gods and said, “Will you not eat"
  37,92,What ails you that you speak not?”
  37,93,"Then he turned upon them, striking with his right hand"
  37,94,Then they came to him rushing
  37,95,"He said, “Do you worship that which you carve"
  37,96,while God created you and that which you make?”
  37,97,"They said, “Erect a building for him and cast him into the fire.”"
  37,98,"They desired to scheme against him, so We made them the lowest"
  37,99,"And he said, “Truly I am going unto my Lord. He will guide me"
  37,100,"My Lord, give unto me from among the righteous.”"
  37,101,So We gave him glad tidings of a gentle son
  37,102,"When he had become old enough to partake of his father’s endeavors, Abraham said, “O my son! I see while dreaming that I am to sacrifice you. So consider, what do you see?” He replied, “O my father! Do as you are commanded. You will find me, God willing, among those who are patient.”"
