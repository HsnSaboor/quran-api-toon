quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun is enfolded
  81,2,and when the stars fade away
  81,3,when the mountains are set in motion
  81,4,and when pregnant camels are abandoned
  81,5,when the wild beasts are gathered
  81,6,and when the seas are made to swell over
  81,7,when the souls are coupled
  81,8,and when the female infant buried alive is asked
  81,9,for what sin she was slain
  81,10,when the pages are spread
  81,11,and when Heaven is laid bare
  81,12,when Hellfire is kindled
  81,13,and when the Garden is brought nigh
  81,14,each soul shall know what it has made ready
  81,15,So I swear by those receding
  81,16,those that move and set
  81,17,by the night as it approaches
  81,18,and by the morning as it breathes
  81,19,Truly it is the speech of a noble messenger
  81,20,"possessed of strength, before the Possessor of the Throne, of high rank"
  81,21,"obeyed, trustworthy withal"
  81,22,Your companion is not possessed
  81,23,He surely saw him upon the clear horizon
  81,24,And he does not withhold grudgingly the Unseen
  81,25,Nor is it the speech of a satan outcast
  81,26,So where are you going
  81,27,It is naught but a reminder for the worlds
  81,28,for those of you who will to go straight
  81,29,"And you do not will but that God, Lord of the worlds, wills"
