quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and its morning brightness
  91,2,by the moon when following it
  91,3,by the day when disclosing it
  91,4,by the night when enshrouding it
  91,5,by the sky and the One Who established it
  91,6,by the earth and the One Who spread it
  91,7,by the soul and the One Who fashioned it
  91,8,and inspired it as to what makes it iniquitous or reverent
  91,9,"Indeed, he prospers who purifies it"
  91,10,And indeed he fails who obscures it
  91,11,Thamud denied in their rebelliousness
  91,12,when the most wretched of them was dispatched
  91,13,"So the messenger of God said to them, “[This is] the she-camel of God; give her drink!”"
  91,14,"But they denied him, then hamstrung her. So their Lord crushed them for their sin, then leveled it"
  91,15,for He fears not the consequence thereof
  92,1,By the night as it enshrouds
  92,2,by the day as it discloses
  92,3,by Him Who created the male and the female
  92,4,truly your endeavors are diverse
  92,5,As for one who gives and is reverent
  92,6,and attests to what is most beautiful
  92,7,We shall ease his way unto ease
  92,8,And as for one who is miserly and deems himself beyond need
  92,9,and denies what is most beautiful
  92,10,We shall ease his way unto hardship
  92,11,and his wealth shall not avail him when he perishes
  92,12,Truly Ours it is to give guidance
  92,13,and truly unto Us belong the Hereafter and this world
  92,14,Thus have I warned you of a raging Fire
