quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"And were We to send a wind and they were to see it turn yellow, after that they would surely disbelieve"
  30,52,Surely thou dost not make the dead to hear; nor dost thou make the deaf to hear the call when they turn their backs
  30,53,"nor dost thou guide the blind from their straying. Thou makest none to hear, save those who believe in Our signs and are submitters"
  30,54,"God is He Who created you from weakness, then ordained strength after weakness, then ordained weakness and old age after strength. He creates whatsoever He will, and He is the Knowing, the Powerful"
  30,55,"And on the Day when the Hour is come, the guilty will swear that they had tarried naught but an hour; thus were they perverted"
  30,56,"And those who have been given knowledge and belief will say, “Indeed, you tarried in God’s Book until the Day of Resurrection; and this is the Day of Resurrection! But you knew not.”"
  30,57,On that Day the excuses of those who do wrong will benefit them not; nor can they make amends
  30,58,"And indeed We have set forth for mankind in this Quran every kind of parable. And if thou bringest them a sign, those who disbelieve will surely say, “You make naught but false claims.”"
  30,59,Thus does God seal the hearts of those who know not
  30,60,So be patient. God’s Promise is indeed true. And let not those without certainty disquiet thee
