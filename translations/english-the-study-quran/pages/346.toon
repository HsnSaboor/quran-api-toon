quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,60,and those who give what they give while their hearts quake with fear that they shall return to their Lord—
  23,61,"it is they who hasten toward good deeds, and are foremost in them"
  23,62,"And We task no soul beyond its capacity, and with Us is a Book that speaks in truth. And they shall not be wronged"
  23,63,"Nay, indeed their hearts are engrossed away from this, and they have other deeds besides which they undertake"
  23,64,"till, when We seize those of them who lived in luxury with the punishment, behold, they shall implore"
  23,65,Implore not today! Truly you will not be helped by Us
  23,66,"My signs were recited unto you, but you used to turn on your heels"
  23,67,"waxing arrogant on account thereof, talking foolishly by night"
  23,68,"Have they not contemplated the Word, or has there come unto them that which came not unto their forefathers"
  23,69,"Or do they not know their Messenger, and so deny him"
  23,70,"Or do they say, “He is possessed?” Rather, he has brought them the truth, but most of them are averse to the truth"
  23,71,"Were the truth to follow their caprices, the heavens and the earth and those therein would have been corrupted. Nay, We gave them their reminder, but they turned away from their reminder"
  23,72,"Dost thou ask any recompense of them? For thy Lord’s recompense is better, and He is the best of providers"
  23,73,Surely thou callest them unto a straight path
  23,74,And truly those who believe not in the Hereafter are deviating from the path
