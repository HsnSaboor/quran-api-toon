quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  73,1,O thou enwrapped
  73,2,"Stand vigil at night, save a little"
  73,3,half of it or reduce it a little
  73,4,or add to it; and recite the Quran in a measured pace
  73,5,Truly We shall soon cast upon thee a weighty Word
  73,6,Truly the vigil of the night is firmest in tread and most upright for speech
  73,7,For truly by day you have lengthy affairs
  73,8,So remember the Name of thy Lord and devote thyself to Him with complete devotion—
  73,9,"Lord of the East and the West, there is no god but He, so take Him as a guardian"
  73,10,Bear patiently that which they say and take leave of them in a beautiful manner
  73,11,"Leave to Me the deniers living in luxury, and be gentle with them for a while"
  73,12,Truly with Us are fetters and Hellfire
  73,13,food that chokes and a painful punishment—
  73,14,"on a day when the earth and the mountains shake, and the mountains will be like heaps of shifting sand"
  73,15,"We have indeed sent you a messenger as a witness concerning you, just as We sent unto Pharaoh a messenger"
  73,16,"But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger, so We seized him with a torrential seizing"
  73,17,"So if you disbelieve, how will you guard against a day that would make children gray-haired"
  73,18,The sky shall be rent asunder thereon. His Promise shall be fulfilled
