quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the dawn
  89,2,by the ten nights
  89,3,by the even and the odd
  89,4,and by the night as it recedes
  89,5,is there an oath therein for one who is mindful
  89,6,Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with ?Ad
  89,7,Iram the pillared
  89,8,the like of which was never created in all the land
  89,9,Thamud who hollowed the rocks in the valley
  89,10,and Pharaoh of the tent poles
  89,11,who tyrannized the land
  89,12,and increased corruption therein
  89,13,So thy Lord poured upon them the scourge of punishment
  89,14,Truly thy Lord lies in ambush
  89,15,"As for man, whenever his Lord tests him, then honors him and blesses him, he says, “My Lord has honored me.”"
  89,16,"And as for whenever He tries him and straitens his provision, he says, “My Lord has abased me.”"
  89,17,"Nay, but you honor not the orphan"
  89,18,nor urge you the feeding of the indigent
  89,19,You devour inheritance with rapacious devouring
  89,20,and love wealth with abounding love
  89,21,"Nay, but when the earth is ground up, grinding upon grinding"
  89,22,"and your Lord comes with the angels, row upon row"
  89,23,and Hell is brought forth that Day; that Day man will remember; yet whence will that remembrance avail him
