quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,"And Our Command is naught but one, like the blinking of an eye"
  54,51,We have indeed destroyed the likes of you; so is there any who remembers
  54,52,Everything that they have done is in the scriptures
  54,53,everything small and great is inscribed
  54,54,Truly the reverent are amidst Gardens and a stream
  54,55,upon a seat of truth before an Omnipotent King
  55,1,The Compassionate
  55,2,taught the Quran
  55,3,created man
  55,4,taught him speech
  55,5,The sun and the moon are upon a reckoning
  55,6,And the stars and the trees prostrate
  55,7,Heaven He has raised and the Balance He has set
  55,8,that you transgress not in the balance
  55,9,So set right the weight and fall not short in the balance
  55,10,The earth has He laid down for creatures
  55,11,Therein are fruit and date palms bearing sheaths
  55,12,husked grains and fragrant herbs
  55,13,So which of your Lord’s boons do you two deny
  55,14,"He created man from dried clay, like earthen vessels"
  55,15,and He created jinn from smokeless fire
  55,16,So which of your Lord’s boons do you two deny
