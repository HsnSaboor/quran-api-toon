quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  24,28,"But if you find not anyone therein, then enter them not until permission is granted you. And if it is said to you, “Turn back,” then turn back. That is purer for you, and God knows what you do"
  24,29,There is no blame upon you for entering uninhabited houses wherein there is some good for you. And God knows what you disclose and what you conceal
  24,30,Tell the believing men to lower their eyes and guard their private parts. That is purer for them. Surely God is Aware of whatsoever they do
  24,31,"And tell the believing women to lower their eyes and to guard their private parts, and to not display their adornment except that which is visible thereof. And let them draw their kerchiefs over their breasts, and not display their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbands’ fathers, or their sons, or their husbands’ sons, or their brothers, or their brothers’ sons, or their sisters’ sons, or their women, or those whom their right hands possess, or male attendants free of desire, or children who are innocent of the private areas of women. Nor let them stamp their feet such that the ornaments they conceal become known. And repent unto God all together, O believers, that haply you may prosper"
