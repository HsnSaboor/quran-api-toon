quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  58,7,"Hast thou not considered that God knows whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth? There is no secret converse among three, but that He is their fourth, nor among five, but that He is their sixth, nor less than that, nor more, but that He is with them wheresoever they are. Then on the Day of Resurrection He will inform them of that which they did. Truly God is Knower of all things"
  58,8,"Hast thou not seen those who were forbidden from secretly conversing then returned to that which they had been forbidden, secretly conversing with a view to sin, enmity, and disobeying the Messenger? And when they come to thee and greet thee, they greet thee in a manner that God has not greeted thee and say within themselves, “Why does God not punish us for what we say?” Hell suffices them, burning therein. What an evil journey’s end"
  58,9,"O you who believe! If you converse in secret, then do not converse in secret with a view to sin, enmity, and disobeying the Messenger; converse in secret with a view to piety and reverence. And reverence God, unto Whom you shall be gathered"
  58,10,"Secret converse is only from Satan, so that those who believe may grieve; yet he harms them not a whit, save by God’s Leave. And in God let the believers trust"
  58,11,"O you who believe! When it is said unto you, “Make room for one another in the assemblies,” then make room, and God will make room for you. And when it is said, “Rise,” then rise, and God will raise in degrees those among you who believe and those who have been given knowledge. God is Aware of whatsoever you do"
