quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"And when it is said unto them, “Come! The Messenger of God will ask forgiveness for you,” they twist their heads, and thou seest them turning away in arrogance"
  63,6,It is the same for them whether thou askest forgiveness for them or thou askest forgiveness for them not; God will never forgive them. Truly God guides not iniquitous people
  63,7,"They are the ones who say, “Do not spend on those who are with the Messenger of God, that they may disperse.” Yet to God belong the treasuries of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites comprehend not"
  63,8,"They say, “If we return to Madinah, the mightier will surely expel the weaker therefrom.” Yet unto God belongs the might and unto His Messenger and the believers, but the hypocrites know not"
  63,9,"O you who believe! Let neither your property nor your children divert you from the remembrance of God. Whosoever does so, it is they who are the losers"
  63,10,"And spend of that which We have provided you before death comes upon one of you and he says, “My Lord, wouldst that Thou grant me reprieve till a term nigh, that I may give charity and be among the righteous!”"
  63,11,Yet God will not grant any soul reprieve when its term has come. And God is Aware of whatsoever you do
