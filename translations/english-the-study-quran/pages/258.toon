  14,19,"Hast thou not considered that God created the heavens and the earth in truth? If He wills, He can remove you and bring a new creation"
  14,20,and that is no great matter for God
  14,21,"They will appear before God all together, and the weak will say to those who waxed arrogant, “Truly we were your followers; so can you avail us in any way against the Punishment of God?” They will say, “Had God guided us, we would have guided you. It is the same for us whether we are anxious or patient; for us there is no refuge.”"
  14,22,"And Satan will say, when the matter has been decreed, “Verily God made you the Promise of truth; and I made you a promise, but I failed you. And I had no authority over you, save that I called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves. I cannot respond to your cries for help; nor can you respond to my cries for help. Truly I disbelieved in your ascribing me as partner aforetime. As for the wrongdoers, surely theirs shall be a painful punishment.”"
  14,23,"Those who believe and perform righteous deeds shall be made to enter Gardens with rivers running below, abiding therein by the leave of their Lord. Their greeting therein shall be, “Peace!”"
  14,24,"Hast thou not considered how God sets forth a parable? A good word is as a good tree: its roots firm and its branches in the sky"
