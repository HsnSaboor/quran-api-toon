quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,Truly he reflected and determined
  74,19,May he perish for how he determined
  74,20,then may he perish for how he determined
  74,21,Then he beheld
  74,22,Then he frowned and scowled
  74,23,"Then he turned his back, and waxed arrogant"
  74,24,"and said, “This is naught but sorcery handed down"
  74,25,this is naught but the speech of a human being.”
  74,26,I shall cast him into Saqar
  74,27,And what will apprise thee of Saqar
  74,28,"It spares not, nor leaves behind"
  74,29,It scorches the human being
  74,30,Over it are nineteen
  74,31,"And We have appointed none but angels as wardens of the Fire; and We have not appointed their number save as a trial for those who disbelieve, to grant certainty to those who have been given the Book and increase in faith those who believe; and that those who were given the Book and the believers will not doubt; and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the disbelievers will say, “What does God desire by this as a parable?” Thus does God lead astray whomsoever He will and guide whomsoever He will. And none knows the hosts of thy Lord but He. It is but a reminder for the human being"
  74,32,Nay! By the moon
  74,33,by the night as it withdraws
  74,34,and by the morning as it brightens
  74,35,truly it is one of the greatest
  74,36,as a warner to the human being
  74,37,for those of you who wish to go forth or stay behind
  74,38,Every soul is held in pledge for what it has earned
  74,39,save the companions of the right
  74,40,"in Gardens, questioning one another"
  74,41,about the guilty
  74,42,“What led you into Saqar?”
  74,43,"They say, “We were not among those who prayed"
  74,44,nor did we feed the indigent
  74,45,and we engaged in vain discourse with those who do the same
  74,46,and we denied the Day of Judgment
  74,47,until certainty came upon us.”
