  11,7,"He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, while His Throne was upon the water, that He may try you as to which of you is most virtuous in deed. Yet if thou sayest, “Truly you shall be resurrected after death,” the disbelievers will surely say, “This is naught but manifest sorcery!”"
  11,8,"And if We grant them reprieve from the punishment for a limited time, they will surely say, “What holds it back?” Behold! On the day when it comes upon them, it shall not be turned away from them, and that which they used to mock will beset them"
  11,9,"And if We cause man to taste Mercy from Us, and then withdraw it from him, verily he is despondent, ungrateful"
  11,10,"And if We cause him to taste some favor after adversity has befallen him, he will surely say, “The evils have gone from me.” Verily he is exultant, boastful"
  11,11,save those who are patient and perform righteous deeds; it is they for whom there shall be forgiveness and a great reward
  11,12,"Perchance thou mightest omit some of that which We have revealed unto thee, and thy breast might be constrained because they say, “Why has no treasure been sent down upon him, or an angel not come with him?” Thou art only a warner, and God is Guardian over all things"
