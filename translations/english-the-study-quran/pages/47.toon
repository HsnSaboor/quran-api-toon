quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"Those who devour usury shall not rise except as one rises who is felled by the touch of Satan. That is because they say, “Buying and selling are simply like usury,” though God has permitted buying and selling and forbidden usury. One who, after receiving counsel from his Lord, desists shall have what is past and his affair goes to God. And as for those who go back, they are the inhabitants of the Fire, abiding therein"
  2,276,God blights usury and causes acts of charity to grow. And God loves not any sinful ingrate
  2,277,"Truly those who believe, perform righteous deeds, maintain the prayer, and give the alms shall have their reward with their Lord. No fear shall come upon them, nor shall they grieve"
  2,278,"O you who believe! Reverence God, and leave what remains of usury, if you are believers"
  2,279,"And if you do not, then take notice of a war from God and His Messenger. If you repent, you shall have the principal of your wealth, and you shall neither wrong nor be wronged"
  2,280,"And if one is in difficult circumstances, let there be a respite until there is ease, and it is better for you to give [it] as charity, if you but knew"
  2,281,"And be mindful of a day when you shall be returned to God. Then every soul will be paid in full for what it earned, and they shall not be wronged"
