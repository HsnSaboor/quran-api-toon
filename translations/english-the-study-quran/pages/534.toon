quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  55,68,"In each are fruits, date palms, and pomegranates"
  55,69,So which of your Lord’s boons do you two deny
  55,70,Therein are good and beautiful ones
  55,71,so which of your Lord’s boons do you two deny
  55,72,Maidens secluded in pavilions
  55,73,so which of your Lord’s boons do you two deny
  55,74,Untouched as yet by man or jinn
  55,75,so which of your Lord’s boons do you two deny
  55,76,They recline upon green cushions and beautiful wonders
  55,77,So which of your Lord’s boons do you two deny
  55,78,"Blessed is the Name of thy Lord, Possessed of Majesty and Bounty"
  56,1,When the Event befalls
  56,2,none shall deny its befalling
  56,3,"abasing, exalting"
  56,4,When the earth is shaken violently
  56,5,and the mountains are pulverized to powder
  56,6,such that they become scattered dust
  56,7,and you shall be of three kinds
  56,8,the companions of the right; what of the companions of the right
  56,9,And the companions of the left; what of the companions of the left
  56,10,And the foremost shall be the foremost
  56,11,They are the ones brought nigh
  56,12,in Gardens of bliss—
  56,13,many from those of old
  56,14,and few from those of later times—
  56,15,upon embroidered couches
  56,16,"reclining upon them, facing one another"
