quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,Thus the intercession of the intercessors will avail them not
  74,49,So what ails them that they turn away from the Reminder
  74,50,as if they were frightened asses
  74,51,fleeing from a lion
  74,52,"Rather, every man among them desires to be given pages unfolded"
  74,53,Nay! But they fear not the Hereafter
  74,54,Yea! Truly it is a reminder
  74,55,"So let whosoever will, remember it"
  74,56,"And they remember not, save as God wills. He is most worthy of reverence and most worthy of granting forgiveness"
  75,1,swear by the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,And I swear by the blaming soul
  75,3,Does man suppose that We shall not gather his bones
  75,4,Nay! But We are able to fashion even his fingers and toes
  75,5,But man desires to defile what lies before him
  75,6,"asking, “When is the Day of Resurrection?”"
  75,7,Then when the eyes are dazzled
  75,8,and the moon is eclipsed
  75,9,and the sun and the moon are brought together—
  75,10,"that Day man will say, “Where is the escape?”"
  75,11,Nay! But there shall be no refuge
  75,12,Unto your Lord that Day is the dwelling place
  75,13,Man shall be informed that Day of that which he has sent forth and of that which he has left behind
  75,14,"Indeed, man shall be a testimony against himself"
  75,15,though he proffers his excuses
  75,16,Move not thy tongue therewith to hasten it
  75,17,Surely it is for Us to gather it and to recite it
  75,18,"So when We recite it, follow its recitation"
  75,19,Then surely it is for Us to explain it
