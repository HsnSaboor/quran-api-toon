  26,185,"They said, “You are but one of the bewitched"
  26,186,"You are naught but a human being like us, and indeed we deem you to be among the liars"
  26,187,"so make fragments from the sky fall upon us, if you are among the truthful.”"
  26,188,"He said, “My Lord knows best what you do.”"
  26,189,"So they denied him, and the punishment of the day of gloom seized them. Truly it was the punishment of a tremendous day"
  26,190,"Truly in that is a sign, but most of them are not believers"
  26,191,"And truly thy Lord is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,192,And truly it is a revelation of the Lord of the worlds

  26,194,upon thine heart—that thou mayest be among the warners—

  26,203,"Then they will say, “Will we be granted respite?”"
  26,204,Do they seek to hasten Our Punishment
  26,205,"Consider: if We grant them enjoyment for years"
  26,206,and there comes upon them that which they were promised
