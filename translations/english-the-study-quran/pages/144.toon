quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,125,"Whomsoever God wishes to guide, He expands his breast for submission. And whomsoever He wishes to lead astray, He makes his breast narrow and constricted, as if he were climbing to the sky. Thus does God heap defilement upon those who do not believe"
  6,126,"This is the path of thy Lord, made straight. We have expounded the signs for a people who take heed"
  6,127,"Theirs shall be the Abode of Peace with their Lord, and He shall be their Protector, because of that which they used to do"
  6,128,"On the Day when He shall gather them all together [He shall say], “O company of jinn! Many among mankind have you claimed.” And their friends among mankind will say, “Our Lord! We have profited from each other, but now we have reached our term which Thou hadst appointed for us.” He will say, “The Fire is your abode, to abide therein, except as God wills. Truly thy Lord is Wise, Knowing.”"
  6,129,Thus do We make the wrongdoers allies of one another because of that which they used to earn
  6,130,"“O company of jinn and human beings! Did not messengers come unto you from among yourselves, recounting unto you My signs, and warning you of the meeting with this your Day?” They will say, “We bear witness against ourselves.” The life of this world deluded them, and they bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers"
  6,131,That is because thy Lord would never destroy towns for their wrongdoing while their people were heedless
