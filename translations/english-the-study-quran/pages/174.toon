quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  7,179,"We have indeed created for Hell many among jinn and men: they have hearts with which they understand not; they have eyes with which they see not; and they have ears with which they hear not. Such as these are like cattle. Nay, they are even further astray. It is they who are heedless"
  7,180,"Unto God belong the Most Beautiful Names; so call Him by them, and leave those who deviate with regard to His Names. Soon they shall be recompensed for that which they used to do"
  7,181,"And among those We have created, there is a community that guides by the truth and does justice thereby"
  7,182,"And as for those who deny Our signs, We shall lead them on little by little, whence they know not"
  7,183,And I will grant them respite; truly My scheme is firm
  7,184,Have they not reflected? There is no madness in their companion. He is naught but a clear warner
  7,185,"Or have they not contemplated the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and what things God has created, and that their term may already have drawn nigh? So in what discourse after this will they believe"
  7,186,"Whomsoever God leads astray, no guide has he. And He leaves them to wander confused in their rebellion"
  7,187,"They question thee about the Hour, when it will set in. Say, “Knowledge thereof lies only with my Lord. None save He shall manifest it at its proper time. Heavy shall it weigh upon the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you but suddenly.” They question thee as if thou knew it well. Say, “Knowledge thereof lies only with God, but most of mankind know not.”"
