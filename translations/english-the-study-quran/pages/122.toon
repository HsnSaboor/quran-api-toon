quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"And when they hear that which was sent down unto the Messenger, thou seest their eyes overflow with tears because of the truth they recognize. They say, “Our Lord, we believe, so inscribe us among the witnesses"
  5,84,"And how should we not believe in God and the truth that has come unto us, when we desire that our Lord should cause us to enter among the righteous people?”"
  5,85,"So God rewarded them for what they said with Gardens that have rivers running below, to abide therein, and that is the recompense of the virtuous"
  5,86,As for those who disbelieved and denied Our signs—such shall be the inhabitants of Hellfire
  5,87,"O you who believe! Do not forbid the good things that God has made lawful unto you, and do not transgress. Surely God loves not transgressors"
  5,88,"Eat of that which God has provided you that is lawful and good, and reverence God, in Whom you are believers"
  5,89,"God will not take you to task for that which is frivolous in your oaths, but He will take you to task for the oaths you have pledged in earnest.

Thus does God make clear unto you His signs, that haply you may give thanks"
