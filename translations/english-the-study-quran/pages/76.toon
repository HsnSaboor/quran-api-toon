quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,195,"So their Lord answered them, “I shall not let the work of any worker among you, male or female, be in vain; each of you is like the other. So those who emigrated, and were expelled from their homes, and were hurt in My way, and fought and were slain—I shall absolve them of their evil deeds and shall make them enter Gardens with rivers running below, a reward from God. And God, with Him is the most beautiful reward"
  3,196,Let it not delude thee that those who disbelieve are free to come and go in the land
  3,197,"It is a little enjoyment. Then their refuge is Hell, an evil resting place"
  3,198,"But [as for] those who reverence their Lord, theirs shall be Gardens with rivers running below, abiding therein, as a welcome from God. And that which is with God is better for the pious"
  3,199,"And truly among the People of the Book are those who believe in God and that which has been sent down unto you, and that which has been sent down unto them, humble before God, not selling God’s signs for a paltry price. It is they who shall have their reward with their Lord. Truly God is swift in reckoning"
  3,200,"O you who believe! Be patient, vie in patience, persevere, and reverence God, that haply you may prosper"
