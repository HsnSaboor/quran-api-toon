  13,19,Is one who knows that what has been sent down unto thee from thy Lord is the truth like one who is blind? Only those who possess intellect reflect
  13,20,who fulfill the pact with God and break not the covenant
  13,21,"who join what God has commanded be joined, fear their Lord, and dread an evil reckoning"
  13,22,"and who are patient, seeking the Face of their Lord, perform the prayer, and spend from that which We have provided them, secretly and openly, and who repel evil with good. For them there shall be the reward of the Abode—"
  13,23,"Gardens of Eden that they shall enter along with those who were righteous from among their fathers, their spouses, and their progeny; and angels shall enter upon them from every gate"
  13,24,“Peace be upon you because you were patient.” How excellent is the Ultimate Abode
  13,25,"As for those who break God’s pact after accepting His covenant, and sever what God has commanded be joined, and work corruption upon the earth, it is they who shall have the curse, and theirs shall be the evil abode"

  13,27,"Those who disbelieve say, “Why has some sign not been sent down upon him from his Lord?” Say, “Truly God leads astray whomsoever He will and guides to Himself whosoever turns in repentance—"
  13,28,those who believe and whose hearts are at peace in the remembrance of God. Are not hearts at peace in the remembrance of God
