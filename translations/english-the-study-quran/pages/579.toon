  76,7,They fulfill their vows and fear a day whose evil is widespread
  76,8,"and give food, despite loving it, to the indigent, the orphan, and the captive"
  76,9,“We feed you only for the Face of God. We do not desire any recompense or thanks from you
  76,10,"Truly we fear from our Lord a grim, calamitous day.”"

  76,12,and rewarded them for having been patient with a Garden and with silk
  76,13,"Therein they recline upon couches, seeing neither sun nor bitter cold"
  76,14,"Its shade shall be close above them, and its clusters shall be made to hang low"
  76,15,And vessels of silver and goblets of crystal are brought round for them—
  76,16,silvern crystal that they have measured out with due measure
  76,17,Therein they are given to drink of a cup mixed with ginger
  76,18,a spring therein named Salsabil
  76,19,Immortal youths wait upon them; when you see them you would suppose them to be scattered pearls
  76,20,"And when thou seest, there thou wilt see bliss and a great kingdom"

  76,22,"Truly this is a reward for you, and your endeavoring is held in gratitude"
  76,23,Truly We have sent down the Quran upon thee as a revelation
  76,24,So be patient with thy Lord’s judgment and obey neither sinner nor disbeliever among them
  76,25,And invoke the Name of thy Lord morning and evening
