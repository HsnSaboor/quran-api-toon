quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"Those who believe say, “Would that a surah were sent down.” Then when a definitive surah wherein fighting is mentioned is sent down, thou seest those in whose hearts is a disease looking at thee as if death had overcome them. More fitting for them"
  47,21,"would be obedience to God and honorable speech. Then, when the matter is resolved, were they true to God, it would be better for them"
  47,22,"Were you to turn away, would you perchance work corruption upon the earth and break your family relations"
  47,23,"They are those whom God has cursed, making them deaf and blinding their sight"
  47,24,Do they not contemplate the Quran? Or do hearts have their locks upon them
  47,25,"Truly those who turn their backs after guidance has been made clear to them—Satan has seduced them, yet He grants them respite"
  47,26,"That is because they say to those who are averse to what God has sent down, “We shall obey you in some matters.” And God knows their keeping of secrets"
  47,27,"Then how will it be when the angels seize them, striking their faces and their backs"
  47,28,That is because they followed that which angers God and were averse to His good pleasure; so He made their deeds come to naught
  47,29,Or do those in whose hearts is a disease suppose that God will not expose their rancor
