quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,and what lies within breasts is made known
  100,11,truly on that Day their Lord shall be aware of them
  101,1,The calamity
  101,2,what is the calamity
  101,3,And what shall apprise thee of the calamity
  101,4,A day wherein mankind shall be like scattered moths
  101,5,and the mountains shall be like carded wool
  101,6,As for one whose scales are heavy
  101,7,he shall enjoy a life contenting
  101,8,And as for one whose scales are light
  101,9,an abyss shall be his mother
  101,10,And what shall apprise thee of her
  101,11,It is a raging fire
  102,1,Vying for increase distracts you
  102,2,till you visit the graves
  102,3,Nay! Soon you will know
  102,4,Indeed! Soon you will know
  102,5,Nay! If you knew with the knowledge of certainty
  102,6,you would surely see Hellfire
  102,7,Then you would surely see it with the eye of certainty
  102,8,Then surely you will be questioned that Day about the blessing
