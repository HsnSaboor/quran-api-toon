quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,"Youths which shall continue in their bloom for ever, shall go round about to attend them"
  56,18,"with goblets, and beakers, and a cup of flowing wine"
  56,19,"Their heads shall not ache by drinking the same, neither shall their reason be disturbed"
  56,20,And with fruits of the sorts which they shall choose
  56,21,and the flesh of birds of the kind which they shall desire
  56,22,And there shall accompany them fair damsels having large black eyes
  56,23,resembling pearls hidden in their shells
  56,24,As a reward for that which they shall have wrought
  56,25,"They shall not hear therein any vain discourse, or any charge of sin"
  56,26,"but only the salutation, Peace! Peace"
  56,27,And the companions of the right hand -- how happy shall the companions of the right hand be
  56,28,shall have their abode among lote trees free from thorns
  56,29,and trees of mauz loaded regularly with their produce from top to bottom
  56,30,under an extended shade
  56,31,near a flowing water
  56,32,and amidst fruits in abundance
  56,33,"which shall not fail, nor shall be forbidden to be gathered"
  56,34,And they shall repose themselves on lofty beds
  56,35,Verily We have created the damsels of paradise by a peculiar creation
  56,36,And We have made them virgins
  56,37,"beloved by their husbands, of equal age with them"
  56,38,for the delight of the companions of the right hand
  56,39,There shall be many of the former religions
  56,40,and many of the latter
  56,41,And the companions of the left hand -- how miserable shall the companions of the left hand be
  56,42,"Shall dwell amidst burning winds, and scalding water"
  56,43,under the shade of a black smoke
  56,44,neither cool nor agreeable
  56,45,"For they enjoyed the pleasures of life before this, while on earth"
  56,46,and obstinately persisted in a heinous wickedness
  56,47,"And they said, after we shall have died, and become dust and bones, shall we surely be raised to life"
  56,48,Shall our forefathers also be raised with us
  56,49,"Say, verily both the first and the last"
  56,50,"shall surely be gathered together to judgment, at the prefixed time of a known day"
