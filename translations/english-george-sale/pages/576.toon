quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,For he hath devised and prepared contumelious expressions to ridicule the Koran
  74,19,"May he be cursed: How maliciously hath he prepared the same"
  74,20,"And again, may he be cursed: How maliciously hath he prepared the same"
  74,21,Then he looked
  74,22,"and frowned, and put on an austere countenance"
  74,23,"Then he turned back, and was elated with pride"
  74,24,"and he said, this is no other than a piece of magic, borrowed from others"
  74,25,These are only the words of a man
  74,26,I will cast him to be burned in hell
  74,27,And what shall make thee to understand what hell is
  74,28,"It leaveth not any thing unconsumed, neither doth it suffer any thing to escape"
  74,29,It scorcheth mens flesh
  74,30,Over the same are nineteen angels appointed
  74,31,"We have appointed none but angels to preside over hell fire: And we have expressed the number of them only for an occasion of discord to the unbelievers; that they to whom the scriptures have been given, may be certain of the veracity of this book, and the true believers may increase in faith; and that those to whom the scriptures have been given, and the true believers may not doubt hereafter; and that those in whose hearts there is an infirmity, and the unbelievers may say, what mystery doth God intend by this number? Thus doth God cause to err whom He pleaseth; and He directeth whom He pleaseth. None knoweth the armies of thy Lord, besides Him: And this is no other than a memento unto mankind. Assuredly"
  74,32,By the moon
  74,33,and the night when it retreateth
  74,34,and the morning when it reddeneth
  74,35,I swear that this is one of the most terrible calamities
  74,36,giving warning unto men
  74,37,"as well unto him among you who desireth to go forward, as unto him who chooseth to remain behind"
  74,38,Every soul is given in pledge for that which it shall have wrought
  74,39,Except the companions of the right hand
  74,40,"who shall dwell in gardens, and shall ask one another questions"
  74,41,concerning the wicked
  74,42,"and shall also ask the wicked themselves, saying, what hath brought you into hell"
  74,43,"They shall answer, we were not of those who were constant at prayer"
  74,44,neither did we feed the poor
  74,45,"and we waded in vain disputes, with the fallacious reasoners"
  74,46,and we denied the day of judgment
  74,47,until death overtook us
