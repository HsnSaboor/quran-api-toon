  77,21,which We placed in a sure repository
  77,22,until the fixed term of delivery
  77,23,"And We were able to do this: For We are most powerful"

  77,25,Have We not made the earth to contain
  77,26,the living and the dead
  77,27,"and placed therein stable and lofty mountains, and given you fresh water to drink"
  77,28,"Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture"

  77,30,"Go ye into the shadow of the smoke of hell, which shall ascend in three columns"

  77,37,"Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture"

  77,47,"Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture"
  77,48,"And when it is said unto them, bow down; they do not bow down"
  77,49,"Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture"
