  79,19,"And I will direct thee unto thy Lord, that thou mayest fear to transgress"
  79,20,And he shewed him the very great sign of the rod turned into a serpent
  79,21,"But he charged Moses with imposture, and rebelled against God"
  79,22,Then he turned back hastily
  79,23,"and he assembled the magicians, and cried aloud, saying"
  79,24,I am your supreme Lord
  79,25,"Wherefore God chastised him with the punishment of the life to come, and also of this present life"
  79,26,Verily herein is an example unto him who feareth to rebel
  79,27,"Are ye more difficult to create, or the heaven which God hath built"
