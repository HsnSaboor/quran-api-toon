quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  44,40,Verily the day of separation shall be the appointed term of them all
  44,41,"a day, whereon the master and the servant shall be of no advantage to one another, neither shall they be helped"
  44,42,"excepting those on whom God shall have mercy: For He is the mighty, the merciful"
  44,43,Verily the fruit of the tree of al Zakkum
  44,44,shall be the food of the impious
  44,45,As the dregs of oil shall it boil in the bellies of the damned
  44,46,like the boiling of the hottest water
  44,47,"And it shall be said to the tormentors, take him, and drag him into the midst of hell"
  44,48,And pour on his head the torture of boiling water
  44,49,"saying, taste this; for thou art that mighty and honourable person"
  44,50,Verily this is the punishment of which ye doubted
  44,51,But the pious shall be lodged in a place of security
  44,52,among gardens and fountains
  44,53,"They shall be cloathed in fine silk, and in satin; and they shall sit facing one another"
  44,54,"Thus shall it be: And We will espouse them to fair damsels, having large black eyes"
  44,55,"In that place shall they call for all kinds of fruits, in full security"
  44,56,"They shall not taste death therein, after the first death; and God shall deliver from the pains of hell"
  44,57,Through the gracious bounty of thy Lord. This will be great felicity
  44,58,"Moreover We have rendered the Koran easy for thee, by revealing it in thine own tongue: To the end that they may be admonished"
  44,59,Wherefore do thou wait the event; for they wait to see some misfortune befall thee
