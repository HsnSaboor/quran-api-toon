quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By the afternoon
  103,2,verily man employeth himself in that which will prove of loss
  103,3,"Except those who believe, and do that which is right; and who mutually recommend the truth, and mutually recommend perseverance unto each other"
  104,1,"Woe unto every slanderer, and backbiter"
  104,2,"Who heapeth up riches, and prepareth the same for the time to come"
  104,3,He thinketh that his riches will render him immortal
  104,4,By no means. He shall surely be cast into al Hotama
  104,5,And what shall cause thee to understand what al Hotama is
  104,6,It is the kindled fire of God
  104,7,which shall mount above the hearts of those who shall be cast therein
  104,8,Verily it shall be as an arched vault above them
  104,9,on columns of vast extent
  105,1,Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with the masters of the elephant
  105,2,Did He not make their treacherous design an occasion of drawing them into error
  105,3,and send against them flocks of birds
  105,4,which cast down upon them stones of baked clay
  105,5,and render them like the leaves of corn eaten by cattle
