  26,84,And grant that I may be spoken of with honour among the latest posterity
  26,85,and make me an heir of the garden of delight
  26,86,"And forgive my father, for that he hath been one of those who go astray"
  26,87,And cover me not with shame on the day of resurrection

  26,89,unless unto him who shall come unto God with a sincere heart
  26,90,When paradise shall be brought near to the view of the pious
  26,91,and hell shall appear plainly to those who shall have erred
  26,92,"and it shall be said unto them, where are your deities which ye served"

  26,107,Verily I am a faithful messenger unto you
  26,108,"wherefore fear God, and obey me"
  26,109,I ask no reward of you for my preaching unto you; I expect my reward from no other than the Lord of all creatures
  26,110,"Wherefore fear God, and obey me"
