  82,1,When the heaven shall be cloven in sunder
  82,2,and when the stars shall be scattered
  82,3,and when the seas shall be suffered to join their waters
  82,4,and when the graves shall be turned upside down
  82,5,"Every soul shall know what it hath committed, and what it hath omitted"
  82,6,"O man, what hath seduced thee against thy gracious Lord"
  82,7,"who hath created thee, and put thee together"
  82,8,and rightly disposed thee? In what form He pleased hath He fashioned thee
  82,9,Assuredly. But ye deny the last judgment as a falsehood
  82,10,Verily there are appointed over you guardian angels
  82,11,"honourable in the sight of God, writing down your actions"
  82,12,who know that which ye do
  82,13,The just shall surely be in a place of delight
  82,14,But the wicked shall surely be in hell
  82,15,"they shall be cast therein to be burned, on the day of judgment"
  82,16,and they shall not be absent therefrom for ever
  82,17,What shall cause thee to understand what the day of judgment is
  82,18,"Again, what shall cause thee to understand what the day of judgment is"
  82,19,"It is a day whereon one soul shall not be able to obtain any thing in behalf of another soul: And the command, on that day, shall be God's"
  83,1,Woe be unto those who give short measure or weight
  83,2,"who, when they receive by measure from other men, take the full"
  83,3,"but when they measure unto them, or weigh unto them, defraud"
  83,4,Do not these think they shall be raised again
  83,5,at the great day
  83,6,the day whereon mankind shall stand before the Lord of all creatures
