quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,"they see one another. The wicked shall wish to redeem himself from the punishment of that day, by giving up his children"
  70,12,"and his wife, and his brother"
  70,13,and his kindred who shewed kindness unto him
  70,14,and all who are in the earth; and that this might deliver him
  70,15,"By no means: For hell fire"
  70,16,dragging them by their scalps
  70,17,"shall call him who shall have turned his back, and fled from the faith"
  70,18,"and shall have amassed riches, and covetously hoarded them"
  70,19,Verily man is created extremely impatient
  70,20,"When evil toucheth him, he is full of complaint"
  70,21,"but when good befalleth him, he becometh niggardly"
  70,22,Except those who are devoutly given
  70,23,and who persevere in their prayers
  70,24,and those of whose substance a due and certain portion is ready to be given
  70,25,"unto him who asketh, and him who is forbidden by shame to ask"
  70,26,And those who sincerely believe the day of judgment
  70,27,and who dread the punishment of their Lord
  70,28,For there is none secure from the punishment of their Lord
  70,29,And who abstain from the carnal knowledge
  70,30,"of women other than their wives, or the slaves which their right hands possess; -- for as to them they shall be blameless"
  70,31,"but whoever coveteth any woman besides these, they are transgressors"
  70,32,"And those who faithfully keep what they are intrusted with, and their covenant"
  70,33,and who are upright in their testimonies
  70,34,and who carefully observe the requisite rites in their prayers
  70,35,"These shall dwell amidst gardens, highly honoured"
  70,36,"What aileth the unbelievers, that they run before thee"
  70,37,"in companies, on the right hand and on the left"
  70,38,Doth every man of them wish to enter into a garden of delight
  70,39,"By no means: Verily We have created them of that which they know"
