quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,By no means. Verily the register of the actions of the wicked is surely in Sejjin
  83,8,And what shall make thee to understand what Sejjin is
  83,9,It is a book distinctly written
  83,10,"Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture"
  83,11,who denied the day of judgment as a falsehood
  83,12,"And none denieth the same as falsehood, except every unjust and flagitious person"
  83,13,"Who, when our signs are rehearsed unto him, saith, they are fables of the ancients"
  83,14,"By no means: But rather their lusts have cast a veil over their hearts"
  83,15,By no means. Verily they shall be shut out from their Lord on that day
  83,16,and they shall be sent into hell to be burned
  83,17,"Then shall it be said unto them, by the infernal guards, this is what ye denied as a falsehood"
  83,18,Assuredly. But the register of the actions of the righteous is in Illiyyun
  83,19,And what shall cause thee to understand what Illiyyun is
  83,20,It is a book distinctly written
  83,21,"Those who approach near unto God, are witnesses thereto"
  83,22,Verily the righteous shall dwell among delights
  83,23,Seated on couches they shall behold objects of pleasure
  83,24,thou shalt see in their faces the brightness of joy
  83,25,"They shall be given to drink of pure wine, sealed"
  83,26,"the seal whereof shall be musk: And to this let those aspire, who aspire to happiness"
  83,27,And the water mixed therewith shall be of Tasnim
  83,28,a fountain whereof those shall drink who approach near unto the divine presence

  83,30,"and when they pass by them, they wink at one another"
  83,31,"And when they turn aside to their people, they turn aside making scurrilous jests"
  83,32,"And when they see them, they say, verily these are mistaken men"
  83,33,But they are not sent to be keepers over them
  83,34,"Wherefore one day the true believers, in their turn, shall laugh the infidels to scorn"
