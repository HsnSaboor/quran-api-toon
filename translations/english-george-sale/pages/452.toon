quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,Ye have no reason to judge thus
  37,155,Will ye not therefore be admonished
  37,156,Or have ye a manifest proof of what ye say
  37,157,"Produce now your book of revelations, if ye speak truth"
  37,158,"And they make Him to be of kin unto the genii; whereas the genii know that they who affirm such things, shall be delivered up to eternal punishment"
  37,159,"far be that from God, which they affirm of him"
  37,160,Except the sincere servants of God
  37,161,Moreover ye and that which ye worship
  37,162,shall not seduce any concerning God
  37,163,except him who is destined to be burned in hell
  37,164,"There is none of us, but hath an appointed place"
  37,165,"We range ourselves in order, attending the commands of God"
  37,166,and we celebrate the divine praise
  37,167,The infidels said
  37,168,"if we had been favoured with a book of divine revelations, of those which were delivered to the ancients"
  37,169,we had surely been sincere servants of God
  37,170,"Yet now the Koran is revealed, they believe not therein; but hereafter shall they know the consequence of their unbelief"
  37,171,Our word hath formerly been given unto our servants the apostles
  37,172,that they should certainly be assisted against the infidels
  37,173,and that our armies should surely be the conquerors
  37,174,"Turn aside therefore from them, for a season"
  37,175,And see the calamities which shall afflict them; for they shall see thy future success and prosperity
  37,176,Do they therefore seek to hasten our vengeance
  37,177,"Verily when it shall descend into their courts, an evil morning shall it be unto those who were warned in vain"
  37,178,Turn aside from them therefore for a season
  37,179,"and see: Hereafter shall they see thy success and their punishment"
  37,180,"Praise be unto thy Lord, the Lord who is far exalted above what they affirm of Him"
  37,181,And peace be on his apostles
  37,182,"And praise be unto God, the Lord of all creatures"
