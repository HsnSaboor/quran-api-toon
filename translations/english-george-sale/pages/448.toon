quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"who said unto me, art thou one of those who assertest the truth of the resurrection"
  37,53,"After we shall be dead, and reduced to dust and bones, shall we surely be judged"
  37,54,"Then he shall say to his companions, will ye look down"
  37,55,"And he shall look down, and shall see him in the midst of hell"
  37,56,"And he shall say unto him, by God, it wanted little but thou hadst drawn me into ruin"
  37,57,"and had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I had surely been one of those who have been delivered up to eternal torment"

  37,72,And We sent warners unto them heretofore
  37,73,And see how miserable was the end of those who were warned
  37,74,except the sincere servants of God
  37,75,"Noah called on Us in former days, and We heard him graciously"
  37,76,And We delivered him and his family out of the great distress
