quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  51,52,"In like manner there came no apostle unto their predecessors, but they said, this man is a magician, or a madman"
  51,53,Have they bequeathed this behaviour successively the one to the other? Yea; they are a people who enormously transgress
  51,54,Wherefore withdraw from them; and thou shalt not be blameworthy in so doing
  51,55,"Yet continue to admonish: For admonition profiteth the true believers"
  51,56,I have not created genii and men for any other end than that they should serve Me
  51,57,I require not any sustenance from them; neither will I that they feed Me
  51,58,Verily God is He who provideth for all creatures; possessed of mighty power
  51,59,Unto those who shall injure our apostle shall be given a portion like unto the portion of those who behaved like them in times past; and they shall not wish the same to be hastened
  51,60,"Woe, therefore, to the unbelievers, because of their day with which they are threatened"
  52,1,By the mountain of Sinai
  52,2,and by the book written
  52,3,in an expanded scroll
  52,4,and by the visited house
  52,5,and by the elevated roof of heaven
  52,6,and by the swelling ocean
  52,7,Verily the punishment of thy Lord will surely descend
  52,8,there shall be none to withhold it
  52,9,"On that day the heaven shall be shaken, and shall reel"
  52,10,and the mountains shall walk and pass away
  52,11,And on that day woe be unto those who accused God's apostles of imposture
  52,12,who amused themselves in wading in vain disputes
  52,13,On that day shall they be driven and thrust into the fire of hell
  52,14,"and it shall be said unto them, this is the fire which ye denied as a fiction"
