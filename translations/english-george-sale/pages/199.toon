quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,73,"O prophet, wage war against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be severe unto them: For their dwelling shall be hell; an unhappy journey shall it be thither"
  9,74,"They swear by God that they said not what they are charged with: Yet they spake the word of infidelity, and became unbelievers, after they had embraced Islam. And they designed that which they could not effect; and they did not disapprove the design for any other reason, than because God and his apostle had inriched them, of his bounty. If they repent, it will be better for them; but if they relapse, God will punish them with a grievous torment, in this world and in the next; and they shall have no patron on earth, nor any protector"
  9,75,"There are some of them who made a covenant with God, saying, verily if He give us of his abundance, we will give alms, and become righteous people"
  9,76,"Yet when He had given unto them of his abundance, they became covetous thereof, and turned back, and retired afar off"
  9,77,"Wherefore He hath caused hypocrisy to succeed in their hearts, until the day whereon they shall meet Him; for that they failed to perform unto God that which they had promised Him, and for that they prevaricated"
  9,78,"Do they not know that God knoweth whatever they conceal, and their private discourses; and that God is the knower of secrets"
  9,79,"They who traduce such of the believers as are liberal in giving alms beyond what they are obliged, and those who find nothing to give, but what they gain by their industry; and therefore scoff at them: God shall scoff at them, and they shall suffer a grievous punishment"
