quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,171,"O ye who have received the scriptures, exceed not the just bounds in your religion, neither say of God any other than the truth. Verily Christ Jesus the son of Mary is the apostle of God, and his word, which he conveyed into Mary, and a spirit proceeding from him. Believe therefore in God, and his apostles, and say not, there are three Gods; forbear this; it will be better for you. God is but one God. Far be it from Him that He should have a son! Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth; and God is a sufficient protector"
  4,172,"Christ doth not proudly disdain to be a servant unto God; neither the angles who approach near to his presence: And whoso disdaineth his service, and is puffed up with pride, God will gather them all to Himself, on the last day"
  4,173,"Unto those who believe, and do that which is right, He shall give their rewards, and shall superabundantly add unto them of his liberality: But those who are disdainful and proud, He will punish with a grievous punishment; and they shall not find any to protect or to help them, besides God"
  4,174,"O men, now is an evident proof come unto you from your Lord, and We have sent down unto you manifest light"
  4,175,"They who believe in God and firmly adhere to him, He will lead them into mercy from him, and abundance; and He will direct them in the right way to himself"
