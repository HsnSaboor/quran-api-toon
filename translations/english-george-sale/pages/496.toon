quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  44,1,M
  44,2,By the perspicuous book of the Koran
  44,3,"verily We have sent down the same on a blessed night, -- for We had engaged so to do"
  44,4,"on the night wherein is distinctly sent down the decree of every determined thing, as a command from Us"
  44,5,"Verily We have ever used to send apostles with revelations, at proper intervals"
  44,6,as a mercy from thy Lord; for it is He who heareth and knoweth
  44,7,"The Lord of heaven and earth, and of whatever is between them; if ye are men of sure knowledge"
  44,8,"There is no God but He: He giveth life, and He causeth to die; he is your Lord, and the Lord of your fore-fathers"
  44,9,Yet do they amuse themselves with doubt
  44,10,But observe them on the day whereon the heaven shall produce a visible smoke
  44,11,"which shall cover mankind: This will be a tormenting plague"
  44,12,"They shall say, O Lord, take this plague from off us: Verily we will become true believers"
  44,13,How should an admonition be of avail to them in this condition; when a manifest apostle came unto them
  44,14,"but they retired from him, saying, this man is instructed by others, or is a distracted person"
  44,15,"We will take the plague from off you, a little: But ye will certainly return to your infidelity"
  44,16,"On the day whereon We shall fiercely assault them with great power, verily We will take vengeance on them"
  44,17,"We made trial of the people of Pharaoh before them, and an honourable messenger came unto them, saying"
  44,18,send unto me the servants of God; verily I am a faithful messenger unto you
