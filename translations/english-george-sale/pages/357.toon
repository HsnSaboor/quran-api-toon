  24,54,"Say, obey God, and obey the apostle: But if ye turn back, verily it is expected of him that he perform his duty, and of you that ye perform your duty; and if ye obey him, ye shall be directed: But the duty of our apostle is only public preaching"
  24,55,"God promiseth unto such of you as believe, and do good works, that he will cause them to succeed the unbelievers in the earth, as he caused those who were before you to succeed the infidels of their time; and that he will establish for them their religion which pleaseth them, and will change their fear into security.

  24,56,"Observe prayer, and give alms, and obey the apostle; that ye may obtain mercy"
  24,57,"Think not that the unbelievers shall frustrate the designs of God on earth: And their abode hereafter shall be hell fire; a miserable journey shall it be thither"

Thus God declareth his signs unto you; for God is knowing and wise"
