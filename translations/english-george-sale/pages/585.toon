quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,"The prophet frowned, and turned aside"
  80,2,because the blind man came unto him
  80,3,And how dost thou know whether he shall peradventure be cleansed from his sins
  80,4,"or whether he shall be admonished, and the admonition shall profit him"
  80,5,The man who is wealthy
  80,6,thou receivest respectfully
  80,7,"whereas it is not to be charged on thee, that he is not cleansed"
  80,8,But him who cometh unto thee earnestly seeking his salvation
  80,9,and who feareth God
  80,10,dost thou neglect
  80,11,By no means shouldest thou act thus
  80,12,Verily the Koran is an admonition; -- and he who is willing retaineth the same
  80,13,written in volumes honourable
  80,14,"exalted, and pure"
  80,15,by the hands of scribes honoured
  80,16,and just
  80,17,May man be cursed! What hath seduced him to infidelity
  80,18,Of what thing doth God create him
  80,19,Of a drop of seed doth He create him; and He formeth him with proportion
  80,20,and then facilitateth his passage out of the womb
  80,21,"Afterwards He causeth him to die, and layeth him in the grave"
  80,22,"hereafter, when it shall please Him, He shall raise him to life"
  80,23,Assuredly. He hath not hitherto fully performed what God hath commanded him
  80,24,Let man consider his food; in what manner it is provided
  80,25,We pour down water by showers
  80,26,afterwards We cleave the earth in clefts
  80,27,and We cause corn to spring forth therein
  80,28,"and grapes, and clover"
  80,29,"and the olive, and the palm"
  80,30,and gardens planted thick with trees
  80,31,"and fruits, and grass"
  80,32,for the use of yourselves and of your cattle
  80,33,When the stunning sound of the trumpet shall be heard
  80,34,on that day shall a man fly from his brother
  80,35,"and his mother, and his father"
  80,36,"and his wife, and his children"
  80,37,"Every man of them, on that day, shall have business of his own sufficient to employ his thoughts"
  80,38,On that day the faces of some shall be bright
  80,39,"laughing, and joyful"
  80,40,"And upon the faces of others, on that day, shall there be dust"
  80,41,darkness shall cover them
  80,42,"These are the unbelievers, the wicked"
