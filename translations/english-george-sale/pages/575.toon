quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Thy Lord knoweth that thou continuest in prayer and meditation sometimes near two third parts of the night, and sometimes one half thereof, and at other times one third part thereof: And a part of thy companions, who are with thee, do the same. But God measureth the night and the day; he knoweth that ye cannot exactly compute the same: Wherefore He turneth favourably unto you. Read, therefore, so much of the Koran as may be easy unto you. He knoweth that there will be some infirm among you; and others travel through the earth, that they may obtain a competency of the bounty of God; and others fight in the defence of God's faith. Read, therefore, so much of the same as may be easy. And observe the stated times of prayer, and pay the legal alms; and lend unto God an acceptable loan; for whatever good ye send before for your souls, ye shall find the same with God. This will be better, and will merit a greater reward. And ask God forgiveness; for God is ready to forgive, and merciful"
  74,1,O thou covered
  74,2,arise and preach
  74,3,and magnify thy Lord
  74,4,And cleanse thy garments
  74,5,And fly every abomination
  74,6,"And be not liberal, in hopes to receive more in return"
  74,7,And patiently wait for thy Lord
  74,8,When the trumpet shall sound
  74,9,verily that day shall be a day of distress
  74,10,and uneasiness unto the unbelievers
  74,11,Let me alone with him whom I have created
  74,12,on whom I have bestowed abundant riches
  74,13,and children dwelling in his presence
  74,14,and for whom I have disposed affairs in a smooth and easy manner
  74,15,and who desireth that I will yet add other blessings unto him
  74,16,"By no means: Because he is an adversary to our signs"
  74,17,I will afflict him with grievous calamities
