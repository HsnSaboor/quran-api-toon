quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Hast thou seen him who believeth not in our signs, and saith, I shall surely have riches and children bestowed on me"
  19,78,Is he acquainted with the secrets of futurity; or hath he received a covenant from the Merciful that it shall be so
  19,79,By no means. We will surely write down that which he saith; and increasing We will increase his punishment
  19,80,"And We will be his heir as to that which he speaketh of, and on the last day he shall appear before Us alone and naked"
  19,81,"They have taken other gods, besides God, that they may be a glory unto them"
  19,82,By no means. Hereafter shall they deny their worship; and they shall become adversaries unto them
  19,83,"Dost thou not see that we send the devils against the infidels, to incite them to sin by their instigations"
  19,84,Wherefore be not in hast to call down destruction upon them; for we number unto them a determined number of days of respite
  19,85,"On a certain day we will assemble the pious before the Merciful in an honourable manner, as ambassadors come into the presence of a prince"
  19,86,"but we will drive the wicked into hell, as cattle are driven to water"
  19,87,"They shall obtain no intercession, except he only who hath received a covenant from the Merciful"
  19,88,"They say, the Merciful hath begotten issue"
  19,89,Now have ye uttered an impious thing
  19,90,"It wanteth little but that on occasion thereof the heavens be rent, and the earth cleave in sunder, and the mountains be overthrown and fall"
  19,91,for that they attribute children unto the Merciful
  19,92,whereas it becometh not God to beget children
  19,93,"Verily there is none in heaven or on earth, but shall approach the Merciful as his servant"
  19,94,"He encompasseth them by his knowledge and power, and numbereth them with an exact computation"
  19,95,"And they shall all come unto him on the day of resurrection, destitute both of helpers and followers"
