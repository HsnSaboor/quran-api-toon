quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  33,1,"O prophet, fear God, and obey not the unbelievers and the hypocrites: Verily God is knowing and wise"
  33,2,But follow that which is revealed unto thee from thy Lord; for God is well-acquainted with that which ye do
  33,3,And put thy trust in God; for God is a sufficient protector
  33,4,"God hath not given a man two hearts within him; neither hath he made your wives -- some of whom ye divorce, regarding them thereafters as your mothers -- your true mothers; nor hath he made your adopted sons your true sons. This is your saying in your mouths: But God speaketh the truth ; and he directeth the right way"
  33,5,"Call such as are adopted, the sons of their natural fathers: This will be more just in the sight of God. And if ye know not their fathers, let them be as your brethren in religion, and your companions: And it shall be no crime in you, that ye err in this matter; but that shall be criminal which your hearts purposely design; for God is gracious and merciful"
  33,6,"The prophet is nigher unto the true believers than their own souls; and his wives are their mothers. Those who are related by consanguinity are nigher of kin the one of them unto the others, according to the book of God, than the other true believers, and the Mohajerun: Unless that ye do what is fitting and reasonable to your relations in general. This is written in the book of God"
