quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,Now are the true believers happy
  23,2,Who humble themselves in their prayer
  23,3,and who eschew all vain discourse
  23,4,and who are doers of alms-deeds
  23,5,and who keep themselves from carnal knowledge of any women
  23,6,"except their wives, or the captives which their right hands possess; -- for as to them they shall be blameless"
  23,7,"But whoever coveteth any woman beyond these, they are transgressors"
  23,8,"And who acquit themselves faithfully of their trust, and justly perform their covenant"
  23,9,and who observe their appointed times of prayer
  23,10,These shall be the heirs
  23,11,who shall inherit paradise; they shall continue therein for ever
  23,12,We formerly created man of a finer sort of clay
  23,13,afterwards We placed him in the form of seed in a sure receptacle
  23,14,"Afterwards We made the seed coagulated blood; and We formed the coagulated blood into a piece of flesh: Then We formed the piece of flesh into bones; and We cloathed those bones with flesh: Then We produced the same by another creation. Wherefore blessed be God, the most excellent creator"
  23,15,After this shall ye die
  23,16,"And afterwards shall ye be restored to life, on the day of resurrection"
  23,17,"And We have created over you seven heavens: And We are not negligent of what We have created"
