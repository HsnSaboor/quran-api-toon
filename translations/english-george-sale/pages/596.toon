quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,which none shall enter to be burned except the most wretched
  92,16,"who shall have disbelieved, and turned back"
  92,17,"But he who strictly bewareth idolatry and rebellion, shall be removed far from the same"
  92,18,who giveth his substance in alms
  92,19,"and by whom no benefit is bestowed on any, that it may be recompensed"
  92,20,"but who bestoweth the same for the sake of his Lord, the most High"
  92,21,And hereafter he shall be well satisfied with his reward
  93,1,By the brightness of the morning
  93,2,"and by the night, when it groweth dark"
  93,3,"Thy Lord hath not forsaken thee, neither doth He hate thee"
  93,4,Verily the life to come shall be better for thee than this present life
  93,5,And thy Lord shall give thee a reward wherewith thou shalt be well pleased
  93,6,"Did He not find thee an orphan, and hath He not taken care of thee"
  93,7,"And did He not find thee wandering in error, and hath He not guided thee into the truth"
  93,8,"And did He not find thee needy, and hath He not enriched thee"
  93,9,Wherefore oppress not the orphan
  93,10,neither repulse the beggar
  93,11,But declare the goodness of thy Lord
  94,1,Have We not opened thy breast
  94,2,and eased thee of thy burden
  94,3,which galled thy back
  94,4,and raised thy reputation for thee
  94,5,Verily a difficulty shall be attended with ease
  94,6,Verily a difficulty shall be attended with ease
  94,7,"When thou shalt have ended thy preaching, labour to serve God in return for his favours"
  94,8,and make thy supplication unto thy Lord
