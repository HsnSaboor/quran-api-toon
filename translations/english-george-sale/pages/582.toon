quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,Concerning what do the unbelievers ask questions of one another
  78,2,Concerning the great news of the resurrection
  78,3,about which they disagree
  78,4,Assuredly they shall hereafter know the truth thereof
  78,5,"Again, assuredly they shall hereafter know the truth thereof"
  78,6,Have We not made the earth for a bed
  78,7,and the mountains for stakes to fix the same
  78,8,And have We not created you of two sexes
  78,9,and appointed your sleep for rest
  78,10,and made the night a garment to cover you
  78,11,and destined the day to the gaining your livelihood
  78,12,and built over you seven solid heavens
  78,13,and placed therein a burning lamp
  78,14,"And do We not send down from the clouds pressing forth rain, water pouring down in abundance"
  78,15,"that We may thereby produce corn, and herbs"
  78,16,and gardens planted thick with trees
  78,17,Verily the day of separation is a fixed period
  78,18,"The day whereon the trumpet shall sound, and ye shall come in troops to judgment"
  78,19,"and the heaven shall be opened, and shall be full of gates for the angels to pass through"
  78,20,"and the mountains shall pass away, and become as a vapour"
  78,21,verily hell shall be a place of ambush
  78,22,a receptacle for the transgressors
  78,23,who shall remain therein for ages
  78,24,"They shall not taste any refreshment therein, or any drink"
  78,25,"except boiling water, and filthy corruption"
  78,26,A fit recompense for their deeds
  78,27,For they hoped that they should not be brought to an account
  78,28,"and they disbelieved our signs, accusing them of falsehood"
  78,29,"But every thing have We computed, and written down"
  78,30,"Taste, therefore: We will not add unto you any other than torment"
