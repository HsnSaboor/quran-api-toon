quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,"By the fig, and the olive"
  95,2,and by mount Sinai
  95,3,and this territory of security
  95,4,Verily We created man of a most excellent fabric
  95,5,afterwards We rendered him the vilest of the vile
  95,6,"Except those who believe, and work righteousness; for they shall receive an endless reward"
  95,7,What therefore shall cause thee to deny the day of judgment after this
  95,8,Is not God the most wise judge
  96,1,"Read, in the name of thy Lord, Who hath created all things"
  96,2,who hath created man of congealed blood
  96,3,"Read, by thy most beneficent Lord"
  96,4,Who taught the use of the pen
  96,5,Who teacheth man that which he knoweth not
  96,6,Assuredly. Verily man becometh insolent
  96,7,because he seeth himself abound in riches
  96,8,Verily unto thy Lord shall be the return of all
  96,9,What thinkest thou as to him
  96,10,"who forbiddeth our servant, when he prayeth"
  96,11,What thinkest thou; if he follow the right direction
  96,12,or command piety
  96,13,"What thinkest thou; if he accuse the divine revelations of falsehood, and turn his back"
  96,14,Doth he not know that God seeth
  96,15,"Assuredly. Verily, if he forbear not, We will drag him by the forelock"
  96,16,"the lying, sinful forelock"
  96,17,And let him call his council to his assistance
  96,18,We also will call the infernal guards to cast him into hell
  96,19,"Assuredly. Obey him not: But continue to adore God; and draw nigh unto Him"
