quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"God will render of none effect the works of those who believe not, and who turn away men from the way of God"
  47,2,"But as to those who believe, and work righteousness, and believe in the revelation which hath been sent down unto Mohammed, -- for it is the truth from their Lord, -- He will expiate their evil deeds from them, and will dispose their heart aright"
  47,3,"This will He do, because those who believe not follow vanity, and because those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus God propoundeth unto men their examples"
  47,4,"When ye encounter the unbelievers, strike off their heads, until ye have made a great slaughter among them; and bind them in bonds: And either give them a free dismission afterwards, or exact a ransom; until the war shall have laid down its arms. This shall ye do: Verily if God pleased, He could take vengeance on them, without your assistance; but He commandeth you to fight his battles, that He may prove the one of you by the other. And as to those who fight in defence of God's true religion, God will not suffer their works to perish"
  47,5,"He will guide them, and will dispose their heart aright"
  47,6,"and He will lead them into paradise, of which He hath told them"
  47,7,"O true believers, if ye assist God, by fighting for his religion, He will assist you against your enemies; and will set your feet fast"
  47,8,"But as for the infidels, let them perish; and their works shall God render vain"
  47,9,"This shall befall them, because they have rejected with abhorrence that which God hath revealed: Wherefore their works shall become of no avail"
  47,10,"Do they not travel through the earth, and see what hath been the end of those who were before them? God utterly destroyed them: And the like catastrophe awaiteth the unbelievers"
  47,11,"This shall come to pass, for that God is the patron of the true believers, and for that the infidels have no protector"
