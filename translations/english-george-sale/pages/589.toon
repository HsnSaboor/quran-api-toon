quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,Lying on couches they shall look down upon them in hell
  83,36,Shall not the infidels be rewarded for that which they have done
  84,1,When the heaven shall be rent in sunder
  84,2,"and shall obey its Lord, and shall be capable thereof"
  84,3,and when the earth shall be stretched out
  84,4,"and shall cast forth that which is therein, and shall remain empty"
  84,5,"and shall obey its Lord, and shall be capable thereof"
  84,6,"O man, verily labouring thou labourest to meet thy Lord, and thou shalt meet Him"
  84,7,And he who shall have his book given into his right hand
  84,8,shall be called to an easy account
  84,9,and shall turn unto his family with joy
  84,10,But he who shall have his book given him behind his back
  84,11,shall invoke destruction to fall upon him
  84,12,and he shall be sent into hell to be burned
  84,13,because he rejoiced insolently amidst his family on earth
  84,14,Verily he thought that he should never return unto God
  84,15,Yea verily; but his Lord beheld him
  84,16,Wherefore I swear by the redness of the sky after sun-set
  84,17,"and by the night, and the animals which it driveth together"
  84,18,and by the moon when she is at the full
  84,19,ye shall surely be transferred successively from state to state
  84,20,"What aileth them, therefore, that they believe not the resurrection"
  84,21,"and that, when the Koran is read unto them, they worship not"
  84,22,"Yea: The unbelievers accuse the same of imposture"
  84,23,But God well knoweth the malice which they keep hidden in their breasts
  84,24,Wherefore denounce unto them a grievous punishment
  84,25,"except those who believe and do good works: For them is prepared a never failing reward"
