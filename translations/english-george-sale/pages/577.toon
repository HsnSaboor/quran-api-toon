quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,And the intercession of the interceders shall not avail them
  74,49,"What aileth them, therefore, that they turn aside from the admonition of the Koran"
  74,50,as though they were timorous asses
  74,51,flying from a lion
  74,52,But every man among them desireth that he may have expanded scrolls delivered to him from God
  74,53,By no means. They fear not the life to come
  74,54,"By no means: Verily this is a sufficient warning"
  74,55,"Whoso is willing to be warned, him shall it warn"
  74,56,"But they shall not be warned, unless God shall please. He is worthy to be feared; and he is inclined to forgiveness"
  75,1,Verily I swear by the day of resurrection
  75,2,and I swear by the soul which accuseth itself
  75,3,Doth man think that We will not gather his bones together
  75,4,"Yea: We are able to put together the smallest bones of his fingers"
  75,5,"But man chooseth to be wicked, for the time which is before him"
  75,6,"He asketh, when will the day of resurrection be"
  75,7,But when the sight shall be dazzled
  75,8,and the moon shall be eclipsed
  75,9,and the sun and the moon shall be in conjunction
  75,10,"on that day man shall say, where is a place of refuge"
  75,11,"By no means: There shall be no place to fly unto"
  75,12,With thy Lord shall be the sure mansion of rest on that day
  75,13,On that day shall a man be told that which he hath done first and last
  75,14,Yea; a man shall be an evidence against himself
  75,15,"And though he offer his excuses, they shall not be received"
  75,16,"Move not thy tongue, O Mohammed, in repeating the revelations brought thee by Gabriel, before he shall have finished the same, that thou mayest quickly commit them to memory"
  75,17,"For the collecting the Koran in thy mind, and the teaching thee the true reading thereof are incumbent on Us"
  75,18,"But when We shall have read the same unto thee by the tongue of the angel, do thou follow the reading thereof"
  75,19,And afterwards it shall be our part to explain it unto thee
