quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,58,"nor those who, when ye call to prayer, make a laughing-stock and a jest of it, this they do, because they are people who do not understand"
  5,59,"Say, O ye who have received the scriptures, do ye reject us for any other reason than because we believe in God, and that revelation which hath been sent down unto us, and that which was formerly sent down, and for that the greater part of you are transgressors"
  5,60,"Say, shall I denounce unto you a worse thing than this, as to the reward which ye are to expect with God? He whom God hath cursed, and with whom he hath been angry, having changed some of them into apes and swine, and who worship Taghut, they are in the worse condition, and err more widely from the straitness of the path"
  5,61,"When they came unto you, they said, we believe: Yet they entered into your company with infidelity, and went forth from you with the same; but God well knew what they concealed"
  5,62,"Thou shalt see many of them hastening unto iniquity and malice, and to eat things forbidden; and woe unto them for what they have done"
  5,63,"Unless their doctors and priests forbid them uttering wickedness, and eating things forbidden; woe unto them for what they shall have committed"
  5,64,"The Jews say, the hand of God is tied up. Their hands shall be tied up, and they shall be cursed for that which they have said. Nay, his hands are both stretched forth; He bestoweth as He pleaseth: That which hath been sent down unto thee from thy Lord shall increase the transgression and infidelity of many of them; and we have put enmity and hatred between them, until the day of resurrection. So often as they shall kindle a fire for war, God shall extinguish it; and they shall set their minds to act corruptly in the earth, but God loveth not the corrupt doers"
