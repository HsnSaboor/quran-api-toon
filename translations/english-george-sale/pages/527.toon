quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,Verily they who believe not in the life to come give unto the angels a female appellation
  53,28,"But they have no knowledge herein: They follow no other than a bare opinion; and a bare opinion attaineth not any thing of truth"
  53,29,"Wherefore withdraw from him who turneth away from our admonition, and seeketh only the present life"
  53,30,This is their highest pitch of knowledge. Verily thy Lord well knoweth him who erreth from his way; and He well knoweth him who is rightly directed
  53,31,"Unto God belongeth whatever is in heaven and earth: That He may reward those who do evil, according to that which they shall have wrought; and may reward those who do well, with the most excellent reward"
  53,32,"As to those who avoid great crimes, and hainous sins, and are guilty only of lighter faults; verily thy Lord will be extensive in mercy towards them. He well knew you when He produced you out of the earth, and when ye were embryo's in your mothers' wombs: Wherefore justify not your selves: He best knoweth the man who feareth Him"
  53,33,What thinkest thou of him who turneth aside from following the truth
  53,34,"and giveth little, and covetously stoppeth his hand"
  53,35,"Is the knowledge of futurity with him, so that he seeth the same"
  53,36,hath he not been informed of that which is contained in the books of Moses
  53,37,and of Abraham who faithfully performed his engagements
  53,38,"To wit: That a burdened soul shall not bear the burden of another"
  53,39,"and that nothing shall be imputed to a man for righteousness, except his own labour"
  53,40,and that his labour shall surely be made manifest hereafter
  53,41,and that he shall be rewarded for the same with a most abundant reward
  53,42,and that unto thy Lord will be the end of all things
  53,43,"and that He causeth to laugh, and causeth to weep"
  53,44,"and that He putteth to death, and giveth life"
