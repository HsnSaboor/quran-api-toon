quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,6,"O true believers, when ye prepare your selves to pray, wash your faces, and your hands unto the elbows; and rub your heads, and your feet unto the ancles; and if ye be polluted by having lain with a woman, wash your selves all over. But if ye be sick, or on a journey, or any of you cometh from the privy, or if ye have touched women, and ye find no water, take fine clean sand, and rub your faces and your hands therewith; God would not put a difficulty upon you; but he desireth to purify you, and to complete his favour upon you, that ye may give thanks"
  5,7,"Remember the favour of God towards you, and his covenant which he hath made with you, when ye said, we have heard, and will obey. Therefore fear God, for God knoweth the innermost parts of the breasts of men"
  5,8,"O true believers, observe justice when ye appear as witnesses before God, and let not hatred towards any induce you to do wrong: But act justly; this will approach nearer unto piety; and fear God, for God is fully acquainted with what ye do"
  5,9,"God hath promised unto those who believe, and do that which is right, that they shall receive pardon and a great reward"
