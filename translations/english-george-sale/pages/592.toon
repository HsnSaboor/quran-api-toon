quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,But ye prefer this present life
  87,17,"Yet the life to come is better, and more durable"
  87,18,Verily this is written in the ancient books
  87,19,the books of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Hath the news of the overwhelming day of judgment reached thee
  88,2,"The countenances of some, on that day, shall be cast down"
  88,3,labouring and toiling
  88,4,They shall be cast into scorching fire to be broiled
  88,5,They shall be given to drink of a boiling fountain
  88,6,"They shall have no food, but of dry thorns and thistles"
  88,7,"which shall not fatten, neither shall they satisfy hunger"
  88,8,"But the countenances of others, on that day, shall be joyful"
  88,9,well pleased with their past endeavour
  88,10,They shall be placed in a lofty garden
  88,11,wherein thou shalt hear no vain discourse
  88,12,Therein shall be a running fountain
  88,13,Therein shall be raised beds
  88,14,and goblets placed before them
  88,15,and cushions laid in order
  88,16,and carpets ready spread
  88,17,"Do they not consider the camels, how they are created"
  88,18,"and the heaven, how it is raised"
  88,19,"and the mountains, how they are fixed"
  88,20,"and the earth, how it is extended"
  88,21,Wherefore warn thy people; for thou art a warner only
  88,22,Thou art not impowered to act with authority over them
  88,23,"But whoever shall turn back, and disbelieve"
  88,24,God shall punish him with the greater punishment of the life to come
  88,25,Verily unto us shall they return
  88,26,Then shall it be our part to bring them to account
