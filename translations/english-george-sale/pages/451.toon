quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"But they accused him of imposture: Wherefore they shall be delivered up to eternal punishment"
  37,128,except the sincere servants of God
  37,129,And We left the following salutation to be bestowed on him by the latest posterity
  37,130,"namely, peace be on Ilyasin"
  37,131,Thus do We reward the righteous
  37,132,For he was one of our faithful servants
  37,133,And Lot was also one of those who were sent by Us
  37,134,When We delivered him and his whole family
  37,135,"except an old woman, his wife, who perished among those that remained behind"
  37,136,Afterwards We destroyed the others
  37,137,"And ye, O people of Mecca, pass by the places where they once dwelt, as ye journey in the morning"

  37,147,"and We sent him to an hundred thousand persons, or they were a greater number"
  37,148,"and they believed: Wherefore We granted them to enjoy this life, for a season"
  37,149,"Inquire of the Meccans whether thy Lord hath daughters, and they sons"
  37,150,Have We created the angels of the female sex? And were they witnesses thereof
  37,151,Do they not say of their own false invention
  37,152,God hath begotten issue? And are they not really liars
  37,153,Hath he chosen daughters preferably to sons
