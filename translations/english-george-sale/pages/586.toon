quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun shall be folded up
  81,2,and when the stars shall fall
  81,3,and when the mountains shall be made to pass away
  81,4,and when the camels ten months gone with young shall be neglected
  81,5,and when the wild beasts shall be gathered together
  81,6,and when the seas shall boil
  81,7,and when the souls shall be joined again to their bodies
  81,8,and when the girl who hath been buried alive shall be asked
  81,9,for what crime she was put to death
  81,10,and when the books shall be laid open
  81,11,and when the heaven shall be removed
  81,12,and when hell shall burn fiercely
  81,13,and when paradise shall be brought near
  81,14,Every soul shall know what it hath wrought
  81,15,Verily I swear by the stars which are retrograde
  81,16,"which move swiftly, and which hide themselves"
  81,17,"and by the night, when it cometh on"
  81,18,"and by the morning, when it appeareth"
  81,19,that these are the words of an honourable messenger
  81,20,"endued with strengeth, of established dignity in the sight of the possessor of the throne"
  81,21,"obeyed by the angels under his authority, and faithful"
  81,22,And your companion Mohammed is not distracted
  81,23,He had already seen him in the clear horizon
  81,24,And he suspected not the secrets revealed unto him
  81,25,Neither are these the words of an accursed devil
  81,26,"Whither, therefore, are ye going"
  81,27,This is no other than an admonition unto all creatures
  81,28,unto him among you who shall be willing to walk uprightly
  81,29,"But ye shall not will, unless God willeth, the Lord of all creatures"
