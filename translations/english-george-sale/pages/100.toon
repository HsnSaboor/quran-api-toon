quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,135,"O true believers, observe justice when ye bear witness before God, although it be against your selves, or your parents, or relations; whether the party be rich, or whether he be poor; for God is more worthy than them both: Therefore follow not your own lust in bearing testimony, so that ye swerve from justice. And whether ye wrest your evidence, or decline giving it, God is well acquainted with that which ye do"
  4,136,"O true believers, believe in God and his apostle, and the book which he hath caused to descend unto his apostle, and the book which He hath formerly sent down. And whosoever believeth not in God, and his angels, and his scriptures, and his apostles, and the last day, he surely erreth in a wide mistake"
  4,137,"Moreover they who believed, and afterwards became infidels, and then believed again, and after that disbelieved, and increased in infidelity, God will by no means forgive them, nor direct them into the right way"
  4,138,Declare unto the ungodly that they shall suffer a painful punishment
  4,139,"They who take the unbelievers for their protectors, besides the faithful, do they seek for power with them? Since all power belongeth unto God"
  4,140,"And he hath already revealed unto you, in the book of the Koran, the following passage, when ye shall hear the signs of God, they shall not be believed, but they shall be laughed to scorn. Therefore sit not with them who believe not, until they engage in different discourse; for if ye do ye will certainly become like unto them. God will surely gather the ungodly and the unbelievers together in hell"
