quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,25,What aileth you that ye defend not one another
  37,26,But on this day they shall submit themselves to the judgment of God
  37,27,"And they shall draw nigh unto one another, and shall dispute among themselves"
  37,28,"And the seduced shall say unto those who seduced them, verily ye came unto us with presages of prosperity"
  37,29,"and the seducers shall answer, nay, rather ye were not true believers"
  37,30,For we had no power over you to compel you; but ye were people who voluntarily transgressed
  37,31,"Wherefore the sentence of our Lord hath been justly pronounced against us, and we shall surely taste his vengeance"
  37,32,We seduced you; but we also erred ourselves
  37,33,They shall both thereof be made partakers of the same punishment on that day
  37,34,Thus will We deal with the wicked
  37,35,"Because when it is said unto them, there is no god besides the true God, they swell with arrogance"
  37,36,"and say, shall we abandon our gods for a distracted poet"
  37,37,"Nay; he cometh with the truth, and beareth witness to the former apostles"
  37,38,Ye shall surely taste the painful torment of hell
  37,39,"and ye shall not be rewarded, but according to your works"
  37,40,But as for the sincere servants of God
  37,41,they shall have a certain provision in paradise
  37,42,"namely, delicious fruits: And they shall be honoured"
  37,43,They shall be placed in gardens of pleasure
  37,44,"leaning on couches, opposite to one another"
  37,45,"A cup shall be carried round unto them, filled from a limpid fountain"
  37,46,for the delight of those who drink
  37,47,"It shall not oppress the understanding, neither shall they be inebriated therewith"
  37,48,"And near them shall lie the virgins of paradise, refraining their looks from beholding any besides their spouses, having large black eyes"
  37,49,and resembling the eggs of an ostrich covered with feathers from the dust
  37,50,"And they shall turn the one unto the other, and shall ask one another questions"
  37,51,"And one of them shall say, verily I had an intimate friend while I lived in the world"
