quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,197,"The pilgrimage must be performed in the known months; whosoever therefore purposeth to go on pilgrimage therein, let him not know a woman, nor transgress, nor quarrel in the pilgrimage. The good which ye do, God knoweth it. Make provision for your journey; but the best provision is piety: And fear me, O ye of understanding"
  2,198,"It shall be no crime in you, if ye seek an increase from your Lord, by trading during the pilgrimage. And when ye go in procession from Arafat, remember God near the holy monument; and remember him for that he hath directed you, although ye were before this of the number of those who go astray"
  2,199,"Therefore go in procession from whence the people go in procession, and ask pardon of God, for God is gracious and merciful"
  2,200,"And when ye have finished your holy ceremonies, remember God, according as ye remember your fathers, or with a more reverend commemoration. There are some men who say, O Lord, give us our portion in this world; but such shall have no portion in the next life"
  2,201,"And there are others who say, O Lord, give us good in this world, and also good in the next world, and deliver us from the torment of hell fire"
  2,202,"They shall have a portion of that which they have gained: God is swift in taking an account"
