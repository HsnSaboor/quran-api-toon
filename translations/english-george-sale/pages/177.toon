  8,1,"They ask thee concerning the spoils. Say, 'The spoils of war are for God and the Messenger. So fear God, and set things right among yourselves, and obey God and His Messenger, if you are believers"
  8,2,"They are only the true believers whose hearts tremble when the name of God is mentioned, and when His Signs are recited to them they increase their faith, and who put their trust in their Lord"
  8,3,Who observe Prayer and spend out of that which We have provided for them
  8,4,"These it is who are true believers. They have exalted grades of rank with their Lord, as well as forgiveness and an honourable provision"
  8,5,This is because thy Lord has brought thee forth from thy house for a righteous purpose while a party of the believers were quite averse to it
  8,6,"They (the disbelievers) dispute with thee concerning the truth after it has become manifest, as though they are being driven to death while they actually see it"
  8,7,"And remember when God promised you one of the two parties that it should be yours, and you wished that the one unarmed should be yours, but God desired to establish the Truth by His words and to cut off the root of the disbelievers"
  8,8,"That He might establish the Truth and bring to naught that which is false, although the guilty may dislike it"
