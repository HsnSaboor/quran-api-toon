quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  56,51,"Then ye, O men, who have erred, and denied the resurrection as a falsehood"
  56,52,shall surely eat of the fruit of the tree of al Zakkum
  56,53,and shall fill your bellies therewith
  56,54,And ye shall drink thereon boiling water
  56,55,and ye shall drink as a thirsty camel drinketh
  56,56,This shall be their entertainment on the day of judgment
  56,57,"We have created you: Will ye not therefore believe that We can raise you from the dead"
  56,58,What think ye? The seed which ye emit
  56,59,"do ye create the same, or are we the creators thereof"
  56,60,"We have decreed death unto you all: And We shall not be prevented"
  56,61,"We are able to substitute others like unto you in your stead, and to produce you again in the condition or form which ye know not"
  56,62,Ye know the original production by creation; will ye not therefore consider that We are able to reproduce you by resuscitation
  56,63,What think ye? The grain which ye sow
  56,64,"do ye cause the same to spring forth, or do We cause it to spring forth"
  56,65,"If We pleased, verily We could render the same dry and fruitless, so that ye would not cease to wonder, saying"
  56,66,verily we have contracted debts for seed and labour
  56,67,but we are not permitted to reap the fruit thereof
  56,68,What think ye? The water which ye drink
  56,69,"do ye send down the same from the clouds, or are We the senders thereof"
  56,70,"If We pleased, We could render the same brackish: Will ye not therefore give thanks"
  56,71,What think ye? The fire which ye strike
  56,72,"do ye produce the tree whence ye obtain the same, or are We the producers thereof"
  56,73,"We have ordained the same for an admonition, and an advantage unto those who travel through the deserts"
  56,74,"Wherefore praise the name of thy Lord, the great God"
  56,75,Moreover I swear by the setting of the stars
  56,76,"and it is surely a great oath, if ye knew it"
