quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  48,29,"Mohammed is the apostle of God: And those who are with him are fierce against the unbelievers, but compassionate towards one another. Thou mayest see them bowing down, prostrate, seeking a recompense from God, and his good will. Their signs are in their faces, being marks of frequent prostration. This is their description in the pentateuch, and their description in the gospel: They are as seed which putteth forth its stalk, and strengtheneth it, and swelleth in the ear, and riseth upon its stem; giving delight unto the sower. Such are the Moslems described to be: That the infidels may swell with indignation at them. God hath promised unto such of them as believe, and do good works, pardon and a great reward"
  49,1,"O true believers, anticipate not any matter in the sight of God and his apostle: And fear God; for God both heareth and knoweth"
  49,2,"O true believers, raise not your voices above the voice of the prophet; neither speak loud unto him in discourse, as ye speak loud unto one another, lest your works become vain, and ye perceive it not"
  49,3,"Verily they who lower their voices in the presence of the apostle of God, are those whose hearts God hath disposed unto piety: They shall obtain pardon, and a great reward"
  49,4,"As to those who call unto thee from without the inner apartments, the greater part of them do not understand the respect due to thee"
