quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,46,"We also caused Jesus the son of Mary to follow the footsteps of the prophets, confirming the law which was sent down before him; and we gave him the gospel, containing direction and light; confirming also the law which was given before it, and a direction and admonition unto those who fear God"
  5,47,"That they who have received the gospel might judge according to what God hath revealed therein: And whoso judgeth not according to what God hath revealed, they are transgressors"
  5,48,"We have also sent down unto thee the book of the Koran with truth, confirming that scripture which was revealed before it; and preserving the same safe from corruption. Judge therefore between them according to that which God hath revealed; and follow not their desires, by swerving from the truth which hath come unto thee. Unto every of you have we given a law, and an open path; and if God had pleased, he had surely made you one people; but he hath thought fit to give you different laws, that he might try you in that which he hath given you respectively. Therefore strive to excel each other in good works: Unto God shall ye all return, and then will he declare unto you that concerning which ye have disagreed"
  5,49,"Wherefore do thou, O prophet, judge between them according to that which God hath revealed and follow not their desires; but beware of them, lest they cause thee to err from part of those precepts which God hath sent down unto thee; and if they turn back, know that God is pleased to punish them for some of their crimes; for a great number of men are transgressors"
  5,50,"Do they therefore desire the judgment of the time of ignorance? But who is better than God, to judge between people who reason aright"
