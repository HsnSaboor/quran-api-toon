quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,59,Nothing hindered Us from sending Our Signs except that the people of olden times rejected them as lies. We publicly sent the she-camel to the Thamud to open their eyes but they wronged her. We never send Our Signs except to cause people to fear
  17,60,"And recall when We said to you, (O Muhammad), that your Lord encompasses these people; and that We have made that vision that We have shown you, and the tree accursed in the Qur'an, but as a trial for people. We go about warning them, but each warning leads them to greater transgression"
  17,61,"And recall when We asked the angels to prostrate themselves before Adam; all prostrated themselves except Iblis, who said: \"Shall I prostrate myself before him whom You created of clay"
  17,62,"He then continued: \"Look! This is he whom You have exalted above me! If you will grant me respite till the Day of Resurrection I shall uproot the whole of his progeny except only a few"
  17,63,"Thereupon He retorted: \"Be gone! Hell shall be the recompense - and a most ample one - of whosoever of them who follows you"
  17,64,"Tempt with your call all whom you wish. Muster against them all your forces - your cavalry and your foot soldiers; share with them riches and offspring, and seduce them with rosy promises - and Satan's promise is nothing but a deception"
  17,65,but know well that you will have no power against My servants. Your Lord suffices for them to place their trust in
  17,66,Your Lord is He Who steers your vessels across the seas that you may seek of His Bounty. He is ever Merciful towards you
