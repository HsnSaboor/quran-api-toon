quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,137,This has been happening all along
  26,138,We will not be subjected to any chastisement
  26,139,"Eventually they gave the lie to him and We destroyed them. Surely there is a Sign in this, but most of them would not believe"
  26,140,"Verily your Lord is Immensely Mighty, Most Compassionate"
  26,141,The Thamud gave the lie to the Messengers
  26,142,"Recall when their brother Salih said to them: \"Have you no fear"
  26,143,I am a trustworthy Messenger to you
  26,144,So fear Allah and obey me
  26,145,I ask of you no reward. My reward is with none but the Lord of the Universe
  26,146,Do you believe that you will be left here to live securely in the present state
  26,147,amidst gardens and springs
  26,148,and cornfields and date-palms laden with juicy fruits
  26,149,You hew dwellings in mountains and exult in that
  26,150,Fear Allah and obey me
  26,151,and do not follow the biddings of those that go to excesses
  26,152,and spread mischief in the land rather than set things right
  26,153,"They replied: \"You are nothing but one of those who are bewitched"
  26,154,you are no different from a mortal like us. So produce a sign if you are truthful
  26,155,"Salih said: \"This is a she-camel. There is a day set for her to drink and there is a day set for you to drink"
  26,156,Do not molest her lest the chastisement of an Awesome Day should seize you
  26,157,But they hamstrung her and then regretted it
  26,158,"So the chastisement seized them. Surely there is a Sign in this, but most of them would not believe"
  26,159,"Verily Your Lord is Immensely Mighty, Most Compassionate"
