quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  20,65,"The magicians said: \"Moses, will you throw down or shall we be the first to throw"
  20,66,"Moses replied: \"No, let it be you to throw first.\" Then suddenly it appeared to Moses, owing to their magic, as if their ropes and staffs were running"
  20,67,So Moses' heart was filled with fear
  20,68,"We said to him: \"Have no fear; for it is you who will prevail"
  20,69,"And throw down what is in your right hand; it will swallow up all that they have wrought. They have wrought only a magician's stratagem. A magician cannot come to any good, come whence he may"
  20,70,"Eventually the magicians were impelled to fall down prostrate and said: \"We believe in the Lord of Moses and Aaron"
  20,71,"Pharaoh said: \"What! Did you believe in Him even before I permitted you to do so? Surely, he must be your chief who taught you magic. Now I will certainly cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and will crucify you on the trunks of palm-trees, and then you will come to know which of us can inflict sterner and more lasting torment"
  20,72,"The magicians answered: \"By Him Who has created us, we shall never prefer you to the Truth after manifest Signs have come to us. So decree whatever you will. Your decree will pertain, at the most, to the present life of the world"
  20,73,We believe in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and also forgive us the practice of magic to which you had compelled us. Allah is the Best and He alone will abide
  20,74,The truth is that Hell awaits him who comes to his Lord laden with sin; he shall neither die in it nor live
  20,75,But he who comes to Him with faith and righteous works shall be exalted to high ranks
  20,76,and shall live for ever in everlasting Gardens beneath which rivers flow. Such will be the reward of those who purify themselves
