quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,27,"And again, on the Day of Resurrection, He will bring them to disgrace, and say: \"Tell Me, now, where are those to whom you ascribed a share in My Divinity, and for whose sake you disputed (with the upholders of the Truth)?\" Those who were endowed with knowledge (in the world) will say: \"Surely today humiliation and misery shall be the lot of the unbelievers"
  16,28,"the same unbelievers who, when the angels seize them and cause them to die while they are engaged in wrong-doing, they will proffer their submission saying: \"We were engaged in no evil.\" (The angels will answer them): \"Surely Allah knows well all that you did"
  16,29,"Go now, and enter the gate of Hell, and abide in it for ever. \" Evil indeed is the abode of the arrogant"
  16,30,"And when the God-fearing are asked: \"What has your Lord revealed?\" they answer: \"Something excellent!\" Good fortune in this world awaits those who do good; and certainly the abode of the Hereafter is even better for them. How excellent is the abode of the God-fearing"
  16,31,"everlasting gardens that they shall enter; the gardens beneath which rivers shall flow, and where they shall have whatever they desire! Thus does Allah reward the God-fearing"
  16,32,"those whose souls the angels seize while they are in a state of purity, saying: \"Peace be upon you. Enter Paradise as a reward for your deeds"
  16,33,"(O Muhammad), are they waiting for anything else than that the angels should appear before them, or that your Lord's judgement should come? Many before them acted with similar temerity. And then what happened with them was not Allah's wrong-doing; they rather wronged themselves"
  16,34,The evil consequences of their misdeeds overtook them and what they mocked at overwhelmed them
