quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  12,5,"His father said: \"My son! Do not relate your dream to your brothers lest they hatch a plot to harm you. Indeed Satan is man's open enemy"
  12,6,"(As you have seen in the dream), so will your Lord choose you (for His task) and will impart to you the comprehension of the deeper meaning of things and will bestow the full measure of His favour upon you and upon the house of Jacob even as He earlier bestowed it in full measure upon your forefathers, Abraham and Isaac. Surely your Lord is All- Knowing, All-Wise"
  12,7,Verily in the story of Joseph and his brothers there are many signs for those who inquire (about the truth)
  12,8,"And call to mind when the brothers of Joseph conferred together and said: \"Surely Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are, although we are a group of so many. Our father is clearly mistaken"
  12,9,So either kill Joseph or cast him into some distant land so that your father's attention may become exclusively yours. And after so doing become righteous
  12,10,"Thereupon one of them said: \"Do not kill Joseph, but if you are bent upon doing something, cast him down to the bottom of some dark pit, perhaps some caravan passing by will take him out of it"
  12,11,"After so deciding they said to their father: \"Why is it that you do not trust us regarding Joseph although we are his true well-wishers"
  12,12,"Send him out with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play while we will be there, standing guard over him"
  12,13,"Their father answered: \"It grieves me indeed that you should take him with you for I fear that some wolf might eat him up while you are negligent of him"
  12,14,"They said: \"Should a wolf eat him, despite the presence of our strong group, we would indeed be a worthless lot"
