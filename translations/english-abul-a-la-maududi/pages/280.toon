  16,112,"Allah sets forth the parable of (the people of) a town who were secure and content and whose sustenance came in abundance from every quarter.

  16,116,"And do not utter falsehoods by letting your tongues declare: \"This is lawful\" and \"That is unlawful,\" thus fabricating lies against Allah. Surely those who fabricate lies against Allah will never prosper"
