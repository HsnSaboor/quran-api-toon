quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star when it sets
  53,2,your companion has neither strayed nor is he deluded
  53,3,nor does he speak out of his desire
  53,4,This is nothing but a revelation that is conveyed to him
  53,5,something that a very powerful one has imparted to him
  53,6,one endowed with immense wisdom. He came forth and stood poised
  53,7,being on the higher horizon
  53,8,Then he drew near and hung above suspended
  53,9,"until he was two bows' length away, or nearer"
  53,10,Then he revealed to Allah's servant whatever he had to reveal
  53,11,His heart added no untruth to what he saw
  53,12,"Are you, then, going to contend with him regarding what he sees with his eyes"
  53,13,Indeed he saw him a second time
  53,14,by the lote-tree at the farthest boundary
  53,15,near which is the Garden of Abode
  53,16,(This was) when the lote-tree was covered with that which covered it
  53,17,"His eye did not waver, nor did it stray"
  53,18,and he certainly saw some of the greatest Signs of His Lord
  53,19,Have you ever thought about al-Lat and al-Uzza
  53,20,"and about the third deity, al-Manat"
  53,21,"Shall you have the male issues, and He the female issues"
  53,22,That is indeed an unfair division
  53,23,"These are nothing but names that you and your forefathers have invented, for which Allah has sent down no authority. They are merely following their conjectures and their carnal desires although guidance has come to them from their Lord"
  53,24,Does man imagine that whatever he wishes for is right for him
  53,25,To Allah belong both the Next World and the present
  53,26,"Numerous are the angels in the heavens; yet their intercession shall be of no avail, except in regard to those whom He grants the leave of intercession and whose plea He is pleased to accept"
