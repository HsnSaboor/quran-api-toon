quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,88,"The haughty elders of his people said: 'O Shu'ayb! We shall certainly banish you and your companions-in-faith from our town, or else you shall return to our faith.' Shu'ayb said: 'What! Even though we abhor [your faith]"
  7,89,"If we return to your faith after Allah has delivered us from it we would be fabricating a lie against Allah. nor can we return to it again unless it be by, the will of Allah, our Lord.

  7,90,"The elders of his people who disbelieved said: 'Should you follow Shu'ayb, you will be utter losers"
  7,91,"Thereupon a shocking catastrophe seized them, and they remained prostrate in their dwellings"
  7,92,Those who had charged Shu'ayb with lying became as though-they had never lived there; it is they who became utter losers
  7,93,"Shu'ayb then departed from his people, and said: 'O my people! Surely I conveyed to you the message of my Lord, and gave you sincere advice. How, then, can I mourn for a people who refuse to accept the truth"
  7,94,Never have We sent a Prophet to a place without trying its people with adversity and hardship that they may humble themselves
  7,95,"Then We changed adversity into ease until they throve and said: 'Our forefathers had also seen both adversity and prosperity.' So We suddenly seized them without their even perceiving it"
