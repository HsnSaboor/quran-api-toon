quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,"By the heaven, and the night-visitor"
  86,2,what do you know what the night-visitor is
  86,3,It is the piercing star
  86,4,There is no living being but there is a protector over it
  86,5,So let man consider of what he was created
  86,6,He was created of a gushing fluid
  86,7,emanating from between the loins and the ribs
  86,8,Surely He (the Creator) has the power to bring him back (to life)
  86,9,On the Day when man's deepest secrets shall be put to the test
  86,10,"he shall have no power, and no helper"
  86,11,By the heaven with its recurring cycle of rain
  86,12,and by the earth ever bursting with verdure
  86,13,this (Qur'an) is surely a decisive Word
  86,14,not a flippant jest
  86,15,They are devising a guile
  86,16,and I too am devising a guile
  86,17,So leave the unbelievers to themselves; respite them awhile
  87,1,"Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High"
  87,2,Who created all things and fashioned them in good proportion
  87,3,Who determined and guided them
  87,4,Who brought forth the pasture
  87,5,and then made it into a blackish straw
  87,6,We shall make you recite and then you will not forget
  87,7,except what Allah should wish. He knows all that is manifest and all that is hidden
  87,8,We shall ease you to follow the way of Ease
  87,9,So render good counsel if good counsel will avail
  87,10,He who fears (Allah) shall heed it
  87,11,but the wretched will turn away from it
  87,12,He will be cast into the Great Fire
  87,13,"Then he will neither die in it, nor live"
  87,14,He who purified himself shall prosper
  87,15,remembering his Lord's name and praying
