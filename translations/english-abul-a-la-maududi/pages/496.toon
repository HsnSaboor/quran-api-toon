quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  44,1,Ha'. Mim
  44,2,By the Clear Book
  44,3,"We revealed it on a Blessed Night, for We were intent on warning"
  44,4,(We revealed it on the Night) wherein every matter is wisely determined
  44,5,"by Our command. Verily, We were set to send a Messenger"
  44,6,"as a Mercy from your Lord. Surely He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing"
  44,7,"the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of all that is between them: if you would only have sure faith"
  44,8,"There is no god but He: He gives life and causes death. He is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers of yore"
  44,9,"(But the fact is, they lack certainty) and frolic about in doubt"
  44,10,So watch for the Day when the sky will come down with a pall of smoke
  44,11,enveloping people. That will be a grievous scourge
  44,12,"(People will then say): “Our Lord, remove this scourge from us; we shall believe.”"
  44,13,But how will they take heed? Such are they that a Messenger came to them clearly expounding the Truth
  44,14,"yet they turned away from him and said: “This is a well-tutored madman.”"
  44,15,"Yet We will hold the scourge back for a while, (but no sooner than We will do so) you will revert to your old ways"
  44,16,"The Day when We shall seize them with a mighty seizing, that will be the Day on which We shall inflict upon you full retribution"
  44,17,Indeed before that We subjected the Pharaonites to the same test. A noble Messenger came to them
  44,18,"(and said): “Deliver to me Allah's servants. I am a trustworthy Messenger to you"
