quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"who used to say: -- Are you also one of those who confirm the Truth (of life after death)"
  37,53,After we are dead and have become all dust and bones shall we still be requited
  37,54,"He will say: -- Do you wish to know where he is now"
  37,55,"Then he will look downwards, and will see him in the depths of Hell"
  37,56,"He will say to him: -- By Allah, you almost ruined me"
  37,57,"But for Allah's favour, I should be one of those who have been mustered here"
  37,58,"So, are we not going to die"
  37,59,except for our first death? And shall we suffer no chastisement?'”
  37,60,Surely this is the supreme triumph
  37,61,For the like of it should the workers work
  37,62,Is this a better hospitality or the tree of al-Zaqqum
  37,63,We have made this tree a trial for the wrong-doers
  37,64,It is a tree that grows in the nethermost part of Hell
  37,65,Its spathes are like the heads of satans
  37,66,"(The people of Hell) will surely eat of it, filling their bellies with it"
  37,67,Then on top of it they will have a brew of boiling water
  37,68,Then their return will be to the same blazing Hell
  37,69,These are the ones who found their fathers steeped in error
  37,70,and they are running in their footsteps
  37,71,Before them a multitude of people of olden times had erred
  37,72,and We had sent among them Messengers to warn them
  37,73,"Observe, then, what was the end of those that had been warned"
  37,74,except for the chosen servants of Allah
  37,75,"Noah had called upon Us (earlier). See, how excellent We were in answering him"
  37,76,We delivered him and his household from the great calamity
