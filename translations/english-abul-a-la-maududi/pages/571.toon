quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  71,11,He will shower upon you torrents from heaven
  71,12,"and will provide you with wealth and children, and will bestow upon you gardens and rivers"
  71,13,What is amiss with you that you do not look forward to the majesty of Allah
  71,14,when He has created you in stages
  71,15,"Do you not see how Allah has created seven heavens, one upon the other"
  71,16,"and has placed the moon in them as a light, and the sun as a radiant lamp"
  71,17,And Allah has caused you to grow out of the earth so wondrously
  71,18,and He will later cause you to return to it and will then again bring you out of it
  71,19,Allah has made the earth a wide expanse for you
  71,20,so that you may tread its spacious paths.”
  71,21,"Noah said: “My Lord, they did not pay heed to what I said, and followed those (nobles) whose possession of wealth and children has led them to an even greater loss"
  71,22,They contrived a plot of great magnitude
  71,23,"They said: “Do not abandon your deities; do not abandon Wadd, nor Suwa, nor Yaghuth, nor Yauq, nor Nasr"
  71,24,They have misled many. So do not enable these evildoers to increase in anything except straying (from the Right Way).”
  71,25,"And so they were drowned on account of their sins, and then cast into the Fire, and did not find any other than Allah, to come forth to their help"
  71,26,"Noah said: “My Lord, do not leave out of these unbelievers even a single dweller on earth"
  71,27,"for certainly if You should leave them (alive), they will mislead Your servants, and will beget none but sinners and utter unbelievers"
  71,28,"My Lord, forgive me and my parents, and whoever enters my house as a believer, and forgive all believers, both men and women, and do not increase the wrong-doers in anything except perdition.”"
