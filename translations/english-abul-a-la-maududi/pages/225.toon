quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,My people! I seek no recompense from you. My recompense is only with Allah. Nor will I drive away those who believe. They are destined to meet their Lord. But I find you to be an ignorant people
  11,30,"My people! Were I to drive the men of faith away, who will protect me from (the chastisement of) Allah? Do you not understand even this much"
  11,31,"I do not say to you that I possess Allah's treasures, nor that I have access to the realm beyond the ken of sense-perception, nor do I claim to be an angel. Nor do I say regarding those whom you look upon with disdain that Allah will not bestow any good upon them. Allah knows best what is in their hearts. Were I to say so I would be one of the wrongdoers"
  11,32,"They said: 'O Noah! Surely you have disputed with us and have prolonged your dispute. Now bring upon us the chastisement that you threaten us with; do so, if you are truthful"
  11,33,"Noah said: 'Only Allah will bring it upon you if He so wills, and you will be utterly unable to frustrate that"
  11,34,"If I want to give you good advice that will not profit you if Allah Himself has decided to let you go astray. He is your Lord, and to Him will you be returned"
  11,35,"(O Muhammad!) Do they say that he himself has forged this message? Tell them: 'If I have forged this, the guilt of it will fall upon me, but I am not responsible for the crimes you are committing"
  11,36,"It was revealed to Noah that no more of your people, other than those who already believe, will ever come to believe. So do not grieve over their deeds"
  11,37,and build the Ark under Our eyes and Our direction. And do not supplicate Me concerning those who have engaged in wrong-doing. They are doomed to be drowned
