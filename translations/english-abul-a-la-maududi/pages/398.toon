quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  29,15,"Then We rescued Noah together with the people in the Ark and made it (that is, the Ark) a lesson for all people"
  29,16,"We sent Abraham and he said to his people: “Serve Allah and fear Him. This is better for you if you only knew"
  29,17,"Those that you worship instead of Allah are merely idols, and you are simply inventing lies (about them). Indeed those whom you worship beside Allah have no power to provide you with any sustenance. So seek your sustenance from Allah and serve only Him and give thanks to Him alone. It is to Him that you will be sent back"
  29,18,"And if you give the lie (to the Messenger), then many nations before you also gave the lie (to their Messengers). The Messenger is charged with no other duty than to deliver the Message in clear terms.”"
  29,19,Have they never observed how Allah creates for the first time and then repeats it? Indeed (to repeat the creation of a thing) is even easier for Allah (than creating it for the first time)
  29,20,"Say: “Go about the earth and see how He created for the first time, and then Allah will recreate life.” Surely, Allah has power over everything"
  29,21,He chastises whom He will and forgives whom He will. To Him all of you will be sent back
  29,22,"You cannot overpower Allah, neither on the earth nor in the heaven. None can protect you from Allah nor come to your aid against Him"
  29,23,"Those who disbelieved in Allah's signs and in meeting Him, it is they who have despaired of My Mercy; it is they for whom a painful chastisement lies ahead"
