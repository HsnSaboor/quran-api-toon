quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,Surely the state of triumph awaits the God-fearing
  78,32,gardens and vineyards
  78,33,and youthful maidens of like age
  78,34,and an overflowing cup
  78,35,"Therein they shall hear no idle talk, nor any falsehood"
  78,36,a recompense from your Lord and an ample reward
  78,37,from the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of that which is between them; the Most Merciful Lord before Whom none dare utter a word
  78,38,The Day when the Spirit and the angels are ranged row on row. None shall speak save he whom the Merciful Lord will permit; and he too will speak what is right
  78,39,That Day is sure to come. So let him who will seek a resort with his Lord
  78,40,"Lo! We warn you of a chastisement near at hand; the Day when a man will look on what his own hands have sent forth, and the unbelievers shall say: “Oh would that I were utter dust.”"
  79,1,By those (angels) that pluck out the soul from depths
  79,2,and gently take it away
  79,3,and by those that speedily glide along (the cosmos)
  79,4,and vie with the others (in carrying out their Lord's behests)
  79,5,and then manage the affairs of the Universe (according to their Lord's commands)
  79,6,The Day when the quaking will cause a violent convulsion
  79,7,and will be followed by another quaking
  79,8,On that Day some hearts shall tremble (with fright)
  79,9,and their eyes shall be downcast with dread
  79,10,"They say: “Shall we indeed be restored to life"
  79,11,"even after we have been reduced to bones, hollow and rotten?”"
  79,12,"They say: “That will then be a return with a great loss!”"
  79,13,Surely they will need no more than a single stern blast
  79,14,"and lo, they will all be in the open plain"
  79,15,Has Moses' story reached you
