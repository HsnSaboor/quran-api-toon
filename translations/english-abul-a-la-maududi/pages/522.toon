quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"Abraham said: “Envoys (of Allah), what is your errand?”"
  51,32,"They replied: “Behold, we have been sent to a wicked people"
  51,33,that we may unleash a shower of clay-stones
  51,34,marked by your Lord upon those who go beyond the limits.”
  51,35,Then We evacuated there from all the believers
  51,36,"– and We did not find there any, apart from a single house of Muslims –"
  51,37,and We left therein a Sign for those who fear the grievous chastisement
  51,38,There is also a Sign for you in the story of Moses when We sent him with a clear authority to Pharaoh
  51,39,"But Pharaoh turned away, showing arrogance on account of his power, and said (about Moses): “He is either a sorcerer or a madman.”"
  51,40,"So We seized him and his hosts, and cast them into the sea. He became an object of much blame"
  51,41,"There is also a Sign for you in (the story of) Ad, when We let loose upon them an ominous wind"
  51,42,that left nothing that it came upon without reducing it to rubble
  51,43,"There is also a Sign for you in (the story of) Thamud. They were told: “Enjoy yourselves for a while.”"
  51,44,"But they brazenly disobeyed their Lord's command, and then a sudden chastisement overtook them while they looked on"
  51,45,They were unable even to stand up or protect themselves
  51,46,"Before all these We destroyed the people of Noah: they were a wicked people"
  51,47,And heaven – We made it with Our Own Power and We have the Power to do so
  51,48,"And the earth – We spread it out, and how well have We smoothed it"
  51,49,And of everything We have created pairs; perhaps you will take heed
  51,50,"Flee, therefore, to Allah. Surely I am a clear warner to you from Him"
  51,51,and do not set up any deity with Allah. Surely I am a clear warner to you from Him
