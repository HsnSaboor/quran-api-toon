quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,184,and have fear of Him Who created you and the earlier generations
  26,185,"They said: \"You are no more than one of those who have been bewitched"
  26,186,you are only a mortal like us. Indeed we believe that you are an utter liar
  26,187,So cause a piece of the sky to fall upon us if you are truthful
  26,188,"Shuayb said: \"My Lord knows well all what you do"
  26,189,"Then they branded him a liar, whereupon the chastisement of the Day of Canopy overtook them. It was the chastisement of a very awesome day"
  26,190,"Surely there is a Sign in this, but most of them would not believe"
  26,191,"Verily Your Lord is Immensely Mighty, Most Compassionate"
  26,192,Indeed this is a revelation from the Lord of the Universe
  26,193,which the truthful spirit has carried down
  26,194,to your heart that you might become one of those who warn (others on behalf of Allah)
  26,195,(a revelation) in clear Arabic language
  26,196,(a revelation embodied) in the scriptures of the ancients
  26,197,"Is it not a Sign to them - (to wit, the Makkans) - that the learned men of the Children of Israel know that"
  26,198,(But such is their adamance) that had We revealed it to one of the non-Arabs and even if he had recited (this clear Arabic discourse) to them
  26,199,they would still not have believed in it
  26,200,Thus have We caused this (Admonition) to penetrate the hearts of the culprits (like a hot rod)
  26,201,They will not believe in it until they clearly see the grievous chastisement
  26,202,"But when it comes upon them suddenly, taking them unawares"
  26,203,"they say: \"Can we be granted some respite"
  26,204,Do they really want Our chastisement to be expedited
  26,205,Did you consider that if We were to let them enjoy life for many years
  26,206,and then the chastisement of which they were being warned were to come upon them
