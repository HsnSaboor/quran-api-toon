quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  43,11,"He Who sent down water from the sky in a determined measure, and thereby We revived a dead land: likewise will you be raised up (from the earth)"
  43,12,"He Who created these pairs, all of them, and provided you ships and cattle on which you ride"
  43,13,"so that when you are mounted upon them you may remember the bounty of your Lord, and say: “Glory be to Him Who has subjected this to Us whereas we did not have the strength to subdue it"
  43,14,It is to our Lord that we shall eventually return.”
  43,15,Yet they have made some of His servants a part of Him. Indeed man is most evidently thankless
  43,16,Has Allah taken for Himself daughters out of those whom He creates and has chosen you to have sons
  43,17,"(They believe so although when) any of them is given tidings of the birth of a female child the like of which he assigns to the Merciful One, his countenance darkens and he is choked with grief"
  43,18,Do they assign to Allah one who grows up amidst ornaments and is not well-versed in the art of disputation
  43,19,"They claim that angels, who are Allah's chosen servants, are females. Did they witness how their body is constituted? Their testimony shall be written and they shall be called to account"
  43,20,"They say: “Had the Merciful One so willed, we would never have worshipped these deities.” But they have no knowledge of the matter and are simply conjecturing"
  43,21,Or did We bestow upon them a Book before on whose authority they are holding on (to angel-worship)
  43,22,"Nay; they simply claim: “We found our forefathers on a way, and we continue to find guidance in their footsteps.”"
