quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,and the secrets of the hearts are laid bare (and examined)
  100,11,Surely on that Day will their Lord be fully informed about them
  101,1,The Calamity
  101,2,What is the Calamity
  101,3,And what do you know what the Calamity is
  101,4,On that Day human beings shall be like scattered moths
  101,5,and the mountains shall be like fluffs of carded wool in varying colours
  101,6,Then he whose scales weigh heavier
  101,7,shall have a blissful life
  101,8,but he whose scales weigh lighter
  101,9,his shall be the deep pit for a dwelling
  101,10,And what do you know what that is
  101,11,A Blazing Fire
  102,1,The craving for ever-greater worldly gains and to excel others in that regard keeps you occupied
  102,2,until you reach your graves
  102,3,"Nay, you will soon come to know"
  102,4,"nay, again, you shall soon come to know"
  102,5,"Nay, would that you knew with certainty of knowledge (what your attitude will lead to, you would never have acted the way you do)"
  102,6,You will surely end up seeing Hell
  102,7,"again, you shall most certainly end up seeing it with absolute certainty"
  102,8,"Then, on that Day, you will be called to account for all the bounties you enjoyed"
