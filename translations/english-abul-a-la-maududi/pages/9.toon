quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,58,"Then call to mind the time when We said, \"Go into the town' before you and eat to your hearts' content therein, wherefrom you will, but enter the gate bowing down with humility, repeating 'hittatun'; We will forgive your sins and increase the reward of the righteous"
  2,59,"But the transgressors perverted the words said to them entirely into a different thing. So We sent down upon the transgressors a severe torment from the sky: that was the punishment for the disobedience they were showing"
  2,60,"Remember that when Moses prayed for water for his people, We answered, \"Strike the rock with your staff\": whereupon twelve springs gushed forth from it; the people of every clan came to know their drinking place. (Then they were enjoined:) \"Eat and drink of what Allah has provided and do not spread disorder on the earth"
  2,61,"Remember: You grumbled: \"O Moses, we cannot endure one and the same sort of food. Pray your Lord to bring for us the products of the earth green herbs, vegetables, corn, garlic, onions, pulses and the like.\" Moses replied: \"What! would you exchange that which is meaner for that which is nobler? Well, go and live in a town and you will get there what you demand.\" By and by, they became so degraded that disgrace and humiliation, misery and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they incurred Allah's wrath. That was because they began to reject the Revelations of Allah and kill His Messengers without any just cause; that was the consequence of their disobedience and their persistent transgression against the Law"
