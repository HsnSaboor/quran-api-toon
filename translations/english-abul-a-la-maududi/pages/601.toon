quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By the time
  103,2,Lo! Man is in a state of loss
  103,3,"save those who have faith and do righteous deeds, and counsel each other to hold on to truth and counsel each other to be steadfast"
  104,1,Woe to every fault-finding backbiter
  104,2,who amasses wealth and counts it over and again
  104,3,He thinks that his wealth will immortalise him forever
  104,4,"Nay, he shall be thrown into the Crusher"
  104,5,And what do you know what the Crusher is
  104,6,It is the Fire kindled by Allah
  104,7,the Fire that shall rise to the hearts (of criminals)
  104,8,Verily it will close in upon them
  104,9,in outstretched columns
  105,1,Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the people of the elephants
  105,2,Did He not bring their plan to naught
  105,3,And He sent against them swarms of birds
  105,4,which smote them with stones of baked clay
  105,5,and made them like straw eaten up (by cattle)
