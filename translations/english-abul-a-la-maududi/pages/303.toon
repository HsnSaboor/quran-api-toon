quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  18,84,We granted him power in the land and endowed him with all kinds of resources
  18,85,He set out (westwards) on an expedition
  18,86,"until when he reached the very limits where the sun sets, he saw it setting in dark turbid waters; and nearby he met a people. We said: \"O Dhu al-Qarnayn, you have the power to punish or to treat them with kindness"
  18,87,"He said: \"We will chastise him who does wrong, whereafter he will be returned to his Lord and He will chastise him grievously"
  18,88,"But as for him who believes and acts righteously, his will be a goodly reward and we shall enjoin upon him only mild commands"
  18,89,Then he set out on another expedition
  18,90,until he reached the limit where the sun rises and he found it rising on a people whom We had provided no shelter from it
  18,91,"Thus was the state of those people, and We encompassed in knowledge all concerning Dhu al- Qarnayn"
  18,92,Then he set out on another expedition
  18,93,"until when he reached a place between the two mountains, he found beside the mountains a people who scarcely understood anything"
  18,94,"They said: \"O Dhu al-Qarnayn, Gog and Magog are spreading corruption in this land. So shall we pay you taxes on the understanding that you will set up a barrier between us and them"
  18,95,"He answered: \"Whatever my Lord has granted me is good enough. But help me with your labour and I will erect a rampart between you and them"
  18,96,"Bring me ingots of iron.\" Then after he had filled up the space between the two mountain-sides, he said: \"(Light a fire) and ply bellows.\" When he had made it (red like) fire, he said: \"Bring me molten copper which I may pour on it"
  18,97,"Such was the rampart that Gog and Magog could not scale, nor could they pierce it"
