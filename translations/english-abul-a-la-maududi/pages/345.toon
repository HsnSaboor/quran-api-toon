  23,44,"Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Whenever a Messenger came to his people they rejected him, calling him a liar. Thereupon, We made each people to follow the other (to its doom), reducing them to mere tales (of the past). Scourged be the people who do not believe"
  23,45,Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our Signs and a clear authority
  23,46,"to Pharaoh and to his chiefs, but they behaved superciliously and they were haughty"
  23,47,"They said: \"Shall we put faith in two mortals like ourselves when their people are slaves to us"

  23,56,"We are busy lavishing on them all kinds of good? Nay, they do not perceive the reality of the matter"
  23,57,Surely those who stand in awe for fear of their Lord
  23,58,who have full faith in the Signs of their Lord
  23,59,who associate none with their Lord in His Divinity
