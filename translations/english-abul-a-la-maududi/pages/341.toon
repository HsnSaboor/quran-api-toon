quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  22,73,"O people, a parable is set forth: pay heed to it. Those who call upon aught other than Allah shall never be able to create even a fly, even if all of them were to come together to do that. And if the fly were to snatch away anything from them, they would not be able to recover that from it. Powerless is the supplicant; and powerless is he to whom he supplicates"
  22,74,"They have not formed a true estimate of Allah. Indeed, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty"
  22,75,"Allah chooses Messengers from among angels and from among human beings (to convey His command). Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing"
  22,76,He knows all that is before them and that which is hidden from them. And it is to Allah that all affairs are returned
  22,77,"Believers, bow down and prostrate yourselves before Your Lord and serve Your Lord and do good that you may prosper"
  22,78,"Strive in the cause of Allah in a manner worthy of that striving. He has chosen you (for His task), and He has not laid upon you any hardship in religion. Keep to the faith of your father Abraham. Allah named you Muslims earlier and even in this (Book), that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and that you may be witnesses over all mankind. So establish Prayer, and pay Zakah, and hold fast to Allah. He is your Protector. What an excellent Protector; what an excellent Helper"
