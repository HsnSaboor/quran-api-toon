quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"But if We were to send a wind and then their tilth has become yellow, they would never cease to disbelieve"
  30,52,"(O Prophet), you cannot make the dead hear, nor can you make the deaf hear your call when they turn back in retreat"
  30,53,nor can you guide the blind out of their error. You can make none hear (your call) except those who believe in Our Signs and have surrendered themselves (to Him)
  30,54,"It is Allah Who created you in a state of weakness; then after weakness He gave you strength, then after strength He made you weak and old. He creates what He pleases. He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful"
  30,55,On that Day when the Hour will come to pass the wicked shall swear that they had stayed (in the world) no more than an hour. Thus they used to be deceived in the life of the world
  30,56,"But those who had been endowed with knowledge and faith shall say: “According to Allah's Record you have stayed till the Day of Resurrection. Now, this is the Day of Resurrection. But you did not know.”"
  30,57,"So that will be the Day when the excuses of the wrong-doers will not avail them, nor will they be asked to make amends"
  30,58,"In the Qur'an We have explained things to people in myriad ways. But no matter what Sign you bring to them, those who are resolved upon denying the Truth will say: “You are given to falsehood.”"
  30,59,Thus does Allah seal the hearts of those who have no knowledge
  30,60,"Therefore, (O Prophet), have patience. Surely Allah's promise is true. Let those who lack certainty not cause you to be unsteady"
