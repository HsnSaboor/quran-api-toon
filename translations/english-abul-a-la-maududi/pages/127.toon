quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,114,"Jesus, son of Mary, then prayed: 'O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a repast from the heavens that shall be a festival for the first of us and for the last of us, and a sign from You. And provide us with sustenance, for You are the best Provider of sustenance"
  5,115,"Allah said: 'I shall indeed send it down to you; then, I shall afflict whoever among you who disbelieves with a chastisement wherewith I will afflict none in the worlds"
  5,116,"And imagine when thereafter Allah will say: 'Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to people: \"Take me and my mother for gods beside Allah?\" and he will answer: \"Glory to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right to. Had I said so, You would surely have known it. You know all what is within my mind whereas I do not know what is within Yours. You, indeed You, know fully all that is beyond the reach of human perception"
  5,117,"I said to them nothing except what You commanded me, that is: 'Serve Allah, my Lord and your Lord.' I watched over them as long as I remained among them; and when You did recall me, then You Yourself became the Watcher over them. Indeed, You are Witness over everything"
  5,118,"If You chastise them, they are Your servants; and if You forgive them, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise"
  5,119,"Thereupon Allah will say: 'This day truthfulness shall profit the truthful. For them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow. There they will abide for ever. Allah is well- pleased with them, and they well-pleased with Allah. That indeed is the mighty triumph"
  5,120,To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them and He has full power over everything
