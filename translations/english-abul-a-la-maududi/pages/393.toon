quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  28,60,Whatever you have been given is a provision for the life of this world and its glitter. But that which is with Allah is better and more enduring. Do you not use your intellect
  28,61,"Now, he to whom We have promised a good which he is going to obtain - can he be like him whom We have given the good things of this life, but who will be brought up for punishment on the Day of Judgement"
  28,62,"(Let them not forget) that the Day when Allah will call unto them, and say: \"Where are those whom you imagined to be My associates"
  28,63,"Those against whom the Word will be realised will say: \"Our Lord, these are the ones whom we led astray just as we ourselves strayed. We absolve ourselves before You of all blame. It was not us that they worshipped"
  28,64,"They will then be told: \"Call upon those for help whom you declared to be Our associates.\" They will then call upon them but they will not answer them. They will have observed the chastisement in front of them. Would that they were guided"
  28,65,"(Let them not disregard) that the Day when Allah will call out to them saying: \"What was the answer you gave to the Messengers"
  28,66,"Then they will not be able to think of any reply, nor will they be able to ask one another"
  28,67,"But those who repented and believed and acted righteously, they will perhaps be among those who will prosper there"
  28,68,Your Lord creates what He will and chooses (for His tasks) whomsoever He will. It is not for them to make the choice. Glory be to Allah. He is exalted far above their associating others in His Divinity
  28,69,Your Lord knows all that their hearts conceal and all that they reveal
  28,70,He is Allah; there is no god but He. His is the praise in this world and in the Hereafter. His is the command and to Him will all of you be returned
