quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  69,9,Pharaoh and those before him and the people of the overturned habitations all engaged in the same great sin
  69,10,"They did not follow the Messenger of their Lord, and so He seized them with a severe grip"
  69,11,"Verily when the water rose to great heights, We bore you upon a floating vessel (i.e. the Ark)"
  69,12,"so that We might make it an instructive event for you, and retentive ears might preserve its memory"
  69,13,So when the Trumpet is blown with a single blast
  69,14,and the earth and the mountains are carried aloft and are crushed to bits at one stroke
  69,15,on that Day shall that indubitable event come to pass
  69,16,"when the sky will be rent asunder, the grip holding it together having loosened on that Day"
  69,17,"and the angels will stand on the sides, with eight of them bearing aloft the Throne of your Lord on that Day"
  69,18,That will be the Day when you shall be brought forth (before Allah) and no secret of yours shall remain hidden
  69,19,"On that Day, he whose Record is given to him in his right hand will say: “Lo! Read my Record"
  69,20,Verily I was sure that I would be handed over my account.”
  69,21,Then he shall find himself in a life of bliss
  69,22,in a lofty Garden
  69,23,the clusters of whose fruit will be hanging low to be within reach (of the inmates of Paradise)
  69,24,"(They will be told): “Eat and drink with good cheer as a reward for the good deeds you did in the days that have passed by.”"
  69,25,"As for him whose Record will be given to him in his left hand, he will exclaim: “Would that I had never been given my Record"
  69,26,and had not known my account
  69,27,Oh! Would that the death that came to me in the world had made an end of me
  69,28,My riches have not availed me
  69,29,and my authority has vanished.”
  69,30,"(A command will be issued): “Seize him and shackle him"
  69,31,then cast him in the Fire
  69,32,"then fasten him with a chain, seventy cubits long"
  69,33,"He would not believe in Allah, the Most Great"
  69,34,nor would he urge the feeding of the poor
