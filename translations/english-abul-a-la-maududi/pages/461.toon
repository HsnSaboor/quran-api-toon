quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,"Can he whose breast Allah has opened up for Islam and who is thus (moving along a Path) illumined by a light from Allah (be likened to him who derives no lesson from what he observes)? Woe, then, to those whose hearts were further hardened after Allah's admonition. Such are indeed in obvious error"
  39,23,"Allah has revealed the best teaching, a self-consistent Book which repeats its contents in manifold forms whereat shiver the skins of those that hold their Lord in awe, and then their skins and their hearts soften for Allah's remembrance. That is Allah's Guidance wherewith He guides whosoever He pleases. And he whom Allah does not guide to the Right Path has none to guide him"

  39,25,Their predecessors gave the lie to the Truth and then chastisement came upon them from whence they could not imagine
  39,26,"So Allah made them taste degradation in the life of this world, and certainly the chastisement of the Hereafter will be much more grievous. Would that they knew"
  39,27,We have indeed propounded for mankind all kinds of parables in this Qur'an that they may take heed

  39,29,"Allah propounds a parable: there is a man whose ownership is shared by several quarrelsome masters, each pulling him to himself; and there is another who is exclusively owned by one man. Can the two be alike? All praise and thanks be to Allah. But most of them are unaware"
  39,30,"(O Prophet), you are destined to die and they too are destined to die"
  39,31,Then eventually all of you will contend before your Lord on the Day of Resurrection
