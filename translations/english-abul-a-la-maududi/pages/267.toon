  15,91,those who had split up their Qur'an into pieces
  15,92,"By your Lord, We will question them all"
  15,93,concerning what they have been doing
  15,94,"(O Prophet), proclaim what you are commanded, and pay no heed to those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity"
  15,95,Surely We suffice to deal with those who scoff at you
  15,96,those who set up another deity alongside Allah. They shall soon come to know
  15,97,We certainly know that their statements sorely grieve you
  15,98,When (you feel so) glorify your Lord with His praise and prostrate yourself before Him
  15,99,and worship your Lord until the last moment (of your life) that will most certainly come
  16,1,"Allah's judgement has (all but) come; do not, then, call for its speedy advent. Holy is He, and far above their associating others with Him in His Divinity"
  16,2,"He sends down this spirit (of prophecy) by His command through His angels on any of His servants whom He wills, (directing them): \"Warn people that there is no deity but Me; so hold Me alone in fear"
  16,3,He created the heavens and the earth with Truth. Exalted is He above whatever they associate with Allah in His Divinity
  16,4,"He created man out of a mere drop of fluid, and lo! he turned into an open wrangler"

  16,6,And you find beauty in them as you drive them to pasture in the morning and as you drive them back home in the evening
