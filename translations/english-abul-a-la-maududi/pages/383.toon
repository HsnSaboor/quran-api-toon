quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  27,64,"Who is it Who creates in the first instance and then repeats it? Who is it Who provides you with sustenance from the heavens and the earth? Is there any god associated with Allah (in these tasks)? Say: \"Bring forth your evidence, if you are truthful"
  27,65,"Say: \"None in the heavens or on the earth has knowledge of the Unseen save Allah. They do not know when they will be raised to life"
  27,66,"Nay, but they have lost their knowledge of the Hereafter. They are steeped in doubt and uncertainty about it: rather they are blind to it"
  27,67,"The unbelievers say: \"When we become dust, we and our forefathers, shall we really be brought out (from our graves)"
  27,68,We were told about this and so were our forefathers before us. But these are no more than fairy tales that have been recounted from ancient times
  27,69,"Say: \"Go about through the earth and see what has been the end of the evil-doers"

  27,72,"Say: \"The chastisement whose hastening you have been asking for, maybe a part of it has drawn quite near to you"
  27,73,Indeed Your Lord is exceedingly bountiful to mankind. Yet most of them do not give thanks
  27,74,Verily your Lord knows all that their hearts conceal as well as all that they reveal
  27,75,There is nothing that is hidden - be it in the heaven or the earth - but is recorded in a Clear Book
  27,76,Surely this Qur'an explains to the Children of Israel most of the matters concerning which they have disagreements
