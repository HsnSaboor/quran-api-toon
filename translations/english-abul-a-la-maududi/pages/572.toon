quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  72,1,"Say, (O Prophet), it was revealed to me that a band of jinn attentively listened to (the recitation of the Qur'an) and then (went back to their people) and said"
  72,2,"“We have indeed heard a wonderful Qur'an which guides to the Right Way; so we have come to believe in it, and we will not associate aught with Our Lord in His Divinity”"
  72,3,and that “He – exalted be His Majesty – has not taken to Himself either a wife or a son”
  72,4,and that “the foolish among us have been wont to say outrageous things about Allah”
  72,5,and that “we had thought that men and jinn would never speak a lie about Allah”
  72,6,"and that “some from among the humans used to seek protection of some among the jinn, and thus they increased the arrogance of the jinn”"
  72,7,"and that “they thought, even as you thought, that Allah would never raise anyone (as a Messenger)”"
  72,8,"and that “we tried to pry (the secrets of) the heaven, but we found it full of terrible guards and shooting meteors”"
  72,9,and that “we would take up stations in the heaven to try to hear but anyone who now attempts to listen finds a shooting meteor in wait for him”
  72,10,"and that “we do not know whether evil is intended for those on the earth, or whether their Lord intends to direct them to the Right Way”"
  72,11,and that “some of us are upright and some of us are otherwise for we follow widely divergent paths”
  72,12,"and that “we thought that we will neither be able to frustrate Allah on earth, nor frustrate Him by flight”"
  72,13,and that “when we heard the teaching of the Right Way we came to believe in it; he who believes in His Lord shall have no fear of suffering loss or being subjected to any injustice”
