quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,Our command consists of only one Word which is carried out in the twinkling of an eye
  54,51,"We did indeed destroy many like you. Is there, then, any who will heed"
  54,52,All their deeds are recorded in the Scrolls
  54,53,"everything large or small, is duly inscribed"
  54,54,Surely those who shun disobedience will dwell amidst Gardens and running streams
  54,55,"where they will be honourably seated in the presence of a King, Mighty in Power"
  55,1,The Merciful One
  55,2,has taught the Qur'an
  55,3,has created man
  55,4,and has taught him articulate speech
  55,5,The sun and the moon follow a reckoning
  55,6,and the stars and the trees all prostrate themselves
  55,7,and He has raised up the heaven and has set a balance
  55,8,that you may not transgress in the balance
  55,9,but weigh things equitably and skimp not in the balance
  55,10,And He has set up the earth for all beings
  55,11,Therein are fruit and palm-trees with their dates in sheaths
  55,12,and a variety of corn with both husk and grain
  55,13,Which of the bounties of your Lord will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny
  55,14,"He has created man from dry, rotten clay like the potter's"
  55,15,and has created the jinn from the flame of fire
  55,16,Which of the wonders of your Lord's power will you twain – you men and jinn – then deny
