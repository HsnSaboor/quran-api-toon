quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,where none shall burn except the most wicked
  92,16,"who rejected the Truth, calling it falsehood and turned his back on it"
  92,17,But the God-fearing shall be kept away from it
  92,18,the Godfearing who spends his wealth to purify himself
  92,19,not as payment for any favours that he received
  92,20,but only to seek the good pleasure of his Lord Most High
  92,21,He will surely be well-pleased (with him)
  93,1,By the bright forenoon
  93,2,and by the night when it covers the world with peace
  93,3,"(O Prophet), your Lord has neither forsaken you, nor is He displeased"
  93,4,Indeed what is to come will be better for you than what has gone by
  93,5,Verily your Lord will soon give you so amply that you will be well-pleased
  93,6,Did He not find you an orphan and then gave you shelter
  93,7,"Did He not find you unaware of the Right Way, and then directed you to it"
  93,8,"And did He not find you in want, and then enriched you"
  93,9,"Therefore, be not harsh with the orphan"
  93,10,and chide not him who asks
  93,11,and proclaim the bounty of your Lord
  94,1,"(O Prophet), Did We not lay open your breast"
  94,2,and relieve you of the burden
  94,3,that had well-nigh broken your back
  94,4,And did We not exalt your fame
  94,5,"Indeed, there is ease with hardship"
  94,6,"Most certainly, there is ease with hardship"
  94,7,"So, whenever you are free, strive in devotion"
  94,8,and turn to your Lord with longing
