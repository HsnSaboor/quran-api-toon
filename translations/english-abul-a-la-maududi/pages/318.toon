  20,88,"and brought out of there (from the molten gold) the effigy of a calf that lowed.\" The people cried out: \"This is your deity and the deity of Moses, whom Moses has forgotten"
  20,89,"Did they not see that it did not return a word to them, and had no power either to hurt them or to cause them any benefit"
  20,90,"Certainly Aaron had said to them even before (the return of Moses): \"My people, you were fallen into error because of the calf. Surely your Lord is Most Compassionate; so follow me and obey my command"
  20,91,"But they answered: \"By no means shall we cease to worship it until Moses returns to us"
  20,92,"(After rebuking his people) Moses turned to Aaron and said: \"Aaron! What prevented you, when you saw them going astray"
  20,93,from following my way? Have you disobeyed my command
  20,94,"Aaron answered: \"Son of my mother! Do not seize me with my beard, nor by (the hair of) my head. I feared that on returning you might say: 'You sowed discord among the Children of Israel, and did not pay heed to my words"
  20,95,"Moses said: \"What, then, is your case, O Samiri"
  20,96,"He answered: \"I saw what the people did not see. So I took a handful of dust from the trail of the Messenger, and I flung it (into the fire). Thus did my mind prompt me"
  20,97,"Moses said: \"Be gone, then. All your life you shall cry: 'Untouchable.' There awaits a term for your reckoning that you cannot fail to keep. Now look at your god that you devotedly adored: We shall burn it and scatter its remains in the sea"
  20,98,"Your God is none else than Allah, beside Whom there is no god. His knowledge embraces everything"
