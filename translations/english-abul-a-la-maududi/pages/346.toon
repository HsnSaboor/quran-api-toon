quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,60,"who give, whatever they give in charity, with their hearts trembling at the thought that they are destined to return to their Lord"
  23,61,it is these who hasten to do good works and vie in so doing with one another
  23,62,We do not lay a burden on anyone beyond his capacity. We have a Book with Us that speaks the truth (about everyone); and they shall in no wise be wronged
  23,63,"Nay, their hearts are lost in ignorance of all this; and their deeds too vary from the way (mentioned above). They will persist in these deeds"
  23,64,until We seize with Our chastisement those of them that are given to luxuriant ways. They will then begin to groan
  23,65,Put a stop to your groaning now! Surely no help shall be provided to you from Us
  23,66,My Signs were rehearsed to you and you turned back on your heels and took to flight
  23,67,"behaving arrogantly, and making fun, and talking nonsense (about the Book in your nightly chats)"
  23,68,"Did they never ponder over this Word (of God)? Or has he (to wit, the Messenger) brought something the like of which did not come to their forefathers of yore"
  23,69,Or is it that they were unaware of their Messenger and were therefore repelled by him for he was a stranger to them
  23,70,"Or do they say that there is madness in him? Nay, he has brought them the Truth and it is the Truth that most of them disdain"
  23,71,"Were the Truth to follow their desires, the order of the heavens and the earth and those who dwell in them would have been ruined. Nay, the fact is that We have brought to them their own remembrance; and yet it is from their own remembrance that they are turning away"
  23,72,Are you asking them for something? What Allah has given you is the best. He is the Best of providers
  23,73,You are calling them to a Straight Way
  23,74,but those who do not believe in the Hereafter are ever prone to deviate from the Right Way
