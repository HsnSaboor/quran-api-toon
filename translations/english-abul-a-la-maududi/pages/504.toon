quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  46,15,"We have enjoined man to be kind to his parents. In pain did his mother bear him and in pain did she give birth to him. The carrying of the child to his weaning is a period of thirty months. And when he is grown to full maturity and reaches the age of forty, he prays: “My Lord, dispose me that I may give thanks for the bounty that You have bestowed upon me and my parents, and dispose me that I may do righteous deeds that would please You, and also make my descendants righteous. I repent to You, and I am one of those who surrender themselves to You.”"
  46,16,Such are those from whom We accept their best deeds and whose evil deeds We overlook. They will be among the people of Paradise in consonance with the true promise made to them
  46,17,"But he who says to his parents: “Fie on you! Do you threaten me that I shall be resurrected, although myriad generations have passed away before me (and not one of them was resurrected)?” The parents beseech Allah (and say to their child): “Woe to you, have faith. Surely Allah's promise is true.” But he says: “All this is nothing but fables of olden times.”"
  46,18,It is against such that Allah's sentence (of punishment) has become due. They will join the communities of humans and jinn that have preceded them. Verily all of them will court utter loss
  46,19,Of these all have ranks according to their deeds so that Allah may fully recompense them for their deeds. They shall not be wronged
  46,20,"And on the Day when the unbelievers will be exposed to the Fire, they will be told: “You have exhausted your share of the bounties in the life of the world, and you took your fill of enjoyments. So, degrading chastisement shall be yours on this Day for you waxed arrogant in the earth without justification and acted iniquitously.”"
