quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  17,50,"Tell them: \"(You will be raised afresh even if) you turn to stone or iron"
  17,51,"or any other form of creation you deem hardest of all (to recreate from).\" They will certainly ask: \"Who will bring us back (to life)?\" Say: \"He Who created you in the first instance.\" They will shake their heads at you and inquire: \"When will that be?\" Say: \"Perhaps that time might have drawn near"
  17,52,"on the Day when He will call you and you will rise praising Him in response to His call, and you will believe that you had lain in this state only for a while"
  17,53,"Tell My servants, (O Muhammad), to say always that which is best. Verily it is Satan who sows discord among people. Satan indeed is an open enemy to mankind"
  17,54,"Your Lord knows you best. He will have mercy on you if He wills and chastise you if He wills. We have not sent you, (O Muhammad), as an overseer over them"
  17,55,"Your Lord knows all who dwell in the heavens and the earth. We have exalted some Prophets over others, and We gave the Psalms to David"
  17,56,"Tell them: \"Call upon those whom you fancy to be (your helpers) instead of Him! They have no power to remove any affliction from you, nor can they shift it (to any other)"
  17,57,"Those whom they call upon are themselves seeking the means of access to their Lord, each trying to be nearer to Him. They crave for His Mercy and dread His chastisement. Surely your Lord's punishment is to be feared"
  17,58,There is not a town but We shall destroy it or upon which We shall inflict severe chastisement before the Day of Resurrection. This is written down in the Eternal Book (of Allah)
