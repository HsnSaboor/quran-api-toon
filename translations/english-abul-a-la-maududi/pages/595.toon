quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and its heat and brightness
  91,2,and by the moon as it follows it
  91,3,and by the day as it displays the sun's glory
  91,4,and by the night as it envelopes the sun
  91,5,and by the sky and by Him Who made it
  91,6,and by the earth and by Him Who stretched it out
  91,7,and by the soul and by Him Who perfectly proportioned it
  91,8,and imbued it with (the consciousness of) its evil and its piety
  91,9,He who purifies it will prosper
  91,10,and he who suppresses it will be ruined
  91,11,In their presumptuous insolence the Thamud called the Truth a lie
  91,12,when their arch-criminal rose up in rage
  91,13,"Then Allah's Messenger warned them: “Hands off the she-camel and her drink!”"
  91,14,"But they rejected his statement as a lie and hamstrung the she-camel. For that crime their Lord rumbled down upon them, utterly razing them to the ground"
  91,15,He has no fear of its sequel
  92,1,By the night when it enshrouds
  92,2,and by the day when it breaks in its glory
  92,3,and by Him Who created the male and the female
  92,4,surely your strivings are divergent
  92,5,As for him who gave out his wealth (for Allah's sake) and abstained (from disobeying Him)
  92,6,and affirmed the Truth of goodness
  92,7,We shall facilitate for him the Way to Bliss
  92,8,As for him who was a miser and behaved with aversion (to Allah)
  92,9,and denied the Truth of goodness
  92,10,We shall facilitate for him the way to Hardship
  92,11,and his wealth shall be of no avail to him when he perishes
  92,12,Surely it is for Us to show the Right Way
  92,13,and to Us belong the Next Life and the present
  92,14,I have now warned you of a Blazing Fire
