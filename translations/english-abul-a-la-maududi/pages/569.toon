quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,although they shall be within sight of one another. The guilty one would fain ransom himself from the torment of that Day by offering his children
  70,12,and his spouse and his brother
  70,13,and his kinsfolk who had stood by him
  70,14,"and all persons of the earth, if only he could thus save himself"
  70,15,By no means! It will be the fierce flame
  70,16,that will strip off the scalp
  70,17,It shall insistently summon him who turned his back and retreated
  70,18,and amassed wealth and covetously hoarded it
  70,19,Verily man is impatient by nature
  70,20,bewailing when evil befalls him
  70,21,and tight-fisted when good fortune visits him
  70,22,except those that pray
  70,23,and are constant in their Prayer
  70,24,and those in whose wealth there is a known right
  70,25,for those that ask and those that are dispossessed
  70,26,those who firmly believe in the Day of Recompense
  70,27,and fear the chastisement of their Lord –
  70,28,surely the chastisement of their Lord is a thing none can feel secure from –
  70,29,and those who guard their private parts
  70,30,"except in regard to their spouses and those whom their right hands possess, for in regard to them they are not reproachable"
  70,31,"but any who seeks to go beyond that, it is indeed they who are the transgressors"
  70,32,and those who fulfil their trusts and their covenants
  70,33,and those who are upright in their testimonies
  70,34,and who take due care of their Prayer
  70,35,all these shall live honourably in the Gardens
  70,36,But what is the matter with the unbelievers who are hurrying towards you
  70,37,"in crowds, both on the right and on the left"
  70,38,Does everyone of them wish to enter the Garden of Bliss
  70,39,By no means! They know that which We have created them from
