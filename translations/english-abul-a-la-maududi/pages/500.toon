quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  45,14,"(O Prophet), tell the believers to indulge those who have no fear of any evil days coming upon them from Allah so that Allah may Himself requite them for their deeds"
  45,15,"Whoever acts righteously, does so to his own good; and whoever commits an evil will suffer its consequence. All of you will then be sent back to your Lord"
  45,16,"Indeed We endowed the Children of Israel with the Book and Wisdom and Prophethood, and provided them with good things as sustenance, and exalted them above the peoples of the whole world"
  45,17,We gave them clear directions in matters pertaining to religion. Yet they differed among themselves (not out of ignorance but) after knowledge had come to them; and they did so out of the desire to commit excesses against one another. On the Day of Resurrection Allah will judge among them regarding what they had differed
  45,18,"And then We set you, (O Prophet), on a clear high road in religious matters. So follow that and do not follow the desires of those who do not know"
  45,19,"Surely they will be of no avail to you against Allah. Indeed the wrong-doers are friends of each other, whereas Allah is the friend of the God-fearing"
  45,20,These are the lights of discernment for people and guidance and mercy for those endowed with sure faith
  45,21,"Do the evil-doers imagine that We shall make them equal to those who believe and do good, making their lives and deaths alike? How vile is their judgement"
  45,22,Allah created the heavens and the earth in Truth that each person may be requited for his deeds. They shall not be wronged
