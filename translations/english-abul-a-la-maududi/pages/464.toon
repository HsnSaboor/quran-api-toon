quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  39,48,"The evil consequences of their deeds will become fully apparent to them, and what they had scoffed at will encompass them"
  39,49,"When an affliction befalls man, he cries out to Us; but when We grant him a favour from Us, he says: “I have been granted this on account of my knowledge.” Nay; this (favour) is a test; but most of them do not know"
  39,50,"Their predecessors also said the same, but their earnings proved of no avail to them"
  39,51,and the evil consequences of their deeds overtook them. The wrongdoers among these will also be overtaken by the evil consequences of their deeds. They will be utterly unable to frustrate (Us)
  39,52,Do they not know that Allah enlarges and straitens the provision of whomsoever He pleases? Therein are Signs for those that believe
  39,53,"Tell them, (O Prophet): “My servants who have committed excesses against themselves, do not despair of Allah's Mercy. Surely Allah forgives all sins. He is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  39,54,Turn to your Lord and surrender yourselves to Him before the chastisement over-takes you; for then you will receive no help
  39,55,Follow the best of what has been revealed to you from your Lord before the chastisement suddenly comes upon you without you even being aware of it.”
  39,56,"Lest a person should say: “Alas for me for neglecting my duty towards Allah and for being among those that scoffed”"
