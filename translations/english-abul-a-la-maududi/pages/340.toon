quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,65,"Have you not seen how Allah has subjected to you all that is in the earth, and the vessels that sail in the sea by His command, and it is He Who holds back the sky that it may not fall on earth except by His leave? Surely Allah is Most Gentle, Ever Compassionate to people"
  22,66,"And it is He Who has endowed you with life and it is He who causes you to die, and it is He Who will then resurrect you. Man is indeed extremely prone to denying the Truth"
  22,67,"For every people We have prescribed a way of worship which they follow. So, (O Muhammad), let them not dispute with you concerning this, and call them to Your Lord. You are certainly on the Straight Way"
  22,68,"And if they dispute with you, say: \"Allah knows well what you do"
  22,69,Allah will judge among you on the Day of Resurrection concerning matters about which you disagreed
  22,70,Are you not aware that Allah knows all that is in the heaven and the earth? Surely it is all preserved in a Book. Indeed that is easy with Allah
  22,71,Instead of Allah they worship those concerning whom He has revealed no sanction and concerning whom they have no true knowledge. None shall be able to help such evil-doers
  22,72,"When Our Signs are plainly recited to them, you will perceive utter repugnance on their faces and it all but seems as if they will soon pounce upon those who recite Our Signs to them. Say: \"Shall I tell you what is worse than that? The Fire with which Allah has threatened those who disbelieve. That is truly an evil end"
