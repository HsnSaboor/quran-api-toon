quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,28,"Keep yourself content with those who call upon their Lord, morning and evening, seeking His pleasure, and do not let your eyes pass beyond them. Do you seek the pomp and glitter of the world? Do not follow him whose heart We have caused to be heedless of Our remembrance, and who follows his desires, and whose attitude is of excess"
  18,29,"And proclaim: \"This is the Truth from your Lord. Now let him who will, believe; and let him who will, disbelieve. We have prepared a Fire for the wrong-doers whose billowing folds encompass them. If they ask for water, they will be served with a drink like dregs of oil that will scald their faces. How dreadful a drink, and how evil an abode"
  18,30,As for those who believe and do good We shall not cause their reward to be lost
  18,31,"They shall dwell in the Gardens of Eternity, beneath which streams flow. There they will be adorned with bracelets of gold, will be arrayed in green garments of silk and rich brocade, and will recline on raised couches. How excellent is their reward, and how nice their resting-place"
  18,32,"(O Muhammad), propound a parable to them. There were two men of whom We bestowed upon one of the two vineyards, surrounding both of them with date-palms and putting a tillage in between"
  18,33,Both the vineyards yielded abundant produce without failure and We caused a stream to flow in their midst
  18,34,"so the owner had fruit in abundance and he said to his neighbour, while conversing with him: \"I have greater wealth than you and I am stronger than you in numbers"
