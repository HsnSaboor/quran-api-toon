quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,25,How is it that you are not helping one another
  37,26,"Indeed, today they are surrendering themselves completely.”"
  37,27,They will then turn towards each other (and start wrangling)
  37,28,"(The followers will say to their leaders): “You used to come to us from the right hand.”"
  37,29,"They will say: “Nay, you yourselves were not the ones who would believe"
  37,30,We had no power over you. You were a rebellious people
  37,31,and so we became deserving of the Word of our Lord that we shall be made to suffer chastisement
  37,32,So we led you astray; we ourselves were strayed.”
  37,33,"On that Day, they will all share the chastisement"
  37,34,Thus do We treat the culprits
  37,35,"Whenever it was said to them: “There is no true deity apart from Allah,” they waxed proud"
  37,36,"and said: “Shall we forsake our deities for the sake of a distracted poet?”"
  37,37,(They say so although) he brought the Truth and confirmed the veracity of the Messengers
  37,38,"(They will be told): “You shall taste the grievous chastisement"
  37,39,You will only be recompensed according to your deeds.”
  37,40,But Allah's chosen servants (shall be spared this woeful end)
  37,41,For them awaits a known provision
  37,42,a variety of delicious fruits; and they shall be honoured
  37,43,in the Gardens of Bliss
  37,44,They will be seated upon couches set face to face
  37,45,"a cup filled with wine from its springs, will be passed around to them"
  37,46,"white, sparkling (wine), a delight to the drinkers"
  37,47,There will neither be any harm in it for their body nor will it intoxicate their mind
  37,48,"Theirs shall be wide-eyed maidens with bashful, restrained glances"
  37,49,so delicate as the hidden peel under an egg's shell
  37,50,"Then some of them will turn to others, and will ask each other"
  37,51,"One of them will say: “I had a companion in the world"
