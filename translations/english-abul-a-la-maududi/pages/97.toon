quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"Most of their secret conferrings are devoid of good, unless one secretly enjoins in charity, good deeds, and setting the affairs of men right. We shall grant who ever does that seeking to please Allah a great reward"
  4,115,"As for him who sets himself against the Messenger and follows a path other than that of the believers even after true guidance had become clear to him, We will let him go to the way he has turned to, and We will cast him into Hell - an evil destination"
  4,116,"Truly it is only associating others with Allah in His divinity that Allah does not forgive, and forgives anything besides that to whomsoever He wills. Whoever associates others with Allah in His divinity has indeed strayed far away"
  4,117,"Rather than call upon Him, they call upon goddesses, and call upon a rebellious Satan"
  4,118,"upon whom Allah has laid His curse. He said (to Allah): 'I will take to myself an appointed portion of Your servants"
  4,119,"and shall lead them astray, and shall engross them in vain desires, and I shall command them and they will cut off the ears of the cattle, and I shall command them and they will disfigure Allah's creation.' He who took Satan rather than Allah for his guardian has indeed suffered a man-ifest loss"
  4,120,"Satan makes promises to them and fills them with vain hopes, but whatever he promises them is merely delusion"
  4,121,"For these people, their abode shall be Hell and from there they shall find no way of escape"
