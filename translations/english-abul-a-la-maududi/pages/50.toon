quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,1,"Alif, Lam, Mim"
  3,2,"Allah, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, Who sustains the entire order of the universe - there is no God but He"
  3,3,"He has revealed this Book to you, setting forth the truth and confirming the earlier Books, and earlier He revealed the Torah and Gospel"
  3,4,for the guidance of mankind; and He has also revealed the Criterion (to distinguish truth from falsehood). A severe chastisement lies in store for those who deny the signs of Allah. Allah is All-Mighty; He is the Lord of Retribution
  3,5,Nothing in the earth and in the heavens is hidden from Allah
  3,6,"It is He Who fashions you in the wombs as He wills. There is no God but He; the All-Mighty, the All-Wise"
  3,7,"It is He Who has revealed the Book to you. Some of its verses are absolutely clear and lucid, and these are the core of the Book. Others are ambiguous. Those in whose hearts there is perversity, always go about the part which is ambiguous, seeking mischief and seeking to arrive at its meaning arbitrarily, although none knows their true meaning except Allah. On the contrary, those firmly rooted in knowledge say: 'We believe in it; it is all from our Lord alone.' No one derives true admonition from anything except the men of understanding"
  3,8,"They pray to Allah: 'Our Lord! Do not let our hearts swerve towards crookedness after You have guided us to the right way, and. bestow upon us Your mercy. Surely You, only You, are the Munificent Giver"
  3,9,"Our Lord! You surely will gather mankind together one Day, a Day about (the coming of which) there is no doubt. Surely Allah never goes against His promise"
