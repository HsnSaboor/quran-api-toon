quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,60,"(O Messenger!) Have you not seen those who claim to believe in the Book which has been revealed to you and in the Books revealed before you, and yet desire to submit their disputes to the judgement of taghut (the Satanic authorities who decide independently of the Law of Allah), whereas they had been asked to reject it. And Satan seeks to make them drift far away from the right way"
  4,61,"When they are told: 'Come to that which Allah has revealed, and come to the Messenger', you will notice the hypocrites turning away from you in aversion"
  4,62,"But what happens when some misfortune visits them because of their own misdeeds? Then, they come to you swearing by Allah, saying: 'We wanted nothing but to do good and to bring about conciliation (between the two parties)"
  4,63,"As for them, Allah knows what is in their hearts. Leave them alone, admonish them, and say to them penetrating words about themselves"
  4,64,"(And tell them that) We never sent a Messenger but that he should be obeyed by the leave of Allah. If whenever they wronged themselves they had come to you praying to Allah for forgiveness, and had the Messenger prayed for their forgiveness, they would indeed have found Allah All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate"
  4,65,"But no, by your Lord, they cannot become true be-lievers until they seek your arbitration in all matters on which they disagree among themselves, and then find not the least vexation in their hearts over what you have decided, and accept it in willing submission"
