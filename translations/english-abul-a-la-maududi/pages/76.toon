quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,195,"Their Lord answered the Prayer thus: \"I will not suffer the work of any of you, whether male or female, to go to waste; each of you is from the other. Those who emigrated and were driven out from their homesteads and were persecuted in My cause, and who fought and were slain, indeed I shall wipe out their evil deeds from them and shall certainly admit them to the gardens beneath which rivers flow.\" This is their reward with their Lord; and with Allah lies the best reward"
  3,196,(O Messenger!) Do not let the strutting about of the unbelievers in the land deceive you
  3,197,"This is but a little enjoyment, then their destination is Hell -what an evil resting place"
  3,198,"But those who fear their Lord: theirs shall be the gardens beneath which rivers flow and in which they will live forever: a hospitality from Allah Himself, And Allah's reward is best for the truly pious"
  3,199,"And among the People of the Book some believe in Allah and what has been revealed to you, and what has been revealed to them. They humble themselves before Allah, and do not sell Allah's revelations for a small price. For these men their reward is with their Lord. Allah is swift in His reckoning"
  3,200,"Believers, be steadfast, and vie in steadfastness, stand firm in your faith, and hold Allah in fear that you may attain true success"
