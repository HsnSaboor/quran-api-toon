quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,Those who do not believe in the Hereafter give angels the names of females
  53,28,although they have no knowledge regarding that. They only follow their conjecture and conjecture can never take the place of the Truth
  53,29,So leave alone those who turn away from the remembrance of Us and who seek nothing but the life of the world –
  53,30,that being the utmost of their knowledge. Surely your Lord fully knows those who have strayed away from His Path and He also fully knows those who are rightly guided
  53,31,To Allah alone belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. He will requite the evil-doers for their deeds and bestow a goodly reward on those who have done good
  53,32,"on those who avoid grave sins and shameful deeds, even if they may sometimes stumble into lesser offences. Surely your Lord is abounding in His Forgiveness. Very well is He aware of you since He produced you from the earth, and while you were still in your mothers' wombs and not yet born. So do not boastfully claim yourselves to be purified. He fully knows those that are truly Godfearing"
  53,33,"(O Prophet), did you see him who turned away (from the Path of Allah)"
  53,34,"who gave a little, and then stopped"
  53,35,"Does he have any knowledge of the world beyond the ken of sense-perception, and therefore, clearly sees (the Truth)"
  53,36,Has he not been informed of what is in the Scrolls of Moses
  53,37,"and of Abraham, who lived up to the trust"
  53,38,“That no bearer of a burden shall bear the burden of another
  53,39,and that man shall have nothing but what he has striven for
  53,40,and that (the result of) his striving shall soon be seen
  53,41,and that he shall then be fully recompensed
  53,42,and that the final end is with your Lord
  53,43,and that He it is Who causes people to laugh and to cry
  53,44,and that He it is Who causes death and grants life
