quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  19,65,"He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is in between. Serve Him, then, and be constant in serving Him. Do you know anyone that might be His compeer"
  19,66,"Man is prone to say: \"Shall I be raised to life after I die"
  19,67,Does man not remember that We created him before when he was nothing
  19,68,"By your Lord, We will surely muster them and the devils together. Then We will surely bring them all, on their knees, around Hell"
  19,69,and then We will draw aside from each party those who were most rebellious against the Most Compassionate Lord
  19,70,and then We shall know well all those most worthy to be cast in Hell
  19,71,There is not one of you but shall pass by Hell. This is a decree which your Lord will fulfil
  19,72,Then We shall deliver those that feared Allah and leave the wrong-doers there on their knees
  19,73,"When Our clear revelations are recited to those who deny the Truth they are wont to say to those who have faith: \"Which of the two groups has a better status and whose assemblies are grander"
  19,74,How numerous are the peoples We destroyed before them - those that were more resourceful and grander in outward appearance
  19,75,"Say: \"The Most Compassionate Lord grants respite to those who stray into error, until they behold what they had been threatened with, either God's chastisement (in the world) or the Hour (of Resurrection)\" - then they fully know whose station is worse, and who is weaker in hosts"
  19,76,"(On the contrary), Allah increases in guidance those who follow the Right Way. Lasting acts of righteousness are better in the sight of your Lord as reward and conducive to a better end"
