quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  13,19,"He who knows that the Book which has been sent to you from your Lord is the Truth, is he like him who is blind to that truth? It is only people of understanding who take heed"
  13,20,those who fulfil their covenant with Allah and do not break their compact after firmly confirming it
  13,21,who join together the ties which Allah has bidden to be joined; who fear their Lord and dread lest they are subjected to severe reckoning
  13,22,"who are steadfast in seeking the good pleasure of their Lord; who establish Prayer and spend both secretly and openly out of the wealth We have provided them, and who ward off evil with good. Theirs shall be the ultimate abode"
  13,23,"the Ever-lasting Gardens which they shall enter and so shall the righteous from among their fathers, and their spouses, and their offspring. And angels shall enter unto them from every gate, and say"
  13,24,"Peace be upon you. You merit this reward for your steadfastness.\" How excellent is the ultimate abode"
  13,25,"As for those who break the covenant of Allah after firmly confirming it, who cut asunder the ties that Allah has commanded to be joined, and who create corruption in the land: Allah's curse shall be upon them and theirs shall be a wretched abode (in the Hereafter)"
  13,26,"Allah grants the provision to whomsoever He wills abundantly and grants others in strict measure. They exult in the life of the world, although compared with the Hereafter, the life of the world is no more than temporary enjoyment"
  13,27,"Those who have rejected (the message of Muhammad) say: \"Why has no sign been sent down upon him from his Lord?\" Tell them: \"Allah lets go astray those whom He wills, and guides to Himself those who turn to Him"
  13,28,Such are the ones who believe (in the message of the Prophet) and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah. Surely in Allah's remembrance do hearts find rest
