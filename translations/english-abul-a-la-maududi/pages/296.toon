quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,21,"Thus did We make their case known to the people of the city so that they might know that Allah's promise is true, and that there is absolutely no doubt that the Hour will come to pass. But instead of giving thought to this, they disputed with one another concerning the People of the Cave, some saying: \"Build a wall over them. Their Lord alone knows best about them.\" But those who prevailed over their affairs said: \"We shall build a place of worship over them"
  18,22,"Some will say concerning them: \"They were three and their dog, the fourth\"; and some will say: \"They were five, and their dog, the sixth\" -- all this being merely guesswork; and still others will say: \"They were seven, and their dog, the eighth.\" Say: \"My Lord knows their number best. Only a few know their correct number. So do not dispute concerning their number, but stick to what is evident, and do not question anyone about them"
  18,23,"And never say about anything: \"I shall certainly do this tomorrow"
  18,24,"unless Allah should will it. And should you forget (and make such a statement), remember your Lord and say: \"I expect my Lord to guide me to what is nearer to rectitude than this"
  18,25,They remained in the Cave for three hundred years; and others added nine more years
  18,26,"Say: \"Allah knows best how long they remained in it, for only He knows all that is hidden in the heavens and the earth. How well He sees; how well He hears! The creatures have no other guardian than Him; He allows none to share His authority"
  18,27,"(O Prophet), recite to them from the Book of your Lord what has been revealed to you for none may change His words; (and were you to make any change in His words) you will find no refuge from Him"
