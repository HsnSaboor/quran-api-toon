quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,44,"(O Muhammad), you were then not on the western side when We bestowed this commandment (of Law), and you were not among its witnesses"
  28,45,Thereafter We raised up many a generation and a long time passed. You were then not even present among the people of Midian to rehearse Our verses to them. But it is We Who are sending news about that
  28,46,Nor were you on the side of the Mount (Sinai) when We called out to Moses (in the first instance). But it is out of Mercy from your Lord (that you are being informed of all this) so that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you. Maybe they will take heed
  28,47,"(We did so) lest a calamity might seize them because of the misdeeds they committed whereafter they would say: \"Our Lord, why did you not send a Messenger to us that we follow Your revelation and become among those who believe"
  28,48,"But when the Truth reached them from Us, they said: \"Why was he not given that which was given to Moses?\" But did they not reject before what had been given to Moses? They said: \"Both are magic, each supporting the other!\" And they said: \"We deny each of these"
  28,49,"Tell them, (O Prophet): \"Then do bring a Book from Allah which is a better guide than either of them, and I will follow it! Do so if you are truthful"
  28,50,"But if they do not hearken to this, know well that they only follow their lusts and who is in greater error than he who follows his lusts without any guidance from Allah? Allah does not guide those given to wrong-doing"
