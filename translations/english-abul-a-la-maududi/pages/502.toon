quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  45,33,(On that Day) the evil of their deeds will become apparent to them and what they had mocked at will encompass them
  45,34,"and it will be said: “We will forget you today as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours. The Fire shall now be your abode, and you shall have none to come to your aid"
  45,35,You reached this end because you made Allah's Signs an object of jest and the life of the world deluded you.” So they shall not be taken out of the Fire nor shall they be asked to make amends (and thus please their Lord)
  45,36,"So all praise be to Allah, the Lord of the heavens, the Lord of the earth, the Lord of the whole Universe"

  46,2,"The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the Most Mighty, the Most Wise"
  46,3,We have created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in Truth and for an appointed term. But those who disbelieve have turned away from what they were warned against
  46,4,"Tell them, (O Prophet): “Did you consider those whom you call upon beside Allah? Show me, which part of the earth they created? Or do they have any share in creating the heavens? Bring to me any Scripture earlier than this one, or any vestige of knowledge (in support of your belief) if you are truthful"
  46,5,"Who is farther strayed from the Right Path than he who calls upon others than Allah that cannot answer his call till the Day of Resurrection, the while they are not even conscious that callers are calling upon them"
