quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  5,96,"The game of the water and eating thereof are permitted to you as a provision for you (who are settled) and for those on a journey; but to hunt on land while you are in the state of Pilgrim sanctity is forbidden for you. Beware, then, of disobeying Allah to Whom you shall all be mustered"
  5,97,"Allah has appointed the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, as a means of support for (the collective life of) men, and has caused the holy month (of Pilgrimage), and the animals of sacrificial of-fering and their distinguishing collars to assist therein. This is so that you may know that Allah is aware of all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; and that Allah has knowledge of everything"
  5,98,"Know well that Allah is severe in retribution, and that Allah is also All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate"
  5,99,"The Messenger is bound only to deliver the message, whereafter Allah knows well all that you disclose and all that you conceal"
  5,100,"(O Messenger!) Say to them: \"The bad things and the good things are not equal, even though the abundance of the bad things might make you pleased with them. Men of understanding, beware of disobeying Allah; then maybe you will attain true success"
  5,101,"Believers! Do not ask of the things which, if made manifest to you, would vex you; for, if you should ask about them while the Qur'an is being revealed, they will be made manifest to you. Allah has pardoned whatever happened in the past. He is All-Forgiving, All-Forbearing"
  5,102,Indeed some people before you had asked such questions and in consequence fell into unbelief
  5,103,"Allah has neither appointed (cattle devoted to idols such as) Bahirah, Sa'ibah, Wasilah nor Ham; but those who disbelieve forge lies against Allah and of them most have no understanding (and therefore succumb to such superstitions)"
