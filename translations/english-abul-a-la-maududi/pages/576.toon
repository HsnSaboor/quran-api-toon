quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,He reflected and then hatched a scheme
  74,19,"Ruin seize him, how did he hatch a scheme"
  74,20,"Again, ruin seize him, how did he hatch a scheme"
  74,21,He looked (at others)
  74,22,then frowned and scowled
  74,23,then he retreated and waxed proud
  74,24,"and said: “This (Qur'an) is merely a sorcery of yore"
  74,25,this is nothing but the word of a mere mortal!”
  74,26,Him shall I soon roast in Hell
  74,27,And what do you know what Hell is
  74,28,It spares nothing; it leaves nothing intact
  74,29,it scorches (even) the skin
  74,30,Over it are nineteen keepers
  74,31,"We have appointed none but angels as the keepers of the Fire, and We have not made their number but as a trial for the unbelievers so that those who have been endowed with the Book will be convinced and the believers' faith will increase, and neither those who have been endowed with the Book nor the believers will fall into any doubt. As for those in whose hearts there is a sickness as well as the unbelievers, they will say: “What did Allah aim at by this strange parable?” Thus does Allah let whomsoever He pleases to go astray, and directs whomsoever He pleases to the Right Way. And none knows the hosts of your Lord but He. (And Hell has only been mentioned here) that people may take heed"
  74,32,"Nay, by the moon"
  74,33,and by the night when it recedes
  74,34,and by the day when it dawns (with its radiance)
  74,35,surely (Hell) is one of the greatest Signs
  74,36,a warning to humankind
  74,37,a warning to everyone of you whether he would like to come forward or lag behind
  74,38,Each one is a hostage to one's deeds
  74,39,save the People of the Right Hand
  74,40,"who shall be in the Gardens, and shall ask"
  74,41,about the guilty ones
  74,42,“What drove you to Hell?”
  74,43,"They will answer: “We were not among those who observed Prayer"
  74,44,and we did not feed the poor
  74,45,and we indulged in vain talk with those who indulged in vain talk
  74,46,and we gave the lie to the Day of Judgement
  74,47,until the inevitable event overtook us.”
