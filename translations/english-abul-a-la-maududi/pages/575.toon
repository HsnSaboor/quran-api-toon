quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"(O Prophet), your Lord knows that you sometimes stand up in Prayer nearly two-thirds of the night, and sometimes half or one-third of it, and so does a party of those with you; Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you cannot keep an accurate count of it, so He has shown mercy to you. So now recite as much of the Qur'an as you can. He knows that there are among you those who are sick and others who are journeying in the land in quest of Allah's bounty, and still others who are fighting in the cause of Allah. So recite as much of the Qur'an as you easily can, and establish Prayer, and pay Zakah, and give Allah a goodly loan. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you shall find it with Allah. That is better and its reward is greater. And ask for Allah's forgiveness; surely He is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate"
  74,1,O you enveloped in your cloak
  74,2,"Arise, and warn"
  74,3,and magnify the glory of your Lord
  74,4,and purify your robes
  74,5,and shun uncleanness
  74,6,and bestow not favour in order to seek from others a greater return
  74,7,and persevere for your Lord's sake
  74,8,When the Trumpet shall be sounded
  74,9,that will surely be a hard day
  74,10,not an easy day for the unbelievers
  74,11,Leave Me with him whom I alone have created
  74,12,whom I have endowed with abundant riches
  74,13,and sons ever present with him
  74,14,and for whom I have smoothed the way (to power and riches)
  74,15,and who still greedily desires that I should bestow upon him more
  74,16,By no means; he is stubbornly opposed to Our Signs
  74,17,I shall soon constrain him to a hard ascent
