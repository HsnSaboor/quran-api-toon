  30,6,This is Allah's promise and He does not go back on His promise. But most people do not know
  30,7,People simply know the outward aspect of the worldly life but are utterly heedless of the Hereafter
  30,8,Do they not reflect on themselves? Allah created the heavens and the earth and whatever lies between them in Truth and for an appointed term. Yet many people deny that they will meet their Lord
  30,9,"Have they not travelled through the earth that they may observe what was the end of their predecessors who were far mightier and tilled the land and built upon it more than these have ever built? And Allah's Messengers came to them with Clear Signs. It was not Allah Who wronged them, but it is they who wronged themselves"
  30,10,"Evil was the end of those evil-doers, for they gave the lie to Allah's Signs and scoffed at them"
  30,11,Allah creates in the first instance and will later repeat it. Thereafter it is to Him that you shall be sent back
  30,12,"On that Day when the Hour will come to pass, the criminals shall be dumbfounded"
  30,13,"None whom they had associated with Allah in His Divinity will intercede on their behalf; rather, they will disown those whom they had set up as Allah's associates in His Divinity"
  30,14,"On that Day when the Hour will come to pass, people will be split into groups"
  30,15,Then those who believed and acted righteously will be placed in a Garden and will be happy and jubilant
