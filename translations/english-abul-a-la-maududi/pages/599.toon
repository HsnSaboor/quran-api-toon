quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  98,8,"Their recompense lies with their Lord: Gardens of eternity beneath which rivers flow; therein they shall dwell, forever and ever. Allah is well-pleased with them, and they are well-pleased with Him. All this is for him who fears his Lord"
  99,1,When the earth will be shaken with a mighty shaking
  99,2,and the earth will throw up all her burdens
  99,3,"and man will cry out: “What is the matter with her?”"
  99,4,On that Day it will relate all her news
  99,5,for your Lord will have commanded her (to do so)
  99,6,On that Day people will go forth in varying states so that they be shown their deeds
  99,7,"So, whoever does an atom's weight of good shall see it"
  99,8,and whoever does an atom's weight of evil shall see it
  100,1,By (the horses) that charge snorting
  100,2,then raise sparks of fire (by their hoofs)
  100,3,then raid by the dawn
  100,4,and blaze a trail of dust
  100,5,and penetrate deep into a host
  100,6,Verily man is most ungrateful to his Lord
  100,7,and he himself is a witness to that
  100,8,and surely he loves riches with a passionate loving
  100,9,Is he not aware that when whatever lies (buried) in the graves is overthrown
