quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  67,1,"Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion of the Universe, and Who has power over everything"
  67,2,"Who created death and life that He might try you as to which of you is better in deed. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Forgiving"
  67,3,"Who created the seven heavens one upon another. You will see no incongruity in the Merciful One's creation. Turn your vision again, can you see any flaw"
  67,4,"Then turn your vision again, and then again; in the end your vision will come back to you, worn out and frustrated"
  67,5,"We have adorned the lower heaven with lamps, and have made them a means to drive away the satans. We have prepared for them the chastisement of the Blazing Fire"
  67,6,The chastisement of Hell awaits those who disbelieve in their Lord. What a wretched destination
  67,7,"When they will be cast into it, they will hear it roar as it boils"
  67,8,"as though it will burst with rage. Every time a multitude is cast into it, its keepers will ask them: “Did no warner come to you?”"
  67,9,"They will say: “Yes, a warner came to us, but we gave the lie to him and said: 'Allah has revealed nothing. You are surely in huge error"
  67,10,"They will say: 'If we had only listened and understood, we would not be among the inmates of the Blazing Fire.'”"
  67,11,Thus will they confess their sins. Damned are these inmates of the Blazing Fire
  67,12,Surely forgiveness and a mighty reward await those who fear Allah without seeing Him
