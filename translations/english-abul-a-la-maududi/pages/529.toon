quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  54,7,"with down-cast eyes they shall go forth from their graves, as though they were scattered locusts"
  54,8,"They shall be hurrying forth towards the caller, and the unbelievers (who had once denied this Day), will say: “This is a woeful Day.”"
  54,9,"Before them Noah's people also gave the lie (to his Message). They rejected Our servant as a liar, saying: “He is a madman”; and he was rebuffed"
  54,10,"Then he called upon His Lord: “Verily I am vanquished; so come You to my aid.”"
  54,11,Thereupon We opened the gates of the sky for water to pour down
  54,12,"and We made the earth burst forth with springs, and all this water converged to fulfil that which had been decreed"
  54,13,And We bore Noah on the vessel built of planks and nails
  54,14,"which sailed on under Our supervision: a reward for him who had been shown ingratitude"
  54,15,"And We left the Ark as a Sign. Is there, then, any who will take heed"
  54,16,So how awesome were My chastisement and My warnings
  54,17,"We have made this Qur'an easy as a reminder. Is there, then, any who will take heed"
  54,18,Ad also gave the lie (to Hud). So how awesome were My chastisement and My warnings
  54,19,We sent a tumultuous wind against them on a day of unremitting misfortune
  54,20,which tore people away and hurled them as though they were trunks of uprooted palm-trees
  54,21,So how awesome were My chastisement and My warnings
  54,22,"We have made the Qur'an easy to derive lessons from. Is there, then, any who will take heed"
  54,23,Thamud gave the lie to the warnings
  54,24,"saying: “Are we to follow a single mortal, one from among ourselves? If we do that, we shall surely be in error and folly"
  54,25,Was there none but he to whom the Reminder could be vouchsafed excluding all others? Nay; he is an insolent liar.”
  54,26,"(We told Our Messenger): “Tomorrow they shall know who is the insolent liar"
  54,27,We shall send the she-camel as a trial for them; so watch their end with patience
