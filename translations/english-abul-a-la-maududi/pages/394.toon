quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,71,"(O Prophet), tell them: \"Did you consider: if Allah were to make the night perpetual over you till the Day of Judgement, is there a god other than Allah who can bring forth light for you? Do you not hear"
  28,72,"Say: \"Did you consider: if Allah were to make the day become perpetual over you till the Day of Judgement, is there a god other than Allah who can bring in night for you that you may repose in it? Will you not see"
  28,73,It is out of His Mercy that He has made for you night and day that you may repose (during the night) and seek His Bounty (during the day) that you might be grateful
  28,74,"(Let them bear in mind) that on that Day when He will call out to them saying: \"Where are My associates, those whom you imagined to be so"
  28,75,"And from each people We shall draw a witness, and shall say to them: \"Do produce your evidence now.\" Then they shall know that the Truth is with Allah alone, and the lies which they had invented will forsake them"
  28,76,"To be sure, Qarun (Korah) was one of Moses' people; then he transgressed against them. We had bestowed on him such treasure that their very keys would have been raised with difficulty by a whole group of strong people. Once when his people said to him: \"Do not exult, for Allah does not love those who exult (in their riches)"
  28,77,"Seek by means of the wealth that Allah has granted you the Abode of the Hereafter, but forget not your share in this world and do good as Allah has been good to you and do not strive to create mischief in the land, for Allah loves not those who create mischief"
