quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  12,23,"And it so happened that the lady in whose house Joseph was living, sought to tempt him to herself, and one day bolting the doors she said: \"Come on now!\" Joseph answered: \"May Allah grant me refuge! My Lord has provided an honourable abode for me (so how can I do something so evil)? Such wrong-doers never prosper"
  12,24,"And she advanced towards him, and had Joseph not perceived a sign from his Lord he too would have advanced towards her. Thus was Joseph shown a sign from his Lord that We might avert from him all evil and indecency, for indeed he was one of Our chosen servants"
  12,25,"Then both of them rushed to the door, each seeking to get ahead of the other, and she tore Joseph's shirt from behind. Then both of them found the husband of the lady at the door. Seeing him she said: \"What should be the punishment of him who has foul designs on your wife except that he should be imprisoned or subjected to painful chastisement"
  12,26,"Joseph said: \"It is she who was trying to tempt me to herself.\" And a witness belonging to her own household testified (on grounds of circumstantial evidence): \"If his shirt is torn from the front, then she is telling the truth and he is a liar"
  12,27,"But if his shirt is torn from behind, then she has lied, and he is truthful"
  12,28,"So when the husband saw Joseph's shirt torn from behind he exclaimed: \"Surely, this is one of the tricks of you women; your tricks are indeed great"
  12,29,"Joseph, disregard this. And you - woman - ask forgiveness for your sin, for indeed it is you who has been at fault"
  12,30,"And some ladies in the city began to say: \"The chief's wife, violently in love with her houseboy, is out to tempt him. We think she is clearly mistaken"
