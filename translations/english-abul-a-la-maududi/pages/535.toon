quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,immortal youths shall go about them
  56,18,with goblets and ewers and a cup filled with a drink drawn from a running spring
  56,19,a drink by which their minds will not be clouded nor will it cause drunkenness
  56,20,they will also go about them with the fruits of which they may choose
  56,21,and with the flesh of any fowl that they may desire to eat
  56,22,and there shall be wide-eyed maidens
  56,23,beautiful as pearls hidden in their shells
  56,24,All this shall be theirs as a reward for their deeds
  56,25,There they shall hear no idle talk nor any sinful speech
  56,26,All talk will be sound and upright
  56,27,"As for the People on the Right, how fortunate shall be the people on the Right"
  56,28,They shall be in the midst of thornless lote trees
  56,29,and flower-clad acacias
  56,30,and extended shade
  56,31,and gushing water
  56,32,and abundant fruit
  56,33,never-ending and unforbidden
  56,34,They shall be on upraised couches
  56,35,and their spouses We shall have brought them into being afresh
  56,36,and shall have made them virgins
  56,37,intensely loving and of matching age
  56,38,All this will be for the People on the Right
  56,39,a large throng from the ancients
  56,40,and also a large throng from those of later times
  56,41,"As for the People on the Left: how miserable will be the People on the Left"
  56,42,They will be in the midst of scorching wind and boiling water
  56,43,"and a shade of thick, pitch-black smoke"
  56,44,which will neither be cool nor soothing
  56,45,Surely they had lived before in luxury
  56,46,and had persisted in the Great Sin
  56,47,"They used to say: “What! Once we are dead and are reduced to dust and bones, shall we still be raised to a new life from the dead"
  56,48,(We) and our fore-fathers of yore?”
  56,49,"Tell them, (O Prophet): “The earlier ones and the later ones"
  56,50,shall all be brought together on an appointed Day
