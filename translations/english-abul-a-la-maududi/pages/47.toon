quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"But those who devour interest become like the one whom Satan has bewitched and maddened by his touch. They have been condemned to this condition because they say, \"Trade is just like interest\", whereas Allah has made trade lawful and interest unlawful. Henceforth, if one abstains from taking interest after receiving this admonition from his Lord, no legal action will be taken against him regarding the interest he had devoured before; his case shall ultimately go to Allah. But if one repeats the same crime after this,. he shall go to Hell, where he shall abide for ever"
  2,276,"Allah deprives interest of all blessing and develops charity; and Allah does not like an ungrateful, sinful person"
  2,277,"As to those who believe and do good deeds, establish the Salat and pay the Zakat, they will most surely have their reward with their Lord and they will have nothing to fear nor to grieve"
  2,278,"O Believers, fear Allah and give up that interest which is still due to you, if you are true Believers"
  2,279,"but if you do not do so, then you are warned of the declaration of war against you by Allah and His Messenger. If, however, you repent even now (and forego interest), you are entitled to your principal; do no wrong, and no wrong will be done to you"
  2,280,"If your debtor be in straitened circumstances, give him time till his monetary condition becomes better. But if you remit the debt by way of charity, it would be better for you, if you only knew it"
  2,281,"Guard against the disgrace and misery of the day when you shall return to Allah: there everyone shall be paid in full, for the good or evil one has earned and none shall be wronged"
