quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,and grant me an honourable reputation among posterity
  26,85,and make me of those who will inherit the Garden of Bliss
  26,86,and forgive my father for he is among those who strayed
  26,87,and disgrace me not on the Day when people will be raised to life
  26,88,"the Day when nothing will avail, neither wealth nor offspring"
  26,89,but only he that brings to Allah a sound heart will (attain to success)
  26,90,(On that Day) the Garden will be brought near to the God-fearing
  26,91,and the Fire will be uncovered for those who strayed
  26,92,"and they will be asked: \"Where are the gods that you worshipped"
  26,93,"beside Allah? Can they be of any help to you, or even be of any help to themselves"
  26,94,"Then the idols and those who strayed will be hurled into the Fire headlong, one upon another"
  26,95,"and so too the hosts of Iblis, all of them"
  26,96,There they will quarrel with one another and the erring ones will say (to their deities)
  26,97,"By Allah, we were surely in clear error"
  26,98,when we assigned to you a position equal to that of the Lord of the Universe
  26,99,It is none but those steeped in guilt who led us into this error
  26,100,and now we have none to intercede on our behalf
  26,101,nor do we have a truly sincere friend
  26,102,If only we could return we would be among the believers
  26,103,"Surely there is a Sign in this, but most of them would not believe"
  26,104,"Verily Your Lord is Immensely Mighty, Ever Compassionate"
  26,105,The people of Noah gave the lie to the Messengers
  26,106,"Recall when their brother Noah said to them: \"Do you have no fear"
  26,107,I am a trustworthy Messenger to you
  26,108,so fear Allah and obey me
  26,109,"I seek of you no reward for this: my reward is with none except the Lord of the Universe"
  26,110,So fear Allah and obey me
  26,111,"They answered: \"Shall we accept you even though it is the meanest of people who follow you"
