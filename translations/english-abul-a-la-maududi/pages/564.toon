quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  67,27,"When they will see it near at hand, the faces of all those who had denied it will be distraught, and then they will be told: “This is the doom which you used to ask for.”"
  67,28,"Say to them: “Did you ever consider: whether Allah destroys me and those that are with me, or shows mercy to us, who can protect the unbelievers from a grievous chastisement?”"
  67,29,"Say to them: “He is Merciful, and it is in Him that we believe, and it is in Him that we put all our trust. Soon will you know who is in manifest error.”"
  67,30,"Say to them: “Did you even consider: if all the water that you have (in the wells) were to sink down into the depths of the earth, who will produce for you clear, flowing water?”"
  68,1,Nun. By the pen and what the scribes write
  68,2,"By your Lord's Grace, you are not afflicted with madness"
  68,3,and surely yours shall be a never-ending reward
  68,4,and you are certainly on the most exalted standard of moral excellence
  68,5,"So you will soon see, and they too will see"
  68,6,which of you is afflicted with madness
  68,7,Surely your Lord knows well those who have strayed from His Way just as He knows well those who are on the Right Way
  68,8,"Do not, then, yield to those who reject the Truth, decrying it as false"
  68,9,they would wish you to be pliant so that they too may be pliant
  68,10,And do not yield to any contemptible swearer
  68,11,the fault-finder who goes around slandering
  68,12,"the hinderer of good, the transgressor, the sinful"
  68,13,"the coarse-grained, and above all mean and ignoble"
  68,14,(who so acts) simply because he has wealth and sons
  68,15,"and whenever Our verses are rehearsed to him, he says: “These are fairy- tales of times gone by.”"
