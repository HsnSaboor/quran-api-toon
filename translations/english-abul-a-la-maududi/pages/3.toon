  2,6,"As for those who have rejected (these things), it is all the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them: they are not going to believe"
  2,7,"Allah has sealed up their hearts and ears and a covering has fallen over their eyes, and they have incurred the severest punishment"
  2,8,"Then there are some who say, \"We believe in Allah and the Last Day\", whereas they do not believe at all"
  2,9,"They thus try to deceive Allah and the Believers, but they succeed in deceiving none except themselves and they realize it not"
  2,10,In their hearts is a disease which Allah has increased all the more and a painful doom is in store for them for the lie they utter
  2,11,"Whenever it is said to them, \"Spread not disorder on the earth\", their reply is, \"We only seek to put things aright"
  2,12,Beware! they do spread disorder but they realize it not
  2,13,"And when it is said to them, \"Believe sincerely as the other people have believed\", they reply, \"Should we believe as fools have believed?\" Beware! they themselves are the fools, but they know it not"
  2,14,"When they meet those who believe, they say, \"We, too, are believers\", but when they privily meet their evil geniuses, they say, \"Indeed we are with you: we are only mocking at these people"
  2,15,"(Little do they realize that) Allah is mocking at them. He gives them rope enough, and they wander on and on blindly in their mischief and rebellion"
  2,16,"These are the people who have bartered away Guidance for error, but this is a profitless bargain that they have made, and they are not at all on the right way"
