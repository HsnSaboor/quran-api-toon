quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,Another Sign for them is that We carried all their offspring in the laden vessel
  36,42,and then created for them other vessels like those on which they ride
  36,43,"Should We so wish, We can drown them, and there will be none to heed their cries of distress, nor will they be rescued"
  36,44,It is only Our Mercy (that rescues them) and enables enjoyment of life for a while
  36,45,"When it is said to such people: “Guard yourselves against what is ahead of you and what has preceded you that mercy be shown to you” (they pay scant heed to it)"
  36,46,"Never does any Sign of their Lord come to them, but they turn away from it"
  36,47,"And when it is said to them: “Spend (in the Way of Allah) out of the sustenance that Allah has provided you,” the unbelievers say to the believers: “Shall we feed him whom, Allah would have fed, had He so wished?” Say: “You are in evident error.”"
  36,48,"They say: “When will this threat (of Resurrection) come to pass? Tell us if indeed you are truthful.”"
  36,49,The Truth is that they are waiting for nothing but a mighty Blast to seize them the while they are disputing (in their worldly affairs)
  36,50,"and they will not even be able to make a testament, nor to return to their households"
  36,51,Then the Trumpet shall be blown and lo! they will come out of their graves and be on the move towards their Lord
  36,52,"(nervously) exclaiming. “Alas for us! Who roused us out of our sleeping-place?” “This is what the Merciful One had promised, and what (His) Messengers had said was true.”"
  36,53,"Then there will simply be one single Blast, and all will have gathered before Us"
  36,54,"Today no one shall suffer the least injustice, and you shall not be recompensed except according to your deeds"
