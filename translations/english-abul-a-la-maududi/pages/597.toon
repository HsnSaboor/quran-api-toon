quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the fig and the olive
  95,2,and by the Mount Sinai
  95,3,"and by this city (of Makkah), a haven of peace"
  95,4,surely We created man in the best mould
  95,5,then We reverted him to the lowest of the low
  95,6,except those who have faith and do righteous deeds. Theirs is a never ending reward
  95,7,"Who, then, can give the lie to you, (O Prophet), about the Reward and the Punishment"
  95,8,Is not Allah the Greatest of all sovereigns
  96,1,Recite in the name of your Lord Who created
  96,2,created man from a clot of congealed blood
  96,3,"Recite: and your Lord is Most Generous"
  96,4,Who taught by the pen
  96,5,taught man what he did not know
  96,6,"Nay, surely man transgresses"
  96,7,for he believes himself to be self-sufficient
  96,8,Surely to your Lord is your return
  96,9,Did you see him who forbids
  96,10,a servant (of Allah) when he prays
  96,11,"Did you consider: what if he is on the Right Way"
  96,12,and enjoins piety
  96,13,"Did you consider: what if he gives the lie (to the Truth) and turns away (from it)"
  96,14,Does he not know that Allah sees everything
  96,15,"No indeed; if he does not desist, We shall drag him by the forelock"
  96,16,by the lying forelock steeped in sin
  96,17,So let him summon his helpmates
  96,18,We too shall summon the guards of Hell
  96,19,"No, not at all. Never obey him. But prostrate yourself and become nigh (to your Lord)"
