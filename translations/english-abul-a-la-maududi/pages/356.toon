  24,44,"He alternates the day and the night: there is indeed a lesson in it for those who have observing eyes"
  24,45,"And Allah created every creature from a sort of water: of them some one crawls upon its belly: another walks on two legs and still another on four; Allah creates whatever He wills for He has power over everything"
  24,46,"We have sent down Revelations that make the reality quite plain; however, Allah guides to the straight path whomsoever He pleases"
  24,47,"These people say \"We have believed in Allah and the Messenger and we have submitted\"; but soon after this, some of them turn away (from obedience): such people are not true Believers"
  24,48,"When they are called to Allah and His Messenger so that the Messenger may judge between them, a party of them turns away"
  24,49,"However, if the truth be on their side, they come towards the Messenger in all obedience"
  24,50,"Are their hearts afflicted with the disease (of hypocrisy)? Or, are they in doubt? Or, do they fear that Allah and His Messenger will be unjust to them? In fact, they themselves are unjust"
  24,51,"As regards the Believers, when they are called towards Allah and His Messenger so that the Messenger may judge between them, they say, \"We have heard and obeyed\"; such are the people who attain true success"

  24,53,"They (the hypocrites) solemnly swear by Allah and say, \"If you order us, we will leave our homes.\" Say to them, \"Do not swear oaths for your `obedience' is well known; Allah is fully aware of what you are doing"
