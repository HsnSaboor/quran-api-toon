quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,102,"Such is Allah, your Lord. There is no god but He - the Creator of all things. Serve Him alone - for it is He Who is the guardian of everything"
  6,103,"No visual perception can encompass Him, even though He encompasses all visual perception. He is the All-Subtle, the All-Aware"
  6,104,"The lights of clear perception have now come to you from your Lord. Then, he who chooses to see clearly, does so for his own good; and he who chooses to remain blind, does so to his own harm. I am not your keeper"
  6,105,"Thus do We make Our signs clear in diverse ways that they might say: 'You have learned this (from somebody)'; and 'We do this in order that We make the Truth clear to the people of knowledge"
  6,106,"(O Muhammad!) Follow the revelation which has come to you from your Lord, other than Whom there is no god, and turn away from those who associate others with Allah in His divinity"
  6,107,"Had Allah so willed they would not have associated others with Him in His divinity; and We have not appointed you a watcher over them, and you are not their guardian"
  6,108,"Do not revile those whom they invoke other than Allah, because they will revile Allah in ignorance out of spite. For We have indeed made the deeds of every people seem fair to them. Tlen, their return is to their Lord and He will inform them of what they have done"
  6,109,"They swear by Allah with their most solemn oaths that if a sign comes to them, they will certainly believe in it. Say: 'Signs are in Allah's power alone. What will make you realize that even if those signs were to come, they would still not believe"
  6,110,We are turning their hearts and eyes away from the Truth even as they did not believe in the first instance - and We leave them in their insurgence to stumble blindly
