  89,25,Then on that Day Allah will chastise as none other can chastise
  89,26,and Allah will bind as none other can bind
  89,27,"(On the other hand it will be said): “O serene soul"
  89,28,"Return to your Lord well-pleased (with your blissful destination), well-pleasing (to your Lord)"
  89,29,So enter among My (righteous) servants
  89,30,and enter My Paradise.”

  90,6,"He says: “I have squandered enormous wealth.”"
  90,7,Does he believe that none has seen him
  90,8,Did We not grant him two eyes
  90,9,and a tongue and two lips
  90,10,And did We not show him the two highroads (of good and evil)
  90,11,But he did not venture to scale the difficult steep
  90,12,And what do you know what that difficult steep is
  90,13,It is freeing someone's neck from slavery
  90,14,or giving food on a day of hunger
  90,15,to an orphan near of kin
  90,16,or to a destitute lying in dust
  90,17,"and, then besides this, he be one of those who believed, and enjoined upon one another steadfastness and enjoined upon one another compassion"
  90,18,These are the People of the Right Hand
  90,19,"As for those who rejected Our Signs, they are the People of the Left Hand"
  90,20,Upon them shall be a Fire that will hem them in
