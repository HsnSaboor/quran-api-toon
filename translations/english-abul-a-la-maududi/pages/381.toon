quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  27,45,"And We sent to Thamud their brother Salih (with the Message): \"Serve Allah,\" but all of a sudden they became split into two quarrelling factions"
  27,46,"Salih said: \"My people, why do you wish to hasten that evil rather than good should come upon you? Why should you not seek pardon from Allah so that mercy be shown to you"
  27,47,"They said: \"We augur ill of you and those who are with you.\" Salih replied: \"Your augury is with Allah. The truth is that you are a people who are being tried"
  27,48,Now there were nine ring-leaders in the city who created corruption in the land and never worked to set things right
  27,49,"They said: \"Swear to one another in the name of Allah that we shall make a sudden night swoop on Salih and his family and will then tell their heirs that we did not witness the destruction of his family. We are indeed truthful"
  27,50,"Thus they planned and We too planned, the while they did not know"
  27,51,"So see what was the outcome of the plan they made: We utterly destroyed them and their people, all of them"
  27,52,Now behold their houses that lie in utter ruins because of their wrong-doing. Verily there is a Sign in this for the people who know
  27,53,And We delivered those who believed and were wont to avoid disobeying (Allah)
  27,54,"We also sent Lot, and recall when he told his people: \"Do you commit shameless acts with your eyes open"
  27,55,"Do you lustfully approach men instead of women? Nay, you engage in acts of sheer ignorance"
