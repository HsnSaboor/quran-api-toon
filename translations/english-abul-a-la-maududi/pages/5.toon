quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,25,"And give good news (O Muhammad), to those who believe in this Book and do good deeds (in accordance with its teachings). For them there will be gardens underneath which canals flow. Their fruits will so resemble the fruits on the Earth that every time they will be provided with fruits, they will say, \"Such fruits were provided to us before on the Earth. \" And there will be pure spouses for them and therein they will live for ever"
  2,26,"Well, Allah is not ashamed to cite the similitude of a gnat or of something even more insignificant than this. As for those who believe, they come to know from the same similitude that it is the Revelation from their Lord; but those who disbelieve, say, \"What does Allah mean by such similitudes?\" Allah leads astray many and guides many to the right way by the same thing. And He leads astray only those who disobey Allah"
  2,27,"who break Allah's covenant after ratifying it; who cut asunder what Allah has ordered to be joined, and who produce chaos on the Earth. These are the people who are indeed the losers"
  2,28,"How is it that you adopt the attitude of disbelief towards Allah when the fact is that you were lifeless and He gave you life, and He will take away life from you and will again restore you to life: then you shall ultimately return to Him"
  2,29,He it is Who created for you all that there is on the Earth; He then turned to the sky and ordered it into seven heavens. And He has full knowledge of everything
