quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,97,"Whomsoever Allah guides is rightly guided; and whomsoever Allah lets go astray, you shall find none - apart from Him - who could protect him. We shall muster them all on the Day of Resurrection, on their faces - blind and dumb and deaf. Hell shall be their refuge. Every time its Fire subsides, We will intensify for them its flame"
  17,98,"That will be their recompense because they disbelieved in Our Signs and said: \"What, when we shall be reduced to bones and particles (of dust), shall we be raised again as a new creation"
  17,99,"Have they not perceived that Allah, Who has created the heavens and the earth, has the power to create the like of them? He has fixed a term for them about which there is no doubt. And yet the wrong-doers obstinately persist in unbelief"
  17,100,"Tell them, (O Prophet): \"Even if you owned the treasures of my Lord's Mercy you would have held them back for fear of spending them.\" Man is indeed ever niggardly"
  17,101,"We granted Moses nine clear signs. Ask the Children of Israel about that: when these signs came forth, Pharaoh said to him: \"Moses, I think that you are bewitched"
  17,102,"Moses replied: \"You know well that no one but the Lord of the heavens and the earth has sent these as eye-opening proofs. I truly think, O Pharaoh, that you are indeed doomed"
  17,103,"At last Pharaoh decided to uproot Moses and the Children of Israel from the land, but We drowned him together with all who were with him"
  17,104,"and thereafter We said to the Children of Israel: \"Now dwell in the land, but when the promised time of the Hereafter comes, We shall bring you all together"
