quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  18,5,"a thing about which they have no knowledge, neither they nor their ancestors. Dreadful is the word that comes out of their mouths. What they utter is merely a lie"
  18,6,"(O Muhammad), if they do not believe in this Message, you will perhaps torment yourself to death with grief, sorrowing over them"
  18,7,Surely We have made all that is on the earth an embellishment for it in order to test people as to who of them is better in conduct
  18,8,"In the ultimate, We shall reduce all that is on the earth to a barren plain"
  18,9,Do you think that the people of the Cave and the Inscription were one of Our wondrous signs
  18,10,"When those youths sought refuge in the Cave and said: \"Our Lord! Grant us mercy from Yourself and provide for us rectitude in our affairs"
  18,11,We lulled them to sleep in that cave for a number of years
  18,12,and then roused them so that We might see which of the two parties could best tell the length of their stay
  18,13,"We narrate to you their true story. They were a party of young men who had faith in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance"
  18,14,"and strengthened their hearts when they stood up and proclaimed: \"Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We shall call upon no other god beside Him; (for if we did so), we shall be uttering a blasphemy"
  18,15,"(Then they conferred among themselves and said): \"These men, our own people, have taken others as gods beside Him: why do they not bring any clear evidence that they indeed are gods? Who can be more unjust than he who foists a lie on Allah"
