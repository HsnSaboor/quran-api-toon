quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  13,43,"The unbelievers claim that you have not been sent by Allah. Tell them: \"Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you; and so also do those who know the Scriptures"
  14,1,"Alif. Lam. Ra'. This is a Book which We have revealed to you that you may bring forth mankind from every kind of darkness into light, and direct them, with the leave of their Lord, to the Way of the Mighty, the Innately Praiseworthy"
  14,2,(to the Way of) Allah to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Woe be to those who reject the Truth for a severe chastisement
  14,3,"to those who have chosen the life of the world in preference to the Hereafter, who hinder people from the Way of Allah, and seek to make it crooked. They have gone far astray"
  14,4,"Never have We sent a Messenger but he has addressed his people in their language that he may fully expound his Message to them. (And after the Message is expounded), Allah lets go astray whomsoever He wills, and guides to the Right Way whomsoever He wills. He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise"
  14,5,"We indeed sent Moses with Our Signs, saying: \"Lead your people out of all kinds of darkness into light, and admonish them by narrating to them anecdotes from the Days of Allah.\" Verily in it there are great Signs for everyone who is patient and gives thanks (to Allah)"
