quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  27,36,"Now, when (the envoy of the Queen) came to Solomon, he said: \"Do you want to aid me with wealth? Whatever Allah has granted me is much more than what He has given you. (Keep for yourselves) your gift in which you are exulting"
  27,37,"Envoy, go back to those who sent you and we shall certainly come upon them with hosts whom they will be unable to resist. We shall drive them out from there, and they will suffer humiliation and disgrace"
  27,38,"Solomon said: \"My nobles, which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission"
  27,39,"A stalwart of the jinn said: \"I will bring it to you before you rise from your council. Surely I have the power to do so and I am trustworthy"
  27,40,"And he who had some knowledge of the Book said: \"I will bring it before the twinkling of your eye.\" When Solomon saw the throne placed firmly beside him, he cried out: \"This is by the grace of my Lord so that He may test me whether I give thanks for (His Bounty) or act with ingratitude. Whoever is grateful is so to his own good; and whoever is ungrateful, let him know that my Lord is Immensely Resourceful, Most Bountiful"
  27,41,"Solomon said: \" Set the throne before her casually, and let us see whether she gets to the Truth or is one of those who are not guided to what is right"
  27,42,"When the Queen arrived, she was asked: \"Is your throne like this one?\" She said: \"It seems as if it is the same. We had already come to know this and we had submitted ourselves"
  27,43,"What prevented her (from accepting the True Faith) was her worshipping deities other than Allah, for she belonged to an unbelieving people"
  27,44,"She was told: \"Enter the palace.\" But when she saw it, she thought it was a pool of water and she bared both her calves (to enter into it). Solomon said: \"This is a slippery floor of crystal.\" Thereupon she cried out: \"My Lord, I have been inflicting much wrong on myself. Now I submit myself with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the whole Universe"
