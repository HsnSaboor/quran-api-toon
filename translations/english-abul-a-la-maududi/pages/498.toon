quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  44,40,The Day of Final Decision is the appointed time for all
  44,41,the Day when a friend shall be of no avail to his friend nor shall they be helped
  44,42,"except those to whom Allah shows mercy. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Compassionate"
  44,43,The tree of al-Zaqqum
  44,44,shall be the food of the sinful
  44,45,"Like dregs of oil, it will boil in their bellies"
  44,46,like boiling water
  44,47,“Seize him and drag him to the middle of the Blazing Fire
  44,48,then pour boiling water over his head as chastisement
  44,49,"Taste this, you are a person mighty and noble"
  44,50,This is what you used to doubt.”
  44,51,Verily the God-fearing shall be in a secure place
  44,52,amidst gardens and springs
  44,53,"Attired in silk and brocade, they shall be arrayed face to face"
  44,54,"Thus shall it be: and We shall espouse them to fair, wide-eyed maidens"
  44,55,"While resting in security, they shall call for all kinds of fruit"
  44,56,They shall not taste death except the death in this world. And Allah will save them from the chastisement of Hell
  44,57,as a favour from your Lord. That is the great triumph
  44,58,"(O Prophet), We have made this Book easy in your tongue so that they may take heed"
  44,59,"Wait, then; they too are waiting"
