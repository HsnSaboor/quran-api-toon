quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,41,"My people, how is it that I call you to salvation while you call me to the Fire"
  40,42,"you call me to deny Allah and to associate with Him as His partners those regarding whom I have no knowledge (that they are Allah's partners in His Divinity), whereas I call you to the Most Mighty, the Most Forgiving"
  40,43,"There is no doubt that those whom you call me to have no claim to be called upon in this world and in the Hereafter. Certainly to Allah shall be our return, and those who exceed the limits are destined to the Fire"
  40,44,Soon you shall remember what I say to you. I entrust my affairs to Allah. Surely Allah is watchful over His servants.”
  40,45,"Eventually Allah saved the person endowed with faith from all the evils of their guile, and a woeful chastisement encompassed the Pharaonites"
  40,46,"They are exposed to the Fire every morning and evening; and when the Last Hour will come to pass, a command shall be given: “Admit the Pharaonites to an even more severe chastisement.”"
  40,47,"Just imagine when they will remonstrate with one another in Hell. The weak ones will say to those who waxed proud: “We were your followers. Will you, then, lighten for us a part of our suffering of the Fire?”"
  40,48,"Those who had waxed proud will reply: “All of us are in it. Allah has already passed His judgement among His servants.”"
  40,49,"Those suffering in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell: “Call upon your Lord to lighten the chastisement for us just for a day.”"
