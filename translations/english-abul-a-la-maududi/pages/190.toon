quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  9,21,Their Lord gives them glad tidings of mercy from Him and of His good pleasure. For them await Gardens of eternal bliss
  9,22,Therein they shall abide forever. Surely with Allah a mighty reward awaits them
  9,23,"Believers, do not take your fathers and your brothers for your allies if they choose unbelief in preference to belief. Whosoever of you takes them as allies those are wrong-doers"
  9,24,"Tell them, (O Prophet): \"If your fathers and your sons and your brothers and your wives and your tribe and the riches you have acquired and the commerce of which you fear a slackening, and the dwellings that you love, if they are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger and striving in His cause, then wait until Allah brings about His decree. Allah does not guide the evil-doing folk"
  9,25,"Surely Allah has succoured you before on many a battlefield, and (you have yourselves witnessed His succour to you) on the day of Hunayn when your numbers made you proud, but they did you no good, and the earth, for all its vastness, constrained you, and you turned your backs in retreat"
  9,26,"Then Allah caused His tranquillity to descend upon His Messenger and upon the believers, and He sent down hosts whom you did not see, and chastised those who disbelieved. Such is the recompense of those who deny the Truth"
