quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  51,52,"Thus has it been (in the past): never did a Messenger come to the nations that preceded them but they said: “(He is) a sorcerer, or a mad-man.”"
  51,53,Have they arrived at a common understanding concerning this? No; but they are a people given to transgression
  51,54,So turn your attention away from them; you shall incur no blame
  51,55,"Do, however, keep exhorting them; for exhortation benefits those endowed with faith"
  51,56,I created the jinn and humans for nothing else but that they may serve Me
  51,57,"I desire from them no provision, nor do I want them to feed Me"
  51,58,"Surely Allah is the Bestower of all provision, the Lord of all power, the Strong"
  51,59,The wrong-doers shall receive a portion of the chastisements as their fellows (of yore). So let them not rush Me
  51,60,"Woe, then, betide those who disbelieved in that Day of theirs which they are being asked to hold in dread"
  52,1,By the Mount
  52,2,and the Book inscribed
  52,3,on fine parchment
  52,4,by the much-frequented House
  52,5,by the elevated canopy
  52,6,and by the swelling sea
  52,7,verily your Lord's chastisement shall come to pass
  52,8,none can avert that
  52,9,(It shall come to pass) on the Day when the heaven will convulse in a great convulsion
  52,10,and the mountains shall violently fly about
  52,11,"Woe, then, on that Day to those who give the lie (to this Message)"
  52,12,and amuse themselves with vain argumentation
  52,13,On the Day when they shall be thrust into Hell with a violent thrust (and shall be told)
  52,14,“This is the Hell which you used to give the lie to.”
