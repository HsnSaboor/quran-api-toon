quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,30,"Just recall the time when your Lord said to the angels, \"I am going to appoint a vicegerent on the Earth.\" They humbly enquired, \"Are you going to appoint such a one as will cause disorder and shed blood on the Earth? We are already engaged in hymning Your praise, and hallowing Your name"
  2,31,"Allah replied, \"I know what you do not know.\" After this he taught Adam the names of all things. Then He set these before the angels and asked, \"Tell Me the names of these things, if you are right (in thinking that the appointment of a vicegerent will cause disorder)"
  2,32,"They replied, \"Glory be to You. You alone are free from defect. We possess only that much knowledge which You have given us. Indeed You alone are All-Knowing and All-Wise"
  2,33,"Then Allah said to Adam, \"Tell them the names of these things.\" When Adam told them the names of all those things, Allah declared, \"Did I not tell you that I know those truths about the Earth and the Heavens which are hidden from you? I know what you disclose and what you hide"
  2,34,"Then We commanded the angels, \"Bow yourselves to Adam. \"All bowed but Iblis refused to do so; he waxed proud and joined the defiers"
  2,35,"Then We said, \"O Adam, you and your wife, both dwell in the Garden and eat to your hearts' content where from you will, but do not go near this tree; otherwise you shall become transgressors"
  2,36,"After a time Satan tempted them with that tree to disobey. Our Command and brought them out of the state they were in, and We decreed, \"Now, go down all of you from here; you are enemies of one another. Henceforth you shall dwell and provide for yourselves on the Earth for a specified period"
  2,37,"At that time Adam learnt appropriate words from his Lord and repented, and his Lord accepted his repentance, for He is very Relenting and very Merciful"
