quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  39,57,"and lest a person should say: “If only Allah had guided me, I should have been one of the God-fearing”"
  39,58,"or lest he should say, when he sees the chastisement: “O that I might return again, and be among those who do good.”"
  39,59,"Yes indeed! But My Signs came to you and you rejected them as lies, and waxed arrogant and were among those who disbelieved"
  39,60,On the Day of Resurrection you shall see that the faces of those who had lied against Allah have turned dark. Is Hell not vast enough to provide a room to the vainglorious
  39,61,"But as for the God-fearing, Allah will deliver them on account of their achievements: no harm shall visit them nor shall they grieve"
  39,62,Allah is the Creator of everything; He is the Guardian over everything
  39,63,To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. It is those who disbelieve in Allah's Signs who will be the losers
  39,64,"(O Prophet), say: “Ignorant people! Do you bid me to serve any other beside Allah?”"
  39,65,"(Tell them clearly that) it was revealed to you and to all Prophets before you: “If you associate any others with Allah in His Divinity, your works will surely come to naught and you will certainly be among the losers.”"
  39,66,"Therefore, serve Allah alone and be among those who give thanks"
  39,67,"They did not recognise the true worth of Allah. (Such is Allah's power that) on the Day of Resurrection the whole earth will be in His grasp, and the heavens shall be folded up in His Right Hand. Glory be to Him! Exalted be He from all that they associate with Him"
