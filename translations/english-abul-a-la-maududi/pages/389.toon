  28,29,"When Moses had fulfilled the term and was journeying with his family, he perceived a fire in the direction of the Mount (Sinai). He said to his family: \"Wait here; I have observed a fire. Maybe I will bring to you some news or a brand of fire from there that you may warm yourselves"
  28,30,"But when he came to the fire, a cry was heard from the right bank of the valley, from a tree in the hallowed ground: \"O Moses, verily I am Allah, the Lord of all creatures of the Universe"
  28,31,"He received the command: \"Throw away your rod!\" But when he saw the rod writhing as though it were a serpent, he turned back in retreat, and did not even look behind. (He was told): \"O Moses, go ahead and have no fear. You are perfectly secure"
  28,32,"Put your hand into your bosom, and it will come out shining without any blemish; and draw your hand close to your body to still your fear. Those are the two clear Signs from your Lord for Pharaoh and his chiefs, for truly they are a disobedient people"
  28,33,"Moses said: \"My Lord, I have killed one person from among them, and I fear that they will kill me"
  28,34,"My brother Aaron is more eloquent in speech than I: so send him with me as a helper to confirm my truthfulness for I fear that they will reject me as a liar"
  28,35,"He said: \"We will certainly strengthen you through your brother and will invest both of you with such power that they shall not be able to hurt you. With the help of Our Signs the two of you and your followers will prevail"
