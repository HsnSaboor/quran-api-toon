quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,89,"And how are they behaving now towards a Book which has come to them from Allah? Inspite of the fact that it confirms the Scriptures which they already possessed. and, inspite of the fact that, before it came, they used to pray for a signal victory over the disbelievers, they rejected it when it came, although they recognized it. May Allah's curse be upon such disbelievers"
  2,90,"What a mean thing it is with which they delude their minds. They reject the Guidance which Allah has sent down merely because of their grudge why Allah has in His bounty sent it to whom He chose from amongst His servants. They have thus incurred wrath after wrath, and for such disbelievers there is a disgraceful doom"
  2,91,"When it is said to them, \"Believe in that which Allah has sent down,\" they say, \"We believe only in that which has been sent to us\", and reject everything else, though it is the Truth and confirms what is with them. Well, ask them, \"If you sincerely believed in what was sent down to you, why did you kill the Messengers of Allah (who were sent to you from amongst yourselves)"
  2,92,"(More than that:) Moses came to you with clear Signs, yet no sooner was he away from you than you transgressed and took the calf for worship"
  2,93,"Recall also to mind the Covenant We made with you while We raised the Tur over you: `Follow strictly the precepts We are giving you and give ear to Our Commandments.' Your forefathers replied, \"We have heard but we will not obey.\" They were so prone to unbelief that they cherished the calf in their hearts. Tell them (O Muhammad). \"If indeed you are believers, yours is a strange Faith that enjoins you to do such evil things"
