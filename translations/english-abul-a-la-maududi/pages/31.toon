quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,197,"The months for Hajj are well known to all; whoever makes up his mind to perform Hajj during these fixed months, let him totally abstain from all sorts of sexual indulgence, wickedness and wrangling during the Hajj and remember that Allah knows whatever good you do. Take necessary provisions for Hajj, and piety is the best of all provisions: so refrain from disobeying Me, O men of understanding"
  2,198,"And there is nothing wrong if you also seek the bounty of your Lord during the pilgrimage. Moreover, when you return from 'Arafat, stay at Mash'aril-Haram (Muzdalifah) and remember Allah. And remember Him just as He has enjoined you, for you had gone astray before this"
  2,199,Then return from where others return and ask Allah's forgiveness. Most surely He is Forgiving and Merciful
  2,200,"And when you have performed your Hajj rites, remember Allah as you had been remembering your own forefathers, or even with greater zeal. (Even those who remember Allah do it in different ways). Some say, \"Our Lord, give us all the good things here in this world. \" Such people shall have no share in the Hereafter"
  2,201,"Then there are others who say, \"Our Lord, give us what is good in this world and also what is good in the Hereafter and save us from the torment of Fire"
  2,202,Such people shall have their due share (in both the worlds) according to what they earn. And Allah is swift at settling accounts
