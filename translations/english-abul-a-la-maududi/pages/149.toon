quran[6]{c,v,t}:

That is what He has enjoined upon you so that you may take heed"
  6,153,"This is My way -that which is straight: follow it, then, and do not follow other paths lest they scatter you from His path. This is what He has enjoined upon you, so that you may beware"

  6,155,"And likewise We revealed this (Book) - a blessed one. Follow it, then, and become God-fearing; you may be shown mercy"
