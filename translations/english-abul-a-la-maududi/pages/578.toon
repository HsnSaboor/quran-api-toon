quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,Nay; the truth is that you love ardently (the good of this world) that can be obtained hastily
  75,21,and are oblivious of the Hereafter
  75,22,Some faces on that Day will be fresh and resplendent
  75,23,and will be looking towards their Lord
  75,24,and some faces on that Day will be gloomy
  75,25,believing that a crushing calamity is about to strike them
  75,26,Nay; when a man's soul reaches up to the throat
  75,27,"and it is said: “Is there any enchanter who can step forward and help (by his chanting)?”"
  75,28,and he realises that the hour of parting is come
  75,29,and calf is inter-twined with calf
  75,30,On that Day you will be driven to your Lord
  75,31,"But he did not verify the Truth, nor did he observe Prayer"
  75,32,"on the contrary, he gave the lie to the Truth and turned his back upon it"
  75,33,"then he went back to his kinsfolk, elated with pride"
  75,34,"This (attitude) is worthy of you, altogether worthy"
  75,35,"again, it is worthy of you, altogether worthy"
  75,36,"Does man think that he will be left alone, unquestioned"
  75,37,Was he not a drop of ejaculated semen
  75,38,"then he became a clot, and then Allah made it into a living body and proportioned its parts"
  75,39,"and then He made of him a pair, male and female"
  75,40,"Does He, then, not have the power to bring back the dead to life"
  76,1,Was there a period of time when man was not even worthy of a mention
  76,2,"Verily We created man out of a drop of intermingled sperm so that We might try him, and We therefore endowed him with hearing and sight"
  76,3,"Surely We showed him the Right Path, regardless of whether he chooses to be thankful or unthankful (to his Lord)"
  76,4,"For the unbelievers, We have kept ready chains and fetters and a Blazing Fire"
  76,5,The virtuous shall drink from a cup tempered with camphor water
