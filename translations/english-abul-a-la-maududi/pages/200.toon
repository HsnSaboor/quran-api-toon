quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,80,"(O Prophet), it is all the same whether or not you ask for their forgiveness. Even if you were to ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah shall not forgive them. That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger; and Allah does not bestow His Guidance on such evil-doing folk"
  9,81,"Those who were allowed to stay behind rejoiced at remaining behind and not accompanying the Messenger of Allah. They were averse to striving in the Way of Allah with their belongings and their lives and told others: \"Do not go forth in this fierce heat.\" Tell them: \"The Hell is far fiercer in heat.\" Would that they understand"
  9,82,"Let them, then, laugh little, and weep much at the contemplation of the punishment for the evil they have committed"
  9,83,"Then if Allah brings you face to face with a party of them, and they ask your leave to go forth (to fight in the Way of Allah), tell them: \"You shall not go forth with me, and shall never fight against any enemy along with me. You were well-pleased to remain at home the first time, so now continue to remain with those who have stayed behind"
  9,84,"Do not ever pray over any of them who dies, nor stand over his grave. They disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and died in iniquity"
  9,85,"Let not their riches or their children excite your admiration. Through these Allah seeks to chastise them in this world, and that their lives will depart them while they are unbelievers"
  9,86,"And whenever any surah is revealed enjoining: \"Believe in Allah and strive (in His Way) along with His Messenger,\" the affluent among them ask you to excuse them, saying: \"Leave us with those who will sit back at home"
