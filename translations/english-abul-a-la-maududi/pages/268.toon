quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,7,"and they carry your loads to many a place which you would be unable to reach without much hardship. Surely your Lord is Intensely Loving, Most Merciful"
  16,8,"And He created horses and mules and asses for you to ride, and also for your adornment. And He creates many things (for you) that you do not even know about"
  16,9,"It rests with Allah alone to show you the Right Way, even when there are many crooked ways. Had He so willed, He would have (perforce) guided you all aright"
  16,10,He it is Who sends down water for you from the sky out of which you drink and out of which grow the plants on which you pasture your cattle
  16,11,and by virtue of which He causes crops and olives and date-palms and grapes and all kinds of fruit to grow for you. Surely in this there is a great Sign for those who reflect
  16,12,He has subjected for you the night and the day and the sun and the moon and the stars have also been made subservient by His command. Surely there are Signs in this for those who use their reason
  16,13,And there are also Signs for those who take heed in the numerous things of various colours that He has created for you on earth
  16,14,And He it is Who has subjected the sea that you may eat fresh fish from it and bring forth ornaments from it that you can wear. And you see ships ploughing their course through it so that you may go forth seeking His Bounty and be grateful to Him
