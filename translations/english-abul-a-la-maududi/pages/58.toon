quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,62,"This is the true story. There is no God but Allah, and assuredly Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise"
  3,63,"And if they turn their backs, truly Allah knows those who cause mischief"
  3,64,"Say: 'People of the Book! Come to a word common between us and you: that we shall serve none but Allah and shall associate none with Him in His divinity and that some of us will not take others as lords beside Allah.' And if they turn their backs (from accepting this call), tell them: 'Bear witness that we are the ones who have submitted ourselves exclusively to Allah"
  3,65,People of the Book! Why do you dispute with us about Abraham even though the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after the time of Abraham? Do you not understand
  3,66,"Behold, you are those who have disputed greatly concerning matters which you knew; why are you now disputing about matters that you know nothing about? Allah knows it whereas you do not know"
  3,67,"Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian; he was a Muslim, wholly devoted to God. And he certainly was not amongst those who associate others with Allah in His divinity"
  3,68,"Surely the people who have the best claim to a relationship with Abraham are those who followed him in the past, and presently this Prophet and those who believe in him; Allah is the guardian of the men of faith"
  3,69,"A party of the People of the Book would fain lead you astray, whereas in truth they lead none astray except themselves, but they do not realize it"
  3,70,O People of the Book! Why do you reject the signs of Allah even though you yourselves witness them
