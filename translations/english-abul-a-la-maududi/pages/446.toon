quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,1,By those who range themselves in rows
  37,2,by those who reprove severely
  37,3,and those who recite the Exhortation
  37,4,surely your God is One
  37,5,"the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of whatever lies between the two, the Lord of the Easts"
  37,6,We have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the stars
  37,7,and have protected it from every rebellious satan
  37,8,These satans cannot listen to what transpires in the High Council for they are pelted away from every side
  37,9,and are repelled. Theirs is an unceasing chastisement
  37,10,"And if any is able to snatch a fragment, he is pursued by a piercing flame"
  37,11,"So ask them (that is, human beings): “Were they harder to create than the objects We created?” We created them from sticky clay"
  37,12,You marvel (at the wondrous creations of Allah) and they scoff at it
  37,13,"and when they are admonished, they pay no heed"
  37,14,"and if they see any Sign, they laugh it away"
  37,15,"and say: “This is nothing but plain sorcery"
  37,16,"Is it ever possible that after we die and are reduced to dust and (a skeleton of) bones, we will be raised to life"
  37,17,And so also shall our forefathers of yore be raised to life?”
  37,18,"Tell them: “Yes; and you are utterly helpless (against Allah).”"
  37,19,"There will be a single stern rebuff and lo, they will be observing with their own eyes (all that they had been warned against)"
  37,20,"They will then say: “Woe for us. This is the Day of Judgement.”"
  37,21,"“Yes, this is the Day of Final Decision that you used to deny as a lie.”"
  37,22,"(Then will the command be given): “Muster all the wrong-doers and their spouses and the deities whom they used to serve"
  37,23,"apart from Allah, and direct them to the path of Hell"
  37,24,and detain them there; they will be called to account
