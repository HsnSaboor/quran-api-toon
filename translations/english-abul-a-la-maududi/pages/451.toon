quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"But they denounced him as a liar, so they will surely be arraigned (for punishment)"
  37,128,except Allah's chosen servants
  37,129,We preserved a good name for him among posterity
  37,130,Peace be upon Elias
  37,131,Thus do We reward the good-doers
  37,132,He was one of Our believing servants
  37,133,And Lot too was one of the Messengers
  37,134,(Call to mind) when We delivered him and all his kinsfolk
  37,135,except for an old woman who was among those that stayed behind
  37,136,Then We utterly destroyed the rest of them
  37,137,You pass by their desolate habitations in the morning
  37,138,and at night. Do you still not understand
  37,139,And Jonah too was one of the Messengers
  37,140,Call to mind when he fled to the laden ship
  37,141,"cast lots, and was among the losers"
  37,142,"Then a fish swallowed him, and he was blameworthy"
  37,143,Had he not been one of those who glorify Allah
  37,144,he would certainly have remained in its belly till the Day of Resurrection
  37,145,But We threw him on a wide bare tract of land while he was ill
  37,146,and caused a gourd tree to grow over him
  37,147,and We sent him forth to a nation of a hundred thousand or more
  37,148,and they believed. So We let them enjoy life for a while
  37,149,"So ask their opinion: “(Are you convinced) that your Lord should have daughters and you should have sons"
  37,150,Did We create the angels as females the while they witnessed?”
  37,151,"Behold, it is one of their fabrications that they say"
  37,152,“Allah has begotten.” They are liars
  37,153,Did He choose daughters rather than sons
