quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,"and He it is Who created the two kinds, the male and the female"
  53,46,from a drop of sperm when it was emitted
  53,47,and that it is for Him to grant the second life
  53,48,that He it is Who bestowed wealth and riches
  53,49,that He is the Lord of Sirius
  53,50,that He it is Who destroyed the ancient 'Ad
  53,51,"and Thamud, leaving no trace of them"
  53,52,and that He it is Who destroyed the people of Noah before for they were much given to iniquity and transgression
  53,53,And He brought perdition upon the subverted cities
  53,54,and caused them to be covered with that which He covered them with
  53,55,"So, which of your Lord's bounties will you doubt?”"
  53,56,This is a warning among the warnings of yore
  53,57,The imminent Hour has drawn near
  53,58,and none but Allah can avert it
  53,59,"Will you, then, wonder at this"
  53,60,Will you laugh at it rather than weep
  53,61,Will you occupy yourselves simply in merriment
  53,62,"Prostrate yourselves before Allah, and serve Him"
  54,1,The Hour of Resurrection drew near and the moon split asunder
  54,2,"(Regardless of any Signs these people see), they turn away and say: “This is an ongoing sorcery.”"
  54,3,They also gave the lie to (the splitting asunder of the moon) and only followed their desires. Yet everything is destined to reach an end
  54,4,Surely there came to them narratives (of the ancient nations) that should suffice to deter (them from transgression)
  54,5,narratives that are full of consummate wisdom. But warnings do not avail them
  54,6,"So turn away from them, (O Prophet). On the Day when a caller shall call them to a thing most terrible"
