quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,103,When both surrendered (to Allah's command) and Abraham flung the son down on his forehead
  37,104,"We cried out: “O Abraham"
  37,105,you have indeed fulfilled your dream. Thus do We reward the good-doers.”
  37,106,This was indeed a plain trial
  37,107,And We ransomed him with a mighty sacrifice
  37,108,and We preserved for him a good name among posterity
  37,109,Peace be upon Abraham
  37,110,Thus do We reward the good-doers
  37,111,Surely he was one of Our believing servants
  37,112,"And We gave him the good news of Isaac, a Prophet and among the righteous ones"
  37,113,And We blessed him and Isaac. Among the offspring of the two some did good and some plainly wronged themselves
  37,114,Verily We bestowed Our favours on Moses and Aaron
  37,115,and We delivered both of them and their people from the great calamity
  37,116,"We succoured them, and they gained the upper hand (against their enemies)"
  37,117,We granted them a Clear Book
  37,118,and showed them the Straight Way
  37,119,and preserved for them a good name among posterity
  37,120,Peace be upon Moses and Aaron
  37,121,Thus do We reward the good-doers
  37,122,Surely both of them were among Our believing servants
  37,123,"Surely, Elias too was among the Messengers"
  37,124,"(Call to mind) when he said to his people: “Will you not fear Allah"
  37,125,Do you call upon Baal and forsake the Best of the Creators
  37,126,Allah is your Lord and the Lord of your ancestors of yore.”
