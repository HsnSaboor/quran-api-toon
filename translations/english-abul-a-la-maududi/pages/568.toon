quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,Today he has been left here friendless
  69,36,and has no food except the filth from the washing of wounds
  69,37,which only the sinners will eat.”
  69,38,But no; I swear by what you see
  69,39,and by what you do not see
  69,40,that this is the speech of an honourable Messenger
  69,41,not the speech of a poet. Little do you believe
  69,42,Nor is this the speech of a soothsayer. Little do you reflect
  69,43,It has been revealed by the Lord of the Universe
  69,44,"And if he [i.e., the Prophets] had forged this Discourse and thereafter ascribed it to Us"
  69,45,We would surely have seized him by the right hand
  69,46,and then severed his life vein
  69,47,and not one of you would have been able to withhold Us from doing so
  69,48,Surely it is a Good Counsel for the God-fearing
  69,49,We certainly know that some among you will give the lie to it
  69,50,and surely it will be a cause of regret for the unbelievers
  69,51,Certainly it is a Truth of absolute certainty
  69,52,So glorify the name of your Lord Most Great
  70,1,A beseecher besought the visitation of chastisement
  70,2,"(a chastisement meant) for the unbelievers, one which none can avert"
  70,3,"a chastisement from Allah, the Lord of the ascending steps"
  70,4,by which the angels and the Spirit ascend to Him in one Day the duration of which is fifty thousand years
  70,5,"So, (O Prophet), persevere with gracious perseverance"
  70,6,Verily they think that the chastisement is far off
  70,7,while We think that it is near at hand
  70,8,It shall befall on a Day whereon the sky will become like molten brass
  70,9,and the mountains will become like dyed tufts of wool
  70,10,and no bosom friend will enquire about any of his bosom friends
