quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,164,"(If they want a sign for the perception of this Reality) surety there are countless signs for those who use their common sense; they can see alternation of the night and day, in the ships that sail the ocean laden with cargoes beneficial to mankind, and in the rain-water which Allah sends down from the sky and thereby gives life to the earth after its death and spreads over it all kinds of animate creatures, in the blowing of the winds and in the clouds which obediently wait for orders between the sky and the earth"
  2,165,"(In spite of such clear signs of the Oneness of Allah), there are people who set up equals and rivals with Allah and adore them with the adoration due to Allah. whereas the Believers adore Allah most ardently. Would that these transgressors could realize now what they will realize, when they will see the chastisement before them that power and authority wholly belong to Allah and that Allah is severe in punishment"
  2,166,"When He will inflict punishment, those very leaders and guides whom they followed in the world will disown them. But punishment they shall get and all their bonds shall be cut off"
  2,167,"Then those who followed them will say, \"Would that we were given another chance to return to the world: then we will disown them just as they have disowned us today.\" Thus will Allah bring before them the deeds they did in the world in such a manner as to make them wring their hands in regret but they shall be unable to come out of the Fire"
  2,168,"O people, eat of what is lawful and clean in the earth and do not follow the ways of Satan, for he is your avowed enemy"
  2,169,He enjoins you to commit vice and indecency and induces you to attribute to Allah's name things you do not know to be from Him
