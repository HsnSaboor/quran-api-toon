quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  36,13,"Recite to them, as a case in point, the story of the people of the town when the Messengers came to them"
  36,14,We sent to them two Messengers and they rejected both of them as liars. Then We strengthened them with a third (Messenger)
  36,15,"They said: “We have been sent to you as Messengers.” The people of the town said: “You are only human beings like ourselves, and the Merciful Lord has revealed nothing. You are simply lying.”"
  36,16,"The Messengers said: “Our Lord knows that we have indeed been sent to you"
  36,17,and our duty is no more than to clearly convey the Message.”
  36,18,"The people of the town said: “We believe you are an evil omen for us. If you do not desist, we will stone you or you will receive a grievous chastisement from us.”"
  36,19,"The Messengers replied: “Your evil omen is with you. (Are you saying this) because you were asked to take heed? The truth is that you are a people who have exceeded all bounds.”"
  36,20,"In the meantime a man came running from the far end of the town, saying: “My people, follow the Messengers"
  36,21,follow those who do not ask any recompense from you and are rightly-guided
  36,22,Why should I not serve the One Who created me and to Whom all of you shall be sent back
  36,23,"What! Shall I take any deities apart from Him whose intercession will not avail me the least were the Merciful One to bring any adversity upon me, nor will they be able to rescue me"
  36,24,Surely in that case I should indeed be in evident error
  36,25,I believe in your Lord; so listen to me.”
  36,26,"(Eventually they killed him and he was told): “Enter Paradise.” The man exclaimed: “Would that my people knew"
  36,27,for what reason Allah has forgiven me and placed me among the honoured ones.”
