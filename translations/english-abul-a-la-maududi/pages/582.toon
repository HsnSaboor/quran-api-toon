quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,About what are they asking one another
  78,2,Is it about the awesome tiding
  78,3,that they are in utter disagreement
  78,4,No indeed; soon will they come to know
  78,5,"again, no indeed; soon will they come to know"
  78,6,Have We not spread the earth like a bed
  78,7,and fixed the mountains like pegs
  78,8,and created you in pairs (as men and women)
  78,9,and made your sleep a means of repose
  78,10,and made the night a covering
  78,11,and made the day to seek livelihood
  78,12,and built above you seven strong firmaments
  78,13,"and placed therein a hot, shining lamp"
  78,14,and sent down abundant water from the clouds
  78,15,so that We may thereby bring forth grain and vegetation
  78,16,and gardens dense with foliage
  78,17,Surely the Day of Judgement has an appointed time
  78,18,"the Day when the Trumpet shall be blown, and you will come forth in multitudes"
  78,19,and when the sky shall be opened up and will become all doors
  78,20,and the mountains will be set in motion and become a mirage
  78,21,Surely the Hell is an ambush
  78,22,a resort for the rebellious
  78,23,therein they shall abide for ages
  78,24,"they shall taste in it no coolness, nor any pleasant drink"
  78,25,save boiling water and wash of the wounds
  78,26,a befitting recompense for their deeds
  78,27,For indeed they did not look forward to any reckoning
  78,28,and roundly denied Our Signs as false
  78,29,And everything have We recorded in a Book
  78,30,So taste (the fruit of your deeds). We shall only increase your torment
