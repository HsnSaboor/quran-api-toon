quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,Since the Quraysh became accustomed
  106,2,accustomed to the journey of winter and summer
  106,3,"therefore, let them worship the Lord of this House"
  106,4,"Who fed them against hunger, and secured them against fear"
  107,1,Did you see him who gives the lie to the Reward and Punishment of the Hereafter
  107,2,Such is the one who repulses the orphans away
  107,3,and urges not the feeding of the needy
  107,4,"Woe, then, to those who pray"
  107,5,but are heedless in their Prayers
  107,6,those who do good (in order) to be seen
  107,7,and deny people the articles of common necessity
  108,1,"(O Prophet), We have surely bestowed upon you good in abundance"
  108,2,So offer Prayer and sacrifice to your Lord alone
  108,3,Verily your enemy alone has been cut off from the roots
