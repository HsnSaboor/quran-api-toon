quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger you see that their eyes overflow with tears because of the Truth that they recognize and they say: 'Our Lord! We do believe; write us down, therefore, with those who bear witness (to the Truth)"
  5,84,And why should we not believe in Allah and the Truth which has come down to us when we do fervently desire that our Lord include us among the righteous
  5,85,So Allah rewarded them for these words with Gardens beneath which rivers flow so that they would abide there for ever. Such is the reward of the people who do good
  5,86,Those who disbelieved and gave the lie to Our signs are rightfully the inmates of the Blazing Flame
  5,87,"Believers! Do not hold as unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful to you, and do not exceed the bounds of right. Allah does not love those who transgress the bounds of right"
  5,88,"And partake of the lawful, good things which Allah has provided you as sustenance, and refrain from disobeying Allah in Whom you believe"
  5,89,"Allah does not take you to task for the oaths you utter vainly, but He will certainly take you to task for the oaths you have sworn in earnest. The expiation (for breaking such oaths) is either to feed ten needy persons with more or less the same food as you are wont to give to your families, or to clothe them, or to set free from bondage the neck of one man; and he who does not find the means shall fast for three days. This shall be the expiation for your oaths whenever you have sworn (and broken them.) But do keep your oaths. Thus does Allah make clear to you His commandments; maybe you will be grateful"
