  16,45,Do those who have been devising evil plans (against the mission of the Messenger) feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them up or that chastisement will not come upon them from a direction that they will not even be able to imagine
  16,46,or that He will not suddenly seize them while they are going about to and fro and they will be unable to frustrate His design
  16,47,"or that He will not seize them when they are apprehensive of the impending calamity? Surely your Lord is Most Compassionate, Most Merciful"
