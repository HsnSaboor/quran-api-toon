quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Have you seen him who rejected Our signs and said: \"Surely I shall continue to be favoured with riches and children"
  19,78,"Has he obtained knowledge of the Unseen, or has he taken a covenant with the Most Compassionate Lord"
  19,79,By no means! We shall write down all what he says; and We shall greatly prolong his chastisement
  19,80,"and We shall inherit all the resources and hosts of which he boasts, and he will come to Us all alone"
  19,81,They have taken other gods instead of Allah that they may be a source of strength for them
  19,82,By no means! They shall soon deny their worship and shall become their adversaries instead
  19,83,Do you not see that We have sent devils upon the unbelievers who greatly incite them (to oppose the Truth)
  19,84,"Therefore, do not hasten (in seeking a scourge against them). We are counting their days"
  19,85,"The Day shall soon come when We shall bring together the God-fearing to the Most Compassionate Lord, as honoured guests"
  19,86,and We shall drive the guilty ones to Hell as a thirsty herd
  19,87,On that Day none will have the power to intercede for them except those who received a sanction from the Most Compassionate Lord
  19,88,"They claim: \"The Most Compassionate Lord has taken a son to Himself"
  19,89,Surely you have made a monstrous statement
  19,90,"It is such a monstrosity that heavens might well-nigh burst forth at it, the earth might be cleaved, and the mountains fall"
  19,91,at their ascribing a son to the Most Compassionate Lord
  19,92,It does not befit the Most Compassionate Lord that He should take a son
  19,93,There is no one in the heavens and the earth but he shall come to the Most Compassionate Lord as His servant
  19,94,Verily He encompasses them and has counted them all
  19,95,On the Day of Resurrection each one of these will come to Him singly
