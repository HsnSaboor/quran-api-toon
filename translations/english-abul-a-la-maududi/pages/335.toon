  22,24,They were guided (to accept) the pure word; they were guided to the Way of the Praiseworthy (Lord)
  22,25,"Indeed those who disbelieve and who (now) hinder people from the Way of Allah and hinder them from the Holy Mosque which We have set up (as a place of worship) for all people, equally for those who dwell therein and for those who come from outside, (they surely deserve punishment). Whosoever deviates therein from the Right Way and acts with iniquity, We shall cause him to taste a painful chastisement"
  22,26,"Call to mind when We assigned to Abraham the site of the House (Kabah), directing him: \"Do not associate aught with Me\" and \"Keep My House pure for those who walk around it, and for those who stand and who bow down and who prostrate themselves (in worship)"

  22,30,"Such (was the purpose of building the Kabah). Whosoever, then, venerates Allah's sanctities will find it to be good for him in the sight of his Lord. Cattle have been made lawful for you except those mentioned to you (as unlawful). So shun the abomination of idols and shun all words of falsehood"
