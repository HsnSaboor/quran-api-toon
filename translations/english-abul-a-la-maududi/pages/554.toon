  62,9,"Believers, when the call for Prayer is made on Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and give up all trading. That is better for you, if you only knew"
  62,10,"But when the Prayer is ended, disperse in the land and seek Allah's Bounty, and remember Allah much so that you may prosper"
  62,11,"Yet no sooner than they saw some trading or amusement, they flocked to it and left you standing by yourself. Tell them: “That which is with Allah is far better than amusement and trading. Allah is the Best Provider of sustenance.”"
  63,1,"(O Prophet), when the hypocrites come to you, they say: “We bear witness that you are certainly Allah's Messenger.” Allah certainly knows that you are His Messenger. But Allah also bears witness that the hypocrites are utter liars"
  63,2,"They shelter behind their oath, and thus hinder their own selves and others from the Path of Allah. Evil indeed is what they do"
  63,3,"All that is because they first believed and then disbelieved, and therefore a seal was set on their hearts; as a result they understand nothing"
  63,4,"When you look at them, their persons are pleasing, and when they speak, you pay heed to what they say. But in truth they are (merely) beams of timber propped-up (against a wall). They consider every shout they hear to be directed against them. They are your utter enemies; guard against them. May Allah do away with them! How are they being turned away (from the Truth)"
