quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  76,26,"and prostrate yourself before Him at night, and extol His Glory during the long watches of the night"
  76,27,Verily they love (the good of this world) that is hastily obtainable and are oblivious of the burdensome Day ahead of them
  76,28,"We created them and strengthened their joints; and whenever We wish, We can change their faces entirely"
  76,29,Verily this is an Exhortation; so let him who so will take a way to his Lord
  76,30,"But your willing shall be of no avail until Allah Himself so wills. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise"
  76,31,"He admits to His Mercy whomsoever He pleases. As for the wrong-doers, He has prepared for them a grievous chastisement"
  77,1,By the (winds) sent forth in quick succession
  77,2,which then blow tempestuously
  77,3,and raise (clouds) and scatter them around
  77,4,then winnow them thoroughly
  77,5,and then cast (Allah's) remembrance (in people's hearts)
  77,6,to serve as an excuse or a warning
  77,7,Surely what you are promised shall come to pass
  77,8,So when the stars are extinguished
  77,9,and the sky is rent asunder
  77,10,and the mountains are blown away
  77,11,"and the appointed time to bring the Messengers together arrives, (then shall the promised event come to pass)"
  77,12,To which Day has this task been deferred
  77,13,To the Day of Judgement
  77,14,What do you know what the Day of Judgement is
  77,15,Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth
  77,16,Did We not destroy many a nation of the earlier times
  77,17,And We shall cause those of later times to follow them
  77,18,Thus do We deal with the guilty
  77,19,Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth
