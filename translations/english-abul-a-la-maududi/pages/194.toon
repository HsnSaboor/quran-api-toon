quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,41,"March forth whether light or heavy, and strive in the way of Allah with your belongings and your lives. That is best for you if you only knew it"
  9,42,"Were it a gain at hand or a short journey, they would have surely followed you, but the distance seemed too far to them. Still they will swear by Allah: \"If only we could, we would surely have gone forth with you.\" They merely bring ruin upon themselves. Allah knows well that they are liars"
  9,43,"(O Prophet), may Allah forgive you! Why did you give them leave to stay behind before it became clear to you as to who were truthful and who were liars"
  9,44,Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day will never ask your leave to be excused from striving (in the cause of Allah) with their belongings and their lives. Allah fully knows the God-fearing
  9,45,"It is only those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, and whose hearts are filled with doubt that seek exemption from striving (in the cause of Allah). They keep tossing to and fro in their doubt"
  9,46,"Had they truly intended to march forth to fight, they would have certainly made some preparation for it. But Allah was averse to their going forth, so He made them lag behind, and they were told: \"Stay behind with those that are staying behind"
  9,47,"Had they gone forth with you, they would have only added to your trouble, and would have run about in your midst seeking to stir up sedition among you, whereas there are among you some who are prone to lend ears to them. Allah knows well the wrong-doers"
