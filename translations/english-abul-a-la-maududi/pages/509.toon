quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"The believers used to say: “Why is a surah (that would ordain fighting) not revealed?” But when a definitive surah was revealed wherein fighting was mentioned, you saw that those in whose hearts there was a sickness looked at you as though they were about to faint at the approach of death. Pity on them"
  47,21,"(They keep affirming their) obedience and saying good words. But when a course of action was clearly determined, it would have been better for them if they had proved true to Allah"
  47,22,"Now, if you were to turn away, what else can be expected but that you will work corruption in the land and fly at each other's throats"
  47,23,"It is these upon whom Allah has laid His curse: so He made them deaf and deprived them of their sight"
  47,24,"Do they, then, not reflect on the Qur'an? Or are there locks on their hearts"
  47,25,"Certainly those who have turned their backs on the True Guidance after it became manifest to them, Satan has embellished their ways for them and has buoyed them up with false hopes"
  47,26,"This, because they said to those who are averse to the faith that Allah has revealed: “In some matters we shall obey you.” Allah has full knowledge of their secret parleys"
  47,27,"But how will they fare when angels will take their souls at death and will carry them, striking their faces and backs"
  47,28,"That is because they have followed a way that angered Allah, and have been averse to His good pleasure. So He reduced all their works to nought"
  47,29,"Or do they, in whose hearts there is a sickness, believe that Allah will not bring their failings to light"
