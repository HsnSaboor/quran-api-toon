quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  28,85,"(O Prophet), surely He Who has ordained the Qur'an on you will bring you to the best end. Say to them: \"My Lord knows best who has brought true guidance and who is in clear error"
  28,86,"(O Prophet), you never looked forward for the Book to be revealed to you. It is out of sheer Mercy of your Lord that it was (revealed to you). So do not lend any support to the unbelievers"
  28,87,And let it never happen that the unbelievers might turn you away from the revelations of Allah after they have been revealed to you. Call people to your Lord and never become one of the unbelievers
  28,88,and do not invoke any god beside Allah. There is no god but He. All will perish but He. To Him belongs the command. And to Him shall all of you return
  29,1,Alif. Lam. Mim
  29,2,"Do people think that they will be let go merely by saying: “We believe,” and that they will not be tested"

  29,4,Do the evil-doers suppose that they will get the better of Us? How evil is their judgement
  29,5,"Let him who looks forward to meeting Allah know that Allah's appointed term will surely come to pass. He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
  29,6,Whosoever strives (in the cause of Allah) does so to his own good. Surely Allah stands in no need of anyone in the whole Universe
