quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  8,34,"But what prevents Allah from chastising them now when they are hindering people from the Holy Mosque, even though they are not even its true guardians. For its true guardians are none but the God-fearing, though most of them do not know that"
  8,35,"Their Prayer at the House is nothing but whistling and handclapping. Taste, then, this chastisement for your denying the truth"
  8,36,"Surely those who deny the truth spend their wealth to hinder people from the way of Allah, and will continue to so spend until their efforts become a source of intense regret for them, and then they will be vanquished, and then these deniers of the truth will be driven to Hell"
  8,37,"so that Allah may separate the bad from the good, and join together all those who are bad into a pile one upon another, and cast them into Hell. They, it is they who are the losers"
  8,38,"[O Prophet!] Tell the unbelievers that if they desist from evil, their past shall be forgiven and if they revert to their past ways, then it is well known what happened with the people of the past"
  8,39,"And fight against them until the mischief ends and the way prescribed by Allah - the whole of it -prevail Then, if they give up mischief, surely Allah sees what they do"
  8,40,"But if they turn away, then know well that Allah is your Protector - an excellent Protector and an excellent Helper"
