quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  12,64,"The father said: \"Shall I trust you with regard to him as I had trusted you earlier with regard to his brother? Allah is the Best Protector and is the Most Merciful"
  12,65,"And when they opened their things they found that their goods had been given back to them. Thereupon they cried: \"Father! What else would we desire? Look, even our goods have been given back to us, so we shall go now and bring supplies for our family, we shall protect our brother, and bring another camel-load of corn. That additional supply will be easily secured"
  12,66,"Their father said: \"I shall never send him with you until you give me a solemn promise in the name of Allah that you will bring him back to me, unless you yourselves are surrounded.\" Then after they had given him their solemn promise, he said. \"Allah watches over what we have said"
  12,67,"And he enjoined them: \"My sons! Do not enter the city by one gate; rather enter it by different gates. I can be of no help to you against Allah. Allah's command alone prevails. In Him have I put my trust and in Him should all those who have faith put their trust"
  12,68,"And it so happened that when they entered the city (by many gates) as their father had directed them, this precautionary measure proved ineffective against Allah's will. There was an uneasiness in Jacob's soul which he so tried to remove. Surely he was possessed of knowledge owing to the knowledge that We bestowed upon him. But most people do not know the truth of the matter"
  12,69,"When they presented themselves before Joseph, he took his brother aside to himself and said: \"Verily I am your own brother Joseph; so do not grieve over the manner they have treated you"
