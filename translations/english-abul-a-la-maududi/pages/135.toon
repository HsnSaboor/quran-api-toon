quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,60,"He recalls your souls by night, and knows what you do by day; and then He raises you back each day in order that the term appointed by Him is fulfilled. Then to Him you will return whereupon He will let you know what you have been doing"
  6,61,"And He alone holds sway over His servants and sets guardians over you till death approaches any of you and Our deputed angels take his soul, neglecting no part of their task"
  6,62,"Then all are restored to Allah, their true protector. Behold, His is the judgement. He is the swiftest of those who take account"
  6,63,"Ask them (O Muhammad!): 'Who is it that delivers you from dangers in the deep darknesses of the land and the sea, and to whom do you call in humility and in the secrecy of your hearts? To whom do you pray: \"If He will but save us from this distress, we shall most certainly be among the thankful"
  6,64,"Say: \"It is Allah alone Who delivers you from this and from every distress, and yet you associate others with Allah in His divinity"
  6,65,"Say: \"It is He Who has the power to send forth chastisement upon you from above you, or from beneath your feet, or split you into hostile groups and make some of you taste each others' violence. Behold, how We set forth Our signs in diverse forms, so that maybe they will understand the Truth"
  6,66,"Your people have denied it even though it is the Truth. Say: \"I am not a guardian over You"
  6,67,Every tiding has its appointed time; you yourselves will soon know (the end)
  6,68,"When you see those who are engaged in blasphemy against Our signs, turn away from them until they begin to talk of other things; and should Satan ever cause you to forget, then do not remain, after recollection, in the company of those wrong-doing people"
