quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  21,36,"When the unbelievers see you they make you an object of fun, saying: \"Is he the one who mentions your gods?\" They say so, and yet they reject with disdain the very mention of the Most Compassionate Lord"
  21,37,Man is hasty by nature. I shall certainly show you My Signs. Do not ask Me to be hasty
  21,38,"They say: \"(Tell us) when will the threat of punishment come to pass if you are truthful"
  21,39,"If only the unbelievers knew of the Hour when they shall not be able to keep off the Fire from their faces, nor from their backs; nor shall they be helped"
  21,40,"That will suddenly come upon them and stupefy them. They shall not be able to ward it off, nor shall they be granted any respite"
  21,41,"Other Messengers before you were also mocked, but those who scoffed at the Messengers were overtaken by the same scourge that they had scoffed at"
  21,42,"Tell them, (O Muhammad): \"Who protects you, during the night or the day from the Most Compassionate Lord?\" And yet they turn away from the Admonition of their Lord"
  21,43,Do they have any gods who would protect them against Us? They have no power even to help themselves; nor do they enjoy Our support
  21,44,"Nay, We generously provided them and their fathers, and they enjoyed Our provision for long. Do they not see that We are now advancing into their territory, diminishing it from different sides? Is it they, then, who will triumph"
