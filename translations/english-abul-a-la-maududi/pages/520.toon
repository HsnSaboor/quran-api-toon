quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,How many a nation did We destroy before them that were stronger in prowess than these. They searched about the lands of the world. But could they find a refuge
  50,37,Verily there is a lesson in this for everyone who has a (sound) heart and who listens with an attentive mind
  50,38,"We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days, and weariness did not even touch Us"
  50,39,"Hence bear with patience whatever they say, and celebrate your Lord's glory before the rising of the sun and before its setting"
  50,40,"and in the night, too, celebrate His glory, in the wake of prostration"
  50,41,Hearken on the Day when the caller will call from a place nearby
  50,42,the Day when they shall hear the Blast in truth. That will be the Day (for the dead) to come forth
  50,43,"Surely it is We Who give life and cause death, and to Us shall all return"
  50,44,"on the Day when the earth will be rent asunder and people, rising from it, will hasten forth. To assemble them all will be easy for Us"
  50,45,"(O Prophet), We are well aware of what they say; and you are not required to force things on them. So exhort with the Qur'an all those who fear My warning"
  51,1,By the winds which scatter dust
  51,2,which carry clouds laden with water
  51,3,which then smoothly speed along
  51,4,and execute the great task of apportioning (rainfall)
  51,5,surely what you are being warned against is true
  51,6,and the Judgement shall doubtlessly take place
