quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,35,"Those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity say: \"Were Allah to will so, neither we nor our forefathers would have worshipped any other than Him, nor would we have prohibited anything without His command.\" Their predecessors proffered similar excuses. Do the Messengers have any other duty but to plainly convey the Message"
  16,36,"We raised a Messenger in every community (to tell them): \"Serve Allah and shun the Evil One.\" Thereafter Allah guided some of them while others were overtaken by error. Go about the earth, then, and observe what was the end of those who rejected the Messengers, calling them liars"
  16,37,"(O Muhammad), howsoever eager you may be to show them the Right Way, Allah does not bestow His guidance on those whom He lets go astray; and in fact none will be able to help them"
  16,38,"They swear most solemnly in the name of Allah and say: \"Allah shall not raise to life any who dies.\" (Yes, He will do so); that is a promise by which He is bound, even though most people do not know that"
  16,39,(That is bound to happen in order that) He may make clear to them the reality regarding the matters on which they differ and that the unbelievers may realize that they were liars
  16,40,"(As for the possibility of resurrection, bear in mind that) whenever We do will something, We have to do no more than say: \"Be\", and it is"
  16,41,"As for those who have forsaken their homes for the sake of Allah after enduring persecution, We shall certainly grant them a good abode in this world; and surely the reward of the Hereafter is much greater. If they could but know (what an excellent end awaits)"
  16,42,those who remain steadfast and put their trust in their Lord
