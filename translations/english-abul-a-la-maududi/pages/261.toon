  14,44,"(O Muhammad), warn mankind of the Day when a severe chastisement shall overtake them, and the wrong-doers will say: \"Our Lord, grant us respite for a short while; we shall respond to Your call and will follow Your Messengers.\" (But they will be clearly told): \"Are you not the same who swore earlier that they shall never suffer decline"
  14,45,"You said so even though you had lived in the dwellings of those who had wronged themselves (by sinning), and you were aware how We dealt with them, and We had even explained to you all this by giving examples"
  14,46,"Indeed the unbelievers contrived their plan, but it is in Allah's power to nullify their plan, even though their plans were such that would move even mountains"
