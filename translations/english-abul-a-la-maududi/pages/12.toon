quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,77,Do they really not know that Allah is fully aware of what they hide and what they disclose
  2,78,Then there are among them some un-lettered people who have no knowledge of the Book but depend upon empty hopes and are guided by mere conjecture and guess-work
  2,79,"So woe to their learned people, who write the law with their own hands and then say to the people, \"This is from Allah,\" so that they might gain some paltry worldly end. (They do not see that) this writing of their hands will bring woe to them and what they gain thereby will lead to their ruin"
  2,80,"They also say, \"The fire of Hell is not going to touch us, and even if it does at all, it will be only for a few days\". Say, \"Have you obtained a promise from Allah which He would not break? Or, do you attribute to Allah things you do not know? Why will not the fire of Hell touch you"
  2,81,Whoever earns evil and becomes engrossed in sin shall be doomed to Hell and abide therein for ever
  2,82,"Only those people who believe and do good deeds, will be the dwellers of the Garden and live there for ever"
  2,83,"Remember that We made a solemn covenant with the children of Israel to this effect: worship none save Allah: be good to your parents, to your relatives, to the orphans and to the helpless; speak aright with the people: establish the Salat and pay the Zakat. But with the exception of a few, you all slid back from it and are paying no heed to it even now"
