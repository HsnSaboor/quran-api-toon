quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  28,51,We have constantly conveyed them the word (of admonition) that they may take heed
  28,52,"Those on whom We bestowed the Book before do believe in this (to wit, the Qur'an)"
  28,53,"When it is recited to them they say: \"We believe in it for it is the Truth from our Lord. Indeed we were already Muslims"
  28,54,"These will be granted their reward twice over because they remained steadfast; they repel evil with good, and spend (in alms) out of the sustenance We provided them"
  28,55,"and when they hear any vain talk, they turn away from it, saying: \"We have our deeds and you have your deeds. Peace be to you. We do not desire to act like the ignorant"
  28,56,"(O Prophet), you cannot grant guidance to whom you please. It is Allah Who guides those whom He will. He knows best who are amenable to guidance"
  28,57,"They say: \"If we were to follow this guidance with you, we should be snatched away from our land.\" Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary to which fruits of all kinds are brought as a provision from Us? But most of them do not know"
  28,58,And how many a town did We destroy whose inhabitants exulted on account of their affluence. These are their dwellings in which very few dwelt after them. Eventually it is We Who inherited them
  28,59,Your Lord would not destroy a town until He had sent to its centre a Messenger who would recite to them Our verses. Nor would We destroy any town unless its inhabitants were iniquitous
