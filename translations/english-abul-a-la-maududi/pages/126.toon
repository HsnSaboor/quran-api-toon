quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,109,"The Day when Allah will gather together the Messengers and say: 'What answer were you given?' They will reply: 'We have no real knowledge of it. You alone fully know all that lies beyond the reach of human perception"
  5,110,"Imagine, then, when Allah will say: 'Jesus, son of Mary, recall My favour upon you and your mother, and when I strengthened you with the spirit of holiness so that you talked to men in the cradle and also when you became of age; and when I taught you the Book and Wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel; and when, by My leave, you fashioned from clay the likeness of a bird and you breathed into it, and by My leave it became a bird; you healed, by My leave, the blind from birth and the leprous; and when, by My leave, you caused the dead to come to life. And recall when I restrained the Israelites from you when you came to them with clear proofs whereupon those of them who disbelieved said: \"This is nothing but clear magic"
  5,111,"And recall when I revealed to the disciples to believe in Me and in My Mes-senger, they said: \"We do believe, and we bear witness that we indeed are the ones who submit to Allah"
  5,112,"Also recall when the disciples asked Jesus, son of Mary: 'Jesus, son of Mary, has your Lord the power to send down to us a repast from the heaven?' There- upon Jesus said: 'Fear Allah if you do indeed have faith"
  5,113,"They said: 'We desire to partake of it that our hearts be satisfied and we know that you did speak the truth to us, and that we are its witnesses"
