  2,62,"Rest assured that whosoever from among the Muslims or the Jews or the Christians or the Sabaeans believes in Allah and the Last Day, and performs good deeds, he will have his reward with his Lord and he will have no cause for fear and grief"

  2,69,"But they further asked, \"Please request your Lord to make it clear to us of what colour she should be.\" Moses answered, \"He says that she should be of yellow colour, so deep and bright as to delight the beholders"
