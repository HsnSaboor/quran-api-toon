quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,135,"The Jews say, \"Become Jews and you will be rightly guided\"; the Christians say, \"Become Christians and you will have the true guidance.\" Say to them, \"Nay, we turn away from every other way and accept the way of Abraham, and Abraham did not associate other gods with Allah"
  2,136,"O Muslims, say to them, \"We believe in Allah and the Guidance which has been sent down to us and which was sent to Abraham, Ismail, Isaac and Jacob and his descendants and which was given by their Lord to Moses and Jesus and to all other Prophets. We do not discriminate against any of them and we have completely surrendered to Allah as Muslims"
  2,137,"Then if they believe the way you have believed, they have the right guidance, and if they turn away from this, it will become obvious that they are obdurate. Therefore, rest assured that AIIah will suffice to defend you against them: He hears everything and knows every thing"
  2,138,"Say, \"Take Allah's colour, and who can give a better colour than Allah? Therefore, we worship and submit to Him alone"
  2,139,"O Prophet, say to them, \"Do you argue with us concerning AIIah, whereas He is our Lord and also your Lord? We shall be accountable to Him for our deeds and you for yours; so we have dedicated our worship to Him alone"
  2,140,"Or do you say that Abraham, Ismail, Isaac, Jacob and his children were all Jews or Christians? Ask them, \"Do you know more than Allah does? And who is more unjust than the one who hides the testimony which Allah has entrusted to him? Allah is not unaware of what you are doing"
  2,141,"They were a people who have passed away and they shall be repaid for what they earned and you for what you earn: you will not be questioned as to what they did"
