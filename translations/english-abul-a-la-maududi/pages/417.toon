quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  32,21,We shall certainly have them taste some chastisement in this world in addition to the greater chastisement (of the Hereafter); perhaps they will retract (from their transgression)
  32,22,And who is more unjust than he who is given good counsel through the Signs of his Lord and yet he turns away from them? Surely We will exact full retribution from such criminals
  32,23,Verily We bestowed the Book upon Moses. So entertain no doubt if (the Prophet Muhammad) received the same. We had made that Book a guidance for the Children of Israel
  32,24,"and when they remained steadfast and firmly believed in Our Signs, We created among them leaders who guided people by Our command"
  32,25,Surely your Lord will judge among them on the Day of Resurrection concerning the matters about which the Children of Israel used to differ
  32,26,Did (these historical events) not make them realise that We destroyed many nations before them amidst whose dwellings they now move about? Surely there are many Signs in this. Are they unable to hear
  32,27,"Have they not seen that We drive water to the parched land, thereby bringing forth crops which they and their cattle eat? Are they unable to see"
  32,28,"They say: “If you are truthful, (tell us) when will the Judgement come?”"
  32,29,"Tell them: “If the unbelievers were to believe on the Day of Judgement that will not avail them. For then they will be granted no respite.”"
  32,30,So (leave them to themselves and) turn away from them and wait; they too are waiting
