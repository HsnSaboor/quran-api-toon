quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  52,32,"Do their minds prompt them to say such things, or are they a people immersed in transgression?”"
  52,33,"Do they say: “He has himself fabricated the Qur'an?” No; the truth is that they are altogether averse to believing"
  52,34,"(If they are truthful in this), then let them produce a discourse of similar splendour"
  52,35,Did they come into being without any creator? Or were they their own creators
  52,36,Or is it they who created the heavens and the earth? No; the truth is that they lack sure faith
  52,37,Or do they have your Lord's treasures in their keeping? Or have absolute authority over them
  52,38,"Or do they have a ladder whereon they can climb and attempt to listen (to what is transpiring in the Higher Realm)? Then, let any of them who has listened to it produce a clear proof of it"
  52,39,Or does Allah have daughters whereas you have sons
  52,40,Or is it that you ask of them any recompense so that they should fear to be weighed down under the burden of debt
  52,41,Or is it that they have access to (the Truths in) the realm beyond sense-perception which they are writing down
  52,42,"Or are they contriving a stratagem against you? If so, that stratagem will rebound against the unbelievers"
  52,43,Do they have any god other than Allah? Exalted be Allah above whatever they associate (with Him in His Divinity)
  52,44,"(So obstinate are they that) even if they were to see some fragments of the sky falling down they would still say: “It is only a mass of cloud.”"
  52,45,So leave them alone until they encounter that Day of theirs when they shall be struck down
  52,46,"when their stratagem shall be of no avail to them, nor shall they be succoured"
  52,47,Surely a chastisement awaits the wrong-doers even before the coming of that Day; but most of them do not know
  52,48,"Be patient, then, (O Prophet), until the judgement of your Lord comes. For surely you are before Our eyes. And celebrate the praise of your Lord when you rise"
  52,49,"and also celebrate His praise at night, and at the retreat of the stars"
