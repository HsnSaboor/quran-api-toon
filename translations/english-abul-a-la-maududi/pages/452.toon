quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you that you make such strange judgements
  37,155,Will you then not take heed
  37,156,Do you have any clear authority for such claims
  37,157,"Bring your Book, if you are truthful"
  37,158,They have established a kinship between Allah and the angels; and the angels know well that these people will be arraigned (as culprits)
  37,159,"(They say): “Exalted be Allah above what they attribute to Him"
  37,160,all of them except the chosen servants of Allah
  37,161,So you and your deities
  37,162,shall not be able to tempt anyone away from Allah
  37,163,except him who shall roast in the Blazing Fire
  37,164,"As for us, there is none but has an appointed station"
  37,165,Verily we range ourselves in rows (as humble servants)
  37,166,and we are of those who glorify Allah.”
  37,167,They used to say before
  37,168,“If only we had the Reminder which had been granted to the people of yore
  37,169,we would surely have been Allah's chosen servants.”
  37,170,"But when it came to them, they rejected it. They shall soon come to know (the end of such an attitude)"
  37,171,We have already given Our promise to Our Messengers
  37,172,that they shall certainly be succoured
  37,173,and that Our hosts shall triumph
  37,174,"So, (O Prophet), leave them alone for a while"
  37,175,"and see, and soon they too shall see"
  37,176,Do they seek to hasten Our chastisement
  37,177,"When that chastisement will descend upon their courtyard, evil shall that Day be for those who had been warned"
  37,178,Leave them alone for a while
  37,179,and see; and they too shall soon see
  37,180,"Exalted be your Lord, the Lord of Glory, above what they attribute to Him"
  37,181,and peace be upon the Messengers
  37,182,"and all praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe"
