quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,39,Permission (to fight) has been granted to those for they have been wronged. Verily Allah has the power to help them
  22,40,"those who were unjustly expelled from their homes for no other reason than their saying: \"Allah is Our Lord.\" If Allah were not to repel some through others, monasteries and churches and synagogues and mosques wherein the name of Allah is much mentioned, would certainly have been pulled down. Allah will most certainly help those who will help Him. Verily Allah is Immensely Strong, Overwhelmingly Mighty"
  22,41,"(Allah will certainly help) those who, were We to bestow authority on them in the land, will establish Prayers, render Zakah, enjoin good, and forbid evil. The end of all matters rests with Allah"
  22,42,"(O Prophet), if they give the lie to you, then before them the people of 'Ad and Thamud, also gave the lie (to the Prophets)"
  22,43,and so too did the people of Abraham and the people of Lot
  22,44,"and so did the dwellers of Midian, and Moses too was branded a liar. Initially I granted respite to the unbelievers for a while and then seized them. How dreadful was My punishment"
  22,45,"How many towns have We destroyed because their people were steeped in iniquity: so they lie fallen down upon their turrets! How many wells lie deserted; and how many towering palaces lie in ruins"
  22,46,Have they not journeyed in the land that their hearts might understand and their ears might listen? For indeed it is not the eyes that are blinded; it is rather the hearts in the breasts that are rendered blind
