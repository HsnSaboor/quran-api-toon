  54,29,"Eventually, they summoned their companion, and he undertook the (outrageous) task and hamstrung the she-camel"
  54,30,So how awesome were My chastisement and My warnings
  54,31,"Behold, We sent a single Blast against them, and they became like the trampled twigs of a sheep pen-builder"
  54,32,"Surely We have made this Qur'an easy as a reminder. Is there, then, any who will take heed"
  54,33,Lot's people also gave the lie to the warnings
  54,34,"and behold, We let loose upon them a tempest which rained stones upon them, except upon Lot's household whom We rescued in the last hours of the night"
  54,35,as a favour from Us. Thus do We reward those who give thanks
  54,36,"Surely Lot warned his people that We shall seize them (with Our chastisement), but they doubted the warnings"
  54,37,"Then they even solicited his guests from him, whereupon We blotted out their eyes, (telling them): “Now have a taste of My chastisement and My warnings.”"
  54,38,Indeed an abiding chastisement came upon them in the morning
  54,39,So have a taste of My chastisement and My warnings
  54,40,"Surely We have made this Qur'an easy as a reminder. Is there, then, any who will take heed"
  54,41,Warnings also came to the Pharaonites
  54,42,"but they gave the lie to Our Signs, to all of them. Thereupon We seized them with the seizing of the Most Mighty, the Most Powerful"
  54,43,Are your unbelievers (of Makkah) any better than they? Or have you been granted any immunity in the Scriptures
  54,44,"Or do they say: “We are a strong legion, strong enough for victory?”"
  54,45,Soon shall this legion be routed and shall turn their backs and flee
  54,46,"Nay; the Hour of Doom is their appointed time, and the Hour shall be more calamitous and bitter"
  54,47,The evil-doers are victims of error and madness
  54,48,"There shall come a Day when they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire and will be told: “Now taste the flame of Hell.”"
  54,49,We have created everything in a determined measure
