quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,45,Allah knows your enemies better and Allah suffices as a protector and Allah suffices as a helper
  4,46,"Among those who have become Jews there are some who alter the words from their context, and make a malicious play with their tongues and seek to revile the true faith. They say: 'We have heard and we disobey' (sami'na wa 'asayna), 'Do hear us, may you turn dumb' (isma' ghayr musma') and 'Hearken to us' (ra'ina). It would indeed have been better for them and more upright if they had said: 'We have heard and we obey' (sami'na wa ata'na) and: 'Do listen to us, and look at us (with kindness)' (wa isma' wa unzurna). But Allah has cursed them because of their disbelief. Scarcely do they believe"
  4,47,"O you who have been granted the Book! Do believe in what We have (now) revealed, which confirms the revelation which you already possess. Do this before We alter countenances, turning them backwards, or lay a curse upon them as We cursed the Sabbath-men. Bear in mind that Allah's command is done"
  4,48,"Surely Allah does not forgive that a partner be ascribed to Him, although He forgives any other sins for whomever He wills. He who associates anyone with Allah in His divinity has indeed forged a mighty lie and committed an awesome sin"
  4,49,"Have you not seen those who boast of their righteousness, even though it is Allah Who grants righteousness to whomsoever He wills? They are not wronged even as much as the husk of a date-stone (if they do not receive righteousness)"
  4,50,See how they forge lies about Allah! This in itself is a manifest sin
  4,51,"Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Book was given? They believe in baseless superstitions and taghut (false deities), and say about the unbelievers that they are better guided than those who believe"
