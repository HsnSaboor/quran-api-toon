quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,"and that “among us some are Muslims (Those who have submitted to Allah), and some of us are deviant. So those who became Muslims found the Right Course"
  72,15,"but those who deviated from the Truth, will be the fuel for Hell.”"
  72,16,"If people were to keep firmly to the Right Way, We would have vouchsafed them abundant rain"
  72,17,"so that We might try them through this bounty. Whoso turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, He will cause him to suffer a grievous chastisement"
  72,18,"and that “mosques belong to Allah, so do not invoke anyone with Him”"
  72,19,"and when Allah's servant stood up to call on Him, they well-nigh swarmed him"
  72,20,"Say, (O Prophet): “I call on my Lord alone, and I do not associate aught with Him in His Divinity.”"
  72,21,"Say: “Surely neither it is in my power to hurt you nor to bring you to the Right Way.”"
  72,22,"Say: “None can protect me from Allah, nor can I find a refuge apart from Him"
  72,23,"(My task is no more than) to deliver Allah's proclamation and His messages. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, surely the Fire of Hell awaits him; therein he will abide in perpetuity.”"
  72,24,"(They shall not change their ways) until they see that against which they had been warned, and then they will know whose helpers are weaker and whose supporters are fewer in number"
  72,25,"Say: “I know not whether what you are promised is near or whether my Lord will prolong its term"
  72,26,"He is the Knower of the Unseen, and He does not disclose His Unseen to anyone"
  72,27,"other than to a Messenger whom He chooses (for the bestowal of any part of the knowledge of the Unseen), whereafter He appoints guards who go before him and behind him"
  72,28,so that He may know that they have delivered the messages of their Lord. He encompasses in His knowledge their surroundings and keeps a count of all things.”
