quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,The intercession of the intercessors shall then be of no avail to them
  74,49,What is the matter with people that they are turning away from this Exhortation
  74,50,as though they were frightened wild asses
  74,51,fleeing from a lion
  74,52,No indeed; each one of them desires that open letters be sent to each of them
  74,53,No indeed; the truth is that they have no fear of the Hereafter
  74,54,Nay; this is an Exhortation
  74,55,"So, whoever wills may benefit from it"
  74,56,But they will not benefit from it unless Allah Himself so wills. He is worthy to be feared; and He is worthy to forgive (those that fear Him)
  75,1,"Nay, I swear by the Day of Resurrection"
  75,2,"and nay, I swear by the self-reproaching soul"
  75,3,Does man imagine that We will not be able to bring his bones together again
  75,4,Yes indeed; We have the power to remould even his finger-tips
  75,5,But man desires to persist in his evil ways
  75,6,"He asks: “When will the Day of Resurrection be?”"
  75,7,When the sight is dazed
  75,8,and the moon is eclipsed
  75,9,and the sun and the moon are joined together
  75,10,"on that Day will man say: “Whither the refuge?”"
  75,11,"No, there is no refuge"
  75,12,With your Lord alone will be the retreat that Day
  75,13,"On that Day will man be apprised of his deeds, both the earlier and the later"
  75,14,"But lo, man is well aware of himself"
  75,15,even though he might make up excuses
  75,16,"(O Prophet), do not stir your tongue hastily (to commit the Revelation to memory)"
  75,17,Surely it is for Us to have you commit it to memory and to recite it
  75,18,"And so when We recite it, follow its recitation attentively"
  75,19,then it will be for Us to explain it
