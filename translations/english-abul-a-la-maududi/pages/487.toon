quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  42,32,And of His Signs are the ships that sail in the sea like mountains
  42,33,"If He so wills, He can cause the winds to become still so that they will remain motionless on its surface. Surely there are many Signs in this for those who are wont to be steadfast and give thanks"
  42,34,"He may, while forgiving much of the sins of those that ride these ships, drown them on account of some of their misdeeds"
  42,35,Then those who wrangle about Our Signs will come to know that there is no escape for them
  42,36,That which has been given to you is only the wherewithal of the transient life of this world. But that which is with Allah is better and more enduring for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord
  42,37,"who eschew grave sins and shameful deeds, and whenever they are angry, forgive"
  42,38,"who obey their Lord and establish Prayer; who conduct their affairs by consultation, and spend out of what We have bestowed upon them"
  42,39,"who, when a wrong is done to them, seek its redress"
  42,40,"The recompense of evil is evil the like of it. But he who forgives and makes amends, his reward lies with Allah. Surely He does not love the wrong-doers"
  42,41,There is no blame against him who avenges himself after he has been wronged
  42,42,Blame attaches only to those who subject people to wrong and commit excesses on earth. A painful chastisement awaits them
  42,43,"But he who patiently endures and forgives, that is a conduct of great resolve"
  42,44,"He whom Allah lets go astray, none after Him can be his protector. You will see that when the wrong-doers observe the chastisement, they will exclaim: “Is there any way to go back?”"
