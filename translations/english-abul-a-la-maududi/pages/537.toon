quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,that this indeed is a noble Qur'an
  56,78,inscribed in a well-guarded Book
  56,79,which none but the pure may touch
  56,80,a revelation from the Lord of the Universe
  56,81,"Do you, then, take this discourse in light esteem"
  56,82,and your portion in it is simply that you denounce it as false
  56,83,"Why, then, when the soul leaps up to the throat"
  56,84,the while you are helplessly watching that he is on the verge of death
  56,85,"– at that moment when We are closer to him than you, although you do not see (Us)"
  56,86,if you are not subject to anyone's authority
  56,87,why are you then not able to bring them back to life if you are truthful
  56,88,So if he is one of those who are near-stationed (to Allah)
  56,89,then happiness and delight and Gardens of Bliss are his
  56,90,And if he is one of the People on the Right
  56,91,"he will be welcomed by the words: “Peace to you” from the People on the Right"
  56,92,And if he is one of those who give the lie (to this Message) and go astray
  56,93,then he will be served boiling water
  56,94,and will be scorched by the Fire
  56,95,That indeed is the absolute truth
  56,96,So glorify the name of your Great Lord
  57,1,"All that is in the heavens and the earth extols the glory of Allah. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Wise"
  57,2,"His is the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death, and He has power over everything"
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last, and the Manifest and the Hidden, and He has knowledge of everything"
