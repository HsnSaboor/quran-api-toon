quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  22,47,They ask you to hasten the punishment. Allah shall most certainly not fail His promise; but a Day with your Lord is as a thousand years of your reckoning
  22,48,"How many towns did I respite at first though they were steeped in iniquity, and then I seized them! To Me are all destined to return"
  22,49,"Say (O Muhammad): \"O people! I have been sent to you only as a plain warner (before the Doom strikes you)"
  22,50,So those who believe and act righteously shall be granted forgiveness and an honourable sustenance
  22,51,"whereas those who strive against Our Signs, seeking to profane them, they are the friends of the Fire"
  22,52,"Never did We send a Messenger or a Prophet before you (O Muhammad), but that whenever he had a desire, Satan interfered with that desire. Allah eradicates the interference of Satan and strengthens His Signs. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  22,53,"(He does this) in order that He may make the evil caused by Satan a trial for those in whose hearts there is sickness (of hypocrisy), whose hearts are hard (and vitiated). Surely these wrong-doers have gone too far in their dissension"
  22,54,(He also does this) in order that those endowed with knowledge may know that it is the Truth from your Lord and that they may have faith in it and their hearts may humble themselves before Him. Verily Allah always directs those that believe to the Right Way
  22,55,"The unbelievers will not cease to be in doubt about it until the Hour suddenly comes upon them, or the chastisement of an ominous day overtakes them"
