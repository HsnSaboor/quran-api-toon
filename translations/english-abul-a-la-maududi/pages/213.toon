quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"Ask them: 'Is there any among those whom you associate with Allah in His divinity who brings about the creation of all beings in the first instance and will then repeat it?' Tell them: 'It is Allah Who brings about the creation of all beings and will then repeat it. How are you, then, being misled"
  10,35,"Ask them: 'Are there among ones whom you associate with Allah in His divinity those who can guide to the truth? Say: 'It is Allah alone Who guides to the truth.' Then, who is more worthy to be followed - He Who guides to the truth, or he who cannot find the right way unless others guide him to it? What is wrong with you? How ill do you judge"
  10,36,Most of them only follow conjectures; and surely conjecture can be no substitute for truth. Allah is well aware of whatever they do
  10,37,And this Qur'an is such that it could not be composed by any unless it be revealed from Allah. It is a confirmation of the revelation made before it and a detailed exposition of the Book. Beyond doubt it is from the Lord of the universe
  10,38,"Do they say that the Messenger has himself composed the Qur'an? Say: 'In that case bring forth just one surah like it and call on all whom you can, except Allah, to help you if you are truthful"
  10,39,"In fact they arbitrarily rejected as false whatever they failed to comprehend and whose final sequel was not apparent to them. Likewise had their predecessors rejected the truth, declaring it falsehood. Do observe, then, what was the end of the wrong-doers"
  10,40,Of those some will believe and others will not. Your Lord knows best the mischief-makers
  10,41,"And if they reject you as false, tell them: 'My deeds are for myself and your deeds for yourselves. You will not be held responsible for my deeds, nor I for your deeds"
  10,42,"Of them some seem to give heed to you; will you, then, make the deaf hear even though they understand nothing"
