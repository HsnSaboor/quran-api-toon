quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  8,17,"So the fact is that it was not you, but it was Allah Who killed them; and it was not you when you threw [sand at them], but it was Allah Who threw it, (and the believers were employed for the task) that He might cause the believers to successfully pass through this test. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
  8,18,"This is His manner of dealing with you. As for the unbelievers, Allah will surely undermine their designs"
  8,19,"(Tell the unbelievers:) 'If you have sought a judgement, then surely a judgement has come to you. And if you desist from disobedience, it is all the better for you. But if you revert to your mischief, We will again chastise you; and your host, howsoever numerous, will never be of any avail to you. Know well, Allah is with the believers"
  8,20,Believers! Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn away from him after you hear his command
  8,21,"And do not be like those who say: 'We hear', though they do not hearken"
  8,22,"Indeed the worst kind of all beasts in the sight of Allah are the people that are deaf and dumb, and do not understand"
  8,23,"And had Allah known in them any good He would surely, have made them hear; but (being as they, are) even if He made them hear, they would have surely turned away in aversion"
  8,24,"Believers! Respond to Allah, and respond to the Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life. Know well that Allah stands between a man and his heart, and it is to Him that all of you shall be mustered"
  8,25,And guard against the mischief that will not only bring punishment to the wrong-doers among you. Know well that Allah is severe in punishment
