quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  27,64,"Who creates first then reverts it? And who gives you provision from the heavens and the earth? Is there any other god along with God? Tell them: \"Bring your proof, if you are truthful"
  27,65,"Say: \"No one in the heavens and the earth has knowledge of the unknown except God, nor can they know when they will be raised again"
  27,66,"Still less do they comprehend the life to come. In fact they are in doubt about it. Still more, they are blind to it"
  27,67,"Those who do not believe, say: \"When we and our fathers have turned to dust, how shall we be raised again"
  27,68,Indeed we and our fathers had been promised this before. It is nothing but the earlier people's lore
  27,69,"Say: \"Travel in the land and see how (bad) was the end of sinners"
  27,70,"Do not grieve over them, and do not be distressed by what they contrive"
  27,71,"Yet they say: \"When will this promise come to pass? (Tell Us) if you speak the truth"
  27,72,"Say: \"Perhaps some of what you wish to hasten is right behind you"
  27,73,"Verily your Lord is gracious to men, though most men are ungrateful"
  27,74,Verily your Lord knows what lies hidden in their breasts and what they disclose
  27,75,There is nothing of the hidden in the heavens and the earth that is not recorded in the luminous Book
  27,76,Indeed this Qur'an explains to the children of Israel much of what they are at variance
