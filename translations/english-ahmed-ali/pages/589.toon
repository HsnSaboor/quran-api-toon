quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,Regarding them from their cushioned seats
  83,36,Will not the infidels pay for what they had done
  84,1,WHEN THE SKY is cleft asunder
  84,2,And hearkens to its Lord and is dutiful
  84,3,When the earth is stretched out taut
  84,4,And throws out whatever it contains and is empty
  84,5,And hearkens to its Lord and is dutiful
  84,6,"O man, you have to strive and go on striving towards your Lord, then will you meet Him"
  84,7,And he who is given his ledger in his right hand
  84,8,Will have an easy reckoning
  84,9,And will return to his people full of joy
  84,10,But he who is given his ledger from behind his back
  84,11,Will pray for death
  84,12,But will be roasted in the fire
  84,13,He lived rejoicing among his people
  84,14,Never thinking he will return
  84,15,Why not? His Lord was always watching him
  84,16,So indeed I call to witness the evening twilight
  84,17,And the night and all it gathers
  84,18,And the moon when at the full
  84,19,That you will climb from stage to stage
  84,20,"So, wherefore do they not believe"
  84,21,And when the Qur'an is recited to them do not bow in adoration
  84,22,In fact the unbelievers disavow
  84,23,But God knows what they harbour in their breasts
  84,24,So give them news of painful punishment
  84,25,"Except those who believe and do the right: For them there is reward unending"
