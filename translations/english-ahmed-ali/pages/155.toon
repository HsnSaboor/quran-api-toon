quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,38,"Enter then the Fire,\" will God say, \"with the past generations of jinns and men.\" On entering each batch will condemn the other; and when all of them shall have entered one after the other, the last to come will say of those who had come before them: \"O our Lord, they are the ones who led us astray; so give them double chastisement in the Fire.\" He will answer: \"For all it will be double; but this you do not know"
  7,39,"Then the former will say to the latter: \"You have no privilege over us. So taste the punishment for what you had done"
  7,40,"Verily for those who deny Our signs and turn away in haughtiness from them, the gates of heaven shall not be opened, nor will they enter Paradise, not till the camel passes through the needle's eye. That is how We requite the transgressors"
  7,41,For them is a flooring of Hell and a covering (of fire). That is how We requite the iniquitous
  7,42,"As for those who believe and do good, We never burden a soul beyond capacity. They are men of Paradise where they will abide for ever"
  7,43,"Whatever the rancour they may have in their hearts We shall (cleanse and) remove. Streams of running water shall ripple at their feet, and they will say: \"We are grateful to God for guiding us here. Never would we have been guided if God had not shown us the way. The apostles of our Lord had indeed brought the truth.\" And the cry shall resound: \"This is Paradise you have inherited as meed for your deeds"
