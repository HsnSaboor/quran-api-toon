quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,1,I CALL TO witness those who stand arrayed in rows
  37,2,And those who restrain by reprimanding
  37,3,And those who recite the Reminder
  37,4,Verily your God is One
  37,5,"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, and the Lord of the Easts"
  37,6,He decked the nearest heavens with ornaments of stars
  37,7,Protecting them against every wayward devil
  37,8,"So that they are not able to listen to the angels of higher (echelons), and are pelted from all sides"
  37,9,And kept far away. There is perpetual punishment for them
  37,10,Except those who eavesdrop and are pursued by a shooting flame
  37,11,"So ask them if they are more difficult to create, or the rest We have created? Indeed (man) We created from fermented clay"
  37,12,"Yet while you are filled with wonder, they just scoff"
  37,13,And when they are warned they pay no heed
  37,14,"When they see a sign, they laugh at it"
  37,15,"And say: \"This is only magic"
  37,16,"When we are dead and turned to dust and bones, how can we be raised again"
  37,17,And our fathers too
  37,18,"You say: \"Yes; and you will be lowly made"
  37,19,"There will only be a single jerk, and they will gape"
  37,20,"And say: \"Ah woe! This is the Day of Reckoning"
  37,21,"(Yes,) this is the Day of Judgement you had called a lie"
  37,22,"Gather all the wicked together and their comrades, and those they had worshipped"
  37,23,"Other than God,\" (the angels will be told), \"then show them the way to Hell"
  37,24,"And detain them, for they will be questioned"
