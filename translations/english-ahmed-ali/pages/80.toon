quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,15,"If any of your women is guilty of unnatural offence, bring four of your witnesses to give evidence; if they testify against them, retain them in the houses until death overtakes them or God provides some other way for them"
  4,16,"If two (men) among you are guilty of such acts then punish both of them. But if they repent and reform, let them be, for God accepts repentance and is merciful"
  4,17,"God does accept repentance, but only of those who are guilty of an evil out of ignorance yet quickly repent, and God turns to them again, for God is all-knowing and all-wise"
  4,18,"But (He does not accept) the repentance of those who continue indulging in evil until death draws near and they say: \"We now repent;\" nor of those who die disbelieving. For them We have a grievous retribution in wait"
  4,19,"O believers, you are not allowed to take perforce the women (of dead relatives) into your heritage, or tyrannise over them in order to deprive them of what you have given them, unless they are guilty of open adultery. Live with them with tolerance and justice even if you do not care for them. For it may well be you may not like a thing, yet God may have endued it with much goodness"
