quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,103,"Yet We know what they say: \"It is only a man who instructs him.\" The speech of the man they imply is obscure while this is clear Arabic"
  16,104,Those who do not believe in the words of God are verily not guided by God. For them is severe punishment
  16,105,"They alone invent lies who do not believe in the words of God, and they are liars"
  16,106,Whosoever denies having once believed -- unless he is forced to do so while his heart enjoys the peace of faith -- and opens his mind to disbelief will suffer the wrath of God. Their punishment will be great
  16,107,For they loved the life of this world more than the life to come; and God does not guide those who do not believe
  16,108,They are the ones whose hearts and ears and eyes have been sealed by God; and these are the heedless
  16,109,They will surely be losers in the life to come
  16,110,"But (to) those who were victimised and left their homes and then fought and endured patiently, your Lord will surely be forgiving and kind"
