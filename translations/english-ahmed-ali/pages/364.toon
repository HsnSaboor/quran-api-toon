quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,44,Or do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are no better than cattle; in fact they are farther astray from the path
  25,45,Have you not seen how your Lord lengthens out the shadow? He could have kept it motionless if He liked. Yet We make the sun its pilot to show the way
  25,46,"Then We draw it back to Us, withdrawing it little by little"
  25,47,"It is He who made the night a covering for you; and made sleep for rest, the day for rising"
  25,48,It is He who sends the winds with auspicious news in advance of His benevolence; and We send pure water down from the sky
  25,49,"To quicken a region that was dead, and to give it as drink to animals We have created and to men in plenty"
  25,50,And We distribute it among them in various ways that they may ponder and reflect; yet most men disdain everything but denial and thanklessness
  25,51,Had We pleased We could have raised a warner in every town
  25,52,"So do not listen to unbelievers, and strive against them with greater effort"
  25,53,"It is He who made two bodies of water flow side by side, one fresh (and) sweet, the other brine (and) bitter, and has placed an interstice, a barrier between them"
  25,54,"It is He who created man from water, then gave him consanguinity and affinity. Your Lord is omnipotent"
  25,55,And yet they worship besides God what cannot bring them gain or do them harm. The unbeliever has always been an auxiliary against his Lord
