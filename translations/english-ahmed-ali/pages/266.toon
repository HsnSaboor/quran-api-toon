quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  15,71,"Here are my daughters,\" said Lot, \"if you are so active"
  15,72,Verily by your life they were utterly confused in their (lustful) drunkenness
  15,73,So they were seized by the mighty blast at break of day
  15,74,"And We turned the city upside down, and rained on them stones of hardened lava"
  15,75,Herein are really signs for those who discern
  15,76,This (city) lies on a road that still survives
  15,77,Indeed there is a portent in this for those who believe
  15,78,The dwellers of the Wood (near Midian) were also wicked
  15,79,"So We punished them too. They are both situated by the highway, clearly visible"
  15,80,The people of Al-Hijr denied Our apostles
  15,81,And though We had given them Our signs they turned away from them
  15,82,They used to hew dwellings in the mountains to live in security
  15,83,But they were seized by the mighty blast towards the morning
  15,84,And all that they had done (for security) availed them nothing
  15,85,We have not created but with reason the heavens and the earth and all that lies within them. The Hour (of the great change) is certain to come. So turn away (from them) with a grace
  15,86,Surely your Lord is the Creator and knows (everything)
  15,87,"We have indeed given you the seven oft-repeated (examples), and the majestic Qur'an"
  15,88,"So covet not things We have bestowed on a portion of them to enjoy, and do not grieve for them, and protect those who believe"
  15,89,"And say: \"I am a distinct warner"
  15,90,Like (those) We had sent to those schismatics who slandered their Books
