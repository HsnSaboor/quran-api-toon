  55,44,They will go round and around between it and boiling water
  55,45,Which of the favours of your Lord will you then deny
  55,46,"But for him who lived in awe of the sublimity of his Lord, there will be two gardens"

  55,48,Full of overhanging branches
  55,49,Which of the favours of your Lord will you then deny
  55,50,With two springs of water flowing through them both
  55,51,Which of the favours of your Lord will then both of you deny

  55,64,Of darkest verdant green
  55,65,How many favours of your Lord will then both of you deny
  55,66,With two fountains gushing constantly
  55,67,How many favours of your Lord will then both of you deny
