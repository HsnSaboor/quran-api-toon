quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,HE FROWNED AND turned away
  80,2,Because a blind man came to him
  80,3,What made you think that he will not grow in virtue
  80,4,"Or be admonished, and the admonition profit him"
  80,5,As for him who is not in want of any thing
  80,6,You pay full attention
  80,7,Though it is not your concern if he should not grow (in fulness)
  80,8,As for him who comes to you striving (after goodness)
  80,9,And is also fearful (of God)
  80,10,You neglect
  80,11,Assuredly this is a reminder
  80,12,For any one who desires to bear it in mind
  80,13,(Contained) in honoured pages
  80,14,Exalted and holy
  80,15,In the hands of scribes
  80,16,Noble and pious
  80,17,Accursed is man. How ungrateful is he
  80,18,Of what substance God created him
  80,19,"From a single sperm He created, then proportioned him"
  80,20,Then made his passage easy (at birth)
  80,21,He will then send him to death and have him laid in the grave
  80,22,Then He will raise him up again when He please
  80,23,But no. He has not fulfilled what was enjoined on him
  80,24,Let man therefore consider (the sources of) his food
  80,25,We poured down rain abundantly
  80,26,Then We cracked the earth open under pressure (of germination)
  80,27,And We made corn grow
  80,28,And grapes and herbage
  80,29,Olives and dates
  80,30,Orchards thick with trees
  80,31,And fruits and fodder
  80,32,A provision for you and your cattle
  80,33,But when the great calamity comes
  80,34,Man will fly from his brother
  80,35,Mother and father
  80,36,As well as his wife and children
  80,37,Each man will have enough cares that day
  80,38,Many faces will that day be bright
  80,39,Laughing and full of joy
  80,40,And many will be dust-begrimed
  80,41,Covered with the blackness (of shame)
  80,42,"They will be the unbelievers, transgressors"
