quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What ails you that you judge in such a wise
  37,155,Why do you not reflect
  37,156,Or have you received some clear authority
  37,157,"Then bring your scripture, if what you say is true"
  37,158,"They link Him with jinns by lineage, yet the jinns know they will be brought before Him"
  37,159,God is too glorious for what they ascribe to Him
  37,160,Except His chosen creatures who do not
  37,161,So neither you nor those you worship
  37,162,Can mislead anyone away from Him
  37,163,Except one who is (destined) to burn in Hell
  37,164,"There is not one of us who does not have his appointed place,\" (declare the angels)"
  37,165,And we are truly those who stand in rows
  37,166,And we are those who sing hallelujas to Him
  37,167,They used to say
  37,168,If we had the account of earlier people with us
  37,169,We would have been the chosen creatures of God
  37,170,Yet now (that it has come) they refuse to believe in it; but they will come to know soon
  37,171,"Our word had already been given before to Our votaries, the apostles"
  37,172,That they would be helped
  37,173,And that certainly Our armies will be victorious
  37,174,So you ignore them for a time
  37,175,And wait; they will come to know soon
  37,176,Do they want to hasten Our punishment
  37,177,"When it comes down on their plains, it will be an evil dawn for those who had been warned"
  37,178,So turn away from them for a time
  37,179,And watch; they will come to know soon
  37,180,"Too glorious is your Lord, the Lord of power, for what they ascribe to Him"
  37,181,So peace be on the messengers
  37,182,"And all praise to God, the Lord of all the worlds"
