quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,75,"What has come upon you that you fight not in the cause of God and for the oppressed, men, women and children, who pray: \"Get us out of this city, O Lord, whose people are oppressors; so send us a friend by Your will, and send us a helper"
  4,76,"Those who believe fight in the way of God; and those who do not, only fight for the powers of evil; so you should fight the allies of Satan. Surely the stratagem of Satan is ineffective"
  4,77,"Have you not seen the people who were told: \"Hold back your hands (from attacking), observe your devotional obligations and pay the zakat?\" But when they were commanded to fight, behold, a section among them were filled with fear of men as though it were the fear of God and even more, and said: \"O Lord, why did you make war compulsory for us? Why did you not allow us to live a little more?\" Say to them: \"How short-lived is the commerce of this world; but that of the next is best for those who fear God; and you will not be wronged the breadth of a thread"
  4,78,"Death will overtake you wheresoever you be, even in the mightiest of towers. Yet if some good comes their way they say: \"It is from God;\" and if it is evil that befalls them, they say: \"It is indeed from you.\" Say to them: \"Every thing is from God.\" O, what has come upon the people that even this they fail to understand"
  4,79,What comes to you of good is verily from God; and what comes to you of ill is from your own self (your actions). We have sent you as apostle to all mankind; and God is sufficient as witness
