quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,That this is indeed the glorious Qur'an
  56,78,(Inscribed) in the well-kept Book
  56,79,Only they can reach it who are clean (of mind)
  56,80,It has been revealed by the Lord of all the worlds
  56,81,Then why do you dissimulate this Revelation
  56,82,You live by calling it a lie
  56,83,Then how is it that when the (dying) breath is withdrawn into the throat (and rattles)
  56,84,And you wait for the moment (of death)
  56,85,"We are closer to him than you, even though you cannot see"
  56,86,"Then why, if you are not indebted (to Us for life)"
  56,87,Can you not bring him back? (Answer) if you are truthful
  56,88,"Then, if he is one of the honoured"
  56,89,"There will be peace and plenty, and gardens of tranquility for him"
  56,90,If he is of those of the right hand
  56,91,"There will be the salutation by those of the right hand: \"Peace on you"
  56,92,But if he is of the deniers and the errants
  56,93,The welcome will be boiling water
  56,94,And the roasting in Hell
  56,95,This is indeed the ultimate truth
  56,96,"Then praise your Lord, the most supreme"
  57,1,WHATSOEVER IS IN the heavens and the earth sings the praises of God. He is all-mighty and all-wise
  57,2,"His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, He is the giver of life and death, and He has power over everything"
  57,3,"He is the first and He the last, the transcendent and the immanent; and He has knowledge of everything"
