quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,195,"The Lord heard their prayer and answered: \"I suffer not the good deeds of any to go waste, be he a man or a woman: The one of you is of the other. And those who were deprived of their homes or banished in My cause, and who fought and were killed, I shall blot out their sins and admit them indeed into gardens with rippling streams.\" -- A recompense from God, and the best of rewards is with God"
  3,196,Be not deceived by the comings and goings of unbelievers in the land
  3,197,"Their commerce is but short-lived, and then their abode shall be Hell: And what an evil abode"
  3,198,"But those who are pious and obedient to their Lord, will have gardens with streams of running water where they will abide as guests of God; and what is with God is best for the pious"
  3,199,"Certainly among the people of the Book are some who believe in God and in what has been revealed to you and had been revealed to them; and they bow in humility before God, and do not trade for paltry gain the signs of God. Their reward is verily with their Lord; and swift is the reckoning of God"
  3,200,"So you who believe, have endurance in suffering, be patient and persevere, strengthen each other and be firm, and be pious and fear God that you may find success"
