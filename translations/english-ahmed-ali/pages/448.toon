quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"Who used to say: 'Are you one of those who can testify to the truth"
  37,53,(Do you think) we would be paid back our due when we are dead and reduced to dust and bones
  37,54,"He said: 'Will you look down"
  37,55,He looked down and saw (his friend) in the midst of Hell
  37,56,"By God', he said, 'you had almost ruined me"
  37,57,Had it not been for the grace of my Lord I too would have been there (in Hell)
  37,58,"(Another will say:)\"Is it true, we are not going to die"
  37,59,"Other than our first death, and we shall not be punished"
  37,60,This will indeed be great happiness
  37,61,For this the toilers should strive
  37,62,Is this better or the tree of Zaqqum
  37,63,Which We have reserved as punishment for evil-doers
  37,64,It is a tree that grows at the bottom of Hell
  37,65,Its spathes are like the prickly pear
  37,66,They will eat and fill their bellies with it
  37,67,Washing it down with boiling water
  37,68,Then to Hell they will surely be returned
  37,69,They had found their fathers astray
  37,70,Yet they hasten to follow in their footsteps
  37,71,So had many an earlier people gone astray
  37,72,And We had sent admonishers to them
  37,73,"Look, then how was the end of those who had been warned"
  37,74,Other than the chosen creatures of God
  37,75,Noah had verily called to Us. And how gracious was He who answered (him)
  37,76,We saved him and his family from the great affliction
