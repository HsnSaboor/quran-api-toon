  40,41,"O my people, what is wrong with me that I am calling you to preservation, while you invite me to the Fire"
  40,42,"You are asking me to disbelieve in God, and to associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, yet I invite you to the all-mighty, all-forgiving"
  40,43,"What you are calling me to is surely not worth the calling in this world or in the next, because our returning is to God; and because the transgressors will be inmates of Hell"
  40,44,You will remember what I say in time to come; I submit my case to the judgement of God. Surely God keeps an eye on His creatures

  40,47,"As they will noisily argue in the Fire, the weaker ones will say to the arrogant: \"We were your followers, so will you take over some of our share of the fire"
  40,48,"The arrogant will answer: \"All of us are in it. Surely God has judged between His creatures"
  40,49,"Those in the Fire will say to the warders of Hell: \"Ask your Lord to reduce the punishment by a day for us"
