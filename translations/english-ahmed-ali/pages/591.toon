quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,I CALL TO witness the heavens and the night Star
  86,2,How will you comprehend what the night star is
  86,3,It is the star that shines with a piercing brightness
  86,4,That over each soul there is a guardian
  86,5,Let man consider what he was made of
  86,6,He was created of spurting water
  86,7,Issuing from (the pelvis) between the backbone and the ribs
  86,8,God has certainly power to bring him back (from the dead)
  86,9,The day all secrets are examined
  86,10,He will have no strength or helper
  86,11,So I call to witness the rain-producing sky
  86,12,And the earth which opens up (with verdure)
  86,13,That this (Qur'an) is a decisive word
  86,14,And no trifle
  86,15,They are hatching up a plot
  86,16,But I too am devising a plan
  86,17,"So bear with unbelievers with patience, and give them respite for a while"
  87,1,"GLORIFY THE NAME of your Lord, most high"
  87,2,Who creates and proportions
  87,3,Who determines and directs
  87,4,Who brings out the pastures
  87,5,Then reduces them to rusty rubbish
  87,6,We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it
  87,7,Unless God may please. He knows the visible and knows what is hidden
  87,8,We shall take you slowly towards ease
  87,9,So remind them if reminder is profitable
  87,10,Those who fear will understand
  87,11,Only the wretch will turn aside
  87,12,Who will burn in the terrible Fire
  87,13,In which he will neither die nor live
  87,14,Surely he will succeed who grows in goodness
  87,15,And recites the name of his Lord and serves with devotion
