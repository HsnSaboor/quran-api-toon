quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,7,Men have a share in what the parents and relatives leave behind at death; and women have a share in what the parents and relatives leave behind. Be it large or small a legal share is fixed
  4,8,"And when the relatives and orphans and the needy collect at the time of the division (of property) provide for them too, and talk kindly to them"
  4,9,"Let people fear the day when they leave small children behind them unprovided, and how concerned they would be for them. So fear God and say the right things to them"
  4,10,"Those who devour the possessions of the orphans unjustly devour only fire, and will surely burn in Hell"
  4,11,"As for the children, God decrees that the share of the male is equivalent to that of two females. If they consist of women only, and of them more than two, they will get two-thirds of the inheritance; but in case there is one, she will inherit one half. The parents will each inherit a sixth of the estate if it happens the deceased has left a child; but if he has left no children, and his parents are his heirs, then the mother will inherit one-third; but if he has left brothers, the mother will inherit one-sixth after payment of legacies and debts. Of parents and children you do not know who are more useful to you. These are the decrees of God who knows all and is wise"
