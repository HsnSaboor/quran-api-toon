quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,I CALL TO witness the star of the pleiades when it has dipped
  53,2,"That your companion is not confused, nor has he gone astray"
  53,3,Neither does he speak of his own will
  53,4,This is only revelation communicated
  53,5,Bestowed on him by the Supreme Intellect
  53,6,Lord of power and wisdom. So he acquired poise and balance
  53,7,And reached the highest pinnacle
  53,8,Then he drew near and drew closer
  53,9,Until a space of two bow (arcs) or even less remained
  53,10,When He revealed to His votary what He revealed
  53,11,His heart did not falsify what he perceived
  53,12,Will you dispute with him what he saw
  53,13,He saw Him indeed another time
  53,14,By the Lote-tree beyond which none can pass
  53,15,Close to which is the Garden of Tranquility
  53,16,When the Lote-tree was covered over with what it was covered over
  53,17,Neither did sight falter nor exceed the bounds
  53,18,Indeed he saw some of the greatest signs of His Lord
  53,19,Have you considered Lat and 'Uzza
  53,20,"And Manat, the other third (of the pagan deities)"
  53,21,"Are there sons for you, and daughters for Him"
  53,22,This is certainly an unjust apportioning
  53,23,"These are only names which you and your fathers have invented. No authority was sent down by God for them. They only follow conjecture and wish-fulfilment, even though guidance had come to them already from their Lord"
  53,24,Can ever man get what he desires
  53,25,To God belong the End and the Beginning
  53,26,Many as the angels be in heaven their intercession will not avail in the least without God's permission for whomsoever He please and approve
