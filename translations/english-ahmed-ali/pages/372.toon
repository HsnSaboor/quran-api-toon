  26,112,"He said: \"It is not for me to know what they were doing"
  26,113,"It is for my Lord to bring them to book, if you can understand"
  26,114,I am certainly not one to drive away the believers
  26,115,I am only a plain admonisher
  26,116,"They said: \"If you do not desist, O Noah, you will be stoned to death"
  26,117,"He prayed: \"O Lord, verily my people accuse me of lies"
  26,118,"So adjudge between me and them conclusively, and save me and the believers who are with me"
  26,119,So We delivered him and those with him in the loaded ark
  26,120,And drowned the rest of them
  26,121,"Verily there is a sign in this, yet many of them do not believe"

  26,126,So fear God and listen to me
  26,127,I ask no recompense of you for it. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds

  26,131,So be fearful of God and follow me
  26,132,Fear Him who has bestowed on you what you know
  26,133,Gave you increase of cattle and sons
  26,134,And orchards and springs
  26,135,I fear the punishment of a terrible day for you
  26,136,"They said: \"It is the same to us if you warn us or do not warn"
