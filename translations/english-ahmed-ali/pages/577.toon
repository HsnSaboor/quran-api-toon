quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,"So, the intercession of intercessors will not avail them"
  74,49,Why then do they turn away from the admonition
  74,50,As though they were frightened asses
  74,51,Fleeing from a lion
  74,52,In fact every one of them wants to be given open books (like the prophets)
  74,53,By no means. In fact they do not fear the Hereafter
  74,54,"Never so, as this is a reminder"
  74,55,Let him then who heeds remember it
  74,56,"But they will not remember except as God wills: He is worthy to be feared, and He is worthy of forgiving"
  75,1,I CALL TO WITNESS the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,And I call the reprehensive soul to witness
  75,3,Does man think We shall not put his bones together
  75,4,Surely We are able to reform even his finger-tips
  75,5,Yet man is sceptical of what is right before him
  75,6,"He asks: \"When will the Day of Resurrection be"
  75,7,Yet when the eyes are dazzled
  75,8,The moon eclipsed
  75,9,And the sun and moon are conjoined
  75,10,"That day man will say: \"Where can I find escape"
  75,11,"Never so, for there will be no escape"
  75,12,With your Lord alone will be the retreat on that day
  75,13,Then man will be told what he had sent ahead (of good) and what he had left behind
  75,14,In fact man is a witness against himself
  75,15,Whatever the excuses he may offer
  75,16,Do not forestall (the revelation before its completion) by acting in haste
  75,17,Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility
  75,18,"So, as We recite it, follow its reading"
  75,19,The exposition of its meaning surely rests on Us
