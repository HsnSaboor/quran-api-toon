quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,135,"They say: \"Become Jews or become Christians, and find the right way.\" Say: \"No. We follow the way of Abraham the upright, who was not an idolater"
  2,136,"Say: \"We believe in God and what has been sent down to us, and what had been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their progeny, and that which was given to Moses and Christ, and to all other prophets by the Lord. We make no distinction among them, and we submit to Him"
  2,137,"If they come to believe as you did, they will find the right path. If they turn away then they will only oppose; but God will suffice you against them, for God hears all and knows everything"
  2,138,We have taken the colouring of God; and whose shade is better than God's? Him alone we worship
  2,139,"Say: \"Why do you dispute with us about God when He is equally your Lord and our Lord? To us belong our actions, to you yours; and we are true to Him"
  2,140,"Or do you claim that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their offspring were Jews or Christians? Say: \"Have you more knowledge than God?\" Who is more wicked than he who conceals the testimony he received from God? God is not unaware of all you do"
  2,141,"They were the people, and they have passed away. Theirs the reward for what they did, as yours will be for what you do. You will not be questioned about their deeds"
