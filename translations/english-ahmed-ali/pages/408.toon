quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  30,33,When misfortune befalls men they pray to their Lord and turn to Him; but afterwards when He has given them a taste of His benevolence a section of them begins to ascribe compeers to their Lord
  30,34,So as to deny what We have given them. Please yourselves for a time; you will come to know soon
  30,35,Have We sent down a charter to them which mentions what they associate with Him
  30,36,"When We give men a taste of Our benevolence they start rejoicing in it. When misfortune befalls them as a result of what they have done themselves, they begin to despair"
  30,37,Do they not see God increases or decreases the means of whosoever He please? Verily there are signs in this for those who believe
  30,38,"So, give their share to the relatives, the needy, and the wayfarers. This is best for those who seek the way that leads to God, and they will be successful"
  30,39,"What you give on interest to increase (your capital) through others' wealth, does not find increase with God; yet what you give (in alms and charity) with a pure heart, seeking the way of God, will be doubled"
  30,40,"It is God who created you, then gave you sustenance, then He will make you die, and bring you back to life. Is there one among those you associate with Him who can do the least of these things? Too high and exalted is He for what they associate with Him"
  30,41,"Corruption has spread over land and sea from what men have done themselves that they may taste a little of what they have done: They may haply come back (to the right path)"
