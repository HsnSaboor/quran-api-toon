quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Did We not create you from contemptible water
  77,21,Then We lodged you in a secure place (the womb)
  77,22,For a certain appointed time
  77,23,Then We facilitated (your birth). How well do We calculate
  77,24,Alas the woe that day for those who deny
  77,25,Have We not made the earth a repository
  77,26,For the living and the dead
  77,27,"And placed in it lofty and broad stablisers, and gave you sweet water to drink"
  77,28,Alas the woe that day for those who deny
  77,29,Go to what you used to deny
  77,30,Go to the shadow with three ramifications
  77,31,Neither shady nor protecting against the blazing Fire
  77,32,It will throw out sparks as logs of wood
  77,33,So like golden camels
  77,34,Alas the woe that day for those who deny
  77,35,They will not be able to speak that day
  77,36,Nor given leave to make excuses
  77,37,Alas the woe that day for those who deny
  77,38,That will be the Day of Reckoning. Gathered will be (you) and the earlier (generations)
  77,39,"So if you have any plot to devise against Me, then devise it"
  77,40,Alas the woe that day for those who deny
  77,41,"Those who take heed for themselves and fear God, will be amidst shade and springs of water"
  77,42,And such fruits as they desire
  77,43,Eat and drink with relish as reward for what you had done
  77,44,That is how We reward the good
  77,45,Alas the woe that day for those who deny
  77,46,"Eat and enjoy for a while: You are certainly sinners"
  77,47,Alas the woe that day for those who deny
  77,48,"When it is said to them: \"Bow in homage,\" they do not bow"
  77,49,Alas the woe that day for those who deny
  77,50,In what other lore after this will they then believe
