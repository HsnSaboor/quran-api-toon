quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,"That He created pairs, male and female"
  53,46,From a drop of semen when emitted
  53,47,That the second creation is incumbent on Him
  53,48,That it is He who makes you rich and contented
  53,49,That He is the Lord of Sirius
  53,50,That it was He who destroyed the 'Ad of old
  53,51,"And Thamud, and did not leave them"
  53,52,"Like the people of Noah before them, who were surely oppressors and rebellious"
  53,53,And He overthrew the Cities of the Plain
  53,54,So that they were covered over by what they were covered over
  53,55,How many favours of your Lord will you then deny
  53,56,He who warns you is one of the warners of old
  53,57,What is to come is imminent
  53,58,There is no one to unveil it apart from God
  53,59,Are you astonished at this news
  53,60,And keep laughing and do not weep
  53,61,Indulging in pleasantries
  53,62,Bow instead in adoration before God and worship Him
  54,1,THE HOUR HAS come and split is the moon
  54,2,"But if they see a sign they turn away, and say: \"This is the same old lie continuing"
  54,3,"And deny, and follow their own vain desires; but every matter is determined at its time"
  54,4,Messages deterring them from evil had come to them
  54,5,Containing consummate wisdom; yet warnings were of no avail
  54,6,So turn away from them. When on the Day the crier calls to the painful business
