quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,OF WHAT ARE they asking one another
  78,2,(Is it) of the great announcement
  78,3,About which they have been differing
  78,4,Indeed they will come to know soon
  78,5,They will indeed come to know soon
  78,6,Did We not make the earth a spreading
  78,7,The mountains tent-pins
  78,8,We created you in pairs
  78,9,And made sleep for you to rest
  78,10,The night a covering
  78,11,And the day for seeking livelihood
  78,12,We raised over you several secure (skies)
  78,13,And placed a lamp therein brightly burning
  78,14,And We sent down rain from water-laden clouds pouring in torrents
  78,15,That We may produce from it grain and vegetation
  78,16,And orchards full of trees and interlacing boughs
  78,17,Surely a time is fixed for the Day of Judgement
  78,18,The day the trumpet blast is sounded you will come in hordes
  78,19,The heavens will be opened wide and turn into so many doors
  78,20,The mountains put in motion turning into a mirage
  78,21,Certainly Hell lies in wait
  78,22,The rebels' abode
  78,23,Where they will remain for aeons
  78,24,Finding neither sleep nor any thing to drink
  78,25,Except boiling water and benumbing cold
  78,26,A fitting reward
  78,27,They were those who did not expect a reckoning
  78,28,And rejected Our signs as lies
  78,29,We have kept account of everything in a book
  78,30,"So taste (the fruit of what you sowed), for We shall add nothing but torment"
