quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,I CALL TO witness the sun and his early morning splendour
  91,2,And the moon as she follows in his wake
  91,3,The day when it reveals his radiance
  91,4,The night when it covers him over
  91,5,The heavens and its architecture
  91,6,The earth and its spreading out
  91,7,The soul and how it was integrated
  91,8,And given the faculty of knowing what is disruptive and what is intrinsic to it
  91,9,He who nourishes it will surely be successful
  91,10,And he who confines it will surely come to grief
  91,11,The Thamud denied (the truth) in their perverseness
  91,12,When among them the great wretch arose
  91,13,"And the apostle of God had to tell them: \"This is God's she-camel, let her drink"
  91,14,"But they called him a liar and hamstrung her. So God obliterated them for their crime, and (destroyed) all of them alike"
  91,15,He does not fear the consequence
  92,1,I CALL THE night to witness when it covers over
  92,2,And the day when it shines in all its glory
  92,3,And Him who created the male and female
  92,4,That your endeavour is for different ends
  92,5,Yet he who gives to others and has fear
  92,6,And affirms goodness
  92,7,We shall ease the way of fortune for him
  92,8,But he who does not give and is unconcerned
  92,9,And rejects goodness
  92,10,For him We shall ease the way of adversity
  92,11,And his riches will not avail him when he falls headlong (into the Abyss)
  92,12,It is indeed for Us to show the way
  92,13,And to Us belong the End and the Beginning
  92,14,"So, I warn you of the blazing Fire"
