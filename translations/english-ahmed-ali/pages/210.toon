quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,15,"When Our clear messages are recited to them, those who do not hope to meet Us, say: \"Bring a different Qur'an, or make amendments to this one.\" Say: \"It is not for me to change it of my will. I follow (only) what is revealed to me. If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of an awful Day"
  10,16,"Say: \"Had God pleased I would never have recited it to you, nor would He have given you comprehension of it. (Remember that I am one of you) and have lived a whole life with you before (its revelation). Even then you do not understand"
  10,17,Who is more unjust than he who imputes lies to God or denies His revelations? The sinners will surely not be reprieved
  10,18,"They worship those besides God who cannot do them harm or bring them gain, and say: \"These are our intercessors with God.\" Say: \"Do you want to inform God of things in the heavens and the earth He does not know?\" Glorious is He, and too exalted for what they associate with Him"
  10,19,"Men were once a community of one faith; but they differed (and followed different ways). Had it not been for the word proclaimed by your Lord before, their differences would have been resolved"
  10,20,"They say: \"How is it that no sign was sent by his Lord (to His Prophet)?\" Tell them: \"Unknown things are only known to God. So watch and wait (for the sign); I am waiting and expecting with you"
