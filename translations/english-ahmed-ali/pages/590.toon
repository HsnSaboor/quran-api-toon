quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  85,1,I CALL TO witness the sky (bespangled) with the signs of the Zodiac
  85,2,And the promised day
  85,3,And the witness and the witnessed
  85,4,That accursed are the men of the trench
  85,5,Full of fire fed by faggots
  85,6,As they sat around it
  85,7,Witnessing what they had done to the believers
  85,8,"They had no other reason for hating them except that they believed in God the mighty, worthy of praise"
  85,9,Whose kingdom spreads over the heavens and the earth. God is witness over everything
  85,10,"Surely for those who persecute believers, men and women, and do not repent afterwards, is the punishment of Hell, and the punishment of burning"
  85,11,Surely for those who believe and do the right are gardens with rivers running by. That is the greatest success
  85,12,The grip of your Lord is severe indeed
  85,13,It is verily He who initiates and repeats
  85,14,He is the forgiving and the loving
  85,15,The Lord of the glorious Throne
  85,16,Who does as He pleases
  85,17,Has the story of the hordes
  85,18,Of Pharaoh and Thamud come to you
  85,19,Yet the infidels persist in denial
  85,20,But God surrounds them from all sides
  85,21,This is indeed the glorious Qur'an
  85,22,(Preserved) on the guarded tablet
