quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,53,"Thus do We try men through one another so that they may ask: \"Are these the ones of all of us who have been favoured by God?\" Does God not know who are the grateful"
  6,54,"When those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say to them: \"Peace on you.\" Your Lord has prescribed grace for Himself, so that in case one of you commits evil out of ignorance, then feels repentant and reforms, He may be forgiving and kind"
  6,55,Thus distinctly do We explain Our signs that the way of sinners may become distinct
  6,56,"Tell them: \"I am forbidden to worship those you invoke apart from God.\" And say: \"I will not follow your wishes. If I do, I shall be lost and not be one of those who follow the right path"
  6,57,"Tell them: \"A clear proof has come to me from my Lord, and Him you deny. But what you wish to be hastened is not within my power. The judgement is only God's. He unfolds the Truth, and is the best of judges"
  6,58,"Say: \"If what you wish to be hastened were in my power, all matters between you and me would have been settled; God is cognisant of those who are unjust"
  6,59,"He has the keys of the Unknown. No one but He has knowledge; He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls without His knowledge, nor a grain in the darkest (recess) of the earth, nor any thing green or seared that is not recorded in the open book (of nature)"
