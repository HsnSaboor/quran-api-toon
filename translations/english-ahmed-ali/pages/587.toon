  82,1,WHEN THE SKY is split asunder
  82,2,And the stars dispersed
  82,3,When the oceans begin to flow
  82,4,When the graves are overturned
  82,5,Each soul will know what it had sent ahead and what it had left behind
  82,6,"O man, what seduced you from your munificent Lord"
  82,7,"Who created you then formed your symmetry, then gave you right proportion"
  82,8,Shaping you into any form He pleased
  82,9,Even then you deny the Judgement
  82,10,Surely there are guardians over you
  82,11,Illustrious scribes
  82,12,Who know what you do
  82,13,The pious will surely be in heaven
  82,14,The wicked certainly in Hell
  82,15,They will burn in it on the Day of Judgement
  82,16,And will not be removed from it
  82,17,How can you comprehend what the Day of Judgement is
  82,18,How then can you comprehend what the Day of Judgement is
  82,19,"It is the day when no soul will have power to do the least for a soul, and God's alone will be done"

  83,2,Who insist on being given full when they take from others
  83,3,"Whilst when they measure or weigh for them, give less"

  83,5,On a grievous day
  83,6,The day all mankind will stand before the Lord of all the worlds
