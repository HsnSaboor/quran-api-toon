quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,The people of Lot accused the messengers of lies
  26,161,"When their brother Lot said to them: \"Will you not take heed"
  26,162,I have been sent as a trusted messenger to you
  26,163,So fear God and listen to me
  26,164,I ask no recompense of you for this. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds
  26,165,Why do you go for males unlike all other creatures
  26,166,Leaving the consorts your Lord has made for you? But you are a people who exceed the bounds
  26,167,"They said: \"If you do not desist, O Lot, you will be expelled (from the city)"
  26,168,"(Lot) said: \"I am disgusted with your actions"
  26,169,"(And prayed:) \"O Lord, save me and my family from what they do"
  26,170,So We saved him and his whole family
  26,171,Except one old woman who remained behind
  26,172,Then We destroyed the rest of them
  26,173,And rained on them a shower (of Stones). How terrible was the rain (that fell) on those who had been warned
  26,174,"Verily in this was a sign, but most of them do not believe"
  26,175,Yet surely your Lord is mighty and powerful
  26,176,The people of the Wood too called the messengers liars
  26,177,"When Shu'aib said to them: \"Will you not take heed"
  26,178,I have been sent as a trusted messenger to you
  26,179,So fear God and follow me
  26,180,I ask no recompense of you for this. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds
  26,181,Give full measure and do not cheat
  26,182,Weigh on an even balance
  26,183,"And do not withhold from people what belongs to them, and do not corrupt the land"
