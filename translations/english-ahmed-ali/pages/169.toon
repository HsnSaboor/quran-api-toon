quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,150,"When Moses returned to his people, indignant and grieved, he said: \"How wickedly you behaved in my absence. Why must you hasten the decree of your Lord?\" And he cast aside the tablets, and pulled his brother by the hair. \"O son of my mother,\" said (Aaron), \"these people took advantage of my weakness and almost killed me. Do not let my enemies rejoice at my plight, and do not put me down among transgressors"
  7,151,"(Moses) said: \"O Lord, forgive me and my brother, and admit us to Your grace, for You are the most compassionate of all"
  7,152,"Surely those who have taken the calf (as a god) will suffer the anger of their Lord, and disgrace in the world. That is how We requite those who fabricate lies"
  7,153,"Yet those who do wrong, then repent and believe, are forgiven, for your Lord is forgiving and kind"
  7,154,When his anger subsided Moses picked up the tablets. Inscribed on them was guidance and grace for those who fear their Lord
  7,155,"Moses chose seventy of his people for the appointment (on Mount Sinai). When they arrived they were seized by a tremor. (Moses) said: \"O Lord, if You had so pleased You could have annihilated them and me before this. Will You destroy us for something the foolish among us have done? This is but a trial from You whereby You will lead whom You will astray and guide whom You please. You are our saviour, so forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are the best of forgivers"
