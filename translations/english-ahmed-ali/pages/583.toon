quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,"As for those who preserve themselves from evil and follow the straight path, there is attainment for them"
  78,32,Orchards and vineyards
  78,33,And graceful maidens of the same age
  78,34,And flasks full and flowing
  78,35,They will hear no blasphemies there or disavowals
  78,36,"A recompense from your Lord, a sufficient gift"
  78,37,"The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that lies between them, most benevolent, to whom none may dare address a word"
  78,38,"The day the Spirit takes its stand, with the angels ranged in rows. None will speak except who is permitted by Ar-Rahman and says what is right"
  78,39,That day is certain. So whosoever likes may prepare a way to his Lord
  78,40,"We have indeed warned you of a calamity near at hand, a day when man will see what he had sent (of his deeds) ahead, and the unbeliever will say: \"Woe alas. Ah would that I were dust"
  79,1,I CALL TO WITNESS those who dive and drag
  79,2,And those who undo the bonds gently
  79,3,And those who glide swimmingly
  79,4,Then outpace the others swiftly
  79,5,And direct affairs by command
  79,6,The day the convulsive (first blast) shatters convulsively
  79,7,Followed by the second blast
  79,8,Hearts will pound loudly on that day
  79,9,Eyes be lowered in submission
  79,10,"They say: \"Shall we go back to our original state"
  79,11,After having turned to carious bones
  79,12,"They say: \"Then this returning will be a dead loss"
  79,13,It will only be a single blast
  79,14,And they will wake up suddenly
  79,15,Has the story of Moses come to you
