quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,Of what avail shall their enjoyment be to them
  26,208,Never have We destroyed a habitation till We had sent admonishers to them
  26,209,To warn. For We are never unjust
  26,210,The devils did not bring it down
  26,211,"They are not worthy of it, nor have they power"
  26,212,They have been precluded from hearing it
  26,213,"So call on no other god but God, lest you are condemned to torment"
  26,214,And warn your near relations
  26,215,And take those believers under your wing who follow you
  26,216,"If they do not obey you, tell them: \"I am not responsible for what you do"
  26,217,"Have trust in the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,218,Who watches you when you get up
  26,219,And your movements among those who bow in homage to God
  26,220,He is all-hearing and all-knowing
  26,221,Should I tell you on whom the devils descend
  26,222,They come down to every mendacious sinner
  26,223,Who listens to you (for spreading rumours); but most of them are liars
  26,224,"As for the poets, only those who go astray follow them"
  26,225,Have you not seen that they wander distract in every valley
  26,226,And they say what they do not do
  26,227,"Except those who believe and do the right, and remember God a great deal, who retaliate only when they have been wronged. Yet the oppressors will now come to know through what reversals they will be overthrown"
