quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"They denied him, and will surely be brought to punishment"
  37,128,Except the chosen creatures of God
  37,129,And We left his (memory) for posterity
  37,130,Peace be on Elias
  37,131,That is how We reward those who do good
  37,132,He is truly among Our faithful devotees
  37,133,Verily Lot was one of the apostles
  37,134,Wherefore We saved him and his entire family
  37,135,Except an old woman who was one of those who stayed behind
  37,136,Then We destroyed the others
  37,137,You pass by (their habitations) in the morning
  37,138,Or at night. Then how is it you do not understand
  37,139,Verily Jonah is one of the apostles
  37,140,When he fled on the laden ship
  37,141,"And lots were cast (when a storm overtook them), he was rejected, (and thrown overboard)"
  37,142,Then he was swallowed by a large fish as he was worthy of blame
  37,143,Had he not been one of those who struggled hard
  37,144,He would have stayed in its belly till the day the dead are raised
  37,145,"So We cast him, sick, on a barren shore"
  37,146,And We made a gourd tree grow over him
  37,147,We sent him to a hundred thousand men or more
  37,148,And they came to believe; so We allowed them to enjoy the good things of life for an age
  37,149,"Now ask them if their Lord has daughters, and they sons"
  37,150,"Or did We make the angels females, and they witnessed it"
  37,151,Is it not a lie invented by them when they say
  37,152,"God has begotten (children)?\" They are liars indeed"
  37,153,Does He prefer sons to daughters
