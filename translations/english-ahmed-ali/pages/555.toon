quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"When you tell them: \"Come, let the Apostle of God ask forgiveness for you,\" they turn their heads, and you see them turning away with arrogance"
  63,6,"Whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask, it is all the same; God will not forgive them. Surely God does not show a disobedient people the way"
  63,7,"They are the ones who say: \"Do not spend on those who are with the Apostle of God till they break away (from him).\" To God belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the hypocrites do not understand"
  63,8,"They say: \"If we now go back to Madina, the stronger will turn the weaker out.\" But power belongs to God, His Apostle and the faithful, though the hypocrites do not know"
  63,9,"O you who believe, let not your wealth and children make you negligent of the remembrance of God. Those who do so will be losers"
  63,10,"Spend of what We have given you before death comes to one of you, when he will say: \"O Lord, why did you not defer my term for a while that I could give alms and be among the doers of good"
  63,11,But God does not grant a soul respite once its term has come to end. And God is aware of what you do
