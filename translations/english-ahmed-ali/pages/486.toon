  42,27,If God were to give in abundance to His creatures they would fill the earth with oppression. So He gives according to measure as He will. He knows (what is good for) His creatures. He is all-aware and all-seeing
  42,28,"It is He who sends down rain when they had despaired of it, and showers His benevolence. He is the protector worthy of praise"
