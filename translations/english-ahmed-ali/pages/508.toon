  47,12,"Verily God will admit those who believe and do the right into gardens with streams of water running by. But the unbelievers revel and carouse and subsist like beasts, and Hell will be their residence"
  47,13,"How many were the habitations, mightier than your city which has turned you out, which We destroyed; and they did not have a helper"
  47,14,"Can one who stands on a clear proof from his Lord, be like one enamoured of his evil deeds and follows his inane desires"
  47,15,"The semblance of Paradise promised the pious and devout (is that of a garden) with streams of water that will not go rank, and rivers of milk whose taste will not undergo a change, and rivers of wine delectable to drinkers, and streams of purified honey, and fruits of every kind in them, and forgiveness of their Lord. Are these like those who will live for ever in the Fire and be given boiling water to drink which will cut their intestines to shreds"

  47,19,"Know then, therefore, there is no god but He, and ask forgiveness for your sins and those of believing men and women. God knows your wanderings and your destination"
