  68,46,Do you ask for any compensation from them that they are burdened with want
  68,47,Or do they have knowledge of the unknown which they copy down
  68,48,"So wait with patience for the judgement of your Lord, and do not be like (onah) of the fish who called (to his Lord) when he was choked with anger"

  69,6,And the 'Ad were destroyed by the furious cold blast of roaring wind
  69,7,Which He sent to assail them for seven nights and eight days running. You should have seen the people prostrate like the decayed trunks of date-palm trees
  69,8,Do you see any trace of them
