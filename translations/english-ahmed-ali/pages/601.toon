quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,TIME AND AGE are witness
  103,2,Man is certainly loss
  103,3,"Except those who believe, and do good and enjoin truth on one another, and enjoin one another to bear with fortitude (the trials that befall)"
  104,1,"WOE TO EVERY slanderer, back-biter"
  104,2,Who amasses wealth and hordes it
  104,3,Does he think his wealth will abide for ever with him
  104,4,By no means. He will be thrown into Hutama
  104,5,How will you comprehend what Hutama is
  104,6,It is the fire kindled by God
  104,7,Which penetrates the hearts
  104,8,(And) vaults them over
  104,9,In extending columns
  105,1,HAVE YOU NOT seen how your Lord dealt with the people of the elephants
  105,2,Did He not make their plan go wrong
  105,3,And sent hordes of chargers flying against them
  105,4,(While) you were pelting them with stones of porphyritic lava
  105,5,And turned them into pastured fields of corn
