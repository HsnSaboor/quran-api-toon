quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,Youths of never-ending bloom will pass round to them
  56,18,"Cups and decanters, beakers full of sparkling wine"
  56,19,"Unheady, uninebriating"
  56,20,And such fruits as they fancy
  56,21,Bird meats that they relish
  56,22,And companions with big beautiful eyes
  56,23,Like pearls within their shells
  56,24,As recompense for all they had done
  56,25,They will hear no nonsense there or talk of sin
  56,26,"Other than \"Peace, peace\" the salutation"
  56,27,As for those of the right hand -- how (happy) those of the right hand
  56,28,They will be in (the shade) of thornless lote
  56,29,And acacia covered with heaps of bloom
  56,30,Lengthened shadows
  56,31,Gushing water
  56,32,And fruits numberless
  56,33,"Unending, unforbidden"
  56,34,And maidens incomparable
  56,35,We have formed them in a distinctive fashion
  56,36,And made them virginal
  56,37,Loving companions matched in age
  56,38,For those of the right hand
  56,39,A crowd of earlier generations
  56,40,And a crowd of the later
  56,41,But those of the left hand -- how (unhappy) those of the left hand
  56,42,Will be in the scorching wind and boiling water
  56,43,Under the shadow of thick black smoke
  56,44,Neither cool nor agreeable
  56,45,They were endowed with good things
  56,46,But persisted in that greater sin
  56,47,"And said: \"What! When we are dead and turned to dust and bones, shall we then be raised again"
  56,48,And so will our fathers
  56,49,"Say: \"Indeed, the earlier and the later generations"
  56,50,Will be gathered together on a certain day which is predetermined
