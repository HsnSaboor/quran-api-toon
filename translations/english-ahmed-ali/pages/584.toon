quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,When his Lord called to him in Tuwa's holy vale
  79,17,Go to the Pharaoh who has become refractory
  79,18,"And say: 'Would you like to grow (in virtue)"
  79,19,Then I will guide you to your Lord that you may come to fear Him
  79,20,So he showed him the greater sign
  79,21,But (the Pharaoh) disavowed and disobeyed
  79,22,"Then he turned away, deliberating"
  79,23,And assembled (his council) and proclaimed
  79,24,"Saying: \"I am alone your lord, the highest of them all"
  79,25,So God seized him for the punishment of the Hereafter and this world
  79,26,Truly there is a lesson in this for those who fear (the consequences)
  79,27,Are you more difficult to create or the heavens? He built it
  79,28,"Raised it high, proportioned it"
  79,29,"Gave darkness to its night, and brightness to its day"
  79,30,And afterwards spread out the earth
  79,31,He brought out its water and its pastures from it
  79,32,And stabilized the mountains
  79,33,As convenience for you and your cattle
  79,34,When the great calamity comes
  79,35,The day when man remembers all that he had done
  79,36,And Hell made visible to him who can see
  79,37,Then he who had been rebellious
  79,38,And who preferred the life of the world
  79,39,Will surely have Hell for his abode
  79,40,"But he who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained his self from vain desires"
  79,41,Will surely have Paradise for abode
  79,42,"They ask you: \"When will the Hour be? When is its time fixed"
  79,43,What do you have to do with explaining it
  79,44,The extent of its knowledge goes to your Lord
  79,45,Your duty is only to warn him who fears it
  79,46,"The day they see it, it will seem they had stayed in the world but only an evening or its turning into dawn"
