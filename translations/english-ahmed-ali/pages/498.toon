quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  44,40,The Day of Judgement is your promised day of meeting
  44,41,"The day when friend will help no friend in the least, nor will they be helped"
  44,42,Apart from those to whom God is kind. He is all-mighty and all-merciful
  44,43,The tree of Zaqqum will indeed be
  44,44,The food of sinners
  44,45,It is like pitch. It will fume in the belly
  44,46,As does boiling water
  44,47,"Seize him and drag him into the depths of Hell,\" (it will be said)"
  44,48,Then pour over his head the torment of scalding water
  44,49,"Taste it,\" (they will be told). \"You were indeed the mighty and noble"
  44,50,This is certainly what you had denied
  44,51,Surely those who fear and follow the straight path will be in a place of peace and security
  44,52,In the midst of gardens and of springs
  44,53,"Dressed in brocade and shot silk, facing one another"
  44,54,Just like that. We shall pair them with companions with large black eyes
  44,55,They will call for every kind of fruit with satisfaction
  44,56,"There they will not know any death apart from the first death they had died, and will be kept safe from the torment of Hell"
  44,57,By the beneficence of your Lord. This will be the great success
  44,58,Therefore We have made this (Qur'an) easy in your tongue. They may haply take a warning
  44,59,So you wait. They are also waiting
