quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  27,45,"We sent to Thamud their brother Saleh (who said): \"Worship God.\" But they were divided into two groups disputing with one another"
  27,46,"(Saleh) said: \"O people, why do you wish to hasten evil rather than good? Why not ask for God's forgiveness? You may well be forgiven"
  27,47,"They said: \"You betoken evil, and those with you.\" (Saleh) replied: \"The evil you presage can only come from God. In reality you are a people under trial (for your own inauspiciousness)"
  27,48,"There were in that city nine persons who spread disorder in the land, and did not reform"
  27,49,"They said: \"Let us swear by God that we will attack Saleh and his family at night, and later tell his heirs: 'We did not see his family destroyed, and we speak the truth"
  27,50,They hatched up the plot; We also planned without their knowledge
  27,51,"Now see the end of their machinations: We destroyed them and their entire people"
  27,52,So these their habitations lie deserted now because of their iniquities. Verily there is a sign in this for those who understand
  27,53,We deliver those who believe and take heed for themselves
  27,54,"(Remember) Lot, when he said to his people: \"Why do you indulge in obscenities when you know (it is evil)"
  27,55,You lust after men in place of women. You are indeed a stolid people
