quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,"But no, you prefer the life of the world"
  87,17,Though the life to come is better and abiding
  87,18,This is surely in the earlier Books
  87,19,The Books of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,HAS NEWS OF the Overpowering Event reached you
  88,2,Many faces will be contrite on that day
  88,3,"Labouring, wearied out"
  88,4,Burning in the scorching fire
  88,5,Given water from the boiling spring to drink
  88,6,They will have no food except bitter thorn
  88,7,Neither nourishing nor banishing hunger
  88,8,Many faces will be joyous on that day
  88,9,Well-pleased with their endeavour
  88,10,In the high empyrean
  88,11,Never hearing idle talk
  88,12,There is a stream of running water in it
  88,13,And within it are couches placed on high
  88,14,Goblets set
  88,15,Cushions arranged
  88,16,And rich carpets spread
  88,17,Do they not then ponder how the clouds were formed
  88,18,"And the heavens, how it was raised high"
  88,19,"And the mountains, how they were fixed"
  88,20,"And the earth, how it was spread out"
  88,21,Remind them; you are surely a reminder
  88,22,You are not a warden over them
  88,23,Other than him who turns his back and denies
  88,24,In which case he will be punished by God with the severest punishment
  88,25,To Us is surely their returning
  88,26,Ours is surely then to reckon with them
