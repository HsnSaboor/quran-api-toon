quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,That is why he has no friend today
  69,36,Nor food other than suppuration (filth)
  69,37,Which none but the hellish eat
  69,38,"So, I call to witness what you see"
  69,39,And what you do not see
  69,40,That this is indeed the word of the noble Messenger
  69,41,And not the word of a poet. How little is it that you believe
  69,42,Nor is it the word of a soothsayer. Little is it that you reflect
  69,43,It has been sent down by the Lord of all the worlds
  69,44,Had he attributed falsely any words to Us
  69,45,We would have seized him by his right hand
  69,46,Then cut off his aorta
  69,47,And not one of you would have been able to stop (Us)
  69,48,It is really a reminder for those who fear God and follow the straight path
  69,49,We certainly know that some among you do deny it
  69,50,It is surely the nemesis of unbelievers
  69,51,"And He, He is indeed the ultimate Reality"
  69,52,"So glorify your Lord, the most supreme"
  70,1,AN INQUIRER ASKED for the affliction that is to come

  70,3,"From God, the Lord of the steps (of progression)"
  70,4,"To whom the angels and the soul take a day to ascend, whose length is fifty thousand years"
  70,5,So persevere with becoming patience
  70,6,They surely take it to be far away
  70,7,But We see it very near
  70,8,The day the sky becomes like molten brass
  70,9,The mountains like the tufts of (carded) wool
  70,10,And no friend inquires after friend
