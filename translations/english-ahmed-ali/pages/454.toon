quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,17,"Bear with patience what they say, and remember Our votary David, man of strength. He surely turned to Us in penitence"
  38,18,We subjugated the chiefs (of tribes) to struggle day and night with him
  38,19,And the levied Tair. They were all obedient to him
  38,20,"So We further strengthened his kingdom, and bestowed wisdom on him, and judgement in legal matters"
  38,21,Have you heard of the litigants who jumped over the wall into his chamber
  38,22,"When they came before David, he was frightened of them. \"Do not be afraid,\" they said. \"The two of us are disputing the wrong one has done the other. So judge between us with equity, and do not be unjust, and guide us to the right path"
  38,23,"This man here is my brother. He has ninety and nine ewes while I have only one. He demands that I should give him my ewe, and wants to get the better of me in argument"
