quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Have you seen him who denies Our revelations, and says: \"I will certainly be given wealth and children"
  19,78,"Has he peeped into the Unknown, or obtained a promise from Ar-Rahman"
  19,79,"Never so. We shall certainly write down what he says, and prolong the extent of his punishment"
  19,80,"All that he claims will revert to Us, and he will come before Us all alone"
  19,81,They have taken other gods apart from God that they might be a strength to them
  19,82,Never. They will deny their devotion and become their adversaries
  19,83,Do you not see that We have set the devils against the infidels to rouse and instigate them
  19,84,"So, do not be hasty with them. We are counting their number (of days)"
  19,85,The day We shall usher the righteous before Ar-Rahman like envoys into the presence of a king
  19,86,And drive the wicked into Hell like cattle driven to water
  19,87,None will have power to intercede for them except one who obtains a promise from Ar-Rahman
  19,88,"They say: \"God has begotten a son"
  19,89,You have uttered a grievous thing
  19,90,"Which would cleave the skies asunder, rend the earth, and split the mountains"
  19,91,For they have attributed a son to Ar-Rahman
  19,92,When it does not behove the Merciful to have a son
  19,93,There is no one in the heavens and the earth but comes before Ar-Rahman in all obedience
  19,94,He has counted them and calculated their number
  19,95,Every one of them will come before Him all alone on the Day of Resurrection
