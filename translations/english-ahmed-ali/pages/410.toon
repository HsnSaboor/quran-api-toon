quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"If We send a (blighting) wind and they see (the earth) seared autumnal, they would surely become ungrateful"
  30,52,You cannot make the dead to listen nor the deaf hear the call when they have turned back and retreated
  30,53,Nor can you make the blind see the way when they have gone astray. You can make none hear except those who believe Our signs and have come to submission
  30,54,"It is God who created you of weakness, then after weakness gave you strength, then after strength will give you weakness and grey hair. Surely He makes whatever He wills. He is all-knowing and all-powerful"
  30,55,"The day Resurrection is set the sinners will swear: \"We did not tarry more than an hour (and cannot be guilty).\" That is how they have always been deceived"
  30,56,"But those who were given the knowledge and belief will say: \"You have tarried, according to the Book of God, as long as the Day of Resurrection, and this is the Day of Resurrection, but 'you do not know"
  30,57,"Their excuses will be of no avail to the sinners on that day, and they will not be allowed to beg for favour"
  30,58,"We have offered every kind of example here in this Qur'an to men. Even then if you bring a verse to them, those who disbelieve say: \"You are nothing but a liar"
  30,59,That is how God seals the hearts of those who do not know
  30,60,So have patience. The promise of God is surely true; and let not those who do not believe make you relax (your endeavours)
