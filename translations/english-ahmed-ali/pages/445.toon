quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  36,71,"Do they not see the cattle among things We have fashioned by Our power, which they own"
  36,72,Whom We made subservient to them so that some of them they ride and some they eat
  36,73,And they derive other advantages and drinks from them. Even then they do not offer thanks
  36,74,And take other gods apart from God that they may perhaps give them help
  36,75,They will not be able to help them and will be brought (to Us) as their levied troops
  36,76,So be not grieved by what they say. We certainly know what they hide and disclose
  36,77,Does not man see We created him from a drop of semen? Even then he becomes an open contender
  36,78,"And applies comparisons to Us, having forgotten his origin, and says: \"Who can put life into decayed bones"
  36,79,"Say: \"He who created you the first time. He has knowledge of every creation"
  36,80,"Who gave you fire from a green tree, with which you ignite the flame"
  36,81,How can He who created the heavens and the earth not be able to create others like them? Why not? He is the real creator all-knowing
  36,82,"When He wills a thing He has only to say: \"Be,\" and it is"
  36,83,"So all glory to Him who holds all power over everything, to whom you will go back in the end"
