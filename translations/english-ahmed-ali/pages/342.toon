quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,THE TRUE BELIEVERS will be successful
  23,2,Who are humble in their service
  23,3,Who shun all frivolities
  23,4,Who strive for betterment
  23,5,Who guard their sex
  23,6,Except from their wives and women slaves of old are free of blame
  23,7,But those who covet more than this will be transgressors
  23,8,And those who fulfil their trusts and keep their promises
  23,9,And those who are watchful of their acts of prayer
  23,10,These are the real gainers
  23,11,"Who will inherit Paradise, and live in it for ever"
  23,12,We created man from the finest extract of clay
  23,13,Then We placed him as a sperm in a firmly established lodging
  23,14,"Then We fashioned the sperm into an embryo, then fashioned the embryo into a shapeless lump of flesh; then from the lump of flesh We fashioned bones, then clothed the bones with flesh. Thus We formed him into a new creation. So blessed be God the best of Creators"
  23,15,And then you will certainly die
  23,16,Then will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection
  23,17,We made several highways one over the other above you. We are not neglectful of creation
