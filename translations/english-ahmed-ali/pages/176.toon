  7,197,While those you beseech apart from Him cannot help you or even help themselves
  7,198,"When you call upon them for guidance, they do not hear. When you think they are looking at you, (in fact) they cannot see"

  7,202,"Even though their (devilish) brothers would like them to continue in error, and would not desist"
  7,203,"And when you do not bring a (Qur'anic) verse to them, they say: \"Why don't you make one up?\" Say: \"I follow only what my Lord reveals to me.\" These (revelations) are an evident proof from your Lord, and a guidance and grace for those who believe"
  7,204,When the Qur'an is recited listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed
