quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Your Lord surely knows that you are occupied with your devotions for nearly two-thirds of the night, or half the night, or one-third of it, as do many others with you. Yet God prescribes the measure of night and day. He knows you cannot calculate it, and so turns to you in benevolence. So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily. He knows some among you will be sick, and some will be travelling over the earth in search of the bounty of God, and some fighting in the way of God. So read as much from it as you can easily, and be firm in devotion, pay the zakat, and lend a goodly loan to God. And what you send for yourself of the good, you will find it with God better and greater in reward. So ask for God's forgiveness. Indeed God is forgiving and kind"
  74,1,O YOU ENFOLDED in your mantle (of reform)
  74,2,Arise and warn
  74,3,Glorify your Lord
  74,4,Purify your inner self
  74,5,And banish all trepidation
  74,6,Do not bestow favours in expectation of return
  74,7,And persevere in the way of your Lord
  74,8,For when the trumpet blows
  74,9,It will be a day of distress
  74,10,Dolorous for the unbelievers
  74,11,Leave him to Me whom I created alone
  74,12,And gave him abundant wealth
  74,13,And sons always present by his side
  74,14,And made things easy for them
  74,15,Yet he wants that I should give him more
  74,16,Never. He is refractory of Our signs
  74,17,I shall inflict on him hardship
