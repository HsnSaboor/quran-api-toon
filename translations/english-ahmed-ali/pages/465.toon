quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  39,57,"Or say: \"If only God had guided me I would have been a man of fear and piety"
  39,58,"Or say on seeing the punishment: \"If I could only return I would be among the good"
  39,59,"Why, My revelations had come to you, but you denied them and were filled with pride, and were among the disbelievers"
  39,60,"If you see those who had imputed lies to God on the Day of Resurrection, black would be their faces (with disgrace). Is there not a place in Hell for the arrogant"
  39,61,God would rescue those who fear Him (and guide them) to places of safety. Neither will evil touch them nor regret
  39,62,"God is the creator of all things, and He is the guarantor of all things"
  39,63,He has the keys of the heavens and the earth; and those who deny the revelations of God will be losers
  39,64,"Say: \"O you ignorant people, do you bid me to worship someone other than God"
  39,65,"Surely you have been commanded, as those before you were: \"If you associate (any one with God), wasted will be all your deeds, arid you will perish"
  39,66,"So, you should worship only God, arid be among the grateful"
  39,67,"They do not esteem God as is rightly due to Him. The whole earth would be a fistful of His on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens would be rolled up in His right hand. Too immaculate is He and too high for what they associate with Him"
