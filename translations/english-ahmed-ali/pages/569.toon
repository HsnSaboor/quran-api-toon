quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,Though within sight of one another. The sinner would like to ransom himself from the torment of that Day by offering his sons
  70,12,His wife and his brother
  70,13,And his family who had stood by him
  70,14,"And all those who are on the earth, to save himself"
  70,15,But never. It is pure white flame
  70,16,That would skin the scalp
  70,17,It will summon whoever turns his back and flees
  70,18,Who amasses and then hoards
  70,19,Surely man is greedy by nature
  70,20,If evil befalls him he is perturbed
  70,21,If good comes to him he holds back his hand
  70,22,Except those who closely follow (the Book of God)
  70,23,Who persevere in devotion
  70,24,In whose wealth a due share is included
  70,25,For the needy and those dispossessed
  70,26,And those who believe in the Day of Judgement
  70,27,And those who fear the punishment of their Lord
  70,28,Surely no one can be secure from the punishment of his Lord
  70,29,And those who guard their sex except from their wives and women slaves of old
  70,30,Are free of blame
  70,31,But those who seek more than this will be transgressors
  70,32,And those who fulfil their trusts and covenants
  70,33,Who uphold their testimonies
  70,34,And those who are mindful of their moral obligations
  70,35,They will live in gardens with honour
  70,36,What is the matter with unbelievers that they stare at you with fixed gazes and hasten towards you
  70,37,"In crowds, right and left"
  70,38,Does every one of them wish to enter the garden of tranquility
  70,39,Never so. We have created them from what they know
