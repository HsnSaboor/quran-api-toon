quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,1,"ALL PRAISE BE to God who created the heavens and the earth, and ordained darkness and light. Yet the unbelievers make the others equal of their Lord"
  6,2,"It is He who created you from clay then determined a term (of life) for you, and a term (is fixed) with Him. Even then you doubt"
  6,3,"He is God in the heavens and the earth. He knows what you hide and bring out into the open, and knows what you earn (of good and evil)"
  6,4,Yet no sign of their Lord comes to them but they turn away from it
  6,5,So they disbelieved the truth when it came to them; but they will soon come to know the reality of what they had ridiculed
  6,6,"Do they not see how many generations We laid low before them, whom We had firmly established in the land as We have not established you, and showered abundant rain on them, and made rivers lap at their feet, yet whom We destroyed for their sins, and raised new generations after them"
  6,7,"Even if We had sent you a transcript on paper which they could feel with their hands, the unbelievers would have said: \"This is nothing but clear sorcery"
  6,8,"They say: \"How is it no angel was sent down to him?\" Had We sent an angel down the matter would have come to end, and they would have had no respite"
