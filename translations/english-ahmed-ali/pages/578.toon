quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,But no. You love this transient life
  75,21,And neglect the Hereafter
  75,22,How many faces will be refulgent on that Day
  75,23,Waiting for their Lord
  75,24,And how many faces on that Day will be woe-begone
  75,25,Fearing that a great disaster is going to befall them
  75,26,"Never so, for when life withdraws into the clavicula"
  75,27,"And it is asked: \"Is there any reciter of charms and amulets"
  75,28,He will then realise it is the parting
  75,29,And anguish will be heaped upon anguish
  75,30,To your Lord then will be the driving
  75,31,For he neither believed nor prayed
  75,32,But only disavowed and turned away
  75,33,Then he strutted back to his people
  75,34,"Alas the woe for you, alas"
  75,35,"Alas, the woe for you"
  75,36,"Does man think that he will be left alone to himself, free"
  75,37,Was he not an emitted drop of semen
  75,38,"Then formed into an embryo? Then He fashioned, shaped and proportioned"
  75,39,"And assigned it sexes, male and female"
  75,40,Cannot such as He bring the dead to life
  76,1,WAS THERE NOT a time in the life of man when he was not even a mentionable thing
  76,2,"Verily We created man from a sperm yoked (to the ovum) to bring out his real substance, then gave him hearing and sight"
  76,3,We surely showed him the way that he may either be grateful or deny
  76,4,We have prepared for unbelievers chains and collars and a blazing fire
  76,5,Surely the devotees will drink cups flavoured with palm blossoms
