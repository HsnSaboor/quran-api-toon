quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,SINCE THE QURAISH have been united
  106,2,United to fit out caravans winter and summer
  106,3,Let them worship the Lord of this House
  106,4,Who provided them against destitution and gave them security against fear
  107,1,HAVE YOU SEEN him who denies the Day of Judgement
  107,2,It is he who pushes the orphan away
  107,3,And does not induce others to feed the needy
  107,4,Woe to those who pray
  107,5,But who are oblivious of their moral duties
  107,6,Who dissimulate
  107,7,And withhold things of common use (from others)
  108,1,HAVE SURELY given you pre-eminence (in numbers and following)
  108,2,So serve your Lord with full dedication and sacrifice
  108,3,It is surely your opponents whose line will come to end
