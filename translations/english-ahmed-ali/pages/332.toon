quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  22,1,"O YOU PEOPLE, fear your Lord. The great upheaval of the Hour will indeed be terrible"
  22,2,"The day you see it every suckling female will forget her suckling, and every pregnant female will discharge her burden. You will see men drunk, yet it will not be intoxication. The torment of God will be severe"
  22,3,"And yet there are men who contend about God without understanding, and follow every wayward devil"
  22,4,"Who, it is inscribed, will beguile whoever follows him, and lead him to the torment of Hell"
  22,5,"If you have any doubt, O men, about being raised to life again, (remember) that We created you from dust, then a drop of semen, then an embryo, then a chewed up lump of flesh shaped and shapeless, that We may reveal (the various steps) to you. We keep what We please in the womb for a certain time, then you come out as a child, then reach the prime of age. Some of you die, some reach the age of dotage when they forget what they knew, having known it once. You see the earth all withered, then We send down rain upon it, and it bestirs itself, swells, and brings forth every kind of beauteous verdure"
