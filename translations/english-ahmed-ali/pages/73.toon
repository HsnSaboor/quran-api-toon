quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,174,"And returned with God's favour and grace without harm, for they attended the pleasure of God; and great is the benevolence of God"
  3,175,"It is no one but Satan who frightens you with his allies. But do not fear him, fear Me, if indeed you are believers"
  3,176,"And do not be grieved by those who rush into disbelief. They do no harm to God; and God will not give them any share in the life to come, and their torment shall be great"
  3,177,"Those who barter unbelief for faith, will not harm God in the least, and the punishment for them will be painful"
  3,178,"The unbelievers must not think that the respite We give them augurs well. We do so that they sink deeper into sin, and suffer an ignominious doom"
  3,179,"God will not leave the believers in the state they are in till He has sifted the evil from the good; nor will God reveal the secrets of the Unknown. He chooses (for this) from His apostles whom He will. So believe in God and the prophets, for if you believe and fear the displeasure of God your reward will be great"
  3,180,"Let not those who are niggardly of things that God has given them of His largesse think that this is good for them. In fact, it is worse; for what they grudged will be hung around their necks on the Day of Resurrection. To God belong the heavens and the earth, and God is aware of all you do"
