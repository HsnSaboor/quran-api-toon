quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,And Our command is but one (word) swift as the winking of an eye
  54,51,"We have destroyed the likes of you in the past: So is there any one who will be warned"
  54,52,All things they do are (recorded) in the books
  54,53,All things small or great have been written down
  54,54,Surely those who fear God and follow the straight path will be amidst gardens and light
  54,55,At the still centre in the proximity of the King all-powerful
  55,1,AR-RAHMAN
  55,2,Bestowed the Qur'an
  55,3,Created man
  55,4,And taught him to express clearly
  55,5,The sun and moon revolve to a computation
  55,6,And the grasses and the trees bow (to Him) in adoration
  55,7,He raised the sky and set the Balance
  55,8,So that none may err against the scales
  55,9,"And observe correct measure, weigh with justice, and not cheat the balance"
  55,10,He positioned the earth for all the creatures
  55,11,"There are fruits of all kinds on it, and date-palms with their clusters sheathed"
  55,12,"Grain with husk, and fragrant grasses"
  55,13,How many favours of your Lord will then both of you deny
  55,14,He created man of fermented clay dried tinkling hard like earthen ware
  55,15,And created jinns from the white-hot flame of fire
  55,16,How many favours of your Lord will you then deny
