quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  42,52,"So have We revealed to you the Qur'an by Our command. You did not know what the Scripture was before, nor (the laws of) faith. And We made it a light by which We show the way to those of Our creatures as We please; and you certainly guide them to the right path"
  42,53,The path of God to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And will not all things go back to God
  43,1,HA MIM
  43,2,I call to witness the lucent Book
  43,3,That We made it a distinctly lucid Qur'an that you may understand
  43,4,"It is inscribed in the original Book (of Books) with Us, sublime, dispenser of (all) laws"
  43,5,Should We have withdrawn the Reminder from you as you are a people who exceed the bounds
  43,6,Many a prophet had We sent to the earlier communities
  43,7,But never did a prophet come at whom they did not scoff
  43,8,So We destroyed far more powerful (nations) than they. The example of earlier people is there
  43,9,"If you ask them: \"Who created the heavens and the earth?\" they will answer: \"The Mighty and All-knowing created them"
  43,10,"He who made the earth a bed for you, and laid out tracks upon it so that you may find the way"
