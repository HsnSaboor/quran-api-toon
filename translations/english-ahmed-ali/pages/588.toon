quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,Indeed the ledger of the wicked will be in (the lowest depths) Sijjin
  83,8,How will you comprehend what Sijjin is
  83,9,It is a (repository of) distinctly written record
  83,10,Ah the woe that day for those who deny
  83,11,Who call the Day of judgement a lie
  83,12,None denies it but the sinful transgressors
  83,13,"When Our revelations are recited before him, he says: \"These are fables of long ago"
  83,14,No. In fact what they have been doing has rusted their hearts
  83,15,Therefore they will be screened off from their Lord that day
  83,16,Then they will indeed burn in Hell
  83,17,"They will then be told: \"This is what you had denied"
  83,18,Surely the ledger of the pious will be in 'Illiyun (heights above the heights)
  83,19,But how will you comprehend what 'Illiyun is
  83,20,It is a (repository of) distinctly written record
  83,21,Witnessed by those who are honoured
  83,22,Verily the pious will be in heaven
  83,23,On couches face to face
  83,24,On their faces you will see the glow of beatitude
  83,25,"They will be served the choicest wine, sealed"
  83,26,"With a sealing of musk, which those who aspire for the best should desire"
  83,27,"Blended with the water of Tasnim, (heights ultimate of evolution)"
  83,28,A fountain from which only they who are honoured drink
  83,29,The sinners indeed laughed at believers
  83,30,And winked at one another as they passed by them
  83,31,And when they went back to their people turned to make fun of them
  83,32,"And when they saw them, they said: \"They have indeed gone astray"
  83,33,But they were not Sent to be guardians over them
  83,34,"So, the believers will laugh at the infidels on that day"
