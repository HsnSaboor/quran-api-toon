quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,I CALL TO witness the Fig and the Olive
  95,2,The Mount Sinai
  95,3,And this Soil Secure
  95,4,That We created man of finest possibilities
  95,5,Then brought him down to the lowest of the low
  95,6,"Except those who believe and do the right, for whom there is reward undiminished"
  95,7,Who should then make you deny the Judgement after this
  95,8,Is not God the most equitable of all judges
  96,1,READ IN THE name of your Lord who created
  96,2,Created man from an embryo
  96,3,"Read, for your Lord is most beneficent"
  96,4,Who taught by the pen
  96,5,Taught man what he did not know
  96,6,"And yet, but yet man is rebellious"
  96,7,For he thinks he is sufficient in himself
  96,8,Surely your returning is to your Lord
  96,9,Have you seen him who restrains
  96,10,A votary when he turns to his devotions
  96,11,"Have you thought, if he had been on guidance"
  96,12,"Or had enjoined piety, (it would have been better)"
  96,13,Have you thought that if he denies and turns away
  96,14,Does he not know that God sees
  96,15,And yet indeed if he does not desist We shall drag him by the forelock
  96,16,"By the lying, the sinful forelock"
  96,17,So let him call his associates
  96,18,We shall call the guards of Hell
  96,19,"Beware! Do not obey him, but bow in adoration and draw near (to your Lord)"
