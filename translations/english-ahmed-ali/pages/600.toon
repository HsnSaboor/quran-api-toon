quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,And the secrets of the hearts exposed
  100,11,Surely their Lord will be aware of their (deeds)
  101,1,THE STARTLING CALAMITY
  101,2,What is the startling calamity
  101,3,How will you comprehend what the startling calamity is
  101,4,A Day on which human beings would be like so many scattered moths
  101,5,The mountains like the tufts of carded wool
  101,6,Then he whose deeds shall weigh heavier in the scale
  101,7,Will have a tranquil life
  101,8,But he whose deeds are lighter in the balance
  101,9,Will have the Abyss for abode
  101,10,How will you comprehend what that is
  101,11,It is the scorching fire
  102,1,THE AVARICE OF plenitude keeps you occupied
  102,2,Till you reach the grave
  102,3,But you will come to know soon
  102,4,Indeed you will come to know soon
  102,5,And yet if you knew with positive knowledge
  102,6,You have indeed to behold Hell
  102,7,Then you will see it with the eye of certainty
  102,8,Then on that day you will surely be asked about the verity of pleasures
