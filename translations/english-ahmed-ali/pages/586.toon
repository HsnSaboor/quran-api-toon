quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,WHEN THE SUN is folded up
  81,2,The stars turn dim and scatter
  81,3,The mountains made to move
  81,4,The ten-month pregnant female camels are abandoned
  81,5,The wild beasts stampede on the run
  81,6,When the oceans surge and swell
  81,7,When souls are reunited (with the bodies)
  81,8,And the little girl buried alive is asked
  81,9,For what crime she was put to death
  81,10,When the ledgers are laid open
  81,11,The curtain drawn back from the skies
  81,12,When Hell is set ablaze
  81,13,And Paradise brought near
  81,14,(Then) every soul will know what it had prepared (for itself)
  81,15,"So, I call the receding stars to witness"
  81,16,The planets withdrawing into themselves
  81,17,The closing night
  81,18,The rising dawn
  81,19,That this is indeed the word of an honoured Messenger
  81,20,"Full of power, well-established (in position) with the Lord and Master of the Throne"
  81,21,Obeyed and worthy there of trust
  81,22,Your companion is not mad
  81,23,He had surely seen Him on the clear horizon
  81,24,He is not chary of making public what is unknown
  81,25,This is not the utterance of an accursed devil
  81,26,So whither do you stray
  81,27,This is a reminder for all the peoples of the world
  81,28,For those of you who desire to walk the path that is straight
  81,29,"Though you cannot desire except as God will, the Lord of all the worlds"
