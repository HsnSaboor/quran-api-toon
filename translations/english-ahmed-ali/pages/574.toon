quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  73,1,O YOU ENWRAPPED in the cloak (of Prophethood)
  73,2,Keep watch all the night except some
  73,3,A half of it or a little less
  73,4,"Or a little more, and recite the Qur'an slowly and distinctly"
  73,5,We shall soon entrust to you a message heavy (with solemnity)
  73,6,Surely in the watches of the night the soul is most receptive and words more telling
  73,7,Indeed during the day you have a long schedule of occupations
  73,8,"But recite the name of your Lord withdrawing yourself from everything, devoting yourself exclusively to Him"
  73,9,He is the Lord of the East and the West. There is no god but He. So take Him alone as your protector
  73,10,"Bear with patience what they say, and gracefully come away from them"
  73,11,"Leave those to Me who deny, the lovers of ease and comfort; and bear with them for a while"
  73,12,"Verily We shall have fetters with Us, and a roaring furnace"
  73,13,"And food that will stick in the throat, and painful torment"
  73,14,"On the day the earth and mountains will rock violently, and the mountains turn to a heap of poured-out sand"
  73,15,"We have sent an Apostle to you as a witness against you, as We had sent an apostle to the Pharaoh"
  73,16,But the Pharaoh disobeyed the apostle; so We seized him with a grievous punishment
  73,17,"How then, if you disbelieve, will you preserve yourselves on the day which will even turn the children hoary"
  73,18,The heavens itself will be rent asunder (on that day). His promise is bound to be fulfilled
  73,19,Verily this is a reminder. So let him who desires take the way to his Lord
