quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  68,16,We shall brand him on the muzzle
  68,17,We have tried you as We tried the owners of the garden when they vowed to gather the fruits in the morning
  68,18,"But did not add: \"If God may please"
  68,19,"Then a calamity from your Lord fell upon it, but they remained fast asleep"
  68,20,So by the morning it seemed as though picked clean
  68,21,At daybreak they called to each other
  68,22,"If you want to gather the fruits, let us go early to the plantation"
  68,23,"So they departed, talking in low voices"
  68,24,Let no needy person come to you within it today
  68,25,They left early in the morning bent on this purpose
  68,26,"When they saw (and did not recognise it) they said: \"Surely we have lost the way"
  68,27,No. In fact we have been deprived of it
  68,28,"One who was temperate among them, said: \"Did I not say: 'Why don't you priase God"
  68,29,"Glory to our Lord,\" they said; we were really in the wrong"
  68,30,Then they started blaming one another
  68,31,"Saying: \"Alas the woe, we were iniquitous"
  68,32,Maybe our Lord will give us better than this. We turn to our Lord in supplication
  68,33,"Such is Our chastisement; and the punishment of the Hereafter will be greater, if only they knew"
  68,34,For those who fear God there are pleasure gardens with their Lord
  68,35,Should We treat those who submit and obey in the same way as those who are culpable
  68,36,What has come upon you that you judge in such a wise
  68,37,Or have you a Book in which you read
  68,38,That you can surely have whatever you choose
  68,39,"Or have you taken a binding promise from Us which would hold till the Day of Judgement, that you will get whatever you demand"
  68,40,"Ask them: \"Which of you is able to vouch for this"
  68,41,"Or have they any partners? Let them bring their partners then, if what they say is true"
  68,42,"On the day the great calamity befalls, and they are called to bow in homage, they will not be able to do so"
