quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,And uphold my name with posterity
  26,85,And put me among the inheritors of Paradise
  26,86,"Forgive me and my father: He was surely among those who went astray"
  26,87,And do not disgrace me on the day when they are raised from the graves
  26,88,The day when neither wealth nor children will be of any avail
  26,89,But to him who comes to God with a tranquil heart
  26,90,Paradise will be brought near those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path
  26,91,And Hell made visible to those who had gone astray
  26,92,"They will be asked: \"Where are those you worshipped"
  26,93,Other than God? Can they save you or even save themselves
  26,94,They will then be thrown into Hell with those who had gone astray
  26,95,Together with the hordes of Iblis
  26,96,Disputing among themselves they will say
  26,97,"By God, we were plainly in error"
  26,98,In equating you with the Lord of all the worlds
  26,99,No one but the sinners led us astray
  26,100,Now we have none to intercede for us
  26,101,Nor any sincere friend
  26,102,If only we could return and be among the believers
  26,103,"Verily there is a sign in this, but many of them do not believe"
  26,104,Verily your Lord is mighty and merciful

  26,106,"When their brother Noah said to them: \"Will you not take heed"
  26,107,I have been sent as a trusted messenger to you
  26,108,So be fearful of God and listen to me
  26,109,I ask no recompense of you for it. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds
  26,110,So fear God and follow me
  26,111,"They said: \"Should we place our trust in you when only the condemned follow you"
