quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  5,96,"Lawful is all game of the water for you, and eating of it as food, so that you and the travellers may benefit by it. But unlawful is game of the jungle when you are on pilgrimage. Fear God before whom you have to gather in the end"
  5,97,"God has made the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, a means of support for mankind, as also the holy month, the sacrificial offerings, and consecrated cattle, so that you may understand that known to God is all that is in the heavens and the earth, and God has knowledge of everything"
  5,98,"Know that the punishment of God is severe, but that God is also forgiving and kind"
  5,99,"It is for the Prophet to convey the message: God knows what you reveal and what you hide"
  5,100,"Tell them: \"The unclean and the pure are not equal, even though the abundance of the unclean may be pleasing to you.\" So fear God, O men of wisdom; you may haply find success"
  5,101,"O believers, do not ask about things which, if made known to you, may vex you. But if you ask about them when the Qur'an is being revealed they will be unfolded to you. God has overlooked (your failings) in this (respect), for God is forgiving and forbearing"
  5,102,"Such things were asked by a people before you, but they disbelieved them afterwards"
  5,103,"God has not sanctioned Baheerah or Sa'ibah, Waseelah or Ham. The unbelievers fabricate lies of God, for many of them are devoid of sense"
