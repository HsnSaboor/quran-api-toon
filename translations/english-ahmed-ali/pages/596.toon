quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,No one will burn in it but the most wretched
  92,16,Who denied (the truth) and turned away
  92,17,But save him who fears
  92,18,And gives of his wealth that he may grow in virtue
  92,19,And is under no one's obligation to return his favour
  92,20,"Other than seeking the glory of his Lord, most high"
  92,21,Will surely be gratified
  93,1,I CALL TO witness the early hours of morning
  93,2,And the night when dark and still
  93,3,"Your Lord has neither left you, nor despises you"
  93,4,What is to come is better for you than what has gone before
  93,5,"For your Lord will certainly give you, and you will be content"
  93,6,Did He not find you an orphan and take care of you
  93,7,"Did He not find you perplexed, and show you the way"
  93,8,Did He not find you poor and enrich you
  93,9,So do not oppress the orphan
  93,10,And do not drive the beggar away
  93,11,And keep recounting the favours of your Lord
  94,1,HAVE WE NOT opened up your breast
  94,2,And removed your burden
  94,3,Which had left you devoid of hope
  94,4,And exalted your fame
  94,5,Surely with hardship there is ease
  94,6,With hardship indeed there is ease
  94,7,So when you are free work diligently
  94,8,And turn to your Lord with all your love
