quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,So he has no friend here this Day
  69,36,nor any food except scum
  69,37,that only sinners eat
  69,38,So I swear by what you see
  69,39,and what you do not see
  69,40,that this is the word of a noble Messenger
  69,41,And It is not the word of a poet; how little you believe
  69,42,nor the word of a soothsayer; how little you remember
  69,43,"The gradual revelations of the Book, is from the Lord of the worlds"
  69,44,"Had he [the Messenger] falsely attributed some statements to Us"
  69,45,We would have seized him by the right arm
  69,46,Then We would have slashed his lifeline
  69,47,and none of you could have protected him
  69,48,"It [The Qur'an] is a reminder for the those who are mindful of God"
  69,49,And We know that some of you will deny it
  69,50,It is a cause of great distress to the unbelievers
  69,51,And it is the Truth of certainty
  69,52,"Exalt, then, the limitless glory of your Lord's magnificent name"
  70,1,An inquirer asked about an impending punishment
  70,2,to the unbelievers that cannot be prevented
  70,3,"from God, the Lord of the Gates of Ascent"
  70,4,Unto Him the angels and the Spirit will ascend in a Day whose length is fifty thousand years
  70,5,So be patient with gracious patience
  70,6,"They [the unbelievers] see it as something distant"
  70,7,but We see it near
  70,8,On the Day the sky will be like molten brass
  70,9,and the mountains will be like tufted wool
  70,10,No good friend will ask about his friend
