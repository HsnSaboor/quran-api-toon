quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  57,19,Those who believed in God and His Messengers are the truthful ones who will bear witness before their Lord. They will have their reward and their light. But the unbelievers and those who reject Our revelations will be the inhabitants of Hell
  57,20,"Know that the life of this world is just a game; recreation, glitter, boasting to one another and rivalry in wealth and children. It is like a rain that helps plants grow, pleasing the growers, but then it dries up and you see it turn yellow, then it becomes stubble. There is severe punishment in the Hereafter, as well as forgiveness from God and [His] approval. The life of this world is only an illusion"
  57,21,"So pursue forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden as vast as the heavens and the earth is prepared for [or 'awaits'] those who believed in God and His Messengers. That is the blessing of God which He gives to whom He wills. God is limitless in His blessings"
  57,22,"No misfortune occurs, either on earth or in your souls but it is recorded in a Book even before We make it happen. That is easy for God"
  57,23,So you will not grieve for what you missed or rejoice over what He has given you. For God does not like the vain and the arrogant
  57,24,"those who are stingy and direct others to be stingy. Whoever turns away, [remember] God is rich beyond need, worthy of all praise"
