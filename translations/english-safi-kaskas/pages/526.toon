quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the falling star
  53,2,"your friend has not strayed, nor has he erred"
  53,3,Nor does he speak from his own whims
  53,4,It is a revealed revelation
  53,5,taught to him by one with mighty powers
  53,6,and splendor who stood still
  53,7,while he was at the highest horizon
  53,8,Then he drew near coming down
  53,9,to within two bows' length or closer
  53,10,"Then God [through that angel] revealed to His servant what He revealed"
  53,11,The heart did not doubt what it saw
  53,12,Do you dispute with him what he saw
  53,13,"Indeed, he saw him in another descent"
  53,14,at the Sidra beyond which none may pass
  53,15,near the Garden of Refuge
  53,16,"where that Sidra was shrouded [in mystery] with what shrouded it"
  53,17,"The eye did not waver, nor did it exceed its limit"
  53,18,He saw some of the greatest signs of his Lord
  53,19,So have you considered al-Lat and al-'Uzza
  53,20,"and Manat, the third, the other one"
  53,21,Why do you chose for yourself male offspring and assign to God the female
  53,22,"That, then, is an unfair distribution"
  53,23,"These [allegedly divine beings] are nothing but names, which you [who worship them] and your forefathers have invented. God sent no authority for them. They [who worship them] follow nothing but guesswork and their egotistical whims, although guidance has come to them [your people] from their Lord"
  53,24,Should man have whatever he wishes for
  53,25,when this life and the life to come belong only to God
  53,26,"There are many angels in the heavens whose intercession is of no benefit at all until God gives permission to whomever He wills, and approves"
