quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun folds
  81,2,and the stars are dispersed
  81,3,when the mountains are shifting
  81,4,and when full-term she-camels are neglected
  81,5,When the wild beasts are gathered
  81,6,when the seas are set aflame
  81,7,when the souls are paired
  81,8,when the female baby who was buried alive is asked
  81,9,for what sin she was killed
  81,10,When the records are made public
  81,11,when the sky is stripped away
  81,12,when Hell is set ablaze
  81,13,when Paradise is brought into view
  81,14,every soul will then know what it has brought with it
  81,15,I swear by the planets
  81,16,the runners and sweepers
  81,17,and by the night as it recedes
  81,18,and the dawn when it breathes
  81,19,this revelation is indeed the word of a honorable Messenger
  81,20,"endowed with strength, secure with the Lord of the Throne"
  81,21,obeyed and trustworthy
  81,22,This fellow of yours is not mad
  81,23,"he has already seen him [Gabriel] in the clear horizon"
  81,24,He does not withhold what is revealed to him from beyond
  81,25,"And it (the Qur'an) is not the word of a devil, expelled from Heaven"
  81,26,"So where, then, will you go"
  81,27,It is only a reminder to all humankind
  81,28,for whoever wills among you to go straight
  81,29,"But you cannot will, unless God, the Lord of the worlds, so wills"
