  37,128,except for God's devout worshipers
  37,129,And We left the later generations saying of him
  37,130,Peace be upon the House of Elijah
  37,131,This how we reward those who do good
  37,132,for he was among Our believing worshipers
  37,133,Lot was indeed one of the messengers
  37,134,We saved him and all of his family
  37,135,except an old woman who stayed behind
  37,136,Then We destroyed the others
  37,137,You pass by them morning
  37,138,"and night, so will you not use your reason"
  37,139,Jonah was one of the messengers
  37,140,He ran away to an loaded ship
  37,141,"but they cast lots, and he lost"
  37,142,"[so they threw him into the sea], and a great fish swallowed him, for He was blameworthy [for what he had done]"
