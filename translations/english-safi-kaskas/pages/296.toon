quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,21,"It is in this way that we caused them to be found, so that people would know that the promise of God is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour [of Resurrection]. As they were arguing among themselves about them, some said, \"Build a structure over them. Their Lord knows best about them.\" But those who prevailed in the matter said: \"We will build a place of worship over them"
  18,22,"Some will say there were three [sleepers], the fourth one being their dog; while others will say there were five, the sixth one being their dog - Just guessing at the unknown. Still others will say there were seven, and the eighth one was their dog. Say, \"My Lord knows their number best. Very few know [the truth] about them, so do not argue about them except in relation to what is clearly known, and do not seek the opinion of any of these people about them"
  18,23,"Never say of anything, \"I will do that tomorrow"
  18,24,"without adding, \"God willing.\" And whenever you forget, remember your Lord and say, \"I pray that my Lord will guide me closer to what is right"
  18,25,And they remained in their cave for three hundred years plus an additional nine
  18,26,"Say, \"God knows best how long they remained. All that is beyond our senses, in the heavens and on the earth belongs to Him. How perfectly He sees, and how perfectly He Hears! They have no protector besides Him, and He does not share His rule with anyone"
  18,27,"Recite what has been revealed to you from your Lord's Book. No one can change His words, and you will never find any refuge except with Him"
