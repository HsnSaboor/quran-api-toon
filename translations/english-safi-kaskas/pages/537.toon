quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,it is a noble Qur'an
  56,78,kept in a well-protected record
  56,79,where none will be allowed to touch it except the purified
  56,80,revealed gradually by the Lord of the worlds
  56,81,Is it then this statement that you are ridiculing
  56,82,and you deny it as if your livelihood depends on it
  56,83,"Why then, when the soul at death reaches the throat"
  56,84,and you are at that time looking on
  56,85,"when we're closer to him than you are, but you do not see"
  56,86,"Why then, if you are not dependent on Us"
  56,87,"don't you restore his soul back to him, if your claim is true"
  56,88,If the deceased was of those brought near to God
  56,89,"he will then have eternal harmony, eternal delight and a Garden of Bliss"
  56,90,And if he was from those on the right
  56,91,"then \"Peace be to you, from your companions on the right"
  56,92,But if he was from those who called the truth a lie and were misguided
  56,93,he will be welcomed with boiling water
  56,94,and will burn in Hell
  56,95,This is the certain Truth
  56,96,"exalt, then, the glory of your Lord's name; the Magnificent"
  57,1,"Everything in the heavens and earth exalts God's limitless glory. He is the Almighty, the Wise"
  57,2,"The Kingdom of the heavens and earth belongs to Him. He gives life and causes death, and He is able to do all things"
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last, the Outer and the Inner, and He has knowledge of all things"
