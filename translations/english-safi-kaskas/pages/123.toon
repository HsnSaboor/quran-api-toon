quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,90,"Believers, intoxicants, gambling, idolatry, and fortunetelling are repugnant and evil acts. They are evil acts of Satan. Avoid them so that you may prosper"
  5,91,"With intoxicants and gambling, Satan only seeks to incite hostility and hatred among you, and to turn you away from remembering God and from prayer. Will you not give them up"
  5,92,"Obey God and obey the Messenger, and always be careful! If you pay no attention, know that Our Messenger's only duty is to clearly transmit the message"
  5,93,"Those who believe and do righteous deeds incur no sin for what they may have participated in, so long as they are mindful of God and believe and do righteous deeds, and continue to be mindful of God and to believe and grow ever more mindful of God and persevere in doing good: God loves those who do good deeds"
  5,94,"Believers, God is sure to tempt you with wild games that come, within reach of your hands and weapons, so He can identify those who fear Him, even though they think He is not watching. Whoever oversteps the limits, will have a painful punishment"
  5,95,"Believers, do not hunt while you are in the state for sanctity. Whoever kills an animal intentionally must make amends by offering an equivalent domestic animal comparable to what was killed as defined by two just men-an offering to be delivered to the Ka'bah. Or, he may atone for his sin by feeding the needy, or by fasting an equivalent number of days, so that he may understand the seriousness of what he has done. God forgives what is past, but if anyone does it again, God will punish him severely. God is mighty, and capable of exacting the penalty"
