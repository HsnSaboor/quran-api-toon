quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,164,"The creation of the heavens and the earth, the difference of night and day, the ships that sail the seas to benefit people, the rain God sends to give life to a lifeless earth and to all kinds of creatures that He scattered over it, the directing of the winds and clouds that run a course between heaven and earth, these are all signs to people who comprehend"
  2,165,"Still, some people equate others to God, and they love them as only God should be loved. Believers, love God more than anything. If the unjust could only see, and they will see when suffering becomes their destiny, that all power is God's and that God is severe in punishment"
  2,166,"When those who were followed disown their followers, and they all see punishment and are at their wit's end"
  2,167,"the followers will say, \"If only we had another chance, we would disown them just as they have disowned us.\" Thus God will make them bitterly regret their works. They will not leave Hell"
  2,168,"People, eat what is permitted and delicious on earth. Do not follow Satan's steps; he is clearly your enemy"
  2,169,"He commands you to do evil and to behave shamelessly, and to say things about God you do not know"
