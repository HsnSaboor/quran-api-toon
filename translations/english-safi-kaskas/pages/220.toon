quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,98,"There had never been a single community that believed and benefited from its faith except Jonah's people. When they believed, We relieved them from the disgrace of suffering in the life of this world and allowed them to enjoy their life for a time"
  10,99,"Had your Lord willed, all the people on earth would have believed, all of them entirely. Is it, then, up to you [Prophet] to compel People to believe"
  10,100,"No soul can ever believe except with God's permission, and He brings disgrace on those who will not use their reason"
  10,101,"Say, \"Look at what there is in the heavens and on earth.\" But signs and warnings will not help the people who will not believe"
  10,102,"What are they waiting for other than the punishment which came to those before them? Say, \"Wait, then, and I will be waiting with you"
  10,103,Then We will save Our Messengers and those who believe. It is incumbent upon us to save the believers
  10,104,"Say, \"People, if you are in doubt as to what my faith is, then [know that] I do not worship those you worship besides God, but I worship God alone, Who will eventually retrieve you back to Him, and I am commanded to be among the believers"
  10,105,"[Prophet,] set your face towards this faith, as a man inclined to the truth. Do not be among those who violate God's unity"
  10,106,"Do not call on any besides God who can neither benefit you nor harm you. If you do it, you will be among the unjust"
