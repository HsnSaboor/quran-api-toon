quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,87,He is God. There is no god but Him. He will gather all of you on the Resurrection Day. There is no doubt about it. Whose word could be truer than God's
  4,88,"How is it that you are double-minded and divided over the hypocrites, seeing that God Himself has disowned them because of their disobedience? Do you, perhaps, want to guide those whom God has let go astray? Whomever God leads astray, you [Messenger] will never find a way for them"
  4,89,"They would love to see you deny the truth just as they have denied it, so you will all be the same. Do not take them as allies until they migrate for God's cause. But if they turn on you with open hostility, then seize them and kill them wherever you may find them. Do not take any of them as your allies or supporters"
  4,90,"Some seek refuge with people with whom you are bound by a treaty, or they come over to you because their consciences forbid them to go to war against you or against their own people. Had God willed, He would have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. So if they withdraw and do not fight you, and offer you peace, God does not allow you to harm them"
  4,91,"You will find others who wish to be safe from you, and from their own people, but whenever they are back in a situation where they are tempted [to fight you], they succumb to it. So if they do not withdraw, offer peace, or restrain themselves from hostility, seize and kill them wherever you encounter them. We give you clear authority against such people"
