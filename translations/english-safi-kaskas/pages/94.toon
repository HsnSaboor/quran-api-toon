  4,95,"Unequal are the passive believers who stay behind, to those who commit themselves, their possessions and their lives to struggling in God's cause.

Even though God has promised the ultimate good unto all believers, those who struggle are favored with a tremendous reward"

  4,97,"While the angels are gathering the souls of those who wronged themselves, they will wonder, \"What was the matter with you?\" They will say, \"We were oppressed in our land.\" [The angels] will ask, \"Was not God's earth vast enough for you to run away?\" These people will have Hell as their refuge, a horrible destination"
  4,98,"The truly helpless, including men, women or children, who do not have the means to leave may be exempt"

  4,100,"He who migrates for God's cause will find many safe places and abundant resources on earth. If anyone leaves his home as an emigrant for God and His Messenger, and then he dies, his reward is certain with God. God is forever forgiving and Merciful-to-all"
  4,101,"When you believers are travelling, you will not be blamed for shortening your prayers if you fear that the unbelievers may harm you. They are your sworn enemies"
