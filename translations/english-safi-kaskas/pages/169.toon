  7,150,"When Moses returned to his people, full of wrath and sorrow, he exclaimed, \"You have followed a foul and evil course in my absence! Have you abandoned your Lord's commandments?\" He threw down the Tablets and seized his brother by the head, dragging him. Aaron cried, \"Son of my mother! These people overpowered me and almost killed me! Do not let my enemies rejoice at my suffering, and do not include me with those unjust people"
  7,151,"[Moses] said, \"Lord, grant my brother and me forgiveness, and cover us with Your mercy. You are the most merciful of those who show mercy"
  7,152,"[To Aaron, he said,] \"As for those who worshiped the calf, they will experience their Lord's anger and be disgraced in this world.\" This is the way we repay all who instigate trouble"
  7,153,"As for those who do bad deeds and afterwards repent and [truly] believe, your Lord is Forgiving and Merciful"
  7,154,"When Moses' anger subsided, he picked up the Tablets, on which were guidance and mercy for those who stood in awe of their Lord"
  7,155,"Moses chose seventy men for our appointment. When they were seized with trembling, he prayed, \"Lord, had You willed, You would have destroyed them, and me as well. Will You destroy us for what the fools among us did? This is a trial from you, whereby You allow whomever You will to go astray and guide whomever You will. You are near to us. Grant us forgiveness, and have mercy on us for You are the most forgiving of all"
