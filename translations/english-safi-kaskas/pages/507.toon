quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"Those who reject the truth and turn others away from the path of God, He will let their deeds go to waste"
  47,2,"While those who believe, and do good deeds and believe in what has been sent down to Muhammad as the Truth from their Lord, He will remove their bad deeds and relieve their concerns"
  47,3,"That is because those who deny the truth follow falsehood, while those who believe follow the Truth from their Lord. In this way God shows to mankind their examples"
  47,4,"So, when you encounter the unbelievers [in battle], strike at their necks. Then, once they are defeated, bind them firmly. Then either release them by grace, or by ransom, until the war is over. God could have defeated them Himself if He had willed, but He wants to test some of you by means of others. As for those who are killed in the cause of God, He will not let their deeds go to waste"
  47,5,He will guide them and will put their mind at ease
  47,6,"And He will admit them to Paradise, which He has already made known to them"
  47,7,"Believers, if you help God, He will help you and make you stand firm"
  47,8,"As for the unbelievers, how miserable will they be? God brought their deeds to nothing"
  47,9,"They hated what God revealed, so He rendered their deeds worthless"
  47,10,"Have they not journeyed through the land and seen the fate of those before them? God destroyed them, and a similar fate awaits all those who persist on denying the truth"
  47,11,That is because God is the protector of those who believe while those who deny the truth have no protector
