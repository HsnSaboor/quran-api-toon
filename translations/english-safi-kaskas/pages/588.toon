quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,"Indeed, the record of the wicked is in Sijjeen"
  83,8,And how would you know what Sijjeen is
  83,9,It is a locked-in digital data record
  83,10,How terrible it is that Day for the deniers
  83,11,who deny the Day of Judgment
  83,12,when only sinful aggressors deny it
  83,13,"When Our verses are recited to him, he says, \"Legends of ancient people"
  83,14,"Not at all! Rather, their hearts have become encrusted by what they were earning"
  83,15,"They will be separated from their Lord, that Day"
  83,16,"Then, they will be rekindling Hell"
  83,17,"They will be then told, \"This is what you used to deny"
  83,18,No indeed! The righteous' record is in 'Illiyyun
  83,19,And how would you know what is Illiyyun
  83,20,It is a digital data record
  83,21,"open to be witnessed by those brought near [to God]"
  83,22,"Indeed, the righteous will be in perfect bliss"
  83,23,"seated on couches, looking around"
  83,24,You will recognize the radiance of bliss on their faces
  83,25,They will be given pure virgin nectar to drink
  83,26,"leaving a great taste in the mouth. Let people with aspirations, aspire to that"
  83,27,It is mixed with the water from Tasneem
  83,28,"a spring from which those near [to God] drink"
  83,29,Those who rejected the faith and severed their relation with God used to laugh at those who believed
  83,30,They would wink at one another when the believers passed by them
  83,31,joking about them when they returned to their people
  83,32,"And if they saw them, they would say, \"Indeed, those are truly lost"
  83,33,"Yet, they were not sent as guardians over them"
  83,34,So today those who believed will laugh at the unbelievers
