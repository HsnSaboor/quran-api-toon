quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,25,"Give good news to the believers who do virtuous deeds; they will have Heavenly Gardens with flowing rivers. Every time they are provided fruit from it, they will say, \"This is similar to what we were provided before.\" It appears to them that they are given the same thing. There they will have pure spouses, [and there] they will be eternally"
  2,26,"God is not reluctant to present a proverb about a mosquito or something bigger. Believers know that it is truth from their Lord, but the unbelievers say, \"What does God mean by this?\" It is a proverb that misguides many and guides many. It misguides only the defiantly disobedient"
  2,27,"Those who break God's covenant after it is confirmed and sever what God commanded to be joined and corrupt the earth, they are doomed"
  2,28,"How can you deny the truth in God when you were dead, and He made you alive? Then He will make you die, then make you alive, and then you will return to Him"
  2,29,"It is He who created everything on the earth for you, and then turned toward heaven, and He made them seven heavens. He has knowledge of all things"
