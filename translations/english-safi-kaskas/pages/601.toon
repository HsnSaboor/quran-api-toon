quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,I swear by the Late Afternoon
  103,2,"the human being is surely, in a state of loss"
  103,3,Except for those who have believed and done good deeds and urged one another to the Truth and urged one another to patience
  104,1,Woe to every scorning backbiter
  104,2,who has amassed wealth and diversified it
  104,3,thinking that his wealth will make him immortal
  104,4,No! He will surely be thrown into the Crusher
  104,5,And what will convey to you what is the Crusher
  104,6,It is the kindled Fire of God
  104,7,reaching right into the hearts
  104,8,it will engulf them
  104,9,in extended columns
  105,1,Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the army who had Elephants
  105,2,Did He not utterly bring their perfect planning to nothing
  105,3,And He sent birds in flocks against them
  105,4,striking them with stones of hard clay
  105,5,He made them like eaten straw
