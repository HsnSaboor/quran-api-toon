quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"Nothing good comes from their secretive discussion, except for when they are encouraging charity, or good or reconciliation between people. To anyone who does this out of a longing for God's pleasure, We will give a great reward"
  4,115,"Whoever deviates, after guidance has been clearly given to him, contentiously opposes the Messenger and follows a path other than that of the believers, We will leave him on his chosen path and let him burn in Hell, an evil destination"
  4,116,"God does not forgive the association of partners with Him, although He forgives any lesser sin of whomever He wills. Those people who worship deities besides Him have gone far, far astray"
  4,117,"In His place the idolaters invoke only idols with female names, thus invoking the rebellious Satan"
  4,118,"whom God has rejected for having said, \"I will certainly claim my due share of your servants"
  4,119,"and will lead them astray and fill them with vain desires. I will command them, and they will slit the ears of cattle. I will command them to corrupt God's creation.\" Whoever chooses Satan as their master, as opposed to God, is utterly ruined"
  4,120,"He makes them promises and fills them with vain desires; yet, whatever Satan promises them is nothing but an illusion"
  4,121,"Such people will have Hell as their home, and they will have no way out"
