  37,25,Why do you not help each other now
  37,26,"No, today they come in absolute submission"
  37,27,"and they will turn on one another, questioning each other"
  37,28,"[Some] will say, \"You used to approach us from a position of power"
  37,29,"The others will say, \"No, you [yourselves] were not believers"
  37,30,"and we had no authority over you, but you were exceedingly arrogant people"
  37,31,"Our Lord's Word has been carried out against us, and we will all taste punishment"
  37,32,"We misled you, and we were ourselves misled"
  37,33,"On that Day, they will share in the punishment"
  37,34,for that is how We deal with those who forced others to reject Our messages
  37,35,"Whenever they were told, \"There is no god but God,\" they became arrogant"
  37,36,"and would say, \"Are we to give up our gods for a mad poet"

  37,45,A cup from a flowing spring will be passed among them
  37,46,white and delicious to the drinkers
  37,47,which will neither sicken nor intoxicate them
  37,48,With them are mates of modest gaze with beautiful eyes
  37,49,just like closely guarded pearls
  37,50,"They will turn to one another, inquiring"
  37,51,"One of them says\" I used to have a friend [on earth]"
