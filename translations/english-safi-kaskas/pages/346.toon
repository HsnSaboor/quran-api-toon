quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,60,and who give whatever they can while their hearts tremble at the thought that they will be returning to their Lord
  23,61,"these are the ones who vie to do good deeds, and they will be the first to attain them"
  23,62,We do not burden any soul with more than it can bear. There is a record with Us which speaks the Truth and they will not be treated unjustly
  23,63,"However, the [unbelievers'] hearts are in confusion about this [message], and they do even do worse deeds"
  23,64,"until We bring those corrupted with opulence for punishment. Only then will they suddenly start crying [to God] for help"
  23,65,Do not cry out today. You will not get any help from Us
  23,66,"For [every time] My verses were recited to you, you turned away from them"
  23,67,"in arrogance, amusing yourself by talking nonsense about them far into the night"
  23,68,"Have they not thought about what We tell them, or has something come to them that did not come to their forefathers"
  23,69,Or do they not recognize their messenger? Is that why they do not acknowledge him
  23,70,"Or do they say, \"He is crazy?\" when in fact he brought them the Truth. But most of them hate the Truth"
  23,71,"If the Truth conformed to their desires, truly, the heavens, and the earth, and whoever is in them would have been corrupted. Instead, We have given them their Reminder, but they turn away from it"
  23,72,"Or [do they think that] you are asking them for compensation, when your Lord's compensation is best? He is the Best of Providers"
  23,73,You call them to a straight path
  23,74,but those who do not believe in the Hereafter deviate from that path
