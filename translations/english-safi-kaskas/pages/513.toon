quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  48,16,"Say to those Dessert-Arabs who stayed behind, \"Eventually, you will be called to face people of great military might; you will either have to fight them, or they will submit to God's will. If you obey, God will give you a good reward; but if you turn away as you turned away before, He will punish you with a painful punishment"
  48,17,"There is no blame on the blind, the lame or the ill. God will admit anyone who obeys Him and His Messenger to Gardens with rivers flowing through them; But He will painfully punish anyone who turns away"
  48,18,"God was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquility to them, and rewarded them with an imminent victory"
  48,19,and abundant gains to capture. God is the Almighty and All-Wise
  48,20,"God has promised you abundant future gains. He has expedited this for you [victory], and has held hostile people's hands back from you; that it may be a sign for the believers, and that He may guide you to a straight path"
  48,21,And there are yet other gains to come. God has already covered for you. God is Able to do all things
  48,22,"If the unbelievers had fought you, they would have turned back and fled. Then they will find neither a protector nor a helper"
  48,23,Such is God's way which is ongoing. You will never find any change in God's way
