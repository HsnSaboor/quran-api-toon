quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,30,"On that day, every soul will find the good that it has done present before it. But it will wish that there were a great distance between it and the evil it has done. God cautions you about Himself. God is compassionate with His worshipers"
  3,31,"Say, \"If you love God, follow me, God will surely love you and forgive your sins. God is forgiving and merciful"
  3,32,"Say, \"Obey God and the Messenger. But if they turn away, God does not love those who deny the truth"
  3,33,"God chose Adam, Noah, Abraham's family, and Imran's family over all people"
  3,34,"a common line of descent, one following the other. God hears all and knows all"
  3,35,"Imran's wife said, \"Lord, I have vowed to you what is in my womb to be wholly dedicated to you; accept it from me. You hear all and know all"
  3,36,"When she gave birth, she said, \"Lord, I have delivered a female.\" God knows well what she delivered--that a male is not like a female. \"I have named her Mary. I seek your protection for her and her children, from the accursed Satan"
  3,37,"Her Lord accepted the female baby favorably and caused her to have a good upbringing and placed her in Zechariah's care. As often as Zechariah visited her in the inner sanctuary, he found she had food. He said, \"Mary, how did you get this?\" She said, \"It is from God. God provides bountifully for whomever he wills"
