quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  65,1,"Prophet, when any of you intend to divorce wives, do so at the beginning of their prescribed waiting period. Calculate the period's term carefully and be mindful of God, your Lord. Do not drive them out of their homes, nor should they leave during that period, unless they have committed a proven adultery. These are the limits of God and whoever oversteps God's limits wrongs his own soul. You never know what new situation God may bring about"
  65,2,"When they have fulfilled their term, either retain them honorably, or part with them honorably. And call from among your just witnesses, to give testimony for God's sake. Anyone who believes in God and the Last Day should heed this. God will find a way out for whoever is mindful of Him"
  65,3,and will provide for him from an unexpected source. God will suffice for those who put their trust in Him. God will achieve His purpose. God has set a due measure for everything
  65,4,"If you have any doubts, regarding a wife who has ceased menstruating and for one who have not yet menstruated, the period of waiting shall be three months. And for those who are pregnant, their term shall be until they have delivered. God makes things easy for those who are mindful of Him"
  65,5,This is God's command which He sent down to you. God will forgive the misdeeds and increase the rewards of anyone who is mindful of Him
