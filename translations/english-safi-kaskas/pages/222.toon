quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,6,Every living creature on earth depends on God for sustenance and He knows where it lives and where it dies. It is all in a clear record
  11,7,"He created the heavens and the earth in six days and the throne of His majesty of His Mightiness extended over the water. [He created this] in order to test which of you is best in deeds. And If you [Prophet] say, \"You will be resurrected after death,\" the unbelievers will answer, \"This is clearly nothing but sorcery"
  11,8,"If We defer their suffering for a specified time, they are sure to say, \"What is preventing it [from coming now]?\" On the Day when it befalls them there will be nothing to divert it from them and they will be overwhelmed by the very thing they mocked"
  11,9,"If We let man taste some of Our mercy and then take it away from him, he will abandon all hope, forgetting all gratitude"
  11,10,"If We let him taste ease and plenty after hardship has touched him, he is sure to say, \"Misfortune has gone away from me.\" He becomes overjoyed and boastful"
  11,11,"Except those who are patient in hard times and do righteous deeds: forgiveness of sins awaits them and a great reward"
  11,12,"Perhaps you are thinking about omitting part of what is being revealed to you, and you feel a tightness in your chest about it because they say, \"If only a treasure were sent down to him, or an angel came with him [then we would believe].\" [Prophet,] you are only a warner, it is God who is in charge of everything"
