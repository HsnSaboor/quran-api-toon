quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"Those who believe ask \"why no chapter has been sent down [about fighting].\" Yet when a decisive chapter is sent down, and fighting is mentioned in it, you see those with sickness in their hearts looking at you like someone about to faint from fear of death. It is more appropriate"
  47,21,"To show Obedience and good words. Then, when the decision to fight has been made, being true to God would have been better for them"
  47,22,Would you prefer to turn away and go spreading corruption on earth and sever your ties of kinship
  47,23,"Those are the ones that God has rejected, so He deafened them and blinded their vision"
  47,24,Will they not ponder the Qur'an? Or are there locks upon their hearts
  47,25,"Those who turned back in their tracks after guidance became clear to them, Satan enticed them and has given them false hope"
  47,26,"That is because they said to those who hate what God has sent down, \"We will obey you in certain matters.\" But God knows their secrets"
  47,27,"How will it be when the angels gather them in death, beating their faces and their backs"
  47,28,That is because they pursued what displeases God and hated what pleases Him. So He rendered their deeds worthless
  47,29,Or do those with sickness in their hearts think that God will not expose their malice
