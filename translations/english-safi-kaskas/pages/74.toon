quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,181,"God has heard those who said, \"God is poor, and we are rich.\" We will write down what they said and their wrongful killing of the prophets in defiance of all that is right. We tell them, \"Experience the fire's punishment"
  3,182,"That is for what your hands have committed, because God is never unjust to his servants"
  3,183,"They are those who said that God has made a covenant with us not to believe in a messenger unless he brings us an offering that fire consumes. Say, \"Messengers before me have come to you with miracles including the one you mentioned, so why did you kill them if you are telling the truth"
  3,184,"And if they reject you, so also were messengers rejected who came before you, who brought miracles, written texts and the enlightening Book"
  3,185,"Every soul will experience death, and your true compensation will come on the Resurrection Day. The victor is he who is drawn away from Hell to enter the Heavenly Garden, for the life of this world is merely an illusion"
  3,186,"You will certainly be tested in your wealth and yourselves and will certainly hear hurtful things from those previously given the Book and the idolaters. But if you endure and are mindful of God, this proves the strength of your resolve"
