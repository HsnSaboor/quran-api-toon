quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the daybreak
  89,2,and by ten nights
  89,3,by the even and the odd
  89,4,and by the night as it recedes
  89,5,"is there not in [all] that an oath for a rational person"
  89,6,Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with Aad
  89,7,with Iram of the pillars
  89,8,whose like was never created in any land
  89,9,"with Thamud, those who carved the rocks in the valley"
  89,10,"And with Pharaoh, of the stakes"
  89,11,All of them committed excesses in the lands
  89,12,and spread much corruption there
  89,13,So your Lord poured on them a scourge of punishment
  89,14,Your Lord is always watchful
  89,15,"As for human being, whenever his Lord tests him, by honoring him, and blessing him, he says, \"My Lord has honored me"
  89,16,"But when He tries him, and restricts his provision for him, he says, \"My Lord has humiliated me"
  89,17,Not at all! It is you who are not generous with the orphans
  89,18,and you do not urge one another to feed the needy
  89,19,"you who devour the inheritance [of others] with obvious greed"
  89,20,and you who passionately love wealth
  89,21,"No indeed! When the earth is crushed, pounded and crushed"
  89,22,"and your Lord comes with the angels, row after row"
  89,23,"on that Day, Hell will be brought near. On that Day, the human being will remember, but what good will that be to him then"
