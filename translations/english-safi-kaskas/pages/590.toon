quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  85,1,By the heavens full of great constellations
  85,2,by the promised Day
  85,3,and by the witness and the witnessed
  85,4,how terrible were the people of the trench
  85,5,"[using] fire supplied with fuel"
  85,6,while they sat around it
  85,7,to watch what they were doing to the believers
  85,8,"The only reason they punish them was because they believed in God, the Almighty, the Praiseworthy"
  85,9,"to whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. God, is Witness over all things"
  85,10,"Those who persecute believing men and women, and have not repented afterwards, will have the punishment of Hell, and they will have the punishment of Burning"
  85,11,"Indeed, those who believe and do good deeds will have Gardens with rivers flowing through them. That is the great victory"
  85,12,Your Lord's punishment is truly severe
  85,13,"It is He who begins [Creation] and repeats it"
  85,14,"He alone is Truly-Forgiving, All-Embracing in His love"
  85,15,The Glorious Lord of the Throne
  85,16,Doer of whatever He wills
  85,17,Has the story of the legions reached you
  85,18,"[those of] Pharaoh and Thamud"
  85,19,Yet those who denied the truth are persistent in denial
  85,20,while God will encircle them from behind
  85,21,This is indeed a Glorious Qur'an
  85,22,in a Preserved Tablet
