quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,71,"People of the Book, \"Why do you clothe the Truth with falsehood, and knowingly hide the Truth"
  3,72,"Some People of the Book said, \"Believe in what was revealed to the believers at daybreak, and deny it at sunset, so they may return [to their ignorance]"
  3,73,"Only trust those who follow your faith.\" Say, \"True guidance is God's guidance. But you think it is impossible for anyone to be given the same revelation as you were given, or that they could use it to argue against you before your Lord. \" Say, \"Grace is in God's hand, and He gives it to those He wills. God is infinite, All-knowing"
  3,74,"He singles out for His mercy whomever He wills, and God has boundless grace"
  3,75,"Some of the People of the Book you can trust with a lot of gold, and they will return it to you. If you give others of them merely one coin, they will not return it to you unless you constantly remind them. That is because they say, \"We are under no obligation to the Gentiles.\" They knowingly say lies about God"
  3,76,"Indeed, God loves those who keep His covenant and are always mindful of Him"
  3,77,"Those who barter God's covenant and their oaths for a small price have no portion in the Hereafter, and God will not speak to them or look at them on the Resurrection Day, nor will He cleanse them of their sins. They will a have painful punishment"
