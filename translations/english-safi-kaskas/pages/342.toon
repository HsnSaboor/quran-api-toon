quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,The believers have prospered
  23,2,They are those who humble themselves in prayer
  23,3,who turn away from meaningless talk
  23,4,pay the purifying alms
  23,5,and who protect their chastity
  23,6,"except with their wives or with those whom their right hands held in trust, for which they will not be blamed"
  23,7,Those who desire anything beyond that are transgressors
  23,8,whereas those who honor their trusts and their promises
  23,9,and who keep up their prayers
  23,10,those are the inheritors
  23,11,"who will inherit the Paradise of Ferdous, where they will dwell for eternity"
  23,12,And We did certainly create man from an extract of clay
  23,13,and then We placed him as a fertilized ovum in a safe place
  23,14,"and then We transformed the fertilized ovum into a clinging leach, and the leach into a chewed morsel, and [from] the chewed morsel, We created bones, and We covered the bones with flesh, and then we structured him into yet another creation. Blessed is God, the best of creators"
  23,15,"Then, after that, you will surely die"
  23,16,"Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will be resurrected"
  23,17,"And We have created above you seven heavenly dimensions, and We have never abandoned [Our] creation"
