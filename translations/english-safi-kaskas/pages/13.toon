quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,84,We took your pledge that you don't shed one another's blood or drive one another from your homeland. You acknowledged and witnessed it
  2,85,"[Nevertheless], here you are, you kill one another and expel some of your own people from their homeland. You assist each other against your own in sin and hostility. But when they come to you as captives, you ransom them, though it is forbidden for you to expel them. Do you believe in part of the Book but not in the rest? What is the repayment for those of you who do that but humiliation in this world? And, on the day of resurrection, they will be sent to the severest punishment. God is aware of what you do"
  2,86,"The punishment of those who trade this life for the Hereafter will not be lightened, and they will not be saved"
  2,87,"We gave Moses the Book, and he was followed by other messengers, and [We] gave Jesus, the son of Mary, all evidence of the truth, and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. Whenever a messenger comes to you with a message you do not like, you become arrogant, calling some of them liars, and murdering some of them"
  2,88,"They said, \"Our hearts are hardened.\" God has rejected them in their unbelief. How little they believe"
