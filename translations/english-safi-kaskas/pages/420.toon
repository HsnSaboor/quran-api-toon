quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  33,16,"Say, \"Fleeing will not benefit you. If you should flee from death or killing, you will be permitted to enjoy life for only a short while"
  33,17,"Say, \"Who is it that can prevent God from harming you, if He wishes, or being merciful to you, if He wishes?\" They will find no protector or helper other than God"
  33,18,"God knows those among you who would hold you back, as well as those who would say to their brothers, \"Come to us,\" and hardly go to battle"
  33,19,"They do not care about you, and, when fear [of battle] comes, you see them looking at you with their eyes rolling like one overtaken by death. Yet, as soon as the danger has gone, they lash out at you with sharp tongues, resenting any good that comes to you. Such people have no faith, so God has rendered their deeds worthless, that is easy for God"
  33,20,"They think the war parties have not [yet] withdrawn, and, if the war parties should come [again], they would wish they were in the desert among the Bedouins, seeking news about you [from a safe distance]. Even if they were among you, they would hardly fight at all"
  33,21,"The Messenger of God is an excellent model for anyone who puts his hope in God and the Last Day, and remembers God often"
  33,22,"And when the Believers saw the war parties, they said, \"This is what God and His Messenger had promised us; God and His Messenger spoke the truth.\" This only increased their faith and submission"
