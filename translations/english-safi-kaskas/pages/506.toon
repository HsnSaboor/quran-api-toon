quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  46,29,"We sent a group of jinn to you [Prophet) to listen to the Qur'an. When they heard it, they said \"Listen quietly.\" Then when it was concluded, they went back to their people to warn them"
  46,30,"They said, \"Our people, We have heard a Book revealed after Moses confirming what is available of it, guiding to the Truth and to a straight path"
  46,31,"Our people, respond to the Caller to God. Believe in Him; He will forgive you your sins and will protect you from a painful punishment"
  46,32,"But he who does not respond to God's call can never escape God's reach on earth, and have no protectors besides Him. Those are clearly misguided"
  46,33,"Do they not see that God, who created the heavens and earth and was never tired in doing so. Is He Able to bring the dead back to life? Yes indeed. He is Able to do all things"
  46,34,"On the Day when the unbelievers are exposed to the Fire \"Is this not the truth?\" They will say, \"Yes, by our Lord.\" He will say, \"Then taste the punishment for having rejected the Truth"
  46,35,"Be patient, as were those messengers of firm resolve. And do not seek to hasten punishment for them. On the Day when they see what they are promised, it will seem as they had only stayed for an hour of a single day [on earth]. An announcement: will any be destroyed except the defiantly rebellious people"
