  3,16,"who say, \"Our Lord, We have believed, so forgive us our sins and protect us from the punishment of Hell"
  3,17,"They are the ones who are patient in hard times, true to their word, devout, generous and who pray before dawn for forgiveness"
  3,18,"God bears witness that there is no God but Him, as do the angels, and those who are endowed with knowledge. He is the Upholder of Justice. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Wise"
  3,19,"To God true faith is submission [Islam], and those who received the Book differed only after receiving knowledge out of contention. God will be swift in reckoning with those who deny His revelations"
  3,20,"If they dispute with you, say, \"My followers and I have totally submitted to God.\" Say to those who were given the Book and to the Gentiles, \"Have you submitted?\" If they submit, they have been guided. If they turn away, your responsibility is to only convey the message. God is well aware of His worshipers"
  3,21,"Tell those who deny God's revelations, who wrongfully kill prophets and kill those who call for justice, that they will have painful punishment"
  3,22,"Their works have failed both in this world and in the Hereafter, and they have no one to rescue them"
