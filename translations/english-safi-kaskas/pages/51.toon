quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,10,Neither the possessions nor the children of the unbelievers will help them at all with God. They are fuel for Hell
  3,11,"As in the case of Pharaoh's people and those before them, they have denied our signs, so God punished them for their sins. God is severe in punishment"
  3,12,"Say to the unbelievers, \"You will be defeated and gathered into Hell - a dreadful suffering place"
  3,13,"You already have a sign: Two groups met [in battle], one fighting in God's cause and the other denying Him; with their own eyes the unbelievers saw the believers as double in numbers.\" God provides help to whomever He wills. That is a lesson for those who have eyes to see"
  3,14,"The love of worldly pleasures is alluring to people: women, children, vast hoards of gold and silver, branded horses, cattle, and farmland. These are matters of this world. God has the best of destinations"
  3,15,"Say, \"Will I tell you of better things than that? Those that were mindful of God will have Heavenly Gardens with their Lord, with flowing rivers. They will live there forever, with purified mates and God's grace.\" God is fully aware of His worshipers"
