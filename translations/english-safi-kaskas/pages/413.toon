quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  31,20,"Do you not see that God has made everything in heaven and on earth subject to you, and has abundantly showered you with His favors, [both] seen and unseen? Yet some people argue about God in ignorance without guidance or illuminating Scripture"
  31,21,"And when they are told, \"Follow what God has revealed,\" they say, \" We will follow what we found our fathers doing.\" [What?] Even if Satan was inviting them to the punishment of the Blazing Fire"
  31,22,"Whoever turns his face in submission to God while he is doing good has grasped the most trustworthy handhold. God determines the outcome of [all] matters"
  31,23,"And do not let the denial of those who continue to deny the truth grieve you, [Prophet]. They will return to Us, and We will tell them everything that they have done. God knows everything that lies within the heart"
  31,24,"We will grant them some enjoyment for a while, [but] then We will force a massive punishment on them"
  31,25,"And, if you asked them, \"Who created the heavens and earth?\" They would say, \"God.\" Say, \"[All] praise is [due] to God,\" but most of them do not understand"
  31,26,"Whatever is in the heavens and earth belongs to God, for God is the Rich beyond need, the Praiseworthy"
  31,27,"If all the trees on earth were pens and the sea [were] ink with seven [more] seas to replenish it, God's words would not be exhausted, for God is almighty and wise"
  31,28,"Creating and resurrecting all of you is [for God] like creating and resurrecting a single soul. God is All-Hearing and All-Seeing"
