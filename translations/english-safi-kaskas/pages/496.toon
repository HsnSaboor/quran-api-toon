quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  44,1,Ha Meem
  44,2,by the Book that makes things clear
  44,3,We have revealed it on a Blessed Night; We have been warning
  44,4,On that night every matter of wisdom is made distinct
  44,5,A decree from Us. We have been sending messages
  44,6,"as mercy from your Lord. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing"
  44,7,"The Sustainer of the heavens and the earth and everything between them, if you only can grasp this with certainty"
  44,8,"There is no god but Him; He gives life and causes death. [He is] your Sustainer and the Sustainer of your forefathers from the beginning"
  44,9,Yet they who lack certainty toy with their doubts
  44,10,So watch out for the Day when the sky will bring visible smoke
  44,11,"enveloping all people; \"This is a painful punishment"
  44,12,"[Then they will say], \"Our Lord, lift the punishment from us, we now believe"
  44,13,But how can this sudden remembrance benefit them? When a messenger explaining things clearly has already come to them
  44,14,"and they turned away from him saying, \"He is tutored but possessed"
  44,15,We will postpone the punishment for a while. But you will eventually return to us
  44,16,"The Day when We will strike with the greatest assault, We will take retribution"
  44,17,"We had already tested Pharaoh's people before them, when a noble messenger came to them"
  44,18,"[saying], \"Hand over to me the servants of God. I am a trustworthy Messenger to you"
