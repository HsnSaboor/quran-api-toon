quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  50,1,Qaf and the Glorious Qur'an
  50,2,"They marveled that someone from among their midst has come to them with a warning. The unbelievers say, \"This is an amazing thing"
  50,3,Once We have died and become dust? That is a most unlikely return
  50,4,"We know how many of them the earth consumes, and We keep a comprehensive record [about each one of them]"
  50,5,"But when the Truth came to them, they denied it; they are in a state of confusion"
  50,6,"Have they not looked at the sky above them, how We structured it, and beautified it with all its gateways"
  50,7,"And the earth, how We spread it out and placed on it firm mountains, and made every beautiful pair of plants grow in it"
  50,8,This is an insight and a reminder to every worshiper who willingly turns to God
  50,9,And We sent down blessed rain from the sky and grew gardens and grain to harvest
  50,10,"And soaring palm trees, with clustered dates"
  50,11,"as provision for the worshipers. By it [the rain] We gave life to a dead town. This is how the emergence [from the graves] will take place"
  50,12,"Before them the people of Noah denied the truth, and so did the dwellers of Rass, Thamud"
  50,13,"Aad, Pharaoh and the brothers of Lot"
  50,14,"the woods-dwellers and the people of Tubba'. All of these people rejected their messengers, so My threat was justly fulfilled"
  50,15,Were We exhausted by the first creation? But they are dubious of a new creation
