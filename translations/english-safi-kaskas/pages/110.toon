quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,14,"And We also took the pledge from those who say \"We are Christians,\" but they have forgotten part of what they were told to keep in mind. That caused resentment and hatred among them, which We have permitted until the Resurrection Day, when God will explain to them what they have done"
  5,15,"People of the Book, Our Messenger has come to you to clarify much of what you used to conceal of the Book and to overlook much. An enlightenment has now come to you from God and a clear Book"
  5,16,"Through it God guides those who follow what pleases Him to ways of peace and by His permission, He will bring them out from the darkness of ignorance into enlightenment, and will guide them to a straight path"
  5,17,"Those who say, \"God is the Messiah, the son of Mary,\" are defying the truth. Say, \"If it had been God's will, could anyone have prevented Him from destroying the Messiah, son of Mary, together with his mother and everyone else on earth?\" For God has control over the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He creates whatever He wants and has power over all things"
