quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,40,"And one Day He will gather them all and say to the angels, \"Was it you whom these people worshipped"
  34,41,"They will say, \"May You be exalted in Your glory. You are our protector, not them. Rather, they [the unbelievers] used to worship the jinn; most of them believed in them"
  34,42,"Today, none of you hold any power to benefit or harm another,\" and We will say to those who wronged themselves, \"Taste the punishment of the Fire, which you used to deny"
  34,43,"When our clear verses are recited to them [your people], they say, \"This is only a man who wants to turn you away from what your ancestors worshipped.\" They [also] say, \"This is only a lie that he has invented.\" When the Truth comes to them, the unbelievers say, \"This is nothing but sorcery"
  34,44,"[Even] though We had not given them any Books to study nor sent any one before you, [Prophet], to warn them"
  34,45,"Those before them similarly rejected the truth, when they did not receive a tenth of what We had given them [your people], yet they [the previous people] rejected My Messengers, and how [terrible] was My disapproval"
  34,46,"Say, \"I only have one advice for you: Stand up before God, in pairs or individually, and then reflect. Your companion is not crazy. He is here only to warn you of a severe impending punishment"
  34,47,"Say, \"The payment for which you think I ask you is yours. My payment comes only from God, and He is the Witness over all things"
  34,48,"Say, \"My Lord hurls forth the Truth, for He has the full knowledge of all that is beyond our knowledge"
