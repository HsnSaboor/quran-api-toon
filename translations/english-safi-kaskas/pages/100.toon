quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,135,"Believers, uphold justice and bear witness to God, even if that witness is against yourself, your parents or your close relatives.

  4,139,Are those who ally themselves with the unbelievers rather than the believers doing so because they seek power through them? Power is only God's to give
  4,140,"He has already revealed to you in the Book that whenever you hear people denying and mocking God's message, you should avoid their company until they start talking about other things, or else you will become like them. God will gather the hypocrites in Hell, together with the unbelievers"
