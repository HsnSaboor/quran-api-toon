quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and its morning light
  91,2,and the moon as it follows it
  91,3,and the day when it reveals it
  91,4,and the night when it conceals it
  91,5,and the sky and He who built it
  91,6,and the earth and He who spread it
  91,7,and by the soul and He who proportioned it
  91,8,"and inspired it [with knowledge to distinguish] its wickedness and its righteousness"
  91,9,Successful is he who purifies it
  91,10,and failing is he who corrupts it
  91,11,"In their overwhelming arrogance, the people of Thamud called the Messenger a liar"
  91,12,and allowed their most wicked to lead them
  91,13,"The Messenger of God said to them, \"This is the she-camel of God, so let her drink"
  91,14,"But they called him a liar, and hamstrung her. So their Lord destroyed them for their crime, and leveled it"
  91,15,He doesn't fear the consequence
  92,1,By the night as it conceals
  92,2,and the day when it reveals
  92,3,and He who created the male and the female
  92,4,your striving is indeed diverse
  92,5,As for he who gives and is mindful of God
  92,6,and believes in goodness
  92,7,We will smooth his way toward all that is easy
  92,8,But as for he who is stingy and considers himself self-sufficient
  92,9,and denies goodness
  92,10,We will ease him toward hardship
  92,11,His wealth will not help him the least when he falls
  92,12,"Indeed, it is upon Us to guide you"
  92,13,"And indeed, to Us belong the last life and this first life"
  92,14,"so, I have warned you of a Blazing Fire"
