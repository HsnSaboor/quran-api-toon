quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,22,"And as he made his way toward Midian, he was saying, \"Perhaps my Lord will guide me in the right way"
  28,23,"When he came to the well of Midian, he found there a crowd of people watering [their flocks], and beside them he found two women holding back their flocks. He said, \"What is going on?\" They said, \"We cannot water until the shepherds take their flocks away, and our father is an old man"
  28,24,"So he watered their flocks for them. Then he went back to the shade and said, \"My Lord, I am very much in need for whatever good You might send down to me"
  28,25,"Then, one of the two women came walking toward him shyly and said, \"My father would like to pay you for having watered [our flock] for us.\" So when Moses came to him and told him his story, he said, \"Don't be afraid. You have escaped from those oppressive people"
  28,26,"One of the women said, \"Father, hire him. A strong and the trustworthy man is the best that you can hire"
  28,27,"He said, \"I want to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you, on [condition] that you work for me for eight full years; but if you complete ten, it will be seen [as a favor] from you. I do not wish to make things difficult for you. You will find me to be, God willing, a fair man"
  28,28,"[Moses] said, \"That is a deal between us. Whichever of the two terms I complete, there should be no bad feelings toward me. May God be Witness over what we say"
