  22,31,"inclining [only] to God, not associating [anything] with Him. And he who associates others with God- it is as though he had fallen from the sky and was snatched by the birds or the wind carried him down into a remote place"

  22,34,"We have appointed a rite [of sacrifice] for every nation, so that they may mention the name of God over whatever [sacrificial] animals He has provided them. Your god is one God, so submit to Him. And, give good news to the humble of heart"

  22,36,"We have appointed sacrificial animals for you among the rituals of God.

Thus We have subjected them to you so that hopefully you may be grateful"

  22,38,God will defend the believers. God does not like the treacherous and ungrateful
