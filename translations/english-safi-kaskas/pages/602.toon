quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,So that Quraysh remains secure
  106,2,They are secure in their Winter and Summer journeys
  106,3,Let them worship the Lord of this House
  106,4,"who has fed them after hunger, and made then safe after fear"
  107,1,Have you seen the one who denies this faith
  107,2,For that is the one who drives the orphan away
  107,3,and does not encourage the feeding of the poor
  107,4,So woe to those who pray
  107,5,"but, who do not pay attention to their prayer"
  107,6,"Those who make a show [of their deeds]"
  107,7,and withhold assistance to others
  108,1,We have given you all that is good in abundance
  108,2,so pray to your Lord and sacrifice for Him
  108,3,Your enemy is the one who is cut off
