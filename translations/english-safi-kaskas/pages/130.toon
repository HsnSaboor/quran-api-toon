quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Say, \"What counts most as a witness to the truth?\" Say, \"God is witness between you and me. This Qur'an has been revealed to me to warn you and everyone it reaches.\" Could you in truth bear witness that there are other gods besides God? Say, \"I bear no [such] witness.\" Say, \"He is only One God, and I have nothing to do with whatever you associate with Him"
  6,20,"Those to whom We have previously given the Book before, know this as well as they know their own children; yet those who deceive themselves refuse to believe"
  6,21,Who does greater wrong than someone who fabricates lies against God or denies His revelations? Those who do such wrong will not prosper
  6,22,"One Day We will gather them all together and say to the idolaters, \"Where are those beings you imagined to be partners with God"
  6,23,"In their utter confusion, they will only say, \"By God, our Lord, we did not mean to associate partners with Him"
  6,24,See how they have lied to themselves and how the gods they invented have abandoned them
  6,25,"Among them are some who [appear] to listen to your [message, Prophet], but We have laid covers over their hearts and deafness in their ears which prevent them from grasping the truth. Even if they saw every sign, they would still not believe it. When they come to you, they argue with you. The unbelievers say, \"These are nothing but fairy tales"
  6,26,"They tell others not to listen, while they stay away. They destroy no one but themselves, though they fail to realize this"
  6,27,"If you could only see them when they will have to stand before the fire and say, \"If only we were brought back, we would not reject the revelations of our Lord, but would be among the believers"
