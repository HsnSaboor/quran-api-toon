quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,62,"They swear by God, hoping to please you, but it is proper for them to please God and His Messenger, if they are Believers"
  9,63,"Did they not know that whoever opposes God and His Messenger will go to the fire of Hell [and] remain there forever? This is the greatest disgrace"
  9,64,"The hypocrites fear lest a chapter be revealed that will expose what is in their hearts. Say, \"Mock all you want. God will bring about what you fear"
  9,65,"If you were to question them, they would surely answer, \"We were just joking and having fun.\" Say, \"Is it God, His messages and His Messenger that you were joking about"
  9,66,"Do not offer excuses. You have denied the truth after believing.\" Even though We may forgive some of you, We will punish others because they were guilty"
  9,67,"The hypocrites, both men and women, are all the same: they ordain what is wrong and forbid what is right. They are tight fisted. They have forgotten God, and so He has forgotten them. They are defiantly disobedient"
  9,68,"God has promised both the hypocrites-men and women-[and] the unbelievers the fire of Hell, where they will stay forever. This is sufficient for them. God has rejected them, and ever-lasting suffering awaits them"
