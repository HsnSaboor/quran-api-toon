  11,48,"It was said [by God], \"Noah, descend in peace from Us and with blessings on you as well as on [some of the] nations [that descend] from among those who are with you. [But as for] others [of their descendants], We will allow them to enjoy life [for a little while], and then a painful punishment from Us will afflict them"
  11,49,"These accounts are part of what was beyond your knowledge [Muhammad]. We revealed them to you. Neither you nor your people knew them, so be patient [like Noah] in hard times. The future belongs to those who are mindful of God"
