  40,26,"Pharaoh said, \"Let me kill Moses and let him appeal to his Lord. I fear that he may change your religion or spread disorder in the land"
  40,27,"But Moses said, \"I have sought refuge in my Lord and yours from every arrogant tyrant who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning"
  40,28,"A believing man from Pharaoh's family, who concealed his faith, said, \"Are you going to kill a man [merely] because he says, 'My Lord is God, 'when he has brought you clear signs from your Lord? If he is lying, then the consequence of his lie will be on him, but if he is truthful, then some of what he promises you will happen to you. God does not guide the blatant liars"
  40,29,"My people, you reign today, masters in the land, but who will protect us from God's mighty punishment if it should come to us?\" Pharaoh said, \"I show you only what I see, and I am guiding you along the right path"
  40,30,"But the believer said, \"My people, I fear for you a day as befell the parties [who opposed their messengers]"

  40,32,"My people, I fear for you the Day of Calling"
  40,33,"the Day when you will turn away, hoping to flee, with no one to protect you from God. Whomever God allows to stray has no guide"
