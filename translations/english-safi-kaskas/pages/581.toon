quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Did We not create you from an insignificant liquid
  77,21,Then lodged it in a secure place
  77,22,for a known term
  77,23,"And We determined it, how excellently We determine"
  77,24,How terrible is that Day for the deniers of the truth
  77,25,Have We not made the earth a home
  77,26,for the living and the dead
  77,27,"And We placed firmly embedded mountains in it, rising high, and given you sweet water to drink"
  77,28,How terrible is that Day for the deniers of the truth
  77,29,Proceed to what you used to deny
  77,30,Proceed to a shadow with three columns
  77,31,that has no shade and will not prevent you from the flame
  77,32,"It shoots sparks [as huge] as a fortress"
  77,33,like giant fiery ropes
  77,34,How terrible is that Day for those who deny the truth
  77,35,On that Day they will be speechless
  77,36,and they not be given permission to offer any excuses
  77,37,How terrible is that Day for those who deny the truth
  77,38,This is the Day of Decision; We will have gathered you together with the earlier people
  77,39,"So if you have a ploy, then use it against my plan now"
  77,40,How terrible is that Day for those who deny the truth
  77,41,The God-conscious will be amidst shades and springs
  77,42,and any fruits they desire
  77,43,Eat and drink and enjoy it as a reward for your deeds
  77,44,This is how We reward those who do good
  77,45,How terrible is that Day for those who deny the truth
  77,46,"You are but dissenters. So eat and enjoy yourselves a little [while you can]"
  77,47,How terrible is that Day for the deniers of the truth
  77,48,"And when It is said to them, \"Bow down [in prayer],\" they do not bow"
  77,49,How terrible is that Day for those who denied the truth
  77,50,In what message beyond this will they believe
