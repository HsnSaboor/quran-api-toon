quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,174,"So they returned with grace and favor from God; no harm had touched them. And they worked hard at pleasing God, for truly God's favor is great"
  3,175,"It is Satan who is trying to get you to fear his allies, so do not be afraid, but fear Me, if you are believers"
  3,176,Do not let those who rush to unbelief grieve you. They will not harm God at all. It is God's will that they will have no part in the life to come. They will have great punishment
  3,177,Those who chose to deny God over faith will not harm God at all. They will have painful punishment
  3,178,"Those who are adamantly denying God shouldn't think that granting them more time, is necessarily better for them. We give them more time, but they only increase their guilt. They will have shameful punishment"
  3,179,"God would not leave the believers in the state they are in, until He identifies the wicked from the sincere. Nor would God reveal to you His unseen plan, but God chooses messengers according to His will. So believe in God and his Messengers. If you believe and are mindful of God, you will have a great reward"
  3,180,"Those who are tightfisted with what God has given them out of His abundance must not think that it is good for them; in fact, it is terrible for them. Whatever they cruelly withhold will be hung around their necks on Resurrection Day. It is God who will inherit the heavens and the earth: God is well aware of all you do"
