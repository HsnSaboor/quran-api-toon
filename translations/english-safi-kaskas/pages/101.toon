quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"They wait to see what happens to you and, if God brings you success. They say, \"Were we not on your side?\" If the unbelievers have some success, they say to them, \"Have we not earned your affection by defending you against those believers?\" God will judge between everyone on the Resurrection Day, and God will never allow the unbelievers to harm the believers"
  4,142,"The hypocrites try to deceive God, but it is He who causes them to be deceived. They rise to pray, they rise reluctantly, only to be seen and praised by men, seldom remembering God"
  4,143,"wavering between this and that, belonging neither to one side nor the other. If God let someone stray, [Prophet] you will never find a way for him"
  4,144,"Believers, do not take the unbelievers as allies and protectors instead of the believers. Do you want to offer God clear evidence of your guilt"
  4,145,"The hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of Hell, and you will find no one to help them"
  4,146,"except for those who repent, make amends, hold fast to God and are devoted in their faith to Him alone. They are one with the believers. God will grant a mighty reward to the believers"
  4,147,"Why should God punish you [for your past sins] if you become thankful and believe in Him? God is always responsive to gratitude and is All-Knowing"
