quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,17,"Be patient over what they say, and remember Our servant, David, the possessor of strength; he was one who repeatedly turned back [to Us]"
  38,18,We subjected the mountains to join him in praising Our limitless glory in the evening and daybreak
  38,19,"and the birds to assemble, all repeating [praises] with him"
  38,20,"And We strengthened his kingdom, and gave him wisdom and keen judgment"
  38,21,"And has the story come to you of the disputants who climbed over the wall of [his] prayer chamber"
  38,22,"When they entered upon David, he was alarmed, [but] they said, \"Do not be afraid. [We are] two disputants. One of us has wronged the other, so judge between us with truth, and do not be unjust, and guide us to the right way"
  38,23,"This is my brother. He has ninety-nine ewes, and I have one ewe, so he said, 'Entrust it to me,' and got the better of me with his words"
  38,24,"[David] said, \"He has certainly wronged you in demanding that your ewe be added to his ewes. And many associates oppress one another, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds, and they are few.\" David then realized that We had been testing him, and he asked forgiveness of his Lord, and fell down bowing [in prostration], and turned [to God] in repentance"
  38,25,"so We forgave him, and, he has nearness to Us, and a good place in the Hereafter"
  38,26,"[We said], \"David, We have made you a steward over this land, so judge between the people in truth and do not follow [your own] whim, as it will lead you away from the way of God.\" Those who wander away from His path will have a severe punishment for having forgotten the Day of Account"
