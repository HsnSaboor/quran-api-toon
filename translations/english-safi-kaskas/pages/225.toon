  11,31,"I do not say to you, 'God's treasures are with me,' nor [do I say], 'I have knowledge of what is hidden,' nor do I say, 'I am an angel,' nor do I say of those you hold in contempt, 'God will not grant them any good.' God is fully aware of what is in their hearts. If I did this, I would be among the unjust"
