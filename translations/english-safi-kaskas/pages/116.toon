quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,46,"We sent Jesus, the son of Mary, to follow in the footsteps of those earlier prophets, confirming what was available of the Torah. We gave him the Gospel. It has guidance and enlightenment, confirming what was available of the Torah. It has guidance and an admonition for those who are mindful of God"
  5,47,Let the followers of the Gospel judge according to what God has revealed in it. Those who do not judge in light of what God has revealed are deviators
  5,48,"[Prophet] We sent you the Book, setting forth the Truth, confirming what is available of earlier revelations and with final authority over them. Judge between them in accordance with what God has sent down. Do not follow their whims, which deviate from the Truth revealed to you.We have assigned to each of you a law and a way of life. If God had wanted, He could have made all of you a single community, but instead He is testing you by means of what He has revealed to you. So compete in doing what is good. You will all return to God, and He will clarify these matters about which you have differed"
  5,49,"[Prophet] Judge between them according to what God has revealed to them, and do not follow their whims. Be cautious. Do not let them tempt you away from what God has revealed to you. If they turn away, remember it is God's will to repay them for some of the sins they have committed. A great many people are deviators"
  5,50,Do they want judgment according to the age of ignorance? Is there any better judge than God for those who are firm in faith
