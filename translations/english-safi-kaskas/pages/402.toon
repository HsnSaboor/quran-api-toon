quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  29,46,"If you argue with the People of the Book, then argue only in the kindest way, except with those among them who are unjust, and say, \"We believe in what was revealed to us and in what was revealed to you. Our God and your God is one; and we are submissive to Him"
  29,47,"Hence, We have sent down the Book to you [Prophet]. Those to whom We previously gave the Book believe in it, and so do some of these [other] people. No one rejects Our revelations except those who deny an obvious truth"
  29,48,"You never recited any Book before We revealed this one to you, nor did you ever write one with your own hand. Otherwise, those who try to disprove the truth would have had cause for doubt"
  29,49,"Rather, the Qur'an is a clear message to the hearts of those who have been given knowledge. No one knowingly rejects Our verses except those who are unjust [to themselves]"
  29,50,"But they say, \"Why have no miracles been sent down to him from his Lord?\" Say, \"The miracles are only with God, and I am only sent to give you a clear warning"
  29,51,Isn't it enough for them that We inspired you to recite the Book to them? There is a mercy in this and a reminder for believing people
  29,52,"Say, \"God is sufficient witness between you and me. He knows what is in the heavens and earth. Those who believe in falsehood and deny God will be the losers"
