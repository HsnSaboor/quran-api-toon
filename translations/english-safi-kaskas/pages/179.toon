quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  8,17,"Believers, it was not you who killed the enemy, but God who killed them, and it was not you [Prophet] who threw terror into them but it was God who threw it, and He did all of this in order to test the believers. God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
  8,18,This is your reward. God will weaken the unbelievers' plots
  8,19,"Believers, if you have been praying for victory, it has now come to you. If you abstain from sin, it will be for your own good, but if you return to sin, We will withdraw Our promise of help and your community will be of no use to you, regardless of their numbers. God is only with those who believe"
  8,20,"Believers obey God and His Messenger and now that you hear His message, do not turn away from Him"
  8,21,"Do not be like those who say, \"We have heard,\" when they were not listening"

  8,23,"If God had seen any good in them, He would have made them hear, but even if He had, they would still have turned away and paid no attention"
  8,24,"Believers, respond to God and His Messenger whenever he calls you to that which will give you life. Know that God intervenes between a man and the desires of his heart and that you will be gathered to Him"
  8,25,Beware of discord that will not only afflict those who are unjust among you; and know that God is severe in punishment
