  26,185,"They said, \"You are surely bewitched"
  26,186,"You are a man like us, and we think you are a liar"
  26,187,"Make a fragment of the sky fall on us, if you are telling the truth"
  26,188,"He said, \"My Lord knows best what you are doing"
  26,189,"But they did not believe him, and the punishment of the day of shadow seized them truly, the punishment of a terrible day"
  26,190,"There is a sign in this, but most of them will not believe"
  26,191,"Truly your Lord is the Almighty, the Merciful-to-all"
  26,192,"This [Qur'an] is the revelation sent as you received it from the Lord of the worlds"
  26,193,and brought down by The Trustworthy Spirit
  26,194,"to your heart, that you may (Prophet] be of the warners"

  26,196,It is mentioned in the scriptures of the ancients
  26,197,Is it not a sign that the scholars of the Children of Israel knew it
  26,198,Yet even if We had revealed it to a non-Arab
  26,199,"and he had recited it to them, they would still not believe in it"
  26,200,This is how We make it go unheeded through the hearts of those who force others to reject Our messages

  26,202,"that will come upon them suddenly, when they do not expect it"
  26,203,"They will say, \"May we have more time"
  26,204,Why do they ask that we hasten Our punishment
  26,205,"Do you see that, if We gave them years of enjoyment"
