quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,152,"Stay away from the property of orphans, except to improve it, until he or she comes of age.\" Give full measure and weight in accordance with equity. We do not burden any soul with more than it is able to bear. When you voice an opinion, be just, even if it concerns a relative. Fulfill your pledge to God. This is what He has commanded you to do so that you will remember"
  6,153,"This is My Straight Path; Follow it, and do not follow any other way, because it will cause you to deviate from it. This is what He commands you, so that you will be mindful of Him"
  6,154,"Then, We gave Moses the Book, complete and perfect or those who do good, clearly explaining everything, a guidance and mercy, so that they may have faith in their encounter with their Lord"
  6,155,"This, too, is a blessed Book which We have sent down: follow it and be mindful of God, so that you might be graced with His mercy"
  6,156,"so that you do not say, \"a Book was only sent down to two groups before our time and we're unaware of their teachings"
  6,157,"or, so that you do not say, \"If a Book had been sent down to us, we would have followed its guidance better than they did.\" Clear evidence, guidance and mercy has come to you from your Lord. Who could be more unjust than someone who rejects God's messages and turns away in contempt? We will recompense those who turn away from Our verses with the worst of punishment for their having turned away"
