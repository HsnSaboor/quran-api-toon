quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,77,"Say, \"People of the Book, do not overstep the bounds of Truth in your religious beliefs. Do not follow the whims of the people who went astray before you. They have led many others astray, and they continue to stray from the right path"
  5,78,"Those of the Children of Israel who defied God and denied the truth, have been cursed and rejected by the words of David and Jesus, the son of Mary, because they rebelled and persistently overstepped the limits"
  5,79,They did not prevent each other from doing hateful things. Their deeds were so evil
  5,80,"You [Prophet] see many of them allying themselves with the unbelievers. How evil is what their souls make them do! God has condemned them, and they will remain in punishment forever"
  5,81,"If they [truly] believed in God and their Prophet and all that was sent down to them, they would not take the unbelievers for their allies: but most of them are defiant"
  5,82,"You [Prophet] are sure to find that the most hostile to the believers are the Jews as well as those who are bent on ascribing partners to God. While, you will find that the nearest in affection towards the believers are those who say, \"We are Christians,\" because there are priests and monks among them, and because these people are not given to arrogance"
