quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  12,31,"When she heard about their gossip, she sent for them, and prepared a banquet for them, and handed each of them a knife. She said [to Joseph], \"Come out before them.\" When the women saw him, they were awestruck [by his beauty] and [so flustered that] they cut their hands [with their knives], saying, \"God save us. This is not a mortal man. He must be a precious angel"
  12,32,"She said, \"Here is the one you blamed me for. I sought to seduce him, but he firmly refused. Now, if he does not do what I order, he will be put in prison and will be humiliated"
  12,33,"He said, \"Lord, prison is more desirable to me than what these women are inviting me to do. If you do not protect me from their treachery, I might yield to their allure and so become one of the ignorant"
  12,34,"His Lord responded to his prayer and protected him from their treachery. He alone is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
  12,35,"It occurred to the governor and his household after they had seen all the signs [of Joseph's innocence] that they should imprison him for a while"
  12,36,"Two young men happened to go to prison at the same time as Joseph. One of them said, \"I saw myself [in a dream] pressing wine.\" The other said, \"I saw myself [in a dream] carrying bread on my head, and birds were eating it.\" (They said to Joseph,] \"Tell us the real meaning of this. We see that you are a knowledgeable man"
  12,37,"[Joseph] answered, \"I will inform you of the interpreted meaning of your dreams before your meal arrives, for this is [part] of the knowledge which my Lord has taught me. I have left behind the way of people who do not believe in God and who persistently deny the truth of the life to come"
