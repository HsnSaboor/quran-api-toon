  9,94,"They will offer you excuses when you return. Say, \"Do not give us any excuses, we will not believe you. God has already told us about you. God will be watching your deeds, and so will His Messenger, and, in the end, you will be brought before Him the Knower of the unknown and the known. He will make you truly understand [the negative impact of] what you were doing"
  9,95,"[Believers], when you return to them, they will swear by God in order to make you leave them alone. Leave them alone. They are despicable, and their destiny is Hell, fit payment for their actions"
  9,96,They will swear to you to in order to make you accept them. God will never accept those who are defiantly disobedient
  9,97,"The Bedouins are the most hypocritical and stubborn in [their] rejection of faith and the least likely to comprehend the limits [of laws] that God has sent down to His Messenger. God knows everything, and He is wise"
  9,98,"Among the Bedouins, there are some who consider what they spend [in God's cause] to be a loss and expect that you will run into trouble, but it is they who will be overwhelmed by trouble. God hears everything and knows everything"
  9,99,"Yet, there are also Bedouins who believe in God and the Last Day and regard everything they spend [in God's cause] to be means of drawing them closer to God and the Messenger's prayers. It will definitely bring them nearer to God, admitting them to His mercy. God is forgiving and Merciful-to-all"
