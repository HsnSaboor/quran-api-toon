quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,"even though they can see each other. The one who forced others to reject Our messages will wish he could ransom himself from the punishment of that Day, by sacrificing his children"
  70,12,and his wife and his brother
  70,13,and his family who shelter him
  70,14,"and everyone on earth, if that could save him"
  70,15,Not today! But a raging blaze
  70,16,that strips away the skin
  70,17,and claims everyone who turned his back to the truth and went away
  70,18,"and accumulated and hoarded [wealth]"
  70,19,The Human being was created full of anxiety
  70,20,desperate when bad things happen
  70,21,but tight-fisted when good fortune comes his way
  70,22,The exception are those who pray
  70,23,those who are steady in their prayer
  70,24,and those who have set aside a known rightful share within their wealth
  70,25,for the poor and the deprived
  70,26,and those who believe in the Day of Judgment
  70,27,and those who dread their Lord's punishment
  70,28,They know not to take their Lord's punishment for granted
  70,29,Those who guard their chastity
  70,30,"except from their spouses and from those whom their right hands hold in trust, are free of blame"
  70,31,"But whoever seeks beyond that, they are transgressors"
  70,32,Those who honor their trusts and pledges
  70,33,and those who stand by their testimonies
  70,34,and those who maintain their prayer with dedication
  70,35,those will be honored in Gardens
  70,36,"So what is [the matter] with the unbelievers? They run about in front of you in groups, with outstretched necks and staring eyes"
  70,37,"from the right, and from the left"
  70,38,Does each one of them aspire to enter the Garden of Delight
  70,39,Never! We have created them from that which they well know
