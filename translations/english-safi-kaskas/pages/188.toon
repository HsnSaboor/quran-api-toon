quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,7,"How can there be a treaty between God and His Messenger with the idolaters, except for those with whom you made a treaty at the Sacred House? As long as they remain true to you, be true to them. God loves those who are mindful of Him"
  9,8,"What sort of a treaty is this, since, if they gain the upper hand, they would not respect any agreement or obligation to protect [you]. They please you with what they say, while their hearts remain averse [to you]. Most of them are disobedient"
  9,9,They have sold God's messages for small change and have turned others away from His path. What they have done is truly evil
  9,10,"They respect neither kinship nor treaty with believers, and it is they who are offenders"
  9,11,"If they repent, and pray, and pay the prescribed purifying alms, they become your brothers in faith; We spell out these messages clearly for people who understand"
  9,12,"If they violate their oaths after having made a treaty with you and condemn your faith, then fight against these leaders of ungodliness, who have no regard for their own oaths, so that they will stop their aggression"
  9,13,"Won't you fight against people who have broken their solemn oaths, and done all they can to drive the Messenger out, and attacked you first? Are you afraid of them? It is God whom you should fear if you are [truly] believers"
