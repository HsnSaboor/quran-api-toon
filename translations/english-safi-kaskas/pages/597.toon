quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the fig and the olive
  95,2,"and [by] Mount Sinai"
  95,3,"and [by] this secure city [Mecca]"
  95,4,We have certainly created the human being in the best of stature
  95,5,Then We return him to the lowest of the low
  95,6,"except for those who believe and do righteous deeds, for they will have an uninterrupted reward"
  95,7,"So, do you still deny this faith"
  95,8,Isn't God the most Just of Judges
  96,1,Recite in the name of your Lord who created
  96,2,created the human being from a clinging substance
  96,3,"Recite, and your Lord is the most generous"
  96,4,Who taught by the pen
  96,5,He taught the human being that which he knew not
  96,6,"No! [But] indeed, the human being transgresses"
  96,7,because he sees himself self-sufficient
  96,8,"Indeed, to your Lord is the return"
  96,9,Have you seen the one who forbids
  96,10,a servant from praying
  96,11,"Have you seen if he is on [the road of] guidance"
  96,12,Or enjoins righteousness
  96,13,Have you seen if he rejects and turns away
  96,14,Does he not know that God sees
  96,15,"No! If he doesn't stop, We will surely drag him by the forelock"
  96,16,"a lying, sinning forelock"
  96,17,Then let him call his associates
  96,18,We will call the angels of Hell
  96,19,"No! Do not obey him. But prostrate yourselves and draw near [to God]"
