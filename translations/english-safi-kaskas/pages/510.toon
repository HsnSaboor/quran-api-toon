  47,31,"We will test you, until We know those who strive among you, and those who are patient, and We will test the sincerity of your assertions"
  47,32,"The unbelievers who turn others away from the path of God and oppose the Messenger after guidance has become clear to them, will not hurt God in the least, but He will render their deeds worthless"

  47,36,"This worldly life is only amusement and pastime. But if you believe and become mindful of God, He will give you your rewards and not ask you for your properties"
  47,37,"Were He to ask you for them and put you under pressure, you would become tightfisted, and He would expose your unwillingness"
  47,38,"Here you are, called upon to spend in the cause of God. Among you are those who are tightfisted; but whoever withholds only withholds from his own soul. God is the Rich Beyond Need, while you are the needy. And if you turn away, He will replace you with another people, and they will not be the likes of you"
