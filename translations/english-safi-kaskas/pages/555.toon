quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"And when It is said to them, \"Come, the Messenger of God will ask forgiveness for you,\" they turn their heads aside in contempt and you see them turning away arrogantly"
  63,6,It is all the same for them whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them; God will not forgive them. God does not guide such defiantly disobedient people
  63,7,"It is they who say, \"Give nothing to those who follow God's Messenger, until they dispersed from around him.\" To God belongs the treasuries of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not understand"
  63,8,"They say, \"If we return to Medina, the more worthy will drive out the disgraced.\" But all worth belongs to God, His Messenger, and the believers; though the hypocrites do not know it"
  63,9,"Believers, let neither your wealth nor your children distract you from remembering to call upon God. Whoever does that are the doomed"
  63,10,"Give from what We have provided for you, before death comes to one of you, and he says, \"My Lord, if You would only delay me for a little while, so that I may be charitable, and be among the righteous"
  63,11,But God will never delay a soul when its time has come. God is well aware of what you do
