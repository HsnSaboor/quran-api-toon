quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,138,"We brought the children of Israel across the sea, where they came across people who were devoted to worshipping idols. [The children of Israel] said, \"Moses, give us a god like the gods they have.\" He replied, \"You are ignorant people"
  7,139,"As for these here, what they are doing is doomed to destruction; and all that they have ever done is falsehood"
  7,140,"He said, \"Why should I seek for you a god other than God, since it is He who has favored you above all other people"
  7,141,"[He reminded them of the word of God], \"We saved you from Pharaoh's people who caused you cruel suffering, killing your sons in great numbers and sparing [only] your women, which was an awesome test from your Lord"
  7,142,"We made an appointment for thirty nights [on Mount Sinai] for Moses, and We then added ten to them. The term set by his Lord was fulfilled in forty nights. Moses said to his brother Aaron, \"Take my place among my people and act righteously, and do not follow the path of those that spread corruption"
  7,143,"When Moses came at the appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, \"My Lord, show [Yourself] to me, so that I might see You.\" [God] said, \"You can never see Me. However, behold this mountain. If it remains firm in its place, then you will see Me.\" As soon as his Lord revealed His limitless glory to the mountain, He caused it to crumble to dust and Moses fell down unconscious. After he recovered, he said, \"May You be exalted in Your glory! I repent! I will be the first of the believers"
