quran[3]{c,v,t}:
  24,59,"And when your children reach puberty, let them ask your permission to enter, just as those before them have done. In this way God makes His messages clear to you, for God is All-Knowing and All-Wise"
  24,60,"As for elderly women who have no desire to marry-there is no blame upon them if they remove their outer garments without displaying their charms, but, to modestly refrain [from that] is better for them, for God is All-Hearing and All-Knowing"
  24,61,"There is not any restriction on the blind, the lame, the ill or yourselves when you eat from your [own] houses or the houses of your fathers, your mothers, your brothers, your sisters, your father's brothers, your father's sisters, your mother's brothers, your mother's sisters or [from houses] whose keys you possess, or from any of your friends' houses. There is nothing wrong with your eating [either] together or separately, but, when you enter any house, give greetings of peace upon each other, a greeting from God, blessed and good. In this way God makes His messages clear to you so that you may understand"
