quran[3]{c,v,t}:
  2,257,"God protects believers and brings them out of the darkness of ignorance into enlightenment. False gods are the protectors of the unbelievers, bringing them out of enlightenment into the darkness of ignorance. They will be eternally in Hell"
  2,258,"Have you not considered the one who was given a kingship by God [and] then disputed with Abram about his Lord? Abram said, \"My Lord gives life and causes death.\" He said, \"I also give life and death.\" Abram said, \"God brings the sun from the East. So bring it from the West.\" The disbeliever was dumfounded. God does not guide unjust people"
  2,259,"Or, [consider] the one who passed by a town which had fallen into ruin. He said, \"How can God bring back those who were once alive here after their death?\" God made him die for a hundred years, and then resurrected him. He said, \"How long have you stayed?\" He said, \"A day or part of a day.\" He said, \"You stayed for a hundred years. Look at your food and your drink. They have not gone bad. Look at your dead donkey. We will make you a sign for people. Look how We raise the bones, and then cover them with flesh.\" When he saw it, he said, \"I know that God has power over all things"
