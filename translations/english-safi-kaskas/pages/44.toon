quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,260,"Abram said, \"My Lord, show me how you give life to the dead.\" God said, \"Have you not believed?\" He said, \"Yes I have, but assure my heart.\" God said, \"Take four birds, kill them and cut them into pieces. Then put pieces of each on a mountain and call them. They will come quickly to you. Know that God is Strong and Wise"
  2,261,"Those who contribute their money in God's way are like a seed that sprouts seven heads, in each of which are a hundred grains. God grants such multiple increase to whom He wills. God is Infinite and All-Knowing"
  2,262,Those who spend their money in God's way and then do not follow what they spend with reproach or harm will have a reward from their Lord. They will neither fear nor grieve
  2,263,A kind word and forgiveness are better than charity followed by hurt. God is Rich beyond need and Forbearing
  2,264,Believers do not ruin your charitable deeds with reproach and harm like one who does not believe in God or the Last Day and contributes his money so people will see him. He is like a rock with dirt on it that was rained upon heavily and became hard and bare. Such people can do nothing with what they earned. God does not guide disbelieving people
