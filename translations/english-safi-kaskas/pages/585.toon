quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and turned away
  80,2,when the blind man approached him
  80,3,"For all you know, he might be seeking to purify himself"
  80,4,or to be reminded and be helped by being reminded
  80,5,As for him who was indifferent
  80,6,"you [Prophet] gave him your attention"
  80,7,Though it is not up to you whether or not he is purified
  80,8,As for him who came to you eagerly
  80,9,with God's fear in his heart
  80,10,from him you are distracted
  80,11,Indeed this is a reminder
  80,12,"So, whoever wills may remember it"
  80,13,"it is [written] on honored sheets"
  80,14,Exalted and purified
  80,15,by the hands of scribes
  80,16,honorable and virtuous
  80,17,How regretful it is for people to have so much self-destructive ingratitude
  80,18,From what did He create him
  80,19,From a fertilized ovum He created him and proportioned him
  80,20,Then He eased the way for him
  80,21,Then He causes him to die and to be buried
  80,22,"Then when He wills, He will resurrect him"
  80,23,No! He did not fulfill what He has commanded him
  80,24,A human being has only to consider the food he eats
  80,25,We poured down water in abundance
  80,26,and caused the soil to break open
  80,27,and grew grains in it
  80,28,and grapes and legumes
  80,29,olive and dates
  80,30,and luxurious gardens
  80,31,and fruits and vegetable
  80,32,for you and your livestock to enjoy
  80,33,But when the Deafening Blast comes
  80,34,on the Day when a human being will flee from his brother
  80,35,"his mother, his father"
  80,36,his wife and his children
  80,37,"every one of them, on that Day, will have enough to preoccupy him"
  80,38,Faces on that Day will be beaming
  80,39,laughing and rejoicing
  80,40,"And [other] faces, on that Day, will be covered with dust"
  80,41,overwhelmed by sorrow
  80,42,"These are the unbelievers, the wicked ones"
