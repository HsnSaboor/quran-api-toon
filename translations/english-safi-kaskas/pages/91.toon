quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,80,Whoever obeys the Messenger obeys God. We have not sent you to be the keeper for those who turn away
  4,81,"They say, \"We obey you [Prophet],\" but when they leave your presence, some of them plot during the night to disobey you. God records what they plot. Ignore them, and place your trust in God, for none is as worthy of trust as God"
  4,82,"Will they not, at least, try to understand this Qur'an? If it had been from anyone but God, they would have found many inconsistencies in it"
  4,83,"Whenever a rumor pertaining to peace or war comes to them, they broadcast it. But had they referred it to the Messenger and to the believers who were in charge, they would have understood it and made sense of it. If it were not for God's favor and mercy on you, most of you would have followed Satan"
  4,84,"So, [Messenger] fight in the cause of God. You are responsible only for yourself. Rally the believers, because God may well curb the strength of the unbelievers. God is stronger in might and in His ability to destroy"
  4,85,Whoever rallies for a good cause will share in its benefits; and whoever rallies for an evil cause will answer for his part in it. God watches everything
  4,86,"When you are greeted with a greeting, answer with an even better greeting, or [at least] respond with the same greeting. God keeps account of everything"
