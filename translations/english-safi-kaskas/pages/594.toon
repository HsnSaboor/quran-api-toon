quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  89,24,"He will say, \"I wish I had provided for this life to come"
  89,25,"On that Day, none will punish as He punishes"
  89,26,And none will shackle as severely as He shackles
  89,27,"[To the righteous it will be said], \"Tranquil soul"
  89,28,"Return to your Lord, well-pleased and pleasing [to Him]"
  89,29,go in among My worshipers
  89,30,and into My Garden
  90,1,I swear by this town
  90,2,"and you [Prophet] are free to dwell in this town"
  90,3,"And [I swear by] a father and his offspring"
  90,4,We have created human being for a life of hardship
  90,5,Does he thinks that no one will have power over him
  90,6,"I have wasted much money,\" he says"
  90,7,Does he think that no one sees him
  90,8,Have We not given him two eyes
  90,9,And a tongue and two lips
  90,10,"and have shown him the two ways [of good and evil]"
  90,11,But he did not take the difficult path
  90,12,And how would you know what is the difficult path
  90,13,It is to free a slave
  90,14,or to feed on a day of hunger
  90,15,an orphaned relative
  90,16,or a needy person in distress
  90,17,Then to become one of those who believe and urge one another to endure and to urge each other to be compassionate
  90,18,Those are the people of righteousness
  90,19,But those who defy Our revelations are the people of despair
  90,20,With the fire closing in above them
