quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,116,"As for the unbelievers, neither their wealth nor their children will be of benefit to them before God. They are destined to Hell, where they will remain eternally"
  3,117,"The parable of what they spend in this worldly life is like a freezing wind that blew on a field belonging to people who wronged themselves, and it destroyed it. God did not cheat them, but they cheated themselves"
  3,118,"Believers do not be close friends to outsiders who spare no effort to ruin you and want to see you suffer. Their hatred is apparent in what they say, and what their hearts hide is even worse. We have made Our revelations clear to you, if you would only use your reason"
  3,119,"Here you are loving them, but they do not love you. You believe in the entire Book, and when they meet you, they say, \"We believe.\" When they depart, they bite their fingers in rage against you. Say, \"Perish in you rage. God knows what is in your hearts"
  3,120,"If goodness befalls you, they are displeased, and if evil, then they rejoice. If you endure and are godly, their plots will not harm you at all. God surrounds all they do"
  3,121,"Remember, Prophet, when you left your family at dawn to post the believers at their battle stations, knowing that God hears all and knows all"
