quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  33,7,"We took a pledge from the prophets: from you and from Noah, and Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus, the Son of Mary. We took a solemn pledge from them"
  33,8,"so that God may question the truthful about their sincerity. And, for the unbelievers He has prepared a painful punishment"
  33,9,"Believers, remember God's blessings to you when armies came to [attack] you, and We sent a wind and forces that you could not see. God always sees what you do"
  33,10,"When they [the enemy] came at you from above you and from below you, when eyes rolled [in fear], and your hearts rose to your throats, and you had [ill] thoughts of God"
  33,11,"there, the believers were tested and severely shaken"
  33,12,"The hypocrites and the sick at heart said, \"The promise from God and His Messenger is a fantasy"
  33,13,"and a faction of them said, \"People of Yathrib, there is nothing for you [here], so return [home].\" Yet another group asked permission of the Prophet, saying, \"Our houses are exposed,\" although, in fact they were not. They intended only to flee"
  33,14,"Had their town been invaded from every side, and they had been exhorted to revert to idolatry, [the hypocrites] would have done so with very little hesitation"
  33,15,even though they had already pledged before God not to turn back and flee. One is always responsible for a promise made before God
