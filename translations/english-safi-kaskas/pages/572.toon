  72,2,"It guides to righteousness, and we have believed it: We will never assign divinity to anyone except our Lord"
  72,3,And exalted be the glory of our Lord! He never had a spouse nor a child
  72,4,But the fools among us had been saying outrageous things about God
  72,5,although we had thought that no human or jinn would dare tell a lie about God
  72,6,"Some individual humans used to seek power through some individual jinn, but they [the jinn] only increased their confusion"
  72,7,"And they thought, as you thought, that God would not send anyone [as a messenger]"
  72,8,"We as usual probed heaven [in search of news], and found it filled with fierce guards and projectiles"

  72,10,"We do not know therefore whether ill is intended for those on earth, or whether their Lord intends to guide them"
  72,11,"Some of us are righteous, but others are less so; we follow different paths"
