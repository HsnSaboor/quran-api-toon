quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  76,6,"a spring from which God's worshipers shall drink, making it gush abundantly at will"
  76,7,They are the ones who fulfill their vows and fear a Day whose evil will be widespread
  76,8,"They feed the needy, the orphan, and the prisoner, for the love of Him"
  76,9,"[Saying], \"We feed you for the sake of God. We want neither compensation, nor gratitude from you"
  76,10,We simply dread an austere and stressful Day promised by our Lord
  76,11,So God will spare them the evil of that Day and will give them radiance and joy
  76,12,and will reward them for what they patiently endured with a Garden and silk
  76,13,reclining there on couches. They will not experience there either burning sun or bitter cold
  76,14,"Shades cover them, and its fruit hanging close ready to be picked"
  76,15,"Circulated among them are vessels of silver, and cups of pure crystal"
  76,16,clear glasses made from silver according to their own measure
  76,17,They will be given a drink mixed with ginger
  76,18,from a spring there named Salsabeel
  76,19,"Passing among them are immortal youths. If you see them, you would think they were like sprinkled pearls"
  76,20,"If you were to look around, you would see a heavenly and vast kingdom"
  76,21,They will wear green garments of fine silk and brocade. And they will be adorned with silver bracelets. Their Lord will give them a purified drink
  76,22,This is a reward for you. Your efforts are well appreciated
  76,23,It is We who have sent down the Qur'an to you in gradual revelations
  76,24,So await your Lord's Judgment with patience; and do not obey a sinner or a denier of the truth from among them
  76,25,Remember to call on the name of your Lord morning and evening
