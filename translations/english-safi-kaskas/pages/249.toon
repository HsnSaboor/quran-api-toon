quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  13,1,"Alif Lam Meem Ra, these are the verses of the Book, and what has been sent down to you from your Lord is the Truth, yet most people will not believe"
  13,2,"It is God Who has raised the heavens without any visible supports and then He settled on the Throne of His majesty. He has made the sun and the moon subservient [to His laws], each ordained by Him to run its course for an appointed time. He governs everything that exists. He clearly explains these messages, so that you can be sure that you are destined to meet your Lord [on Judgment Day]"
  13,3,"He has spread the earth wide, placed firm mountains and running waters on it, and created two of every kind of fruit , [and He] causes the night to cover the day. Surely there are messages in all of this for people to contemplate"
  13,4,"There are, on earth, neighboring plots, gardens of vineyards, crops, date palm trees sharing the same root or alone. They are all watered with the same water, yet We make some better tasting than others. Surely there are messages in all of this for people who use their reason"
  13,5,"And if you are astonished [at God's creation], then it is [equally] astonishing to hear them [doubters] say, \"Once we are dust, will we [really] be created anew?\" These are the ones who have denied the truth about their Lord, and who will have shackles around their necks, and are in the fire, where they will reside eternally"
