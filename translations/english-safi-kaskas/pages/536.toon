  56,51,"Then you, you who are misguided and reject the truth"
  56,52,will be eating from trees of Zaqqum
  56,53,You will be filling your bellies with it
  56,54,drinking boiling water on top of it
  56,55,drinking it like thirsty camels
  56,56,That will be their welcome on Judgment Day
  56,57,"We created you, so why you do not believe"
  56,58,Have you seen the semen which you ejaculate
  56,59,"Is it you who creates it, or are We the Creator"
  56,60,"We have decreed death among you, and nothing can stop Us"
  56,61,if We want to replace you and to recreate you in a way that you know nothing about
  56,62,"You have already known the first creation, so will you not remember"
  56,63,Have you seen what you cultivate
  56,64,"Is it you who makes it grow, or are We the grower"

  56,66,"[Saying], \"we are now in debt"

  56,69,"Is it you who sent it down from the clouds, or are We the Sender"
  56,70,"If We wish, We can make it bitter, why then you are not grateful"
  56,71,And have you seen the fire that you kindle
  56,72,"Is it you who produced its tree, or are We the Producer"
  56,73,We have made it a reminder and provision for all who kindle it
  56,74,"exalt, then, the glory of your Lord's Name; the Magnificent"
  56,75,I swear by the positioning of the stars
  56,76,"a tremendous oath, if you only knew"
