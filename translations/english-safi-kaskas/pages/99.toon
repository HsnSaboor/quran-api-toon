quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,128,"If a woman has reason to fear ill-treatment or even a lack of interest from her husband, neither of them will be blamed if they come to a peaceful settlement, for peace is best.

  4,129,"You will never be able to treat your wives with equal fairness, regardless of how much you desire to do so.

  4,132,"Everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to God, and He is sufficient for those who trust in Him"
  4,133,"If He's willing, He can cause all of you to disappear and replace you with new people: God is fully capable of doing this"
  4,134,"If someone desires the rewards of this world, the rewards of this world and the next are both God's to give. God hears and sees everything"
