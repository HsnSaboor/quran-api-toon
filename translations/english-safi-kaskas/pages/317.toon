  20,77,"We revealed to Moses, \"Travel by night with My worshipers and strike a dry path through the sea for them, and do not fear being overtaken [by Pharaoh] or fear [drowning]"
  20,78,"So Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers, and they were utterly overwhelmed by the sea"
  20,79,"Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide [them]"
  20,80,"O Children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy, and We made a covenant with you on the right side of the mountain, and We repeatedly sent down manna and quail to you"
  20,81,"[saying], \"Eat from the good things which We have provided you, but do not abuse them or I will be angry with you. And he with whom I am angry will certainly fall"
  20,82,"Yet I am most forgiving towards those who repent, believe, do righteous deeds, and stay on the right path"

  20,87,"They said, \"We did not break our promise to you deliberately, but we were weighed down with the heavy burden of the people's jewelry so we threw them [into the fire], following what the Samaritan did"
