quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,Those who do not believe in the Hereafter give the angels female names
  53,28,they have no knowledge of this. They only follow guesswork. Guesswork is no substitute at all for the Truth
  53,29,So pay no attention to whoever turns away from Our message and desires only this worldly life
  53,30,"That is the extent of their knowledge. Your Lord knows best who strayed from His path, and He knows best who is guided"
  53,31,"To God belongs everything in the heavens and on earth. He will repay those who do evil according to their deeds, and reward those who do good with the best"
  53,32,"those who avoid major sins and indecencies, except for minor lapses excepted; your Lord's forgiveness is vast. He knows you well, ever since He created you from the earth and ever since you were embryos in your mothers' wombs. So do not attest to your own virtues; He knows best those who are mindful of Him"
  53,33,Have you seen the one who turned away
  53,34,and gave a little and then held back
  53,35,"Does he have knowledge of all that is beyond, enabling him to see the future"
  53,36,Or has he not been told what was in the scrolls of Moses
  53,37,"and [of] Abraham, who fulfilled his duty"
  53,38,that no bearer of burdens will bear the burdens of another
  53,39,that a human being attains only what he strives for
  53,40,and that his striving will be seen
  53,41,Then he will receive for it the fullest reward
  53,42,The ultimate end is to your Lord
  53,43,"that It is He who causes [one] to laugh and weep"
  53,44,That it is He who causes death and gives life
