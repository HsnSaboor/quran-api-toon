quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,"Is one whose heart God has opened to submit to Him and who has received enlightenment from his Lord [like one whose heart rejects God]? Misery, then, to those whose hearts are hardened even more by the mention of God. They are clearly lost"
  39,23,"God has sent down the best of narrations: a Book that is perfectly consistent within itself, repeating various statements [of the Truth] in forms that causes the skin of those who revere their Lord to shiver [in awe], after which their skin and their hearts soften at the mention of God. Such is God's guidance; He guides with it [the Qur'an] whoever is willing to be guided, but no one can guide those God leaves to stray"
  39,24,"What about someone who shields his face against the worst of punishment on the Day of Resurrection [is he like one secure from it]? [On that day] it will be said to the unjust, \"Taste what you have earned"
  39,25,"Those before them also denied the truth, and punishment came upon them before they realize what is happening"
  39,26,"God made them taste disgrace in this worldly life, but the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew"
  39,27,"We have cited in this Qur'an every [kind of] example for people, so that they might remember"
  39,28,"[It is] an Arabic Qur'an, without any distortion, so that they might become mindful"
  39,29,"[To this end], God presents an example: [consider] a man owned by quarreling partners, and another [who is] devoted exclusively to one master, are they considered equal in status? All praise be to God! But most of them do not know"
  39,30,"You will die, and they will die"
  39,31,"Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will dispute with each other before your Lord"
