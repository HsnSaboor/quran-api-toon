quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  55,68,"In them are fruits, date-palms and pomegranates"
  55,69,So which of your Lord's blessings will you deny
  55,70,In them are sweet and lovely creatures
  55,71,So which of your Lord's blessings will you deny
  55,72,"Hoor, kept close in their pavilions"
  55,73,So which of your Lord's blessings will you deny
  55,74,Untouched before them by man or jinn
  55,75,So which of your Lord's blessings will you deny
  55,76,Reclining on green cushions and beautiful fine carpets
  55,77,So which of your Lord's blessings will you deny
  55,78,"Blessed be the name of your Lord, full of Majesty and Glory"
  56,1,When the Inevitable Event occurs
  56,2,no one will deny its occurrence
  56,3,Lowering some and raising others
  56,4,When the earth is shaken violently
  56,5,and the mountains are crushed and crumble
  56,6,and become scattered dust
  56,7,"then you [human beings] will be divided into three separate groups"
  56,8,Those on the right. What of those on the right
  56,9,And those on the left. What of those on the left
  56,10,And those who are ahead upfront
  56,11,they are the ones brought near
  56,12,in the Gardens of Bliss
  56,13,They are a large group of the earlier generations
  56,14,and a few of later generations
  56,15,They recline on luxurious woven couches
  56,16,"Reclining on them, facing each other"
