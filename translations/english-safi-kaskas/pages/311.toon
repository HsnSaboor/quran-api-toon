quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Have you considered the man who denies the truth of Our signs and says, \"I will surely be given wealth and children"
  19,78,"Has he received extrasensory knowledge, or has he received a pledge from the Merciful"
  19,79,No! We will record what he says and extend the duration of his punishment
  19,80,"And We will inherit from him the things he's talks about, and he will come to Us alone"
  19,81,"And they have taken gods other than God, hoping that they would be [a source of] strength for them"
  19,82,No! Those deities will reject their worship and will even turn against them
  19,83,"Do you not see that We have sent the devils to the unbelievers, inciting them to sin"
  19,84,So do not try to expedite their punishment. We are simply counting down the number of their days
  19,85,"On the Day [of Judgment,] We will gather all the righteous as [an honored] delegation to the Merciful"
  19,86,and will drive those who forced others to reject Our messages to Hell like a thirsty herd
  19,87,"None will have [power to] intercede on their behalf except him who has received permission from the Merciful"
  19,88,"And they say, \"The Merciful-to-all has taken [for Himself] a son"
  19,89,You have done an atrocious thing
  19,90,"It almost causes the heavens to rupture, the earth to split open and the mountains to collapse in devastation"
  19,91,that they attribute a son to the Merciful
  19,92,It does not befit the Merciful to take a son
  19,93,There is no one in the heavens and earth who will not come as a servant to the Merciful
  19,94,He has numbered them and counted them precisely
  19,95,so that every one of them will appear alone before Him on the Day of Resurrection
