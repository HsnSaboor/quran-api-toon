quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,23,"Intercession does not work with Him except when He permits it. [But, on the day of Judgment,] when the terror is removed from their hearts, they will say [to one another], \"What has your Lord said?\" They will say, \"The truth.\" And He is the Most High, the Most Great"
  34,24,"Say, \"Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?\"\" Say, \"God does. Then either we or you are rightly guided or clearly lost"
  34,25,"Say, \"You will not be asked about what we have done, and we will not be asked about what you do"
  34,26,"Say, \"Our Lord will bring us together; then He will judge between us in Truth, for He is the All-knowing, the Just Decider"
  34,27,"Say, \"Show me those whom you have joined to Him as partners. No! Rather, He [alone] is God, the Almighty, the Wise"
  34,28,"And We have sent you to all people as bearer of good news and to deliver a warning, but most people do not know"
  34,29,"And they say, \"When is this promise coming, if you are truthful"
  34,30,"Say, \"You have an appointment for a Day which you cannot delay nor bring forward even by a single hour"
  34,31,"Those who deny the truth say, \"We will never believe in this Qur'an or in what came before it.\" But if only you could see when the unjust are made to stand before their Lord, blaming each other; those who were thought weak will say to those who had been arrogant, \"Had it not been for you, we would have been believers"
