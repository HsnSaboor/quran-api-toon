quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  16,88,"We will heap punishment upon punishment on all the unbelievers who turned others away from God's path, in return for the corruption they caused"
  16,89,"On that day We will raise up from within each nation a witness against them, and We will bring you [Prophet] as a witness against them. We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things and as guidance and mercy and good news to all who would surrender themselves to God [Muslims]"
  16,90,"God orders justice, good works, and generosity to relatives and He forbids vice, evil, and oppression. He warns you so that you will keep all this in mind"
  16,91,"Fulfill the covenant of God whenever you commit to one. Do not break your oaths once they are confirmed, and you [will] have made God your guarantor. God knows all that you do"
  16,92,"And do not be like the woman who untwisted the thread she had firmly spun just to unravel it-do not use your oaths as means to deceive one another, because some of you are more powerful than others. God is testing you through all this, and on the Day of Resurrection He will make clear to you those things about which you disagreed"
  16,93,"Had God so desired, he could surely have made you all the same nation, but He lets stray those who wish to reject His messages, and He guides rightly those who wish to be guided, and all of you will be called to account for all things you have done"
