quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,75,"How could you refuse to fight in God's cause for the helpless men, women and children who are screaming, \"Lord! Lead us towards freedom, out of this land of oppressors! Through your grace, give us a protector and a helper"
  4,76,"The believers fight for God's cause, whereas those who are bent on denying the truth fight for the cause of evil. Fight the allies of Satan. Satan's tactics are truly weak"
  4,77,"[Prophet], are you not aware of those who have been told, \"Refrain from fighting, perform prayer, and pay the purifying alms?\" However, as soon as the fighting is ordained for them, some of them feared men even more than they feared God, saying, \"Lord, why have You ordained fighting for us? If only You would give us just a little more time?\" Say to them, \"The enjoyment of this world is brief, whereas the life to come is far better for those who are mindful of God. You will not be wronged, not even a little bit"
  4,78,"Wherever you may be, death will overtake you, even if you are in high protected towers. When good fortune happens to them, some [people] say, \"This is from God,\" whereas when harm comes to them, they say, \"This is from you [Prophet].\" Tell them, \"Both come from God.\" What is the matter with these people? They hardly understand what they are told"
  4,79,"Anything good that happens to you is from God, and whatever evil happens to you is from yourself. We have sent you as a Prophet to all people, and it is enough that God is your witness"
