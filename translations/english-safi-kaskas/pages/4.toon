quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"They are like one who lights a fire, and when it shines around him, God takes away their light and leaves them in darkness, where they are unable to see"
  2,18,"deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return [to the path]"
  2,19,"Or, they are like a cloudburst in the sky that has darkness, thunder, and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears because of the lightning bolts, afraid of death. God surrounds those who deny [the truth]"
  2,20,"The lightning almost blinds them. Whenever it shines, they walk by its light. When it is dark, they stand still. If God had willed, he would have taken away their hearing and their sight. God has power over all things"
  2,21,"People, worship your Lord who created you and those before you, that you may be mindful of God"
  2,22,"He, who spread out the earth for you and built the sky. He sent rain from the sky, and through it, brought forth fruits as provision for you. So do not knowingly set up rivals for God"
  2,23,"And if you are in doubt concerning our revelation to our servant, bring a chapter like it, and call your witnesses other than God, if you are telling the truth"
  2,24,"If you do not do that-and you never will-beware of Hell, whose fuel is people and rocks. It was prepared for the unbelievers"
