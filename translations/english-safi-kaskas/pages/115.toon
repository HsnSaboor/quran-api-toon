quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,42,"They eagerly listen to lies and greedily profit from all that is evil. If they come to you [Prophet] for judgment, you can either judge between them or decline, for if you decline, they cannot harm you in any way. If you do judge, judge them fairly: God loves the just"
  5,43,"Why do they come to you for judgment, seeing that they have the Torah with God's Law? Even then they will turn away from your judgment. These are not true believers"
  5,44,"We revealed the Torah with guidance and enlightenment. The prophets, who had submitted themselves to God, as well as the rabbis and the scholars, all judged according to that part of God's Book they were entrusted to preserve and to which they were witnesses. So do not fear people. Only fear Me. Do not barter my verses for a small profit. Those who do not judge according to what God has revealed are unbelievers"
  5,45,"In the Torah we prescribed for them a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and a similar retribution for wounds. However, If anyone forgoes this out of charity, it will serve as atonement for them. Those who do not judge in accordance with what God has revealed are unjust"
