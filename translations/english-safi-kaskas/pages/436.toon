quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  35,12,"The two seas are not alike: one is fresh and sweet, suitable for drinking, and the other is salty and bitter. Yet from each you eat fresh meat and extract ornaments to wear. You see ships making their way through [each of them] so that you might seek His bounty and so perhaps you will be thankful"
  35,13,"He merges the night into the day and the day into the night, and has made the sun and the moon subservient [to His laws], each running [its course] for an appointed time. This is God, your Lord. Sovereignty belongs to Him, while those whom you invoke beside Him do not even control [as much as] the skin of a date seed"
  35,14,"If you invoke them, they do not hear you, and even if they could hear, they would not respond to you. On the Day of Resurrection, they will reject your having associated them with God, and no one can inform you [of the Truth] like the One who is All-Aware"
  35,15,"People, you are in need of God, while God is the Rich Beyond Need, the One the Praiseworthy"
  35,16,"If He wishes, He can do away with you and bring forth a new creation"
  35,17,"[which] for God is not difficult"
  35,18,"No bearer of burdens will bear the burdens of another and if a heavily laden soul calls [another] to [carry some of] its load, nothing of it will be carried, even if they were related. You can only warn those who stand in awe of their Lord even though He is beyond the reach of their perception, and those who perform prayer. Whoever purifies himself [does so] for the good of his soul. God is the [final] destination"
