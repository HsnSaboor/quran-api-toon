quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,The intercession of intercessors will not help them
  74,49,Why then are they turning away from this reminder
  74,50,as if they were panicked donkeys
  74,51,fleeing from a lion
  74,52,"Yet, every one of them wishes to be given scriptures unrolled before their very eyes"
  74,53,No! But they do not fear the Hereafter
  74,54,No! This is but a reminder
  74,55,and whoever wills may take it to heart
  74,56,"But they will not remember, unless God so wills. He is the Source of all righteousness, and the source of all forgiveness"
  75,1,I swear by the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,And I swear by the self-reproaching soul
  75,3,Does the human being think that We will not reassemble his bones
  75,4,Yes indeed. We are able even to reshape his fingertips
  75,5,Yet the human being wants to deny what lies ahead of him
  75,6,"He asks, \"When is this Day of Resurrection"
  75,7,When vision is dazzled
  75,8,the moon is eclipsed
  75,9,and the sun and the moon are joined together
  75,10,"on that Day, man will say, \"Where is the escape"
  75,11,No indeed! There is no refuge
  75,12,Your Lord is the final destination on that Day
  75,13,On that Day the Human being will be informed of all deeds he put forward for this day and everything that should have been left behind
  75,14,"Rather, the human being, will give evidence against himself"
  75,15,in spite of any excuses he presents
  75,16,"[Prophet], do not move your tongue attempting to rush your memorization of the Revelation"
  75,17,Its collection and recitation are up to us
  75,18,"So, when We recite it, follow its recitation"
  75,19,"it is then, up to Us, to make it all clear"
