quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,51,"Believers, do not take the Jews and Christians as allies. They are only allies with one another, and whoever allies himself with them becomes one of them. God does not guide such unjust people"
  5,52,"You [Prophet] will see those with perverse hearts rushing to them and saying, \"We are afraid that fortune may turn against us.\" God may bring about good fortune for the believers, or He may not. Then they will be overcome with remorse for the thoughts that they secretly harbored"
  5,53,"The believers will say to one another, \"Are these the same men who swore by God with their most solemn oath that they were with you? All they did was in vain, and they lost everything"
  5,54,"Believers, if you ever abandon your faith, God will replace you with people He loves and who love Him, people who are meek toward the believers, uncompromising to the unbelievers; people who strive hard in God's cause, and do not fear being blamed by anyone. Such is God's grace, which He grants to whomever He wills. God has boundless grace and knowledge"
  5,55,"Your true allies are God, His Messenger and the believers-- those who are constant in prayer, pay the prescribed purifying alms, and bow down in worship"
  5,56,All who ally themselves with God and His Messenger and the believers will be victorious
  5,57,"Believers, do not befriend people who mock your faith and make fun of it, whether they are people who were given the Book before you or who are unbelievers. Remain mindful of God if you are truly believers"
