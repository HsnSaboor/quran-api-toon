quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  18,84,"We gave him power and authority on earth, and We gave him a way to achieve anything"
  18,85,So he chose a way
  18,86,"until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it [as if] setting in a dark, muddy spring, and nearby he found some people. We said, \"O Zul-Qarnayn, either cause [them] to suffer or treat them with kindness"
  18,87,"He said, \"We will punish the unjust. Then he will return to his Lord, and He will punish him with unspeakable suffering"
  18,88,"But as for the one who believes and does righteousness, he will have the best of rewards. We shall require him to do only easy things"
  18,89,Then he followed a path
  18,90,until he came to the rising of the sun. He found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shade
  18,91,"And so it was, Our knowledge encompassed all that happened to him"
  18,92,Then he followed a path
  18,93,"until he reached a pass between two mountains, where he found a people who could hardly understand a word he was saying"
  18,94,"They said, \"O Zul-Qarnayn, Gog and Magog are corrupting this land. Can we pay you to erect a barrier between us and them"
  18,95,"He said, \"What my Lord has given me is better [than any compensation]. Just give me a strong helping hand and I will build a solid barrier between you and them"
  18,96,"Bring me chunks of iron.\" When he had filled in [the gap] between the two mountain-sides, he said, \"Blow!\" When he had made [the iron] as red hot as fire, he said, \"Bring me molten copper to pour over it"
  18,97,"So [Gog and Magog] were able neither to scale the barrier, nor were they able to pierce it"
