quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"Those who profit from usury will rise up on the Day of Resurrection like someone tormented by Satan's touch because they say, \"Selling is like usury, but God allowed selling and forbade usury.\" So whoever stops when receiving his Lord's good advice may keep what was previously his, and his matter is with God. Those who return to [usury] will eternally be in Hell"
  2,276,"God condemns usury, while He blesses and multiplies charitable transactions. God does not love any sinful person who denies the truth"
  2,277,"Those who believe and do righteous deeds and perform their prayers and give the purifying alms have their reward from their Lord, and they will not fear or grieve"
  2,278,"Believers, always be aware of God, and quit what remains of usury, if you are believers"
  2,279,"If you do not, then be warned of a war from God and his Messenger; and if you repent, you may have your original capital. Wrong not, and you will not be wronged"
  2,280,"However, if the borrower has financial difficulties, then defer payment until circumstances are better, and it would be for your own good, if you fully understood, to forgive the entire loan"
  2,281,"Beware of a day when you are returned to God and every soul will be paid in full for what it has earned, and none will be wronged"
