quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,32,"Those who had been arrogant will say to those who they deemed to be weak, \"Did we prevent you from following the right guidance after it had come to you? Rather, you rejected it"
  34,33,"Those who had been thought weak will say to those who had been arrogant, \"Rather, it was your scheming, night and day, ordering us to deny God and attribute equals to Him.\" But when they all see the punishment [that awaits them], they will be unable to express their remorse. We will put shackles around the necks of those who rejected the truth, and they will be repaid only for what they have done"
  34,34,"Never have We sent a warning into a town without those who were corrupted by wealth saying, \"We reject the message with which you have been sent"
  34,35,"They also say, \"We are wealthier and have more children [than you], and We will not be punished"
  34,36,"Say, [Prophet] \"My Lord gives abundant provisions to whom He wills, or [likewise] restricts [it], but most people do not know"
  34,37,"It is neither your wealth nor your children that will bring you nearer to Us , but rather [your choice] to believe and to do good deeds. For those there will be double reward for what they did, and they will be safe in the upper chambers [of Paradise]"
  34,38,"But as for those who rejected Our messages, trying to undermine them, they will be consigned to the punishment"
  34,39,"Say, \"My Lord gives abundantly to whomever of His worshipers He wills, or [likewise] restricts [it], but whatever you spend [in His cause], He will replace, for He is the Best of Providers"
