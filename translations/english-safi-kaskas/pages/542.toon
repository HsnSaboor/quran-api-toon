quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  58,1,"God has heard the words of the woman who argued with you concerning her husband, while complaining to God. God heard your conversation. God is All-Hearing, All-Seeing"
  58,2,"There are those of you who divorce their wives by equating them with their mothers, they are not their mothers. Their mothers are those who gave birth to them. What they said is wrong and a blatant lie. But God is All-Pardoning and All-Forgiving"
  58,3,"Those of you who divorce your wives by equating them with your mothers, then wish to go back on what you said, must set free a slave before they touch one another. This is what you are instructed to do, and God is well aware of what you do"
  58,4,"But he who does not find the means, must fast for two months consecutively before touching one another. And if he is unable, then he should feed sixty needy people. This is to affirm your faith in God and His Messenger. These are the limits set by God. And the unbelievers will have a painful punishment"
  58,5,"Those who oppose God and His Messenger will be restrained, like those before them. We have sent down self-evident messages. The unbelievers will have a painful punishment"
  58,6,"on the Day when God will resurrect them all, and tells them what they did. God has kept accounts of it all, while they have forgotten it; God is Witness over all things"
