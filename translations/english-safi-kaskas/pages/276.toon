quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,80,"And God made your homes places to rest and enabled you to make dwellings from cattle hides-light, and easy to carry, whether you travel or camp, and [has supplied you with] furnishings and goods from the animals' rough and soft wool and its hair [to use] for a time"
  16,81,"And, from what He has created, God has provided you with protection; [He has given you] shade [from the sun], places of refuge in the mountains, and gave you garments to protect you from the heat, as well as garments to protect you from your brutality towards each other. In this way He perfects His blessings on you, so that you will surrender yourselves to Him"
  16,82,"But if you they turn away [Prophet], remember that your only responsibility is to deliver this revelation clearly"
  16,83,"They [who turn away] are fully aware of God's grace, but they nevertheless refuse to recognize it because they are used to denying the truth"
  16,84,"The Day [of Judgment] will come when We will raise up a witness from every nation. On that day, the unbelievers will not be able to make excuses or to make amends"
  16,85,"And when those who were unjust see the suffering that awaits them, they will recognize that the severity of their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be given any relief"
  16,86,"And when those who associated other beings with God see those they associated, they will say, \"Our Lord these are our associates whom we used to call upon apart from You.\" But they will throw their words back at them: \"You are liars"
  16,87,"and on that day they will freely submit to God, and all their idols will forsake them"
