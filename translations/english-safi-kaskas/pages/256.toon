  14,6,"Moses said to his people, \"Remember the grace which God gave you when He saved you from Pharaoh's people who afflicted you with cruel suffering, and slaughtered your sons, and spared [only] your women, which was a severe test from your Lord"
  14,7,"[Remember the time] when your Lord promised, \"If you are grateful, I will certainly give you more and more, but if you are ungrateful, My punishment will definitely be severe"
  14,8,"Moses added, \"[Even] if you, and whoever else lives on earth, [ever] deny the truth, God is rich beyond need, worthy of all praise"
  14,9,"Have you not heard of the stories of those who lived before you, the people of Noah, and of [the tribes of] Aad and Thamud, and of those who came after them, known only to God? A messenger came to them with all the evidence of the truth, but they covered their mouths with their hands and said, \"We refuse to believe in the message with which you [claim to] have been entrusted, and we deeply suspect [the substance of] your call to us"
  14,10,"Their messengers answered, \"Can there be any doubt about God, the Originator of the heavens and the earth? It is He who calls you, so that He may forgive you some of your sins and lets you enjoy your life until the appointed time.\" They said, \"You are only mortal men like us. You want to turn us away from what our forefathers worshipped, well, then, bring us clear proof [that you are God's Messengers]"
