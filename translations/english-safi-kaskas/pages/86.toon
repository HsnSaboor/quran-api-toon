quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,45,God knows your enemies best. No one can befriend and protect you as God does
  4,46,"Among those of the Jewish faith, some distort the meaning of the [revealed] words, taking them out of their context and saying, \"We have heard, but we disobey,\" and, \"Listen,\" [adding the insult] 'May you not hear,' - thus speaking abusively and implying that the [true] Faith is false. If they had said, \"We have heard, and we obey,\" and \"Hear us, and have patience with us,\" it would have been better and more appropriate for them. God has rejected them because of their refusal to acknowledge the truth. They have little faith"
  4,47,"People of the Book, believe in what We have sent down to confirm what you already have before We wipe out [your sense of] direction, turning you back, or rejecting you, as We rejected those who broke the Sabbath. God's will is always done"
  4,48,"God does not forgive the attribution of partners to Him, although He forgives any lesser sin unto whomever He wills. He who attributes a partner to God has invented a terrible sin"
  4,49,"[Prophet], have you considered those who claim purity for themselves? No! God purifies whomever He wills. No one will be wronged by as much as a hair's breadth"
  4,50,See how they invent lies about God. This in itself is an obvious sin
  4,51,"Do you not see how those given a portion of the Book, now believe in idols and the powers of evil and maintain that those who are bent on denying the truth are more surely guided than those who are believers"
