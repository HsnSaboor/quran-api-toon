quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  13,35,"The likeness of Paradise, which the righteous have been promised: rivers flow through it, [and its] fruit and shade are everlasting. Such is the reward for the righteous, and the reward for the unbelievers is the Fire"
  13,36,"Those to whom We gave the Book rejoice at what has been sent down to you, but some of the opposing factions deny part of it. Say, \"I have been commanded to worship God alone and not to associate anything with Him. To Him I invite others, and to Him I shall return"
  13,37,"And thus We have revealed it as an Arabic code of law. And if you should follow [your people's] whims and desires after knowledge has come to you, you would not have any ally or any protector from God"
  13,38,"We have already sent messengers before you and assigned to them wives and descendants. No messenger came with a sign except by permission of God. For every time period there has been a [suitable] revelation"
  13,39,"God eliminates or confirms [His earlier revelations] [as] He wills, and with Him is the source of all revelation"
  13,40,"And whether We show you part of what We promise them [those who reject God] or cause you to die [before that time], your only responsibility is to deliver the message. Ours is [to deliver] the reckoning"
  13,41,"Have they not seen how We deal with the earth, eroding it at its extremities? God decides; no one can modify His decision. He is swift in calling to account"
  13,42,"And those [who lived] before them [your people who reject God] schemed [against God's Messengers], but the ultimate scheme belongs to God. He knows what every soul earns, and the unbelievers will soon know to whom the future belongs"
