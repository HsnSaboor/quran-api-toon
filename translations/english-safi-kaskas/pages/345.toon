quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,43,No community can speed up or hold back its appointed destiny
  23,44,"Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Whenever a messenger came to a community he was invariably rejected, so We destroyed them one after the other, until they became mere tales. Away, then, with the people who do not believe"
  23,45,Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and a clear authority
  23,46,"to Pharaoh and his inner circle, but they were an arrogant, haughty people"
  23,47,"They said, \"Should we believe two human beings like us while their people are serving us"
  23,48,"So they called them both liars, and were consequently destroyed"
  23,49,And We gave Moses the Book so that they might be guided
  23,50,"And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and sheltered them within a hill where there was a meadow and a flowing spring"
  23,51,"[God said], \"O Messengers, eat good things and do good. I know all that you do"
  23,52,"This community of yours is one community, and I am your Lord, so be ever conscious of Me"
  23,53,"Yet [your followers] tore their unity piece by piece, each faction rejoicing in what it has"
  23,54,"So, leave them in their confusion for a while"
  23,55,Do they think that We provide them wealth and children
  23,56,"because We rush to give them good things? No, but they are oblivious [to what is going on]"
  23,57,Those who stand in awe of their Lord
  23,58,who believe in the messages of their Lord
  23,59,who do not associate anything with their Lord
