  6,69,"Those who are mindful of God are not accountable for the wrongdoers. However, this is a reminder to them so that they may become mindful of God"
  6,70,"Leave behind those who turn their religion into amusement and a diversion and are mesmerized by the life of this world. Remind them with it, lest a soul be damned for what it has earned. It will have no one to protect it from God, and no one to intercede besides Him. Whatever ransom he may offer will not be accepted. Such people will be held accountable for their actions. For them will be a drink of boiling water, and painful punishment awaits them because of their persistence in denying the truth"
  6,71,"Say, \"Instead of God, will we call on something that can neither benefit nor harm us, and turn back after God has guided us. [This would be] like someone seduced, having been tempted by Satan's earthly lusts, though his companions are calling him to guidance [saying], 'Come to us!'\" Say, \"God's guidance is the only guidance, and we are commanded to surrender ourselves to the Lord of the Worlds"
  6,72,and to keep up prayers and be mindful of Him. It is to Him that you all will be gathered
  6,73,"It is He Who has created the heavens and the earth in Truth, and whenever He says, \"Be!\" it will be. His word is the Truth. All control on the Day the Trumpet is blown belongs to Him. He knows all that is beyond human's perception, as well as all that can be witnessed by human senses, for He alone is The-Wise, All-Aware"
