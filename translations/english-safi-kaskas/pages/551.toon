quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  60,12,"Prophet, when believing women come to you, pledging that they will not associate anything with God, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor will they kill their children, nor lie about who has fathered their children, nor disobey you in what is right, then accept their pledge of allegiance and ask God's forgiveness for them. God is Forgiving and Merciful-to-all"
  60,13,"Believers do not take as allies those with whom God is angry. They have despaired of the Hereafter, as unbelievers despair of those buried in their graves"
  61,1,"Everything in the heavens and the earth declare the praises of God's limitless glory. He is the Almighty, the Wise"
  61,2,"Believers, why do you say what you do not do"
  61,3,it is most despicable in God's sight that you say what you do not do
  61,4,"God loves those who fight in solid lines for His cause, as though they were a well-built structure"
  61,5,"And mention when Moses said to his people, \"My people, why do you hurt me when you know that I am God's Messenger to you?\" And when they turned away, God caused their hearts to turn away. God does not guide the defiantly disobedient people"
