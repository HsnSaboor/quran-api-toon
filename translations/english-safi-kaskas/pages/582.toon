quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,What are they wondering about
  78,2,About the huge announcement
  78,3,over which they are in disagreement
  78,4,They will know
  78,5,For sure they will know
  78,6,Have We not made the earth a cradle
  78,7,And the mountains as pegs
  78,8,And We created you in pairs
  78,9,And made your sleep to rest
  78,10,And made the night a cover
  78,11,And made the day for livelihood
  78,12,"And constructed above you seven strong [heavens]"
  78,13,"And made [the sun] a glowing lamp"
  78,14,And sent down from the clouds pouring water
  78,15,"to produce with it grain, vegetation"
  78,16,and luxuriant gardens
  78,17,The Day of Decision has been appointed
  78,18,The Day the Horn is blown and you will come forth in droves
  78,19,And the heavens are opened and becomes gateways
  78,20,And the mountains are set in motion and will become a mirage
  78,21,Hell has been lying in wait
  78,22,to be a home for the oppressors
  78,23,"to stay in for a long, long time"
  78,24,They will not taste any coolness there or drink
  78,25,except for boiling water and sizzling pus
  78,26,An appropriate reward
  78,27,They were not expecting to be held accountable
  78,28,And utterly rejected Our verses
  78,29,We have recorded everything in writing
  78,30,"So feel it, We will only increase your punishment"
