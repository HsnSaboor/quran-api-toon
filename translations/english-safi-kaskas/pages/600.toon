quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,and the hearts' contents are retrieved
  100,11,"on that Day, their Lord is fully knowledgeable"
  101,1,The striking calamity
  101,2,What is the striking calamity
  101,3,And how would you know what is the striking calamity
  101,4,It is the Day when the human beings will be like dispersed moths
  101,5,and the mountains will be like fluffed up wool
  101,6,"and then, the one whose scales are heavy [with good deeds]"
  101,7,will have a pleasant life
  101,8,but the one whose scales are light
  101,9,his refuge will be an abyss
  101,10,And what will convey to you what that is
  101,11,a Raging Fire
  102,1,Your greed for more has distracted you
  102,2,until you go down to your graves
  102,3,"No, indeed you will soon know"
  102,4,Certainly you will soon know
  102,5,"Indeed, If you knew the knowledge of certainty"
  102,6,you would see Hell
  102,7,then you would surely see it with the eye of certainty
  102,8,And on that Day you will be asked about the pleasures you enjoyed
