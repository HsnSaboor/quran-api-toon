quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,"while seated on luxurious furnishings, looking around"
  83,36,Have the unbelievers been rewarded for their deeds
  84,1,When the sky is ruptured
  84,2,"obeying its Lord, as it is bound to do"
  84,3,When the earth is leveled out
  84,4,"and has cast out what is in it, and becomes empty"
  84,5,obeying its Lord as it is bound to do
  84,6,"O human being, you are laboring toward your Lord and you will meet Him"
  84,7,"Then, as for him who is given his record in his right hand"
  84,8,he will have an easy settlement
  84,9,and will return to his family delighted
  84,10,"But, as for him who is given his record behind his back"
  84,11,he will cry out for destruction
  84,12,and will rekindle the Blaze
  84,13,He used to be happy among his family
  84,14,"He thought he would never return [to His Lord]"
  84,15,Yes he will! His Lord was always watching him
  84,16,So I swear by the twilight glow
  84,17,and the night and all it gathers
  84,18,and the moon when it is full
  84,19,you will move onward from stage to stage
  84,20,So what is the matter with them that they do not believe
  84,21,"and when the Qur'an is recited to them, they do not bow down [to God]"
  84,22,But the unbelievers say it is lies
  84,23,but God knows best what they comprehend
  84,24,So give them the news of a painful punishment
  84,25,except for those who believe and do good deeds. They will have a never ending reward
