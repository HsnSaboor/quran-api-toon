quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,39,"This is part of the wisdom your Lord has revealed to you. So, do not equate any other deity with God, unless [you desire] to be thrown into Hell, self-condemned [by your actions] and rejected [by God]"
  17,40,"Has your Lord chosen you to have sons, while He takes daughters from among the angels? What a grave thing for you to say"
  17,41,"We have made things clear in this Qur'an, so [that] those [who deny the truth] might take it to heart, but it is only making them more distant from the truth"
  17,42,"Say, \"If there had been, as they say, other gods with Him, certainly they would have sought a way to the Lord of the Throne"
  17,43,"May He be exalted in His glory, far above what they say in greatness and sublimity"
  17,44,"The seven heavens and the earth, and everyone in them declare His glory. There is nothing which does not glorify Him with praise, but you humans fail to understand the manner of their glorification. He is All-Forbearing, Most-Forgiving"
  17,45,"And so it is [that] whenever you recite the Qur'an, We place an invisible veil between you and those who do not believe in the life Hereafter"
  17,46,"for We have veiled their hearts to prevent them from understanding the meaning, and We have made their ears deaf. So, whenever you mention your Lord alone while you are reciting the Qur'an, they turn away in disdain"
  17,47,"We know best why they listen when they listen to you, for when they are in private these unjust people say [to one another]: \"You follow only a man bewitched"
  17,48,See how they refer to you? They have strayed and cannot find the way
  17,49,"And they say, \"After we are but bones and dust, can we be resurrected to a new creation"
