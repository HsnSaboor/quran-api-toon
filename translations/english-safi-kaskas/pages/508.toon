quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  47,12,"God will admit those who have believed and done good deeds to Gardens with rivers flowing through them. While those who disbelieved, who enjoyed themselves, and eat like cattle eat, the Fire will be their final dwelling"
  47,13,And how many towns We have destroyed who were greater in power than your town which drove you out? There was no helper for them
  47,14,"Is the one who has clear evidence from his Lord like someone whose evil deeds have been made to look attractive to him? So they follow their [own] whims and desires"
  47,15,"The example of the Paradise promised to those who are mindful of God is that of a place that has rivers of pure water, and rivers of milk forever fresh, and rivers of wine delightful to all who drink it, and rivers of strained honey. They will have in it all kinds of fruits and forgiveness from their Lord. Is this like those who will abide eternally in the Fire and are given to drink boiling water that will cut through their bowels"
  47,16,"Among them are those who listen to you, but when they leave you, they say to those given knowledge, \"What was that he just said?\" Those are the ones whose hearts God has sealed. They follow their own whims and desires"
  47,17,"While those who were [willing to be] guided, God increases them in guidance and causes them to grow in God-consciousness"
  47,18,"What are the unbelievers waiting for, other than the Hour to come upon them suddenly? Its Signs have already come. But what good will it be to remind them once the Hour has actually arrived"
  47,19,Know then that there is no god but God and ask forgiveness for your sins and for the believing men and women. God knows when you get up and when you lie down
