quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,None will burn in it except the most wicked
  92,16,who had rejected and turned away
  92,17,But the one who was most mindful of God will be spared
  92,18,who gives his wealth away to purify himself
  92,19,not as payment for received favors
  92,20,"but only seeking the pleasure of his Lord, the Most High"
  92,21,He will be well pleased
  93,1,By the morning light
  93,2,and the night as it settles
  93,3,"your Lord did not abandon you, nor is He displeased"
  93,4,The life to come is better for you than this first life
  93,5,"And your Lord is sure to give you [so much], and you will be satisfied"
  93,6,"Did He not find you orphaned, and shelter you"
  93,7,Did He not find you lost and guide you
  93,8,Did He not find you impoverished and enrich you
  93,9,So do not mistreat the orphan
  93,10,and do not snub the one who asks for help
  93,11,Instead proclaim the blessings of your Lord
  94,1,Did We not relieve the tightness in your chest
  94,2,and lift your burden
  94,3,that weighed heavily on your back
  94,4,and raised high your reputation
  94,5,"For truly, with hardship comes ease"
  94,6,"Indeed, with hardship comes ease"
  94,7,"So, when you are done, get ready for serious devotion"
  94,8,and focus all your attention on your Lord
