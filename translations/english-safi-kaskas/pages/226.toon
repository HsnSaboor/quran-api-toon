  11,38,"[Noah] began to build the Ark, and every time the notables of his people passed by him, they mocked him. He said, \"If you are mocking us now, we will come to mock you [and your ignorance] just as you are mocking us"
  11,39,"In time you will know who will receive a humiliating punishment, and on whom a lasting suffering will descend"
  11,40,"When Our judgment came, and waters gushed up, We said, \"Place on board this [Ark] a pair of each species, as well as your family-except those against whom the sentence has already been passed-and the Believers,\" though only a few [of Noah's people] shared his faith"
  11,41,"He said [to his followers], \"Board this Ark. In the name of God it will sail and anchor. My Lord is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace"
  11,42,"It sailed with them on waves that were like mountains. Noah cried out to his son, who stayed behind, \"Come aboard with us my son, and do not stay with the unbelievers"
