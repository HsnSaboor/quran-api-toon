quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,104,"When they are told, \"Accept what God has sent down and the Messenger,\" they answer, \"What we inherited from our forefathers is enough for us.\" Their forefathers knew nothing and were not guided"
  5,105,"Believers, you are responsible for your own souls; those who go astray cannot harm you if you are on the right path. All of you will return to God, and He will tell you what you used to do"
  5,106,"Believers, when death approaches you, let two just men from among you act as witnesses to the writing of your will. If death approaches you while you are travelling far from home, let two just men from among another people act as witnesses. Take hold of the two men after having prayed and, if you have any doubt in your mind, let each of them swear to God, \"We will not sell our word for any price, even if it were for the sake of a near relative. We will not hide God's testimony, or else We will be counted among the sinful"
  5,107,"If It is discovered that these two are guilty of this sin, then two of those whose rights have been usurped have a better right to bear witness. Let them swear to God, \"Our testimony is truer than the testimony of those two, and we have not committed perjury, because that would make us unjust"
  5,108,It will be more likely that people will offer the truth in their testimony because they will be afraid that others might refute their oaths. Remain mindful of God and listen. God does not guide those who are defiantly disobedient
