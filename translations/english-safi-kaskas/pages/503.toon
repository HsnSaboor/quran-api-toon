  46,8,"Or do they say, \"He has invented it?\" Say, \"If I have invented it, there is nothing at all you can do to protect me from God. He knows well what you are engaged in. He is sufficient Witness between me and you. He is the Most-Forgiving the Merciful-to-all"
  46,9,"Say, \"I am not different from the other messengers, and I do not know what will be done with me, or with you. I only follow what has been revealed to me. I only warn plainly"
  46,10,"Say, \"Have you considered: what if the Qur'an is really from God, and you are rejecting it? When a witness from the Children of Israel has already testified to its similarity [to earlier scripture] and believed in it, and yet you are too proud to do the same? God does not guide the unjust people"
  46,11,"The unbelievers say about the believers, \"If it were anything good, they would not have preceded us to it.\" And since they were not guided by it, they will say, \"This is an ancient lie"

  46,14,"Those are destined for Paradise, where they will dwell forever, a reward for what they used to do"
