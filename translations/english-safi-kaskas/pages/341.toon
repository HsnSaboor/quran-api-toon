  22,74,"They do not give God His due esteem. God is omnipotent, almighty"
  22,75,God chooses messengers from among the angels and people. God is All-Hearing and All- Seeing
  22,76,"He knows what lies before them and what is behind them, for all matters will go back to God"
  22,77,"Believers: bow, and prostrate, and worship your Lord and do good, so that you may succeed"
  22,78,"And strive for God as He deserves. He has chosen you and has not imposed hardships on you in religion- the faith of your father, Abraham.
