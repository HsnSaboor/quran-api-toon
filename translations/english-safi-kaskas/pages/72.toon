quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,166,"What happened to you on the day when the two groups met was according to God's will, in order to give believers a chance to prove their faith"
  3,167,"and to let the hypocrites be known. When they were told \"Come fight in God's path or at least defend yourselves.\" They said, \"If we had known how to fight, we would have followed you.\" They were closer on that day to unbelief than they were to faith. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts. God knows what they hide"
  3,168,"As for those who remained behind, and said of their brothers, \"If they obeyed us, they would not have been killed.\" Say, \"Prevent death from reaching you, if you are telling the truth"
  3,169,"Never think of those who are killed in God's path as dead, but alive and provided for with their Lord"
  3,170,"rejoicing in what God has bestowed upon them of His favor, and they receive good news about those who remained behind who have not yet joined them - that there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve"
  3,171,"They are rejoicing in God's blessings and favor from God, and that God does not allow the believers' rewards to be lost"
  3,172,"Those who responded to God and his Messenger after suffering defeat, who do good and are mindful of God, will have a great reward"
  3,173,"Those who were told by others, \"People have gathered [an army] to fight you so fear them.\" This instead increased their faith, and they said, \"It is sufficient for us to be on God's side. He is the best of protectors"
