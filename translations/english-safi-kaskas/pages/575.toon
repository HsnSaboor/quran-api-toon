quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Your Lord knows that you stay up praying nearly two-thirds of the night, or half of it, or one-third of it, along with a group of those with you. God justly evaluates the night and the day. He knows that you will not be able to sustain it, so He will not require it of you. Read from the Qur'an what you can. He knows that some of you may be ill; and others travelling through the land, seeking God's bounty; yet others will be fighting in God's cause. So read from it what is easy for you, and observe the prayers, and pay The purifying alms, and lend God a loan of goodness. Whatever good you advance for yourselves, you will find it with God, improved and increased for you. Ask God's forgiveness, for God is Forgiving and Merciful"

  74,8,When the Trumpet is blown
  74,9,that Day will be a difficult day
  74,10,not easy for the unbelievers
  74,11,Leave Me alone with the one I created
  74,12,to whom I gave great wealth
  74,13,sons around him
  74,14,and for whom I smoothed all things
  74,15,Then he desires that I should add more
  74,16,No! He was stubbornly hostile to Our revelation
  74,17,I will increasingly exhaust him
