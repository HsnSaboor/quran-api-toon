quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,But you love this brief life
  75,21,and disregard the Hereafter
  75,22,There are faces on that Day that will be bright
  75,23,looking toward their Lord
  75,24,"While other faces on that Day, will be gloomy with despair"
  75,25,realizing that a backbreaking blow has befallen them
  75,26,But when the last breath has reached the throat
  75,27,"and It is said, \"Who will heal him now"
  75,28,And he realizes that it is parting time
  75,29,when one leg is entwined with the other
  75,30,that Day the journey is to your Lord
  75,31,"He neither believed, nor prayed"
  75,32,but he denied and turned away
  75,33,"Then he went to his people, full of himself and false pride"
  75,34,Your demise is getting closer to you and closer
  75,35,yet closer and closer still
  75,36,"Does the human being think that he [was created] to be forgotten"
  75,37,Was he not the sperm of ejaculated semen that fertilized the ovum
  75,38,"Then he became a clot. And [God] created and proportioned"
  75,39,"and made of him the two sexes, the male and the female"
  75,40,"Is not that [Creator] able to bring the dead to life"
  76,1,Has there come upon the human being a span of time when he was nothing to be mentioned
  76,2,We created the human being from a fertilized ovum to test him; and We gave him hearing and sight
  76,3,"Then We guided him to the right path, whether he is grateful or not"
  76,4,"We have prepared chains, shackles and a Searing Fire for the unbelievers"
  76,5,But the righteous will drink from a cup whose mixture is Kafour
