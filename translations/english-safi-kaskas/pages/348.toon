quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,90,"In fact, We have sent them the Truth, but they lie"
  23,91,"God has not taken any son, nor has there ever been any other god but Him. [Had there been], then each god would have taken aside what it created, and sought to overcome the others. May God be exalted in His glory, far above what they ascribed to Him"
  23,92,"The Knower of all that is beyond human's perception, as well as all that can be witnessed by humans. May He be exalted above all whom they associate with Him"
  23,93,"Say, \"My Lord, if You are going to show me what you have promised them"
  23,94,"then, My Lord, do not place me among such unjust people"
  23,95,We are surely able to show you what We have promised them
  23,96,Overcome evil with good- We are well aware of what they are saying
  23,97,"And say, \"My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the incitements of the devils"
  23,98,"and I seek refuge in You, my Lord, so they may not come near me"
  23,99,"When death comes to one of them, he says, \"My Lord, send me back"
  23,100,"so that I may make amends for what I left undone.\" Never! This is but a word he is saying; for behind them there is a [dimensional) barrier until the Day when all will be resurrected"
  23,101,"So when the Horn is blown, no ties of kinship will bind them on that Day, nor will they ask about one another"
  23,102,"And those whose balance [of good deeds) is heavy, it is they who will be successful"
  23,103,"but those whose balance is light, those are the ones who have lost their souls and will remain in Hell forever"
  23,104,"The Fire will sear their faces, distorting them horribly and painfully"
