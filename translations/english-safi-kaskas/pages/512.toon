quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  48,10,"Those who pledge allegiance to you [Prophet], are actually pledging allegiance to God. God's hand is placed over theirs. Whoever breaks his pledge breaks it to his own detriment. And whoever fulfills his pledge with God, He will give him a great reward"
  48,11,"The Dessert-Arabs who stayed behind [when you went to battle] will say to you, \"We were preoccupied with our properties and our families, so ask forgiveness for us.\" They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say, \"If God intended harm for you or intended benefit, who can intervene for you? God is fully aware of what you do"
  48,12,"But you thought that the Messenger and the believers will never return to their families, ever, and this seemed fine to your hearts. You harbored evil thoughts, and were corrupt people"
  48,13,"For those who do not believe in God and His Messenger, We have prepared a blazing Fire"
  48,14,"To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And ever is God Ever Forgiving, the Mercy Giver"
  48,15,"As soon as you are about to depart on a war that promises gains, those who [previously] stayed behind will say, \"Allow us to go with you\". They wish to alter the Words of God. Say: \"You may not go with us: God has said so before.\" They will say, \"You envy us\". How little they understand"
