  11,82,"When Our judgment came about, We turned those [sinful towns] upside down and rained down on them stones of hard clay, layer after layer, [which were]"
  11,83,"designated by your Lord [to punish sinners]. [Such punishment] is never far from the unjust"
  11,84,"To [the people of] Midian [We sent] their brother Shu'ayb. He said, \"My people, worship God [alone]. You have no God other than Him. Do not give [false] measure or weight [in your dealings with people]. I see that you are prospering, but I fear for your suffering on a day that will encompass you [with doom]"
  11,85,"Hence, my people, [always] give full measure and weight, with equity, and do not deprive people of what is rightfully theirs, and do not act wickedly on earth by spreading corruption"
  11,86,"What rests with God is best for you, if you are believers. I am not your keeper"
  11,87,"They said, \"Shu'ayb, does your prayer really command you that we give up what our forefathers worshipped or to refrain from doing with our wealth whatever we please? You certainly sound like the perfect tolerant and right-minded man"
  11,88,"He answered, \"My people, what if I am acting on clear evidence from my Lord, and He Himself has given me good provision? I have no desire to differ from you concerning what I have forbidden you. I want no more than to set things right as much as I can. I cannot succeed without God's help. I have placed my trust in Him, and I always turn to Him"
