  24,26,"Wicked women are for wicked men, and wicked men are for wicked women. Good women are for good men, and good men are for good women. The good [men and women] are innocent of what has been said against them; they will have forgiveness and a generous provision"
  24,27,"Believers do not enter houses other than your own until you have asked permission to do so and greeted their residents. That is best for you, so that you will be reminded [of each other's rights]"
