quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,When his Lord called out to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa
  79,17,Go to Pharaoh. For he has transgressed
  79,18,"and ask him, \"Would you be willing to purify yourself"
  79,19,And I will guide you to your Lord so you would be in awe of Him
  79,20,And he showed him the greatest sign
  79,21,but Pharaoh rejected the offer and disobeyed
  79,22,Then he hastily turned away
  79,23,"and gathered [his people] and proclaimed"
  79,24,"I am your lord, the most high"
  79,25,"So God seized him with punishment, as an example, in the life to come as well as in this life"
  79,26,"In this, there is a warning for whomever would fear [God]"
  79,27,Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven that He built
  79,28,He raised it high and proportioned it
  79,29,He darkened its night and brought out its morning light
  79,30,After that He spread out the earth
  79,31,"From it, He produced its water and its pasture"
  79,32,And He set the mountains firmly in place
  79,33,for you and for your animals to enjoy
  79,34,But when the Great Calamity arrives
  79,35,a Day when the human being will remember what he has done
  79,36,and Hell will be there for all to see
  79,37,for him who transgressed
  79,38,and preferred the life of this world
  79,39,Hell will be his home
  79,40,But as for him who feared to stand one day in front of his Lord and therefore restrained himself from following his whims and desires
  79,41,then Heaven will be home
  79,42,"They ask you about the Hour, \"When will it take place"
  79,43,How can you possibly know that
  79,44,Its time is only known to your Lord
  79,45,You are only to warn those who dread it
  79,46,"On the Day they see it, it will seem as though they only stayed an evening or a morning"
