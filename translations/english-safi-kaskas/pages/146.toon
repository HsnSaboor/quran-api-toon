quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,138,"They also falsely claim, \"These cattle and fruits are sacred, and only those we allow may eat them.\" They also [declare that] certain cattle are exempt from labor, and there are some cattle over which they do not pronounce God's name, falsely attributing this to Him. He will repay them for all their lies"
  6,139,"They also say, \"What is in the womb of such and such cattle is reserved for our men and forbidden to our women, but if the offspring is stillborn, then they may have a share of it.\" [God] will punish them for all that they [falsely] attribute [to Him]: He is All-Wise, All- Knowing"
  6,140,"Those who kill their children out of ignorance and declare as forbidden what God has provided for them as sustenance, falsely ascribing [such prohibitions] to God, are lost. They have gone astray and have not found the right path"
  6,141,"He has brought gardens into existence, both the cultivated ones and those that grow wild, as well as the palm-tree, fields with diverse produce, the olives, and pomegranate: all similar to one another and yet so different. Eat from their fruit when it becomes ripe and give what is due on harvest day. Do not be wasteful; He does not love the wasteful"
  6,142,"He gave you livestock for work and for meat, so eat whatever God has provided you. Do not follow in Satan's footsteps: he is your sworn enemy"
