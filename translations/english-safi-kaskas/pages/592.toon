quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,But you prefer this worldly life
  87,17,whereas the Hereafter is better and more enduring
  87,18,All this is can be found in the earlier Scriptures
  87,19,the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Have you heard about the Overwhelming Event
  88,2,"Some faces, that Day, will be humbled"
  88,3,working hard and exhausted
  88,4,They will kindle an intensely hot Fire
  88,5,and will be given drinks from a boiling spring
  88,6,They will have no food except from a thorny plant
  88,7,that neither nourishes nor satisfies hunger
  88,8,"Other faces, that day, will be peaceful"
  88,9,Well pleased with their endeavor
  88,10,in an elevated Garden
  88,11,where they will hear no idle talk
  88,12,A flowing spring runs through it
  88,13,Raised couches are placed there
  88,14,cups put in place
  88,15,cushions lined up
  88,16,and carpets spread around
  88,17,Don't they look at how the camels are created
  88,18,at how the sky is raised
  88,19,at how the mountains are erected
  88,20,and at how the earth is spread out
  88,21,"So remind them, for you are but a reminder"
  88,22,You are not in control of them
  88,23,But whoever turns away and rejects the truth
  88,24,God will inflict him with the greatest punishment
  88,25,To Us is their return
  88,26,Then it is for Us to call them to account
