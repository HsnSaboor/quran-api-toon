quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,109,"Everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to God, and all things will return to Him"
  3,110,"You are the best community brought forth for the good of mankind, promoting what is right, forbidding what is wrong, and believing in God. If the People of the Book had believed, it would have been better for them. Some of them are believers, but most are defiantly disobedient"
  3,111,"They will not do you much harm, and if they fight you, they will flee and not be helped"
  3,112,"They are disgraced wherever they are, except for a lifeline from God and from people, and they brought God's anger upon themselves. They are branded with humiliation because they, in their transgression and disobedience, persisted in denying God's signs and wrongly killed the prophets"
  3,113,"They are not all alike. Among the People of the Book are upright people, reading God's verses all night as they bow down"
  3,114,"They believe in God and the Last Day, order what is obviously right, forbid what is obviously wrong, and they are quick to do good deeds. They are righteous"
  3,115,The good they do will not be forgotten. God knows those who are mindful of Him
