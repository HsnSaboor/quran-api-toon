quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  59,10,"Those who came after them, say, \"Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith, and leave no malice in our hearts toward those who believe. Our Lord, You are Most Compassionate, Merciful-to-all"
  59,11,"Have you noticed those who act hypocritically? They say to their brothers, the faithless among the people of the Book, \"If you are driven out, we will surely leave with you, and we will not obey anyone who wants to harm you; and should anyone fight you, we will certainly support you.\" But God bears witness that they are truly liars"
  59,12,"If they are driven out, they will not leave with them, and if they are fought, they will not support them. Even if they should support them, they will surely turn their backs and flee; then they will not be helped"
  59,13,"Indeed, you [believers] strike more terror in their hearts than their fear of God. That is because they are a people who do not understand"
  59,14,"Even united they will not fight you except within fortified strongholds, or from behind walls. There is much hostility between them. You think they are united, but their hearts are diverse. That is because they are a people without reason"
  59,15,Like those who went shortly before them. They experience the evil consequences of their decisions. A painful punishment awaits them
  59,16,"They are like Satan who says to a human being, \"Do not believe.\" But when he denies the truth, he says, \"I disown you; I fear God, the Lord of the worlds"
