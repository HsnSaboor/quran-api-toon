quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,He reflected and plotted
  74,19,"So, may he perish how he plotted"
  74,20,Then may he perish how he plotted
  74,21,Then he looked
  74,22,then he frowned and glared
  74,23,Then he turned back to his old arrogance
  74,24,"and said, \"This is nothing but magic handed down from the past"
  74,25,This is not but the word of a human being
  74,26,I will roast him into Saqar
  74,27,And how would you know what is Saqar
  74,28,"It neither leaves, nor spares"
  74,29,scorching the flesh
  74,30,There are nineteen in charge of it
  74,31,"We have appointed only angels to be wardens of the Fire, and caused their number to be a stumbling block for those who disbelieve; so that those given the Book may attain certainty; and those who believe may increase in faith; and those given the Book and the believers may not doubt; and those in whose hearts is sickness and the unbelievers may say, \"What did God ever mean by this example?\" In this way God lets go astray the one who wishes to go astray, and guides him who wishes to be guided. None knows your Lord's forces but Him. This is nothing but a reminder to all human beings"
  74,32,No! By the moon
  74,33,and the night when it departs
  74,34,and the morning as it brightens
  74,35,it is one of those great things
  74,36,as a warning to human beings
  74,37,to whomever among you wishes to advance or regress
  74,38,"Every soul, is held in pledge for its own deeds"
  74,39,Except for those on the right
  74,40,"in Gardens, inquiring"
  74,41,about those who forced others to reject Our messages
  74,42,What caused you to be in Saqar
  74,43,"They will say, \"We were not among those who prayed"
  74,44,nor did we feed the poor
  74,45,"And we used to indulge in vain discussions with those who indulged [in mocking the believers]"
  74,46,And we used to deny the Day of Judgment
  74,47,until the Certain End came upon us
