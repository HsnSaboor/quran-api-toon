quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"[Abraham] then enquired, \"What is your business, messengers"
  51,32,"They said, \" We have been sent to a dissenting people"
  51,33,to send down on them rocks of clay
  51,34,marked by your Lord for those who rejected His messages and have severed all relations with God
  51,35,So We brought out the believers that were in town
  51,36,But found only one household of people who submitted to God
  51,37,And We left in town a sign for those who fear the painful punishment
  51,38,"There is another sign in Moses, when We sent him to Pharaoh with clear authority"
  51,39,"But Pharaoh turned away with his supporters and said,\" A magician or a madman"
  51,40,So We seized him and his soldiers and threw them into the sea. Pharaoh was to blame
  51,41,"And a sign in Aad, when We unleashed against them the devastating wind"
  51,42,"It spared nothing it came upon, and left it like decayed ruins"
  51,43,"And a sign in Thamud, it was said to them, \"Enjoy yourselves for a while"
  51,44,"But they defied their Lord's command, so the thunderbolt struck them as they looked"
  51,45,"They were unable to rise, nor could they find help"
  51,46,And before that the people of Noah. They were wicked people
  51,47,"We built the universe with power, and We are steadily expanding it"
  51,48,"And the earth We spread it out, How well We smoothed it out"
  51,49,And of all things We created two mates; perhaps you will reflect
  51,50,So flee towards God. I am sent from Him with a clear warning for you
  51,51,And do not set up any other god with God. I come to you with a clear warning from Him
