quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,53,"We have made some of them a test for others, to make the unbelievers say, \"Is it these men that God has favored among us?\" Does God not know best who is grateful [to Him]"
  6,54,"When those who believe in Our messages come to you, say, \"Peace be upon you. Your Lord has willed upon Himself to be Merciful-to-all. If any of you sins out of ignorance and then repents and lives righteously, God is most forgiving, a purveyor of mercy"
  6,55,"We clearly spell out Our messages and [We do it] so that the path of those who force others to reject God's messages may be made clear"
  6,56,"Say, \"I am forbidden to worship those you call on instead of God.\" Say, \"I do not follow your vain desires, for if I did, I would stray from among those who have found the right path"
  6,57,"Say, \"Behold, I take my stand based on clear evidence from my Lord, but still you deny it. I don't have in my power what you want me to hasten: judgment rests with none but God. He will declare the Truth, since it is He who is the best judge between Truth and falsehood"
  6,58,"Say, \"If what you seek to rush were in my power, everything would have been decided between you and me, but God knows best who does wrong"
  6,59,"He holds the keys to the unknown. No one knows those keys but Him. He knows all that is on land and in the sea, and not a leaf falls without Him knowing about it. There is not a grain in the earth's deep darkness, or anything living or dead that is not written in a clear record"
