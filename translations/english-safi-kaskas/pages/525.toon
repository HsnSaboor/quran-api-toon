quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  52,32,Or is it their dreams compelling them to say this? Or are they people full of tyranny
  52,33,"Or do they say, \"He has simply made it up?\" Rather, they do not want to believe"
  52,34,"Then let them produce something like it, if they are truthful"
  52,35,Or were they created out of nothing? Or are they the creators
  52,36,"Or did they create the heavens and the earth? In truth, they are not certain of anything"
  52,37,Or do they possess your Lord's treasuries? Or do they have control over them
  52,38,"Or do they have a stairway [into the heaven] to climb and eavesdrop? Then let their eavesdropper produce clear proof"

  52,40,Or do you demand a wage from them that would burden them with debt
  52,41,"Or if they know the future, so they write [it] down"
  52,42,Or are they plotting against you? The plot will fall back on the unbelievers
