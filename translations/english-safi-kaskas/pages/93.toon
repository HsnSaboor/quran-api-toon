quran[3]{c,v,t}:
  4,92,"A believer should never kill another believer, but mistakes happen. If someone kills a believer by mistake, he must free one believing slave and pay compensation to the victim's relatives, unless they willingly forgo compensation. If the victim is a believer, but belonged to a community with which you are at war, then the compensation is only to free a believing slave; whereas, if the person killed belonged to a community with whom you have a treaty, then the compensation should be paid to his relatives in addition to freeing a believing slave. Anyone who does not have the means to do this must fast for two consecutive months. God ordains this atonement. God is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  4,93,"But whoever deliberately slays another believer, his punishment will be Hell. There, he will remain and God will condemn him, and will reject him, and will prepare horrible suffering for him"
  4,94,"So, believers, be careful when you fight in God's path, and use your discernment. Do not say to someone who offers you a greeting of peace, \"You are not a believer, aspiring for worldly goods. God has plenty of gains for you. You were once in the same position, but God has been gracious to you. Therefore, use your discernment. God is always aware of what you do"
