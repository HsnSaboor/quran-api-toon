quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,38,"God does not love those who spend their possessions on others only to be publicly praised, while they do not actually believe in God or the Last Day. Whoever has Satan as his companion has an evil companion"
  4,39,"What harm would it be to them to believe in God and the Last Day, and give charitably from what God has given to them? God knows them well"
  4,40,"God does not wrong anyone by so much as an atom's weight. If there is a good deed done, He will multiply it, and will bestow out of His grace a mighty reward"
  4,41,"What will the sinners do on Judgment Day when We bring forward witnesses from within every community, with you [Muhammad] as a witness against these people"
  4,42,Those who denied the truth and disobeyed the Prophet will wish that the earth would swallow them. They will not be able to conceal from God anything that has happened
  4,43,"Believers, do not attempt to pray while you are in a state of drunkenness, but wait until you know what you are saying; nor if you are in a state of major ritual impurity, until you have bathed, unless you are travelling and are unable to do so. If you are ill, are travelling, have relieved yourselves, or had intercourse, and cannot find any water, then find some pure dust and wipe your faces and your hands with it. God is always ready to pardon and forgive"
  4,44,"[Prophet], have you not considered how those who have been granted their portion of the Book barter it away for error? They wish you, too, would lose the right path"
