quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,23,"The two replied, \"Lord, We have sinned against ourselves and unless You forgive us and have mercy on us, we will definitely be lost"
  7,24,"God said, \"You get down to earth, as enemies to one another. You will live and have your home there for a while"
  7,25,"There you will live,\" He added, \"and there you will die, and from it you will be brought forth [on Resurrection Day]"
  7,26,"Children of Adam, We have sent down clothes to you to cover your nakedness and as a thing of beauty, but the garment of awareness of God is the best of all. These are blessings from God, so that you may remember"
  7,27,"Children of Adam, do not allow Satan to seduce you in the same way he caused your ancestors to be driven out of the Garden. He deprived them of their garment [of God-consciousness] in order to make them aware of their nakedness. He and his tribe watch you from where you cannot see them. We have made satanic forces allies to those who do not believe"
  7,28,"Whenever they commit a shameful deed, they say, \"We found our forefathers doing it,\" and, \"God has commanded us to do this.\" Say, \"God does not command disgraceful deeds. How could you attribute something to God about which you have no knowledge"
  7,29,"Say, \"My Lord has commanded righteousness.\" Face Him, and direct your worship straight to Him. Call on Him, devoting yourself only to Him. Just as He first created you, so you will return"
  7,30,"Some [of you] He graced with guidance, while, others are doomed to stray. They have taken devils for their masters instead of God, thinking all the while that they have found the right path"
