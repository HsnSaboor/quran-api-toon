quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,28,"But if you [must] turn away from the needy, while awaiting a blessing that you are hoping for from your Lord, at least speak kindly [to those in need]"
  17,29,"Do not be either tightfisted or extend yourself to the point that you cannot even provide for yourself, so that you sit there blamed and impoverished"
  17,30,"Your Lord blesses abundantly, or gives in limited portion unto whomever He wills and is able. He is fully mindful of the needs of his creatures-seeing them all"
  17,31,Do not kill your children out of fear of poverty. We will provide for them and you. Killing them is truly a great sin
  17,32,"And do not go anywhere near adultery, because it is a disgrace and immoral"
  17,33,"And do not kill the soul which God has forbidden-unless in the pursuit of justice. If anyone has been killed unjustly, We have given legal recourse to his heir [to claim justice]; but, even then, he should not be excessive in taking life. For he is helped [by God's law]"
  17,34,"And do not approach an orphan's property before he reaches maturity, except with the best possible way. And be true to all you have committed to do, for truly [on the Day of Judgment], you will have to answer for every promise that you have made"
  17,35,"And whenever you measure, use accurate measurements and weigh with a level balance; this will be better and would be fairer"
  17,36,"And do not pursue matters about which you do not know anything: your hearing, sight and heart- all will be accounted for [on the Day of Judgment]"
  17,37,"Do not walk arrogantly about the earth; because, truthfully, you cannot tear up the earth or make yourself as tall as mountains"
  17,38,All of this is evil and detested in your Lord's sight
