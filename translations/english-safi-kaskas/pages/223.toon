  11,13,"Or, they [may] say, \"He invented it.\" Say, \"Produce ten invented chapters of similar merit, and call in whoever you can besides God to help you, if what you say is true"
  11,14,"But if they [whom you called] do not respond to you, then know that [this Qur'an) has been revealed with God's knowledge and that there is no God but Him. Then will you submit to Him"
  11,15,"As for those who care only for the life of this world and its bounties, We will repay [them] fully for everything they did, and they will be given nothing less"
  11,16,"But, in the life to come, they will have nothing but the fire; their works will be fruitless, and their deeds futile"
  11,17,"Can they be compared to those who have clear evidence from their Lord, conveyed through [this] testimony from Him-as was the book previously revealed to Moses-to be a guide and mercy [to humanity]? Those [who understand] believe in it, whereas those parties that deny its truth are promised the fire. Have no doubt about [this revelation]; it is the Truth from your Lord, though most people do not believe so"
  11,18,"Who could be more unjust than he who attributes his own lie to God? [Such people] will be arraigned before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, \"They uttered lies about their Lord.\" God's rejection is what the unjust deserve"
  11,19,"[those] who turn others away from the path of God-trying to make it crooked-and refuse to acknowledge the truth of the life to come"
