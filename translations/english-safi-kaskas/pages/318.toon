  20,97,"[Moses] said, \"Get out of here. All that you can ask for in this life is not to be physically harmed. But you have an appointment [in the Hereafter] you will not fail to keep. Look at your 'god' to which you remained devoted. We will burn it up and we will scatter its dust into the sea"
  20,98,"[People] your true god is God; there is no god but Him. His knowledge encompasses all things"
