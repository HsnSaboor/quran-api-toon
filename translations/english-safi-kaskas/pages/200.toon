quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,80,"Praying or not praying for their forgiveness will make no difference. Even if you were to pray seventy times for their forgiveness, God will not forgive them because they reject God and His Messenger. God does not guide those who are defiantly disobedient people"
  9,81,"After God's Messenger had left, those who remained behind were glad, because they hated to strive in God's way with their possessions and their lives. They had even said, \"Do not go to war in this heat.\" Say, \"The fire of Hell is a lot hotter!\" If they could only understand"
  9,82,Let them laugh a little because they will weep a lot in return for what they have earned
  9,83,"So, [Prophet,] if God brings you face to face with them again, and they should ask you for permission to go to war with you, say, \"You will never come with me, nor will you fight an enemy with me. You were happy to stay at home the first time, so, stay at home now with those who remain behind"
  9,84,"Do not ever pray over any of them who died, and do not stand at their graves; they rejected God and His Messenger, and they died defiantly disobedient"
  9,85,"Do not let their worldly possessions and their children impress you. God wants to use such things to punish them in this world, and for their souls to depart in anguish while they are still denying the truth"
  9,86,"When a new revelation is given asking them to believe in God and to strive hard alongside His Messenger, even those of them with means ask your permission to stay, saying \"Allow us to stay with those who remain at home"
