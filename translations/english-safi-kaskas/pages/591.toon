quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the sky and the knocking star
  86,2,what do you know about the knocking star
  86,3,It is the piercing Star
  86,4,there is no soul without a protector over it
  86,5,So let the human being consider what he was created from
  86,6,He was created from ejected fluid
  86,7,emerging from the vicinity of the backbone and the ribs
  86,8,"Indeed, God is able to bring him [the human being] back to life"
  86,9,On a Day when secrets are disclosed
  86,10,a human being will have no power or anyone to help him
  86,11,By the sky and its cyclical system
  86,12,and the earth which cracks open
  86,13,"indeed, this is a decisive statement"
  86,14,not to be taken lightly
  86,15,They plot and scheme
  86,16,but I am planning too
  86,17,So bear with the unbelievers. Let them be for a while
  87,1,"Praise the limitless glory of your Lord's name, the Most High"
  87,2,Who created and proportioned
  87,3,"Who destined and [then] guided"
  87,4,He who brought out the green pasture
  87,5,and then made it black stubble
  87,6,"We will make you recite, and you will not forget"
  87,7,except what God wills. He knows what is open to one's perception and what is hidden
  87,8,And We will ease you toward the easy way
  87,9,"So, remind, if reminding helps"
  87,10,He who fears God will remember
  87,11,But the most wicked will ignore it
  87,12,He will kindle the greatest fire
  87,13,"where he will remain, neither dying nor living"
  87,14,Successful is he who purifies himself
  87,15,and remembers to call on his Lord and pray
