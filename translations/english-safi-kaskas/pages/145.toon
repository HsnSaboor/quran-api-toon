quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,132,Everyone will be judged according to their deeds. Your Lord is well aware of all they do
  6,133,"Your Lord alone is rich beyond need, limitless in His grace. If He wills, He may put an end to all of you and put others in your place, just as He produced you from the offspring of other people"
  6,134,What you are promised is bound to come and you cannot escape it
  6,135,"Say, \"My people, continue to do what you are doing, and so will I, and in time you will come to know to whom the future belongs.\" The unjust will never prosper"
  6,136,"They allocate to God a share of the fruits of the field and the cattle, saying, \"This belongs to God,\" they claim, \"and this is for our idols that, we are convinced, have a share in God's divinity.\" Their idols' share does not reach God, but God's share does reach their idols. How badly they judge"
  6,137,"In the same way, their belief in idols has seduced the pagans to kill their children, thus bringing them to ruin and confusing them in their faith. If God had so willed, they would not be doing all of this. So abandon them and all their lies"
