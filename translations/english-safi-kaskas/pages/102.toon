  4,153,"The People of the Book demand that you [Prophet] make a Book physically come down to them from heaven. They demanded even more than this from Moses when they said, \"Let us see God face to face,\" and were then struck by a thunderbolt of punishment for their presumption. Even after clear revelations had come down to them, they started worshipping the calf. We pardoned this and gave Moses clear authority"
  4,154,"to raise the mountain above them in witness of their solemn pledge. We said to them, \"Enter the gate humbly,\" and, \"Do not break the Sabbath law.\" We accepted from them a solemn pledge"
