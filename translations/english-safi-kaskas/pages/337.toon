  22,40,"[They are] those who have been driven from their homes unjustly, for saying only that \"Our Lord is God.\" And, if God did not intervene by using some people to drive out others, many monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, where God's name is much remembered, would have been destroyed. God is sure to help those who help His cause, for truly God is strong and mighty"
