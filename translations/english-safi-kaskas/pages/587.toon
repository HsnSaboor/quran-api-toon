quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When the heavens are torn apart
  82,2,when the planets are sprinkled
  82,3,when the oceans are exploded
  82,4,when the graves are scattered
  82,5,each soul will then know what it has sent on ahead and what it has left behind
  82,6,"People, what has lured you away from your Lord, the Most Generous"
  82,7,"He Who created you, formed you, and proportioned you"
  82,8,"In whatever shape He willed, He assembled you"
  82,9,Yet you still deny the Judgment
  82,10,When guardians are standing over you
  82,11,honorable recorders
  82,12,They know everything you do
  82,13,"Indeed, the truly good will be in bliss"
  82,14,while the wicked will be in Hell
  82,15,They will roast in it on the Day of Judgment
  82,16,and will never get away from it
  82,17,And how would you know what is the Day of Judgment
  82,18,"Truly, how would you know what is the Day of Judgment"
  82,19,It is the Day when no soul will be able to do anything for another soul; and the decision on that Day is God's alone
  83,1,How terrible it is to those who give short measures
  83,2,"who, when they take a measure from people, take in full"
  83,3,"But when they measure or weigh for others, they cheat"
  83,4,Don't such people realize that they will be resurrected
  83,5,for a grievous Day
  83,6,the Day when Humankind will stand before the Lord of the worlds
