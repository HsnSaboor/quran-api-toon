  36,42,And that We have created for them similar vessels in which to ride
  36,43,"If We wish, We could drown them, with no one to respond to their cry for help, nor would they be saved"
  36,44,"except through Our mercy, that they could be given a while to enjoy life"
  36,45,"But when they are told, \"Beware of what lies before you and what lies behind you; perhaps you will be shown mercy"
  36,46,they turn away from every sign that comes to them from their Lord
  36,47,"And when It is said to them, \"Give to others from what God has provided for you,\" the unbelievers say to those who believe, \"Should we feed one whom, if God had willed, He would have fed? You are clearly misguided"
  36,48,"They say, \"When will this promise come about, if you are truthful"
  36,49,All it takes is one blast that will seize them while they still arguing about it
  36,50,"They will not be able [to give] any testimony, nor will they return to their people"

  36,52,"They will say, \"How terrible for us! Who has raised us up from our resting-place?\" [They will be told], \"This is what the Merciful-to-all had promised, and the Messengers told the Truth"
  36,53,"It will be only one blast, and at once they are all brought before Us"
  36,54,"Today no soul will be wronged at all, and you will be repaid for what you did"
