quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  31,12,"We gave Luqman Wisdom, \"Be grateful to God. Whoever is grateful does so only for his own good, [whereas] whoever is ungrateful [should know that] God is rich beyond need and praiseworthy"
  31,13,"Luqman said to his son while instructing him, \"O my son, do not attribute any partners to God. Associating others with him is a great transgression"
  31,14,"And We have commanded the human being to care for his parents. His mother carried him in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years. Be grateful to Me and to your parents; all will return to Me"
  31,15,"But if they try to make you associate with Me other partners whom you don't know, do not obey them. Do, however, [continue to] keep them company in [this] world according to what is right, but follow the way of those who turn towards Me. Then you will all return to me, and I will make you understand all that you have done"
  31,16,"My son, if something weighs as little as a mustard seed and should be within a rock or [anywhere] in the heavens or in the earth, God will bring it forth. God is Most-Subtle, All-Aware"
  31,17,"My son, keep up prayer, order what is obviously right, forbid what is obviously wrong, and be patient [in the face of] all that happens to you. Surely, these acts require courage"
  31,18,"And do not turn your cheek [in contempt] away from people, and do not walk in arrogance, for God does not like any vain and boastful person"
  31,19,And be moderate in your pace and lower your voice; the most disagreeable sound is the braying of donkeys
