quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,54,"Even if each soul that had done wrong possessed everything on earth, it would surely offer it [that day] in ransom. They will show remorse when they see the punishment; they will be judged justly, and they will not be treated unfairly"
  10,55,"Everything that is in the heavens and on earth belongs to God. God's promise always comes true, but most of them do not know this"
  10,56,"He is the One who grants life and deals death, and you will all be returned to Him"
  10,57,"People, a lesson has now come to you from your Lord, and a cure for what is in your hearts, and guidance and grace to the believers"
  10,58,"Say, \"It is grace and mercy from God, so let them rejoice; it is better than all [the wealth] that they have accumulated"
  10,59,"Say, \"Have you considered the sustenance that God has sent down to you, some [of which] you have made unlawful and some lawful?\" Say, \"Has God given you permission [to do this], or are you inventing lies about God"
  10,60,"What would those people who invent lies about God think on the Day of Resurrection? God's grace is limitless towards people, but most of them are ungrateful"
  10,61,"Whatever you [Prophet] are doing, or whatever part of the Qur'an you may be reciting, and whatever you [people] are doing, We are watching you when you are doing it. Not an atom's weight escapes your Lord on earth or in heaven, nor is there anything even smaller or larger [that is not] recoded in a clear book"
