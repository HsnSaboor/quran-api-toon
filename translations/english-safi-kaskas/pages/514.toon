quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  48,24,"It is He who held their hands from you and your hands from them, in the Makah valley, after He gave you the upper hand over them. God is ever seeing of what you do"
  48,25,"It is they who denied the truth, and barred you from the Sacred House, and prevented the offering from reaching its destination. Were it not for some believing men and believing women, whom you did not know, you were about to hurt them, and become unknowingly guilty. Thus God admits into His mercy whomever He wills. Had the unbelievers been clearly distinguishable, We would have inflicted on them a painful punishment"
  48,26,"The unbelievers had filled their hearts with fury, the fury of ignorance. But God sent down His tranquility on His Messenger and the believers, and made binding on them the word of God consciousness, to which they were most entitled and most deserving. God is Knowing of all things"
  48,27,"God has fulfilled His Messenger's vision in Truth: \"You will enter the Sacred House, God willing, in safety, with your heads shaved or hair shortened, with no fear. He knew what you did not know, and has granted you besides this, a victory soon to come"
  48,28,"It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of Truth, to prevail over all religions. God suffices as a Witness"
