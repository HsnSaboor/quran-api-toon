  13,6,"They [the unbelievers] challenge you [Prophet], to hasten evil [in preference to] good, even though [they should know that] examples of punishments have [readily] occurred before. Your Lord is full of forgiveness for people in spite of their wrongdoing; nonetheless, your Lord is [also] severe in retribution"
  13,7,"And the unbelievers say, \"Why has a sign not been sent down to him from his Lord?\" You [Prophet] are there only to give warning, and for every people there has been a guide"

  13,12,"It is He Who shows you lightning, [causing] fear and hope, and [Who] generates the heavy clouds"
  13,13,"The thunder glorifies and praises Him-as do the angels-in awe of Him. He sends thunderbolts and with them strikes whom He wills. Yet, they stubbornly argue about God, while He alone has the power to do whatever He wills"
