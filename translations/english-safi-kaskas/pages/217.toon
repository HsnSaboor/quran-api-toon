quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,71,"Tell them the story of Noah, when he said to his people, \"My people, if my presence [among you] and my reminding you of God's messages has become too much for you to bear, then my trust is really placed in God. So, decide with your 'partner-gods' what you want to do, and do not be hesitant; do with me whatever you decide, and do not keep me waiting"
  10,72,"If you turn away, I have asked for nothing from you; my reward is from God, for I was commanded to be among those who have surrendered themselves to Him"
  10,73,"[Nevertheless,] they denied him, so We rescued him and all those with him in the ark and made them successors, while We drowned those who denied our messages. See what happened to those who were forewarned"
  10,74,"After him, We sent [other] messengers, each to his own people, who brought them evidence of the truth, but they were not going to believe anything they had already rejected. It is in this way that We seal the hearts of the transgressors"
  10,75,"Afterward, We sent Moses and Aaron with Our messages to Pharaoh and his inner circle, but they acted arrogantly because they had decided to severe all relations to God and to reject Him"
  10,76,"So, when the Truth came to them from Us, they said, \"This is nothing but clear sorcery"
  10,77,"Moses said, \"You are calling it sorcery when the Truth was being given to you? Sorcerers can never prosper"
  10,78,"They said, \"Have you come to turn us away from what we found our forefathers believing so that the two of you might become supreme in this land? We do not believe in the two of you"
