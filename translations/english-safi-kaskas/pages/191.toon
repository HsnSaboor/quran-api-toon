quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,27,"Then, after this, God in His mercy is free to forgive whomever He will. God is most forgiving and Merciful-to-all"
  9,28,"Believers: idolaters are impure. From this year on, do not let them come near the Sacred House. If you fear poverty, then God, if He wills, will enrich you out of His favor. God knows everything and is wise"
  9,29,"Fight those People of the Book who do not believe in God and the Last Day, those who do not forbid that which has been forbidden by God and His Messenger, and do not follow the religion of Truth, until they pay the exemption tax after having been subdued"
  9,30,"Some Jews say, \"Ezra is God's son,\" while some Christians say, \"The Messiah is God's son.\" This is what they say with their own mouths. They repeat the assertions made before by unbelievers. \"May God destroy them\". How perverted are their minds"
  9,31,"They have taken their rabbis and their monks, and even Christ, the son of Mary, for their lords instead of God, when they were commanded to worship only one God. There is no god but Him. May He be exalted in His glory above all the partners they may ascribe to Him"
