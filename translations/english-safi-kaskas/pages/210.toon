quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,15,"Whenever Our messages are clearly conveyed to them, those who do not believe that they are destined to meet Us will say, \"Bring us a different Qur'an, or change it.\" Say [Prophet], \"It is not up to me to change it of my own accord; I follow only what is revealed to me. I fear the punishment of that Monumental Day [of Judgment] if I were to disobey my Lord"
  10,16,"Say, \"If God had willed it, I would not have conveyed this [Book] to you, nor would He have brought it to your knowledge. I was among you for an entire lifetime before it came to me. Why cannot you think"
  10,17,Who could be more unjust than someone who makes up lies against God or denies His revelations? Those who force others to reject God's messages will never prosper
  10,18,"[nor will] they [who] worship things other than God-things that can neither harm nor benefit them-saying, \"These are our intercessors with God.\" Say, \"Do you [think that you could] inform God about something in the heavens or on earth that He does not know? May He be exalted in His glory, and far higher above all they associate with Him"
  10,19,"People were once a single community, but later they began to hold divergent views. Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord, their differences would already have been settled"
  10,20,"They ask, \"Why has his Lord never given him any miraculous sign?\" Say, \"The unknown belongs to God, so wait, and I will wait with you"
