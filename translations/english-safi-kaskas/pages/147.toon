quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  6,143,"There are eight animals, in [four] pairs: a pair of sheep and a pair of goats. Ask [them, Prophet], \"Has He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or that which is in the wombs of the two females? Tell me what you know in this respect"
  6,144,"And a pair of camels and a pair of cattle. Ask, \"Has He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or that which is in the wombs of the two females? Were you present when God gave you these commands?\" Who then is more wicked than a person who, in his ignorance, attributes his own invented lies to God, and thus misleads people? God does not guide such wicked people"
  6,145,"Say, \"In all that has been revealed to me, I do not find anything forbidden to eat, except for a dead animal, flowing blood, and pork- It is impure, or a sinful offering dedicated to idols. However, if one is driven by necessity and neither desire nor excess, your Lord is very forgiving and most Merciful-to-all"
  6,146,"We forbade the Jews all animals that have claws and We forbade them the fat of both cattle and sheep, except what is on their backs and in their intestines or what sticks to their bones: thus, We punish them for their injustice. We are true to Our word"
