  6,127,"They will have the Home of Peace with their Lord, and as a result of their deeds He will be their Protector"
  6,128,"On the Day when He will gather them together [and say], \"Company of jinn, you have seduced many humans.\" And their allies among the people will say, \"Our Lord, some of us made use of others, and we have [now] reached the appointed time that You have decreed for us.\" He will say, \"The Fire is your residence, and there you will remain eternally, unless God wills it otherwise. your Lord is All-Wise and All-Knowing"
