  10,8,will have the fire for their home in return for all they have deserved
  10,9,"As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, their Lord guides them because of their faith. Streams will flow at their feet in Gardens of pleasure"
  10,10,"There they will call out, \"Glory be to You, God,\" their greeting will be \"Peace,\" and the last part of their prayer will be, \"All praise is due to God, the Lord of the worlds"
  10,11,"Were God to rush punishment for people in the same way they rush toward what they consider good, their time would already be up. We will leave those who do not believe they are destined to meet Us to wander blindly in their arrogance"
  10,12,"When trouble afflicts man, he cries to Us, whether he is lying on his side, or sitting, or standing, but, as soon as We have freed him of his trouble, he carries on as though he had never called on Us to save him from his trouble. In this way the deeds of such overindulgent people seem right in their own eyes"
  10,13,"We destroyed earlier generations when they transgressed in spite of the evidence of truth brought to them by their messengers, whom they refused to believe. This is how we punish those who force others to reject God's messages"
