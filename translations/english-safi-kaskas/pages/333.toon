quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  22,6,That is because God is the Ultimate Truth and because He alone brings the dead to life and because He is competent over all things
  22,7,"And [that they may know] that the Hour is coming; no doubt about it, and that God will resurrect all those in the graves"
  22,8,Yet among men there is he who argues about God without knowledge or guidance or an enlightening Book
  22,9,"turning away [from the truth] in his arrogance to lead [people] astray from the path of God. For him there is only disgrace in the world, and We will make him taste the punishment of the burning fire on the Day of Resurrection"
  22,10,"[He will be told] \"This is for what you have done. God is never unfair to His servants"
  22,11,"And among people you would find one who worships God with shaky faith. If good befalls him, he is reassured by it; but if he is tested, he reverts to his old ways, [thereby] losing both [this] world and the next. That is a manifest loss"
  22,12,"Instead of God, he calls upon what can neither harm him nor benefit him. That is the ultimate misguidance"
  22,13,"He calls on one who is more likely to harm than to benefit [him]. How miserable are both the protector and the companion"
  22,14,But God will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to Gardens with rivers flowing through them. God does what He wills
  22,15,"Anyone who thinks that God will not help him [the Prophet] in this world and in the Hereafter, let him find a way to reach out to heaven, then try to make headway, and see if his scheme will eliminate what enrages him"
