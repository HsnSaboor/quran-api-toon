quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  22,47,"They challenge you [Prophet] to bring on their punishment [if you can]. But God will never fail to deliver His promise. A day with your Lord is like a thousand years as you count them"
  22,48,"And how many a community did I indulge while it was unjust? Then I seized it, and their [final] destination is up to Me"
  22,49,"Say [Prophet) , \"O People, I am sent only to deliver a clear warning to you"
  22,50,And those who have believed and done righteous deeds - for them is forgiveness and generous rewards
  22,51,"But those who oppose Our message, [seeking] in vain to cause it to fail-those are the companions of Hell"
  22,52,"Yet, whenever We sent a messenger or a prophet ahead of you, and he was hoping [that his warning will be headed], Satan would cast [doubt] on his hopes. But God destroys that what Satan insinuates, and God confirms His messages, for God is All-Knowing and All-Wise"
  22,53,He makes what Satan spews forth a temptation only to those whose hearts are sick or hardened-surely the unjust are profoundly opposed to the Truth
  22,54,"So that those who have been given knowledge may understand that it is the Truth from your Lord and believe in Him, while their hearts humbly submit to Him. God will guide the believers to a straight path"
  22,55,"but the unbelievers will continue to be in doubt about it until the Hour comes suddenly on them, or punishment strikes them on the Day of desolation"
