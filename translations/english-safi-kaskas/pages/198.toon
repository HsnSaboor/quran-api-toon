quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  9,69,"[Unbelievers] you are just like your predecessors. They were more powerful than you and had more wealth and children. They enjoyed their share of worldly pleasures, just as you have been enjoying yours. You are as indulgent as they were. It is those people whose works became worthless in this world and in the Hereafter, and it is they who are the losers"
  9,70,"Have they not heard the stories of those who came before them? Noah's people, Ad's and Thamud's, Abraham's people, Midian's inhabitants, and the people of the destroyed towns. Their messengers came to them with clear evidence of the truth, and so it was not God Who was unfair to them, but they were unfair to themselves"
  9,71,"The believers, both men and women, support each other; they order what is obviously right and forbid what is obviously wrong, and they perform prayers, pay the prescribed purifying alms, and obey God and His Messenger. God will have mercy on them. He is Almighty and All-Wise"
  9,72,"God has promised the believers, men and women, Gardens with flowing rivers and nice homes in Gardens of Eden. But the greatest pleasure is God's continuous approval of them. That is the ultimate victory"
