quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  43,11,It is He who sends down rain from the sky in measured portions; We resurrect with it a dead town back to life. Similarly you will be brought forth
  43,12,"It is He who created the pairs, all of them, and has made it possible for you to ride ships and animals"
  43,13,"That you may settle on their backs and remember your Lord's blessings when you have settled and say. \"Exalted in His glory is He who subjected this to us. We on our own would not have been able to have it"
  43,14,We will surely return to our Lord
  43,15,Yet they attribute to Him only some of what He has created. Man is clearly ungrateful
  43,16,Or has He taken daughters for himself and favored you with sons
  43,17,"Yet when any of them is given the good news of what he himself attributes to the Merciful, his face darkens, and he suppresses grief"
  43,18,"what [am I to have a daughter], someone to be brought up in ornaments but cannot help in a fight"
  43,19,"Yet, they designated the angels, who are created to worship the Merciful, as females. Have they witnessed their creation? Their claim will be recorded, and they will be questioned about it"
  43,20,"They say, \"If the Merciful willed it, we would not have worshipped them.\" But they do not know that. They are merely guessing"
  43,21,"Or have We given them a Book prior to this one, to which they are adhering"
  43,22,"No they say, but \"We found our fathers following this path, and we are guided by their footsteps"
