quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,184,And fear the One Who created you as well as the earlier generations
  26,185,"They said, \"You are one of the crazed men"
  26,186,You are only a human being like us. We definitely think of you as a liar
  26,187,"Or else, if you are telling the truth, cause a part of the sky to fall upon us"
  26,188,"(The messenger, Shoaib) said, \"My Lord is Aware of what you are doing"
  26,189,"Thus, they rejected him. So, the punishment of the day of canopy (when dark clouds spread across like a canopy) grabbed them. It really was the punishment of a terrible day"
  26,190,"There is surely a sign in this, but most of them do not believe"
  26,191,And your Lord is surely the One Who is the most Powerful and the most Merciful
  26,192,This (Qur´an) is truly the revelation of the Lord of the universe
  26,193,The reliable and the loyal angel brought it (and revealed it)
  26,194,To your heart! So you may serve as a warner
  26,195,It is in a plain and pristine Arabic language
  26,196,"Indeed, that (very same message) exists in the scriptures of the earlier people"
  26,197,And is it not a sufficient sign for them that (some of) the scholars of the Israelites also recognize it
  26,198,Even if We had revealed this (Arabic Qur´an) upon a non-Arab
  26,199,"And even if that non-Arab was to recite it to them (in Arabic), they would still not believe"
  26,200,"Thus, We lance this (Qur´an) through the hearts of the criminals"
  26,201,"They will not believe, right until they see that painful punishment"
  26,202,Come upon them suddenly! They will not see it coming
  26,203,"Then they shall begin saying, \"May we have some respite"
  26,204,Are they urging for Our punishment to be hastened
  26,205,Have you given it a thought? (Even) if We let them enjoy (life) for years
  26,206,And then the promised punishment comes to them
