quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"When they listen to the revelations received by the messenger (Muhammad, SAW), you will see their eyes overflowing with tears. They recognize the truth and cry out, \"Our Lord, we believe! Include us among those who bear witness"
  5,84,Why should we not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us? We are indeed eager for our Lord to count us among the righteous people
  5,85,"Because of what they said, Allah would reward them with paradise, through which run the rivers. There, they will live forever! Such is the reward for the righteous"
  5,86,While those who reject and refuse to believe Our revelations shall be the people of the hellfire
  5,87,Oh you who believe! Do not deny yourself anything wholesome that Allah has made lawful for you. Do not exceed the limit. Indeed Allah does not like (the transgressors) _ those who trespass beyond the bounds
  5,88,"Partake of the lawful and wholesome sustenance Allah has granted you. Fear Allah, in Whom you (profess to) believe"
  5,89,"Allah will not hold you responsible for whatever is not meant or deliberate in your oaths. But He will take you to task for whatever you swear to and pledge in earnest. The penalty for that, (breaking your pledge), consists of either the feeding of ten poor people with the food you would give your own family on an average (day), or providing them with clothing; or the freeing of a slave. The one who cannot afford any of that, may observe fasts for three days. That is the atonement for breaching your sworn pledges. So observe and abide by your oaths. Thus, Allah makes His message manifest for you, so you would be grateful"
