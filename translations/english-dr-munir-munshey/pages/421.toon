quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,23,"Among the believers are men who have made good on their promise with Allah. Some of them have redeemed their pledges (and have been martyred), others await their turn. There has not been any change (in their determination) at all"
  33,24,"(Allah let it happen) so that Allah may reward the faithful for their sincerity and truthfulness; and so that He may either punish the hypocrites, or accept them back in His grace. Indeed, Allah is the oft-Forgiving and the most Merciful"
  33,25,"Allah drove the unbelievers back! In their fury they left without gaining any advantage. On behalf of the believers, Allah sufficed to do battle. Allah is absolutely the Strongest and the most Powerful"
  33,26,Allah brought the people of the scriptures _ those who were aiding and helping the enemy _ out of their forts. He struck terror in their hearts. That is how you killed some of them and captured others
  33,27,"Allah had you inhabit their lands, their houses and their riches, and the land that you had never trespassed or trampled. Allah is capable of accomplishing everything"
  33,28,"Oh prophet! Tell your wives, \"If you desire the life of this world and its decor, then say so. I will grant you your freedom and provide for you generously"
  33,29,"But if you choose Allah, His messenger and the house of the hereafter, then indeed (you should know that), Allah has prepared a great reward for the righteous amongst you"
  33,30,Oh wives of the prophet! The punishment will be doubled if anyone of you commits a lewd and vile deed. That is really easy for Allah to do
