quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,283,"If you happen to be traveling, and cannot find a scribe, then you may pledge (or pawn) goods in hand (for cash). If one of you trusts another (with any matter), then he who is trusted should (fulfill his pledge and) discharge the trust faithfully. He should fear Allah, his Lord, and not hide (any of) the evidence. Whoever hides evidence surely has a sinful heart. Allah has full knowledge of every single thing you do"
  2,284,"To Allah belongs everything in the heavens and on earth. Whether you reveal whatever is in your heart or keep it a secret, Allah will call you to account for it. He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. Allah is capable of doing every single thing"
  2,285,"The messenger believes in whatever is revealed to him by his Lord; so do the believers! They all believe in Allah, His angels, (all) His scriptures, and (all) His messengers. (They say), \"We do not differentiate between any of His messengers!\" And they say, \"We hear, and we obey. (We do seek) Your forgiveness, Our lord! And towards You is our journey´s end"
  2,286,"Allah does not burden any soul beyond its endurance. For it is what it earns, and against it is what it commits. \"Our Lord, do not condemn us for what we forget, or err. Our Lord, do not levy upon us the (kind of) burden You laid upon those before us. Our Lord, do not impose upon us a burden that is greater than our strength to withstand. Pardon us, grant us forgiveness, and have mercy on us. You are our Protector! Grant us victory over the nation of unbelievers"
