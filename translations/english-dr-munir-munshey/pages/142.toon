quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,111,"Even if We send angels towards them (as messengers), or cause the dead to speak to them (plainly), or present all the (unseen) things right before their eyes, they would still not believe _ unless (of course) Allah wills it so. Most of them act ignorantly"
  6,112,"We have set up Shaitans _ among the jinn and the human kind _ as enemies against every prophet. They inspire and provoke each other with their suave and specious speech. They could not have done that, had your Lord so willed. So leave them alone with the falsehood they cook up"
  6,113,"We let the heart of the unbelievers _those not believing in the life-to-come _ lean towards falsehood (and be titillated by it). Let them be contented with it, so they may amass all the evil deeds they please"
  6,114,"Ask them, \"Now, shall I seek someone other than Allah as a judge, even though it is He Who has revealed to you the detailed book (the Qur´an)?\" Those to whom We had previously given the book, know well that it is indeed revealed by your Lord. That it is the absolute truth! So do not be among the skeptics"
  6,115,The word of Allah is perfectly fair and accurate. None can dare change His decrees. He hears-all and knows all
  6,116,Most of the people of this world _ if you choose to follow them _ would lead you far away from the path of Allah. They merely pursue their presumptions; they just guess and speculate
  6,117,"Of course your Lord knows best those who have strayed from His path, and He knows quite well the rightly guided ones"
  6,118,"If you (really) believe in His revelations, you should eat the meat (of the animals) slaughtered in the name of Allah"
