quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  22,47,"They taunt you to bring on the punishment at once. Allah does not go back on His words. But as you count, a day for your Lord equals a thousand of your years"
  22,48,"To many a sinning towns, I granted (a respite and) an opportunity to redeem themselves. Finally, I nabbed them. Towards Me is their destination"
  22,49,"Say, \"Oh you people! The fact is, I am a candid warner for you"
  22,50,"Thus, there is forgiveness and a generous sustenance for those who believe and do righteous acts"
  22,51,While those who strive to undermine Our signs (verses) will be the companions of hell
  22,52,It happened to every messenger and prophet We ever sent. Whenever they desired (and received a verse) Shaitan put his own spin (interpretation) upon it. But Allah removes whatever Shaitan casts. And then He confirms and strengthens His verses. Allah is All-knowing and All-wise
  22,53,"(He does this) so that He may turn the work of Shaitan into a lure for those whose hearts are diseased and hardened. Surely, because of their malice and rancor, the evil doers (in their dissent) have strayed too far away (from the truth)"
  22,54,"(This happens) so that those with knowledge may recognize it to be the truth from your Lord, that they may believe it and that their hearts may acquire reverence for it. Allah certainly guides those who believe towards the straight path"
  22,55,"The unbelievers would keep on wrangling until the hour of judgment comes upon them suddenly, or the punishment creeps up on them on a day of disaster"
