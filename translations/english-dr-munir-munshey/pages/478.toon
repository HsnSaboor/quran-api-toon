quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  41,12,"Then He concluded the creation and organized (the smoke) into seven heavens in two periods of time, and revealed to each its duties and responsibilities. We adorned the heaven of this world with luminary bodies, and We secured them. This is the destiny appointed by the Mightiest and the most Knowledgeable"
  41,13,"But if they turn away then say, \"I (hereby) warn you about (an overwhelming punishment by) the lightning and thunder, the kind that struck down the people of ´Aads´ and ´Samood´"
  41,14,"The messengers came to them (and told them what lay) ahead of them as well as behind them, and instructed them to worship no one except Allah. But they said, \"Had our Lord wanted this, He would have sent us angels (to preach). We (hereby) reject that which (you claim) has been revealed to you"
  41,15,"Just like the people of ´Aads´! Without any reason or right, they conducted themselves arrogantly in this world. They said, \"Does anyone excel over us in strength and power?\" Could they not see that Allah Who created them, is certainly far superior to them in strength? They used to refute Our signs"
  41,16,"So, in a matter of a few ill-fated days, We devastated them with cold and frigid winds that shrieked past them. Thus, We made them taste a disgraceful punishment in the life of this world. And the punishment of the afterlife is worse, and far more humiliating. They will not be helped"
  41,17,"As for the ´Samood´, We showed them the way, but they preferred to remain blind about the guidance. Therefore, because of what they used to commit, a humiliating punishment of lightning bolts grabbed them"
  41,18,"But We saved those who believed, and used to ward off (evil)"
  41,19,"And (warn them of) the day when the enemies of Allah would be rounded up, (and forced on) towards the hellfire. They would be impelled (and shoved) onwards"
  41,20,"Before they reach the hellfire, their ears, their eyes and their skin would (begin to talk and) bear witness against them, regarding everything they used to do (in this world)"
