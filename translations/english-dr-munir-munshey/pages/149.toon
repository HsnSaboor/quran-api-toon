quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,152,"Do not touch the assets of an orphan till he comes of age, except with worthy and venerable intentions. (Be just), fill the measure to its full and weigh accurately. We do not burden anyone beyond his capacity to bear. Be just when you say anything _ (bear witness or pass judgment) _ even if it involves your own kin. Fulfil the pledges you make with Allah (or in His name). That, He has instructed you. Perhaps, you would bear in mind"
  6,153,"That, indeed, is My path _ the (only) straight path; so follow it! Do not follow other ways because they will alienate you from His path. That, He has instructed you! Perhaps you would adopt righteousness"
  6,154,"And We gave Musa the book. It was complete, and contained the detailed explanation of all things for the righteous. It was the guidance and mercy, so they may have faith in the (scheduled) meeting with their Lord"
  6,155,"We have (now) revealed this book, (the Qur´an) as a blessing. Follow it and fear Allah! Perhaps, you would be graced by His mercy"
  6,156,"(It has been revealed to you) lest you would say, \"The two groups _ (the Christians and the Jews) _ before our times had received the book while we remained ignorant and unaware of its study and knowledge"
  6,157,"So that you cannot (offer excuses and) say, \"Had the book been revealed to us, We would have followed its guidance better than the two earlier groups.\" The proof from your Lord has now come to you. It is the guidance and mercy! Can anyone be more evil than those who reject and shun Our revelations. Because of their aversion We will soon inflict a treacherous torment upon those who turned away from Our revelations"
