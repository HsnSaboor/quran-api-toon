quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  49,5,"Had they waited patiently till you came out to (see) them, it would have been better for them. Allah is the most Forgiving, and the most Merciful"
  49,6,"Oh those of you who believe, if someone wicked brings you a report, investigate (and ascertain the facts). Else, you might attack a people out of ignorance, and later get to regret your actions"
  49,7,"And beware! Amongst you is the messenger of Allah. You would certainly be in trouble, had he accepted your advice in most matters. But Allah has endeared faith to you, and He has beautified your heart with it. He aroused in you a disgust for disbelief, depravity and disobedience. Such are the ones following the right course of action"
  49,8,"An honor from Allah, a favor! Allah is all Knowing and the Wisest"
  49,9,"If peace breaks down between two groups of believers, and they begin to fight, (call a truce and) bring them to terms. If one of the groups is the transgressor, (all of you should) fight the group that is unjust, until it complies and returns to the commands of Allah. Once that happens, make peace between the groups fairly and equitably. Indeed Allah loves those who are just"
  49,10,"(All) the believers are brothers. Therefore, promote peace and conciliation between two brothers; and fear Allah. Perhaps you may receive mercy"
  49,11,"Oh you who believe! Let not one ethnic group ridicule another ethnic group. It may just be that those being mocked are actually better. Similarly, do not let (some) women deride other women, because the women being laughed at, may happen to be better. Do not defame or slander each other. Do not yell (racial, ethnic or other) slurs and epithets at each other. After entering faith, it is not right to insult others with disdainful names. Those who fail to repent and desist are really the evildoers"
