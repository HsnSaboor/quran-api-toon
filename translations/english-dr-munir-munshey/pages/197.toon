  9,62,"They invoke Allah and swear before you (the Muslims), in order to please you. However, Allah _ and so also His messenger _ has a greater right, so that if they are the (true) believers they should (try to) please Him"
  9,63,Do they not know that the fire of hell is for those who act contrary to (the commands of) Allah and His messenger? They shall stay there forever. That is the greatest disgrace
  9,64,"The hypocrites are afraid that a ´surah´ (of the Qur´an) might (soon) be revealed exposing whatever exists in their hearts. Say, \"Make fun (all you want). But Allah is going to reveal that which you dread"
  9,65,"If you were to ask them, they would surely say, \"We were just joking and having fun.\" Say, \"Are you having fun (and cutting jokes) about Allah, His verses and His messenger"
  9,66,"Make no excuses, now. You have denied the truth, after first having professed belief. We may pardon some of you, but We would certainly punish others amongst you because they are really guilty"
  9,67,"All hypocrites _ men as well as women _ resemble each other. They enjoin wickedness and forbid decency. They are tight-fisted (and do not spend for the cause of Allah). They forgot Allah, and so He forgot them. The hypocrites really are the evil doers"
  9,68,"Allah promises the fire of hell for the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women, as well as for the unbelievers. They shall stay in it forever. It serves them right! Allah has cursed them. For them, there exists a (constant) ever-lasting torment"
