quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,249,"When Talut set out (on a mission) with his army, he said, \"Allah is surely going to put you through a test by the river. Whoever drinks (and quenches his thirst with) the water from the river shall not be (a devotee of) mine. Truly, (a follower of) mine would be the one who avoids the taste of the water from the river, save a sip or two out of the hollow of his hand.\" But, except for a few, they all drank the water from the river. When Talut, and those who believed in him, crossed (the river), the others said, \"We do not have any strength left today against Goliath and his armies.\" Those who were certain about meeting their Lord, replied, \"How often has it been that a smaller group prevailed over a much larger group, by Allah´s leave?\" And Allah is certainly with the patient ones"
  2,250,"As they advanced to confront Goliath and his forces, they implored (Allah), \"Our Lord! Pour on us (a generous helping of) patience, plant our feet firmly and give us victory over the nation of unbelievers"
  2,251,"By Allah´s leave, they routed the unbelievers. Da´ood killed Goliath and Allah granted Da´ood the Kingdom and the wisdom, and taught him what He wished. This world would be full of (corruption and) chaos, had Allah not arranged to dislodge (and rid) one set of people by another. Allah is full of kindness and grace for the entire universe"
  2,252,"(Oh Muhammad, SAW), We recite to you the revelation of Allah with the absolute truth. Of course, you are the messenger sent (by Us)"
