quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,234,"The surviving widows of the deceased among you, must remain unmarried for a period of four months and ten days. After they complete their (prescribed) term (they are free to decide their future); you bear no sin for anything they do with themselves in an accepted manner.

Yet, you should make provisions for them (even then); the affluent in keeping with his means, and the poor according to what he can afford. A fair provision is an obligation upon the pious"
  2,237,"And if you divorce your wives before having (sexual) contact, but after settling (the amount of) the nuptial premium, then you are liable to pay half of the stipulated amount.

(For the groom) to forgo (his half) is closer to piety. But do not (forgo or) forget to show courtesy (and kindness) to one another. Indeed, Allah (vigilantly) watches everything you do"
