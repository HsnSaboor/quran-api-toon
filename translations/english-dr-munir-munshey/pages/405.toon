quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,6,"(It is) Allah´s promise! Allah does not go back on His words, but most people just do not know"
  30,7,"In the life of this world, they know only the manifest, the perceptible. They are heedless of the afterlife"
  30,8,"Do they not ponder about their own selves? Allah has created the heavens and the earth, and everything in between for a specific purpose and a predetermined period. But most people just fail to accept (the inevitability of) the meeting with their Lord (on the Day of Judgment)"
  30,9,"Have they not moved about in the land, so they could observe the fate of the people before them? They were stronger, tilled the land better and populated the earth much more than these present day unbelievers have. Their messengers brought them clear proofs! Allah was not going to oppress them, but they used to treat their own selves unjustly"
  30,10,"Then those doing evil fared an evil fate, because they rejected the signs of Allah and used to make fun of them"
  30,11,"Allah began the (process of) creation. And He will renew it! Then, you would be returned to Him"
  30,12,The criminals would despair and lose all hope on the day the hour (of Judgment) is established
  30,13,"They will not have the partners (they now ascribe to Allah) to plead on their behalf. (In fact), they will renounce those partners"
  30,14,"The day the hour (of Judgment) begins, is the day they will split into groups"
  30,15,"Those who believe and do good deeds will be settled in the garden of delight, and would be kept blissfully happy"
