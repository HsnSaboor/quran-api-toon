quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,109,"To Allah belongs everything in the heavens, and on earth. All matters are referred to Allah for decisions"
  3,110,"You are indeed the best of people ever brought forth for mankind. You enjoin (virtue and) the right (conduct), and you forbid the wrong (and the indecent). Had the people of the book believed, it would have been for their own good. Some among them are the believers, but most of them are evildoers"
  3,111,"Except for a petty (and passing) distress, they will never (be able to) harm you (substantially). If they fight against you, they will turn their backs to you (and flee). They will receive no help"
  3,112,"Disgrace is decreed for them, wherever they may be! Except in the name of Allah, or for the sake of humanity (they may find some relief). They invoked the wrath of Allah, so wretchedness is written as their destiny. This is because they rejected the revelations of Allah and killed the prophets without a just cause, and because they were rebellious and strayed (far) beyond the bounds"
  3,113,All of them are not alike. Some of the groups among the people of the book have stayed upright (and on the right path). They recite the verses of Allah in the small hours of the night and fall prostrate (before Him)
  3,114,"They believe in Allah and the Last Day. They enjoin (virtue and) the right (conduct), and forbid the wrong (and the indecent). They rush towards excellent deeds _ (the virtuous and charitable deeds). They are the righteous ones"
  3,115,Any good deed they perform will not go unrecognized (or unrewarded). Allah is very well aware of the pious ones
