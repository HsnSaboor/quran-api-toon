quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  39,32,"Could there be any one worse than the person who utters a lie about Allah and rejects the truth when it reaches him? For such an unbeliever, isn´t there an (appropriate) abode in the hellfire"
  39,33,While those who accept the truth and believe it with sincerity are indeed the righteous ones
  39,34,"With their Lord, they shall have whatever they desire. Such is the reward for the righteous"
  39,35,So that Allah may pardon their bad deeds; and so that He may grant them their compensation _ reward far in excess of what their good deeds deserve
  39,36,Isn´t Allah sufficient for His servants? The unbelievers try to daunt (and discourage) you with the fear of others instead of Him. There is no guide for the one whom Allah leads astray
  39,37,"(In the same manner), the one whom Allah guides cannot be thrown off track. Isn´t Allah the most Powerful _ the Lord of Retribution"
  39,38,"If you were to ask them, ´Who created the heavens and the earth?´, they will no doubt reply, ´Allah!´ Say, \"What do you think about those who pray to others besides Allah? Can they alleviate my distress, should Allah intend to inflict a distress upon me? Could they withhold His mercy, if Allah wanted to shower His mercy upon me?\" Say, \"Allah is enough for me! Those seeking (a trustee) should place their trust in Allah"
  39,39,"Say, \"Oh my people! Carry on with your practice, while I too will continue my way. Soon, you will come to know"
  39,40,"(You will find out) who deserves the disgraceful punishment, and upon whom lands the unshakable torment"
