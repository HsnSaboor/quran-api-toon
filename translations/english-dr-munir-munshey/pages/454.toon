  38,24,"(Da´ood) said, \"He certainly wronged you by asking for your lamb to join his herd (of ninety-nine lambs). Indeed, most friends and family members often treat each other unjustly, except those who believe and perform righteous deeds. Such ones (however) are few.\" And then Da´ood realized, that We had put him through a test (by this incident). So, he sought forgiveness of his Lord. He fell down prostrate and turned to Him in repentance"
