quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,16,"(The paradise is for) those who say, \"Our Lord, we really believe! Forgive our sins, and save us from the suffering of the fire (of hell)"
  3,17,"Such are the steadfast, the obedient _ those who spend (for His sake), and seek His forgiveness in the early hours of the morning"
  3,18,"Allah bears witness _ and so do the angels, and the men of learning _ that there is no god but He. In (perfect) balance does He maintain His creation! There is no god but He, the most Powerful and the Wisest"
  3,19,"Indeed, the (only true) religion according to Allah is Islam _ (submission to His will). Those who formerly received the scriptures sought to oppress one another, and (out of mutual jealousy) disputed each other. (They did so), after (true) knowledge had already come to them. Whoever rejects the signs of Allah, will find that Allah is indeed very swift in calling to accounts"
  3,20,"If they argue with you, say \"I and those who follow me, have surrendered our entire beings to Allah.\" Ask them both: those given the scriptures, as well as the illiterate pagans, \"Are you willing to submit (to Allah)?\" If they submit, then of course they are the rightly guided. If they turn away, then in fact (the responsibility) upon you is to convey (the message). Allah watches over His created servants"
  3,21,"Give the news of a torturous torment to those who rejected the revelations of Allah, killed the prophets against all right (and reason), and killed others who enjoined just dealings"
  3,22,"Such are the ones whose deeds have lost all their worth in this life, as well as in the life to come. They will have no helpers"
