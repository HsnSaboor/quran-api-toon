quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  47,30,"If We want We could have you recognize them by their very faces. But you may recognize them by their features, and by the way they talk. Indeed, Allah knows all your deeds"
  47,31,"Surely, We shall continue to test you, till We know the ones who struggle hard for Allah and remain steadfast; and We will test you in all your affairs"
  47,32,"The disbelievers __ those who obstructed people from coming to the path of Allah, and have caused distress to His messenger, even after clear guidance had arrived __ will not harm Allah a bit! Allah will make their deeds lose all value"
  47,33,"Oh those of you who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the messenger. Do not waste your good deeds"
  47,34,"Allah will never forgive those who continue to disbelieve, and obstruct people from the path of Allah, right until the time they die"
  47,35,"So, do not become lax. Continue to call towards Islam. You will be the winner! Allah will not diminish the worth of your deeds"
  47,36,"Life in this world is nothing but fun and games! If you believe, and be pious, He will grant you your just rewards. He will not ask for your wealth"
  47,37,"If He demands your wealth and continues to do so, you will be stingy and He will expose your weaknesses"
  47,38,"Here you are, now. You are being invited to spend in the path of Allah. Among you are those who are stingy; he who acts stingily does so for his own self! Allah is over and above all needs. You are the paupers! If you turn away, Allah will bring in your place others, who would not be like you"
