quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  18,46,"The wealth and children are mere adornments for the life of this world. In the eyes of Allah, the good deeds one leaves behind are better in terms of expectations and outcome"
  18,47,You will see the earth turned into an even field when We cause the mountains to become pulverized (into clouds of dust). We will gather all of them together. None shall be absent
  18,48,"They shall be made to line up before their Lord in rows. (Allah will say), \"Now! You have arrived before Us just as We created you the first time! And you thought We would not appoint a time (of reckoning) for you"
  18,49,"The book (of deeds) shall be placed. And you will find the criminals panicky, afraid of what it might contain. They will say, \"Oh, pity on us! What a book! Nothing is missing in it! Every single thing _ minor as well as major _ has been listed!\" They will find everything they ever did, described (in the book in detail). Your Lord will be unfair to no one"
  18,50,"When We ordered the Angels to prostrate themselves before Adam, they all did _ except Iblees (Shaitan). He is a jinn and he defied the command of your Lord. Yet, instead of Me (Allah) you accept him (Shaitan) and his descendants, as friends _ even though they are the enemies. Evil is the final end of the evil doers"
  18,51,"I did not let them witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor the creation of their own selves. I wouldn´t accept as aides those who lead men astray"
  18,52,"That day He will say, \"Go on! Scream and call (for help) all those you claimed were My partners\". And call they would, indeed! But they shall receive no response! We shall place a barrier between them"
  18,53,"The criminals (that day) will witness the hellfire, fearing that they will (inevitably) fall into it. They will find no way to escape"
