quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,And all the secrets buried in the hearts are divulged
  100,11,"That day, (they would learn that) their Lord is thoroughly Knowledgeable about their deeds"
  101,1,That awesome (stunning) disaster
  101,2,What is (that) awesome disaster
  101,3,What do you suppose is that awesome disaster
  101,4,"That day, people would be like scattered (confused) moths"
  101,5,And the mountains like the fluffy tufts of colored wool
  101,6,Anyone whose scales (of good deeds) weigh heavier
  101,7,Would live in a state of bliss
  101,8,As for the one whose scale (of good deeds) is lighter
  101,9,An abysmal pit would totally engulf him
  101,10,And what do you think is (the content of) the abysmal pit
  101,11,Hot blazing fire
  102,1,"(Oh men! Your obsession to attain, hoard and show off) opulence diverts you (and keeps you busy)"
  102,2,Right until you land in (your) graves
  102,3,"No, surely not! You shall soon find out"
  102,4,"Again, be sure! You shall soon find out"
  102,5,"No, of course not! If you only knew with certainty"
  102,6,You shall surely see hell
  102,7,"Then, you would really see it with the eye of certainty"
  102,8,"And then, you would certainly be called to account for the blessings and the bounties"
