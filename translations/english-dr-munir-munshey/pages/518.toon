quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  50,1,"Qaf, (Allah swears) by the Glorious Qur´an"
  50,2,"In fact, they are surprised because one of their own, (a mortal like themselves), came to them as a warner. The unbelievers said, \"That is really odd"
  50,3,"(Would we live again) after we die and become dust? Such a return (to life) is far-fetched, (a fantasy)"
  50,4,(Really)? We know very well everything that the earth consumes from their (dead decomposing) bodies. With Us is the book that (records and) preserves (every event)
  50,5,No! In fact they rejected the truth (about the hereafter) just as soon as it came to them. So now they are perturbed and perplexed
  50,6,(Isn´t life after death likely)? Did they not ever look at the sky above them? (Did they not wonder) how We made and adorned it? Lapses it does lack; it is free of flaws
  50,7,"And (what about) the earth? We laid out the earth, placed mountains firmly upon it, and caused all sorts of delightful plant life to proliferate on it"
  50,8,"These are the (clues), insights and reminders for every human being, anyone turning (to Allah) in repentance"
  50,9,"From the sky We sent down the water as (Our) blessing; and with it, We produced the gardens and the harvested grain"
  50,10,As also the tall date trees with their densely clustered dates
  50,11,"(Such is) the provision for My servants! With that water, We bring the dead land back to life. The emergence (of the dead back to life) shall happen in much the same manner"
  50,12,"Prior to them, ( the present day unbelievers), the nation of Nooh, the people of ´Russ´, and ´Samood´ had rejected (life-after-death)"
  50,13,"And ´Aads´, the pharaohs and the brethren of Loot"
  50,14,"The people of ´Aikah´, and the nation of ´Tubbah´. Each of them rejected the messengers. So (My) threat became a reality"
  50,15,"Were We not capable of bringing this creation into being the first time? Yet, they are uncertain about the new creation, ( the revival of creation)"
