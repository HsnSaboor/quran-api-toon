quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  66,1,"Oh prophet! Why did you, in order to please your wives, forbid yourself that which Allah has deemed lawful for you? Allah is all-Forgiving, the most Merciful"
  66,2,"Allah has prescribed a procedure for you to expiate (and rescind) such oaths. Allah is your Patron; He is the most Knowledgeable, the Wisest"
  66,3,"(Remember)! The prophet confided in one of his wives concerning a certain matter. When she divulged (the information) to another one (of his wives), Allah informed the prophet about it. The prophet told his wife a portion (of what Allah had informed him) and ignored the rest. When he told her about it, she asked, \"Who told you about this?\" He replied, \"The One Who knows all and is the most Aware has told me"
  66,4,"(Oh wives of the prophet), the two of you better turn to Allah and repent. Your hearts have wandered off the right path. But if you back each other against the prophet, then (beware)! Allah is certainly his friend! And so are the angel Gibraeel, and all the righteous believers. Besides that, all the angels are his supporters"
  66,5,"In case the prophet divorces you all, his Lord would perhaps grant him other wives _ widows or maidens, in your place. They would be better than you, more obedient, believing, pious, penitent and fond of fasting"
  66,6,"Oh you who believe, save yourselves and your families from the fire. Humans and stones are its fuel! Burly and rigidly fierce angels are (appointed as guards) over it. They do not disobey or disregard any of the commands of Allah. (Rather), they (diligently) carry out whatever they are commanded"
  66,7,Oh you unbelievers! Do not make excuses today. You are being punished only for what you have (actually) done (and nothing else)
