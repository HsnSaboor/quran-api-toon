quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,1,"Alif, Laam, Meem"
  3,2,"(He is) Allah! There is no god but He, the Ever living, the Eternal"
  3,3,He revealed to you the book with the truth; it confirms the scriptures that came before it. (It is) He (Who) revealed the Torah and the Gospels
  3,4,"In the past, as guidance for mankind! (Now) He has revealed the criterion (to discern the truth). For those who reject the signs of Allah, there exists the severest (most awful) torment. Allah is the most Powerful; (He is) the Lord of Revenge"
  3,5,"Indeed, (He is) Allah! Nothing at all on earth _ nor anything in the heavens _ is (ever) hidden from Him"
  3,6,"He it is, Who shapes you in (your mothers´) wombs any way He wills. There is no god but He, the most Powerful, the Wisest"
  3,7,"He it is, Who revealed to you the book. It contains verses that are (decisive and) crystal clear, _ those are the essence and substance of the book _ and others that are allegorical. Those with (malice and) doubt in their hearts, desire to create mischief and go after such allegorical verses. They seek to interpret them (to suit their own preconceived notions). No one knows their real meaning except Allah! Those with sound (well grounded) knowledge say, \"We believe in the entire Qur´an. All of it is from our Lord.\" Actually, those with insight heed the advice"
  3,8,"(They pray), \"Our Lord, do not let our hearts go astray, now that You have guided us aright. By Your grace, grant us mercy. Indeed, You are absolutely the very best of the Bestowers"
  3,9,"Our Lord, You will certainly gather all of mankind on the day (of Judgment), about which there is no doubt.\" Of course, Allah never fails to fulfill His promise"
