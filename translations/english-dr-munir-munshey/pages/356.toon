  24,44,"Allah alternates the night and the day. Surely, there is a lesson in this for those with insight"
  24,45,"Allah has created all creatures from water. Some creep on their bellies, some walk on two legs and some on all four. Allah creates what He wants! Indeed, Allah has power over everything"
  24,46,We have surely revealed the plain precise verses! Allah guides towards the straight path whom He wants
  24,47,"They (unbelievers) say, \"We believe in Allah and His Messenger and we obey.\" But after that, some of them turn away. Those are not the believers"
  24,48,When they are called towards Allah and His messenger _ so he may settle their differences _ some of them reject and turn away
  24,49,"(However) if the truth is in their favor, they feign obedience and accept (the decision)"
  24,50,"Is there a disease in their hearts? Or do they mistrust? Do they suspect that Allah and His messenger would treat them unfairly? Of course not! In fact, it is they who are unjust"
  24,51,"The believers, too, are called towards Allah and His messenger, so He may settle their differences. Their outlook (in sharp contrast) is that they say, \"We hear and we obey\". Such, indeed, are the successful ones"
  24,52,"Those who obey Allah and His messenger, fear Allah and do their duty, are indeed the triumphant ones"
  24,53,"They swear so very solemnly that they would definitely leave home (and go forth into battle) if you ordered them. Say, \"Do not swear! Obedience is what is required!\" Allah is well Aware of what you do"
