quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,(I swear that) this (Qur´an) is certainly a noble recital
  56,78,(Inscribed) in a well-guarded book
  56,79,"Only those who are (physically and ritually) clean, (are allowed to) touch it"
  56,80,(It is) a revelation from the Lord of the universe
  56,81,"Yet, do you shun this narrative (nonchalantly)"
  56,82,"Do you make the denial (of the truth) your livelihood, (and respond to the blessings by rejecting the truth)"
  56,83,How about when (the soul of the dying) heaves up into the throat
  56,84,"At that time, you can do nothing but look on (helplessly)"
  56,85,"Compared to you, We are closer to the one dying. But you cannot see"
  56,86,"Thus, if (you think) you are not subject to reckoning, why can´t you"
  56,87,"Return the soul back (to the dead), if you are (indeed) truthful"
  56,88,And if the dying person had been (the one) nearest (to Allah)
  56,89,"(He shall have) peace and tranquility, bounteous provisions and the blissful idyllic paradise"
  56,90,While if the (dying) person is among those of the right (side)
  56,91,"(He shall hear the greetings), \"Peace be to you. (You are) among those of the right (side)"
  56,92,But if the deceased happens to be among those who rejected and went astray
  56,93,(He shall have) the hot boiling water ´to welcome´ him
  56,94,And the roasting heat of the hellfire
  56,95,Indeed! That is definitely and most certainly the absolute truth
  56,96,"So, (oh prophet)! glorify and praise the name of the Greatest, your Supreme Lord"
  57,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and on earth, glorifies and praises Allah. He is the Mightiest, the Wisest"
  57,2,"The kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. He gives life and death, and He is capable of doing everything"
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last, the Perceptible and the Unseen. And He is well Aware of every single thing"
