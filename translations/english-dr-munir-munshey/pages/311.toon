quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Did you see the one who has chosen to deny Our signs and yet says, \"I shall definitely be granted wealth and children"
  19,78,Has he peeked into the unseen? or has he entered into a contract with Rehman
  19,79,"Indeed not! Rather, We are recording everything he says. We shall extend his punishment a great deal further"
  19,80,We shall repossess all that he owns. And We shall bring him out all alone
  19,81,"They have taken gods other than Allah, so that they may have supporters"
  19,82,"No! Indeed, their false gods will disown their worship, and they will become adversaries"
  19,83,"Do you not notice? We send the Shaitans upon the disbelievers, and they continually incite and instigate them"
  19,84,Do not be impatient with them. We are counting down their days
  19,85,"That day, We will gather the pious (God-fearing) as guests of Rehman"
  19,86,"While the sinners will be like thirst-stricken animals, whom We will shove towards the hellfire"
  19,87,"No one has the ability to intervene, except those whom Rehman has promised"
  19,88,What? Do they say Rehman (God) has a son
  19,89,They have surely brought forth a grave thing
  19,90,"So grave, indeed, that it may cause the earth to explode into pieces! Or the mountains may come tumbling down! Or the heavens might just crack asunder"
  19,91,They have dared to assign a son for Rehman
  19,92,It is not befitting for Rehman to have a son
  19,93,Every being in the heavens and on the earth shall come before Rehman as a slave
  19,94,"He is aware of their exact number, and He has counted them all up"
  19,95,"On the Day of Judgment, each of them shall arrive all alone, and shall be on his own"
