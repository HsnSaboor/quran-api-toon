quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,36,"In fact, only those who care to listen attentively can respond (to the call). As for the dead, Allah will bring them to life, and then they would be presented before Him (for reckoning)"
  6,37,"They ask, \"Why was a sign from his Lord not sent along with him.\" Say, \"Of course, Allah has the power to bestow such a sign.\" But most of them have no knowledge"
  6,38,"(A sign for you): all the animals and creatures moving on earth as well as all the birds flying in the air on their wings, exist as distinct species and families just like your own. We have not neglected to include anything in the book (of decrees). Finally, all of them would be gathered before their Lord"

  6,40,"Say, \"What do you think? If you are truthful (answer this)! If Allah´s torment (in this world) or the hour (of Judgment) lands on you, would you implore and beseech any other being besides Allah"
  6,41,"In fact, you would call Him and none else! And if He wills, He will answer your prayer and relieve you (of your problem). At that time, you will forget the partners you now associate with Him"

  6,43,"Why did they fail to (believe and) adopt humility when Our punishment struck them? On the contrary, their hearts grew (cold and) hard. Shaitan adorned and let their deeds seem adorable to them"
  6,44,"Once they (completely ignored and) forgot what they were asked to remember, We flung open for them the gates of everything pleasant and prosperous. They were well pleased and contented with everything they were granted. Then We seized them unawares, and they sank into a state of (deep depression and) helplessness"
