quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,The true believers are the ones really successful
  23,2,Those who pray with humility
  23,3,And shun vulgarity
  23,4,And discharge their obligation of ´zakat´
  23,5,Those who (guard their chastity and) rein in their sexual urges
  23,6,"Except with their wives and those their right hands possess. For that, they deserve no blame"
  23,7,"But, whoever lusts after anything beyond that is a transgressor"
  23,8,(And those) who honor their pacts and the trusts (held by them)
  23,9,And those who maintain their ´salat´ watchfully
  23,10,Such (believers) will be the heirs
  23,11,They shall inherit the paradise where they shall live for ever
  23,12,"Certainly, We have created man from strands of clay"
  23,13,Then We made him into a drop (of sperm) lodged in an environment of stability
  23,14,"Next, We turned that drop of semen into a clot of blood and then changed that clot into a chunk of flesh. Next, We hardened that chunk of flesh into bones, and clothed the bones with flesh. Finally, We converted it into an altogether different being. Therefore, glorify Allah, the Best of the creators"
  23,15,"Eventually, you would certainly die"
  23,16,"And then, you will certainly be resurrected on the Day of Judgment"
  23,17,"And surely, We have created seven systems (of heavens) over you. We are definitely not unmindful of the creation"
