quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  30,33,"When a calamity strikes mankind, they call their Lord and turn to Him in repentance. When He lets them taste His mercy, many of them go back to ascribing partners to their Lord"
  30,34,(Do they do this) to show ingratitude for everything We have granted them? Go ahead and enjoy! Soon you will find out
  30,35,Did We send them an authority that condones their acts of associating partners (with Allah)
  30,36,"People are joyous when We let them taste Our mercy, but become despondent when trouble suddenly strikes them as a result of their own doings"
  30,37,Do they not see? Allah increases the provisions _ or limits them _ for whomever He wants! In that are surely signs for any nation that believes
  30,38,"Grant the due rights to your near ones, the poor and the wayfarer. That is better for those who seek the pleasure of Allah. They are the successful ones"
  30,39,"You pay interest to the people in order to increase their wealth, but it does not exceed (in value) according to Allah. Yet, the ´zakat´ you give seeking the pleasure of Allah increases manifold (in value)"
  30,40,"It is Allah Who created you and provided for you. Then, He will give you death, and then He will bring you back to life. Is there any among the partners (you ascribe to Allah) who does that? Glorified is He! Far above all the partners (they ascribe)"
  30,41,"Corruption has appeared in the land and in sea because of what people have done to themselves. Now, He will make them taste the result of some of their deeds. Perhaps they might turn back"
