quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,22,"As he headed towards Madyan he said, \"Perhaps, my Lord would guide me on to the right path"
  28,23,"Musa came to the town of Madyan. Near the water supply, he found a group of men supplying their cattle with water. Close by, he found two women trying to keep their animals from drinking. Musa asked, \"What is the matter?\" They replied, \"We cannot take our turn until all other shepherds have supplied their herd. Our father is very old"
  28,24,"Musa took care of their animals. Then, he sat in a shade and said, \"My Lord, I am poverty struck; in (desperate) need of whatever good You may grant me"
  28,25,"Musa saw one of the two young women walking demurely towards him. She said, \"My father wants to see you. He wants to compensate you for taking care of our animals.\" Musa saw their father and narrated all that had happened to him (in Egypt). The man said, \"Do not be afraid. You have escaped the oppressing nation"
  28,26,"One of the two girls said, \"Oh father, hire him! Indeed, the best person to hire is the one who is faithful and firm"
  28,27,"The man said, \"I want you to marry one of my daughters, provided you work for me for eight years _ ten, if you prefer. That is up to you! I do not want to be harsh on you. Allah willing, you will find me a righteous person"
  28,28,"Musa said, \"So, it is settled between you and me. I shall complete one of the two terms. Beyond that, let there be no obligation upon me. Allah is the Guarantor of what we decide"
