quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,55,"It is not improper for the ladies (and will not be held against them), if they converse freely with their fathers, their sons, their brothers and their sons, their sisters´ sons and other women _ including the slave women. Oh women! Fear Allah! Indeed, Allah observes every single thing"
  33,56,Indeed Allah and His angels send their blessings upon the prophet. Oh you who believe! Send your salutes and your sincere greetings upon him
  33,57,"Certainly, those who annoy Allah and the prophet (should beware); Allah has placed a curse on them in this life and in the afterlife. He has prepared for them a humialiating punishment"
  33,58,Those who distress the believing men and women (by levelling false charges against them) without any reason bear the burden of having slandered a believer _ a glaring sin
  33,59,Oh prophet! Ask your wives and daughters and the women of the believers to wrap a loose outer garment completely around their bodies (leaving the face and the figure unobservable). That way they are more likely to be recognised and won´t be harassed. Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful
  33,60,"The hypocrites and those with a disease (of doubt) in their hearts must quit spreading false rumors in the town (Medina). Otherwise, We will most certainly rouse you into action against them. Then they will not remain your neighbors in this town much longer"
  33,61,"Cursed are they! Wherever found, they will be captured and killed in a carnage"
  33,62,Allah has enforced this course of action for all of those gone by earlier. You will never find any departure in the established practice of Allah
