quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,13,"Do they claim that he has made it up himself? Say, \"If that is true, bring us ten such made up chapters, and call for help anyone you can, besides Allah"
  11,14,"Since they fail to respond, know for sure that this is being revealed to you by the knowledge of Allah, and that there is no god except He! Now, will you submit (lit: be Muslims)"
  11,15,Those who prefer the life of this world and its décor will have their due in this life? We will reward their actions and deeds in full right here! They shall not be shortchanged
  11,16,Such people will have nothing in the life-to-come except hellfire. All their efforts in this life will be wasted. All their deeds are in vain
  11,17,"Can there be any likeness between the unbelievers and those following the clear proof from their Lord (the Qur´an), recited to them by His witness. Prior to this, the book of Musa served as a guide, and was a blessing. Fire is the promised place of abode for whichever sect refuses to believe (the Qur´an). Hence do not be in two minds about it. Very definitely, it is the absolute truth from your Lord, but most people do not believe"
  11,18,"So, who can be more in error than the one inventing lies about Allah? They will be presented before their Lord. Witnesses will affirm that they were really the ones inventing lies about their Lord. Beware! Allah´s curse is upon the evil doers"
  11,19,"Those who dissuade others from the path of Allah and try to find fault with it, actually do not believe in the afterlife"
