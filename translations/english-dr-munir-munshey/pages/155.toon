quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,38,"Allah will say, \"Enter the fire along with the generations of humans and jinn that lived before you. As it enters (the hellfire), each generation will curse the group ahead of it. Finally, when they are all together in the fire, each succeeding generation will say about the one preceding it, \"Our Lord, these are the ones who led us astray. Give them twice the torment by the (hell) fire.\" (Allah) will say, \"There is twice the torment for each one of you, but you (just) do not realize"
  7,39,"Each preceding generation will say to the one following it, \"You do not have an advantage over us. Now taste the torment in return for what you have wrought"
  7,40,"Indeed, the gates of heaven shall not open for those who reject Our revelations, and treat them with disdain. A camel may pass through the eye of a needle, but they shall never enter paradise. This is how We punish the criminals"
  7,41,Hellfire shall be the bed under them; and hellfire shall be their blanket to cover them. This is how We punish the evildoers
  7,42,"While those who believe and do the righteous deeds _ and We do not impose upon a soul beyond its capacity to bear _ are the people of paradise. There, they shall live forever"
  7,43,"We will strip away whatever rancor remains in their heart. Rivers shall flow under their feet. They will say, \"All praise is for Allah Who guided us towards this. Never could we have found the right path, had Allah not guided us. The messengers of our Lord had brought us the truth.\" A voice will call out to them, \"You have inherited this paradise as a reward for what you used to do"
