quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,(I swear by) the dawn
  89,2,The ten nights (of the month of ´Hajj´)
  89,3,Even and odd (numbers)
  89,4,And the night as it passes
  89,5,Is there a (more solemn) vow for the sensible ones
  89,6,Are you not aware of what your Lord did to the (people of) ´Aads´
  89,7,Those well known for the high pillars (of their architecture)
  89,8,Such that the likes of them had never been raised in other cities
  89,9,"And (how He dealt) with the people of ´Samood´, who hollowed out huge rocks (and built palaces) in the valley"
  89,10,And with the pharaoh wielding the kingdom
  89,11,Those who transgressed and crossed all bounds in the lands
  89,12,And vastly increased mischief and corruption in the land
  89,13,So your Lord unleashed upon them the scourge of suffering
  89,14,"Indeed, your Lord is ever so vigilant"
  89,15,"Such is man! When his Lord puts him through a test by granting him honor and a life of ease, he says, \"My Lord has honored me"
  89,16,"And when He tests him by restricting his means of livelihood, he says, \"My Lord has disgraced me"
  89,17,"Not at all! In fact, you do not treat the orphans kindly"
  89,18,Nor do you encourage each other to feed the poor
  89,19,"Greedily, you (misappropriate and) devour the inheritance (of the weak, the widows and the orphans)"
  89,20,You love wealth with all your heart
  89,21,"No, of course not! (On the day) when the earth is pounded repeatedly and crushed"
  89,22,"And your Lord (Himself) comes down, along with His angels ranked in rows"
  89,23,"And (the day) the hell is brought (in view), is the day when man shall remember clearly. But rememberance then will be of no avail"
