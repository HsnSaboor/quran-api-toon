quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  28,85,"The One Who ordained this Qur´an upon you would certainly bring you back to your cherished destination (the paradise). Say, \"My Lord knows much better those who have accepted guidance, and those who remained misguided"
  28,86,You did not expect that the scriptures would be revealed to you. It is (nothing but) the Mercy of your Lord. So do not become a source of support to the unbelievers
  28,87,Do not ever let them deter you from (preaching) the verses of Allah after they are revealed to you. (Continue to preach) and call others towards (the way of) your Lord. Do not be among those associating partners with Allah
  28,88,"Excepting Allah, do not call any one else. There is no god but He. (No one except He merits submission). Everything in this universe except His face, will perish. To Him belongs the Command, and to Him will you all be brought back"
  29,1,"Alif, Laam, Meem"
  29,2,"Are people of the opinion that once they said, ´we believe´ they would be left alone and not be put to a test"
  29,3,We had certainly tested those before them. Allah definitely has to sift those who are true to their words from those who are liars
  29,4,Do those indulging in vile deeds assume that they are getting the better of Us? Utterly false is what they decide
  29,5,"Those hoping to meet Allah should note that the scheduled meeting with Allah is really certain to take place. He hears everything, and knows everything"
  29,6,"Whoever strives, does so for his own self. Of course, Allah is (Free of want and) dependent upon no one in the world for anything"
