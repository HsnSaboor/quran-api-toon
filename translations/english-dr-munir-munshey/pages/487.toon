quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  42,32,"And among His signs are (huge) ships, like mountains (floating) in the sea"
  42,33,"If He wants, He can cause the winds to cease. The ships would then lie motionless on the surface of the sea. In fact, there are signs in that for every steadfast and grateful person"
  42,34,"He can destroy (and drown) them as a result of their misdeeds, though he overlooks (and pardons) a lot"
  42,35,Let those who (refute and) dispute Our signs know that they have no refuge
  42,36,"You have really been granted (the bare essentials, and) the brief enjoyment in the life of this world. What exists with Allah is far superior, and better enduring. It exists for those who believe and place their trust in Allah"
  42,37,"(It is for those) who stay clear away from the worst of sins and vile deeds; and when in rage, they (control their anger and) forgive"
  42,38,"(It is for those) who respond to the call of their Lord and establish the ´salat´. They run their affairs by mutual consultation, and spend (for Our sake) out of what We have granted them"
  42,39,"When oppressed and tyrannized, they rise up and retaliate"
  42,40,"The recompense (or reprisal) against an evil deed is (allowed, but should be) a deed of the same kind (and no more). But the one who forgives and makes (overtures of) peace is better. His reward falls due on Allah. Of course, He does not like those who do wrong"
  42,41,Those who have been wronged may (choose to) exact revenge. They are not to be blamed or berated
  42,42,"Rather, blameworthy are those who oppress mankind and commit unjust and flagrant acts in this world. For such people there is a painful punishment"
  42,43,"But, to bear patiently and forgive is indeed an (admirable) act of courage, and a virtue"
  42,44,"The one whom Allah leads astray does not have, besides Him, any protection. When the evildoers see their punishment, you will find them wondering (aloud), \"Is there now a possibility to return, (to rescind and recant)"
