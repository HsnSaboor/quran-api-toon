quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  58,12,"Oh those of you who believe, whenever you seek a private audience with the messenger, present something in charity (to the poor) prior to the consultation. This is better for you _ and purer. (Yet) if you are unable (to offer charity), then Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Kind"
  58,13,"Are you afraid of giving charity prior to your consultation with the messenger? So you may not _ and Allah forgives you for it _ (but) establish ´salat´, pay the ´zakat´ and obey Allah and His messenger. Allah is (well) Aware of what you do"
  58,14,Do you not see the hypocrites? They befriend the nation that has invoked the wrath of Allah. They _ (such hypocrites) _ neither belong to you nor to others (your enemies). They knowingly swear to their falsehood
  58,15,"Allah has prepared a severe punishment for them! Indeed, what they do is really evil"
  58,16,"They use their oaths as their shields, and they prevent people from the path of Allah. A disgraceful punishment is (in store) for them"
  58,17,"Their wealth and their children will not help them a bit against Allah! They are the people of the fire, and in it they shall stay forever"
  58,18,"On that day, Allah will raise them all (back to life), and they will swear before Him just like they swear before you (now). They will fancy that their oaths will bring them some benefits. Beware! They are certainly the liars"
  58,19,"Shaitan has gained mastery over them, and has caused them to become oblivious of the remembrance of Allah. They are the gang of Shaitan. Beware! The gang of Shaitan is definitely the loser"
  58,20,"Indeed, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger are the ones who would be the lowest and the most humiliated"
  58,21,"Allah has decreed, \"I and My messengers shall certainly prevail!\" Allah is the Strongest, and the most Powerful"
