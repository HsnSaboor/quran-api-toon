quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  9,21,"Their Lord gives them the good news of His mercy, His approval, and their (very own) gardens (in paradise) where they shall have (exquisite) ever-lasting rewards"
  9,22,"There, they shall live for ever and ever. Of course Allah has the most awesome rewards"
  9,23,"Oh you who believe! Do not accept as allies (even) your father and your brother, if they prefer disbelief to faith. Those of you who befriend them are really the wrong doers"
  9,24,"Say, \"If (the worldly bonds) _ your father, sons, brothers, wives, other relatives, the wealth you have amassed, the business you fear to lose, and the house you are so fond of _ are dearer to you than Allah, His messenger and the struggle in His path, then wait till Allah renders His decision. Allah does not guide the sinful nation"
  9,25,"Certainly, Allah had given you victories in many battles. In the battle of ´Hunain´, however, your superiority (over your enemy) because of greater number had pleased you. But it did not help you a bit. Despite its vastness, the earth closed in on you. You turned your back and ran"
  9,26,"After that, Allah bestowed peace and serenity upon His messenger and the believers. To help you, He sent down the armies you could not see, and He punished those who denied the truth. Such is the due for the unbelievers"
