quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,23,"Both of them cried out, \"Our Lord, we committed a sin against ourselves! Now, if You did not forgive us, and have mercy on us, we would surely be the losers"
  7,24,"(The Lord) said, \"Get out of here! Both of you _ (humans and Shaitans) _ are each other´s enemy. For a (specified) time, your abode and your provisions shall be on earth"
  7,25,"Said, \"There shall you live, and there shall you die; and from there you shall be raised back to life (on the Day of Judgment)"
  7,26,"Oh children of Adam, We have granted you garments to cover your nakedness, and as means of adornment for you. The best attire is that of piety. This (in itself) is one of the signs of Allah. Perhaps, they would bear (that) in mind"
  7,27,"Oh children of Adam! Do not let Shaitan entice you as he did your (primordial) parents when he got them expelled from paradise. He stripped them of their clothes, in order to expose their nakedness to them. Of course, Shaitan and his tribe watch you from where you cannot see them. Of course, We let the Shaitans be the friends of those who do not believe"
  7,28,"And when they commit an obscene and lewd act, they say, \"We found our ancestors doing that, and Allah has enjoined that upon us.\" Say, \"Absolutely not! Allah never (ever) commands anything lewd and obscene. Do you attribute such lies to Allah, about which you know (absolutely) nothing"
  7,29,"Say, \"My Lord enjoins justice. In every place of worship, set your faces (and attention) towards Him. Invoke Him with sincerity and devotion, by making faith His exclusive domain. You would return to life just like He created you (the first time)"
  7,30,"One group He has guided. Misguidance became the lot of the other group. (Because), they accepted Shaitans to be their patrons and protectors instead of Allah! And they believe that they are on the right path"
