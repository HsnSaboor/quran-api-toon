quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  59,4,"This is so, because they acted in defiance of Allah and His messenger. Whoever goes against (the will of) Allah (should know that) Allah is indeed very Severe in reprisal"
  59,5,"It was with Allah´s permission that you cut down (some of) the date palm trees and left (others) standing on their stems, in order that He might disgrace the evildoers"
  59,6,"Allah granted their possessions to His messenger, as spoils (of war). You did not throw your horses and your camels (in battle) against them. Allah gives dominance to His messenger over whatever He pleases. Allah is capable of (doing) everything"
  59,7,"The booty Allah granted to His messenger from the people of the town is for (the sake of) Allah, His messenger, the relatives (of the messenger), the orphans, the poor (and the needy), and the wayfarers; so that wealth may not get (hoarded) amongst your well to do. Accept what the Messenger grants you and stay away from what he forbids! Fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is very Severe in reprisal"
  59,8,"(The booties are) for the poor immigrants who were driven out of their homes and (deprived of) their belongings, those who seek the bounties of Allah and His pleasures. They help (the cause of) Allah and His messenger! Such are truly the faithful ones"
  59,9,"And the booties are for those who had houses (in the city) and had accepted the faith before others. (Because) they really love the immigrants who were driven out of their homes and came to them (for help). They do not entertain any greed in their hearts for what others have been given. They prefer others over themselves, even though they are poor. Those who escape the greed within their own hearts, are really the successful ones"
