  17,39,This wisdom is revealed to you by your Lord! Do not accept any god other than Allah; else you will be hurled into hell _ cursed and ostracized
  17,40,"(Oh you who accept gods other than Allah), did your Lord favor you with sons while He settled on angels as daughters for Himself? Surely what you utter is a grave thing"
  17,41,"We have repeatedly explained matters in this Qur´an, so they may come to their senses. But it has only intensified their aversion (for the truth)"
  17,42,Say
  17,43,Glorified is He! Exalted and far above what they assert
  17,44,"The seven heavens, the earth, and all those who exist therein, glorify Him. There isn´t anything that does not chant His praises! But you fail to (hear their chants, or) comprehend their manner of praise. Surely, He is Gentle and Forgiving"
  17,45,"As you recite the Qur´an, We station an invisible shield between you and those who do not believe in the afterlife"
  17,46,"We have encased their hearts in covers, so they understand nothing; and their ears are plugged with corks. When you mention none but your Lord in the Qur´an, they scornfully turn their backs on you"
  17,47,"We know (their motives) very well. We know what they (want to) hear when they listen to you closely! When the evildoers talk secretly (with their companions), they say, \"You are merely following a man possessed"
  17,48,See! How they depict you? They have strayed off and cannot find the way
  17,49,"They ask, \"Once we turn into dust and bones, will we be raised back to a renewed existence"
