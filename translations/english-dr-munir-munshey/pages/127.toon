quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,114,"Jesus, son of Mary prayed, \"Oh Allah, Our lord! Send down to us from the heavens a table spread (with food). Let it be an ever recurring feast for us _ for the first and the last of us. Let it be a sign from You. And give us (the sustenance) _ our (daily) bread. For, You are (absolutely) the very Best of the providers"
  5,115,"Allah said, \"I am going to send it down for you. But if any of you disbelieves after that, I will punish him with the torment the like of which I have never inflicted upon any one in the universe"
  5,116,"Allah will say (on the Day of Judgment), \"Oh Jesus, son of Mary! Did you ever instruct people, \"Worship me and my mother as two other gods along with Allah\"? Jesus will answer, \"Exalted are You! It is not my place to say anything I have no right (to say). Had I said that, You would have already known it. You know what is in my mind, while I do not know what is in Your mind. Indeed, You have (absolute) knowledge about (absolutely) everything hidden and unseen"
  5,117,"I said to them only (and exactly) what You had commanded me to say, ´Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.´ I bore witness to what they did as long as I was among them. But, after You recalled me, You _ (and not me) _ were the Watcher over them. For, You are the Witness to every single thing"
  5,118,"If You punish them, then they are of course Your servants. And if You forgive them, You are the Almighty, and the Wisest"
  5,119,"Allah will say, \"This day, the truthful shall receive the benefit of their truthfulness. Theirs shall be the paradise through which run the rivers. They shall live there forever. Allah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him. That is the greatest triumph"
  5,120,"To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and everything therein. He has (absolute) power over all things"
