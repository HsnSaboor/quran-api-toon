quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,The nation of Loot rejected the messengers
  26,161,"Their brother Loot said to them, \"Do you not fear (Allah)"
  26,162,I am surely a faithful (and a reliable) messenger for you
  26,163,So fear Allah and obey me
  26,164,"In return, I do not seek any compensation from you. My reward exists only with the Lord of the universe"
  26,165,Do you commit (the sexual act) with the males in this world
  26,166,"And you forsake the mates that your Lord created for you? Indeed, you are a nation guilty of transcending the limits"
  26,167,"They said, \"If you did not stop, oh Loot, you would most certainly be expelled"
  26,168,"He said, \"I am certainly among those who loathe and abhor your deeds"
  26,169,"He prayed, \"My Lord! Save me and my family from (the evil of) what they do"
  26,170,So We saved him and all of his family
  26,171,"Except an old woman, _ Loot´s wife _ who stayed behind (with the evil doers)"
  26,172,After that We annihilated the rest of them
  26,173,We doused them with a downpour (of brimstone)! A devastating evil rain (fell) upon those forewarned
  26,174,There is surely a sign in this! But most of them do not believe
  26,175,Your Lord is surely the One Who is the most Powerful and the most Merciful
  26,176,And the people of ´Aika´ rejected the messengers
  26,177,"When Shoaib said to them, \"Do you not fear (Allah)"
  26,178,I am surely a faithful (and a reliable) messenger for you
  26,179,So fear Allah and obey me
  26,180,"In return, I do not seek any compensation from you. My reward exists only with the Lord of the universe"
  26,181,Fill the measure to its capacity. Do not inflict a loss (by supplying reduced amount)
  26,182,And weigh with an accurate balance
  26,183,"Do not defraud people of their goods, and do not go about spreading corruption and immorality in this world"
