quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,51,Oh you who believe! Do not accept the Jews and the Christians as your friends. They are each other´s friends. Whoever befriends them is actually one of them. Indeed Allah does not guide the unjust people
  5,52,"Yet, you will see that those with disease (of doubt) in their heart would (always) rush to (befriend) them. They say, \"We are concerned that the fortunes will change and a disaster will strike us.\" But perhaps Allah will grant you victory, or grant you another favor by His grace. Then, these people would feel sorry for the secrets they hold within their hearts"
  5,53,"The believers will say, \"Are these the ones who swore by Allah so solemnly that indeed, they will stand by you?\" Their deeds came to naught and they turned out to be the real losers"
  5,54,"Oh you, the believers! If anyone of you forsakes (and renounces) his faith, (he should know that) Allah will soon bring another people (in your place). Those whom He loves, and who would love Him! They would be lenient and tolerant towards the believers, and stern and unyielding with the unbelievers. They would strive their utmost for the cause of Allah, and would not fear the censure of the critics and the faultfinders. Such is the grace of Allah, which He bestows upon whom He wills. Allah is Boundless and Infinite, and all-Knowing"
  5,55,"In fact, your patron and protector can only be Allah, His messenger and other believers _ those who establish the ´salat´, pay the ´zakat´, and kneel humbly (before Allah)"
  5,56,"Those who accept Allah, His messenger and other believers as their patrons and protectors (will find that) only the party of Allah will triumph"
  5,57,"Oh you who believe! Do not accept as your friends those who mock your faith and treat it as a joke, whether they are among those given the book before you (the Christians and the Jews), or other unbelievers. Fear Allah (exclusively) if you really are the believers"
