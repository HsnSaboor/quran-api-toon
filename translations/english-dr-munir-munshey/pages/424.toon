quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  33,44,"Peace\" will be their greeting on the day they meet Him. He has prepared a generous reward for them"
  33,45,"Oh prophet! We have sent you as a witness, as a bearer of good news and as a warner"
  33,46,"And as the one inviting towards the path of Allah by His will, and as a guiding illuminating lamp"
