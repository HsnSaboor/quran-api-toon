  28,60,The possessions you have been granted are merely the provisions and adornments of the life of this world. What exists with Allah is far better and permanent. Do you not understand
  28,61,"(Consider these two)! To the one We pledged excellent rewards, which he shall soon find true. We had the other enjoy the provisions of the life of this world, and on the Day of Judgment he shall be brought up (for punishment). Can one be like the other"
  28,62,"The day He summons them He will ask, \"Where are My partners _ those you claimed"
  28,63,"Those for whom the verdict is passed will say, \"Our Lord, they are the ones we misled. We led them astray, just like we lost our way. In Your presence, we wash our hands off them. They did not worship us at all"
  28,64,"They will be told, \"Call your partners!\" And call they will! But they shall hear no response. Instead, they will see the torment! If only they had adopted the guidance"
  28,65,"The day He summons them all, He will ask, \"What answer did you give to the messengers"
  28,66,"On that day, all explanations (and excuses) will elude them. They shall be unable to consult each other"
  28,67,"Except the one who repents, then believes and performs good deeds! Such a one would perhaps be successful"

  28,69,"Your Lord knows what their hearts conceal, and (not just) what they declare"
  28,70,"He is Allah! There is none worthy of worship except He. All praise is due Him _ here and in the hereafter! The command and control belong to Him, and to Him you shall all have to return"
