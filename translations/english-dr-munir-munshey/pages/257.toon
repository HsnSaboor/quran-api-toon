quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  14,11,"The messengers said to them \"Of course, we are humans like you! But Allah confers His blessings upon such of His servants as He chooses! Without the will of Allah, we cannot bring you any miracles! The believers should bestow their trust in Allah"
  14,12,"And why must we not place our trust in Allah, when He has already shown us our paths? With patience, we shall bear any suffering You inflict upon us. In Allah alone, must the believers bestow their trust"
  14,13,"The unbelievers said to the messengers, \"We would certainly drive you out of the land, unless you return to the folds of our religion.\" Their Lord disclosed to them (the messengers), \"We will, surely wipe out the evildoers"
  14,14,"In their place, We will settle you in the land. This is for those who fear Our reckoning and heed Our warning"
  14,15,"They sought the decision, and every obstinate oppressor lost out"
  14,16,"Hell lies in wait for such ones! There, to drink he shall have pus-filled discharge from wounds"
  14,17,"With difficulty he will sip it, and with trouble he will manage to swallow it down. Death shall accost him from all sides, but die he shall not! Yet another tough torment shall lie in wait for him"
  14,18,"Those, who reject their Lord, shall not benefit from any of their deeds. Their deeds are like ashes, being blown away by strong winds on a stormy day. Theirs is the blunder of the worst kind"
