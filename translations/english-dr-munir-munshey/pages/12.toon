quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,77,Are they not aware that Allah knows what they narrate in secret as well as what they proclaim
  2,78,Some of them are illiterate and know nothing about the scriptures. They (only) have wishful fancies and (rely upon) conjecture
  2,79,"And misery is for (their scholars,) those who write a book with their own hands and then say, \"This is from Allah!\" In return for that, they acquire a petty price. Woe to them for what they write with their hands! Woe to them for what they earn with it"
  2,80,"And they say, \"The fire will not touch us except for a few days, if at all.\" Say, \"Do you have a pledge from Allah (concerning that)? A firm pledge that Allah will not breach? Or do you say about Allah that, which you do not know"
  2,81,Of course! Those who commit evil and are wrapped (and steeped) in sin will be the inmates of the fire! They shall stay in it forever
  2,82,"While those who believe and do the righteous deeds, are the inhabitants of paradise. In it, they shall live forever"
  2,83,"And (remember) when We entered into a pact with the children of Israel. We said, \"You shall worship none except Allah. You shall be good (and dutiful) to your parents, and kind and courteous to your kindred, the orphans and the needy. You shall be polite to people! (Furthermore), you shall perform the ´salat´ and pay the ´zakat´. But, with the exception of a few, you all turned away and ignored (the pledge)"
