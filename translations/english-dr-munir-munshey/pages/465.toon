quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  39,57,"Then he will say, \"I would have been a God-fearing person, had Allah guided me"
  39,58,"As he witnesses the (oncoming) punishment, he would wail, \"Oh! If I had a second chance, I would be righteous"
  39,59,No! In fact My signs (and guidance) did come to you! And you did reject them. You displayed arrogance. You were the disbeliever
  39,60,"On the Day of Judgment, you will see! The faces of those who invented lies about Allah would be tainted and tarnished. Isn´t there a place in hell for the proud and the haughty"
  39,61,Allah will rescue those who fear the effect (of their actions). Nothing bad will happen to them. They shall not feel sorry
  39,62,"Allah is the Creator of everything, and He is the Guardian over everything"
  39,63,He has the keys to (the treasures of) the heavens and the earth. Indeed the losers are those who reject the signs of Allah
  39,64,"Say, \"Are you then asking me to worship beings other than Allah? You ignorant fools"
  39,65,"It has been revealed to you just as it had been revealed to those before you, that if you commit ´shirk´ (associate partners with Allah) your (good) deeds would surely come to naught, and you would definitely be the losers"
  39,66,"Instead, worship Allah (exclusively) and be grateful"
  39,67,"They did not appreciate or revere Allah as He rightfully deserves to be appreciated. On the Day of Judgment this earth would be (held nipped) in His fist, and the heavens would lie folded across His right (forearm). Exalted is He! Far above everything they associate and affiliate with Him"
