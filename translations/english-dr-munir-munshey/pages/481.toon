quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,39,"One of His signs: you see the land dry and desolate. But it suddenly stirs and quivers, and begins to bear (vegetation) just as soon as He sends down the rain upon it. The One Who gives life to the dead land is surely going to bring the dead back to life. Indeed, He is Capable of doing everything"
  41,40,"Those who twist and distort Our verses are, of course, not unknown to Us. So then, who will fare better on the Day of Judgment? The one flung in the hellfire? Or the one who arrives safe and secure (into paradise)? Do what you want. Of course, He watches (and knows) whatever you do"
  41,41,"These people have refused to accept the advice, (the Qur´an), when it came to them, (though) it is definitely a mighty book"
  41,42,"Falsehood can neither confront it head on, nor approach it (stealthily) from behind. (It is) a revelation from the Wise, the One Worthy of praise"
  41,43,"(Oh Muhammad, SAW)! Nothing has been said to you that had not been said to the messengers before you. Indeed, your Lord is (not only) the Lord of forgiveness, (but also) the Lord of the painful punishment"
  41,44,"Had We revealed (this Qur´an) in a non-Arabic language, they would have said, \"Why are its verses not clear and understandable? What? A non-Arabic (discourse) and an Arabic (audience)?\" Say to them, \"For those who believe, this Qur´an is a guidance and a cure (for spiritual ailments). While, it is a plug for the ears and a blindfold for the eyes of those who do not believe. (It is, as if) they (barely) hear being summoned from a far off place"
  41,45,"We had granted Musa the book; it, (too), was (questioned and) disputed. But your Lord´s word has already been decreed. Had it not been for that, their dispute would have been decided (and settled) once and for all. They remained hopelessly in doubt about it (the book)"
  41,46,"Whoever acts righteously does so for his own sake, and whoever commits evil does himself a bad deed. Your Lord is not unjust to His servants"
