  11,38,"He built a boat. The chiefs of his nation made fun of him each time they passed by. He said, \"Go ahead! Make fun of us. We, in our turn, will make fun of you like you make fun of us now"
  11,39,"You would soon find out, who will be humiliated by the approaching torment, and upon whom will the everlasting punishment land"
  11,40,"At last, when in response to Our orders the oven burst open, We said, \"Board on it a pair of each species (of animals), your family _ except those about whom the decision has already been made _ and the believers.\" Only a few had believed in him"
  11,41,"He said, \"Come aboard. It is going to sail and land in the name of Allah. My Lord is really very Forgiving and very Kind"
  11,42,"So the boat sailed with them amid waves as tall as mountains. Nooh spotted his son standing in an isolated place, and called out to him, \"My son, come aboard with us! And do not be an unbeliever"
  11,43,"(His son) said, \"I will climb over this hill and be saved. This hill will protect me from the floodwater.\" (Nooh) said, \"Today, according to the decree of Allah, there is no refuge except by His mercy.\" A wave shot up between the two and he was doomed to drown"

  11,45,"Nooh called his Lord and said, \"Lord! Surely, my son is my family. Your promise is absolutely true and You are absolutely the Best of the judges"
