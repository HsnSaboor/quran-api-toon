quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  12,31,"When she heard such sly remarks, she threw the ladies of the town a lavish party. During the party, she seated them on couches and gave each of them a knife. Then she asked Yusuf to suddenly appear before them. The ladies saw him and were stunned! Suddenly, (lost in amazement) they sliced their hands with the knife! They said, \"We swear by God! This could not be a man! He has to be an honored angel"
  12,32,"She said, \"This is the one you were taunting me about! I did try to seduce him, but he got away! Now, if he fails to comply with my wishes, he will definitely land in prison and will have to face humiliation"
  12,33,"Yusuf prayed, \"Oh Lord, They are inviting me towards the shameful act, but I prefer the life of prison over it. Please Lord! If You do not turn their wicked wiles away from me, I might succumb to them! If so, I would be among the ignorant wicked ones"
  12,34,"His Lord accepted his prayers and saved him from their evil plot. Surely, He is the One Who hears all and knows all"
  12,35,"Despite the evidence before them, they concluded that they better send Yusuf to prison for a while"
  12,36,"Two other young men had also landed in prison at about the same time. One of them said, \"I dreamt that I was extracting wine\". The other said, \"I saw myself carrying bread over my head and birds were eating out of that bread! Please, interpret our dreams for us! We find you to be so pious"
  12,37,"He said, \"I will tell you the interpretation of your dreams before it is time for you to be served dinner in prison! My Lord has taught this knowledge to me! I have abandoned this (evil) nation. They do not believe in Allah, and they deny the coming of the life-to-come"
