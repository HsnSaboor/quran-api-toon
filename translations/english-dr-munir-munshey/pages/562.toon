  67,2,"(Blessed is) the One Who created the death and life, so He may try and test you; which of you performs the better deeds. He is the most Powerful, and the most Kind"
  67,3,"The One Who created seven tiers of heavens, one atop another! You do not find any disparity or disharmony in the creation of Rehman, (the most Merciful). Cast another look! Do you find any breach (in the heavens)"
  67,4,"(Go ahead)! Look again and again. Your eyes would wear out, and your sight would (wander and) return to you, bewildered and in vain"

  67,9,"They would reply, \"Yes! A warner had indeed come to us, but (alas)! We rejected him and said: \"Allah has revealed nothing! You have just (blundered and) slumped into a grave error"
