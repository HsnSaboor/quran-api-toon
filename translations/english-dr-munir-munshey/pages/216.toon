quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,62,Beware! The friends of Allah shall have no fear; nor shall they ever grieve (or be sorry)
  10,63,Those who believe and guard against evil
  10,64,"The glad tidings are for them in this world, and in the afterlife. The words of Allah are immutable! That, indeed, is a tremendous triumph"
  10,65,Let their remarks not aggrieve you! Honor and power of all sorts belong to Allah! He hears all and knows all
  10,66,Beware! Everyone in the heavens and on the earth belongs to Allah! Those calling others besides Allah are not following any ´partners´ (of Allah). They merely run with their assumptions. They only indulge in conjectures
  10,67,"He has made the night, so you may find rest; and He has made the day bright. Surely, in it are proofs for any nation willing to listen"
  10,68,"They say, \"Allah has taken a son!\" Exalted is He! He is free of all needs! Everything in the heavens and on the earth belongs to Him! Do you have an authority to say that? Or do you claim about Allah that, concerning which you have no knowledge"
  10,69,"Say, \"Liars, who invent falsehood about Allah, do not prosper"
  10,70,"Their possessions are but small provisions for this life only! Later, they must journey back to Us! Then, because of their disbelief, We shall have them taste a severe torment"
