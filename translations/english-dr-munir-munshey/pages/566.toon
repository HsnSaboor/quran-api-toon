quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  68,43,"Downcast would be their eyes (in shame); disgrace shall overwhelm them. They were asked to prostrate in this life, when they were sound and solid"

  68,46,"Or, do you ask them for a fee (or a reward)? Are they laboring under the burden (of such a demand)"
  68,47,"Or, do they have the knowledge of the unseen so they may write (their own fate)"
  68,48,"So, wait patiently for your Lord´s decree. Do not act like the man of the fish, (the prophet Jonah), when he called (his Lord), choked with grief"

  69,5,So the Samoods were wiped out by the lightning (and the thunderbolt)
  69,6,While the ´Aads´ were destroyed by the violent howling winds
  69,7,"For seven hideous days and eight gruesome nights, He let the winds ravage them. (Had you been there), you could see their bodies tossed about (and strewn around), as if they were the hollowed out trunks of the date trees"
