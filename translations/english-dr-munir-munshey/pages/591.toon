  86,2,And how would you know what the night star is

  86,4,There is no soul without a guardian over it
  86,5,Let man look at (and bear in mind) the substance he is created from
  86,6,(He is) created from the surging fluid
  86,7,Which springs from between the spine and the ribs
  86,8,"Indeed, He is (certainly) capable of bringing man back to life"
  86,9,"That day, (all) secrets would be laid bare"
  86,10,"(That day), man shall not have any strength, nor any helpers"
  86,11,(I swear) by the sky that repeatedly sends rain down
  86,12,And by the earth that splits (and lets plants emerge)
  86,13,"Indeed, this Qur´an is the statement that sifts (right from wrong)"
  86,14,It is not an idle tale
  86,15,They are hatching a nefarious plot
  86,16,"But I, too, shall devise a scheme"

  87,9,"So remind (men), for reminder surely helps"
  87,10,"The one who fears, will surely heed"
  87,11,And the wretched will stay aloof
  87,12,And then he will roast in the mammoth fire
  87,13,Where he shall never die; nor be alive
  87,14,Successful has been the one who purified himself
  87,15,"And, remembered the name of his Lord and performed the ´salat´"
