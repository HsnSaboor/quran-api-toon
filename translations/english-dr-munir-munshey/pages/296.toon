quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,21,"In that miraculous manner, We made them (the people) stumble upon (that cave). So that they would know for sure that Allah´s promise is real, and that there is no doubt about the hour (of judgment). But instead, they carried on their dispute and said, \"Let us build a monument over them. Only their Lord knows the truth about them!\" Those who were in charge said, \"We shall definitely turn the site into a place of worship"
  18,22,"They will say, \"(That they were) three, the fourth was their dog.\" Others also conjecture (and put the figure at) five, counting the dog six. Still others say, \"Seven! Their dog was the eighth.\" Say, \"My Lord knows their true number! Others know only very little.\" So, do not discuss that about them except cursorily, nor inquire anyone about them"
  18,23,"And regarding anything, do not say, \"I will do that tomorrow"
  18,24,"(Rather add), \"If Allah pleases!\" (Insha Allah)! Should you forget this, then remember your Lord (when you recall) and say, \"Perhaps, my Lord will lead me towards that which is more appropriate, and a sensible conduct"
  18,25,"They stayed in that cave for three centuries, and nine more years"
  18,26,"And say, \"Allah knows exactly how long they stayed! To Him belong the secrets of the heavens and the earth! He hears (everything) clearly, and He sees (everything) plainly. They have no patrons besides Him, and He includes none in His decisions and domain"
  18,27,And recite (without modification) the revelation from the book of your Lord. No one may change the words of your Lord! (If you did) you will not find any safe place from Him
