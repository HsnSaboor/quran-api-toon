quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,87,(He is) Allah! There is no god but He! He will most certainly gather you on the day of resurrection. There is no doubt about that! Who could be more truthful (and sincere) in his assertion than Allah
  4,88,"Why are there two opinions among you concerning the hypocrites? Because of the wrong they have wrought, Allah has made them revert (to disbelief). Do you wish to guide the one whom Allah has led astray? You will not find any way out for the one whom Allah misleads"
  4,89,"The hypocrites wish that you would reject faith just like they have. Then, you will (descend down to their level and) be equal to them. Therefore, do not choose them as friends unless they (emigrate and) leave their homes in the path of Allah. If they revert (to open hostility), then seize and slay them wherever you see them. Do not take them as friends or protectors, nor as helpers"
  4,90,"Except for those (hypocrites) who find refuge with a nation with whom you have a treaty! Or unless they come to you such that their hearts cringe and neither allow them to fight you, nor their own people. Had Allah willed, He would have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. Therefore, if they stay aloof and do not fight you, or if they make overtures of peace, then Allah has given you no reason to commit aggression against them"
  4,91,"You will find other hypocrites who seek to stay safe from you, as well as from their people. But, (as soon) as they are tempted with a lure, they plunge headlong into mischief. If they do not stay neutral, and do not make overtures of peace towards you, and do not restrain their hands, then seize and slay them wherever you see them. In their case, We have given you a clear sanction"
