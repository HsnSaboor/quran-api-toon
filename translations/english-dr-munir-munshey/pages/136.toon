quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,69,"The righteous bear no responsibility for the actions of others, though they must admonish (the wrongdoers). Perhaps, they will fear (Allah)"
  6,70,"Stay away from those who treat their religion as nothing more than play and pastime. The life of this world has (dazzled and) deceived them. By (means of) this (Qur´an), call their attention to the fact that the soul is held in pledge against the deed it earns. They have no protector or mediators besides Allah. Absolutely, no ransom of any kind will be accepted in exchange for their deeds. Such ones would be held (responsible) for their deeds. Boiling water will be their drink, and because they used to deny, they will face a painful punishment"
  6,71,"Say, \"Shall we call others besides Allah _ others who can neither help nor harm us? After being guided by Allah, we would be making an about face and turning back to misguidance! In that case, we would be like the one enticed by Shaitan. He strays in the land confused and bewildered. His (sincere) friends call him towards guidance, saying, Come to us! Say, \"Only Allah´s guidance is the (real) guidance. Our orders are to submit to the Lord of the universe"
  6,72,"And (we are ordered) to establish ´salat´ and to be obedient to Him. For it is He, before Whom we shall all be gathered"
  6,73,"It his He Who based the creation of the heavens and the earth upon the absolute truth. The day (of Resurrection) shall instantly come about as soon as He says (to it), \"Be!\" His word is the (infallible and the ultimate) truth. On the day the trumpet sounds, the rule and the judgment shall belong solely to Him. He knows the unseen and the seen. He is the Wisest and the most Aware"
