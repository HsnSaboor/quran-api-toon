quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,80,"Allah provided houses for you to rest and stay in peace, and from the hides of cattle He brought about for you the tents (temporary abodes). You find it light as you pitch it to stay, and as you pack it to travel. From the wool, fur and the hair of cattle, He brought about furnishings and other benefits for you __ all for a while"
  16,81,"Allah brought about shelters and protection for you out of what He created. He provides you refuge in the mountains (caves), the garments to shield you from heat, and the shirts to shield you from injury (during combat). Thus, He made His blessings complete upon you! Perhaps, you would bow in obedience"
  16,82,"Of course, in case they ignore and turn away, your obligation is to convey the message in clear and precise terms"
  16,83,"They recognize the blessings of Allah, and yet renounce them! Most of them are unbelievers"
  16,84,"On that day, out of every nation We will call out a witness to testify against them. The unbelievers, then, will neither be allowed to offer excuses, nor urged to seek forgiveness"
  16,85,They will witness their inevitable torture! Their sentence will not be lightened! Nor shall they have a respite
  16,86,"Those guilty of ascribing partners to Allah, will spot those partners (on the Day of Judgment) and will cry out, \"Oh our Lord, these are the ones we used to worship besides You!\" In response, they will retort, \"You are liars"
  16,87,"On that day, they will extend an offer of peace towards Allah. The lies they used to invent will fritter away"
