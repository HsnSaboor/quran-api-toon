quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,6,The obligation to feed all living beings on the earth is upon Allah. He knows their resting places and their final depositories. Everything is inscribed in a clear book
  11,7,"And it is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods of time _ His throne was over water _ in order to test you and to see which of you performs better deeds! In fact, when told that after death they will be raised (back to life), the unbelievers say, \"This is definitely magic"
  11,8,"When We postpone the punishment for a brief period, they taunt, \"What kept it?\" Beware! The day it (actually) lands on them, they will not be able to keep it away. That which they joke about, will engulf them"
  11,9,"When We deprive man of Our blessing after first having him taste it for a while, he turns blue, becomes ungrateful and loses all hope"
  11,10,"On the other hand when, after a period of hardship, We let him taste Our blessings, he says, \"The bad times are finally over\" and he starts to boast"
  11,11,But those who are steadfast and do good deeds (do not boast); theirs shall be the forgiveness and a tremendous reward
  11,12,"(Oh prophet)! Perhaps you would (feel inclined to) give up a part of the revelation. Perhaps your chest tightens up when they, (the unbelievers), taunt, \"Why was a treasure not sent down for him?\" and \"Why did an angel not accompany him?\" Actually, you are there only to warn, and Allah is responsible for all matters"
