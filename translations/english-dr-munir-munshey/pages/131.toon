quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,28,"Actually, the reality which was previously kept hidden from their vision, has now become apparent to them. If they are sent back they would revert back. They would commit exactly the same acts they had been forbidden. They are really the liars"
  6,29,"They say, \"This life of ours is it, and (after death) we are not going to be raised back (to life)"
  6,30,"If you could only see them presented before their Lord (for reckoning). He will ask, \"Is this not real?\" They will reply, \"Yes, Our lord! this is real!\" He will say, \"Now taste the punishment _ a consequence of your denial"
  6,31,"The real losers, indeed are those who denied the meeting with their Lord! Once the hour (of Judgment) creeps up on them suddenly, they would say, \"Alas! How negligent had we been!\" And they would carry their burden of sins on their backs. Beware! Grave is the burden they carry"

  6,33,"We do know that their remarks cause you grief. But it is not just you they are calling a liar. Rather, these evildoers have actually rejected the revelations of Allah"

Of course, nobody can revise or reverse the decisions (and decrees) of Allah! The tales of the (earlier) messengers have certainly reached you"
  6,35,"If their attitude is so hard for you to bear, then dig a tunnel through the earth if you can; or find a ladder (to climb) up to the sky. Try and bring them the miracle (they demand). Had Allah so willed, He could have, (on His own), gathered all of them around His guidance. So, do not be like the foolish and the ignorant"
