quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,27,"Even after all that, Allah will accept the repentance from whomever He wants. Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful"
  9,28,"Oh you believers, (remember)! those who ascribe partners to Allah are really unclean. Therefore, after (the pilgrimage) this year let them not come (anywhere) near the sacred mosque (in Makkah). If you fear poverty, Allah may soon enrich you as He wills. Indeed, Allah is the most Aware, the Wisest"
  9,29,"Fight against the people of the book _ those of them who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, do not forbid that which Allah and His messenger have forbidden, and do not follow the religion of truth. (Fight against them) till they (agree to) pay ´jazia´ (the submission tribute) and accept an inferior status"
  9,30,"The Jews said, \"Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allah\", and the Christians said, \"Jesus is the son of Allah.\" These are (nothing but mere) words that escape their lips. They just (ape and) echo the words of the unbelievers of earlier times. Allah´s curse is upon them! How (easily) are they being deceived"
  9,31,"Instead of Allah they accepted their scholars, their monks, and (above all) Jesus son of Mary, to be their gods. In fact, they were commanded to worship (none but) the One (true) God. There is no god but He. Exalted is He, far above the partners they associate with Him"
