quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,195,"And their Lord responded to their prayers, \"I never waste the efforts of any doer (of good deeds) among you _ whether a man or a woman. You are descendants of each other. I will surely cleanse the offenses committed by those who emigrated and were driven out of their homes _ those who were (harassed and) persecuted in My cause; (those who) fought and were slain (for My sake). I will definitely admit them into the gardens (of paradise) through which run the rivers. (That is) the reward from Allah; and Allah has the most excellent rewards"
  3,196,Do not ever let the (pomp and) prosperity of the unbelievers in the land fool you (or cause you to envy them)
  3,197,"(This is but) a brief enjoyment! After that, their abode is hell; it is, of course, the worst resting place"
  3,198,"Whereas, there exist gardens of paradise _ through which run the rivers _ for those who fear their Lord. (A generous gift of welcome) _ a hospitable reception from Allah! That which exists with Allah for the devoted and the dutiful, is much better"
  3,199,"There are certainly some among the people of the book who believe in Allah, and in that which is revealed to you, as well as that which was revealed to them (earlier). Humbly, they submit to Allah; they do not trade away the revelations of Allah for a paltry price. Such ones shall receive their reward from their Lord. Indeed, Allah is prompt in settling scores"
  3,200,"Oh you who believe! Persevere patiently, bear (hardship) steadfastly, be ready (for the right deed) and fear Allah! Perhaps you will prosper"
