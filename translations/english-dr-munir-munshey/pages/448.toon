quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"He used to say (to me): are you also one of those who believe"
  37,53,That we would be asked to face the reckoning even after we turn into dust and bones
  37,54,"He would be asked, \"Would you look at him now"
  37,55,He would look and spot his ex-friend in the thick of the blazing fire
  37,56,"He would call out (to his ex friend in the hellfire), \"I swear by Allah, you had all but ruined me"
  37,57,"Had it not been for my Lord´s blessings, I would be there (burning in the hellfire) with you, right now"
  37,58,"(Happily, he would muse), \"Are we never going to die now"
  37,59,Was our death in our previous life final? Are we never going to be punished
  37,60,"That, indeed, is a tremendous triumph"
  37,61,Those desirous (of success) should strive for just such an outcome
  37,62,Isn´t a gracious feast (in paradise) better than the tree of ´zaqum´
  37,63,We have deemed that tree to be a test for the evildoers
  37,64,That tree springs forth from the very bottom of hell
  37,65,Its buds (and crop) resemble the heads of Shaitans
  37,66,The evil doers will have (nothing but) that to eat. They will stuff their stomachs with it
  37,67,They will get (only) boiling water (to gulp down the ´zaqum´)
  37,68,After (such a meal) they will come right back to the blazing fire of hell
  37,69,"(Their crime): they found their parents astray"
  37,70,Yet (without thinking) they rushed along in their (parents´) footsteps
  37,71,(Even though they knew that) the earlier people (blundered and) had gone astray
  37,72,We certainly raised messengers among them to warn them
  37,73,So look at how those people forewarned met their end. The fate that they fared
  37,74,But the sincere and the obedient servants of Allah (will be safe)
  37,75,"Earlier, Nooh called Us and We responded. We are simply the Best of those who respond"
  37,76,We rescued him and his household from an awful torture
