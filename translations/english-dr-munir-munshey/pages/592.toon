quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,"No! In fact, (most of) you prefer the life of this world"
  87,17,Although the hereafter _ (the life-to-come) _ is far superior and more enduring
  87,18,"Certainly, this (is what) was (written) in the earlier scriptures"
  87,19,The scriptures of Ibraheem and Musa
  88,1,Has the news of that overwhelming (calamity) reached you
  88,2,(Many) faces that day would be (panic struck and) down cast
  88,3,Weary and toiling
  88,4,Burning in the scorching fire
  88,5,Made to drink from the boiling spring
  88,6,"And having nothing to eat, except (the bitter thorny) cactus"
  88,7,Not enough to nourish or curb the hunger
  88,8,(Other) faces that day would be happy (and blissful)
  88,9,Well pleased with (the outcome of) their efforts
  88,10,In the exalted paradise
  88,11,"There, they shall hear nothing vile or foolish"
  88,12,"In paradise, there are gushing springs"
  88,13,And elevated thrones
  88,14,And carved (exotic) goblets
  88,15,And cushions set in rows
  88,16,And spread out (lush rich) carpets
  88,17,Do they not look at the camel (and wonder)? How (superbly) is it created
  88,18,And at the sky; how (high) is it raised
  88,19,And at the mountains; how (firmly) are they planted
  88,20,And at the earth; how (wide) is it spread out
  88,21,"So, (continue to) remind (them). Indeed, you are (a messenger) to remind (them)"
  88,22,You are not (appointed) a warden over them
  88,23,As for the one who turns away and disbelieves
  88,24,Allah will punish him with the direst torment
  88,25,"Of course, back to Us is their return (journey)"
  88,26,"Indeed, to call them to accounts is upon Us"
