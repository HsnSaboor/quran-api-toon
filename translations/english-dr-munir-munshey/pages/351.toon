quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,11,"Those who brought up a slanderous lie (against the messenger´s wife) are but a small faction amongst you. Do not consider it bad for yourself. Rather, it is beneficial for you! Each of them is liable for the sin to the extent of his involvement. But the greatest torment is for the one among them who assumed the major responsibility"
  24,12,"Why didn´t the believers _ men and women _ assume virtue for one of their own _ (a believer)? When you heard such a thing, why did you not say, \"This is quite obviously a lie"
  24,13,"Why did they not bring four witnesses (to back the allegations)? Since they failed to come up with the witnesses they, in the sight of Allah, are the liars"
  24,14,"Allah has bestowed upon you His favors and His mercy, in this world and the life-to-come. Else, a great torture would have inflicted you because of the unrestrained gossip you indulged in"
  24,15,"With your tongues, you spread (the lie), and with your lips you uttered that about which you had no knowledge. You considered the matter trivial, but according to Allah, it was very grave"
  24,16,"When you heard it, why did you not say, \"It is not proper for us to discuss such a thing! Exalted are You (Oh Allah), it is a treacherous slander"
  24,17,Allah cautions you against behaving like that ever again _ if you are really the believers
  24,18,And Allah explains to you His verses clearly. Allah is the all-Knowing and the all-Hearing
  24,19,A painful punishment _ in this world and in the afterlife _ awaits those who want sexual waywardness and obscenity to spread through the believers. Allah knows it (all) while you know nothing (at all)
  24,20,(And it would have spread) had it not been for the mercy of Allah and His favors upon you. Allah is the most Gracious and the most Merciful
