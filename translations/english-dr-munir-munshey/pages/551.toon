quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  60,12,"Oh prophet! Accept the pledges of the believing women, when they come to take their oaths of allegiance to you. Provided, they pledge that they would not join any partners with Allah, would not steal, commit adultery or kill their children, and would not indulge in slander, and would not concoct lies on their own. Also, that they would not disobey you in what is right. Seek forgiveness for them from Allah! Certainly Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful"
  60,13,"Oh you who believe! Do not befriend the people who have incurred the wrath of Allah. Just like the disbelievers lying in their graves, they too have abandoned all hope about the afterlife"
  61,1,"Everything in the heavens and on earth chants His praises; He is the Mightiest, the Wisest"
  61,2,"Oh you who believe, why do you say that which you do not (intend to) do"
  61,3,"It is greatly despised by Allah that you should say something, and then not do it"
  61,4,"Indeed, Allah loves those who fight in His path, organized and arrayed as if they were a single solid structure"
  61,5,"(Remember), when Musa said to his people, \"Oh my people, why do you annoy and irritate me? You already know that I am really the messenger of Allah for you!\" (But) when they deviated (from the truth), Allah made their hearts turn further away (from the truth). Allah does not guide the sinful people"
