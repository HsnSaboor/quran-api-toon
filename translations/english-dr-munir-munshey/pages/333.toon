quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  22,6,That is so because Allah is the absolute Reality! And because He grants life back to the dead! He is capable of accomplishing everything
  22,7,(Because it proves) that the hour of judgment is surely bound to come! No doubt about that! And that Allah will resurrect all (the dead) in their graves
  22,8,"Some people argue about Allah, although they do not have any knowledge, guidance or an illuminating book"
  22,9,"Arching their necks conceitedly, they misguide people and drive them away from the path of Allah. Disgrace awaits them in this life, and on the Day of Judgment We shall have them taste the torture by fire"
  22,10,"This is what your own hands have wrought. Surely, Allah does not oppress His servants"
  22,11,"There are some people who worship Allah, but stay on the sidelines. If something good happens to them they are contented. But as soon as they are placed in a situation of trial, they undergo an about face and turn away. They lose out in this world, and also in the next! That, surely is a real loss"
  22,12,"Instead of Allah, they pray to such deities that can inflict no harm, and award no benefits. That is surely the worst kind of misguidance"
  22,13,"They pray to the one whose harm outweighs the benefits. Evil, indeed, is such a patron, and evil is such a companion"
  22,14,Allah will surely admit those who believe and act righteously into paradise. Rivers run right through it. Allah does what He wills
  22,15,"If anyone thinks that Allah will fail to help him (Muhammad, SAW) in this life and in the afterlife, then let that someone stretch his means to reach the heavens and traverse it. Let him see if his tricks can negate anything, including that which angers him"
