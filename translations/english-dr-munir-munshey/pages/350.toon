  24,2,"Let both _ the man and the woman _ guilty of illicit sexual intercourse be punished with a hundred lashes each. If you really believe in Allah and the Day of Judgment, you will not let compassion hold you back from (implementing) the laws of Allah. A party of believers should be around to witness the punishment"
  24,3,"The adulterer may marry none except an adulteress or a pagan, and the adulteress may be wedded only to an adulterer or a polytheist. It is prohibited for the believers (to marry an adulteress or let an adulterer marry the believing woman)"
  24,4,"Flog those who accuse any of the chaste women (of committing adultery), but fail to backup (their charges) with four eyewitnesses. Flog them with eighty lashes, and thereafter do not accept their testimony ever again. Surely, they are the wicked ones"
