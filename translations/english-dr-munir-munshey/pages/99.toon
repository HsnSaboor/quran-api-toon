quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,128,"In case a woman fears abuse, mistreatment or desertion by her husband, there is nothing wrong for the two of them to compromise and come to terms. It is better to make peace (and restore harmony). The soul is certainly swayed by greed. If you are righteous and ward off evil, then (be assured that) Allah is very well Aware of everything you do"
  4,129,"Even if you (sincerely) desire (and try), you will not be able to maintain equality among (all) your wives. So do not lean towards one to an extent that you leave others (apprehensive and) in abeyance. If you mend your ways and fear (Allah), then indeed Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful"
  4,130,"If the husband and wife (decide to) separate, Allah will provide sustenance to both of them out of His abundance. Allah is the Infinite, the Wisest"
  4,131,"To Allah belongs everything in the heavens and on earth. We had instructed those who received the scriptures before you and (now We instruct) you too, (Oh believers), that you should fear Allah. But if you reject, then (remember that) everything in the heavens and on earth, does indeed belong to Allah! And Allah is Free of all wants and Worthy of all praise"
  4,132,"Yes indeed, everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to Allah, and Allah suffices as an advocate _ (He is worthy of your trust)"
  4,133,"Oh you people, if He wills He can make you extinct and bring others in your place! Allah has the power to do (that and) everything (else)"
  4,134,"Anyone who prefers (to receive) the result and the recompense in the life of this world, (should know that) Allah has the rewards (to bestow) not only in this life, but also in the life-to-come. Of course, Allah hears-all, and observes everything"
