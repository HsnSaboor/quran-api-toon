quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,"In fact, those who do not believe in the afterlife are actually the ones who give the angels the female names (and gender)"
  53,28,"About this they definitely have no knowledge. They merely go by their assumptions, but when it comes to (the search for) the truth, the assumptions do not help a bit"
  53,29,"So ignore the ones who turn away from Our reminder, and desire only the life of this world"
  53,30,"That is the extent (and limit) of their knowledge! Indeed, your Lord knows best who has strayed from His path; and He also knows the rightly guided ones"
  53,31,"To Allah belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. So that, He may punish rightfully and in accordance with their deeds, those who commit evil; and so that He may bestow the excellent rewards upon those who are righteous"
  53,32,"If those who steer clear of the grave sins and the shameful vile deeds stumble and err, (let them remember that) Allah abounds in forgiveness. He knows you so well, ever since He created you and established you on earth, ever since you were but a germ in your mother´s belly. Therefore, do not profess purity and piety for yourself. Allah knows better the one who is pious"
