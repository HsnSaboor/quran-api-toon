quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  33,63,"People ask you about (the exact time and date of) the hour (of Judgment). Say, \"In fact, the knowledge about that is with Allah (alone). You do not realize! That hour might just have drawn very close"
  33,64,"Indeed, Allah has cursed the unbelievers. He has prepared for them a blazing fire"
  33,65,"In it, they will live for ever. There, they will not find a friend or a helper"
  33,66,"That day, their faces will be roasted on (an open) fire; they will say, \"Alas, if only we had obeyed Allah, and had obeyed His messenger"
  33,67,"They will (further) say, \"Our Lord, we really obeyed our leaders, the influential and the distinguished among us. But they misled us and made us lose the way"
  33,68,"Our Lord, inflict upon them twice the punishment, and place upon them a mighty curse"
  33,69,"Oh you, the believers! Do not be like those who harassed Musa. Allah cleared him of what they alleged. According to Allah, he was a distinguished messenger"
  33,70,Oh those of you who believe! (Always) say the right thing
  33,71,"He will rectify and correct your deeds, and He will forgive your sins. Those who obey Allah and His messenger have indeed achieved the greatest success"
  33,72,"Indeed, We presented this trust (the Qur´an) to the sky, the earth and the mountains, to see if they would accept the responsibility that goes with it. They shied away and declined to bear it. But man assumed the obligation. Man was indeed cruel (to himself) and ignorant (of its importance)"
  33,73,"(Having accepted, man is liable and) Allah will punish the hypocrite men and women, and the polytheist men and women. He will forgive the believing men and women. Allah happens to be the most Forgiving and the most Merciful"
