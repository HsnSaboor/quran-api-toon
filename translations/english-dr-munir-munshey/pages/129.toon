quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  6,9,"If We had sent down an angel, We would have sent him as a human. Thus, they would have had doubts again, just like they do now"
  6,10,"Certainly, many messengers have been mocked before you, but those who made fun of them were surrounded and overwhelmed by the very thing they used to mock"
  6,11,"Say, \"Move about in the land and observe how severe was the final outcome for all those who denied the truth"
  6,12,"Ask them, \"To whom belongs everything in the heavens and on earth?\" Say, \"To Allah!\" He has mandated mercy upon Himself. He would most certainly (bring you back to life and) gather all of you together on the day of Resurrection. There is no doubt about it! Those who have incurred a severe loss, and have ruined themselves, are the ones who refuse to believe"
  6,13,"To Him belongs everything that dwells in the night and the day. He hears-all, and knows-all"
  6,14,"Say, \"Shall I take anyone other than Allah as my protector, even though He is the Creator of the heaven and the earth? He feeds (all), is not (in need to be) fed (by anyone).\" Say, \"I have been ordered to be the first to submit.\" (My orders are) \"Do not be among the Idolaters _ (those who join partners with Allah)"
  6,15,"Say, \"I am really afraid of the punishment of an awesome day, if I disobey my Lord"
  6,16,The one kept away from that (torment) has indeed been shown (the ultimate) mercy. That is the greatest triumph
  6,17,"If Allah chooses to inflict harm upon you, no one except He can provide relief. However, if He grants you a blessing, then of course He has power over all things"
  6,18,"He holds an absolute and total control over His servants. He is the Wisest, and the most Aware"
