quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  18,84,We established him firmly in the land and laid at his disposal the means to obtain everything
  18,85,He undertook a mission
  18,86,"And reached the land of the setting sun. He saw the sun setting behind the murky hot springs. And he found a people living there nearby. We said, \"Oh Dhul Qurnain! You may punish them, or treat them nicely"
  18,87,"He said, \"We will punish the evil doer ourselves. Later, he returns to his Lord, Who will punish him with a woeful torture"
  18,88,"(Dhul Qurnain said), \"But the best of reward _ (paradise) _ is for the one who believes and acts righteously. We will treat him with kindness"
  18,89,Then he undertook another mission (eastward)
  18,90,(And pressed on) till he reached the land of the rising sun. He found the sun rising upon a (primitive) people. We had not arranged any shelter for them against the sun
  18,91,Such (was their state); and We knew exactly what he (Dhul Qurnain) possessed
  18,92,Then he went on yet another mission
  18,93,Until he reached a mountainous area and found in the valley a people who understood almost nothing
  18,94,"They said, \"These Yajog and Majog run amock in the land. May we pay you a tax to have a barrier erected between them and us"
  18,95,"Said, \"(Thanks, but) the power my Lord has granted is enough (and far better)! Just help me with your manpower. I shall build a wall between them and you"
  18,96,"Bring me blocks of steel.\" He blocked up the valley between the mountains (with a wall of steel) and said. \"Now start a fire and blow (air through your bellows) till the wall becomes red hot.\" Then he said, \"Bring me the molten copper to pour over the (iron) wall"
  18,97,The barbarians could neither scale (the wall) nor breach it
