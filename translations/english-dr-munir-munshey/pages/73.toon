quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,174,And they came back (home) with the blessings and bounties of Allah. No harm came to them! They (coveted and) sought the approval (and acceptance) of Allah; and Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty
  3,175,"The fact is, it is Shaitan who instills (into you) the dread of his (disciples and) allies. But don´t be afraid of them! Rather, if you are the believers, fear Me"
  3,176,"Do not be saddened by those who rush (willingly) into disbelief. Indeed, they will not hurt Allah in any way. Allah has willed that He will not assign any share for them in the life-to-come. For them there exists a terrible (most awful) torment"
  3,177,"In fact, those who purchase disbelief, at the expense of belief, would never hurt Allah at all. There is a painful punishment for them"
  3,178,"The unbelievers should not consider it good for them (in anyway), that We have granted them some respite. In fact, We have withheld (Judgment) in their case, so they may (amass and) add to their sins. For them, there exists a humiliating (most disgraceful) punishment"
  3,179,"Allah is not going to leave the believers in the (same) state they are in. He will (sift, sieve and) set apart the wicked from the virtuous. Allah will not disclose the unseen (mysteries of the universe) to them (individually). For that, Allah selects messengers from among them, whomever He wants. So, believe in Allah and His messenger. You shall have a gracious reward, if you believe (in Allah) and fear (Him)"
  3,180,"There are those who stingily cling to what Allah bestows upon them by His grace. (They don´t give charity). Let them not think that it is good for them. In fact, it is woeful (and perilous) for them. On the Day of Judgment, they would be strapped and shackled (around the neck) by that which they (now) hoard (so eagerly). The heritage of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah; and Allah is well Aware of everything you do"
