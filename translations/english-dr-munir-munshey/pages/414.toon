quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  31,29,"Do you not observe? Allah causes the night to take over the day, and He pushes the day over the night. He tamed the sun and the moon. Each of them is in motion for a specified term. Allah is well Aware of everything you do"
  31,30,"That is so, because Allah is the absolute truth, and besides Allah every one else they pray to is utterly false. Indeed, it is Allah Who is the Exalted and the Eminent"
  31,31,"Do you not observe? It is due to His favor, and in order to show you His signs, that the ships sail on the sea. In that are surely signs for every steadfast and grateful person"

  31,33,"Oh you people! Fear your Lord and dread that day when a father would not make amends for (the sins of) the son, and the son would not atone for (the sins of) his father.

  31,34,"Indeed, the knowledge of the (exact) hour (of Judgment) is with Allah. It is He Who sends down the rain. He knows that which is (growing) in the wombs. No living being is aware of what it will earn the next day. No living being knows, in what land will it die. But indeed, Allah knows it all! He is aware of everything"
