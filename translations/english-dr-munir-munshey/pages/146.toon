quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,138,"Of their own accord, they (make certain rules and) declare, \"(The meat of) this animal and (the crop of) that field are prohibited. No one can eat its (meat, fruit or) produce except whomever we allow.\" They prohibit certain animals to be employed for farm labor (or for burden). On certain other animals they do not invoke Allah´s name (at the time of their slaughter). They invent lies against Him! Soon He will punish them for the falsehood they invent"
  6,139,"They Say, \"The yield of certain cattle _ (be it milk or calf) _ is reserved for our males and is forbidden for our females.\" Yet men and women can both share the calf, if it is born dead. Soon We will punish them for all they (falsely) attribute (to Him). Indeed, He is the Wisest, the most Aware"
  6,140,"Those who killed their children out of folly and the lack of knowledge, incurred a great loss. So did those who forbade themselves the blessings that Allah had bestowed upon them, those who fabricated lies about Allah. They have gone far astray; they are not on the right path"
  6,141,"It is He Who has brought into being the orchards _ trellised and otherwise _ the date trees and the fields of crops. They all bear different taste. (He produces) the olives and the pomegranates which are similar in kind and different in taste. Eat their fruit as they ripen and pay the ´zakat´ on the day of harvest. Do not be wasteful. Indeed, He does not like those that are wasteful"
  6,142,"(He created) some animals as beasts of burden, others for the sake of their flesh (and milk). Eat (the flesh of animals) Allah has granted you, and do not follow in the footsteps of Shaitan. He is really your professed enemy"
