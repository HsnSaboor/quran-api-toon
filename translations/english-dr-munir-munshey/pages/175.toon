quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"Say, \"I possess no power to gain any benefit for myself, nor to evade any harm; except whatever Allah wants. If I had any knowledge of the unseen future I could have amassed an abundance of wealth, and no misfortune would have ever touched me. I am only a warner, and a bearer of good news for the believing nation"
  7,189,"He it is Who created you (all) from a single being, then out of that (one being) created its mate. So that man may live with her in peace (and love). When man embraces her, she conceives a tiny fetus which she hardly notices. Later, when she becomes heavy (and begins to show) both parents pray to Allah, their Lord, \"If You grant us a healthy (child) we shall be grateful"
  7,190,"When He grants them a healthy (child), both begin to attribute it to the partners they have ascribed. Exalted is Allah, far above what they associate with Him"
  7,191,"Do they assign those who create nothing as the partners of Allah? Rather, they are themselves the created beings"
  7,192,"Such partners cannot offer them any support. In fact, they cannot even help themselves"
  7,193,"If you invite them towards guidance, they will not follow. It is all the same to them whether you call out to them or stay silent"
  7,194,"The others you invoke besides Allah, are merely human beings like yourself. Call them! If you are truthful they should answer you back"
  7,195,"Do they have feet they could walk with? Or do they have hands they could hold with? Do they have eyes to see, or ears to hear? Say, \"Summon (those you have installed as) your partners, then plot and do your worst against me. Do not give me a respite"
