quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  15,91,Those who separated the Qur´an into fragments
  15,92,By your Lord! We will definitely call them all to accounts
  15,93,About what they used to do
  15,94,"So, proclaim as commanded, and ignore the idol worshippers"
  15,95,We are more than sufficient against those who scoff
  15,96,Those assigning other gods besides Allah will soon come to know
  15,97,"Of course, We know that their remarks sting your heart"
  15,98,Chant the praises of your Lord! Be among those who fall prostrate
  15,99,"And remain obedient to your Lord, right until your death"
  16,1,Allah´s decree is here! But do not scramble towards it! Exalted is He! Far above all those they associate with Him
  16,2,"He sends the angels, and through them reveals His command to His servant _ whomever He chooses _ that there is no god except Me! So, fear Me"
  16,3,He created the heavens and the earth with a purpose. He is far above all (false gods) they associate with Him
  16,4,"He created man from a drop of fluid. Yet, man is now hostile and argumentative"
  16,5,He created the cattle for you! Warmth and other benefits in them exist for you; you also eat their meat
  16,6,"In your cattle, you have a sense of an aesthetic grace; you herd them home at sundown; at dawn you bring them out to graze"
