quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,"(The believers would be sitting) on elevated thrones, looking on"
  83,36,"Now, have the unbelievers not been paid in full for what they did"
  84,1,When the sky splits apart
  84,2,"And heeds its Lord´s command, as it truly must"
  84,3,When the earth distends
  84,4,"Casts off its contents, and becomes bare and blank"
  84,5,"It will heed its Lord´s command, as it truly must"
  84,6,"Oh man! Indeed, you are steadily advancing towards your Lord. You shall meet Him"
  84,7,"Then, the one who is given his record (of deeds) in his right (hand)"
  84,8,Will truly face a light (and lenient) reckoning
  84,9,And will happily return to his folks
  84,10,But the one who is given his record of deed behind his back
  84,11,Will call for (his own) death
  84,12,But will roast in the fiery blaze
  84,13,"(In his life), he had been happy (and contented) among his kin"
  84,14,And (spuriously) assumed that he would never have to come back (to his Lord)
  84,15,Why not? His Lord was (always) watching all his deeds
  84,16,"No! Really, I swear by the sunset glow"
  84,17,"And the night, and everything it enshrouds"
  84,18,And the moon when it is full
  84,19,"You would definitely move along, from one stage to another"
  84,20,What is with them? Why don´t they believe
  84,21,"When the Qur´an is recited before them, why do they not fall prostrate"
  84,22,"Instead, the unbelievers refuse to accept"
  84,23,"Indeed, Allah (alone) knows what (kind of) deeds they collect"
  84,24,So give them the news of a painful punishment
  84,25,"(Which will strike all), except those who believe and perform righteous deeds. For them, there exists an unrestricted, ever-lasting reward"
