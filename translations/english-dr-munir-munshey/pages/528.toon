  53,45,"And He it is, Who created (you in) pairs _ male and female"
  53,46,From the sperm as it is emitted
  53,47,And resurrection (the birth into the afterlife) is (an obligation) upon Him
  53,48,"And it is He, Who grants (His provisions) in abundance, or just enough"
  53,49,"And He is the Lord of (the star), Sirius"
  53,50,He destroyed the ´Aads´ of the former (era)
  53,51,And the ´Samoods´! None (of the rebels) did He spare
  53,52,And the nation of Nooh before them! Indeed they were wicked and wanton
  53,53,"And He it is, Who overturned the cities lying upside down _ (the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah)"
  53,54,"That, which covered those cities, covered them completely"
  53,55,(Oh humans)! Which one of the (many) blessings of your Lord would you ignore
  53,56,This (prophet) is a warner! Like the earlier warners
  53,57,"That day, which is destined to arrive _ (the day of resurrection) _ is approaching fast"
  53,58,"Except Allah, no one can prevent its arrival"
  53,59,(Oh you who disbelieve)! Do you express amazement at this Qur´an
  53,60,You laugh and do not cry
  53,61,"Haughtily, you hold your heads high"
  53,62,"(Instead, you better bow down your head), fall prostrate before Allah and worship"
  54,1,The hour (of Judgment) draws closer. The moon split apart
  54,2,"When they see a clear sign, they turn away and say, \"(It is) an enduring illusion"
  54,3,"They rejected (the truth), and followed their own whims. All matters must come to conclusion (at the appointed time)"
  54,4,"Surely, stories have come to them (from the past) with sufficient moral example to restrain them (from being arrogant)"
  54,5,profound wisdom (has come)! But little do warnings benefit them
  54,6,"(So, oh prophet), turn away from them! That day, the caller shall summon them towards an unpleasant and onerous thing"
