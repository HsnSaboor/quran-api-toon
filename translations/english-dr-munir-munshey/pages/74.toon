quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,181,"Allah certainly heard the taunting remarks of those who said, \"Allah is poor, while we are rich.\" We will record their remarks, and also the fact that they have killed the prophets without a just cause. We will say (to them), \"Here! Taste the torment of the blazing fire"
  3,182,This is (precisely) what your own hands have caused. Allah is certainly not unjust to His servants
  3,183,"(There are) those who said, \"In fact, Allah has bound us by a pledge, that we shall not accept (anyone as) a messenger, unless (he performs the miracle of sacrifice, whereby) his offering is devoured by the (divine) fire (from the sky).\" Say (to them), \"Messengers had come to you before me with very clear signs including the one you have mentioned. Why then, did you kill them, if you are truthful"
  3,184,"(Oh Muhammad, SAW), if they reject you, (remember that) many messengers prior to you had been rejected, including those who brought very clear proofs, the scriptures, and the illuminating book"
  3,185,"Every soul shall have to taste death! The day of Resurrection is when you (can and) shall receive your dues to the fullest extent _ (the consequence of your deeds).

  3,186,"You will most certainly be tested by means of your possessions and your own person. You would definitely hear (many) hurtful remarks, (insults, and affronts) not only from those who were given the scriptures before you, but also from those who associate others with Allah. (Despite that), if you persevere patiently, and be pious, then that is indeed an act of courage and fortitude"
