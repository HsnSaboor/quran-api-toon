quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  14,6,"And Musa said to his people, \"Do you recall the blessings of Allah? He liberated you from the tortures of the pharaohs. They inflicted horrid suffering upon you when they slaughtered your sons and let your womenfolk live! That was, indeed, a gruesome trial from your Mighty Lord"
  14,7,"And your Lord proclaimed, \"If you are grateful, I will grant you much more. Should you be ungrateful, My retribution is very severe, indeed"
  14,8,"And Musa said, \"What if you express ingratitude, you and everyone else in the world together? Even then, Allah is Free of all wants; He is Praise-worthy"
  14,9,"Have you not heard the tales of those gone by __ the people of Nooh, Aads, Samoods, and others after them? Now, no one knows them except Allah. The messengers brought them clear proofs! But they shoved their hands in the messengers´ mouths, _ (forbade them to speak) _ and said, \"Here! We reject what you were sent with. We are reluctant and skeptical about your message"
  14,10,"The messengers replied, \"Do you have misgivings about Allah, Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He offers to forgive your sins and to grant you an extension for a prescribed period.\" They said, \"You are only humans like us, and you intend to turn us away from the deities our parents worshipped. Bring us a convincing miracle first"
