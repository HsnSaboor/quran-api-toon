quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,44,"Do you think most of them listen, or ponder? They are like animals! Nothing more! In fact, they are (worse; they are) more astray from the right path"
  25,45,"Do you not see how your Lord spreads out darkness? If He wanted, He could make it permanent! But He appointed the sun as a pilot (to drive away the darkness)"
  25,46,Thus We gently seize (the darkness) and gradually ease it away
  25,47,It is He Who made the night don the decor that is fit for sleeping; and He made the sleep invigorating for you. He made the day a time to wake up

  25,49,"So that, with it We may bring the dead land back to life and quench (the thirst of) a great many cattle and people We have created"
  25,50,And We repeat this (feat) in their midst in various ways (and often enough) in order to impress upon them (the truth). But most people (being ungrateful) insist upon disbelieving
  25,51,"If We wanted, We could have raised a warner in every single locality"

  25,55,"Besides Allah, they worship those who do not confer benefits upon them, nor cause them harm. The unbeliever always aids (Shaitan) against his Lord"
