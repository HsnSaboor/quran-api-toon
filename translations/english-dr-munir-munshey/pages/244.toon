quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  12,70,"Then, as he packed their luggage for departure, he hid the peg in his brother´s baggage. (When the caravan departed), the announcer called, \"Oh you people of the caravan! You are thieves"
  12,71,"They came forward and asked, \"What have you lost"
  12,72,"The king´s peg is missing!\" they said, \"A reward of a camel load of grain has been announced (for its recovery). We are the guarantors of that peg"
  12,73,"They said, \"By Allah, you know us. We have not come to make trouble in the land! We are not thieves"
  12,74,"He said, \"So what should be the punishment of the thief, if you are lying"
  12,75,"They said, \"He, in whose baggage the stolen goods is found, should be arrested and kept along with the goods. That is how we punish the transgressors"
  12,76,"First, he searched the baggage of others. Then came to his brother and produced it (peg) from his baggage! Thus, We played a trick on them, and found an excuse for Yusuf. The law of the king did not allow Yusuf to keep his brother! We elevate in status, whomever We please! And over all those with knowledge, there is the One Who is the all-Knowing"
  12,77,"They said, \"He is not alone! His brother, too, had committed a theft earlier.\" Yusuf swallowed that remark and disclosed nothing. In his heart, he said, \"You are indeed, of an evil status! And Allah knows what you describe"
  12,78,"They said, \"Oh chief, his father is really very old. Keep one of us in his stead! We find you to be a kind hearted person"
