quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  48,10,"Indeed, those who took the oath of allegiance to you, (oh Muhammad, SAW), were in fact pledging their allegiance to Allah. It was actually Allah´s hand over their hand! So now, whoever violates (the pledge) does so to his own detriment. Allah will grant a generous reward to the one who (faithfully) fulfills the covenant with Him"
  48,11,"The wandering Bedouin Arabs, those who (deliberately) lagged behind, will (no doubt) say to you, \"Our assets and our families kept us busy. So pray (to Allah) for our forgiveness.\" With their lips they utter that which is (just) not there in their hearts. Say, \"Does anyone have even the slightest ability to stop Allah, if He intends to hurt you _ or help you? Allah is well Aware of what you do"
  48,12,"In fact, you thought that the messenger and the believers would not ever return (from their mission) to see their families, and that thought heartened you. You imagined and anticipated the worst (for them). You are a worthless wicked people"
  48,13,"Whoever does not believe in Allah and the messenger (should be warned that), for the unbelievers We have really prepared a blazing fire"
  48,14,The kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah. He pardons whom He wants and punishes whom He wants. Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Kind
  48,15,"Those who lagged behind will (no doubt) say, \"Let us be with you when you leave for the loot (and the spoils of war).\" They (actually) intend to modify the word (and the verdict) of Allah! Tell them, \"You shall not accompany us now. Allah has already said so, earlier.\" Then, they would say, \"In fact, you are discriminating against us.\" On the contrary, they are the ones who hardly understand anything"
