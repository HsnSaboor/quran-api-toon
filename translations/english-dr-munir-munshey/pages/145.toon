quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,132,Each soul is ranked according to its deeds. Your Lord is not unaware of anything they do
  6,133,"Your Lord is Free of all wants; (He is) the Lord of Mercy. If He wants, He can wipe you out, and have another people _ whomever He wants _ succeed you, just as He raised you from the genes of a different nation"
  6,134,"Of course, what you are being promised shall definitely occur! You are unable to prevent it"
  6,135,"Say, \"Oh my people, you do as you please! I will do my part! Soon you will find out, who gets the house of the hereafter. Evildoers will certainly not prosper"
  6,136,"They assign a share for Allah out of the crops and cattle bestowed upon them by Him. They claim, \"This (share) is for Allah, and that is for our partners (of Allah).\" But seldom does their partners´ share reach Allah. However, Allah´s share frequently ends up with their partners. How despicable are their decisions"
  6,137,"Their partners have even made infanticide adorable for many of these idolaters. These partners led them to their destruction, and obscured (and mystified) the matters of their faith. Had Allah so willed, they could not have done that. So leave them alone and let them continue to fabricate falsehood"
