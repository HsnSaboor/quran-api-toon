quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,71,Oh people of the book! Why do you drape the truth with falsehood? (Why do) you knowingly conceal the truth
  3,72,"A faction of the people of the book said (to each other), \"At the start of the day, express belief in what has been revealed to the believers, but renounce it in the evening. Perhaps, (by such means) they would (repudiate and) turn back (from their beliefs)"
  3,73,"(They say), \"Do not believe anyone unless he follows (the tenets of) your (own) sect.\" (To that), say, \"The true guidance, in fact, is the guidance of Allah!\" (They also say), \"Do not believe that another (prophet) is granted the same (revelation) as was (once) given to you. Otherwise, they will argue with you before your Lord.\" Say, \"Indeed, the bounties (of all sorts) are in the hands of Allah. He grants (whatever He wants to) whomever He wants. Allah (and His mercy) is Boundless; He is the all-Knowing"
  3,74,"He selects (and singles out) for His mercy, whomever He wants. Allah is the Lord of great honor"
  3,75,"Among the people of the scriptures are some who would readily return (your trust) to you, even if you entrust them with a lot of money. Among them are also those who would not pay you back, even if you entrusted him with a single ´dinar´, unless you stand over them (and demand it) constantly. This is so, because they say, \"There is no liability upon us about matters concerning the illiterate _ (the non-jews).\" They deliberately utter lies about Allah"
  3,76,"On the contrary! Whoever fulfills his pledge, and fears (Allah, will find) that Allah of course loves those who adopt piety"
  3,77,"Of course, those who trade away the covenant of Allah and their own pledges for the paltry price (in this world), shall have no share in the life-to-come. On the day of Resurrection, Allah will not talk to them, nor (will He even) look at them; and He will not cleanse them (of their sins). For them, there exists a painful punishment"
