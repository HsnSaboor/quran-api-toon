quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  67,13,"(Little does it matter whether you) whisper your words in secret, or shout them out aloud! He is indeed aware of everything, (every thought) that passes through the heart"
  67,14,"Why would He not know? He is the Creator! He is the all-Knowing, well Aware of every subtle detail"
  67,15,"He it is, Who subdued the earth for you (and made it a comfortable and controllable habitat). So move along its surface and eat the food provided by Him. But (remember), towards Him is your (revival and) resurrection"
  67,16,"Are you unafraid that He, the One in heavens (Allah), will not let the earth swallow you? That it will not suddenly begin to rock (as in an earthquake)"
  67,17,"Are you unafraid that He _the One in heaven, (Allah) _will not unleash a violent hurricane upon you? Then you would learn in a hurry how (true and terrible) was My warning"
  67,18,"Of course, (most of) their predecessors had (also) refused to believe. So (observe), how (devastating) was My wrath (and punishment)"
  67,19,"Do they not look at the birds above them? They flap and fold their wings (and fly)! No one but Rehman, (the Merciful), holds them up (in mid air). Indeed He is the One watching over every single thing"

  67,21,"If He withholds His bounties from you, do you have anyone else who could grant you the provisions? The fact is, they hide behind their pride, and their (irrational) aversion (to the truth)"
  67,22,"So who (do you think) is better guided? The one crawling on his face groping (to find his way), or the one walking upright along the straight path"

  67,24,"Say, \"It is He Who has spread you across the earth; and (in the end) you would be summoned back to Him"
  67,25,"They say, \"When will that promise come to be, if you are truthful"
  67,26,"Say, \"That knowledge lies solely with Allah; in fact I am simply a warner"
