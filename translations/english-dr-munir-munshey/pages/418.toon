quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  33,1,"Oh prophet! Fear Allah and do not follow the unbelievers and the hypocrites. In fact, it is Allah Who knows everything, and is the Wisest"
  33,2,"Follow the revelation sent to you by your Lord. Indeed, Allah is well Aware of what all of you are doing"
  33,3,"In Allah, place your trust. Allah is sufficient as a trustee"
  33,4,Allah has not placed two hearts in any person´s body. He does not render your wife to be like your mother simply because you swear and declare her to be like your mother. He does not consider your adopted sons to be like your own begotten sons. These are mere expressions that escape your lips. Allah declares the truth and guides you on to the (right) path
  33,5,"Call your adopted sons by their (real) fathers´ names. That is more upright according to Allah. Should you not know their fathers, then of course, they are your brothers in faith and your companions. What you utter by mistake will not be held against you, unless you assert it consciously from the bottom of your heart. Allah is the oft Forgiving and the most Merciful"
  33,6,"The prophet has precedence over all believers, more than their own lives. His wives are their mothers. According to the book of Allah, the blood relatives take precedence over other believers and the ´mohajirs´ (believers who abandon their homes for the sake of Allah). But, of course, you may do your friends favors! Such is the writing in the book of decrees"
