quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,197,"The month of Hajj (is specified and fixed, and) is well known. Whoever decides to perform Hajj (must visit the sacred House) during that month (and) must abstain from sexual relations. He must abstain from wickedness, and wrangling of all sorts. Allah knows whatever good you do. For your journey, pack and carry along with you the provisions and supplies. (However), the best provision to bring along is piety. Fear Me, oh men of reason (and intellect)"
  2,198,"You incur no sin if you seek the bounties of your Lord (by trading during pilgrimage). When you leave the plains of ´Arafat´ in multitudes, remember (and glorify) Allah (a lot) near the sacred ground of ´Mushar´. Remember Him as (much as) He has guided you. Prior to this, you were certainly unguided"
  2,199,"Then, move along with the multitude of people moving along. Seek the forgiveness of Allah. Indeed, Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful"
  2,200,"Again, when you have concluded the rites of Hajj, remember (and glorify) Allah like you used to remember your forefathers; in fact, even more than that _ (and with a greater zeal). Among people are those who say, \"Our Lord, grant us your bounties in this life.\" Such ones shall have no part (of the blessings) in the life-to-come"
  2,201,"Among people are some who say, \"Grant us the blessings in this life, as well as the blessings in the life-to-come, and save us from the torment of hell"
  2,202,Such people shall have their due share of blessings (in this life as well as the life to come) according to what they have earned. Allah is very swift in settling accounts
