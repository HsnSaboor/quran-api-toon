quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,92,"You will never attain piety (and virtue), until you spend that (in the cause of Allah), which you love (and hold so dear). Allah has full knowledge of whatever you spend (in His cause)"
  3,93,"Every (kind of wholesome) food was (deemed) lawful for the children of Israel, but Israel, (prophet Jacob), forbade himself (certain food on his own) before the Torah was revealed. (Oh Muhammad, SAW), say (to the Jews), \"Bring out the Torah, and recite it to us, if you have been truthful"
  3,94,Those who invent lies about Allah after that would indeed be the evildoers
  3,95,"Say, \"Allah speaks the truth! So, (forsaking all others), follow the creed of Ibraheem as a (fervent) devotee. He was not an idolater"
  3,96,"Of course, the very first house (of worship) built for mankind is certainly the one in Makkah. (It is) full of blessings and guidance for the entire world"
  3,97,"In that (House) are many clear signs _ (for example) the place where Ibraheem stood (and prayed). Whoever enters it obtains (inner) peace (and security). Mankind owes it to Allah to perform the pilgrimage of the House __ anyone who can (afford and) find the means to do so. But if anyone refuses (to perform the pilgrimage), then of course, Allah (is Self-sufficient and) stands in no need of (anyone in) the universe"
  3,98,"Say, \"Oh people of the Book, why do you deny the signs of Allah? Allah is the witness to every thing you do"
  3,99,"Say, \"Oh people of the book, why do you drive away those who believe from the path of Allah? Why do you seek to make the path seem crooked, even though you are the witness (that it is the straight path)"
  3,100,"Oh you, who believe! If you (heed and) obey (any of) the groups that received the scriptures (earlier), they will make you the disbelievers even after you have believed"
