quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"And those who believe were wondering out loud, as to why no revelation has been sent down (exhorting fighting to defend themselves)? Did you observe? When the definite order about fighting was revealed, those with diseased hearts stared at you like the one about to faint with the fear of death! So, evil is for them"

  47,24,Have they never pondered over this Qur´an? Or do they have locks placed on their hearts
  47,25,"They turned away, even though the guidance itself had convinced them of its truth. Therefore, Shaitan deceived them and gave them false hope"

  47,27,"Imagine when the angels will take possession of their souls, slapping their faces and their backs"
  47,28,"Their good deeds lost their worth, because they followed that which displeases Allah, and because they dislike seeking the pleasure of Allah"
