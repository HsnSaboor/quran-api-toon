quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"Say, \"Does any of the partners (you ascribe to Allah) initiates creation, and then renews it?\" Say, \"Allah has initiated the creation and He will start it anew. So, aren´t you being misled"
  10,35,"Ask them, \"Does any of the partners (you ascribe) guides towards the truth?\" Say, \"Allah guides towards the truth! So, which one merits your obedience? The one who guides towards the truth, or the one who does not, and instead remains in need of guidance? What is the matter with you? How do you make your choices"
  10,36,"Most of them follow nothing but conjectures. When it comes to the truth, conjectures do not suffice at all. Surely, Allah has the real knowledge of what they are doing"
  10,37,"This Qur´an isn´t a thing any one can invent, except Allah. Indeed, it confirms and expands upon the scriptures that already exist _ (the Torah and the Gospels). It contains nothing doubtful; and it is from the Lord of the Universe"
  10,38,"Do they say he has made it up himself? If you are truthful, bring just one such chapter; and except Allah, call any one you can (to help)"
  10,39,"Actually, they rejected that, (the Qur´an), which they failed to comprehend. Its full significance has yet not dawned upon them. Those before them, too, had rejected! So, observe their fate! What became of the evildoers"
  10,40,"There are those among them who believe, and those who do not. Your Lord is better aware of the mischief-makers"
  10,41,"Should they reject you, say, \"I have my task and you have yours; you are absolved of anything I do, just as I am blameless for your acts"
  10,42,"Among them are those who seem to hear you. Would you then, try to make the deaf hear, even though he understands nothing"
