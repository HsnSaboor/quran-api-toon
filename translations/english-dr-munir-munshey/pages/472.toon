quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,41,"Oh my people, how (strange) is it, that I call you towards salvation but you respond by inviting me towards the hellfire"
  40,42,"You are asking me to reject Allah and set up partners with Him. I know nothing about (any partners)! The One I call you towards, (Allah), is the most Powerful and the most Forgiving"
  40,43,"No doubt at all! The one you are calling me towards, (Shaitan), in fact has no authority _ neither in this world, nor in the afterlife! Our return is surely towards Allah, and the transgressors are surely the companions of the fire"
  40,44,"Soon you will recall what I am telling you now. I entrust my affairs to Allah. Indeed, Allah watches over His servants"
  40,45,"So, Allah protected that believer from the evil schemes they hatched (against him). Instead, a treacherous torture engulfed the pharaoh (and his followers)"
  40,46,"Now, every morning and every evening they are brought before the fire; (and that will continue unabated) until the day the hour of judgment takes place. (Then, the order would be), \"Throw the pharaoh and his people into an even worse torture"
  40,47,"And (imagine) when they would argue with each other in the hellfire. The weak (in this life) would say to those who deemed themselves important, \"We followed you, because we were under your dominion and control. Are you now able to help us avoid some (of the pain and suffering) of the fire"
  40,48,"Those who pretend to be great would reply, \"We are all in it together. Allah has already settled (all matters) between people"
  40,49,"Those in fire will say to the keeper of hell, \"On our behalf, would you (please) ask your Lord to ease our punishment for just a day"
