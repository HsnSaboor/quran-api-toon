quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,"Indeed, he pondered and plotted"
  74,19,"Cursed is he, the plot he hatched"
  74,20,"Once again, damned is he! What a plot he hatched"
  74,21,"Then, he looked around (haughtily)"
  74,22,"Frowned, and signaled his displeasure"
  74,23,"Finally, he turned back and displayed arrogance"
  74,24,"Then said, \"It is nothing but (the same old) magic handed down from antiquity"
  74,25,"It, (the Qur´an), is merely the word of a mortal"
  74,26,"Soon, I will fling him (and roast him) in that scorcher _ (the hell)"
  74,27,And what do you think the scorcher is
  74,28,"It would not spare (anything or anyone), nor would it leave them alone (by finishing them off)"
  74,29,It will (scorch and) shrivel the human flesh
  74,30,And over that (scorcher) are nineteen (angels standing guard)
  74,31,"We have chosen to appoint the angels as wardens over hell, and We let their number be a trial for the unbelievers. So that, those given the scriptures may believe, and the believers may increase in their belief. Both _ those given the scriptures and the believers _ may not entertain doubts. Yet, those with disease in their hearts, and the unbelievers, would still say, \"What does Allah mean by this example?\" Thus, Allah leads astray whom He wants, and guides whom He wants. No one knows the forces of Allah except He. This is nothing but a reminder for the mortals"
  74,32,No! (I) swear by the moon
  74,33,"The night, as it retreats"
  74,34,And the dawn as it glows
  74,35,"Indeed, it (hell) is surely one of the mightiest (signs)"
  74,36,A warning for the mortals
  74,37,"(Now), anyone of you who wishes may proceed (towards excellence), or lag behind"
  74,38,Every soul is (mortgaged and) held (as security) against the (evil) deeds it has wrought
  74,39,"Except (the righteous ones), those on the right hand"
  74,40,(They would be) in the paradise; (and) they shall ask
  74,41,The criminals
  74,42,What has caused you to end up in this scorcher
  74,43,"They would reply, \"We were not among those who established the ´salat´"
  74,44,Nor among those who fed (and cared for) the poor and the destitute
  74,45,"(Instead), we joined those who indulged in idle prattle (against the truth)"
  74,46,And we denied the (coming of the) Day of Judgment
  74,47,Till the inevitable (death) came upon us
