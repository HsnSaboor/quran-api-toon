quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  27,36,"When the envoys arrived (with their gifts), Sulaiman said, \"Do you wish to increase my wealth (and get me to postpone my invasion)? What Allah has granted me is far superior to what He gave you. No! Keep your gifts and delight in them"
  27,37,"Go back to them! We will surely attack them with our armies. They do not have enough power to resist. We will definitely expel them from the land, humbled and disparaged"
  27,38,"(Sulaiman) said, \"Oh you my courtiers, which one of you will bring me her throne before they yield and surrender to me"
  27,39,"One of the strong jinn said, \"I will bring it to you before you get up from your seat. I am surely reliable and strong enough for it"
  27,40,"The one with the knowledge of the book said, \"I will bring it to you in the blink of an eye.\" Right away, Sulaiman saw the throne placed nearby. He said, \"All this is by the grace of my Lord Who tests me to see whether I show appreciation or display arrogance. The one who offers thanks surely does so for his own good. And if someone neglects to express gratitude, then Allah is indeed Generous and Free from all want"
  27,41,"(Sulaiman) said, \"Disguise her throne (and casually arrange) for her (to view it). Let us see! Would she recognize (her throne)? Or is she one of those who stay ignorant of reality"
  27,42,"When she arrived she was asked, \"Does that look like your throne?\" She replied, \"It sure seems like the one!\" (Sulaiman observed) \"We were given the knowledge before her. We obeyed and became Muslims"
  27,43,She was hindered because she used to worship those other than Allah. She belonged to an unbelieving nation
  27,44,"She was invited to enter the palace. When she looked at it, she thought it was a shallow water-filled pool. So, she lifted her skirt uncovering her legs. Sulaiman said, \"This palace is really made of polished glass with water running underneath.\" She cried out, \"My Lord, I have been unjust to myself. In the company of Sulaiman, I now surrender to Allah, the Lord of the universe"
