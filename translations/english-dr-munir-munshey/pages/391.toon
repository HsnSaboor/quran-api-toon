  28,45,"After them, We raised many generations. A long time has gone by since then. You were not living in Madyan to recite Our verses to them. Rather, it is We Who really reveals these events to you"
  28,46,"You were not there at the side of (the mountain) Toor when We called (Musa). But this revelation is a blessing from your Lord, so you may warn your nation. Prior to you, We had not sent them a warner. Perhaps they would bear that in mind"
  28,47,"If a torment had hit them as a result of their own doing, they would have said, \"Our Lord, why did You not send us a messenger. We would have followed Your signs and would have been among the believers"

  28,49,"Tell them, \"Go ahead! Present a book from Allah which has a better guidance than these two _ (the Qur´an and the Torah)! If so, if you are true to your word, follow it"
  28,50,"And if they do not respond. know it for sure that they are worshipping their own whims and wishes. Who can be worse than the one following his own lusts instead of the guidance of Allah. Indeed, Allah does not guide the evildoers"
