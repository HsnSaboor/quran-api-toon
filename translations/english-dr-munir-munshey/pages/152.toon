  7,13,"(We) said, \"Come off it! You have no right (or reason) to (fancy and) flaunt your (imagined) eminence. Get out! You are among the disgraced (and banished)"
  7,14,"(Shaitan) said, \"Grant me time till the day they are raised (back to life)"
  7,15,"(Allah) said, \"You are granted the time"
  7,16,"(Shaitan) said, \"(Lord), since You lured and led me astray, I would now lurk in ambush for them on Your straight path, (to drive them astray)"
  7,17,"Then, (to deceive them) I will approach them head on, as well as from their rear, and from their right and the left sides. You will not find most of them grateful"

  7,19,"Oh Adam! You and your wife may live in paradise and eat anything here that you like. But do not come close to this one tree, or else the two of you would become the wrongdoers"
  7,20,"But Shaitan whispered doubts to both of them. He wanted to expose their nakedness to them, which was kept hidden from them. He said (to them), \"Your Lord forbade you (the fruit of) this tree, so you would not turn into angels or become immortal"
  7,21,"He swore to the two, saying, \"I am really your well-wisher"
  7,22,"With deceit and deception, he brought about their fall. When they tasted the (fruit of that) tree, their nakedness became visible to them. They began to cover their nakedness with the leaves of paradise. Their Lord called out, \"Didn´t I forbid you that tree? Didn´t I warn you both that Shaitan is your professed enemy"
