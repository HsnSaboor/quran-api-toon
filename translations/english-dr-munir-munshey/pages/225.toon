quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,"And, oh my people! I am not asking for any compensation in return. My reward, if any, is with Allah. I am not going to shun the believers. Indeed, they will meet their Lord! But I see that you are an irrational people"
  11,30,"And, oh my people, who will help me against Allah if I were to shun them! So, why don´t you heed"
  11,31,"I do not claim to have the treasures of Allah, or to be aware of the unknown, or to be an angel. I don´t agree with you that Allah will never award anything good to those you consider humble. Allah knows well what is in their hearts. I would be an evildoer if I shunned them"
  11,32,"They said, \"Oh Nooh, you have quarreled with us a lot! Enough of that now! If you are honest, go ahead and have that promise (punishment) wrought upon us"
  11,33,"(Nooh) said, \"Allah, if He wants, will inflict (the punishment) on you. You are really unable to prevent it"
  11,34,"Even though I advise you sincerely, my advice will not benefit you if Allah wants to lead you astray. He is your Lord and you would have to return to Him"
  11,35,"Do they say he has made it all up? Say, \"If I have made it up, I will face the blame. I, too, am absolved of the sins you commit"
  11,36,"Nooh received the revelation, \"Surely, now none of your people will believe, other than those who already have! Do not grieve over their deeds"
  11,37,"Build a boat under Our supervision and instructions. Do not talk to Me about the evil doers. For sure, they shall all drown"
