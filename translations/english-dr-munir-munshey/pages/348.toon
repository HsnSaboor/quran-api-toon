quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,90,"We did disclose the truth to them! But of course, they are the liars"
  23,91,"Allah did not adopt a son. Nor is there another god along with Him. Else, each god would draw his creation apart and withdraw. Each would attempt to overwhelm the other. Exalted is Allah, far above what they say about Him"
  23,92,He knows the unseen and the manifest. And He is a lot loftier than those they associate with Him (as partners)
  23,93,"Say, \"My Lord, in case You let me be the witness to the torment they have been promised"
  23,94,"My Lord, do not let me be a part of the evil nation"
  23,95,We are indeed perfectly capable of letting you witness the punishment with which We have threatened them
  23,96,"(Oh messenger), rid the evil with that which is better! We are very well aware of what they utter"
  23,97,"And say, \"My Lord, I seek refuge with You against the evil promptings of the Shaitans"
  23,98,"And I seek refuge with You, my Lord, so that they may not even come close (to me)"
  23,99,"And when death comes to anyone of them, he will say, \"My Lord, send me back"
  23,100,"To the place I left behind! Perhaps, I will do good deeds (this time around).\" Definitely not! These are mere words he utters. A barrier behind the dead (preventing their return to this life) shall exist till the day of their resurrection"
  23,101,"Then, all links of kinship between them shall cease on that day. The day the trumpet sounds, they will not inquire about one another"
  23,102,Those whose scales (of good deeds) weigh heavier shall be successful
  23,103,"While the ones whose scales (of good deeds) weigh lighter have incurred for themselves a severe loss. In hell, they shall stay forever"
  23,104,"Fire will scorch their faces. There, they will be gloomy and grave"
