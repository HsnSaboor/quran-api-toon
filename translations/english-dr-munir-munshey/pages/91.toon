quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,80,The one who obeys the messenger has in fact obeyed Allah. We have not sent you as a warden over anyone who turns away
  4,81,"They say, \"We are obedient!\" But as they leave your presence, some of them (gather at night and) conspire to do just the opposite of what you said. Allah is recording their nightly cabals. So, let them be, and place your trust in Allah. Sufficient is Allah as a trustee"
  4,82,"Why don´t they ponder over the Qur´an? Had it been from a source other than Allah, they would have found a great deal of conflict (and contradiction) in it"
  4,83,"When they come upon a news that has a bearing upon (public) safety or hazard, they spread it around. (Instead), they should convey it to the messenger, or others in authority among them _ those with ability to draw the correct conclusion from it. If Allah had not bestowed His favors and His mercy upon you, then you would have _ barring a few among you _ done the bidding of Shaitan"
  4,84,"So, fight for the sake of Allah. You are accountable for none but yourself. But urge the believers (to fight). It might just be that (by your hand) Allah will curb (and curtail) the might of the disbelievers. Allah is Mightier and more Powerful! His torture is the most Severe"
  4,85,Whoever pleads (and intercedes for) a good cause shall get a share (of the reward) from it. Whoever (pleads and) intercedes for an evil cause shall bear the share of the burden (of sin). Allah maintains a strict vigil over everything
  4,86,"When someone welcomes you with a greeting, respond with an even better salute, or (at least) return the same greeting. Indeed, Allah will take into account every single thing"
