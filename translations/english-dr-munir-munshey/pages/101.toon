quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"There are some (hypocrites) who are waiting to see your fate. If victory comes to you from Allah, they will say to you, \"Were we not with you?\" However, if fate favored the unbelievers, they will say to them, \"Could we not have (fought against you and) overwhelmed you? Didn´t we keep the believers from (defeating) you?\" Allah will render his judgment between you (and them) on the Day of Judgment. Allah will never allow the unbelievers a way over the believers"
  4,142,"The hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but it is actually He Who dupes them. They are lethargic (and listless) when they stand for ´salat´ _ (they) only (wish) to be noticed by others (and just go through the motions of ´salat´). Little do they remember Allah"
  4,143,They waver and fluctuate. They are neither with this group nor with that. You will never find a way (out) for the one whom Allah leads astray
  4,144,"Oh you who believe! Do not pick the unbelievers instead of the believers, as your friends and allies. Do you want to place before Allah a clear proof of your guilt"
  4,145,"Indeed, the hypocrites shall occupy the lowest level of hell _ (its deepest abyss),. You will not find anyone who would (want to) be their helper"
  4,146,"But those of them who repent, make amends, hold on firmly to Allah, and devote their religion sincerely and exclusively for Allah are going to be with the believers. Soon, Allah will grant the believers an enormous reward"
  4,147,"If you believe and express gratitude, why would Allah want to punish you (for your past sins)? Indeed, Allah is ever so appreciative (of the grateful ones)! And He is the all-Knowing"
