quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,38,"And (also) for those who flaunt (and flash), when they spend their wealth, in order to show off to the people. They do not believe in Allah or the Day of Judgment. Whoever has Shaitan as an intimate companion has indeed an evil companion"
  4,39,"What harm could have come to them, if they had believed in Allah and the Last Day, and had spent a little out of the sustenance Allah had granted them? Allah is well-Aware of them"
  4,40,"Indeed, Allah will not wrong anyone _ not even worth the weight of an atom! (In fact) if there is a good deed, He doubles it. (In addition) He will award an immense reward, on His own"
  4,41,"(Just imagine) what will it be like (on the Day of Judgment)! Against each nation, We will call (Our messengers as) a witness. Against these people, (Oh prophet) We will call you as a witness"
  4,42,"That day, those who disbelieved and defied the messenger would wish that the earth was leveled flat over them. They would not be able to hide anything from Allah"
  4,43,"Oh you who believe! Do not come near ´salat´ if you are drunk, until you know what you utter. Nor if you are spiritually unclean (after a sexual contact) _ unless you are traveling _ until you (bathe and) clean yourself. If you are sick or traveling, or if any of you has been to the toilet, or if you have come in (sexual) contact with (your) women and you do not find water (to clean yourself), then perform ´Tayyamum´. Find a clean slab of soil and (after touching it) run your hand over your face and hands. Indeed, Allah is Lenient and Merciful"
  4,44,"Do you not look at those, who were given a portion of the scriptures? They use it to purchase misguidance! They want you to lose the right path, too"
