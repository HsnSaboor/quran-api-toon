  20,89,"Did they not see that it did not respond to them at all? Nor did it have the ability to hurt them, or help them"
  20,90,"Even though Haroon had told them earlier, \"Oh my people! You are being tested with it (the calf). Really, your Lord is the most Merciful. So follow me, all of you! And obey my command"
  20,91,"They said, \"We will not quit worshipping (the calf) until Musa comes back"

  20,95,"Said, \"And what about you, Oh Saamari"
  20,96,"(Saamari) said, \"I realized what others failed to. So I collected a handful (of dust) from the footmarks of the prophets and tossed it on the calf. That is what my self prompted me to do"
  20,97,"(Musa) said, \"Go! This is (the punishment) for you: in this life you will (continually) utter ´Do not touch me´, and you have an appointment (in the afterlife) which you cannot skip. Now watch that god of yours, upon whose worship you insisted. We will surely melt it down, then scatter it around in the ocean"
  20,98,"As a matter of fact, Allah (alone) is your God! Besides Him there is no other god, and His knowledge extends over all things"
