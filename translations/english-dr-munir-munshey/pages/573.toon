quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,"Indeed, some of us (have surrendered and) are obedient, while others have deviated (from the right path). In fact, those accepting Islam (as their way of life) are really the ones seeking the right path"
  72,15,Those who have deviated from the right path would serve as fuel (and firewood) for hell
  72,16,"Had they stood firm upon the way (of Islam), We would (surely) have supplied them with abundant (rain) water"
  72,17,"To test them with! The Lord will immerse into an ever worsening torment, all those who turn away from the remembrance of their Lord"
  72,18,"The masjids, (the mosques), are for (the worship of) Allah. So do not invoke others along with Allah"
  72,19,"When the servant of Allah, (Muhammad, SAW), rose to invoke Him, they (resisted and) almost stifled him with their crowds"
  72,20,"Say, \"I shall pray (only) to my Lord and I shall not associate anyone with Him"
  72,21,"Say, \"I really have no power to cause you any harm, nor (to make you follow) the right path"
  72,22,"Say, \"No one can protect me against Allah. If (I do) not (get an asylum with Him), I will not find a place of refuge (anywhere)"
  72,23,(My mission is nothing) except to convey the revelations of Allah _ His messages. The fire of hell is for the one who disobeys Allah and His messenger. (That one) will stay there for ever
  72,24,"(Let them wait) till they witness that which they have been promised. Very soon, they will find out whose supporters are weaker and fewer in numbers"
  72,25,"Say, \"I do not know if the promised punishment is (to occur in the) near (future), or if my Lord will set a distant date for it"
  72,26,(Allah is) the Knower of the unseen; He does not divulge His secrets to anyone
  72,27,"Except to whomever He chooses among His messengers. (When He reveals the unseen to a messenger), He appoints (angels as) observers in front of and behind him"
  72,28,In order to monitor how the Messenger conveys the message of his Lord. He (Allah) surrounds (with his Knowledge and Power) everything that exists around them. (He knows everything)! He has counted up every single thing
