quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,62,"Allah will be sufficient on your behalf, should they intend to deceive you (by the offer of peace). It is He Who strengthened you by providing His support, and by providing the believing followers"
  8,63,"It is He Who caused the hearts of the believers to bind together (with love). Had you spent all that exists on this earth, you could not have secured their hearts (with bonds of brotherhood). Yet Allah has brought their hearts together. Indeed, He is the most Powerful, the Wisest"
  8,64,"Oh prophet! Allah is enough for you, and for those of the believers who follow you"
  8,65,"Oh prophet! Urge the believers to fight (for His cause). If, among you there are twenty patient and steadfast men, they would triumph over two hundred. A hundred of you would overcome a thousand unbelievers, since they are a people who do not understand"
  8,66,"At present Allah has eased your burden. He knows that you (still) have weakness (within your ranks). For now if, among you there are a hundred steadfast and patient men, they would triumph over two hundred. By the will of Allah, a thousand of you would triumph over two thousand. Allah is certainly with those who are patient and enduring"
  8,67,"It is not (befitting) for the prophet to take prisoners (during the battle) until he had thoroughly crushed (the enemy) in the land. You desire the lure of this world, while Allah intends (to give you) the (eternal) life to come. Allah is the most Powerful, the Wisest"
  8,68,"Had it not been for the preordained decree of Allah, a severe torment would have struck you because of what you took"
  8,69,"So, (enjoy and) partake of the booty you took (in battle). It is lawful and wholesome for you. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is the most Forgiving, the most Merciful"
