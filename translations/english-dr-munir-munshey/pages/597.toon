quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,(I swear) by the fig and the olive
  95,2,And the mount Sinai
  95,3,And the tranquil land (of Makkah)
  95,4,We have certainly fashioned man in the finest possible form
  95,5,"Thereafter, We relegated him to being the lowest of the low"
  95,6,"Except for those who believe and perform the righteous deeds! For them, there is the unrestricted unending reward"
  95,7,"So (oh man), what makes you contradict (the truth about) the reward and punishment"
  95,8,Isn´t Allah absolutely the very Best of all the rulers
  96,1,"Read! In the name of your Lord, Who created (everything that exists)"
  96,2,He creates man from a clot (of blood)
  96,3,Read! Your Lord is the most Generous
  96,4,"He it is, Who imparted knowledge by the pen"
  96,5,Taught man what he did not know
  96,6,"No, of course not! Man is surely rebellious"
  96,7,"For, he thinks he is independent"
  96,8,(Even though his final) return is towards your Lord
  96,9,"Did you (oh Muhammad, SAW), see the one who forbids"
  96,10,The servant (of Allah) to perform ´salat´
  96,11,What do you think? Is he well guided
  96,12,And (does he) enjoin piety
  96,13,Or do you think he denied and turned away
  96,14,Does he not know that Allah watches (everything)
  96,15,"Of course not! If he did not desist, We will surely drag him by the hair on his forehead"
  96,16,The lying sinful lock of hair
  96,17,He may then call his henchmen for help
  96,18,"While, We shall summon the guardians of hell"
  96,19,"No! Beware! Do not follow such a one. (Rather), fall prostrate and draw closer (to Allah)"
