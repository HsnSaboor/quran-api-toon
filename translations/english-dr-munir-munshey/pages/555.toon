quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"When it is said to them, \"Come! The messenger of Allah will seek forgiveness for you\", they turn their heads away. You find them looking away in arrogance (and disdain)"
  63,6,It makes no difference whether you seek forgiveness for them or not. Allah will never forgive them. Indeed Allah never guides the nation of evildoers
  63,7,"They are the ones who say, \"Do not spend anything on the companions of Allah´s messenger. (Wait) till they desert him.\" (All) the treasures of the heavens and the earth belong to Allah. But the hypocrites do not understand"
  63,8,"They (the hypocrites) say, \"When we return to town, the one with respect and honor will expel the despised (and humbled).\" The respect and honor belong (entirely) to Allah, His messenger, and the believers. But the hypocrites do not know"
  63,9,Oh those of you who believe! Do not let your wealth and your children divert you away from the remembrance of Allah. Anyone doing that would indeed be the loser
  63,10,"Spend (in charity), out of what We have granted you, lest death comes to any of you and (remorsefully) he says, \"My Lord, if only you grant me an extension, (a little more time), I would give (my wealth in) charity; and I would be righteous"
  63,11,"Allah never extends (the life) for anyone, past his time. Allah is well Aware of what you do"
