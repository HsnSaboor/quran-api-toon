quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,21,"Those not anticipating a meeting with Us said, \"Why were angels not sent down for us? And why do we not see our God?\" They deem themselves too important, and have been arrogant a great deal"
  25,22,"One day, they will get to see the angels. But (the proceedings of) that day will not bring any good news for these criminals. The angels will say, \"For you the good news is absolutely forbidden"
  25,23,"We will bring out all the good deeds they have performed. Then, We will grind them into fine dust and blow the dust away"
  25,24,"That day, the people of paradise shall have exquisite residences and the most peaceful resting places"
  25,25,"That day, the sky and the clouds will split apart; and through it, angels shall descend in a continuous stream"
  25,26,"That day, the sole and genuine authority shall belong to Rehman. That day will be tough for the unbelievers"
  25,27,"That day, the evildoers will bite their hands in despair and say, \"Oh misery! If only I had gone along with the messenger"
  25,28,Alas! My misfortune! If only I had not taken that one _ (the Shaitan) _ as a friend
  25,29,"He really made me disregard the advice when it came to me.\" Indeed, the Shaitan always betrays man in times of need"
  25,30,"And the messenger will say, \"My Lord, truly my people had forsaken this Qur´an"
  25,31,"In this manner, We designated for every prophet an opponent from amongst the guilty. Your Lord suffices as a Guide and a Helper"
  25,32,"The unbelievers say, \"Why wasn´t this Qur´an revealed to him in a single stretch?\" This was done in order that We may fortify your heart with it. It is revealed gradually and phrased elegantly"
