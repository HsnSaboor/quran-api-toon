quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  43,23,"Prior to you, the same thing happened to every single town where We sent a warner. The leaders, those living in ease and affluence, said the same thing, \"We found our forefathers practicing a certain way (of life), and now we are emulating their example"
  43,24,"Every (prophet) asked, \"What if I bring you the guidance that is better than (the customs and rites) you found your forefathers observing (so rigidly)?\" They replied, \"We reject what (you claim) has been revealed to you"
  43,25,"We exacted revenge from them. So observe, how (horrible) was the outcome for those who rejected"
  43,26,"Remember, when Ibraheem said to his father and his people, \"I am really fed up (and freed from the blame) of what you (continue to) worship"
  43,27,"Other than the One Who created me, and He will guide me for sure"
  43,28,And Ibraheem bequeathed the enduring words (of truth) to posterity; perhaps they would repent (and return to Allah)
  43,29,"In fact, I let these people and their forefathers enjoy (the pleasures of) life. Now the truth (this Qur´an) has come to them, as well as the messenger explaining (everything) clearly"
  43,30,"When (the knowledge of) the absolute reality came to them, they said, \"This is magic, and surely we refuse to believe it"
  43,31,"They ask, \"Why is it that this Qur´an is not being revealed to one of the more prominent men of the two cities (Makkah And Taif)"
  43,32,Do they dispense the mercy of your Lord? We (alone) distribute among them the means of livelihood in the life of this world. We elevate the status of some of them over others. So that some of them may employ the services of others. (But) the blessings of your Lord are better than the wealth they amass
  43,33,"People might all turn into a single community (of disbelievers). Otherwise, We would have given all of them _ all those who refuse to believe in the most Merciful _ houses with the roofs made of silver, and silver stairway they could climb"
