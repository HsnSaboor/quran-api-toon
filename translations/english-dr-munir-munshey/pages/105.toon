quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,171,"Oh People of the book! Do not (overstate and) exaggerate your religious beliefs; do not say anything except the truth about Allah. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary was in fact (nothing more than) the messenger of Allah and His word which He cast upon Mary. (Jesus was) a soul created by Him. So, believe in Allah and His messenger. Do not say (that Allah is) three! Desist! It is better for you (if you desist). Verily, Allah is (only) One. He is (too glorified and) too exalted to have a son. Everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to Him. Allah suffices as a Disposer of all matters and things! (He needs no mediator)"
  4,172,"Never was (Jesus) the Messiah, too arrogant to be treated as the created servant of Allah, nor are the angels who are the closest (to Allah). He will soon summon to Himself all those who scornfully avoid worshipping Him"
  4,173,"Allah will award to the fullest extent the due rewards to those who believe and do the righteous deeds; and (then) by His grace, He will grant them even more (of His bounties). He will inflict a painful punishment upon (all) those who acted arrogantly and refrained from worshipping Him. Other than Allah, they will not find a friend or anyone to help"
  4,174,Oh mankind! (This Qur´an) _ the (incontrovertible) proof has come to you from your Lord. We have revealed to you (the beacon) _ the manifest light
  4,175,"Soon, He will admit into His mercy and His grace (all) those who believe in Him and hold fast on to Him. He will guide them towards Himself, _ (towards) the straight path"
