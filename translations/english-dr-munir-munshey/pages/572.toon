quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  72,1,"Say, \"It has been revealed to me that a (small) group of jinn heard (the Quran) and reported (it to its nation), ´We just heard a wonderful recital.´"
  72,2,"It guides towards the right path. We believe in it, and we shall (now) never associate anyone with our Lord"
  72,3,"Indeed, He _ Exalted and Majestic as He is _ did not (ever) take a mate or a son"
  72,4,"The foolish among us, used to utter atrocious lies about Allah"
  72,5,We thought (and wrongly assumed) that human beings and jinn could not utter false statements about Allah
  72,6,Some of the human beings used to invoke the support (and protection) of some (individuals among the jinn). (But) the jinn merely increased the (confusion and) disbelief of man
  72,7,And people thought _ as you did _ that Allah will not resurrect anyone
  72,8,We scanned (and surveyed) the sky and found it teaming with watchful guards and flaming meteors
  72,9,"Indeed, we used to seek places (in the sky) to sit and eavesdrop (on the angels). But now whoever attempts to eavesdrop finds a flaming meteor lurking around (to strike him)"
  72,10,"Of course, we did not know whether a (cosmic) calamity has been planned for those on earth, or that their Lord intends to reveal to them the right path"
  72,11,"Among us (jinn), there are some that are righteous, and others that are quite the opposite. We follow diverse (and divergent) paths"
  72,12,We have come to realize that we will never (be able to) evade Allah on earth. Nor can we ever evade Him if we run away (and leave the earth)
  72,13,"In fact, when we heard the guidance, we believed it. Thus, whoever believes in his Lord never needs to worry about his (good) deeds losing their worth. Nor shall he ever fear an injustice"
