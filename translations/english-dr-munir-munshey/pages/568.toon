quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,"Today, he has no friends here"
  69,36,"And to eat, he only has the filthy discharge from wounds"
  69,37,Which no one except the sinners have to eat
  69,38,No! Absolutely not! I swear by all that you see
  69,39,As well as that which you do not
  69,40,"It, (the Qur´an), is the word of the noble messenger"
  69,41,(Certainly)! it is not the word of a poet. Little do you believe
  69,42,Nor is it the word of a fortuneteller. Seldom do you ponder
  69,43,It is the revelation from the Lord of the universe
  69,44,Had he (the prophet) purported (and fabricated) lies about Us
  69,45,We would have seized him by his right hand
  69,46,And would have cut off his main vein
  69,47,(Absolutely) no one among you could have kept Us away from him
  69,48,It is certainly a reminder for the righteous
  69,49,"Of course We know, that among you are those who disbelieve"
  69,50,"Thus, this Qur´an will definitely be the source of anguish for the disbelievers"
  69,51,It is the veritable truth _ (a statement of absolute certainty)
  69,52,"So glorify the name of the Almighty, your Lord"
  70,1,The skeptics ask about the torment that is bound to land
  70,2,Upon the unbelievers! Nothing can ward it off
  70,3,"(It is) from Allah, the Lord of the means of ascent (to the heavens)"
  70,4,The angels and the spirits rise up towards Him during a day that spans fifty thousand years
  70,5,So endure (all adversity) with grace and patience
  70,6,"Indeed, they consider the punishment to be far in the future"
  70,7,While We see it close at hand
  70,8,"The sky that day, will be like molten copper"
  70,9,And the mountains like the fluffy tufts of wool
  70,10,Even the closest friends would fail to inquire about (the welfare of) their close friends
