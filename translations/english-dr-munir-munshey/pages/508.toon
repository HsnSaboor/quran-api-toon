quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  47,12,"Indeed, Allah will let those who believe, and perform good deeds, enter paradise; rivers run right through it! And fire shall be the abode of those who disbelieve. In this life, they eat and live out their existence like cattle"
  47,13,"Many a town, stronger than yours that has expelled you, have We destroyed! Then they found no helpers for themselves"
  47,14,Can (the fate of) one following clear instructions of his Lord be similar to the one who follows his own whims and wishes? Their evil deeds have been made to appear good to them
  47,15,"The paradise that the pious are being promised contains rivers of water without a stink, milk the taste of which undergoes no change, wine that tastes sumptuous, and strained honey. In it, they shall have every kind of fruit! And forgiveness from their Lord! Could he (in paradise) be compared to the one who shall be in fire till eternity, and shall be served scalding hot water which will split open his intestines"
  47,16,"Among them are those who come to hear you. But after leaving, they ask those who know, \"What did he say just now?\" Allah has stamped their hearts! They follow their whims and wishes"
  47,17,Allah increases in guidance those who accept His advice. He awards them piety
  47,18,So what are they still waiting for? The hour (of Judgment)? It shall come upon them suddenly and surreptitiously. Its signs have already appeared! Where would they get their guidance once the hour has arrived
  47,19,"Know it! For sure, there is no god but Allah! Seek forgiveness for your sins as well as the sins of the believing men and the believing women. Allah is Aware of their movement on earth, and their places of residence"
