  21,36,"When the unbelievers see you, they treat you with scorn, (saying), \"Is he the one who speaks (ill) of our gods?\" While they themselves are such a sort that they refuse to accept any mention of Rehman"
  21,37,"Man is created hasty. Very soon, I will have you see My signs! Do not be in such haste"
  21,38,"And they say, \"If you are truthful, tell us. When will that promise (of the afterlife) come about"
  21,39,If the unbelievers could only imagine the moment when they will struggle in vain to ward off the fire from their faces and their backs! They shall have no help
  21,40,"It will come upon them all of a sudden, and it will bewilder them. They will be unable to turn it away, and they shall have no respite (another chance)"
  21,41,"During earlier times, too, they made fun of the messengers. But the mockery came back to haunt (and surround) those who used to mock"
  21,42,"Say, \"Who will watch over you during the night and the day, and protect you against (the wrath of) Rehman?\" No! In fact, they turn away from the remembrance of their Lord"
  21,43,Or do they have other gods to guard them against Us? Those ´gods´ are unable to help even their own selves. Nor can they be guarded against Us
  21,44,"Rather, We had them and their forefathers enjoy (life) till they grew old. Do they not notice? We keep on shrinking the land from all sides. So then, can they triumph"
