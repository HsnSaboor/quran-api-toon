quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,10,"The wealth, and the children of the unbelievers, will not help them a bit against Allah; and they will become the fuel for the fire"
  3,11,"Like the people of the pharaoh and those before them! They rejected Our signs, so Allah seized them for their sins. Allah is very strict and severe in retribution"
  3,12,"Say to those who denied, \"Soon you would be overcome, and gathered in hell. It is the worst of the abode"
  3,13,"You already had a sign in the two armies that met (in the battle of ´Badar´). One army fought for the sake of Allah, while the other was the unbeliever! The believers saw with their eyes that the unbelievers were twice their own numbers. Thus, Allah strengthens with His help whomever He pleases. In that is surely a lesson for those with insight"
  3,14,"The love and passion for (certain) things _ women, offspring, treasures of gold and silver, branded (high bred) horses, cattle, and land _ have been made tempting and alluring for mankind. (However), this is only a brief enjoyment of the life of this world. That which is with Allah, is actually the most excellent abode"
  3,15,"Say, \"Shall I tell you about something (far) better than that? For the righteous ones, there exists with their Lord the gardens of paradise, through which run the rivers. There, the believers shall have eternal abodes, immaculate mates, and the acceptance and approval of Allah. And Allah (vigilantly) watches over His created servants"
