quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  38,62,"They will say, \"What is the matter? We don´t see here (in hell) those men we used to consider wicked (in the previous life)"
  38,63,We had made them the target of ridicule! Why do our eyes fail to spot them (here)
  38,64,Definitely! That is the truth! Those in hellfire will bicker and wrangle (just like that)
  38,65,"Say (oh prophet)! \"Actually, I am only a warner! There is no god but Allah, the One and Only, the Almighty"
  38,66,"The Sustainer of the heavens and the earth and everything in between, the most Powerful and the most Forgiving"
  38,67,"Say, \"That is the greatest news"
  38,68,You are turning away from it
  38,69,"I had no knowledge of the high chiefs, (the angels), as they discussed among themselves (the creation of Adam)"
  38,70,This was revealed to me (for no other reason) except that I am really _ and clearly _ a warner
  38,71,"Your Lord said to the angels, \"I am really going to create man from clay"
  38,72,"You must fall down prostrate before him (in submission), after I have fashioned him and have breathed into him the spirit created by Me"
  38,73,"Accordingly, the angels _ all of them together _ fell prostrate"
  38,74,"But Iblees (the Shaitan) did not! He displayed arrogance, and was (always) a disbeliever"
  38,75,"(Allah) said, \"Oh Iblees, what kept you from falling prostrate before a being I created with My hands? Are you too proud (to bow)? Or are you one of the high and the exalted"
  38,76,"(Iblees) said, \"I am better than him. You created me from fire, while You created him from clay"
  38,77,"(Allah) said, \"Get out of here! Indeed, you are damned"
  38,78,You shall carry My curse till the day of resurrection
  38,79,"(Iblees) said, \"My Lord, give me a chance (to prove my point) till the day they shall be raised (back to life)"
  38,80,"(Allah) said, \"You are (hereby) being granted the respite"
  38,81,Till the day of that appointed time
  38,82,"(Iblees) said, \"I swear by Your Might, (oh Lord)! I will definitely tempt and lead all of them astray"
  38,83,Except those among them that are Your true and sincere servants
