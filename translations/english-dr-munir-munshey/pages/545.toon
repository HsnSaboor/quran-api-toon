quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  58,22,"You will never see it happen, that folks who believe in Allah and the Day of Judgment (also) love those who oppose Allah and His messenger, even if they happen to be their fathers, sons, brothers or other relatives. Such are the believers upon whose hearts Allah has etched faith; He has bolstered their belief with His true guidance and light. He will usher them into paradise, right through which, run rivers. They will live there forever! Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of Allah! Beware, it is (really) the party of Allah that will triumph"
  59,1,Everything in the heavens and the earth chants the praises of Allah! He is the most Powerful and the Wisest
  59,2,"It is He Who drove the disbelievers, the people of the book, from their homes at the very start of assembly (the siege against them). You never thought they would depart (without resistance). And they thought their strongholds would defend them against Allah. But Allah came upon them from where they least expected. He cast terror in their hearts, so they ruined their homes with their own hands, and the hands of the believers. So learn the lesson, Oh you, endowed with sights"
  59,3,"Had Allah not decreed (the life of) exile for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world. The punishment by fire is (in store) for them in the afterlife"
