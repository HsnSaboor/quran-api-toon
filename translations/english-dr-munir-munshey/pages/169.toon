quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,150,"Musa was angry and sad when he returned to his nation. He said, \"How (awful and) evil was what you did behind my back! Did you rush towards your Lord´s Judgment?\" He dropped the (inscribed) tablets and grabbed his brother by the lock of hair on his head and pulled him closer. His brother said, \"Oh son of my mother! In fact, the nation considered me weak and vulnerable. They (overwhelmed me and) almost killed me. Do not give the enemy a chance to gloat over my fate. Do not count me among the evildoing folk"
  7,151,"Musa prayed, \"My Lord, forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your Grace. You are absolutely the most Merciful of those who show mercy"
  7,152,"The wrath of their Lord, and a disgrace in the life of this world would soon land upon those who chose (to worship) the calf. This is how We punish those who invent falsehood"
  7,153,"Those who commit evil deeds but repent afterward (would find that) even then your Lord is the most Forgiving, the most Merciful"
  7,154,"As Musa´s wrath subsided, he picked up the tablets. Their inscriptions contained guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord"
  7,155,"Musa selected seventy men for an appointment with Us. There, a violent earthquake seized them. He prayed, \"Oh my Lord, had You so willed You could have destroyed them _ and me _ earlier. Would You destroy us because of the actions of a few foolish ones amongst us. This was only a trial from You. By that, You lead astray whom You want, and You guide whom You want. You (alone) are our patron! Forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are the very Best of all those who forgive"
