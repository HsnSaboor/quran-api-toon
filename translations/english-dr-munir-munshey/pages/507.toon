quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"Those who disbelieve and obstruct others from the way of Allah, have really squandered their good deeds"
  47,2,"Allah will straighten the affairs of those who believe, perform good deeds, and believe in what is revealed to Mohammed (SAW). That which is revealed, is the truth from their Lord. He will rinse their faults clean"
  47,3,"That is because the disbelievers follow falsehood, whereas the believers follow the truth from their Lord! Thus Allah cites their examples for the people"
  47,4,"So, when you clash with the disbelievers (in battle) slay them! If you over power them, take them prisoners and secure them well. Later when the weapons are laid down, either release them on ransom, or graciously on their own (as a favor). Allah could have exacted revenge, had He wanted; But He wants to test some of you by certain others among you. Allah will never waste the deeds of those who are slain in the way of Allah"
  47,5,He will soon guide them and set their affairs right
  47,6,He will usher them into paradise; He has already familiarized them with it
  47,7,"Oh you who believe! If you help Allah, He will support you and establish you firmly in the land"
  47,8,"And those who disbelieve Allah, fell flat on their faces! He lets their actions go astray"
  47,9,"They dislike that which Allah has revealed! Therefore, He lets their deeds lose all their worth"
  47,10,Have they not moved about in the land? Do they not observe the ultimate fate of those before them? Allah annihilated them! A similar fate awaits those who do not believe
  47,11,"Because the believers have Allah as their Patron, while the unbelievers have no patron"
