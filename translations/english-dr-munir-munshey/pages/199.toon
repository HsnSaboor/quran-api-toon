quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,73,"Oh prophet, wage an utmost struggle against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be harsh with them. Hell fire is their abode, and it is the worst of the destinations"
  9,74,"The hypocrites swear by Allah that they have said nothing (wrong); but surely they did utter the words of disbelief. After accepting Islam they have disbelieved! They attempted to do what they could not carry out. How hostile (and resentful) are they, simply because Allah, by His grace and through His messenger, enriched them! It would be to their advantage if they repented. However, if they turn away, Allah will torment them with a painful punishment in this world, as well as in the life-to-come. They do not have any friends or helpers in this world"
  9,75,"There are those of them who pledged to Allah, (saying), \"If He (ever) bestows His bounties upon us, we would most certainly spend in charity and be among the righteous"
  9,76,"But when He bestowed His bounties upon them, they were stingy (and they withheld their wealth). Abandoning (their oaths), they went back (on their words)"
  9,77,"Consequently, He planted hypocrisy in their heart right till they meet Him. (This is) because they went back on their promise with Allah, and because they used to lie"
  9,78,"Do they not know that Allah is well Aware of their intrigues and their secret conferences? Of course, Allah is all-Knower of the unknown and the unseen"
  9,79,"The hypocrites criticize the (true) believers who give charity willingly and beyond the call of duty, as well as those who find nothing (to give) except their own (physical) efforts (and struggles). They make fun of the believers. But Allah makes fun of the hypocrites. For them, there exists a painful punishment"
