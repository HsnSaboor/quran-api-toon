quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,48,"They had sought to foment dissension and discord on an earlier occasion, too. They turned matters upside down to defeat you. But despite their hatred, the truth (victory) arrived and Allah´s decree became manifest"
  9,49,"Among them are some who say, \"Grant me leave. Do not put me through a test.\" Beware! A trial it is, intowhich they have (just) stumbled. Of course, the hellfire surrounds the unbelievers"
  9,50,"It bothers them if something good comes your way. But if a disaster strikes you they say, \"Good thing, we took precaution beforehand.\" And happily they turn away"
  9,51,"Say, \"Nothing will ever happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us. He is our (Patron and) Protector. The believers should place their trust (only) in Allah"
  9,52,"Say, \"In our case, what you await is (nothing except) one of the two wonderful gains _ (victory or martyrdom). And in your case, what we are waiting for, is whether Allah will punish you Himself, or by our hands. (So wait on) we (too) are waiting with you"
  9,53,"Say, \"What you contribute _ willingly or unwillingly _ would not be accepted. Indeed, you have (always) been an evil (sinful) nation"
  9,54,What prevented their contributions from being accepted is the fact that they did not believe in Allah and His messenger. When they come to offer ´salat´ they are (always) neglectful and indolent. When they spend (for the sake of Allah) they do so with resentment
