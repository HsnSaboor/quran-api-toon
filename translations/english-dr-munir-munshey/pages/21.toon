quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,135,"They say, \"Become the Jews, or become the Christians, and (only then) you will be guided.\" (Oh prophet), tell them, \"(We would) rather follow the creed of Ibraheem, who was the exclusive devotee (of Allah). He was not among those who set up others as equal to Allah"
  2,136,"(Oh believers)! say, \"We believe in Allah and the revelation sent to us, as well as the revelation sent towards Ibraheem, Ismail, Ishaque, Yaqub and the tribes. (We believe in) that which was given to Musa and Jesus, and (also) that which was given to (other) prophets by their Lord. We do not discriminate against any of them. To Him, we have surrendered completely"
  2,137,"They are rightly guided, if their belief is identical to that of yours. But, if they turn away, then of course, they are (opposed to it and) in dissension. On your behalf, Allah will be sufficient against them. He hears-all and knows-all"
  2,138,(Imbue) the hue (and the halo) of Allah! What better shade of color to acquire than that of Allah? We are His sincere devotees
  2,139,"(Tell them), \"Are you going to argue with us concerning Allah? He is our Lord, and your Lord! We have our deeds, and you have yours to account for. We have devoted ourselves (exclusively) to Him"
  2,140,"Or do you claim that Ibraheem, Ismail, Ishaque, and the tribes were Jews? Or were they Christians? Say, \"Do you know better, or does Allah? Can anyone be more unjust and evil than he who hides from Allah the proof (which happens to be) in his possession? Allah is not unaware of anything you do"
  2,141,"That generation has now passed. For them, is what they earned. Yours shall (only) be what you will earn. You will not be asked about what they used to do"
