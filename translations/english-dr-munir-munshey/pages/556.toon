quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  64,1,Everything in the heavens and on earth chants the praises of Allah. To him belongs the empire! To him belongs all praise (and all gratitude)! He has power over all things
  64,2,"It is He Who created you. (Yet), among you are those who deny (the truth); and some of you believe. Allah watches everything you do"
  64,3,"He created the heavens and the earth (based) on the truth. He gave you form, the most excellent (the best possible) form; and towards Him is your journey back"
  64,4,"He knows everything in the heavens and on earth. He knows what you conceal, and what you declare. He has full knowledge of everything _ (all the emotions, intentions and thoughts) _ that exists in the hearts"
  64,5,"Have you not heard the tales of those who denied earlier? They tasted the evil consequences of their conduct. There is, (in addition), a painful punishment (in store) for them"
  64,6,"Allah´s messengers came to them with clear proofs. Yet, they (denied and) said, \"Will (fallible) humans guide us now?\" They rejected and turned away. Allah (in His Own right) is Free from all needs, and is Worthy of all praise"
  64,7,"The unbelievers claim they will never be brought back to life (for reckoning). Say, \"Of course you will! My Lord will definitely raise you (back to life). Then, He will certainly tell you what you had done. That is (really) easy for Allah to do"
  64,8,"Therefore, believe in Allah and His messenger; and the light (of revelation) which We have sent down. Allah is well Aware of what you do"
  64,9,"The day of gathering _ that day when He will gather all of you together _ will be the day of loss and gain, (the day of reparation and redress of wrongful deeds). He (Allah) will remove (and cleanse) the shortcomings (and sins) of the one who believes in Allah, and does righteous acts. He will admit such a person into paradise to live forever; rivers run right through it. That is the greatest success"
