quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  45,14,"(Oh prophet), tell those who believe, \"The unbelievers do not expect the ´days of Allah´ _(the Day of Resurrection and all days after that). Overlook them, so He may compensate people in accordance with the deeds they earn"
  45,15,"The one doing the righteous deeds, as also the one committing evil deeds, does so for his own sake. Then, towards your Lord you shall (all) return"
  45,16,"We had certainly given the book, the wisdom and the prophethood to the children of Israel. We blessed them with the wholesome provisions (of life). We had given them precedence over the whole world"
  45,17,"And We gave them clear instructions about every matter. It was only after (real) knowledge had come to them, that they indulged in internecine rivalry. It was (not out of ignorance but) with intent to wrong each other. Indeed, on the Day of Judgment your Lord will settle all matters of dispute between them"
  45,18,"Then, We prescribed for you a clear way (of life) concerning (the rules and rites of) religion. So follow that, and do not give in to the whims of those who do not know"

  45,21,"Do they think that We would treat the unbelievers committing evil deeds, in just the same manner as We treat the believers performing the righteous deeds? Should their lives and their deaths be equal? How wrong is their judgment"
  45,22,"Allah created the heavens and the earth with justice. So that every being may receive compensation, commensurate with what it earns (in this life). No one shall be wronged"
