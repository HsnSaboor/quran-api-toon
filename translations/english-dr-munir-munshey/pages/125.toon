quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,104,"When they are told, \"Come to what Allah has revealed, come to the prophet\" they say, \"Whatever we found our forefathers doing is good enough for us.\" Even though their forefathers knew nothing at all, nor were they guided"
  5,105,"Oh you who believe! You are liable for your own selves. Those who go astray cannot harm you a bit, provided you follow the guidance. Towards Allah is the ultimate return for all of you. Then, He will tell you everything you used to do"
  5,106,"Oh you who believe! If you find death close at hand, and you want to make out your last will, appoint as witnesses, two just men among you _ or among other people, should the calamity strike while you happen to be traveling. If you are in doubt (about the witnesses) detain them after ´salat´ and let them swear by Allah saying, \"We will not trade our testimony for worldly gain, nor will we hide the testimony of Allah. Else we would be the sinners"
  5,107,"Later, if it comes to light that the two witnesses merit (the suspicion of) sin, then let two others from among the rightful heirs (of the deceased) take the place of the earlier witnesses. Let them swear by Allah (saying), \"Our testimony is truer and more valid than their testimony, and we do not stray beyond the bounds (of truth). Else, we would be the evil doers"
  5,108,"That way, it is more likely that they will bear witness (properly and truthfully) as they should. They will fear that sworn testimony of others might contradict their own sworn testimony. Fear Allah and listen (carefully)! Allah does not guide the evil disobedient nation"
