quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,25,"Give the good news to those who believe and do the righteous deeds. Theirs shall be the gardens (of paradise) through which run the rivers. There, as they taste the fruits (of paradise), they would remark, \"This, we were given before, too (in the world)\". There, they would certainly be granted the identical (blessings). There, they shall have pure and immaculate mates. And there, they shall live forever"
  2,26,"Of course, Allah is not ashamed to quote and narrate the parable of a gnat, or anything smaller. Those who believe know that it certainly is the truth from their Lord. But those who disbelieve, say, \"What does Allah mean by this parable?\" Thereby, He causes many to stray, and leads many others to the right path! By that, He misleads only the sinful rebellious ones"
  2,27,"Those who, after having affirmed solemnly, break their covenant with Allah; those who (violate and) sever that which Allah has deemed inviolable, and has ordered to be joined. They cause chaos in the world. Such ones are the losers"
  2,28,"How can you not believe in Allah? You were (once) lifeless and He gave you life. Then, He will give you death, and then He will bring you back to life. Then, you shall return to Him"
  2,29,"He it is, Who created for you every single thing that exists on earth. Then, He turned to the heavens. He evened and fashioned them into seven heavens. He is fully aware of every single thing"
