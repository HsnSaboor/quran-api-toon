quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  39,6,"He created you (all) from a single being. Out of it, He created its spouse. He gave you eight types (four pairs: males and females of each) of domestic animals _ (sheep, goats, cows and camels). He created you in your mothers´ wombs, shaping you from one form to another _ through three (distinct kinds of) darkened zones. Such is Allah, your Lord! His is the empire (of the entire universe)! There is no god except He! How dare you turn away"
  39,7,"If you disbelieve (remember), Allah does not stand in need of you. (But) if you express gratitude, He is pleased with you. No one will carry the burden (of sin) for anybody else. Then, (carrying the load of your own sins) you must journey back to your Lord. He will tell you what you used to do. Indeed, He knows even that which lies (buried) in the chest"
  39,8,"When distress befalls man, he calls his Lord in repentance. But he forgets when his Lord (responds and) bestows His blessings _ forgets that he had ever called his Lord. To stray from the (straight) path (and to make others stray from it), he assigns partners for Allah. (Oh Muhammad, SAW) say, \"(Stay) in your denial (and) enjoy for a while. You will certainly end up in hell"
  39,9,"Could the one who is obedient (ever go to hell)? The one who prostrates before Allah and stands (in prayers) during all of hours of the night? The one who dreads the afterlife and hopes for the mercy of his Lord? Ask (them), \"Can those who know, be equal to the ones who do not?\" In fact, only the sensible ones heed (the advice)"
  39,10,"Say, \"Fear your Lord, oh servants (of Allah) who believe! The favorable outcome is for those who perform good deeds in this life. Allah´s land is spacious. Those who endure patiently would, in fact, be (compensated well and) rewarded in full without any reckoning"
