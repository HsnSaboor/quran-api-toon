quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,84,"Say, \"We believe in Allah and in that which was revealed to us, as well as that which was revealed to Ibraheem, Ismail, Ishaque, and Yaqub and the tribes. (We believe in) that which was conferred by their Lord upon Musa, Jesus and the (other) prophets. We do not make any distinction among them. We have submitted to Him"
  3,85,"If anyone desires (or adopts a way of life) other than Islam, it will never be accepted. In the life-to-come, he will be among the losers"
  3,86,"How would Allah guide the people who deny (the truth) after having professed belief at first, after they testified that the messenger is true, and after clear proof had come to them? Allah does not guide the nation of evil doers"
  3,87,"The befitting recompense for such people is that the curse of Allah, as well as the curse of His messenger and all mankind, should be upon them"
  3,88,"They shall live in that state forever. Never will their suffering ease, nor shall they ever have a (moment of) a respite"
  3,89,"Except those who (regret and) repent afterwards, and mend their ways. (If they do) then indeed, Allah is the most Forgiving, and the most Merciful"
  3,90,"Of course, the repentance will never be accepted from those who, having believed (at first), disbelieve, and then increase (and grow stubborn) in denial. Such ones have (truly) gone astray"
  3,91,"Indeed, not even an earth-full of gold, if offered as ransom, would be accepted from those who disbelieve and die as disbelievers. For such ones, there exists a painful punishment. They shall not have any helpers"
