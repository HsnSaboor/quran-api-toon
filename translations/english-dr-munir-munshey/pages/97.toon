quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"Most of the secret counsels contain nothing good or wholesome, unless it is for (the purpose of) encouraging charity and righteous deeds, or for affecting peace and reconciliation among people. If someone does that, seeking the pleasure of Allah, then We will soon grant him an enormous reward"
  4,115,"After the guidance has been revealed and explained, if anyone parts his way with the messenger and follows a path different from that of the believers, then We will divert him along his (chosen) path. We will hurl him in the hell (in the hereafter). What a despicable destination"
  4,116,"Indeed, Allah does not (ever) forgive ´shirk´ _ (the sin of associating partners with Him) _ anything else He will forgive for whomever He wills. He, who commits ´shirk´ has in fact lost his way, and has gone far astray"
  4,117,"That which they invoke instead of Him, are (just some) false female idols. In fact, they do not call anyone but Shaitan, the wretched rebel against Allah"
  4,118,"Allah cursed (Shaitan), and (in response) he said, \"I will lure away a large number of Your servants (as my followers)"
  4,119,"I will definitely mislead them. I will certainly stir up vain and wanton desires in them. I will command them and they will split the ears of the cattle _ (a common practice of the idol worshippers). I will persuade them, and they will change and corrupt the nature (of the order) of things that Allah has created.\" Whoever takes Shaitan as his master instead of Allah, has indeed incurred a severe and significant loss"
  4,120,"Shaitan holds out false promises to his followers, and arouses in them the wanton and vain desires. The promise of Shaitan is nothing but chicanery _ a deception"
  4,121,Hell is the abode for all such people. They will find no way to escape from it
