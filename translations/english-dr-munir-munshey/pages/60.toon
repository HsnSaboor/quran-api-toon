quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,78,"Some of them twist their tongues and distort (the text as they quote) the scriptures. You would think it was part of the scriptures, although it is not in the scriptures (at all). They claim that it is from Allah, when (in fact) it is not (the revelation) from Allah. Knowingly, they utter lies about Allah"
  3,79,"It is not (conceivable) that a man, upon whom Allah confers the book, the wisdom, and the prophethood, would later say to people, \"Be my devotees (and worship me) instead of Allah!\" Rather (he would say), \"Be the faithful servants of Allah, since you teach the scriptures and study them"
  3,80,"He could never ask you to take the angels and (other) prophets as your Lords. Could he order you to deny the truth, even though you had already surrendered (to Allah)"
  3,81,"When Allah made a covenant with the prophets, He said, \"I have certainly given you the book and the wisdom. Later, a messenger will come to you confirming (the truth) that you already possess. You must believe him, and you must help him.\" (Allah) said (to the prophets, and their followers), \"Do you agree (to do that), and will you accept (this condition of) My covenant?\" They said, \"We agree.\" (Allah) said, \"Be witness (to that, and bear that in mind). I am (also there) with you as a witness"
  3,82,So those who turned away after that are really the (rebellious and) disobedient miscreants
  3,83,"Do they seek (a way of life) other than the religion of Allah although, willing or not, everyone (and everything) in the heavens and on earth submits to Him? Towards Him, they shall all be made to return"
