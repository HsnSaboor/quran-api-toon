quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,Allah has rendered the hearts (of some of His servants) receptive for Islam. They follow the illumilating guidance of their Lord. Can they be like the unbelievers? Misery is for those whose hearts harden up even more by the mention of Allah. They indeed are clearly on the wrong path
  39,23,"Allah has revealed the very best of the narrative. The oft-repeated contents of this book are coherent, consistent and coupled _ (the promise of rewards is coupled with the threat of punishment). Those who fear their Lord are awestruck by it. Their flesh shudders with fright, and their hearts and souls become mellow with the remembrance of Allah. Such is the guidance of Allah! He guides whomever He wants! There is no guide for the one whom Allah leads astray"
  39,24,"So, (imagine the plight of) the one who will _ (being helpless) on the Day of Judgment _ bear the punishment right smack on his face. The evildoers would be told, \"Here, taste what you have wrought upon yourself"
  39,25,"The earlier people had rejected. As a result, punishment came to them from where they least expected"
  39,26,"Thus, Allah had them taste the shame of disgrace in the life of this world, and of course the punishment of the afterlife is much worse. If only they had realized"
  39,27,"Indeed, We have placed in this Qur´an various kinds of examples before the people. Perhaps, they will reflect"
  39,28,"The Qur´an is in Arabic; (it is simple), without any distortion or deviation. Perhaps they will fear Him"
  39,29,"Allah quotes an example. (There are two slaves), one belongs to many partners pitted against each other, while the other belongs entirely to one master. Can these two men fare equally? All praise is for Allah! But most people do not realize"
  39,30,"(Oh prophet)! Of course you will die! And for sure, they will die too"
  39,31,"Then, on the Day of Judgment you all would place your disputes before your Lord"
