quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,It is inappropriate and unbecoming of a believer _ man or woman _ to expect a choice in any matter which has already been decided and settled by Allah and His messenger. Anyone who disbelieves Allah and His messenger is clearly misguided; he has strayed far away
  33,37,"And recall that man (Zayd)? Allah had done favors upon him, and you had too. You were saying to him, \"Fear Allah, keep your wife and do not divorce her.\" Allah was going to bring out into the open that which you kept hidden in your heart at that time. You were afraid of people, although that is Allah´s right! You should fear Him only! When Zayd had completed his object (of divorcing his wife), We married her to you. (We did that) so the believers may have no restriction in (and may have no stigma attached to) marrying the former wives of their adopted sons, provided the adopted sons had already divorced their wives. The commands of Allah must be fulfilled"
  33,38,"No restriction stands in the way of the prophet. Nothing restrains him from carrying out the orders of Allah. This happens to be the established practice of Allah in the case of all the messengers who had gone by earlier. And Allah´s command is destiny, irrevocable and predominant"
  33,39,"(This is true for) those who carry the message of Allah, fear Him and are not afraid of anyone except Allah. Allah is sufficient to hold the reckoning"
  33,40,"Muhammad (SAW), is not the father of any man among you, but he is the messenger of Allah and the last of the prophets. Allah is very well Aware of all things"
  33,41,Oh you who believe! Remember Allah! Remember Him often
  33,42,Glorify and chant His praises every morning and afternoon
  33,43,"It is He Who bestows His blessings upon you. His angels pray for you, that He may bring you out of darkness into light. He is very Kind and Benevolent towards the believers"
