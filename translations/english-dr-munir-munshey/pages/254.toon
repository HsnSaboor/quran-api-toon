quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  13,35,"The paradise being promised to the righteous has rivers flowing right through it. Its food and shades are eternal! Such is the reward for the righteous, and the retribution for the unbelievers is fire"
  13,36,"The people of the book are pleased about what is revealed to you. However, groups of them dispute portions of it. Say, \"My orders are to worship Allah exclusively, and not join partners with Him. Towards Him I call you, and towards Him is my return journey"
  13,37,"Thus, We have sent down this order in Arabic. After this revelation, if you allow any adjustment for their whims, you will find no rescuers or protectors against Allah"
  13,38,"Indeed, prior to you We sent messengers who also had wives and children. No messenger can perform miracles of his own accord _ without the will of Allah. Each age has its own preordained destiny"
  13,39,"Allah abolishes, and confirms, what He wants! He has the real authority"
  13,40,"You (oh Mohammed, SAW) may witness how We punish them, or We may let you die first. Either way, conveying the message is your obligation, calling them to account is Ours"
  13,41,Have they not observed? We are consistently shrinking the land from all sides. Allah´s is the final command. There is no overseer above Him and His reckoning is swift
  13,42,The nations before them tried to be cunning. Ingenuity of all sorts belongs to Allah! He knows exactly the deed each soul has gathered. The unbelievers will soon realize who triumphs in the final outcome
