  30,48,"It is Allah Who sends the winds, which raise the clouds. He then spreads them in the sky, as He wants.

  30,50,"So look at the effects of (the mercy of) Allah. (Look at) how He grants new life to the land after its death. Undoubtedly, He will bring the dead back to life. He is capable of accomplishing everything"
