quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,116,"As for those who continue to reject (the truth), their riches and their offspring would not help them a bit against Allah. They are the inmates of fire, and shall remain there forever"
  3,117,"What they spend during the life of this world may be likened to the frosty frigid wind, that blows across and ravages the (ripe) harvest of the people who have sinned against themselves. Allah is not unjust to them, but in fact, they are cruel to their own souls"
  3,118,"Oh you who believe! Do not take as your intimate friends, anyone other than your own _ (the believers). The others _ (the unbelievers) _ spare no effort to corrupt you. They love to see you in trouble. (Malice and) hatred has already burst forth from their lips, but what their hearts hold back is far worse. We have explained the verses to you. If you would only understand"
  3,119,"Here you are! You have love (and fondness) for them, but they do not love you at all, (even though) you believe in all the scriptures. When they see you, they say, \"We believe!\" But when they are alone, they bite off their fingertips in their rage towards you. Say, \"Die (and fade away) in your fury! Allah is well Aware of that which is in your heart"
  3,120,"They grieve when something good comes your way, and they rejoice when ill luck strikes you. So, provided you persevere patiently, their (two-faced) chicanery (and deceit) will not harm you a bit. Indeed, Allah holds in His sway everything they do"
  3,121,"(Remember) when you left your home at day break, in order to post the believers to their base in the battlefield! Allah is the all-Hearing and the all-Knowing"
