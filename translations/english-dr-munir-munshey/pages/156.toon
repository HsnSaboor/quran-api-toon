  7,44,"The people of paradise will call out to the inmates of hell, \"We found to be true (all) the promises our Lord made to us. Did you (also) find everything your Lord promised to you to be true?\" They would reply, \"Yes!\" Whereupon, an announcer in their midst will proclaim, \"The curse of Allah is upon the evildoers"
  7,45,(Cursed are) those who prevent people from the path of Allah and seek to make it crooked. They do not believe in the afterlife
  7,46,"A barrier shall exist between the two groups _ (those in paradise and those in hell). At a height would be (a third group of) men who would long to enter paradise, but would not have entered it yet. They would recognize all by their distinctive features. To the people of paradise they would say, \"Peace upon you"
  7,47,"When their sight turns to the inmates of hellfire, they would say, \"Our Lord, do not include us with the wicked people"
  7,48,"The people at the height would recognize men (in the hellfire) by their distinctive features and would say to them, \"Did all your followers and your hoarded wealth _ of which you were so proud (and used to boast) _ help you in the least"
  7,49,"Hadn´t you sworn about these very people that Allah would grant them nothing of His Mercy?\" (But now they are told), \"Enter the paradise! You shall have no fear, nor shall you ever grieve (or be sorry)"
  7,50,"The inmates of hell will call out to the people of paradise, saying, \"Pour us some water, or some of the provisions Allah has granted you.\" The people of paradise would reply, \"Allah has of course denied these things to those who denied the truth"
  7,51,"(They are) those who took their faith as mere play and pastime. The life of this world deceived them.\" (Allah says), \"So, today We shall ignore them just like they forgot the meeting of this day. (This is) because they used to reject Our revelations"
