quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  29,7,"We will mend all the shortcomings of those who believe and do good deeds. We would certainly cleanse (and rid) them of their sins, and We would grant them the best of rewards according to the deeds they performed"
  29,8,"We have directed man to treat his parents with compassion. But do not obey if they force you to associate partners with Me _ something you have no knowledge of! Towards Me is your final retreat. Then, I will let you know everything you have been doing"
  29,9,We would certainly usher those who believe and do good deeds into the group of the righteous ones
  29,10,"And among the people are those who say, ´we believe in Allah!´, but when they are bothered because of their belief in Allah they consider the suffering caused by the people to be equal to the punishment inflicted by Allah. If victory comes from Allah, they will say, \"Of course, we were with you.\" Isn´t Allah aware of whatever lies in the heart of everyone in the world"
  29,11,"Allah definitely knows the ones who believe, and He definitely knows the hypocrites"
  29,12,"The unbelievers say to the believers, \"Follow our way (of life). Let us assume your sins.\" But they are not going to take over a single one of anybody´s sins. They are most certainly lying"
  29,13,"They surely carry the weight of their own sins, and also that of others whom they misled. Burdens to add to their own load! On the Day of Judgment, they will most certainly be asked about the lies they used to invent"
  29,14,"We had sent Nooh to his people and he stayed with them for nine hundred and fifty years. Then, a storm grabbed them. They were all evil doers"
