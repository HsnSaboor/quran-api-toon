quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  40,34,"Earlier, Yusuf had brought you obvious proofs, but you remained skeptical about what he brought you. When he died you claimed that Allah would never raise another messenger after him. This is how Allah leads the transgressors and the skeptics astray"
  40,35,"Those who bicker about the verses of Allah without a valid reason or without any revelation having come to them! According to Allah, as well as those who believe, such an act is very disgusting. This is how Allah places a seal upon the heart of every arrogant and bullying person"
  40,36,"The pharaoh said, \"Oh Haaman, build me a lofty tower so I may attain the (right) means"
  40,37,"The means to (reach) the heaven, so I may look at Musa´s God! But I really think he, (Musa), is just lying.\" Thus the wickedness of pharoah´s action was made to appear adorable to him, and he was prevented from the (straight) path. The tricks of the pharaoh merely led him to his ruin"
  40,38,"The one who had believed said, \"Oh my people! Follow me. Let me guide you along the (sensible) virtuous path"
  40,39,"Oh my people, the life of this world is in fact a brief and transient enjoyment. While the afterlife is certainly the place of permanence"
  40,40,"The punishment of the one who does evil would only be equal to _ (and would not exceed) _ the nature (and the severity) of his sin. On the other hand, the men and women who perform the righteous deeds _ provided they are the believers _ would surely be the ones entering paradise. They would be granted abundant (infinite and endless) bounties without reckoning"
