quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  7,131,"When the good times arrived, they said, \"We deserve this!\" But when misfortune struck, they associated an evil omen with Musa and his companions, and blamed them for the hard times. Their evil omen exists with Allah! But most of them do not realize"
  7,132,"They said, \"We are never going to believe you no matter what signs you bring us, to try to bewitch us"
  7,133,"Thereupon We let loose upon them the punishment of the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs and the blood _ (a succession of) elaborately manifest proofs. But they continued to display arrogance. They were a criminal nation"
  7,134,"Whenever a scourge landed on them they would say, \"Oh Musa, implore your Lord on our behalf because of what He has promised you. We would certainly believe you if you rid us of this torment, and we will certainly let the children of Israel go with you"
  7,135,"But as We eased away the torment for awhile to let them redeem themselves, they always failed to keep their promise"
  7,136,"So, because they had rejected Our signs, and were unmindful of them, We exacted a revenge from them and drowned them in the sea"
  7,137,"We caused the nation that was considered weak and oppressed to inherit the eastern and the western parts of the land We had blessed. Then, the good word of your Lord (concerning prosperity) for the children of Israel was fulfilled. We totally demolished everything the pharaoh and his nation had contrived, every structure they ever raised"
