quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,1,"They ask you about the booties (of battle). Say, \"The booties belong to Allah and the messenger. So fear Allah and patch up (all) matters (of differences) among you. Obey Allah and His messenger, if you are the believers"
  8,2,"In fact, the (true) believers are those, whose hearts experience the fear (and cringe) at the (mere) mention of Allah. When the verses are read to them, their belief (surges and) grows. They place their trust in their Lord (exclusively)"
  8,3,Those who establish ´salat´ and spend (in Our cause) out of what We grant them
  8,4,"Such are the true (and sincere) believers. With their Lord, they have a high rank, forgiveness and a generous sustenance"
  8,5,A group of believers did not like it when your Lord made you leave your home for the right cause
  8,6,They wrangled with you about the truth even after it became (amply) evident. (They acted) as if they were being driven to their death while they looked on (helplessly)
  8,7,"(Remember) when Allah promised you, that one of the two groups (of enemy) shall be yours. You preferred the group that was not too heavily armed. But Allah wanted the truth to triumph by His words; (He wanted) to strike forcefully at, (and cut off), the very roots of the unbelievers"
  8,8,"So He may cause the truth to triumph, and so He may rout (and thwart) the untruth (and the absurd) _ much to the dislike of the criminals"
