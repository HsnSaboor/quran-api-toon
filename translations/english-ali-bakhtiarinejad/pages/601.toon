quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By the time (the ages)
  103,2,indeed the human being is in loss
  103,3,except those who believe and do good works and recommend one another to the truth and recommend one another to the patience (and perseverance)
  104,1,Woe to every slanderer and fault-finder
  104,2,The one who piles up wealth and keeps count of it
  104,3,thinking that his wealth (and possession) makes him immortal
  104,4,"No way, he shall be thrown into the crushing fire"
  104,5,And do you know what the crushing fire is
  104,6,(It is) burning fire of God
  104,7,which rises over (and overtakes) the hearts
  104,8,indeed it closes over them
  104,9,in extending columns
  105,1,Did you not see what your Master did to companions of the elephant
  105,2,Did He not make their plot go wrong
  105,3,and sent flocks of bird on them
  105,4,throwing stones of baked clay at them
  105,5,then He made them like chewed up straw
