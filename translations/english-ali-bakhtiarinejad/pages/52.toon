quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,16,"those who say: our Master, we believed, forgive us our sins, and protect us from the punishment of the fire"
  3,17,the patients (and persevering) and the truthful ones and the obedient ones and the spenders (in God's way) and the ones asking for forgiveness at the dawn
  3,18,"God and the angels and those having knowledge testify that there is no god except Him, standing with the justice. There is no god except Him, the powerful and the wise"
  3,19,"Indeed, the way of life before God is submission (to Him), and those who were given the book did not disagree except after knowledge came to them, due to jealousy among them. And if anyone disbelieves in God’s signs, God is quick in accounting"
  3,20,"If they argue with you, say: I submitted my manner (of life) to God, and so did my followers. And say to those who were given the book and the illiterates: did you submit yourselves? If they submit then they are guided and if they refuse then your responsibility is only preaching. God sees His servants"
  3,21,"Those who disbelieve in God’s signs and kill the prophets unjustly and kill those among the people who order to justice, warn them of a painful punishment"
  3,22,"They are those whose works became useless in this world and in the hereafter, and there are no helpers for them"
