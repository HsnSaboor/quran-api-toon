quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  12,31,"So when she heard of their ploy, she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them, and gave everyone of them a knife and she said (to Joseph): come out before them. So when they saw him, they admired him and cut their hands (in amazement), and they said: God forbid, this is not a human being, this is not but a noble angel"
  12,32,"She said: this is the one whom you blamed me about him, and I certainly wanted to seduce him but he resisted, and if he does not do what I order him, he shall be imprisoned and he certainly becomes of the belittled ones"
  12,33,"He said: my Master, prison is more likeable to me than what they invite me to it, and if you do not turn their plot away from me, I may lean toward them and I would be one of the ignorant ones"
  12,34,So his Master answered him and turned their plot away from him. He hears all and knows all
  12,35,So it seemed proper to them that they should imprison him for a while even after they saw the signs (of his innocence)
  12,36,"And two young men entered the prison with him. One of them said: I see myself pressing wine (in my dreams). The other one said: I see myself carrying bread over my head and the birds eating from it. Tell us its interpretation as we see you are of the good doers"
  12,37,"He said: food that you are provided with it does not come to you, unless I tell you of its interpretation before it comes to you. This is some of what my Master taught me. I left faith of people who do not believe in God and they disbelieve in the hereafter"
