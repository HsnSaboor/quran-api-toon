quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  51,52,"Likewise, no messenger came to those before them unless they said: a magician or a madman"
  51,53,"Did they recommend (one another) to it? No, they are rebellious people"
  51,54,"So turn away from them, you are not to blame"
  51,55,"And (continue to) remind, as indeed the reminder benefits the believers"
  51,56,And I did not create Jinn and humans except to serve Me (and no one else)
  51,57,I do not want any provision from them and I do not want them to feed Me
  51,58,Indeed God is the provider having the power and the definitive strength
  51,59,"So indeed there are shares (of punishment) for those who did wrong same as shares of their companions, so they should not ask Me to rush"
  51,60,So woe to those who disbelieved from their day that they are promised
  52,1,By the mountain (Mount Sinai)
  52,2,and by a written book
  52,3,in unrolled scroll
  52,4,and by the thriving (and frequented) house
  52,5,and by the raised roof
  52,6,and by the blazing (and swollen) sea
  52,7,your Master’s punishment is certainly a reality
  52,8,No one (and nothing) can repel it
  52,9,A day when the sky swings back and forth
  52,10,"and the mountains move about, traveling"
  52,11,woe to the deniers on that day
  52,12,those playing around in useless talk
  52,13,A day when they are forcefully pushed into fire of hell
  52,14,This is the fire that you were denying it
