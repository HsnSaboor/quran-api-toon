  5,110,"And when God said: Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favor upon you and your mother when I supported you with the Holy Spirit and you spoke with the people in the cradle and in old age, and when I taught you the book and the wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel, and when you made something from the clay in the shape of a bird with My permission, then you blew into it and it became a (real) bird with My permission, and you healed the born blinds and the lepers with My permission, and when you brought back the dead (to life) with My permission, and when I withheld children of Israel from you when you brought them the clear proofs but the disbelievers among them said: this is nothing but obvious magic"
