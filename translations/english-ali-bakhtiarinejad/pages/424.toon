quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  33,44,"Their greeting on a day that they meet Him is: peace (and well-being). And He has prepared a noble (and generous) reward for them"
  33,45,"Prophet, We sent you as a witness and a giver of good news and a warner"
  33,46,"and a caller toward God by His permission, and as a shining lamp"
  33,47,And give good news to the believers that they have a great bounty from God
  33,48,And do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites and disregard their harassment and put your trust in God. God is enough as an advocate
  33,49,"You who believe, when you marry the believing women and then divorce them before you touch them, then they are not responsible for any waiting period for you that you count it, so compensate them and let them go free, a nice leaving"
  33,50,"Prophet, We made lawful for you, your wives that you gave them their compensations (marriage portions), and those whom your right hand owns (slaves) from what God gave you as spoil, and daughters of your paternal uncle (your father’s brother), and daughters of your paternal aunts (your father’s sister), and daughters of your maternal uncles (your mother’s brother), and daughters of your maternal aunts (your mother’s sister) who migrated with you, and a believing woman who gives herself to the prophet (without asking for marriage portion) if the prophet wants to marry her, this (last group) is only for you and not the other believers. We also know what We mandated to them (the believers) regarding their wives and those whom their right hands own, so that there would be no difficulty (or blame) on you. And God is forgiving and merciful"
