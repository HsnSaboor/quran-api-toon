quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,indeed this is a noble Quran
  56,78,in a concealed book
  56,79,none touch it except the purified ones
  56,80,a sending down from the Master of Human kind
  56,81,Do you take this saying lightly
  56,82,and you make it your livelihood to deny it
  56,83,So why not when it (life) reaches the throat
  56,84,and you are watching at that moment
  56,85,while We are closer to him than you but you do not see
  56,86,"then if you are not obligated, why don't"
  56,87,"you return it (the soul to the body), if you are truthful"
  56,88,But if he is one of the close ones (to God)
  56,89,then ease and comfort and gardens of delight (are for him)
  56,90,And if he is among associates of the right hand (the fortunate)
  56,91,then peace (and well-being) for you among associates of the right hand
  56,92,And if he is among the misguided deniers
  56,93,then entertainment of boiling water
  56,94,and entering (and burning in) hellfire (is for him)
  56,95,And this is indeed the sure truth
  56,96,So glorify the name of your great Master
  57,1,"Everything in the skies and the earth glorifies God, and He is the powerful, the wise"
  57,2,"Rule of the skies and the earth belongs to Him, He gives life and causes death, and He is capable of everything"
  57,3,"He is the first and the last, and the obvious and the obscure, and He knows everything"
