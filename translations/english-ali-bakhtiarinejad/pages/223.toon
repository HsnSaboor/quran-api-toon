quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,13,"Or they say: he has made it up. Say: then bring ten chapters made up like that, and call on anyone you can other than God if you are truthful"
  11,14,"If they did not answer to you, then know that it was sent down with God’s knowledge, and that there is no god except Him, so are you submitters"
  11,15,"Whoever wants this world's life and its luxury, We pay them for their works in it and they will not be short changed in it"
  11,16,"They are those who have nothing in the hereafter except the fire, and whatever they made in it (this world) is made useless and whatever they used to do is worthless"
  11,17,"Is someone who is on a clear proof from his Master and a witness from Him reads it, and book of Moses was a guide/leader and a mercy before it (like someone who wants this world's life)? They believe in it, and whoever disbelieves in it among the factions then the fire is his promised place. So do not be in doubt about it, indeed it is the truth from your Master, but most people do not believe"
  11,18,"And who is more wrong than someone who makes up a lie (and attributes it) to God? They will be brought before their Master, and the witnesses will say: these are those who lied against their Master. Know that God’s curse is on the wrongdoers"
  11,19,"Those who obstruct God’s way and they look for its distortion, and they are disbelievers in the hereafter"
