quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  89,24,"He says: I wish that I had sent ahead (something) for my (new) life"
  89,25,So on that day no one punishes as He punishes
  89,26,and no one ties up as He ties up
  89,27,You the reassured soul
  89,28,"return to your Master, pleased (with Him) and pleasing (to Him)"
  89,29,so you enter among My servants
  89,30,and you enter My garden
  90,1,I swear by this land
  90,2,and you are a resident of this land
  90,3,and by the father and what he fathered
  90,4,that We have certainly created the human being in distress
  90,5,Does he think that no one will ever have power over him
  90,6,"He says: I wasted a lot of wealth"
  90,7,Does he think that no one saw him
  90,8,Did we not make two eyes for him
  90,9,and a tongue and two lips
  90,10,and We guided him to the two ways
  90,11,But he did not take/attempt the winding mountain road
  90,12,And do you know what the winding mountain road is
  90,13,(It is) freeing a slave
  90,14,"or in a day of famine, feeding"
  90,15,an orphan being related
  90,16,or a poor person in ruins (and penniless)
  90,17,then being of those who believed and recommend one another to the perseverance (and patience) and recommend one another to kindness
  90,18,They are associates of the right hand (the fortunate)
  90,19,"And those who disbelieved in Our signs, they are associates of the left hand (the unfortunate)"
  90,20,and a fire is closed over upon them
