quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  24,21,"You who believe, do not follow Satan's footsteps, and whoever follows Satan's footsteps (should know that), indeed he instructs to the indecency and to the wrong (unacceptable). And if it was not for God’s grace and mercy on you, none of you would ever be purified (absolved), but God purifies anyone He wants. God hears all and knows all"
  24,22,"And those who have grace and plenty (of wealth) should not swear that they would not give to the relatives (and close ones), and the needy, and the migrants in God’s way, and they should excuse and overlook. Do you not like God to forgive you? God is forgiving and merciful"

  24,26,"The bad women are for the bad men, and the bad men are for the bad women, and the good women are for good men, and the good men are for good women. They are clear of what they say (about them), forgiveness and honorable provision is for them"
  24,27,"You who believe, do not enter any houses except your houses until you ask for familiarity (and permission) and greet its resident. That is better for you, so that you may take notice"
