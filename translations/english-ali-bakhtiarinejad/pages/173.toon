quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,171,"And (remember) when We raised the mountain over them as if it was a canopy, and they thought that it falls on them, (We said): take what We gave you firmly and take notice of what is in it, so that you may control yourselves"
  7,172,"And (remember) when your Master took from the backs of the children of Adam, their descendants, and made them testify against themselves, (and He asked): am I not your Master? They said: yes, we testify. So that on the resurrection day you do not say: we were unaware of this"
  7,173,"Or you (would not) say: it was only our fathers who associated (partner with God) in the past, and we were descendents after them, do You destroy us for what the followers of falsehood did"
  7,174,"That is how We explain the signs, so that they may return"
  7,175,"And read to them story of the one whom We gave him Our signs, then he stepped away from it, so Satan followed him and he became of the deceived ones"
  7,176,"And If We wanted, We would have elevated him with it (Our signs), but he held on to the earth and followed his desires. His example is like the dog, if you attack it, it pants and if you leave it, it pants. That is example of the people who denied Our signs. So tell the stories, so that they may think"
  7,177,The example of the people who denied Our signs and were wrong to themselves is awful
  7,178,"Whoever God guides, then he is guided, and whoever He misguides, then they are the losers"
