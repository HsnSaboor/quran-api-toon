  16,11,He grows crops and olives and dates and grapes and all kind of produce with it for you. Indeed there is a sign in that for people who think
  16,12,"And He brought the night and the day and the sun and the moon under your control (and at your service), and also stars are under control by His command. Indeed there are signs in that for people who understand"
  16,13,And whatever He created for you in various colors on the earth. There is a sign in that for those who notice
  16,14,"He is the One who brought the sea under control, so that you eat fresh meat from it, and you bring out jewelry from it that you wear it. And you see the ships plowing through it so that you look for His bounty, and you may be thankful"
