quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"saying: are you among those confirming (the resurrection and the judgment)"
  37,53,Would we indeed be judged when we die and become dust and bones
  37,54,"He said: do you know (him)"
  37,55,So he looked and saw him in middle of the hellfire
  37,56,"He said: by God, you almost ruined me"
  37,57,"and if it was not for my Master’s favor, I would have certainly been of those who are brought (to hell)"
  37,58,and are we not to die (again)
  37,59,"except our first death, and we are not punished"
  37,60,Indeed this is the great victory
  37,61,"For (something) like this, the doers should do (good deeds)"
  37,62,Is this a better entertainment or the Zaqqum tree
  37,63,Indeed We made it a suffering for the wrongdoers
  37,64,It is a tree that comes out from bottom of the hellfire
  37,65,Its sprout is like heads of the devils
  37,66,And they certainly eat from it and fill their stomachs from it
  37,67,Then indeed they have a mixture of boiling water (to drink) over it
  37,68,Then their return is certainly to the hellfire
  37,69,Indeed they found their fathers lost (from the right path)
  37,70,and yet they rushed on their footsteps
  37,71,And most of the earlier ones have certainly lost (the right path) before them
  37,72,And We have certainly sent warners among them
  37,73,So see what the end of those who were warned was
  37,74,except God's devoted servants
  37,75,"And Noah has certainly called Us, and We are certainly best of the responders"
  37,76,And We saved him and his family from the great distress
