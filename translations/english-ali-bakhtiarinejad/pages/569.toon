quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,(although) they are made to see them. The guilty wish to redeems himself from punishment of that day by (offering) his children
  70,12,and his spouse and his brother
  70,13,and his family who sheltered him
  70,14,"and everyone on the earth, so that it saves him"
  70,15,No way. Indeed it is flame (of hell)
  70,16,stripping off the scalp (by burning it)
  70,17,calling anyone who turned his back and turned away
  70,18,and collected and withheld (his wealth)
  70,19,Indeed the human being is created greedy (and anxious)
  70,20,Impatient (and anxious) when the badness touches him
  70,21,and miserly (and stingy) when the goodness touches him
  70,22,except the performers of mandatory prayers
  70,23,those who perform their mandatory prayer all the time
  70,24,and those who have a known entitlement in their wealth
  70,25,for the beggar and the disadvantaged
  70,26,and those who acknowledge the judgment day
  70,27,and those who are afraid of their Master's punishment
  70,28,as indeed no one is safe from their Master's punishment
  70,29,and those who guard their private parts
  70,30,except from their spouses or what their right hands own as indeed they are blameless
  70,31,and anyone who looks for (anything) beyond this then they are of those exceeding the limits
  70,32,and those who observe their trusts and their promise
  70,33,and those who are upstanding in their testimony
  70,34,and those who guard their mandatory prayer
  70,35,They are the honored ones in gardens
  70,36,"So what is with those who disbelieved, rushing (and staring) toward you"
  70,37,from the right and from the left in groups
  70,38,Does every one of them expect to enter garden of delight
  70,39,No way. Indeed We created them from what they know
