quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun is rolled up
  81,2,and when the stars are dimmed
  81,3,and when the mountains are moved
  81,4,and when the ten months pregnant camels are abandoned
  81,5,and when the wild animals are gathered
  81,6,and when the seas are set on fire
  81,7,and when the souls are paired
  81,8,and when the girl buried alive is asked
  81,9,for what sin she was killed
  81,10,and when the pages (of deeds) are opened
  81,11,and when the sky is removed
  81,12,and when the hellfire is flared up
  81,13,and when the garden is brought near
  81,14,a person knows what he brought along
  81,15,So I swear by the returning stars/planets
  81,16,running their course (and orbit) and hiding
  81,17,and by the night when it turns dark
  81,18,and by the morning when it breathes (and lights up)
  81,19,indeed it (Quran) is word of a noble messenger
  81,20,powerful and distinguished with the owner of the throne
  81,21,he is obeyed and is honest
  81,22,And your companion is not a madman
  81,23,and he has certainly seen him on the clear horizon
  81,24,And he is not stingy with the unseen (that is revealed to him)
  81,25,and it is not word of expelled Satan
  81,26,So where are you going
  81,27,It is not but a reminder for humankind
  81,28,for anyone of you who want to go straight
  81,29,"And you do not want (anything) except that which God, Master of humankind wants"
