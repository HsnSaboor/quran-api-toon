quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  2,234,"And those (men) among you who die and leave their wives behind, (their widows) should wait for four months and ten days. And when they reached their term, then there is no blame on you for whatever they do about themselves appropriately. God is well aware of what you do"
  2,235,"There is no blame on you for what you hint about it for proposing to women or keep it to yourselves. God knows that you are going to remember them. But do not make secret promises to them unless you speak properly. And do not decide on marriage tie before the prescribed term reaches its end. And know that God knows what is in your minds, so beware of Him, and know that God is forgiving and patient"
  2,236,"There is no blame on you if you divorced women whom you did not touch them (and did not have sex with them) or set a marriage portion for them. Provide them with appropriate provisions, the wealthy according to his ability and the poor according to his ability, this is a duty upon the good doers"
  2,237,"And if you divorced them before touching them while you did set a marriage portion for them, then half of what you set (is your duty to pay), unless they forgive it or he who has the tie of marriage in his hands forgives it, and it is closer to self control if you forgive, and do not forget the grace (and generosity) between yourselves. God sees what you do"
