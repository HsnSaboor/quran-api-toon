quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  46,29,"And (remember) when We turned a number of the Jinn toward you listening to the Quran, so when they were in its presence, they said: be quiet (and listen). Then when it was over, they returned to their people, warning (them)"
  46,30,"They said: our people, indeed we heard a book that was sent down after Moses, confirming what is before it, guiding to the truth and to a straight path"
  46,31,"Our people, answer God’s caller and believe in him/Him. He forgives some of your sins and protects you from a painful punishment"
  46,32,"And anyone who does not answer God’s caller, then he does not incapacitate (God) on the earth and there is no protector for him other than Him. They are in an obvious error"
  46,33,"Did they not see that God, the One who created the skies and the earth and he did not tire out by their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Yes, indeed He is capable of everything"
  46,34,"And on a day that those who disbelieved are presented to the fire (they are told): is this not the truth? They say: yes, by our Master (this is the truth). He says: so, taste the punishment because you used to disbelieve"
  46,35,"So persevere (and be patient) as the strong-willed (and determined) messengers were, and do not ask to rush (the punishment) for them. On a day that they see what they are promised, (it is) as if they only stayed (dead) for an hour of a day. This is a notification. So would anyone be destroyed except the disobedient people"
