quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,The believers have succeeded
  23,2,those who are humble in their prayers
  23,3,and those who stay away from the useless (acts and talks)
  23,4,and those who do their mandatory charity
  23,5,and those who guard their private parts
  23,6,"except with their spouses or what they own, then indeed they are blameless"
  23,7,"and anyone who look for beyond this, then they are those who exceed the limits"
  23,8,and those who observe their trusts and their promise
  23,9,and those who guard their mandatory prayer
  23,10,they are the inheritors
  23,11,"those who inherit the paradise, remaining in there forever"
  23,12,And We have certainly created the human being from clay’s extract
  23,13,Then We placed him as a fertilized egg in a safe quarter (the womb)
  23,14,"Then We made the fertilized egg into a (dangling, clinging, and leach like) blood clot, then We made the clot into a (piece of) chewed flesh, then We made the chewed flesh into bones, then We covered the bones with flesh, then We turned it into another creation. So blessed is God, best of the creators"
  23,15,Then you certainly die after that
  23,16,Then indeed you are raised on the resurrection day
  23,17,"And We have certainly created seven paths/layers (of skies) above you, and We are not neglectful of the creation"
