quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,103,So when they both submitted and he (Abraham) put him down on the forehead
  37,104,"and We called him: Abraham"
  37,105,you have fulfilled the vision. Indeed that is how We reward the good doers
  37,106,Indeed this was the obvious test
  37,107,and We ransomed him with a great sacrifice
  37,108,And We left for him (a good name) among the later ones
  37,109,Peace (and well-being) on Abraham
  37,110,That is how We reward the good doers
  37,111,Indeed he was among Our believing servants
  37,112,"And We gave him good news of Isaac, a prophet from the righteous"
  37,113,"And We blessed him and Isaac, and from their descendants, (some) are good doers and (some) are obviously wrongdoers to themselves"
  37,114,And We have certainly favored to Moses and Aaron
  37,115,And We saved them both and their people from the great distress
  37,116,"And We helped them, so they became the winners"
  37,117,And We gave them the clear (and clarifying) book
  37,118,and We guided them to the straight path
  37,119,And We left both of them (a good name) among the later ones
  37,120,Peace (and well-being) on Moses and Aaron
  37,121,Indeed that is how We reward the good doers
  37,122,Indeed they were both among Our believing servants
  37,123,And indeed Elias was one of the messengers
  37,124,"When he said to his people: would you not be cautious (of God)"
  37,125,do you call on Baal and you abandon best of the creators
  37,126,God is your Master and Master of your forefathers
