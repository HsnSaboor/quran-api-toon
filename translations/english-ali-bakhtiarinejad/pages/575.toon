quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Indeed your Master knows that you and a group of those with you get up nearly two third of the night or half of it or one third of it. God determines (length of) the night and the day, and He knows that you never calculate it, so He turned to you (in mercy), therefore read as much as you can from Quran. He knows that some of you are going to get sick and others move around on the earth looking for His bounty and others fight in God's way, so read as much as you can from it, and perform the mandatory prayer and give to mandatory charity and lend God a good loan (or offer God a good deed). And whatever good you send ahead for yourselves, you find it as a better and greater reward with God. And ask forgiveness of God, as God is indeed forgiving and merciful"
  74,1,You who cover yourself
  74,2,get up and warn
  74,3,and magnify your Master
  74,4,and cleanse your clothes
  74,5,and keep away from the filth
  74,6,and do not do favor to ask for more
  74,7,and be patient for (the sake of) your Master
  74,8,So when the trumpet is blown
  74,9,then that day is a difficult day
  74,10,not easy upon the disbelievers
  74,11,Leave Me alone with whom I created
  74,12,and I gave him plenty of wealth
  74,13,and sons (who are) present
  74,14,"and made (everything) easy for him, so easy"
  74,15,yet he desires that I increase (it for him)
  74,16,No way. He is indeed stubborn against Our signs
  74,17,I am going to make him suffer a terrible punishment
