quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"Those who disbelieved and obstructed God’s way, He made their works ineffective (and useless)"
  47,2,"And those who believed and did good works and believed in what was sent down to Muhammad, which is the truth from their Master, He removed their sins from them and improved their condition"
  47,3,"That is because those who disbelieved followed the falsehood, while those who believed followed the truth from their Master. That is how God give the people their examples"
  47,4,"And when you encounter those who disbelieved (during war), then strike their necks until you have thoroughly overcome them, then fasten the ties firmly, then later (set them free) either by a favor or by a ransom until the war puts down its burdens (and comes to an end). So it is (God's will), and if God wants, He would take revenge from them, but (He doesn't) so that He tests some of you by the others. Those who are killed in God’s way, He never makes their works ineffective (and useless)"
  47,5,He is going to guide them and puts their condition in order
  47,6,"and He admits them into the garden, which He described it for them"
  47,7,"You who believe, if you help God, He helps you and solidifies your steps"
  47,8,"And those who disbelieved, then they have misery, and He makes their works ineffective"
  47,9,"That is because they disliked what God sent down, so He made their works useless"
  47,10,"Did they not travel on the earth to see what the end of those before them was? God destroyed them, and for the disbelievers is same as that"
  47,11,That is because God is protector (and supporter) of those who believed while the disbelievers have no protector
