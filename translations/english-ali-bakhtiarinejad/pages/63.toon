quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,How can you disbelieve while God’s signs are read to you and His messenger is among you? And whoever holds on to God is indeed guided to a straight path
  3,102,"You who believe, be cautious of God, the way He is deserved to be cautioned, and do not die except while you are submitted (to God)"
  3,103,"And all of you hold on to the rope of God (Quran), and do not be divided. And remember God’s favor upon you, when you were enemies and He united your hearts, and you became brothers by His favor and when you were on the edge of a pit of fire and He saved you from it. This is how God clarifies His signs for you, so you may be guided"
  3,104,And there should be a group of you that invite to the good and instruct to the right (acceptable) and prohibit from the wrong (unacceptable). And they are the successful
  3,105,"And do not be like those who divided and disagreed after clear proofs came to them, and for them there is a great punishment"
  3,106,"On a day that some faces become white (and are honored) and some faces become black (and are ashamed). As for those whose faces turn black (they will be told): did you disbelieve after your belief, so taste the punishment because of what you used to disbelieve"
  3,107,"And those whose faces turn white will be in God’s mercy, remaining in it forever"
  3,108,"These are God’s signs that We read them to you in truth, and God does not want any injustice for any being"
