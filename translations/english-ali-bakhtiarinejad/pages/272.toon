quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  16,43,And We did not send (messengers) before you except men whom We revealed to them. So ask people of the reminder (people of the book) if you do not know
  16,44,"(We sent them) with the clear proofs and the scriptures. And We sent down the reminder (Quran) to you so that you clarify for the people what was sent down to them, and that they may think"
  16,45,"Do those who plot bad (plots) feel safe from God making the earth swallow them, or the punishment coming to them from somewhere they do not realize"
  16,46,"Or He takes them when they are going back and forth, then they cannot disable/escape it"
  16,47,Or He takes them in state of fear (or by wasting them away)? Indeed your Master is gentle and merciful
  16,48,"Or did they not look at everything that God created which they incline their shadows to the right and to the left, showing humbleness for God, while they are submissive (and inferior)"

  16,51,"And God said: do not take two gods, indeed He is One god, and fear only Me"
  16,52,"And everything in the skies and on the earth belongs to Him, and the way of life is permanently His. Are you cautious of other than God"

  16,54,"Then when He removes the harm from you, immediately some of you associate (partners) with your Master"
