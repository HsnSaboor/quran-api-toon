quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,"And how many of generation did We destroy before them who were more courageous (and powerful) than them, and they explored throughout the land? Is there any way (or place) of escape"
  50,37,There is certainly a reminder in that for anyone who has a heart or listens while he is present (and attentive)
  50,38,And We have certainly created the skies and the earth and whatever is between them in six stages and no fatigue touched us
  50,39,So persevere (and be patient) about what they say and glorify your Master with praise before the sunrise and before the sunset
  50,40,And glorify Him part of the night and after showing humbleness
  50,41,"And listen, on a day when the caller calls out from a nearby place"
  50,42,a day when they hear the awesome roar in truth. That is the day of coming out (of graves)
  50,43,"Indeed We give life and We cause death, and the final return is to Us"
  50,44,A day that the earth breaks open from them (and they come out of it) quickly. This is a gathering that is easy for Us
  50,45,We know better about what they say. You are not to force them. So remind anyone who fears My threat by the Quran
  51,1,By the scattering (winds) that scatters
  51,2,and by the carriers of a heavy load (of rain)
  51,3,and by the (ships) sailing with ease
  51,4,and by the distributor of affair (the angels)
  51,5,what you are promised is certainly true
  51,6,and the judgment is certainly a reality
