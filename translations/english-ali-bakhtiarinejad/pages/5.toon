quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,25,"And give good news to those who believed and did good works that they will have gardens which rivers flow through them. Whenever they are given a fruit to eat from there, they say: it is the same thing that we were provided before. For they will be given similar to that, and they will have pure spouses in it and will live in there forever"
  2,26,"God does not shy away from giving example of a mosquito or something beyond it (bigger or smaller). And as for those who believed, they know that it is the truth and from their Master. And as for those who disbelieved, they say: what did God mean by this example? He misguides many by it, and guides many by it, while He only misguides the disobedient ones with it"
  2,27,"Those who break their promise to God after committing to it and cut what God ordered to be joined and spread corruption on the earth, they are the losers"
  2,28,"How do you disbelieve in God, when you were dead (lifeless) and He gave you life then He makes you die and brings you back to life, and then you are returned to Him"
  2,29,He is the One who created everything on the earth for you. He then turned to the sky and shaped it into seven skies. He knows everything
