quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  27,64,"Or One who initiates the creation then brings it back and provides for you from the sky and the earth? Is there a god with God? Say: bring your proof if you are truthful"
  27,65,"Say: no one in the skies and on the earth knows the unseen except God, and they do not realize when they will be raised"
  27,66,"No, but their knowledge falls short about the hereafter, rather they are in doubt about it or they are blind about it"
  27,67,"And those who disbelieved say: are we brought out when we and our fathers become dust"
  27,68,We and our fathers have certainly been promised this in the past. This is only stories of the earlier ones
  27,69,"Say: travel throughout the earth and see what the end of the guilty ones was"
  27,70,"And do not be sad about them, and do not be troubled from what they plot"
  27,71,"And they say: when is this promise if you are truthful"
  27,72,"Say: perhaps, some of that which you want to be rushed is right behind you"
  27,73,"And indeed your Master is graceful to the people, but most of them do not thank"
  27,74,And your Master indeed knows what their chests hide and what they disclose
  27,75,And there is nothing hidden in the sky and on the earth unless it is in a clear book
  27,76,Indeed this Quran tells the children of Israel most of what they disagree about it
