quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,32,"Those who were arrogant say to those who were weak: did we block you from the guidance after it came to you? No, but you were guilty"
  34,33,"And those who were weak say to those who were arrogant: no, but (it was) a plot at night and day, when you ordered us to disbelieve in God and to set up equals for Him. And they hide the regret when they see the punishment, and We put the shackles around the necks of those who disbelieved. Are they punished except for what they were doing"
  34,34,"And We did not send any warner in any town, unless its rich (and wealthy) said: indeed we disbelieve in what you are sent with it"
  34,35,"And they said: we have more wealth and children, and we will not be punished"
  34,36,"Say: indeed my Master increases and decreases the provision for anyone He wants, but most of the people do not know"
  34,37,"And it is not your wealth or your children that bring you closer to Us, but anyone who believed and did good works, then they have the double reward for what they did, and they will be safe (and secure) in the chambers"
  34,38,"And those who try to disable (and invalidate) Our signs, they are brought into the punishment"
  34,39,"Say: Indeed my Master increases and decreases the provision for anyone He wants among His servants, and anything you spend (in God's way), then He replaces it, and He is the best of the providers"
