quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  62,1,"Whatever in the skies and whatever on the earth glorify God, the ruler, the holy, the powerful, the wise"
  62,2,He is the One who raised among the illiterate a messenger from themselves to read to them His verses and to purify (and absolve) them and to teach them the book and the wisdom while they were indeed in obvious error in the past
  62,3,"And others among them who have not joined them yet. And He is the powerful, the wise"
  62,4,"That is God's grace, He gives it to anyone He wants, and God has enormous grace"
  62,5,Example of those who were charged with the Torah and they did not carry it out is like the example of the donkey carrying books. The example of the people who denied God's signs is bad. And God does not guide the wrongdoing people
  62,6,"Say: you who are Jewish, if you claim that you are God's friend (and His chosen ones) and not other people, then wish for the death (to go to paradise sooner) if you are truthful"
  62,7,"And they will never wish it because of what they sent ahead, and God knows the wrongdoers well"
  62,8,"Say: indeed the death that you run away from it catches up with you then you are returned to knower of the unseen and the visible, then He informs you of what you were doing"
