quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is with you? How do you judge
  37,155,Do you not take notice
  37,156,Or do you have a clear reason
  37,157,"Then bring your book (document), if you are truthful"
  37,158,"And they put a relationship between Him and the Jinn, while the Jinn have certainly known that they shall be brought (to punishment)"
  37,159,God is flawless (and beyond) what they describe
  37,160,except God's devoted servants (who are saved from punishment)
  37,161,So indeed you and what you serve
  37,162,you are not able to mislead any one (of God's devoted servants)
  37,163,except someone who enters (and burns in) the hellfire
  37,164,"And (the angels say): no one is from us unless he has a known position"
  37,165,and we are certainly those lined up in rows
  37,166,and we are certainly those who glorify (God)
  37,167,And they (the disbelievers) were certainly saying
  37,168,indeed if we had a reminder (or a scripture) from the earlier ones with us
  37,169,we would have certainly been of God's devoted servants
  37,170,"And they disbelieved in it (Quran), so they will know"
  37,171,"And Our word already went out to Our servants, the messengers"
  37,172,that they are certainly helped
  37,173,and indeed Our troops are the winners
  37,174,So turn away from them for a while
  37,175,"and see them, for they will see"
  37,176,Do they want Our punishment in a hurry
  37,177,"Then when it comes down to their courtyard, it is a bad morning for those who were warned"
  37,178,And turn away from them for a while
  37,179,"and see, for they will see"
  37,180,"Your Master, the Master of power (and honor), is flawless (and He is beyond) what they describe"
  37,181,And peace (and well-being) upon the messengers
  37,182,"And all praise belongs to God, Master of humankind"
