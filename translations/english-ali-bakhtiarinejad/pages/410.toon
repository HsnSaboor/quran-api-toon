quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"And if We send a wind that they see it turn (their crops) yellow, they certainly become ungrateful after that"
  30,52,And indeed you cannot make the dead hear and you cannot make the deaf hear the call when they turn back going away
  30,53,And you are not a guide to the blind (who does not one to see the truth) about their error. You can only make someone listen who believes in Our signs and they are submitted
  30,54,"God is the One who created you from (a state of) weakness, then He makes strength after weakness, then He makes weakness and gray hair (and old age) after strength. He creates what He wants, and He is the knowledgeable and the capable"
  30,55,"And on a day that the hour establishes, the guilty ones swear that they only stayed (dead) for an hour. That is how they used to deviate"
  30,56,"And those who were given the knowledge and the belief say: you have certainly stayed until the resurrection day according to God’s book (and His mandate), so this is the resurrection day, but you did not know"
  30,57,"So on that day, apology of those who did wrong has no benefit, and they are not asked to plea (to appease God)"
  30,58,"And We have certainly given all kinds of example in this Quran for the people, and if you bring them a sign (miracle), those who disbelieve shall say: you are only falsifiers"
  30,59,That is how God puts a seal on the hearts of those who do not know
  30,60,"So persevere (and be patient) for God’s promise is indeed true, and do not let those who are uncertain look down upon you"
