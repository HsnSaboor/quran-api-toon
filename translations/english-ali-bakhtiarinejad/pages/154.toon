quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  7,31,"Children of Adam, wear your beautiful thing at every place of worship and eat and drink, but do not be excessive as God does not like the excessive ones"
  7,32,"Say: who did forbid God's beautiful things and the good provisions that He produced for His servants? Say: in this world's life it is for those who believed, and exclusively theirs on the resurrection day. That is how We explain the signs for people who know"
  7,33,"Say: my Master only forbade the indecencies whether it is openly or it is in secret, and sins, and undue oppression, and that you associate with God that which He did not send down any reason for it, and that you say about God what you do not know"
  7,34,"For every group there is an appointed time (to believe), and when their appointed time comes they cannot put it back an hour nor put it forward"
  7,35,"Children of Adam, if messengers from among you come to you telling you My signs then anyone who controls himself and straightens out, then they have no fear and no sadness"
  7,36,"And those who denied Our signs and were arrogant about them, they are inhabitants of the fire remaining in there forever"
  7,37,"Who is more wrong than someone who makes up a lie (and attributes it) to God or denies His signs? They get their share from (what is written in) the book, so that when Our messengers (angels of death) come to them to take back their life, saying: where are those whom you were calling on besides God? They say: they abandoned us. And they testify against themselves that they were disbelievers"
