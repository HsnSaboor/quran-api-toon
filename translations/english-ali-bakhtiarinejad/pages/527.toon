quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,Indeed those who do not believe in the hereafter shall name the angels the feminine names
  53,28,"while they have no knowledge of it, they only the follow guesswork, and guesswork is of no use against the truth at all"
  53,29,So stay away from anyone who turns away from Our reminder and only wants this world’s life
  53,30,That is their extent of the knowledge. Indeed your Master knows better anyone who lost His way and He knows better anyone who is guided
  53,31,"And whatever in the skies and whatever on the earth belongs to God, so that He penalizes those who did bad in what they did and to reward those who did good with the better (reward than what they did)"
  53,32,"those who avoid the big sins and the indecencies except the small ones. Your Master is vast in the forgiveness. He knows better about you, when He produced you from the earth and when you were hidden (as embryos) in your mothers’ wombs. So do not claim yourselves pure (and innocent), as He knows better who controls himself"
  53,33,Did you see the one who turned away
  53,34,and gave a little and was stingy
  53,35,"Does he have knowledge of the unseen, so he sees"
  53,36,Or was he not informed of what is in scriptures of Moses
  53,37,"and Abraham, the one who fulfilled (his duties)"
  53,38,That no bearer bears burden of another
  53,39,and that there is not (any reward) for the human being except what he tried for
  53,40,And that his efforts will be seen
  53,41,then he is rewarded with the full reward
  53,42,And that the final ending is to your Master
  53,43,And that He is he who makes (everyone) laugh and cry
  53,44,And He is he who causes death and gives life
