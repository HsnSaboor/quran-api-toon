  39,23,"God sent down the best saying as a book (with its verses) similar and often repeated, the skins of those who fear (disobeying) their Master shivers from it, then their skins and their hearts relaxes by God's remembrance. That is God’s guidance, He guides anyone He wants with it (according to His laws), and there is no guide for whomever God misguides"
