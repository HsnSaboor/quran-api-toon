quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  22,1,"People, be cautious of your Master. Indeed earthquake of the hour is an awesome thing"
  22,2,"On a day that you see it, every nursing mother forgets about what she nurses, and every pregnant female drops her load (and miscarries), and you see the people intoxicated while they are not intoxicated, but God’s punishment is severe"
  22,3,And some of the people argue about God without any knowledge and follow every rebellious devil
  22,4,"It is prescribed against him (Satan) that anyone who takes him as a friend, then he misguides him and guides him to punishment of the burning fire"
  22,5,"People, if you are in doubt about the resurrection, then (consider that) indeed We created you from dust, then from fertilized egg (Zygote), then from a (dangling, clinging, and leach like) blood clot, then from a piece of chewed flesh (embryo) formed and unformed in order to clarify for you (that We are capable of everything). And We settle what We want in the wombs for a limited period, then We bring you out as a baby, then you reach your full maturity (and strength), and some of you die and some of you are returned to the lowest part of life, so that they do not know anything after knowing (and they forget everything). And you see the earth barren (and lifeless), then when We send down the rain on it, it revives and grows and produces all types of beautiful (plants)"
