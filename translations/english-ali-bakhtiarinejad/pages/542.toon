  58,3,"And those who divorce their wives by declaring them as their mother, then they go back on what they said, should free a slave before touching each other. This is what you are advised to it. And God is well informed of what you do"
  58,4,"And if someone does not find (a slave) then fasting for two consecutive months before touching each other. And anyone who cannot (fast), then feeding sixty needy (ones). This is for you to believe in God and His messenger, and this is the limits set by God, and for the disbelievers there is a painful punishment"
