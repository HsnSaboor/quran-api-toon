quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,106,"If We invalidate (or cancel) any sign or make it forgotten, We bring one better than it or like it. Do you not know that God is capable of everything"
  2,107,"Did you not know that the rule of the skies and the earth belongs to God, and there is no supporter or helper for you other than God"
  2,108,Or do you want to ask (for something) from your messenger as it was asked from Moses before? Whoever changes the belief with the disbelief has lost the even (and straight) way
  2,109,Many of the people of the book want to turn you to disbelief after your belief and after the truth is clarified for them because of jealousy in themselves. Forgive and disregard (them) until God gives His order. God is capable of everything
  2,110,And perform the mandatory prayer and give to the mandatory charity. And whatever good you send ahead for yourselves you shall find it with God. God sees everything you do
  2,111,"And they said: no one ever enters the garden except anyone who is Jewish or Christians. This is their wish. Say: bring your proof if you are truthful"
  2,112,"Yes, anyone who submits his manner (of life) to God and is a good doer, then his reward is with his God, and he shall have no fear and no sadness"
