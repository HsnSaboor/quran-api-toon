quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When the sky is split
  82,2,and when the stars are scattered
  82,3,and when the seas are flooded (and overflow)
  82,4,and when the graves are turned upside down
  82,5,a person knows what he sent ahead and put off
  82,6,"Human being, what deceived you about your noble Master"
  82,7,"The One who created you, then He shaped you and balanced you"
  82,8,And He put you together in whatever form He wanted
  82,9,"No way, but you deny the Judgment"
  82,10,while indeed there are guardians over you
  82,11,nobles writing down
  82,12,who know whatever you do
  82,13,Indeed the good ones are in delight
  82,14,and indeed the immoral ones are in hellfire
  82,15,They enter (and burn in) there on the judgment day
  82,16,and they are not absent from it (beyond its reach)
  82,17,And do you know what the judgment day is
  82,18,"And again, do you know what the judgment day is"
  82,19,"A day when a person does not have the least bit of power for another one, and on that day the command (and judgment) belongs to God"
  83,1,Woe to those who give less than is due (the cheaters)
  83,2,"those who when they take a measure (or an amount) from people, they take it in full"
  83,3,"and when they give an amount to them or they weigh for them, they give less"
  83,4,Do they not think that indeed they will be raised
  83,5,for a great day
  83,6,A day when people stand before the Master of Human kind
