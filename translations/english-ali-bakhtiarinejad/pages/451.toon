quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"So they denied him, therefore they are brought (to the punishment)"
  37,128,except God's devoted servants
  37,129,And We left for him (a good name) among the later ones
  37,130,Peace (and well-being) on El Yasin (or Elias)
  37,131,Indeed that is how We reward the good doers
  37,132,Indeed he was among Our believing servants
  37,133,And indeed Lot was one of the messengers
  37,134,When We saved him and his family altogether
  37,135,Except an old woman (his wife who was) among those staying behind
  37,136,Then We destroyed the others
  37,137,And indeed you pass by them in the morning
  37,138,and by the night. Do you not understand
  37,139,And indeed Jonah was one of the messengers
  37,140,When he ran away to the loaded ship
  37,141,Then he drew lots and he was of those proven false
  37,142,"So the whale swallowed him, and he was to blame"
  37,143,And if he was not among those who glorify (God)
  37,144,he would have remained in its belly until the day of rising
  37,145,So We threw him on the bare shore while he was sick
  37,146,And We made a plant of squash grew over him
  37,147,And We sent him to a hundred thousand or more (people)
  37,148,"And they believed, so We let them enjoy for a while"
  37,149,"So ask their opinion: are the daughters for your Master, and the sons for them"
  37,150,"Or did We create the angels as females, and they were witnesses"
  37,151,"Know that, indeed they say as part of their lies"
  37,152,God fathered (children). And they are certainly liars
  37,153,Did He choose the daughters over the sons
