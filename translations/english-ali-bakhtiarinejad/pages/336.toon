quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,31,"Be monotheist for God, not associating (any partner) with Him. And whoever associates (any partner) with God, then it is as if he falls from the sky and the birds snatch him, or the wind blows him to a remote place"
  22,32,"That is how it is, and whoever honors God’s rituals then indeed it is from self control of the hearts"
  22,33,There are benefits in that (the livestock) for you for a limited period then their lawful place (of sacrifice) is at the ancient house (Ka’aba)
  22,34,"And for every community (of faith) We made a ritual (of sacrifice) so that they mention God’s name over what He provided them from the livestock animals. Your god is the One god, so submit to Him and give good news to those who humble themselves"
  22,35,"those whose hearts are scared when God is mentioned, and they are patient about what happens to them, and they perform the mandatory prayer, and they spend (in God's way) from what We provided them"
  22,36,"And We made the fat camel/cow as part of God's rituals (of pilgrimage) for you. There is goodness for you in them, so mention God’s name on them as they are lined up, then when they fall (on the ground) on their sides, eat from them and feed the poor and the beggar. That is how We put them under your control (and at you service), so you may be thankful"
  22,37,"Their meat and their blood would never reach God, but your self control reaches Him. That is how He put them under your control (and at your service) so that you magnify God for He guided you, and give good news to the good doers"
  22,38,"Indeed God defends those who believed, indeed God does not like any ungrateful traitor"
