quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  70,40,So I swear by the Master of the easts and the wests that We are certainly able
  70,41,"to substitute better than them, and We are not surpassed"
  70,42,So leave them talk uselessly and play until they meet their day which they are promised
  70,43,A day that they come out of the graves in a hurry as if they are rushing to an idol (or to a goal)
  70,44,"Lowering their eyes, humiliation overcomes them, that is the day that they were being promised"
  71,1,"Indeed We sent Noah to his people (telling him): warn your people before a painful punishment comes to them"
  71,2,"He said: my people, I am a clear warner for you"
  71,3,(warning you) that you should serve God and be cautious of Him and obey me
  71,4,"He forgives you of your sins and He postpones you for a limited period. Indeed when God's appointed time comes, it is not postponed if you knew"
  71,5,"He said: my Master, indeed I invited my people night and day"
  71,6,but my invitation only increased (their) running away
  71,7,"and indeed every time I invited them so that You forgive them, they put their fingers in their ears and covered themselves with their clothes and insisted and were extremely arrogant"
  71,8,So I invited them openly
  71,9,"then indeed I made it public for them, and confided in them secretly"
  71,10,"then I said: ask forgiveness from your Master, indeed He is very forgiving"
