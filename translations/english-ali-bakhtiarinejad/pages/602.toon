quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,For keeping/protection of the Quraish
  106,2,their keeping/protection for the winter and the summer journey
  106,3,so they should serve the Master of this house
  106,4,the One who fed them in hunger and made them safe from fear
  107,1,Did you see the one who denies the religion (or the judgment day)
  107,2,That is the one who pushes the orphan away
  107,3,and does not encourage feeding the poor
  107,4,So woe to those who perform mandatory prayer
  107,5,those who are forgetful of their mandatory prayer
  107,6,those who make a show (and pretend)
  107,7,and withhold the small kindnesses
  108,1,Indeed We gave you plenty
  108,2,So perform mandatory prayer and sacrifice for your Master
  108,3,"Indeed your hater, he is cut off (and is childless)"
