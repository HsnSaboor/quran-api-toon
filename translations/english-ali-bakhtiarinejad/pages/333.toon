  22,6,"That is because God is the truth, and He gives life to the dead, and He is capable of everything"

  22,8,And some people argue about God without any knowledge or any guidance or any enlightening book
  22,9,"Twisting his side (being arrogant) to misguide (people) away from God’s way. There is humiliation for him in this world, and We make him taste punishment of the burning on the resurrection day"
  22,10,"(He will be told): that is for what your hands sent ahead, and God is not unjust to His servants"
  22,11,"And some people serve God on edge (doubtfully), so if any good happens to him, he is content with it, and if a suffering happens to him, he turns on his face losing the world and the hereafter. That is the clear loss"
  22,12,"He calls on other than God, that which does not harm him and does not benefit him. That is the major error"
  22,13,"He calls on someone whose harm is closer than his benefit, certainly a bad supporter (and friend) and certainly a bad companion"
  22,14,Indeed God admits those who believed and did good works to gardens which rivers flows through them. Indeed God does what He wants
  22,15,"If anyone thinks that God never helps him (Muhammad) in this world and the hereafter, then let him stretch a rope to the ceiling (and hang himself with it), then let him cut it off and see whether his plan gets rid of whatever angers him"
