quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star when it goes down
  53,2,your companion is not misguided and he was not deceived
  53,3,And he does not speak from the desire
  53,4,It (Quran) is not but a revelation that is revealed
  53,5,The very powerful (Gabriel) taught him
  53,6,"being strong, he stood firmly"
  53,7,And he was at the higher horizon
  53,8,then he came closer and he came down
  53,9,until he was at a distance of two bows or closer
  53,10,then he revealed to His servant what he revealed
  53,11,His (the prophet’s) heart did not deny what he saw
  53,12,Do you argue with him about what he sees
  53,13,And he has certainly seen him in another descent
  53,14,By the Lote (Sidra) tree at the utmost boundary
  53,15,Next to it is garden of the residence
  53,16,When that which covers covered the Lote (Sidra) tree
  53,17,The eye did not turn aside and did not outreach
  53,18,He has certainly seen some of the great signs of His Master
  53,19,"What do you think of the Lat, the Uzza"
  53,20,"and Manat, the third one (of them)"
  53,21,Are the males for you and the females for Him
  53,22,That is an unfair division
  53,23,"They are only names which you and your fathers named it, whereas God did not send down any reason for it? They only follow the guess and what the souls desires, while the guidance has certainly come to them from their Master"
  53,24,Or does the human being have whatever he desire
  53,25,While the last (the hereafter) and the first (this world) belongs to God
  53,26,"And many angels are in the skies, that their mediation is of no benefit at all except after God gives permission for whom He wants and He approves"
