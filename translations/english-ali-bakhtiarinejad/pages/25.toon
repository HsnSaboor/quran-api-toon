quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,164,"Indeed for those who understand, there are signs in the creation of the skies and the earth, and the alternation (and the difference) between the day and the nights, and the ships that sail on the sea for benefit of the people, and what God sends down from the sky of rain to bring the land back to life after its death, and scattering all kinds of living creatures in it, and changing of the winds and the clouds under control between the sky and the earth"
  2,165,"And some of the people take equals besides God (to serve), loving them as they love God, while those who believed love God more. And if those who did wrong could see when they see the punishment, (they realize) that all the powers belong to God, and God is severe in punishment"
  2,166,When those who were followed disown those who followed (them) and they see the punishment and all their means cut off
  2,167,"and those who followed say that if we have another chance, then we disown them as they disowned us. That is how God shows them their deeds as regrets for them, and they will not get out of the fire"
  2,168,"People, eat from what is lawful and good on the earth, and do not follow Satan's footsteps as he is your clear (and obvious) enemy"
  2,169,"he only instructs you to the badness and the indecency, and to say what you do not know about God"
