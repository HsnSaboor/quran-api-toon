quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  29,46,"And do not argue with people of the book except by that which is best (in manner and in reasoning), except those of them who did wrong, and say: we believe in that which was sent down to us and was sent down to you, and our God and your god is One (and the same), and we submit to Him"
  29,47,"And that is how We sent down the book to you, so those whom We gave them the book believe in it, and some of these are those who believe in it, and no one rejects Our signs except the disbelievers"
  29,48,"And you were not reading any book and you did not write any book with your right hand before it (Quran), for in that case those who follow falsehood would have certainly doubted"
  29,49,"No, but it is clear signs in the mind of those who were given the knowledge. And no one rejects Our signs except the wrongdoers"
  29,50,"And they said: why was not any miracle sent down to him from his Master? Say: all the miracles are with God, and I am only a clear warner"
  29,51,Or was it not enough for them that We sent down to you the book that is read to them? Indeed there is a mercy and a reminder in that for people who believe
  29,52,"Say: God is enough as a witness between me and between you, He knows whatever is in the skies and the earth, and those who believed in the falsehood and disbelieved in God, they are the losers"
