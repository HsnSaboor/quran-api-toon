  9,124,"And whenever a chapter is sent down, then some among them say: this (chapter) increased belief of which one of you? As for those who believed, it increased their belief and they are glad"
  9,125,"And as for those who have a disease in their hearts, it added filth to their filthiness, and they died while they were disbelievers"
  9,126,Or do they not see that they are tested once or twice every year? Yet they do not repent and they do not take notice
  9,127,"And whenever a chapter is sent down, they look at each other (saying): does anyone see you? Then they turn away. God turned away their hearts because indeed they are a group who do not understand"
  9,128,"Certainly a messenger has come to you from among yourselves, what bothers you is difficult for him, (he is) anxious about you and is gentle and merciful to the believers"
  9,129,"If they turn away, then say: God is enough for me, there is no god except Him, I trust in Him and He is the Master of the great throne"
