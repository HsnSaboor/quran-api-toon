quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  54,7,"With their eyes looking down (in humiliation), they come out of their graves as if they were spreading locusts"
  54,8,"Rushing toward the caller, the disbelievers say: this is a difficult day"
  54,9,"People of Noah denied before them, and they denied Our servant (Noah) and they said a madman, and he was outcast"
  54,10,"So he called on his Master: I am defeated, so help"
  54,11,So We opened the gates of the sky with downpour of water
  54,12,And We gushed out springs from the earth. The waters joined for a matter that was destined (the flood)
  54,13,And We carried him on (the Ark) having timbers and nails
  54,14,"It sailed under Our eyes, a reward for him who was rejected (Noah)"
  54,15,"And We have certainly left it as a sign, so does anyone take notice"
  54,16,So how were My punishment and My warnings
  54,17,"And We have certainly made the Quran easy to understand, so does anyone take notice"
  54,18,"Aad denied, so how were My punishment and My warnings"
  54,19,Indeed We sent a continuous ice cold wind upon them on a miserable day
  54,20,knocking the people over as if they were uprooted trunks of a palm tree
  54,21,So how were My punishment and My warnings
  54,22,"And We have certainly made the Quran easy to understand, so does anyone take notice"
  54,23,Thamud denied the warnings
  54,24,"And they said: should we follow him, a single human being among us? Then indeed we are in error and madness"
  54,25,"Is the reminder only given to him among us? No, he is a rude liar"
  54,26,Tomorrow they are going to know who the rude liar is
  54,27,"Indeed We are senders of the female camel as a test for them, so watch them and be patient"
