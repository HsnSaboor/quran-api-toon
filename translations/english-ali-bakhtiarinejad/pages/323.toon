quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  21,11,And We crushed many towns that were wrongdoers and We gave rise to other people after them
  21,12,"And when they felt Our punishment, they immediately run away from it"
  21,13,"Do not run away, and return to what you were delighted in it and to your homes, so that you may be questioned"
  21,14,"They said: woe to us, we were wrongdoers"
  21,15,And that call of them did not stop until We made them extinct as a mowed down field
  21,16,And We did not create the skies and the earth and what is between them playing around
  21,17,"If We wanted to take a hobby, We would have taken it from what is with Us, if We were doers"
  21,18,"No, but We throw the truth over the falsehood and it destroys it, and then it dies out. And woe to you for what you describe"
  21,19,"And everyone in the skies and the earth belongs to Him, and those with Him are not arrogant about serving Him, and they do not get tired"
  21,20,"They glorify (Him) night and day, and they do not slack off"
  21,21,Or did they take gods from the earth that they raise (the dead)
  21,22,"If there were gods in them (the skies and the earth) other than God, they would certainly corrupt them both. Glory to God, Master of the throne, (He is flawless) of what they describe"
  21,23,"He is not questioned about what He does, while they are questioned"
  21,24,"Or did they take gods other than Him? Say: bring your proof, this is the message of those with me and the message of those before me. But most of them do not know the truth and they turn away"
