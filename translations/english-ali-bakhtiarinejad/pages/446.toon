quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,1,By those who lined up in rows
  37,2,and those who drive away (evil or clouds) vigorously
  37,3,and those reading a reminder
  37,4,that your god is certainly One
  37,5,"Master of the skies and the earth and what is between them, and Master of the easts"
  37,6,Indeed We beautified the sky of the world with beauty of the stars
  37,7,and as a guard against every defiant devil
  37,8,"They would not listen to the high assembly, for they are pelted from every side"
  37,9,"chased away, and they have an everlasting punishment"
  37,10,"Except someone who snatches (and overhears) the snatch (the word), then a piercing shooting flame follows him"
  37,11,"So ask their opinion: are they a harder creation or those We created (such as angels and the universe)? Indeed We created them from sticky clay"
  37,12,"No, but you wonder while they ridicule"
  37,13,"And when they are reminded, they do not take notice"
  37,14,And when they see a sign they ridicule
  37,15,"and they say: this is only an obvious magic"
  37,16,are we raised after when we are dead and turned into dust and bones
  37,17,or our forefathers
  37,18,"Say: yes, and you are humiliated"
  37,19,"It is only a single shout, and then they see"
  37,20,"and they say: woe to us, this is the judgment day"
  37,21,"This is the day of separation/decision, the one that you used to deny it"
  37,22,Gather those who did wrong and their types and what they used to serve
  37,23,"other than God, and lead them to path of the hellfire"
  37,24,"And stop them (on the way), indeed they are questioned (and are responsible)"
