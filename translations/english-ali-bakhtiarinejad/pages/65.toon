quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,116,"Indeed those who disbelieved, their wealth and their children will never be of any use to them against God, and they are inhabitants of the fire remaining in there forever"
  3,117,"The example of what they spend (in God's way) in this world's life is like an ice cold wind that hits harvest of a group who wronged themselves and destroys it. God did not wrong them, but they wrong themselves"
  3,118,"You who believe, do not take any confidant besides yourselves, as they will not stop to drive you crazy, and they wish you what agonizes you, hatred has appeared from (words of) their mouths , and what their chests hides is even greater. We have clarified Our signs for you, if you understand"
  3,119,"You love them while they do not love you, and you believe in all the books (while they do not). When they meet you they say: we believed. And when they are alone, they bite their fingertips because of the anger for you. Say: die with your anger. God knows what is inside the chests"
  3,120,"If any good happens to you it upsets them and when any bad happens to you, they enjoy it. And if you persevere and control yourselves, their plots does not cause the least bit of harm to you. God surrounds what they do"
  3,121,And (remember) when you left your family early in the morning to assign the positions of the believers for the war (battle of Ohod). God hears all and knows all
