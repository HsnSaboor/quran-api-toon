quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,28,"And inform them that the water is shared between them, and each drinking is to be attended"
  54,29,"But they called their companion, and he took (a knife) and killed (her)"
  54,30,So how were My punishment and My warnings
  54,31,Indeed We sent a single awesome roar upon them and they became like dried broken straws of a barn maker
  54,32,"And We have certainly made the Quran easy to understand, so does anyone take notice"
  54,33,People of Lot denied the warnings
  54,34,"Indeed We sent a sandstorm upon them, except Lot’s family whom We saved them by dawn"
  54,35,a favor from Us. That is how We reward anyone who thanks
  54,36,"And he has certainly warned them of Our assault, but they doubted the warnings"
  54,37,"And they have certainly demanded his guest from him, so We blinded their eyes, so taste My punishment and My warnings"
  54,38,And certainly a lasting punishment took them by early morning
  54,39,So taste My punishment and My warnings
  54,40,"And We have certainly made the Quran easy to understand, so does anyone take notice"
  54,41,And the warners have certainly come to Pharaoh’s people
  54,42,"They denied all Our signs, so We took them (into punishment), a powerful and awesome taking"
  54,43,"Are your disbelievers better than them, or is there immunity for you in the scriptures"
  54,44,Or do they say we are united and victorious
  54,45,They are all going to be defeated and turn their backs (running away)
  54,46,"No, the hour is their appointment time, and the hour is more awful and bitterer (than this world’s punishment)"
  54,47,Indeed the guilty ones are in error and madness
  54,48,"A day when they are dragged into the fire on their faces (they are told): taste the touch of hell"
  54,49,Indeed We created everything in correct proportion
