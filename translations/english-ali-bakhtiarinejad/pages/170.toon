quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  7,156,"And prescribe good in this world and in the hereafter for us, for we turned to You. He (God) said: I inflict My punishment on whomever I want, and My mercy includes everything, so I am going to prescribe it for those who control themselves and give the mandatory charity and those who believe in Our signs"
  7,157,"Those who follow the messenger (Muhammad), the illiterate prophet, the one they find him written in the Torah and the Gospel that is with them, he instructs them to what is right and prohibits them from what is wrong, and he makes the good thing lawful for them and prohibits them from the bad things, and he removes their burden and the shackles that is on them from them. So those who believed in him and assisted him and helped him and followed the light (Quran) that was sent with him, they are the successful ones"
  7,158,"Say: people, I am God's messenger to all of you, the One that the rule of the skies and the earth belongs to Him, there is no god except Him, He gives life and causes death. So believe in God and His messenger, the illiterate prophet, the one who believes in God and His words, and follow Him/him so that you may be guided"
  7,159,"And a group of Moses’ people guide to the truth, and they carry out justice with that"
