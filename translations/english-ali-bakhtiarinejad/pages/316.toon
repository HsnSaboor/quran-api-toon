quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  20,65,"They said: Moses, do you throw or are we to throw first"
  20,66,"He said: no, you throw (first). So suddenly their ropes and their canes appeared to him as if they were moving fast because of their magic"
  20,67,Then Moses had a sensation of fear in himself
  20,68,"We said: do not fear, indeed you are superior"
  20,69,"and throw down what is in your right hand (your cane), it swallows what they produced. Indeed what they produced is only a magician’s trick, and the magician does not succeed wherever he goes"
  20,70,"So the magicians fell prostrating (showing humbleness), and they said: we believed in the Master of Aaron and Moses"
  20,71,"He (Pharaoh) said: did you believe in Him/him before I give you permission? Indeed he is your senior, the one who taught you the magic, I shall cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I shall crucify you on the trunks of the palm tree, and you shall know punishment of which one of us is more severe and more lasting"
  20,72,"They (the magicians) said: we never prefer you to what came to us from the clear proofs (evidences) and to the One who created us, so decide what you want to decide, for you only decide in this world’s life"
  20,73,"Indeed we believed in our Master so that He may forgive us our faults and the magic that you forced us to it, and God is better and more lasting"
  20,74,"Indeed anyone who comes to his Master guilty, then indeed hell is for him, and he does not die in it and he does not live"
  20,75,And anyone who comes to Him as a believer who has done good works then they have high rank (and status)
  20,76,"Eternal gardens which rivers flow through them, remaining in there forever, and that is reward of anyone who purifies (and absolves)"
