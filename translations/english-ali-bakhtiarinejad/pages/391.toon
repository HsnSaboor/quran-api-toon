quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,44,And you were not on the western side (of the mountain) when We issued the order to Moses and you were not of the witnesses
  28,45,"And We created generations (after Moses) and life was lengthened for them. And you were not staying among people of Midian to read Our signs to them, but We are the sender (of messengers)"
  28,46,"And you were not on the side of the mountain (Mount Sinai) when We called (Moses), but this is a mercy from your Master to warn a people whom a warner did not come to them before you, so they may take notice"
  28,47,"And if they suffer a tragedy because of what their hands sent ahead (what they did), then they say: our Master, why did You not send us a messenger so we follow Your signs and we become of the believers"
  28,48,"Then when the truth came to them from Us, they said: why was he not given (miracles) like what Moses was given? Did they not previously disbelieve in what was given to Moses? They said: two magic (Torah and Quran) backing each other up. And they said: indeed we are disbelievers to all"
  28,49,"Say: if you are truthful, then bring a book from God which is a better guide than them that I follow it, if you are truthful"
  28,50,"So if they did not answer you, then know that they only follow their desires (and opinions). And who is more mistaken than someone who follows his desire (and opinion) without guidance from God? Indeed God does not guide the wrongdoing people"
