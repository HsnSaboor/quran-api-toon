  18,21,"And that is how We made (others) acquainted with them, so that they know that God’s promise is true and that there is no doubt about the hour. When they disputed about their affair among themselves, they said: build a structure over them, their Master knows better about them. Those who won about their affair said: we shall build a temple over them"
  18,22,"(Some) are going to say: three, their fourth being their dog. While (others) say: five, their sixth being their dog. Throwing stone in the dark, and (others) say: seven, their eight being their dog. Say: my Master knows their number better as only a few know them (their number), so do not argue about them except in a superficial argument, and do not ask opinion of any of them about them"
  18,23,"And do not say about anything: I will do that tomorrow"

  18,27,"And read what was revealed to you from your Master’s book. No one can change His words, and you never find any refuge other than Him"
