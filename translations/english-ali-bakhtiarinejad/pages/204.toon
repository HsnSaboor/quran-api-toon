quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,107,"And (there are) those who built a mosque for harm and disbelief and for division among the believers, and as an outpost for those who previously fought God and His messenger, and they swear that we only wish the best, but God testifies that they are liars"
  9,108,"Never stand in there, as a mosque that is built based on the righteousness from the first day deserves more that you stand in there, as there are men in it who like to be cleansed, and God loves those who purify themselves"
  9,109,Is one who based his foundation on being cautious of God and His pleasure better or one who based his foundation on the edge of a cliff that is about to crumble and is falling down into fire of hell with him? God does not guide the wrongdoing people
  9,110,"Their foundation that they built is always a source of doubt in their hearts, until their hearts are torn into pieces. God is knowledgeable and wise"
  9,111,"Indeed God purchased from the believers their lives and their possessions for the garden that is for them. They fight in God's way, and they kill and are killed. This is a true promise upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Quran. And who fulfills his promise better than God? So, be glad with your trade that you bargained with it, that is the great victory"
