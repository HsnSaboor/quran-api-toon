quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,39,"(Fighting) is permitted for those who are attacked (and war is waged against them), because they are wronged, and God is certainly able to help them (to victory)"
  22,40,"those who were driven out of their home unjustly, only because they said: our Master is God. If God had not repelled some people by others, then monasteries and churches and synagogues and mosques in which God’s name is mentioned often, would have been demolished. And God shall help anyone who helps Him. Indeed God is strong and powerful"
  22,41,(They are) those who perform the mandatory prayer and give to the mandatory charity and instruct to the right (acceptable) and prohibit from the wrong (unacceptable) if We make them powerful on the earth. And the end of all affairs belongs to God
  22,42,"And if they deny you, people of Noah and Aad and Thamud also denied (their prophets) before them"
  22,43,and (so did) people of Abraham and people of Lot
  22,44,"and inhabitant of Midian (people of Shu'aib), and Moses was also denied, so I gave the disbelievers a break then I took them, so how was My rejection (and punishment)"
  22,45,"And how many a town did We destroy while it was (filled with) wrongdoer, then it (was ruined and) fell on its roofs and abandoned wells and towering castles"
  22,46,"Did they not travel in the land, so that they have hearts to understand with it or ears to hear with it? Indeed the eyes are not blind, but the hearts which are in the chests are blind"
