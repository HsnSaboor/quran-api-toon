quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  4,20,"If you decide to replace a wife in lieu of a wife, and you gave one of them lots of valuables, then do not take anything from her. Do you take it with a false accusation and an obvious sin"
  4,21,And how do you take it while you have gone into each other (and had sex) and they took a strong commitment (marriage contract) from you
  4,22,"Do not marry what your fathers married among the women (their ex-wives) except what has passed, indeed it is indecent and disgusting and a bad way"
  4,23,"Forbidden to you (for marriage) are your mothers, and daughters, and sisters, and sisters of your fathers, and sisters of your mothers, and daughters of your brothers, and daughters of your sisters, and your stepmothers who nursed you, and your stepsisters by nursing, and mothers of your wives, and your stepdaughters in your guardianship from you wives whom you had sex with them but if you did not have sex with them then there is no blame on you, and the wives of your sons from your backs (your own sons not your stepsons), and two sisters together (at the same time), except what has passed. God is forgiving and merciful"
