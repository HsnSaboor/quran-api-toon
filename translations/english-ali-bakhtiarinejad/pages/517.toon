quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  49,12,"You who believe, avoid most of the suspicions, as indeed some suspicions are sin, and do not snoop, and do not defame/backbite each other, for would any one of you like to eat his dead brother’s flesh? You would hate it. And be cautious of God. Indeed God is acceptor of repentance and merciful"
  49,13,"People, indeed We created you from a male and a female, and We made you into races (and nations) and tribes so that you know each other. Indeed the more honorable of you before God are those of you having most self control (against unlawful desires and sins). Indeed God is knowledgeable and well informed"
  49,14,"The desert Arabs said: we believe. Say: you did not believe, but say we surrendered (to you, and not yet to God), while the belief has not yet entered your hearts. And if you obey God and His messenger, He would not reduce anything from your works. God is forgiving and merciful"
  49,15,"Indeed the believers are those who believed in God and His messenger, then they did not doubt and they tried hard with their possessions and their lives in God’s way. They are the truthful ones"
  49,16,"Say: do you inform God about your way of life while God knows whatever is in the skies and whatever is on the earth? And God knows everything"
  49,17,"They consider it a favor to you that they submitted, say: do not consider your submission as a favor to me, but God favored you to guide you to the belief, if you are truthful"
  49,18,Indeed God knows the unseen (and secrets) of the skies and the earth. And God sees whatever you do
