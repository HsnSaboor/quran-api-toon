quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  43,23,"And the same way, We did not send any town anyone as a warner before you, unless its rich (and wealthy) said: we found our fathers on a course, and we are following their footsteps"
  43,24,"He (the warner) said: even if I have brought you a better guidance than what you found your fathers upon it? They said: we disbelieve in what you were sent with it"
  43,25,"Then We took revenge from them, so see what the end of those who denied was"
  43,26,"And (remember) when Abraham told his father and his people: I am free of what you serve"
  43,27,"except the One who created me, indeed He is going to guide me"
  43,28,And he made it a lasting word among his descendants so that they may return (to God)
  43,29,"No, but I made these and their fathers enjoy until the truth and a clarifying messenger came to them"
  43,30,"And when the truth came to them, they said: this is a magic and we are disbelievers in it"
  43,31,"And they said: why this Quran was not sent down to a great man from the two towns (Mecca and Taif)"
  43,32,Do they divide up (and distribute) your Master’s mercy? We divided their livelihood (and wealth) between them in this world’s life. And We raised some of them above the others in ranks so that some of them take the others into service. And your Master’s mercy is better than what they accumulate
  43,33,"And if it was not that the people would become a single community (of disbelievers), We would have made houses, for anyone who disbelieves in the beneficent, with silver roofs and (silver) ladders to go up on it"
