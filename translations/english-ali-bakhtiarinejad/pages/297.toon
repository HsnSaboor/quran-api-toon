quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,28,"And be patient with those who call on their Master in the morning and the evening, looking for His attention, and do not overlook them wanting luxury of this world’s life, and do not obey anyone whom We made his heart pay no attention to remembering Us and followed his desires and he is excessive in his affairs"
  18,29,"And say: the truth is from your Master, so anyone who wants then let him believe and anyone who wants then let him disbelieve. Indeed We prepared a fire for the wrongdoers that its canopy surrounds them. And if they ask for help, they will be helped with water like melted metal (or burning oil) that burns the faces. What a bad drink and a bad resting place"
  18,30,"Indeed those who believed and did good works, (know that) We would not waste the reward of anyone who does good work"
  18,31,"Eternal gardens are for them, which rivers flow through them, they are adorned with bracelets of gold in it and they wear clothes of green fine silk and heavy silk (brocade), leaning on sofas in it. What a good reward and a good resting place"
  18,32,And give them an example of two men. We gave two gardens of grapes to one of them and We enclosed them with date palms and We placed a plantation between them
  18,33,"Both gardens yielded their produce, and did not fail in that at all, and We made a river flow through them"
  18,34,"And (their) produce was for him. Then he said to his friend while talking to him: I am more wealthy than you and I am more powerful in (number of) men"
