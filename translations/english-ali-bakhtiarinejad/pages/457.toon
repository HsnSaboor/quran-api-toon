  38,62,"And they say: what is with us, we do not see men whom we used to count them among the bad ones"
  38,63,"Did we make fun of them (by mistake), or did the eyes overlook (and missed) them"
  38,64,"Indeed that, dispute of the people of fire, is true"
  38,65,"Say: I am only a warner, and there is no god except God, the one, the supreme (and dominant)"
  38,66,"the Master of the skies and the earth and whatever is between them, the powerful, the forgiver"
  38,67,"Say: it is a great news"
  38,68,that you turn away from it
  38,69,I have no knowledge of the high assembly (angels) when they disputed

  38,71,"When your Master said to the angels: I am creator of a human being from clay"
