quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Did We not create you from despicable water
  77,21,Then We placed it in a safe quarter (the womb)
  77,22,for a known period
  77,23,"So We are able, and We are very capable"
  77,24,Woe to the deniers on that day
  77,25,Did We not make the earth a holder
  77,26,(for) living and dead
  77,27,"And We placed towering mountains in it, and We gave you sweet fresh water to drink"
  77,28,Woe to the deniers on that day
  77,29,"(They will be told): proceed to what you were denying it"
  77,30,proceed to a three pronged shadow (of smoke)
  77,31,that is not a shade and is of no use against the flame
  77,32,which indeed it shoots up sparks like towers
  77,33,as if they were yellow camels
  77,34,Woe to the deniers on that day
  77,35,This is a day that they do not speak
  77,36,and it is not permitted for them to apologize
  77,37,Woe to the deniers on that day
  77,38,"This is the day of separation/decision, We assemble you and the earlier ones"
  77,39,"So if you have a plot (trick), then plot it"
  77,40,Woe to the deniers on that day
  77,41,Indeed those who control themselves are in shades and springs
  77,42,and fruits of whatever they desire
  77,43,Eat and drink joyfully for what you used to do
  77,44,Indeed that is how We reward the good doers
  77,45,Woe to the deniers on that day
  77,46,"Eat and enjoy a little, you are indeed the guilty ones"
  77,47,Woe to the deniers on that day
  77,48,"And when they are told to bow down, they do not bow down"
  77,49,Woe to the deniers on that day
  77,50,So in what saying do they believe after it (Quran)
