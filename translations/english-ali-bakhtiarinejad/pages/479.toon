quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  41,21,"And they say to their skins: why did you testify against us? They (their skins) say: God made us speak, the One who made everything speak, and He created you the first time and you are returned to Him"
  41,22,"You were not hiding (your sins) that your ears and your eyes and your skins do not testify against you (because you did not believe they will), but you assumed that God does not know most of what you do"
  41,23,"And that thinking of yours, which you assumed about your Master, destroyed you and so you became of the losers"
  41,24,"And if they are patient, then (they find out that) the fire is a place for them, and if they want to plea (to appease God), they are not of those whose plea is accepted"
  41,25,"And We assigned companions for them who made what is in front of them and what is behind them look beautiful to them, and the word (of punishment) about groups of Jinn and humans who passed away before them became due on them, indeed they were losers"
  41,26,"And those who disbelieved said: do not listen to this Quran, and talk nonsense in it (when it is read) so that you may win"
  41,27,"And We shall make those who disbelieved taste a severe punishment, and We shall punish them for the worst of what they used to do"
  41,28,"That is punishment of God’s enemies, the fire, they have the eternal home in it, as a reward because they were rejecting Our signs"
  41,29,"And those who disbelieved say: our Master, show us those among Jinn and humans who misguided us so that we put them under our feet (and stomp on them) so that they become of the lowest ones"
