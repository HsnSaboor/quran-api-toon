quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,32,"Because of that, We prescribed to children of Israel that: anyone who kills a person, other than for (murdering) a person or for corruption on the earth, then it is like he killed all the people, and anyone who saves it then it is like he saved the life of all the people. And Our messengers have certainly brought them the clear proofs, then indeed many of them were excessive on the earth after that"
  5,33,"The only punishment of those who wage war against God and His messenger spreading corruption in the land is to be killed or to be crucified or have their hands and feet cut off from the opposite side or be sent to exile from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and they have great punishment in the hereafter"
  5,34,"except those who repented before you overpower them, and know that God is indeed forgiving and merciful"
  5,35,"You who believe, be cautious of God and look for the mean toward Him and try hard in His way so you may be successful"
  5,36,"If those who disbelieved had all that is on the earth and the like of it with it, in order to ransom with it from the punishment of the resurrection day, it will not be accepted from them and a painful punishment is for them"
