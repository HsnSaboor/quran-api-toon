quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"Say: does any of your partners (of God) initiate the creation then brings it back? Say: God initiates the creation and then brings it back, so how do you deviate"
  10,35,"Say: does any of your partners (of God) guides to the truth? Say: God guides to the truth, is one who guides to the truth more deserving to be followed or one who does not guide (or does not find the way) unless he is guided, then what is the matter with you? What is your opinion"
  10,36,And most of them only follow guess. Indeed the guess has no use against the truth at all. God knows what they do
  10,37,"And this Quran is not made up by anyone other than God, and it is a confirmation of what is before it, and an explanation of the book, no doubt about it (that it is) from the Master of Human kind"
  10,38,"Or do they say: he (Muhammad) made it up? Say: if you are truthful, then bring a chapter like it, and call on anyone you can (for help) other than God"
  10,39,"No, but they denied that which they did not have knowledge of it, and its interpretation (of its events) have not come to them. Those before them also denied like that. So see what the end of the wrongdoers was"
  10,40,"And some of them believe in it and some of them do not believe in it, and Your Master best knows the corruptors"
  10,41,"And if they denied you, then say: my work is for me and your work is for you, you are clear of what I do and I am clear of what you do"
  10,42,And some of them listen to you. Can you make the deaf listen even though they do not understand
