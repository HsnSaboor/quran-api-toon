quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"The knowledge of the hour is referred to Him. And no fruit come out of its coverings, and no female gets pregnant and gives birth without His knowledge. And on a day that He calls them (saying): where are My associates? They say: we notified You that there is no witness among us"
  41,48,"And what they used to call on in the past abandoned them, and they realize that there is no way (or place) of escape for them"
  41,49,"The human being does not get tired of praying for the good (things), but if the badness touches him then he becomes hopeless and discouraged"
  41,50,"And if We make him taste of a mercy from Us after harm touches him, he shall say: this is because of me, and I do not think that the hour is established, and if I am returned to my Master, indeed there is better (things) for me with Him. We shall inform those who disbelieved of what they did, and We shall make them taste from a severe punishment"
  41,51,"And when We favor upon the human being, he turns away and moves away to his side, and when the badness touches him then he has a lengthy prayer"
  41,52,"Say: what do you think if it (Quran) is from God and you disbelieve in it, who is more mistaken than someone who is in extreme opposition (to it)"
  41,53,We are going to show them Our signs in the horizons (of universe) and in themselves until it is clarified for them that He is the truth. Or is it not enough that your Master is indeed a witness over everything
  41,54,Know that indeed they are in doubt about meeting their Master. Know that indeed He surrounds everything
