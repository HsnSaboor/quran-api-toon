  24,14,"And if it was not for God’s grace and mercy on you in this world and in the hereafter, a great punishment would have touched you because of what you engaged in it"
  24,15,"When you receive it through each other’s tongues and you say with your mouths what you have no knowledge of it, and you think it is insignificant, while it is significant in God's view"
  24,16,"And whey when you heard it, you did not say: it is not for us to speak of this, You are flawless, this is a great slander"

  24,20,"And if it was not for God’s grace and mercy on you, (you would be in trouble) and indeed God is gentle and merciful"
