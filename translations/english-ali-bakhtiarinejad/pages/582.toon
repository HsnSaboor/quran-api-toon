quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,What do they ask each other about
  78,2,About the great news
  78,3,The one that they disagree about it
  78,4,"No way, they are going to know"
  78,5,"Then, no way, they are going to know"
  78,6,Did We not make the earth a bed (to rest on)
  78,7,and the mountains as pins
  78,8,And We created you in pairs
  78,9,And We made your sleep as a rest
  78,10,And We made the night as a cover
  78,11,And We made the day as a livelihood (to earn a living)
  78,12,And We built seven stable (skies) above you
  78,13,And We made (sun) a glowing lamp
  78,14,And We sent down plenty of rain from the dense clouds
  78,15,that We bring out with it grain and plant
  78,16,and dense (and luxurious) gardens
  78,17,Indeed the day of separation/decision is an appointed time
  78,18,A day when the trumpet is blown and you come in bunches
  78,19,And the sky is opened and becomes gates
  78,20,and the mountains are moved and become a mirage
  78,21,Indeed hell is an ambush
  78,22,as a place of return for the rebellious ones
  78,23,staying in it for a long time
  78,24,They do not taste anything cool or any drink in it
  78,25,except boiling water and pus
  78,26,An appropriate punishment
  78,27,They were not expecting an accounting
  78,28,and they strongly denied Our signs
  78,29,while We keep track of everything in a book
  78,30,"So taste (the punishment), for We never add anything to you except punishment"
