quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,25,What is with you that you do not help each other
  37,26,"No, but today they are surrendered"
  37,27,And they turn to each other asking one another
  37,28,"they say: indeed you were coming to us from the right (to seduce us)"
  37,29,"They (the others) say: no, but you were not believers"
  37,30,"and there was no authority for us over you, but you were rebellious people"
  37,31,"so the word of our Master is justified against us, indeed we will taste (the punishment)"
  37,32,"So we misled you, as we were indeed misled"
  37,33,And indeed on that day they are partners in the punishment
  37,34,Indeed that is what We do to the guilty ones
  37,35,"Indeed when it was said to them there is no god except God, they were arrogant"
  37,36,"And they would say: should we give up our gods for a mad poet"
  37,37,"No, but he brought the truth and confirmed the messengers (before him)"

  37,42,"(all kind of) fruits, and they are honored"
  37,43,in gardens of the delight
  37,44,on sofas facing each other
  37,45,A cup of spring water is circulated among them
  37,46,white and delicious for the drinkers
  37,47,"no sickness in it, and they do not get exhausted (and drunk) from it"
  37,48,"And there are girls with them, with restrained glances and beautiful eyes"
  37,49,as if they were protected eggs
  37,50,And they turn to each other asking one another
  37,51,"A talker among them say: indeed I had a close friend"
