  7,188,"Say: I do not have power of any benefit or any harm for myself, except what God wants, and if I knew the unseen, I would want a lot of the good things, and nothing bad would touch me, I am only a warner and a giver of good news for people who believe"
  7,189,"He is the One who created you from a single being, and He made its spouse from it to find tranquility in it. So when he covered her (and had intercourse with her), she carried a light load and went on with it, then when it became heavy, they called on God their Master: if You give us a good child, we shall be of the thankful ones"
  7,190,"But when God gave them a good child, they set up partners for Him in what He gave them. God is above what they associate (with Him)"

  7,194,"Those whom you call on besides God are servants like you, so call on them and they should answer you if you are truthful"
  7,195,"Do they have feet to walk with them, or do they have hands to grab with them, or do they have eyes to see with them, or do they have ears to hear with them? Say: call on your associates (for God), then plot against me and do not wait"
