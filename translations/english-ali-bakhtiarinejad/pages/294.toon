quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  18,5,"They have no knowledge of it, and neither did their fathers. Word coming out of their mouths is serious. They only say a lie"
  18,6,So you may kill yourself from sorrow over their actions if they do not believe in this saying
  18,7,"And We made all that is on the earth as decoration for it, so that We test them as to which one of them does better work"
  18,8,"And indeed We make whatever is on it, a barren wasteland"
  18,9,Did you think that inhabitants of the cave and the inscription were among Our amazing signs
  18,10,"When the youths took shelter in the cave then they said: our Master, give us mercy form You and arrange a sensible conduct for us in our affairs"
  18,11,And We sealed their ears (and made them sleep) in the cave for a number of years
  18,12,"Then We woke them up, so that We know which of the two groups was better at counting the time they stayed (asleep)"
  18,13,We tell you their story in truth. Indeed they were youths who believed in their Master and We increased their guidance
  18,14,"And We strengthened their hearts with patience when they stood up, and they said: our Master is Master of the skies and the earth, we never call on any god other than Him, (for if we did) then we have certainly said an outrageous (word)"
  18,15,"These are our people who took god other than Him, why do they not bring a clear reason for them? Who is more wrong than someone who makes up a lie and attributes it to God"
