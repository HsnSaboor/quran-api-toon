quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  60,12,"Prophet, when the believing women come to you pledging to you that they will not associate anything with God, and they will not steal, and they will not commit adultery (and fornication), and they will not kill their children, and they will not bring false accusation that they made up between their hands and their feet (by falsely claiming that their husband or someone else is the father of their child), and they will not disobey you in what is right, then accept their pledge and ask God for their forgiveness. God is indeed forgiving and merciful"
  60,13,"You who believe, do not make friends with people whom God’s anger is upon them, for they have lost hope of the hereafter as the disbelievers lost hope of (return of) inhabitants of the graves"
  61,1,"Whatever is in the skies and whatever is on the earth glorify God, and He is the powerful, the wise"

  61,5,"And when Moses said to his people: my people, why do you harass me while you have known that I am God's messenger to you? So when they deviated, God made their hearts deviate. And God does not guide the disobedient people"
