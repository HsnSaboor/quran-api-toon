quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,"It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, that when God and His messenger decided on a matter, to have a choice in their matter. And whoever disobeys God and His messenger has certainly erred, an obvious error"
  33,37,"And (remember) when you said to the one whom God favored upon him and you favored upon him: keep your wife for yourself, and be cautious of God. And you hid in yourself what God was to disclose it. And you feared people, while God is more deserving that you fear Him. So when Zaid finished with her (and divorced her), We married her to you so that there would be no difficulty for the believers about (marrying) wives of their adopted sons when they are finished with them (and have divorced them). And God’s command is to be done"
  33,38,There is no difficulty on the prophet about (doing) what God mandated to him. This is God’s way about those who passed away in the past. And God’s command is a mandated destiny
  33,39,"Those who preach God’s message and fear Him and do not fear anyone except God, (they know that) God is enough for accounting"
  33,40,"Muhammad is not father of any of your men, but (he is) God’s messenger and the seal (and the last) of the prophets. And God knows everything"
  33,41,"You who believe, remember God, remembering often"
  33,42,and glorify Him morning and afternoon
  33,43,He is the One who sends blessings to you and (so do) His angles to bring you out of the darkness to the light. And He is merciful to the believers
