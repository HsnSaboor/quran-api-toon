  35,4,"And if they deny you, messengers before you were also denied. And all the affairs are returned to God"
  35,5,"People, indeed God’s promise is true, so do not let this world’s life deceive you, and do not let the deceiver (Satan) deceive you about God"
  35,6,"Indeed Satan is your enemy, so take him as an enemy. He only invites his party so that they become among inhabitants of the burning fire"
  35,7,"Those who disbelieved have a severe punishment, and those who believed and did good works have forgiveness and a great reward"
  35,8,"Is someone whose bad work was decorated for him to see it as good (like someone who is not like that)? For indeed God misguides anyone He wants and guides anyone He wants, so do not kill yourself by regret about them. Indeed God knows what they do"
  35,9,"God is the One who sent the winds, then they put cloud in motion, then We drive it to a dead land and with it We bring the earth back to life after its death. The resurrection is like that"
  35,10,"Anyone who wants the power, (should know that) all the power belongs to God, the good talk goes up to Him, and the good work raises it up. And those who plot the bad (things) have a severe punishment, and their plot leads to nothing"
  35,11,"And God created you from dust, then from fertilized egg, then He made you couples. And no female carries (and gets pregnant) and do not gives birth without His knowledge. And anyone who is given life is not given a long life and his life is not shortened unless it is (recorded) in a book. Indeed that is easy for God"
