quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  20,38,when We revealed to your mother what was revealed
  20,39,"that throw him in the box, then throw it in the sea/river, then the sea/river should throw it on the shore, and an enemy of Me and an enemy of him takes him. And I threw My affection on you so that you are brought up under My eye (and My observation)"
  20,40,"(Remember) when your sister walked (to them) and said: should I show you someone to take care of him? So We returned you to your mother so that her eyes are cooled (and she is cheered up) and she would not be sad. And you killed a person, then We saved you from the sadness and We tested you with tests. Then you stayed with people of Midian (people of Shu'aib) for years, then you came as destined, Moses"
  20,41,And I made you (and chose you) for Myself (to communicate My message to children of Israel and Pharaoh)
  20,42,You and your brother go with My miracles and do not slack off in remembering Me
  20,43,"Both of you go to Pharaoh, indeed he rebelled"
  20,44,"Then say to him in gentle words, so that he may take notice or fear"
  20,45,"They said: our Master, we fear that he goes too far against us (and he rushes to punish us) or that he rebels"
  20,46,"He (God) said: do not fear, indeed I am with you, I hear and I see"
  20,47,"So you two go to him and say: we are messengers of your Master, so send the children of Israel with us and do not punish them, we have brought you a miracle from your Master, and peace (and well-being) on anyone who follows the guidance"
  20,48,Indeed it has been revealed to us that the punishment is on anyone who denies and turns away
  20,49,"He said: Moses, who is your Master"
  20,50,"He (Moses) said: our Master is the One who gave everything its creation, then guided (it)"
  20,51,"He said: so, what about the previous generations"
