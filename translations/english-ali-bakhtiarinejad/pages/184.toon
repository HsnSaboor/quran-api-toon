  8,59,"And those who disbelieved should not think that they are ahead, indeed they cannot incapacitate (or escape from God)"
  8,60,And prepare whatever forces and saddled horses (and other equipments and ammunition) you can against them to frighten with it the enemies of God and your enemies and others beside them whom you do not know but God knows them.

  8,61,"And if they incline to peace, then you incline to it too, and trust in God. Indeed He hears all and knows all"
