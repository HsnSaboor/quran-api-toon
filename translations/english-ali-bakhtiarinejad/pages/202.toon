quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  9,94,"They apologize to you when you return to them. Say: do not apologize, we would never believe you, God has informed us about you. And God and His messenger are going to see your actions, then you are returned to knower of the unseen and the visible, then He informs you of what you were doing"
  9,95,"When you return to them, they are going to swear by God for you, so that you stay away from them. So stay away from them, indeed they are filthy, and their housing is hell as payback for what they were doing"
  9,96,"They swear for you so that you are pleased with them, but even if you are pleased with them, God is not pleased with the disobedient people"
  9,97,"The desert Arabs are the worst in disbelief and hypocrisy, and more likely that they do not know the limits which God sent down to His messenger. God is knowledgeable and wise"
  9,98,"Some of the desert Arabs consider what they spend as a fine, and wait for a disaster for you. The bad disaster is for them. And God hears all and knows all"
  9,99,"And some of the desert Arabs believe in God and the last day, and consider what they spend as (a means of) closeness to God and the messenger’s praying (for them). Know that it is (a means of) closeness for them. God is going to admit them into His mercy. God is forgiving and merciful"
