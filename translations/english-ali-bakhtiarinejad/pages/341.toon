  22,74,"They did not value God, His true worth. Indeed God is strong and powerful"
  22,75,God chooses messengers from the angels and from the people. Indeed God hears all and sees all
  22,76,"He knows what is in front of them and what is behind them, and the affairs are returned to God"
  22,77,"You who believe, bow down and be humble (and prostrate) and serve your Master and do good, so that you may succeed"
  22,78,"And try hard in God's way, a trying that He deserves. He chose you, and He did not impose any difficulty on you in the way of life (religion). This is faith of your father Abraham.
