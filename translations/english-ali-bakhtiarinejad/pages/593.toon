  89,1,By the dawn
  89,2,and by the ten nights
  89,3,and by the even and the odd
  89,4,and by the night when it goes away
  89,5,Is there an oath in that for one who has understanding
  89,6,Did you not see what your Master did with Aad
  89,7,(people of) Iram (a city) with the pillars
  89,8,the like of which was not created in the lands
  89,9,and Thamud those who carved out the rocks in the valley
  89,10,and Pharaoh having the stakes (pyramids)
  89,11,Those who rebelled in the lands
  89,12,and increased the corruption in it
  89,13,so your Master unleashed the whip of punishment on them
  89,14,Indeed your Master is on the watch
  89,15,"As for the human being, when his Master tests him and honors him and favors him, then he says: my Master honored me"

  89,20,"and you love the wealth, a great deal of love"
  89,21,"No way, when the earth is pounded, crushed and leveled"

  89,23,"and on that day hell is brought, on that day the human being takes notice, but what (use) does the notice have for him"
