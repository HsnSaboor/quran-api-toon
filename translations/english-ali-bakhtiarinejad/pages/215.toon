quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,54,"And if each person that did wrong, had all that is on the earth, he would have ransomed with it, and he would hide the regret when he sees the punishment. And it will be judged between them with justice and they will not be wronged"
  10,55,"Know that whatever is in the skies and the earth belongs to God. Know that God’s promise is true, but most of them do not know"
  10,56,"He gives life and causes death, and you are returned to Him"
  10,57,"People, an advice has come to you from your Master, and a healing for what is in the chests and a guidance and a mercy for the believers"
  10,58,"Say: they should be happy with God’s grace and His mercy. That is better than what they accumulate"
  10,59,"Say: what do you think that God sent down some provisions to you, then you made some of it unlawful and some lawful. Say: did God permit you or you made up lies (and attributed them) to God"
  10,60,"What do those who make up lies (and attribute them) to God think about the resurrection day? God is indeed gracious to people, but most of them do not thank"
  10,61,"You are not in any situation/affair, and you do not read any part of Quran, and you do not do any action except We are witness over you when you engage in it. Not even a tiny particle in the earth or in the sky, and not smaller or larger than that, escapes your Master, but it is in a clear book"
