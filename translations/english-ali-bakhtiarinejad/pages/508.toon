  47,15,"Example of the garden that is promised to those who control themselves is: there are rivers of unpolluted water in it, and rivers of milk that its taste does not change, and rivers of wine that is delicious (and pleasing) for the drinkers, and rivers of purified honey, and they have all kind of fruits and forgiveness from their Master in it. (Are they like) someone who remains in the fire forever and drinks boiling water that cuts up their intestines"
  47,16,"And some among them (pretend to) listen to you, until they go away from you (and leave you), then they say to those who were given the knowledge: what did he say just now? They are those whom God sealed their hearts and they follow their desires"
