quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"He said: you messengers, so what is your business"
  51,32,"They said: we were sent to a group of guilty ones"
  51,33,so that we send upon them stones of clay
  51,34,marked by your Master for the excessive ones
  51,35,So We brought out anyone who was among the believers in it
  51,36,But We only found a house of the submitted ones in it
  51,37,And We left a sign in it for those who fear the painful punishment
  51,38,And in (the story of) Moses when We sent him to Pharaoh with a clear authorization
  51,39,"Then he turned away with his base (of supporters) and said: a magician or a madman"
  51,40,"So We took him and his troops, then We threw them in the sea, and he was to blame"
  51,41,And in (the story of) Aad when We sent upon them the destructive wind
  51,42,"It did not leave anything that it came upon it, except making it as the decomposed thing"
  51,43,"And (the story of) Thamud when they were told: enjoy yourselves for a while"
  51,44,"Then they rebelled against their Master’s command, so the thunderbolt took them while they were looking"
  51,45,Then they could not stand up and they could not take revenge (or defend)
  51,46,"And people of Noah in the past, indeed they were disobedient people"
  51,47,We built the sky with Our power and We are certainly expanding (it)
  51,48,"And We spread out the earth, and how good We spread out"
  51,49,"And We created pairs of everything, so you may take notice"
  51,50,So run away to God. Indeed I am a clear warner for you from Him
  51,51,And do not set up another god with God. Indeed I am a clear warner for you from Him
