quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,41,"March forward, lightly or heavily (equipped) and try hard with your possessions and your lives in God’s way. This is better for you if you knew"
  9,42,"Had there been an immediate gain and an easy journey they would have certainly followed you, but the far distance was hard for them, and they are going to swear by God: we would certainly come out with you if we could. They destroy themselves, and God knows they are definitely liars"
  9,43,"God excused you (Muhammad), why did you permit them (to stay behind) before it becomes to you those who were truthful and you know the liars"
  9,44,Those who believe in God and the last day do not ask your permission to try hard with their possessions and their lives. God knows those who control themselves
  9,45,Only those who do not believe in God and the last day and their hearts are in doubt ask your permission (to be excused from fighting). So they waver (back and forth) in their doubt
  9,46,"If they wanted to go out (with you), they would have prepared for it, but God disliked sending them, so He held them back, and it was said: sit with the sitting ones"
  9,47,"If they had come out among you, they would have added nothing to you but trouble, and they would have actively participated among you looking for turmoil (and disorder), and some among you would have listened for them (and spied for them). God knows the wrongdoers"
