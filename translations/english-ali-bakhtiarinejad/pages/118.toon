  5,58,"And when you call for the mandatory prayer they take it as a joke and a game, that is because they are a group who do not understand"
  5,59,"Say: people of the book, do you resent us only because we believed in God and what was sent down to us and what was sent down from before, while most of you are disobedient"
  5,60,"Say: shall I inform you of worse than this as a penalty from God? Whoever God cursed and was angry at him and He made some of them into the monkeys and the pigs and servants of the rebellious. They are in a bad position and far lost from the even (right) way"
  5,61,"And when they come to you they say: we believe. But they have entered in disbelief and they have left with it, and God fully knows what they were hiding"

  5,64,"And the Jewish said: God’s hand is tied. Their hands are tied and they are cursed for what they said. But His hands are wide open, He spends as He wants. And what was sent down to you from your Master shall increase rebellion and disbelief of many of them. And We placed the animosity and the hatred between them until the resurrection day. Every time they ignite a fire for the war, God extinguishes it, and they spread corruption on the earth, whereas God does not like the corruptors"
