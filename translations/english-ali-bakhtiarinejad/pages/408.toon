quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  30,33,"And when trouble touches the people, they call on their Master turning to Him (in repentance), then when He makes them taste from His mercy, then all of a sudden some of them associate (partners) with their Master"
  30,34,"in order to be unthankful for what We gave them. So enjoy (for a while), then you will know"
  30,35,Or did We send down any reason to them and it speaks of what they were associating with Him
  30,36,"And when We make the people taste a mercy, then they are happy with it, and if something bad happens to them because of what their hands sent ahead (and what they did) then they lose hope"
  30,37,Or did they not see that God increases and decreases the provision for anyone He wants. Indeed there are signs in that for people who believe
  30,38,"So give the relatives (and close ones) and the needy and the traveler (in need) their due. That is better for those who want God’s attention (and His pleasure), and they are the successful ones"
  30,39,"And whatever usury (excessive interest) you give to increase wealth of the people, it does not increase with God, while whatever you give in mandatory charity, wanting God's attention (and His pleasure), then those are the multiplied ones"
  30,40,"God is the One who created you, then provided for you, then makes you die, then makes you live. Is there any of your partners (of God) who can do any of those things? God is flawless and is above what they associate (with Him)"
  30,41,"The corruption (and famine and drought) appeared in the land and the sea because of what the people’s hand did, so that He makes them taste some of that which they did, so they may return"
