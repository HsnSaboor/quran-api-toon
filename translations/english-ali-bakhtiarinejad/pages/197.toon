  9,64,"The hypocrites are afraid that a chapter is sent down about them informing them of what is in their hearts. Say: make fun, indeed God brings out what you are wary of"
  9,65,"And if you ask them, they shall say: we were only kidding and playing. Say: were you making fun of God and His signs and His messenger"
  9,66,"Do not apologize, indeed you disbelieved after your belief. If We excuse a group of you, We will punish a group, because they were guilty"
  9,67,"The hypocrite men and the hypocrite women are like each other, they instruct what is wrong (unacceptable) and prohibit from what is right (acceptable), and they withhold their hands. They forgot God, so He forgets them. The hypocrites are indeed the disobedient ones"
  9,68,"God promised fire of hell to the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women and the disbelievers, remaining in there forever. It is enough for them. And God cursed them and an everlasting punishment is for them"
