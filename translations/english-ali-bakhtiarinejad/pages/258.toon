They say: if God had guided us, we would have certainly guided you, it is the same for us whether we are anxious or we are patient, for there is no way of escape for us"
  14,22,"And when the matter was decided, Satan said: indeed God promised you a true promise, and I promised you and I failed to keep my promise, I had no authority over you except that I invited you and you accepted my invitation, so do not blame me but blame yourselves, I am not your rescuer and you are not my rescuer, I disbelieve in you associating me (as partner) with God in the past. The wrongdoers have a painful punishment"
