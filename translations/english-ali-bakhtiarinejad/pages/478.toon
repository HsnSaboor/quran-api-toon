  41,15,"And as for Aad, they were unjustifiably arrogant on the earth, and they said: who is more powerful than us? Did they not see that God, the One who created them, is more powerful than them? And they used to reject Our signs"
  41,16,"So We sent a brutal cold wind upon them for several miserable days in order that We make them taste the humiliating punishment in this world’s life while the punishment of the hereafter is certainly more humiliating, and they will not be helped"
