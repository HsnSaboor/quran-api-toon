quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,"No way, but you like the transient (this world’s life)"
  75,21,and you leave the hereafter
  75,22,On that day some faces glow (from happiness)
  75,23,looking at their Master
  75,24,And on that day some faces are gloomy (from sadness)
  75,25,thinking that a back breaking punishment will be done to them
  75,26,"No way, when it (life) reaches to the collarbones (and the throat)"
  75,27,"and it is said: who is a healer"
  75,28,And he thinks that it is the (time of) separation
  75,29,and the leg is twisted around the leg
  75,30,on that day the course is to you Master
  75,31,He did not accept the truth and he did not pray
  75,32,but he denied and he turned away
  75,33,then he went to his family walking proudly
  75,34,Woe to you and woe
  75,35,Then woe to you and woe
  75,36,Does the human being think that he is left aimlessly
  75,37,Was he not a fertilized egg from ejaculated semen
  75,38,"then it became a (dangling, clinging, and leach like) blood clot, then He created and shaped (it)"
  75,39,"then He made two kinds of it, the male and the female"
  75,40,Is not such (a creator) able to give life to the dead
  76,1,Did not a period of time come upon the human being that he was nothing to be mentioned
  76,2,"Indeed We created the human being from a mixture of fertilized egg (Zygote) to test him, and We made hearing and sight for him"
  76,3,"Indeed We guided him to the way, whether he is grateful or whether he is ungrateful"
  76,4,We prepared chains and shackles and burning fire for the disbelievers
  76,5,Indeed the good ones drink from a cup that its mixture is camphor
