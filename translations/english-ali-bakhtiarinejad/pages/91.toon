quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,80,"Whoever obeys the messenger then he has indeed obeyed God, and whoever turns back, We did not send you as their guardian"
  4,81,"And they say: obedience. But when they leave you, a group of them contemplate by night in other than what you say, but God writes what they contemplate by night, so stay away from them and put your trust in God. God is enough as an advocate"
  4,82,"Do they not think about the Quran? And if it was from other than God, they would find a lot of contradictions in it"
  4,83,"And when any news of safety or fear comes to them, they publicize it, while if they had referred it to the messenger and those among them who are in charge, then those among them who can find it out (the truth) would certainly know it. And if it was not for God’s grace and mercy on you, you would have certainly followed Satan, except a few (of you)"
  4,84,"So (Muhammad) fight in God's way, you are only responsible for yourself, and persuade the believers (to fight). Perhaps God holds back the harm of those who disbelieved. God is most strong and most punishing"
  4,85,"Anyone mediates a good mediation (in a good cause) has a share of it, and anyone who mediates a bad mediation (in a bad cause) has a portion of it. God has control over everything"
  4,86,"And when you are greeted with a greeting, then greet with better than that or return it. God takes everything into account"
