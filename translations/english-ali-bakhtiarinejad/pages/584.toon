quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,When his Master called him in the holy valley of Tuwa
  79,17,go to Pharaoh for indeed he rebelled
  79,18,"Then say: do you like to purify (and absolve) yourself"
  79,19,and I guide you to your Master so you would fear (Him)
  79,20,Then he showed him the great miracle
  79,21,But he denied and disobeyed
  79,22,then he turned his back trying (against God)
  79,23,Then he gathered (his people) and called out
  79,24,"and said: I am your master, the highest"
  79,25,So God took him with exemplary punishment of the hereafter and this life
  79,26,Indeed there is a lesson in that for anyone who fears (God)
  79,27,Are you harder to create or the sky that He built it
  79,28,He raised its roof and arranged it
  79,29,And He darkened its nights and brought out its daylight
  79,30,And after that He expanded the earth
  79,31,He brought out its water and its pasture from it
  79,32,and He set the mountains firm
  79,33,An enjoyment for you and your livestock
  79,34,So when the great disaster comes
  79,35,a day when the human being remembers what he tried
  79,36,and the hellfire is exposed for anyone who sees
  79,37,So anyone who rebelled
  79,38,and preferred this world's life
  79,39,then indeed the hellfire is the housing (for him)
  79,40,And as for someone who is afraid of his Master's position and prevents himself from the desires
  79,41,then indeed the garden is the housing (for him)
  79,42,They ask you about the hour that when does it come in
  79,43,In what (basis) would you mention it (when you have no knowledge of it)
  79,44,Its ending is up to your Master
  79,45,You are only a warner for anyone who fears it
  79,46,"A day that they see it, it is as if they stayed an evening or its morning"
