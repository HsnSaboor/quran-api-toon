quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  14,11,"Their messengers told them: we are only human beings like you, but God favors upon any one of His servants that He wants, and it is not for us to bring you a reason except with God’s permission, and believers should put their trust in God"
  14,12,"And why should we not put our trust in God, while He has guided us in our ways? And we shall persevere over what you harass us. And those who trust should put their trust in God"
  14,13,"And those who disbelieved said to their messengers: we shall drive you out of our land or you shall return to our faith. Then their Master revealed to them: We shall destroy the wrongdoers"
  14,14,And We shall make you inhabit the land after them. That is for those who fear My position and fear My threat (of punishment)
  14,15,"And they asked for victory, and every stubborn tyrant was disappointed"
  14,16,"Hell is ahead of him, and he is made to drink from rotten water"
  14,17,"He sips it and does not swallow it easily, and death comes to him from everywhere but he does not die, and beyond it is a severe punishment"
  14,18,The works of those who disbelieved in their Master is like ashes that a strong wind blows on it on a stormy day. They are not able to gain anything from what they did. That is being lost far away (from the right path)
