quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,184,And be cautious of the One who created you and the earlier generations
  26,185,"They said: indeed you are of the bewitched ones"
  26,186,"you are only a human being like us, and we think you are among the liars"
  26,187,"So, make pieces of the sky fall on us, if you are of the truthful ones"
  26,188,"He said: my Master knows best what you do"
  26,189,"So they denied him, then the punishment of day of the covering clouds (of fire) took them. Indeed it was the punishment of a great day"
  26,190,"Indeed there is a sign in that, and most of them are not believers"
  26,191,And indeed your Master is the powerful and the merciful
  26,192,And it (Quran) is certainly a sending down by the Master of Human kind
  26,193,The honest spirit (Gabriel) came down with it
  26,194,to your heart so that you be of the warners
  26,195,in clear Arabic language
  26,196,And indeed it is in the scriptures of the earlier ones
  26,197,Is it not a sign for them that the knowledgeable children of Israel know it
  26,198,And if We had sent it down to someone of the non-Arabs
  26,199,"and he had read it to them, they would not have been believers in it"
  26,200,That is how We insert/pass it through the hearts of guilty ones
  26,201,they would not believe in it until they see the painful punishment
  26,202,And it comes to them suddenly while they do not realize
  26,203,"Then they say: may we be given a delay"
  26,204,Do they still want to rush Our punishment
  26,205,So did you think that if We make them enjoy for some years
  26,206,then what they were promised (the punishment) comes to them
