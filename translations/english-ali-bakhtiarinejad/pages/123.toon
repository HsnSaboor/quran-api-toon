quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,90,"You who believe, the wine (and alcoholic beverages) and the gambling and the statues (of idols) and the fortune-telling arrows are only filthy work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful"
  5,91,"Satan only wants to create animosity and hatred among you with the wine (and alcoholic beverages) and the gambling, and to keep you away from God's remembrance and the mandatory prayer, so will you stop it"
  5,92,And obey God and obey the messenger and be careful. And if you turn away then know that Our messenger's responsibility is only the clear preaching (and delivering the message)
  5,93,"There is no blame on those who believed and did good works for what they ate, when they were cautious and believed and did good works, then they were cautious and believed, then they were cautious and did good. And God loves the good doers"
  5,94,"You who believe, God shall test you with something of the hunt that is within the reach of your hands and your spears, so that God knows who fears Him secretly. So whoever exceeds the limits after that then there is a painful punishment for him"
  5,95,"You who believe, do not kill the game (in hunting) while you are forbidden (during the Hajj). Anyone of you who kills it intentionally, then his punishment is the livestock like what he killed, as judged by two just persons among you, as an offering to reach the Ka'aba, or penalty of feeding some needy or the equivalent of that in fasting, so he may taste the consequence of his action. God excuses what is passed, and anyone who returns (to such actions) then God revenges from him, and God is powerful and revengeful"
