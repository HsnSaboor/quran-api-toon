quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,So there is no close friend for him here today
  69,36,and no food except pus
  69,37,that no one eats it except the sinners
  69,38,So I swear by what you see
  69,39,and what you do not see
  69,40,that it (Quran) is certainly a noble messenger’s word
  69,41,and it is not word of a poet. A few of you believe (or you believe a little)
  69,42,And it is not word of a fortune-teller (or a priest). You take a little notice
  69,43,A sending down from the Master of Human kind
  69,44,And if he had made up some saying (and attributed them) to Us
  69,45,We would have certainly taken him by the right hand
  69,46,then We would have cut off his main artery
  69,47,and none of you could have kept it away from him
  69,48,And certainly it (Quran) is certainly a reminder for those who control themselves
  69,49,And We certainly know that some of you are deniers
  69,50,And it is certainly (cause of) a regret for the disbelievers
  69,51,And it is certainly the sure truth
  69,52,So glorify the name of your great Master
  70,1,A questioner asked about a punishment bound to happen
  70,2,None can prevent it for the disbelievers
  70,3,"(It is) from God, the owner of the places of ascent"
  70,4,The angels and the spirit ascend to Him in a day that its measure is fifty thousand years
  70,5,"So be patient, a nice patience"
  70,6,Indeed they see it far
  70,7,while We see it near
  70,8,A day that the sky is like the melted copper
  70,9,and the mountains are like the colored wool
  70,10,and a friend does not ask about a friend
