  3,84,"Say: we believed in God, and what was sent down to us, and what was sent down to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Tribes (of Israel), and what was given to Moses and Jesus and the prophets from their Master, we do not differentiate between any of them, and we are submitted to Him"
  3,85,"Whoever looks for a way of life other than submission (to God), it will never be accepted from him, and in the hereafter he will be of the losers"
  3,86,"How does God guide a group who disbelieved after their belief, and testified that the messenger is true and clear proofs came to them? God does not guide the wrongdoing people"

  3,88,"remaining in it forever, their punishment will not be reduced, and they are not given any delay"
  3,89,"except those who repented and straightened out after that, then God is forgiving and merciful"
  3,90,"Indeed those who disbelieved after their belief, and then increased their disbelief, their repentance will never be accepted, and they are the misguided"
  3,91,"Indeed if those who disbelieved and died while disbelievers fill the earth with gold and offer it as ransom, it will never be accepted from any of them. They have a painful punishment, and they have no helpers"
