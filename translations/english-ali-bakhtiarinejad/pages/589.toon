quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,they are on sofas looking
  83,36,Were the disbelievers rewarded for (anything other than) what they used to do
  84,1,When the sky splits
  84,2,and it listens to its Master and it is required (to listen)
  84,3,and when the earth is stretched
  84,4,and throws out what is inside of it and becomes empty
  84,5,and it listens to its Master and it is required (to listen)
  84,6,"Human being, indeed you are a hard worker toward your Master, working hard, and you meet Him"
  84,7,As for anyone who is given his book to his right hand
  84,8,"then he is called to account, an easy account"
  84,9,and he returns happily to his family
  84,10,But anyone who is given his book from behind his back
  84,11,Then he will call for destruction (and his death)
  84,12,while he enters (and burns in) the burning fire
  84,13,Indeed he was happy among his family
  84,14,Indeed he thought that he would never return
  84,15,"Yes, his Master was indeed watching him"
  84,16,So I swear by the sunset glow
  84,17,and the night and what it collects
  84,18,and the moon when it is full
  84,19,that you shall move on from state after state
  84,20,So what is with them that they do not believe
  84,21,"and when the Quran is read to them, they do not show humbleness"
  84,22,"No, but those who disbelieved deny"
  84,23,and God knows better what they hold (inside them)
  84,24,So give them the news of a painful punishment
  84,25,"except those who believed and did good works, as they have an unending reward"
