  56,51,"Then indeed you, the misguided deniers"
  56,52,are certainly eaters of Zaqqum tree
  56,53,and filling the stomachs from it
  56,54,then drinking boiling water over it
  56,55,and drinking as thirsty camels drink
  56,56,This is their entertainment on the judgment day

  56,58,What do you think of what you ejaculate
  56,59,Do you create it or are We the creators
  56,60,"We mandated the death among you, and We will not be surpassed"
  56,61,in replacing (you with) the likes of you and producing you in (a form) that you do not know

  56,63,What do you think of what you plant
  56,64,"Do you grow it, or are We the growers"

  56,71,What do you think of the fire that you light
  56,72,"Did you make its tree, or are We the makers"
  56,73,We made it a reminder and a provision for those living/traveling in the desert
  56,74,So glorify the name of your great Master
