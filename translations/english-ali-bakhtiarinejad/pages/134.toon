  6,53,"And that is how We tested some of them by the others, so that they say: are these the ones whom God favored upon them among us? Does not God know the thankful ones better"
  6,54,"And when those who believe in Our signs come to you, say: peace (and well-being) upon you. Your Master prescribed the mercy for Himself, that anyone of you who did something bad out of ignorance then he repented afterward and straightened out, He is indeed forgiving and merciful"
  6,55,"And that is how We explain the signs, in order to expose way of the guilty ones"
  6,56,"Say: I am forbidden to serve those you call on other than God. Say: I do not follow your desires, then I have lost (the right path) and will not be of the guided"
  6,57,"Say: I am on a clear proof from my Master while you deny that, what you want to rush it is not with me (in my power), the decision (and making rule) only belongs to Go, He tells the truth and He is best of the deciders"
  6,58,"Say: if what you want to hurry about it was with me then the matter was decided between me and you, and God best knows the wrongdoers"
  6,59,"And keys of the unseen are with Him and no one knows it except Him, and He knows what is in the land and in the sea and no leaf falls unless He knows about it, and there is no seed in darkness of the earth, and nothing wet and nothing dry unless it is in a clear book"
