quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,38,"Say: enter the fire among the communities of Jinn and humans who have passed away before you. Every time a group enters, its sister (that went in before it) curses it until they all get in there. The later ones say about the earlier ones: our Master, these misguided us, so give them double punishment of the fire. He (God) says: double for all, but you do not know"
  7,39,"And the earlier ones say to the later ones: there is no advantage for you over us, so taste the punishment for what you used to do"
  7,40,"Indeed gates of the heaven do not open for those who denied Our signs and were arrogant about them, and they do not enter the garden until a camel passes through the eye of the needle, and that is how We punish the guilty ones"
  7,41,"Their resting place is hell and above them is a covering, and that is how We punish the wrongdoers"
  7,42,"And those who believed and did good works are inhabitants of the garden remaining in there forever, We do not task any person beyond its capability"
  7,43,"And We remove whatever resentment that is in their chests, and beneath them rivers flow, and they say: all praise belongs to God, the One who guided us to this, and we were not guided if God did not guide us, certainly our Master's messengers have brought the truth. And they are called out that this is the garden that you inherited it for what you were doing"
