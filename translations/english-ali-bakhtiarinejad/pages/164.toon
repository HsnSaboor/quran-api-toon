quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  7,105,"It is my duty that I only say the truth about God, I have brought you clear proof from your Master, so send the children of Israel with me"
  7,106,"He (Pharaoh) said: if you brought a miracle, then bring it if you are truthful"
  7,107,So he threw down his cane and it turned into a visible serpent
  7,108,And he took out his hand (from his vest) and it was white to the viewers
  7,109,"The assembly of Pharaoh’s people said: he is a knowledgeable magician"
  7,110,"He wants to drive you out of your land, so what do you instruct"
  7,111,"They said: put him and his brother off (for a while) and send gatherers to the cities"
  7,112,to bring you every knowledgeable magician
  7,113,"The magicians came to Pharaoh and said: is there any reward for us if we are the winners"
  7,114,"He said: yes, and you shall be of the close ones (to me)"
  7,115,"They said: Moses, do you throw or are we the throwers"
  7,116,"He said: you throw. So when they threw, they bewitched people’s eyes and frightened them and they brought a great magic"
  7,117,"And We revealed to Moses: throw your cane, and it suddenly swallows whatever they fake"
  7,118,So the truth was proved and whatever they were doing was invalidated
  7,119,"So they were defeated there, and they turned belittled"
  7,120,"And the magicians fell, showing humbleness"
