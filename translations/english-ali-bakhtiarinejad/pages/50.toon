quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,1,L.M. (Alif. Lam. Mim)
  3,2,"God, there is no god except Him, the living and the eternal"
  3,3,He sent down the book to you with the truth confirming what was before it and He sent down the Torah and the Gospel
  3,4,"in the past as a guide for the people, and He sent down the criterion. Indeed those who disbelieved in God’s signs, a severe punishment is for them. God is powerful and revengeful"
  3,5,Nothing is hidden from God on the earth and in the skies
  3,6,"He is the One who shapes you in the wombs as He wants. There is no god except Him, The powerful and the wise"
  3,7,"He is the One who sent down the book to you, of which some verses are firm and they are the basis of the book, and others are metaphorical. As for those who have perversion in their hearts, they follow the metaphorical ones of it, wishing for disorder and looking for its interpretation, while no one except God knows their interpretation. And the scholars of knowledge say: we believe in it, all of it is from our Master. But only the people of understanding (reasonable people) take notice"
  3,8,"Our Master, do not let our hearts deviate after You guided us, and give us mercy from Your presence. You are the giver"
  3,9,"Our Master, You are gatherer of the people on the day that there is no doubt about it. God does not break the promise"
