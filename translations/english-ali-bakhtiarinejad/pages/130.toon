quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Say: what thing is greatest testimony? Say: God, a witness between me and you, and this Quran was revealed to me in order that I warn you and whoever it reaches with it. Do you testify that there are other gods with God? Say: I do not testify. Say: He is the only one god, and I am free of what you associate (with Him)"
  6,20,"Those whom We gave them the book, know him (Muhammad) as they know their children. Those who lost their souls do not believe"
  6,21,And who is more wrong than someone who makes up a lie (and attributes it) to God or denies His signs. Indeed the wrongdoers do not succeed
  6,22,"On a day that We gather them all together, then We say to those who associated (partners with Us): where are your partners, those you used to claim"
  6,23,"Then there would be no excuse for them except saying: by God our Master, we were not polytheist"
  6,24,"See how they lied to themselves, and what they used to make up abandoned them"
  6,25,"And some of them (pretend to) listen to you, but We placed a cover on their hearts so they do not understand it and made their ears hard of hearing, and if they see every sign they do not believe in it, until when they come to you and they argue with you. Those who disbelieved say: This (Quran) is nothing but stories of the earlier ones"
  6,26,"And they prohibit (others) from it and they keep away from it, and they only destroy themselves and they do not realize"
  6,27,"And if you see when they are made to stop by the fire, then they said: we wish we are sent back and we would not deny our Master's signs and we would become of the believers"
