quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the sky and the night-comer (the evening star)
  86,2,And do you know what the evening star is
  86,3,It is the sharp bright star
  86,4,Indeed every person has a guardian (watching) over him
  86,5,So the human being should look at what he is created from
  86,6,He is created from an ejected fluid
  86,7,coming out from between the backbone and the ribs
  86,8,Indeed He is capable of his return
  86,9,a day that the secrets are disclosed
  86,10,then he has no power and no helper
  86,11,And by the sky that has the returning (rain clouds)
  86,12,and by the earth having the crack (for sprouting)
  86,13,indeed it (Quran) is a decisive word
  86,14,and it is not a joke
  86,15,Indeed they plot a plot
  86,16,and I plan a plan
  86,17,"So give the disbelievers time, give them time without rushing"
  87,1,"Glorify the name of your Master, the highest"
  87,2,"The One who created, then shaped"
  87,3,and the One who decreed and guided
  87,4,and the One who brought out the pastures
  87,5,then He made it dried up and black
  87,6,"We are going to read (Quran) to you, and you will not forget"
  87,7,except what God wants. Indeed He knows the evident and what is hidden
  87,8,And We make you ready for the easier way
  87,9,So remind if the reminder benefits
  87,10,"Then anyone who fears, is going to take notice"
  87,11,while the most miserable ones avoid it
  87,12,the one who enters (and burns in) the great fire
  87,13,he does not die and he does not live in there
  87,14,Everyone has succeeded who purified (himself)
  87,15,"and remembered the name of his Master, and prayed"
