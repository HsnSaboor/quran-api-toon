quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,"No, but you prefer this world's life"
  87,17,while the hereafter is better and more lasting
  87,18,Indeed this is in the earlier scriptures
  87,19,scriptures of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,Did the story of the overwhelming come to you
  88,2,On that day (some) faces are humble
  88,3,"working hard, exhausted"
  88,4,entering (and burning in) a scorching fire
  88,5,they are made to drink from a boiling spring
  88,6,There is no food for them except from a thorny plant
  88,7,that does not nourish and it does not satisfy hunger
  88,8,On that day (other) faces are delightful
  88,9,pleased with their effort
  88,10,in an excellent garden
  88,11,they do not hear any useless talk in it
  88,12,a running spring in it
  88,13,raised sofas in it
  88,14,and drinking glasses set in place
  88,15,and pillows arranged in rows
  88,16,and spread out rugs
  88,17,"Do they not look at the camel, how it is created"
  88,18,"And at the sky, how it is raised"
  88,19,"And at the mountain, how it is set up"
  88,20,"And at the earth, how it is spread out"
  88,21,"So remind (them), for you are only to remind"
  88,22,You are not an overseer for them
  88,23,But anyone who turns away and disbelieves
  88,24,then God punishes him with the great punishment
  88,25,Indeed their return is to Us
  88,26,then indeed their accounting is on Us
