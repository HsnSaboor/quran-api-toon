  21,38,"And they say: when is this promise, if you are truthful"
  21,39,If those who disbelieved knew of the time that they will not be able to keep the fire away from their faces and from their backs and they will not be helped (then they would not say such things)
  21,40,"No, but it (punishment) comes to them suddenly and stuns them and they cannot repel it and they are not given any delay"
  21,41,"And messengers before you were certainly ridiculed, then those who laughed at them were surrounded by what they were ridiculing it (the punishment)"
  21,42,"Say: who protects you in the night and the day from the beneficent? Yet they turn away from remembering their Master"
