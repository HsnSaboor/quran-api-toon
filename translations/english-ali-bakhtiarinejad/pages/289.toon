quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  17,67,"When the harm happens to you in the sea, whomever you call on abandons except Him. But when He saves you (and bring you back) to the land, you stay away (from Him). The human being is very ungrateful"
  17,68,Do you feel safe that He does not makes you sink in a part of the land or He does not send you a sandstorm then you will not find any advocate for yourselves
  17,69,Or do you feel safe that He does not bring you back into it (the sea) another time and He sends you a hurricane of wind and drowns you because you disbelieved then you will not find a prosecutor (or anyone to sue) against Us for it
  17,70,"And We have certainly honored the children of Adam and We carried them in the land and the sea, and We provided them with good things and We preferred them over most of what We created"
  17,71,"On a day that We call all people with their book of records (or their scripture or their leader), then whoever is given his book in his right hand are those who read their book (with pleasure) and they will not be wronged a bit"
  17,72,"And anyone who is blind in this (world), then he is blind in the hereafter, and far lost from a (right) way"
  17,73,"And they were about to tempt you away from what We revealed to you, so that you make up something different than that about Us (and attribute it to Us), and then they would have taken you as a friend"
  17,74,"And if We had not strengthened you, you would have almost leaned toward them a little bit"
  17,75,"Then We would certainly make you taste double/multiple (punishment) in the life and double/multiple in the death, and you would not have found any helper against Us"
