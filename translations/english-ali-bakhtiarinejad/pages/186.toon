quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  8,70,"Prophet, tell the captives who are in your hands: if God knows any good in your hearts, He gives you better than what was taken from you, and He forgives you. God is forgiving and merciful"
  8,71,"And if they want to betray you, they have certainly betrayed God in the past, so He gave you power over them. God is knowledgeable and wise"
  8,72,"Indeed those who believed and migrated and tried hard with their possessions and their lives in God's way, and those who placed and helped (them), some of them are supporters (and friends) of the others. And those who believed and did not migrate, there is nothing upon you for their protection until they migrate. But if they ask for your help in the religion, then the help is your responsibility, except against a group that there is an agreement between you and them. God sees what you do"
  8,73,"Some of those who disbelieved are supporters (and friends) of the others. If you do not do that, there will be turmoil (and persecution) and great corruption on the earth"
  8,74,"Those who believed and migrated and tried hard in God's way, and those who placed and helped (them), they are the true believers, for them there is forgiveness and noble provisions"
  8,75,"And those who believed afterward and migrated and tried hard with you, then they are of you. And in the book of God, some blood relatives (and close relatives) have preference over others. God knows everything"
