quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,"No way, definitely the record of the immoral ones is in Sijjin"
  83,8,And do you know what Sijjin is
  83,9,It is a written book
  83,10,Woe to the deniers on that day
  83,11,those who deny the judgment day
  83,12,And no one denies it except every sinner exceeding the limits
  83,13,"When Our verses are read to him, he says: stories of the earlier ones"
  83,14,"No way, but what they used to do covered their hearts with rust"
  83,15,"No way, indeed on that day they are excluded from their Master"
  83,16,Then indeed they shall enter (and burn in) the hellfire
  83,17,"Then it is said: this is what you used to deny it"
  83,18,"No way, indeed the record of the good ones is certainly in Illiyin"
  83,19,And do you know what Illiyin is
  83,20,A written book
  83,21,the close ones (to God) testify to it
  83,22,Indeed the good ones shall be in delight
  83,23,They are on the sofas looking
  83,24,You recognize glow of the delight in their faces
  83,25,They are given sealed nectar to drink
  83,26,Its seal is musk. And the contenders should compete for that
  83,27,And its mixture is from Tasneem
  83,28,a spring that the close ones (to God) drink from it
  83,29,Indeed those who were guilty used to laugh at those who believed
  83,30,"and when they passed by them, they would wink at each other (ridiculing them)"
  83,31,and when they returned to their people they would return joyfully
  83,32,"and when they saw them, they would say: these are certainly lost ones"
  83,33,Although they were not sent as guardians over them
  83,34,So today those who believed laugh at the disbelievers
