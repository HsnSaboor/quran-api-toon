quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  76,6,"A spring that God's servants drink from it, they make it flow out, flowing out (as they please)"
  76,7,They fulfill the pledge and they are afraid of a day that its badness is wide spread
  76,8,and they feed the food to poor and orphans and captives for His love
  76,9,"(saying:) we feed you only for God's sake, we don't want any reward or thanks from you"
  76,10,we are afraid of our Master in a harsh and distressful day
  76,11,So God protected them from badness of that day and gave them vitality and happiness
  76,12,And their reward for what they endured is garden and silk
  76,13,"Leaning on sofas in it, they do not see (burning) sun and bitter (freezing) cold in it"
  76,14,"And its shades are close over them and its fruits are lowered, hanging low"
  76,15,And silver bowls and drinking glasses made of crystals are circulated among them
  76,16,"crystals like silver, they determine their measure (and size)"
  76,17,"And in there, they are given drink from a cup that its mixture is ginger"
  76,18,from a spring in there called Salsabil
  76,19,"And immortal youth circulate among them, that when you see them you think they are scattered pearls"
  76,20,"And when you see it, then you see delight and a great kingdom"
  76,21,"There are clothes of fine green silk and brocade on them, and they are decorated with silver bracelets, and their Master gives them a pure drink to drink"
  76,22,"Indeed this is a reward for you, and your effort is appreciated"
  76,23,Indeed We sent this Quran down to you gradually
  76,24,"So persevere (and be patient) for your Master's command, and do not obey any sinful or ungrateful (disbeliever) among them"
  76,25,And remember your Master’s name morning and afternoon
