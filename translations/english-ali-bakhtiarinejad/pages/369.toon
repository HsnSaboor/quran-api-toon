quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,40,We may follow the magicians if they are the winners
  26,41,"So when the magicians came, they said to Pharaoh: is there a reward for us if we are the winners"
  26,42,"He said: yes, and then you will certainly be among the close ones"
  26,43,"Moses said to them: throw what you are throwing"
  26,44,"So they threw their ropes and their canes and they said: by Pharaoh’s power, we shall be the winners"
  26,45,"Then Moses threw his cane, and it immediately swallowed whatever they faked"
  26,46,"So the magicians fell, prostrating (and showing humbleness)"
  26,47,"They said: we believed in the Master of Human kind"
  26,48,Master of Moses and Aaron
  26,49,"He (Pharaoh) said: did you believe in him before I give you permission? He is certainly your superior, the one who taught you the magic, and you will certainly know that I shall cut off your hands and feet on opposite side, and I shall crucify you all"
  26,50,"They said: no problem, indeed we are returners to our Master"
  26,51,Indeed we hope that our Master forgives us our faults because we are the first of the believers
  26,52,"And We revealed to Moses: travel with My servants by night, indeed you will be followed"
  26,53,So Pharaoh sent gatherers to the cities
  26,54,(saying) indeed these are a small group
  26,55,and they certainly angered us
  26,56,and we are all certainly alert (and ready)
  26,57,So We drove them out of gardens and springs
  26,58,and treasures and honorable position
  26,59,"That is how it was, and We left them as inheritance for children of Israel"
  26,60,So they (Pharaoh’s army) followed them at sunrise
