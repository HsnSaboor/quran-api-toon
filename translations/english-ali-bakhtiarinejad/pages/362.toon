quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,21,"And those who do not expect to meet Us said: why was not the angels sent down to us, or why do we not see our Master? They have certainly been arrogant about themselves, and they rebelled, a great rebellion"
  25,22,"A day that they see the angels, there is no good news for the guilty ones on that day, and they (the angles) say: a forbidden ban (that you receive God's mercy)"
  25,23,And We turn to the work they did and We make it scattered dust
  25,24,"On that day, inhabitants of the garden have a good living place and better relaxing place"
  25,25,A day that the sky with the clouds splits apart and the angels are sent down in a great descent
  25,26,"on that day the true rule belongs to the beneficent, and it is a difficult day for the disbelievers"
  25,27,"And a day that the wrongdoer bites his hands, saying: I wish I had taken the way along with the messenger"
  25,28,"Woe to me, I wish I had not taken so and so as a friend"
  25,29,"He has certainly led me away from the reminder after it came to me, and Satan is a deserter of the human being (as he declares himself clear of the human being)"
  25,30,"And the messenger says: my Master, indeed my people made this Quran abandoned"
  25,31,And that is how We made an enemy from the guilty ones for every messenger . And your Master is enough as a guide and a helper
  25,32,"And those who disbelieved said: why was not the Quran sent down to him all at once? It is like that, so that We strengthen your heart with it, and We recited it to you distinctly (and slowly)"
