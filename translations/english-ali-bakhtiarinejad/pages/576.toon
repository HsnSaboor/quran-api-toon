quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,Indeed he thought and calculated
  74,19,"So death to him, how did he calculate"
  74,20,"Then (again), death to him, how did he calculate"
  74,21,Then he looked
  74,22,then he frowned and looked angry
  74,23,then he turned back and showed arrogance
  74,24,"Then he said: this is only a passed along magic"
  74,25,this is nothing but word of a human being
  74,26,I am going to enter (and burn) him in hell
  74,27,And do you know what hell is
  74,28,It does not spare and it does not leave
  74,29,burning the human being (skin and flesh)
  74,30,(Guarding) over it are nineteen (angels)
  74,31,"and We only made the angels as guardians of the fire and We made their numbers (nineteen) only as a test for those who disbelieved, so that those who were given the book would be certain and to increase the belief of those who believed, and those who were given the book and the believers would not doubt, and so that those who have a disease in their hearts and the disbelievers say: what did God intend with this example. That is how God misguides anyone He wants and guides anyone He wants. And none knows God's soldiers except Him. And this is only a reminder for the human being"
  74,32,"No way, by the moon"
  74,33,and the night when it retreats
  74,34,and the morning when it lightens
  74,35,indeed it (hell) is one of the greatest (signs)
  74,36,a warning for the human being
  74,37,for anyone of you who wants to be ahead or to be behind
  74,38,Every person is bonded by what he did
  74,39,except associates of the right (the fortunate)
  74,40,"in gardens, asking"
  74,41,from the guilty ones
  74,42,what did enter you in hell
  74,43,"They say: we were not the performers of mandatory prayers"
  74,44,and we were not feeding the poor
  74,45,and we used to enter into useless conversation with those conversing uselessly
  74,46,and we used to deny the judgment day
  74,47,until the certainty (of death) came to us
