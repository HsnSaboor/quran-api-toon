quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,62,Know that God's friends have no fear and no sadness
  10,63,those who believed and were controlling themselves
  10,64,they have the good news in this world’s life and in the hereafter. There is no change in God's words. That is the great victory
  10,65,And their talk should not make you sad. Indeed all the honor (and power) belongs to God. He hears all and knows all
  10,66,"Know that indeed everyone in the skies and on the earth, and whatever partners they follow besides God, belongs to God. They only follow the speculation, and they only guess"
  10,67,He is the One who made the night for you to rest in it and the day to see. There are signs in that for people who listen
  10,68,"They said: God took a child. He is flawless, He has no need, everything in the skies and on the earth belongs to Him. You have no reason for this. Do you say about God what you do not know"
  10,69,"Say: those who make up lies (and attribute them) to God do not succeed"
  10,70,"A little enjoyment in this world, then their return is to Us, then We make them taste the severe punishment for what they used to disbelieve"
