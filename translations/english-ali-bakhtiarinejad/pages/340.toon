quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,65,"Did you not see that God brought what is on the earth under your control (and at your service), and the ships sail through the sea by His command? And He keeps the sky from falling on the earth except by His permission. God is certainly gentle and merciful to the people"
  22,66,And He is the One who makes you live then makes you die then brings you (back) to life. Indeed the human being is ungrateful
  22,67,"For every community (of faith) We made ritual to perform it, so they should not dispute with you about the matter (of rituals). And invite (people) to your Master, indeed you are on a right guidance"
  22,68,"And if they argue with you, then say: God knows best what you do"
  22,69,On the resurrection day God judges between you in what you used to disagree about it
  22,70,"Did you not know that God knows whatever is in the skies and the earth? Indeed that is (recorded) in a book, indeed that is easy for God"
  22,71,And they serve other than God that which He did not send down a reason for it and they do not have any knowledge of it. There is no helper for the wrongdoers
  22,72,"And when Our clear signs are read to them, you notice the denial on the faces of those who disbelieved, they are about to assault those who read them Our signs. Say: should I tell you about worse than this? The fire that God promised it to those who disbelieved, and it is a bad destination"
