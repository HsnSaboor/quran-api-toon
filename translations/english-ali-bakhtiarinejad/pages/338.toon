quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  22,47,"They ask you to hurry up with the punishment, while God never breaks His promise. And indeed a day with your Master is like a thousand years of what you count"
  22,48,"And how many a town did I give break to it while it was (filled with) wrongdoer? Then I took it (into punishment), and the final return is to Me"
  22,49,"Say: people, I am only a clear warner for you"
  22,50,"So those who believed and did good works, they have forgiveness and an honorable provision"
  22,51,"And those who try to disable (and to discredit) Our signs, they are inhabitants of the hellfire"
  22,52,"And We did not send any messenger or prophet before you, unless when he wished (something) Satan threw (temptation) in his wish, but God eliminates anything that Satan throws, then God reaffirms His signs. God is knowledgeable and wise"
  22,53,"So that He makes whatever Satan throws a test for those who have a disease in their hearts and their hearts are hardened, and indeed the wrongdoers are in extreme opposition (to the truth)"
  22,54,"And so that those who were given the knowledge know that it (Quran) is the truth from your Master, so they believe in it and their hearts are humbled (and compliant) for it. And God certainly guides those who believed to a straight path"
  22,55,Those who disbelieved do not stop to be in doubt about it until the hour suddenly comes to them or the punishment of a barren (and hopeless) day comes to them
