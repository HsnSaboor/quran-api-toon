  44,19,"and do not (try to) rise over God, indeed I brought you a clear reason"
  44,20,"And indeed I look for protection with my Master and your Master, that you don't stone me"
  44,21,And if you do not believe me then stay away from me
  44,22,"Then he (Moses) called on his Master: indeed these are guilty people"
  44,23,"(God told Moses:) So travel with My servants by night, indeed you will be followed"
  44,24,"and leave the sea calmly, indeed they will be a drowned army"
  44,25,How many gardens and springs did they leave behind
  44,26,and plantations and superb residence
  44,27,and riches that they were happy in it
  44,28,"It was like that, and We made other people inherit it"
  44,29,"And the skies and the earth did not cry over them, and they were not given any delay"
  44,30,And We have certainly saved the children of Israel from the humiliating punishment

  44,32,And We have certainly chosen them knowingly above all other people
  44,33,"And We gave them the signs, that in which there was a clear test"
  44,34,Indeed these (people) say
  44,35,"there is only our first death, and we will not be raised (again)"
  44,36,if you are truthful then bring (back) our fathers
  44,37,"Are they better or people of Tubba and those before them? We destroyed them, indeed they were guilty"
  44,38,And We did not create the skies and the earth and whatever is between them playing around
  44,39,"We did not create them except with the truth (and purpose), but most of them do not know"
