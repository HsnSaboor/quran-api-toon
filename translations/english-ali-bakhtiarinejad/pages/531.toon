quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,"And Our command is only once, like a blink of an eye"
  54,51,"And We have certainly destroyed your kinds, so does anyone take notice"
  54,52,And everything they did is in the books
  54,53,And everything small or big is written
  54,54,And indeed those who control themselves will be in gardens and rivers
  54,55,"In a seat of truth, with a mighty ruler"
  55,1,The beneficent
  55,2,taught the Quran
  55,3,created the human being
  55,4,taught him the speech
  55,5,The sun and the moon with precisely calculated (courses)
  55,6,The herb (or the star) and the tree both humble themselves (before Him)
  55,7,And He raised the sky and set up the balance
  55,8,that you do not outdo the balance
  55,9,And perform the weighing with justice and do not make the scale light
  55,10,And He set up the earth for the human race
  55,11,in it there are fruits and palm trees having coverings
  55,12,"and the seed having outer shell, and the fragrant herbs"
  55,13,Then which of your Master’s favors do you deny
  55,14,He created the human being from dried clay like pottery clay
  55,15,And He created the Jinn from flame of a fire
  55,16,Then which of your Master’s favors do you deny
