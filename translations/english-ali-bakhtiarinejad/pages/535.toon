quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,Immortal youths circulate among them
  56,18,with drinking glasses and jugs and cups of spring water
  56,19,They do not get headache and they do not get exhausted (and drunk) from it
  56,20,And from whatever fruits they choose
  56,21,and from whatever meat of birds they desire
  56,22,and appealing girls with beautiful eyes
  56,23,like the hidden pearl (inside the shell)
  56,24,as a reward for what they used to do
  56,25,They do not hear useless or sinful (talk) in it
  56,26,"except a saying of peace (and well-being), peace (and well-being)"
  56,27,"And the associates of the right hand (the fortunate), who are the fortunate"
  56,28,Among thorn free Lote (Sidra) tree
  56,29,and banana trees piled up (with fruits)
  56,30,and extended shade
  56,31,and flowing water
  56,32,and plenty of fruits
  56,33,not ending and not forbidden
  56,34,And dignified spouses
  56,35,whom We created them perfectly
  56,36,and We made them virgins
  56,37,"devoted (and loving), of equal age"
  56,38,for associates of the right hand (the fortunate)
  56,39,a large number of the earlier ones
  56,40,and a large number of the later ones
  56,41,"And associates of the left hand (the unfortunate), who are the unfortunate"
  56,42,In scorching wind and boiling water
  56,43,and shade of thick (black) smoke
  56,44,not cool and not nice
  56,45,Indeed they were rich (and wealthy) before this
  56,46,and they insisted on the great sin
  56,47,"and they used to say: would we be raised when we die and become dust and bones"
  56,48,Or our forefathers
  56,49,"Say: indeed the earlier ones and the later ones"
  56,50,are certainly collected at an appointment of a known day
