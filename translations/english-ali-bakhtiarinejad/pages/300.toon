quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  18,54,"And We have certainly explained every kind of example for people in this Quran. And the human being, more than anything, is argumentative"
  18,55,And nothing prevented the people to believe and ask forgiveness from their Master when the guidance came to them except that (they would expect) the ways of the earlier ones come to them or the punishment comes to them face to face
  18,56,"We did not send the messengers except as givers of good news and warners. And those who disbelieved argue with falsehood to disprove the truth with it, and they took My signs and what they were warned as a joke"
  18,57,"And who is more wrong than someone who is reminded of his Master's signs then he stays away from them and forgets what his hands sent ahead (what he did). Indeed We placed a cover on their hearts that they do not understand it (Quran) and a deafness in their ears (so they don't hear it), and if you call them to the guidance they will never ever be guided"
  18,58,"And your Master is the forgiving, having mercy. If He was to take them to account for what they did, He would have certainly rushed the punishment for them, but there is an appointed time for them, from which they never find a refuge"
  18,59,"And We destroyed those towns when they did wrong, and We set an appointed time for their destruction"
  18,60,"And (remember) when Moses said to his young companion: I continue on until I reach the junction of the two seas or I go on for a long time"
  18,61,"So when they reached the junction of the two (seas), they forgot their fish and it took its way drifting into the sea"
