quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,"Those among the believers who sit around except those who are disabled, and those who try hard with their wealth and their lives in God's way are not equal. God preferred those who try hard with their wealth and their lives in rank over those who sit around. And God promised good things to each one, while God preferred those who try hard over the ones who sit around with a great reward"
  4,96,ranks and forgiveness and mercy from Him. God is forgiving and merciful
  4,97,"When angels take the life of those who were wrong to themselves, they say: what were you up to? They say: we were weak on the earth. They say: was not God’s earth vast enough so that you migrate in it? Those are whom their residence is hell, and it is a bad destination"
  4,98,Except the weak among men and women and children who cannot evade and they are not directed to a way
  4,99,And perhaps God excuses them. God is pardoning and forgiving
  4,100,"And whoever migrates in God's way finds many refuge and plenty on the earth. And whoever leaves his house migrating for God and His messenger, then the death reaches him (and he dies), then his reward has fallen upon God. And God is forgiving and merciful"
  4,101,When you travel throughout the earth there is no blame on you if you shorten your mandatory prayer if you are afraid that those who disbelieved may harm you. Indeed the disbelievers are your obvious enemy
