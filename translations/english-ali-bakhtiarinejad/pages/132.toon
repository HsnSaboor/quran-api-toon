quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,36,"Only those who listen will accept. And the dead, God raises them then they are returned to Him"
  6,37,"And they said: why a miracle of his Master was not sent down to him? Say: indeed God is able to send down a miracle, but most of them do not know"
  6,38,There is no creature on the earth or no bird flying with its two wings unless they are communities like you. We did not leave anything out of the book (Quran). And they will be gathered to their Master
  6,39,And those who denied Our signs are deaf and dumb in the darkness. God misguides anyone He wants and He places anyone He wants on a straight path (according to His law)
  6,40,"Say: what do you think, if God’s punishment comes to you or the hour comes to you, would you call upon other than God if you are truthful"
  6,41,"No, but you only call on Him, then if He wants He eliminates what you called Him on, and you forget what you associate (with Him)"
  6,42,"And We have certainly sent (messengers) to communities before you, then We took them with the suffering and the hardship so they may be humble"
  6,43,So why did they not humble when Our suffering came to them? Instead their hearts became hardened and Satan beautified for them what they were doing
  6,44,"So when they forgot what they were reminded of it, We opened doors of everything for them until they were happy about what We gave them, until We suddenly took them and then they lost hope"
