  46,6,"And when the people are gathered, they are their enemies and they deny their servitude"
  46,7,"And when Our clear signs (verses) are read to them, those who disbelieved say about the truth that comes to them: this is a clear magic"
  46,8,"Or they say: he made it up. Say: if I made it up, then you do not have any power (to do anything) for me against God, He knows better what you discuss about it, He is enough as a witness between me and you, and He is the forgiving, the merciful"
  46,9,"Say: I am not beginning (and the first) of the messengers, and I do not know what is done with me and with you, I only follow what is revealed to me, and I am only a clear warner"
  46,10,"Say: what do you thing if it (Quran) is from God and you disbelieved in it while a witness from children of Israel testified to its similarities and he believed (in it), and you were arrogant? Indeed God does not guide the wrongdoing people"
  46,11,"And those who disbelieved said to those who believed: if it was good, no one would be ahead of us (in believing) to it. And when they were not guided by it, then they are going to say: this is an old lie"
  46,12,"And book of Moses was a leader and a mercy before it, and this is a confirming book in Arabic language, in order to warn those who do wrong and as good news to the good doers"
  46,13,"Indeed those who said God is our Master, then they persevered, they have no fear and no sadness"
  46,14,"They are inhabitants of the garden, remaining in there forever, as a reward for what they were doing"
