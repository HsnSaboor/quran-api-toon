quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,38,"and those who spend their wealth to be seen by the people and do not believe in God and the last day, (Satan is their companion) and anyone who has Satan as a companion, then he has a bad companion"
  4,39,What would be against them if they believed in God and the last day and spent (in God's way) from what God provided them? God is knowledgeable about them
  4,40,"God does not wrong even the least bit, and if there is any good, He multiplies it and gives a great reward from Himself"
  4,41,And how would it be when We bring a witness from every group and We bring you as a witness against these
  4,42,"On that day, those who disbelieved and rebelled against the messenger wish that the earth was leveled with them, and they do not hide any saying (or anything) from God"
  4,43,"You who believe, do not get close to the mandatory prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you say, and not after orgasm until you wash except when you are traveling on the road, and if you are sick or on a journey or one of you comes from toilet or you had (sexual) contact with a woman and could not find water, then perform dry ablution using clean soil (or stone or sand) rubbing it to your faces and hands. God is pardoning and forgiving"
  4,44,Did you not see those who were given some benefit of the book buying the misguidance and wishing that you lose the (right) way
