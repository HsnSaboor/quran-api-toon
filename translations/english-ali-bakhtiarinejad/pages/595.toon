quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and its glow
  91,2,and by the moon when it follows it
  91,3,and by the day when it shows it
  91,4,and by the night when it covers it
  91,5,and by the sky and what built it
  91,6,and the earth and what extended it
  91,7,and by the soul and what shaped it
  91,8,and inspired it to its immoralities and its self control
  91,9,"(that) anyone who purifies it, has succeeded"
  91,10,"and anyone who corrupts it, has failed"
  91,11,Thamud denied with their rebellion
  91,12,When the most nasty of them rose up
  91,13,"then God's messenger said to them: (that is) God's female camel and her share of drink"
  91,14,"Then they denied him and killed her, then their Master fully punished them for their sins and leveled them (to the ground)"
  91,15,and He was not afraid of its outcome
  92,1,By the night when it covers
  92,2,and by the day when it shows
  92,3,and by what created the male and the female
  92,4,indeed your efforts are different
  92,5,As for anyone who gives and controls himself
  92,6,and confirms the goodness
  92,7,then We are going to get him ready for the easy way
  92,8,And as for anyone who is stingy and supposes he has no need
  92,9,and denies the goodness
  92,10,then We are going to get him ready for the difficult way
  92,11,and his wealth will be of no use when he falls (dead)
  92,12,Indeed the guidance is Our responsibility
  92,13,And the hereafter and the first (this world) belong to Us
  92,14,So I warn you of a flaming fire
