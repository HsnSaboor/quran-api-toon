  19,65,"(He is) Master of the skies and the earth and whatever between them, so serve Him and be persistent in His servitude. Do you know anyone with the same name (or attributes) as Him"
  19,66,"And the human being says: will I be brought back to life after I am dead"
  19,67,Or does the human being not remember that We created him in the past while he was nothing
  19,68,"And by your Master, We shall gather them and the devils then We shall bring them in attendance around hell on their knees"
  19,69,Then We shall pick out from every group those of them who were more unruly against the beneficent
  19,70,"And We certainly know better those who deserve it, entering (and burning)"
  19,71,And there is not any of you that will not arrive at it. This is an unavoidable decision of your Master
  19,72,"Then We save those who controlled themselves, and We leave the wrongdoers in it on their knees"
  19,73,"And when Our clear signs are read to them, those who disbelieved say to those who believed: which one of the two groups is in better position and in better company"
  19,74,And We destroyed many generations before them who were better in assets and in appearance
  19,75,"Say: anyone who is in error, then the beneficent extends an extension to him, until when they see what they are promised, either the punishment or the hour (of resurrection), then they are going to know who is in a worse position and weaker in forces"
  19,76,And God increases guidance of those who are guided. And the lasting good works has a better reward with your Master and has a better return
