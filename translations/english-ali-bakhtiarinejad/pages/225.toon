quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,"My people, I do not ask you for any wealth for it, my wage is only God's responsibility, and I do not drive away those who believed. Indeed they meet their Master, but I see you as ignorant people"
  11,30,"And my people, who helps me against God if I drive them away, do you not take notice"
  11,31,"I do not say to you that treasures of God are with me, and I do not know the unseen, and I do not say that I am an angel, and I do not say about those who are despicable in your eyes that God never gives them any good, as God knows best what is in their souls, in that case I am indeed of the wrongdoers (if I drive them away)"
  11,32,"They said: Noah, you have argued with us, and argued too much with us, so bring us what you promise us if you are truthful"
  11,33,"He said: only God brings it to you if He wants and you cannot escape (or stop) it"
  11,34,"And if I want to advise you, my advice does not benefit you if God wants to mislead you. He is your Master, and you are returned to Him"
  11,35,"Or do they say he made it up? Say: if I made that up, then my crime is on me, and I am free of your crime"
  11,36,"And it was revealed to Noah that your people will never believe except anyone who has already believed, so do not be sad by what they were doing"
  11,37,"And build the Ark under Our eyes and Our revelation, and do not speak to Me about those who did wrong, indeed they will be drowned"
