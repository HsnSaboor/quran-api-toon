quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,71,"And they thought that there will not be a test, so they turned blind and deaf (to the truth), then God turned to them (and forgave them), but many of them turned blind and deaf, and God sees what they do"
  5,72,"Those who said that the Christ, son of Mary, is God have certainly disbelieved, while Christ said: children of Israel, serve God my Master and your Master. Indeed whoever associates (any partner) with God, then God has certainly forbidden the garden to him and his place is in the fire, and there is no helper for the wrongdoers"
  5,73,"Those who said that God is one of three (Trinity) have certainly disbelieved. There is no god except the one god. And if they do not stop what they say, a painful punishment shall happen to those among them who disbelieved"
  5,74,"So why do they not repent to God and ask His forgiveness, as God is forgiving and merciful"
  5,75,"The Christ, son of Mary, was only a messenger that the messengers have passed away before him, and his mother was truthful, they both used to eat food. Look how We make the signs clear to them, then look how they deviate"
  5,76,"Say: do you serve something other than God that does not have power of any harm or any benefit for you? And God hears all and knows all"
