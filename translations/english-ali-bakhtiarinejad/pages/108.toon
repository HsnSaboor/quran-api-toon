quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,6,"You who believe, when you intend to perform the mandatory prayer, wash you faces and your hands to the elbows and wipe your head and (wipe/wash) your feet to the ankles, and if you had orgasm, then clean yourself, and if you were sick or on a journey, or one of you came from toilet, or you had (sexual) contact with a woman and could not find water then perform dry ablution using clean soil (or stone) rubbing your faces and hands with it. God does not want to make it difficult for you, but He wants to make you clean and to finish His favor upon you, so you may be thankful"
  5,7,"And remember God’s favor upon you, and His commitment that He bound you with it when you said: we hear and we obey. And be cautious of God, as indeed God knows what is inside the chests (minds)"
  5,8,"You who believe, be maintainers for God (and His commandments) and be witnesses with justice, and do not let the hatred of any group make you misbehave and that you act unjustly, be just as it is closer to self control, and be cautious of God as indeed God is well aware of what you do"
  5,9,God promised forgiveness and a great reward to those who believed and did good works
