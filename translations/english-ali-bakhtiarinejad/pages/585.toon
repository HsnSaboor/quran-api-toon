quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and turned away
  80,2,because the blind man came to him
  80,3,"And how would you know, he may purify himself"
  80,4,"or take notice, so the reminder would benefit him"
  80,5,But whoever supposes he has no need
  80,6,then you pay attention to him
  80,7,while it is not your responsibility if he did not purify
  80,8,But whoever comes to you rushing
  80,9,and he fears (God)
  80,10,then you pay no attention to him
  80,11,"No way, it (Quran) is a reminder"
  80,12,and anyone who wants takes notice from it
  80,13,In honored scriptures
  80,14,elevated and purified
  80,15,by the hands of ambassadors/scribes
  80,16,noble and good
  80,17,"Damn the human being, how ungrateful he is"
  80,18,What did He create him from
  80,19,"He created him from a fertilized egg (Zygote), then proportioned him"
  80,20,Then He made the way easy for him
  80,21,Then He made him die and had him buried
  80,22,Then He raises him when He wants
  80,23,"No way, he did not fulfill what He ordered him"
  80,24,So the human being should look at his food
  80,25,Indeed We poured the rain as shower
  80,26,then We split open the earth as cracks
  80,27,then We made grain grow in it
  80,28,and grapes and vegetable
  80,29,and olive and date
  80,30,and fenced gardens with lots of trees
  80,31,and fruit and grass
  80,32,an enjoyment for you and your livestock
  80,33,So when the deafening blast comes
  80,34,a day when the man runs away from his brother
  80,35,and his mother and his father
  80,36,and his spouse and his sons (children)
  80,37,on that day every one of them has an issue occupying him
  80,38,On that day (some) faces are bright
  80,39,laughing and joyful
  80,40,And on that day (other) faces have dust on them
  80,41,darkness covers it
  80,42,"they are the disbelievers, the immoral ones"
