quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"Those who consume usury only stand (or rise) like someone who is driven to madness by Satan’s touch. This is because they said that the sale (and doing business) is like the usury, while God permitted the sale and prohibited the usury. So anyone whom an advice from his Master came to him and he stopped, then his past (profits) is his and his case is with God, and anyone who goes back (to usury), then they will be inhabitants of the fire remaining in there forever"
  2,276,God destroys the usury and increases the charities. And God does not like any disbelieving sinner
  2,277,Those who believed and did good works and performed the mandatory prayer and gave the mandatory charity will have their reward with their Master and they have no fear and no sadness
  2,278,"You who believe, be cautious of God and leave what is left of the usury if you are believers"
  2,279,"If you do not do it (stop usury), then be informed about a war from God and His messenger, and if you repent (from usury) then your principal capital is yours, you will not be wrong and you will not be wronged"
  2,280,"And if he (the debtor) is having difficulty (financially or otherwise) then postpone until it is easy (for him to repay), and if you are charitable (and forgive the loan) it is better for you if you knew"
  2,281,"And be cautious of a day when you are returned to God in it, then every person is paid back (in full) for what they earned, and they will not be wronged"
