quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,no one enters (and burns in) it except the most unfortunate
  92,16,the one who denied and turned away
  92,17,And the more cautious (of God) are going to be kept away from it
  92,18,The one who gives his wealth to be purified
  92,19,And no one has any favor with Him to be rewarded (for it)
  92,20,"except (anyone who) looks for the attention (and pleasure) of his Master, the highest"
  92,21,and he is going to be pleased
  93,1,By the daylight
  93,2,and by the night when it quiets
  93,3,(that) your Master did not abandon you and He is not upset
  93,4,And the hereafter is certainly better for you than the first (this life)
  93,5,And your Master will certainly give you (enough) so you are pleased
  93,6,Did He not find you an orphan and sheltered you
  93,7,and found you a lost one and guided you
  93,8,and found you in need and made you needless
  93,9,"As for the orphan, do not mistreat them"
  93,10,"And as for the one who asks (the beggar), do not drive them away"
  93,11,"And as for the favor of your Master, speak of it"
  94,1,Did we not expand your chest for you
  94,2,and We rid you of your burden
  94,3,that (almost) broke your back
  94,4,and We elevated your reputation for you
  94,5,So with the difficulty (and hardship) there is ease
  94,6,Indeed with the difficulty there is ease
  94,7,"So when you are done (with your duties), then work hard (for other duties)"
  94,8,And be eager for (and be fond of) your Master
