quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,90,"No, but We brought them the truth, and they are certainly liars"
  23,91,"God did not take a child and there is no god with Him, in that case every god would take away what it created, and some of them would be superior to others. God is flawless about what they describe"

  23,95,And We are certainly able to show you what We promised them
  23,96,Repel (and respond to) the badness with that which is better. We know better about what they describe
  23,97,"And say: my Master, I look for Your protection from seductions of the devils"
  23,98,"and my Master, I look for your protection from their presence"
  23,99,"Until when the death comes to one of them, then he says: my Master, send me back"
  23,100,"so that I do good work in what I left behind (and neglected). No way, indeed it is only a word that he says it. And there is a barrier behind them until a day they are raised"
  23,101,"So when the trumpet is blown, then there is no relationship between them on that day, and they do not ask each other"
  23,102,"So those who scales are heavy, then they are the successful ones"
  23,103,"And those whose scales are light, then they are those who lost their souls, remaining in hell forever"
  23,104,"The fire burns their faces, and they frown in it"
