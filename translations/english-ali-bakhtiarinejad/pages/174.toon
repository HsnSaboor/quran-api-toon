quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  7,179,"And We have certainly created many of Jinn and humans for hell. They have hearts that they do not understand with it, and they have eyes that they do not see with it, and they have ears that they do not hear with it. They are like animals, no they are even more lost. They are the negligent ones"
  7,180,"And the good names (and attributes) belong to God, so call on Him by them, and leave those who altercate about His names, they are going to be punished for what they were doing"
  7,181,"And among those whom We created, a group guides to the truth and they carry out justice with it"
  7,182,"And those who denied Our signs, We are going to gradually lead them (to destruction and punishment) from where they do not know"
  7,183,And I give them time. Indeed My plan is sound
  7,184,Or did they not think that their friend is not mad? He is only a clear warner
  7,185,"Or did they not look at the kingdom of the skies and the earth and everything God created, and that perhaps their term is getting close? So in what saying do they believe after that (Quran)"
  7,186,"Whoever God misguides, then there is no guide for him, and He leaves them wandering in their rebellion"
  7,187,"They ask you about the hour: when is its anchor (arrival)? Say: its knowledge is only with my Master, He shall only displays it at its time, it is heavy on the skies and on the earth, it only comes to you suddenly. They ask you as if you are well informed about it. Say: its knowledge is only with God, but most people do not know"
