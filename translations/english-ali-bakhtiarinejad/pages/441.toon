quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  36,13,And give them an example of inhabitants of the town when the messengers came to it
  36,14,"When We sent them two, they denied them both, so We empowered them with a third, and they said: indeed we are sent to you"
  36,15,"They said: you are only a human being like us, and the beneficent did not send down anything, you are only lying"
  36,16,"And they said: our Master knows that indeed we are sent to you"
  36,17,and our responsibility is only the clear preaching
  36,18,"They said: we consider you as bad omen, if you do not stop, we shall stone you and a painful punishment by us shall touch you"
  36,19,"They said: your bad omen is with yourselves. Is it because you are reminded (that you say this)? No, but you are excessive people"
  36,20,"And a man came running from farthest part of the city. He said: my people, follow the messengers"
  36,21,"Follow those who do not ask you for any wage, and they are guided"
  36,22,"And why should I not serve the One who created me, and you are returned to Him"
  36,23,"Should I take gods other than Him? If the beneficent wants any harm for me, their mediation would not be of any use to me at all and they would not save me"
  36,24,"Then, I am certainly in obvious error"
  36,25,"Indeed I believed in your Master, so listen to me"
  36,26,"(After his death) he was told: enter the garden. He said: I wish my people know"
  36,27,how my Master forgave me and made me of the honored ones
