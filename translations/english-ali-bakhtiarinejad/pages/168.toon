  7,146,"I am going to turn those who are unjustifiably arrogant on the earth away from My signs. And even if they see every miracle they would not believe in it, and if they see the right way, they would not take that way, while if they see the wrong way, they would take that way. That is because they denied Our signs and they were negligent of them"
