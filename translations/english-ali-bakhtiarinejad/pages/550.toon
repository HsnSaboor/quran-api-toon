quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  60,6,"Certainly there has been a good example in them for you, for anyone who hopes for God and the last day. And anyone who turns away, then (know that) God is the rich (and without needs), the praiseworthy"
  60,7,"Perhaps God makes a friendship between you and those of them whom you were enemies, God is capable and God is forgiving and merciful"
  60,8,God does not prohibit you from being kind and fair toward those who did not fight you about the religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Indeed God likes those who are just
  60,9,"God only prohibits you from making friends with those who fought you about the religion and drove you out of your homes and supported (others) in driving you out. And anyone who makes friend with them, then they are the wrongdoers"
  60,10,"You who believe, when the believing women come to you as emigrants, then examine them, even though God knows their belief better. So if you find them as believing women, then do not return them to the disbelievers, they are not lawful for them (the disbelievers) and they (the disbelievers) are not lawful for them, and give them (the disbelievers) what they spent (for these women). And there is no blame on you if you marry them when you give them their compensations (marriage portions). And do not hold on to the (marriage) ties of disbelieving women, and ask for what you spent and they should ask for what they spent. This is God's command, He judges between you. God is knowledgeable and wise"
  60,11,"And if any of your wives goes away to the disbelievers (and they didn't pay you for what you spent), so when your turn comes, then give those (men) whose wives went away equal to what they spent. And be cautious of God, the One whom you believe in Him"
