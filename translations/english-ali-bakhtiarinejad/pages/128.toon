quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,1,"All praise belongs to God Who created the skies and the earth and made the darkness and the light, yet those who disbelieved set up equals to their Master"
  6,2,"He is the One who created you from clay, then He set a time, a finite period that is with Him, yet you still doubt"
  6,3,"He is God in the skies and on the earth, He knows your secret and what you make public and He knows what you do"
  6,4,"And any sign of their Master's signs come to them, they turn away from it"
  6,5,"They have denied the truth when it came to them, so the news of what they were ridiculing it will come to them"
  6,6,"Did they not see how many of a generation before them We destroyed which We made them powerful on the earth such that We did not make you that powerful? And We sent plenty of rain on them from the sky and We made rivers flow underneath them, then We destroyed them for their sins and We created another generation after them"
  6,7,"And if We had sent down a book to you on paper so that they had touched it with their hands, then those who disbelieved would have said: this is only an obvious magic"
  6,8,"And they said: why has not an angel been sent down to him? And if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have certainly been decided and they would not be given any delay"
