quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,50,"They (the guards) say: did not your messengers bring you the clear proofs? They say: yes. They say: so call, for call of the disbelievers is only a mistake (and is useless)"
  40,51,We certainly help Our messengers and those who believed in this world's life and on the day that witnesses stand (to testify)
  40,52,A day when the wrongdoers would not benefit from their apology and the curse would be theirs and the bad home would be theirs
  40,53,And We have certainly given Moses the guidance (the Torah) and We made children of Israel inherit the book
  40,54,a guide and a reminder for the people of understanding (reasonable people)
  40,55,"So persevere (and be patient), indeed God’s promise is true, and ask forgiveness for your sin, and glorify your Master with praise in the evening and the early morning"
  40,56,"Indeed those who argue about God's signs without any reason coming to them, there is nothing in their chests except (desire for) greatness that they will not reach it. So look for God’s protection as indeed He hears all, sees all"
  40,57,"The creation of the skies and the earth is certainly greater than creation of the people, but most of the people do not know"
  40,58,"The blinds and those who see are not equal, and neither are those who believed and did good works and the bad doer. You take a little notice"
