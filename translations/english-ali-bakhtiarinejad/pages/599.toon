quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  98,8,"Their reward with their Master is eternal gardens which rivers flow through them, remaining in there forever and ever. God is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. That is for anyone who fears his Master"
  99,1,When the earth is shaken by its earthquake
  99,2,and the earth unloads its heavy loads
  99,3,"and the human being says: what is the matter with it"
  99,4,On that day it speaks out its stories
  99,5,because your Master revealed to it
  99,6,On that day people come out in separate groups to be shown their works
  99,7,And anyone who does a tiny bit of good sees it
  99,8,and anyone who does a tiny bit of bad sees it
  100,1,"By the horses making charge, snorting"
  100,2,"and the producers of sparks, striking (their horseshoe)"
  100,3,and the attackers in the morning
  100,4,that raise cloud of dust with it
  100,5,and penetrate to the middle of it (the battle) together
  100,6,indeed the human being is ungrateful to his Master
  100,7,and he is certainly a witness to that
  100,8,and indeed his love for the good things (and wealth) is extreme
  100,9,"Does he not know that, when what is in the graves is turned upside down"
