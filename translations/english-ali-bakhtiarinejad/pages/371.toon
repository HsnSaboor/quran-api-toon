quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,and give me a good name on the tongue of the later ones (and future generations)
  26,85,and make me among inheritors of garden of the delight
  26,86,"and forgive my father, indeed he is of the lost ones"
  26,87,and do not humiliate me on a day that they are raised
  26,88,a day that wealth and children have no benefit
  26,89,except anyone who brings a sound (and pure) heart to God
  26,90,And the garden is brought near for those who control themselves
  26,91,And the hellfire is made apparent to the misled ones
  26,92,"And it is said to them: where are what you were serving"
  26,93,other than God? Can they help you or help themselves
  26,94,So they and the misled ones are thrown headfirst into it (hellfire)
  26,95,"and troops of Iblis (Satan), altogether"
  26,96,"And while they dispute about it, they say"
  26,97,by God that we were in an obvious error
  26,98,when we made you equal to the Master of Human kind
  26,99,And no one misguided us except the guilty ones
  26,100,"So, we do not have any mediators"
  26,101,and no true friend
  26,102,"And if there was a return for us (to live again), then we would become of the believers"
  26,103,"Indeed there is a sign in that, and most of them are not believers"
  26,104,And indeed your Master is the powerful and the merciful
  26,105,People of Noah denied the messengers
  26,106,"When their brother Noah said to them: would you not be cautious (of God)"
  26,107,I am an honest messenger for you
  26,108,so be cautious of God and obey me
  26,109,"And I do not ask you for any wage, for my wage is only responsibility of the Master of Human kind"
  26,110,so be cautious of God and obey me
  26,111,"They said: should we believe in you while the meanest (and the worst) follow you"
