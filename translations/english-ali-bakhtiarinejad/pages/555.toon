quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"And when they are told: come, God's messenger asks forgiveness for you. They turn their heads and you see them turn away in arrogance"
  63,6,It is the same for them whether you ask forgiveness for them or you do not ask forgiveness for them. God will never forgive them. Indeed God does not guide the disobedient people
  63,7,"They are those who say: do not spend on those who are with God's messenger until they break up. The treasures of the skies and the earth belong to God, but the hypocrites do not understand"
  63,8,"They say: if we return to Medina, the more powerful shall drive out the weaker from there. The power (and honor) belongs to God and His messenger and the believers, but the hypocrites do not know"
  63,9,"You who believe, your possessions and your children should not distract you from God's remembrance. And anyone who does that, then they are the losers"
  63,10,"And spend (in God's way) from what We provided you before death comes to one of you and he says: my Master, why did You not postpone me (my death) for a short period, so that I give to charity and be of the righteous"
  63,11,And God will never postpone (the death of) anyone when his time comes. God is well informed of what you do
