quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"Those (hypocrites) who wait for you, and if there is a victory for you from God, they say: were we not with you? And if there is a share (of victory) for the disbelievers, they say: did we not have power over you and yet we protected you from the believers. God judges between you on the resurrection day. And God will never make a way for the disbelievers over the believers"
  4,142,"Indeed the hypocrites (think that they) trick God, while He tricks them, and when they perform the mandatory prayer they perform it lazily to be seen by the people and they seldom remember God"
  4,143,"Indecisive in between that, not being of these and not of those. And whoever is misguided by God (according to His laws), you will never find a way for him"
  4,144,"You who believe, do not take the disbelievers as protectors instead of the believers. Do you want to give God a clear reason against you"
  4,145,"Indeed the hypocrites will be in the lowest level of the fire, and you will not find any helper for them"
  4,146,"except those who repented and straightened out and held on tight to God, and were sincere to God in their way of life, then they are with the believers, and God gives the believers a great reward"
  4,147,What would God do with punishing you if you are thankful and you believe? God is appreciative and knowledgeable
