quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,6,"There is no creature on the earth except its food (and provision) is God’s responsibility, and He knows its habitation and its depository (where it is buried), all is in a clear book"
  11,7,"He is the One who created the skies and the earth in six days (stages) and His kingdom is on the water, so that He tests which one of you does better work. And if you say you will be raised after the death, those who disbelieve shall say: this is only a clear magic"
  11,8,"And if We delay the punishment from them for a limited time, they shall say: what holds it back? Know that on a day that it comes to them, it will not be turned away from them, and what they used to ridicule will surround them"
  11,9,"If We make the human being taste from Our mercy, then We take it away from him, he is certainly hopeless and ungrateful"
  11,10,"And if We make him taste favor after hardship touched him, he shall say: the badness went away from me. Indeed he will be happy and proud"
  11,11,"Except those who persevered and did good works, they have forgiveness and a great reward"
  11,12,"So you may leave some of what is revealed to you, and your chest is tightened by it, because they say: why was not a treasure sent down to him or an angel came with him? You are only a warner, and God is in charge of everything"
