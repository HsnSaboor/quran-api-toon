quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,265,"Example of those who spend their wealth looking for God's pleasure and strengthening themselves is like a garden on a hill which heavy rain falls on it so it gives double of its fruit, and if a heavy rain does not fall on it, then a light rain (suffices). God sees everything you do"
  2,266,"Does any one of you like to have a garden of date palm trees and grape vines, which rivers flow through it, which has all kind of fruits in it, and he gets old having weak (or small) children, and a whirlwind with fire inside it strikes it and burns it? This is how God makes His signs clear for you, so you may think"
  2,267,"You who believe, spend (in God's way) from the good things that you earned and from what We brought out from the earth for you, and do not turn to giving away the bad (part) of it while you would not take it except with your eyes closed (being reluctant) about it. And know that God is rich (has no need) and praiseworthy"
  2,268,"Satan promises you the poverty and instructs you to the indecency, while God promises you forgiveness and grace from Him. God is bountiful and knowledgeable"
  2,269,"He gives the wisdom to whom He wants, and whoever is given the wisdom, indeed is given a lot of good, but only the people of understanding (reasonable people) take notice"
