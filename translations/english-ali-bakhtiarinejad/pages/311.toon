quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Did you see the one who disbelieved in Our signs and said: I will certainly be given wealth and children"
  19,78,Did he know the unseen or did he take a promise from the beneficent
  19,79,"Not at all, We are going to write what he says, and We extend an extension for him from the punishment"
  19,80,And We inherit from him whatever he says and he comes to Us individually
  19,81,And they took gods other than God to be (source of) power (and honor) for them
  19,82,"Not at all, they are going to deny their servitude, and will be an adversary against them"
  19,83,Did you not see that We sent the devils to the disbelievers to encourage them with encouragement
  19,84,"So do not be in a hurry against them, We only count a number for them"
  19,85,A day that We gather those who controlled themselves as a delegation to the beneficent
  19,86,and We are going to drive the guilty ones to hell in thirst
  19,87,They do not have power of the mediation except anyone who took a promise from the beneficent
  19,88,"And they said: the beneficent took a child"
  19,89,You have certainly committed a horrible thing
  19,90,And the skies are about to tear from it and the earth is about to split wide open and the mountains are about to fall down collapsing
  19,91,that they designate a child to the beneficent
  19,92,It is not becoming for the beneficent to take a child
  19,93,Everyone in the skies and the earth only come to the beneficent as servant
  19,94,He has certainly taken them into account and has counted their number
  19,95,And each of them comes to the resurrection day individually
