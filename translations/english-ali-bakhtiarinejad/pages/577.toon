quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,So mediation of the mediators does not benefit them
  74,49,So what is with them that they turn away from the reminder (Quran)
  74,50,as if they are scared donkeys
  74,51,running away from a lion
  74,52,"No, but every one of them wants to be given open papers (from God)"
  74,53,"Not at all, but they are not afraid of the hereafter"
  74,54,"Not at all, indeed it is a reminder"
  74,55,so anyone who wants takes notice of it
  74,56,"And they do not take notice unless God wants, as He is entitled to be cautioned of, and is entitled to forgive"
  75,1,I swear by the resurrection day
  75,2,and I swear by the blaming soul
  75,3,does the human being think that We will never put his bones together
  75,4,"Yes, We are able to restore his fingertips (finger prints)"
  75,5,But the human being wants to live sinfully in his time to come
  75,6,"He asks: when is the resurrection day"
  75,7,When the eye is baffled
  75,8,and the moon is darkened
  75,9,and the sun and the moon are joined together
  75,10,"On that day the human being says: where is the escape"
  75,11,"No way, there is no shelter"
  75,12,On that day the place of settlement is to your Master
  75,13,On that day the human being is informed of what he sent ahead and he put off
  75,14,But the human being has understanding about himself
  75,15,even if he presents his excuses
  75,16,Do not move your tongue with it to be in a hurry for it (to remember it)
  75,17,Indeed its collection and its reading is Our responsibility
  75,18,"So when We read it, then you follow its reading"
  75,19,Then indeed its explanation is Our responsibility
