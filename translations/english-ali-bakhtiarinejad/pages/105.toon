quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,171,"People of the book, do not exaggerate in your religion (way of life) and do not say anything from God except the truth. Jesus Christ, son of Mary, was only a messenger of God, and His word which He conveyed to Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe in God and His messengers, and do not say: three (or trinity). Stop, that is better for you. God is the only one god, He is flawless (and beyond) that there is a child for Him. Everything in the skies and in the earth belongs to him, and God is enough as an advocate"
  4,172,"Christ never refrained from being a servant of God, and neither did the closest angels. And whoever refrains from being His servant and is arrogant then He is going to gather them all to Himself (for accounting)"
  4,173,As for those who believed and did good works then He pays them their full reward and more from His grace. And as for those who refrained and were arrogant then He punishes them with a painful punishment and they will not find any protector or helper other than God for them
  4,174,"People, a proof has come to you from your Master, and We sent down a clear light (Quran) to you"
  4,175,"As for those who believed in God and held on tight to Him then He is going to admit them into His mercy and grace, and He guides them to a straight path"
