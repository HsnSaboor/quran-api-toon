quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,43,No community (of faith) gets ahead of its appointed time and they would not delay
  23,44,"Then We sent Our messengers one after the other, every time a messenger came to a community, they denied him. So We made them follow each other (to destruction), and We made them stories (for the others). So away with people who do not believe"
  23,45,Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and a clear reason
  23,46,"to Pharaoh and his assembly, but they acted arrogantly and they were bossy people"
  23,47,"They said: should we believe in two human beings like us while their people are our servants"
  23,48,So they denied them both then they became among the destroyed ones
  23,49,"And We have certainly given Moses the book, so that they may be guided"
  23,50,"And We made son of Mary and his mother a sign, and we sheltered them both on a hilltop having an accommodation and a spring (of running water)"
  23,51,"Messengers, eat from the good things and do good work, indeed I know well what you do"
  23,52,"And indeed this is your community, a single community, and I am your Master so be cautious of Me"
  23,53,"But they cut up their affair (in the religion) into pieces among them, each party happy with what they had"
  23,54,So leave them in their ignorance for a while
  23,55,Do they think that what We supplied them with it from wealth and children
  23,56,"We are rushing the goodness for them? No, they do not realize"
  23,57,Indeed those who are fearful of the awe of their Master
  23,58,and those who believe in their Master’s signs
  23,59,and those who do not associate (partners) with their Master
