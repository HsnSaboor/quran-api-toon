  24,46,"We have certainly sent down clarifying verses, and God guides anyone He wants to a straight path"

  24,50,"Is there a disease in their hearts, or do they doubt, or are they afraid that God and His messenger deal unfairly against them? No, but they are the wrongdoers"
  24,51,"Indeed word of the believers, when they are invited to God and His messenger to judge between them, is to say: we heard and we obeyed. And they are the successful ones"
  24,52,"And whoever obeys God and His messenger and fears God and is cautious of Him, then they are the victors"
  24,53,"They solemnly swear by God that if you order them they shall go out (to fight), say: do not swear, reasonable obedience (is enough), indeed God is well aware of what you do"
