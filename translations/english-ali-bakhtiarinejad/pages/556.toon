quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  64,1,"Whatever in the skies and whatever on the earth glorify God. The rule belongs to Him, and all praise belongs to Him, and He is capable of everything"
  64,2,"He is the One who created you, then some of you are disbelievers and some of you are believers. God sees whatever you do"
  64,3,"He created the skies and the earth with the truth, and He shaped you, and shaped you well, and the final return is to Him"
  64,4,"He knows whatever in the skies and on the earth, and He knows what you hide and what you disclose. God knows inside the chests"
  64,5,"Did not news of those who disbelieved in the past come to you? They tasted the bad result of their affair, and they have a painful punishment"
  64,6,"That is because their messenger brought them the clear proofs, then they said: does a human being guide us? So they disbelieved and turned away, while God does not need them, and God is rich (without needs) and praiseworthy"
  64,7,"Those who disbelieved claimed that they will never be raised. Say: yes, by my Master, you shall be raised, then you shall be informed of what you did, and that is easy for God"
  64,8,"So, believe in God and His messenger and the light which We sent down, and God is well informed of what you do"
  64,9,"A day when He gathers you for the day of gathering, that is the day of mutual loss and gain. And anyone who believes in God and does good works, He removes his sins from him and admits him to gardens which rivers flow through them, remaining in there forever and ever. That is the great victory"
