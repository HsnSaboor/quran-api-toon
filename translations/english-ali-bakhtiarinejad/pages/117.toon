quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,51,"You who believe, do not take the Jewish and the Christians as your protectors as they are protectors of each other, and whoever among you takes them as supporter then indeed he is one of them. God does not guide the wrongdoing people"
  5,52,"You see those who have disease in their hearts rush toward them saying: we are afraid that a disaster happens to us. But perhaps God brings the victory or a situation from Himself that they become regretful of what they hid in themselves"
  5,53,"And those who believed say: are these those who swore their most solemn oaths by God that they are with you? Their works became useless and they became losers"
  5,54,"You who believe, anyone among you who turns back from his way of life (is not important to God), so God brings about people whom He loves and they love Him, (they are) humble toward the believers and powerful against the disbelievers, they try hard in God's way and are not afraid of blame of anyone who blames. That is God’s grace, He gives it to anyone He wants. God is bountiful and knowledgeable"
  5,55,"Your supporter/friend is only God and His messenger and those who believed, those who perform the mandatory prayer and they give to the mandatory charity and/while they bow down (or while they are submissive)"
  5,56,"And anyone who turns to God and His messenger and those who believed (for friendship), then indeed God’s party are the winners"
  5,57,"You who believe, among those who were given the book before you and the disbelievers, do not take those who took your way of life as a joke and a game as friends . And be cautious of God if you are believers"
