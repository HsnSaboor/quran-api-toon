quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,135,"And they said: be a Jew or Christian to be guided. Say: not at all, the faith of monotheist Abraham (is enough to be guided), he was not one of the Polytheists"
  2,136,"Say: we believed in God, and what was sent down to us, and what was sent down to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes (of Israel), and what was given to Moses and Jesus, and what was given to the prophets from their Master, we do not differentiate between any of them, and we are submitted to Him"
  2,137,"And if they believe same as what you believed in it, then they are surely guided, and if they turn away, then they are certainly in opposition. God is going to suffice (to protect) you against them, and He hears all and knows all"
  2,138,"(Best way of life is) God's religion, and who is better than God (in prescribing) religion? And we are His servants"
  2,139,"Say: do you argue with us about God, while He is our Master and your Master, and our deeds are ours, and your deeds are yours, and we are only devoted to Him"
  2,140,"Or do you say that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes (of Israel) were Jewish or Christians? Say: do you know better or God? And who is more wrong than someone who hides the testimony that he has from God? God is not unaware of what you do"
  2,141,"They are people who have passed away, for them is what they did, and for you is what you did, and you will not be questioned about what they were doing"
