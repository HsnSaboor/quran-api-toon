  18,85,Then he followed a way
  18,86,"until when he reached where the sun sets, he found (perceived) it setting into a dark murky spring, and found a group of people by it. We said: Zul-Qarnain, would you punish them or would you treat them with goodness"
  18,87,"He said: as for anyone who does wrong then I will punish him, then he is returned to his Master and He punishes him with an awful punishment"
  18,88,"and as for anyone who believes and does good work, then there is the good reward for him, and we are going to issue easy order for him"
  18,89,Then he followed (another) way
  18,90,"until when he reached where the sun rises, he found it rising on a group that We did not make any cover for them other than it (the sun)"

  18,97,So they (Ya’juj and Ma’juj) could not climb it and they could not dig through it
