  6,138,"They said by their claim that these livestock and crops are forbidden and no one should eat them except anyone we want, and livestock that (riding on) their back was forbidden, and livestock that they do not mention God's name over it, fabricating (lies) against Him. He is going to punish them for what they were fabricating"
  6,139,"And they said: what is in the wombs of these livestock is exclusively for our men and is forbidden to our women, but if it is dead (at birth) then they are partners in it. He is going to punish them for their assertion. Indeed He is wise and knowledgeable"
  6,140,"Those who foolishly killed their children without any knowledge, and forbade what God provided them fabricating (lies) against God, they have lost. They have erred and they were not guided"
  6,141,"And He is the One who created gardens trellised and non-trellised, and the dates and the produce with different taste, and the olives and the pomegranates, like and unlike. Eat from its fruit when it bears fruit, and gives its dues on the day of harvest, and do not be excessive, for indeed God does not like the excessive ones"
  6,142,"And among the livestock are transporting and covering. Eat from what God provided you and do not follow Satan's footsteps, indeed he is an obvious enemy for you"
