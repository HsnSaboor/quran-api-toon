quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,89,"And when a book came to them from God confirming what is with them, even though previously they used to ask for victory over those who disbelieved, then when what they recognized came to them, they disbelieved in it. God’s curse is on the disbelievers"
  2,90,"What they sold themselves (their soul) for it, was bad, that out of jealousy they disbelieved in what God sent down, that which God sends down from His grace to any one of His servants that He wants. So they were stricken with anger upon anger, and there is a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers"
  2,91,"When they were told: believe in what God sent down, they said: we believe in what was sent down to us. And they disbelieve in anything beyond that, while it is the truth confirming what is with them (their Holy Book). Say: why did you kill God's prophets in the past, if you were believers"
  2,92,"And Moses came to you with clear proofs, then you took a calf (as god) in his absence, and you were wrongdoers"
  2,93,"And (remember) when We took your commitment and raised the mountain above you, (saying:) firmly take what We gave you, and listen. They said: we heard and we rebelled. And because of their disbelief their hearts were filled with (love of) the calf. Say: what your belief orders you to it is bad, if you are believers"
