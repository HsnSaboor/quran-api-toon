quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,170,"And when it is said to them: follow what God sent down, they say: no, we follow what we found our fathers on it. Even if their fathers did not understand anything and were not guided"
  2,171,"And the example of (inviting) those who disbelieved is like someone shouting at that which does not hear except a sound or a cry, they are deaf, dumb, and blind so they do not understand"
  2,172,"You who believe, eat from the good things that We provided for you and be thankful to God if you serve Him"
  2,173,"He has only forbidden for you the dead (animals) and the blood and meat of the pig (pork) and what is offered up (sacrificed) for other than God. And whoever is forced (to eat them) without being desirous and not exceeding, then there is no sin against him as God is forgiving and merciful"
  2,174,"Those who hide ( and do not tell others) what God has sent down in the book and sell it for a small price, they fill their stomach with nothing but fire, and God will not speak to them on the resurrection day and will not purify them, and they will have a painful punishment"
  2,175,"They traded the guidance for the misguidance, and the forgiveness for the punishment. So what is their patience against the fire"
  2,176,"That is because God sent down the book in truth, and those who disagree about the book are certainly in a great opposition"
