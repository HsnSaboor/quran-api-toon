  3,37,"Her God accepted her with best acceptance, and raised her with good upbringing, and made Zachariah her guardian. Every time Zachariah entered the chamber, he found food with her. He said: Mary, where did this come from for you? She said: from my God, indeed God provides for whom He wants without any limit"
