quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,and what is in the chests is exposed
  100,11,indeed their Master is well aware of them on that day
  101,1,The pounding disaster
  101,2,What is the pounding disaster
  101,3,And do you know what the pounding disaster is
  101,4,A day when the people become like scattered butterflies
  101,5,and the mountains become like fluffed up colored wool
  101,6,As for anyone whose balance (of good deeds) is heavy
  101,7,then he is in a pleasant life
  101,8,And as for anyone whose balance (of good deeds) is light
  101,9,then his residence is a bottomless pit
  101,10,And you don't even know what it is
  101,11,(It is) a scorching fire
  102,1,The competition for having more distracted you
  102,2,to a point that you visited the graves
  102,3,"No way, you will know"
  102,4,"And once more, no way, you will know"
  102,5,"No way, if you knew the sure knowledge (you would know that)"
  102,6,you shall see the hellfire
  102,7,then you shall see it with the sure eye
  102,8,"Then, on that day, you shall be questioned about the pleasures (you had in life)"
