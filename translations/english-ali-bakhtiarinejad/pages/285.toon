quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,28,"And if you turn away from them looking for a mercy from your Master that you hope for it, then speak to them in soft (and courteous) words"
  17,29,And do not make your hand chained to your neck (being tightfisted) and do not stretch it out to its utmost extent (being excessive) so you sit down blameworthy and regretful
  17,30,Indeed your Master increases the provision for anyone He wants and decreases it (for whom He wants). Indeed He is well informed and watchful of his servants
  17,31,"And do not kill your children for fear of poverty, as We provide for them and for you. Killing them is indeed a great sin"
  17,32,"And do not go near adultery (and fornication), indeed it is indecent and a bad way"
  17,33,"And do not kill anyone as God made it sacred (or forbidden), except in just cause. And anyone who is killed wrongfully, then We have given his heir authority (to forgive or take ransom or retaliate). So do not be excessive in the killing, indeed he is helped"
  17,34,"And do not go near orphan’s property until he reaches maturity except in the best way. And fulfill the promise, as the promise is a responsibility (and will be questioned about)"
  17,35,"And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with accurate scale. That is good and better in the end"

  17,37,"And do not walk on the earth overjoyed (and selfishly), as you will never crack the earth and you will never reach the mountains in height"
  17,38,Badness of all that is disliked by your Master
