quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  15,71,"He said: these are my daughters, if you are doers"
  15,72,"By your life, they were blindly wandering in their intoxication"
  15,73,So the awesome roar took them at sunrise
  15,74,"And We turned (the cities) upside down, and We rained stones of hard clay on them"
  15,75,Indeed there are signs in that for the clever ones
  15,76,And indeed it (the cities' ruin) remains on a road
  15,77,Indeed there is a sign in that for the believers
  15,78,And inhabitants of the woods (people of Midian) were indeed wrongdoers
  15,79,"And We took revenge from them, and they are both on a visible road"
  15,80,And inhabitants of the rock (people of Thamud) have certainly denied the messengers
  15,81,"And We gave them Our signs, but they were turning away from it"
  15,82,And they carved houses in the mountain being safe
  15,83,But the awesome roar took them in the morning
  15,84,Then what they were doing was of no use to them
  15,85,"And We did not create the skies and the earth and what is between them except with the truth, and certainly the hour is coming, so pardon them, a beautiful pardon"
  15,86,"Indeed your Master, He is the knowledgeable creator"
  15,87,We have given you seven of the repeated ones and the great Quran
  15,88,"Do not stretch out your eyes to (and be dazzled by) what We made some of them enjoy it, and do not be sad about them, and spread your wing for the believers"
  15,89,"And say: Indeed I am the clear warner"
  15,90,(Warning about) such (punishment) as We sent down on the dividers
