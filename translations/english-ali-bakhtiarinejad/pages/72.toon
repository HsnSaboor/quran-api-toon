quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,166,And what happened to you on a day that the two armies encountered (in battle of Ohod) was with God’s permission and in order to know the believers
  3,167,"and in order to know the hypocrites. And they were told: come, fight in God's way or defend (yourselves). They said: if we knew how to fight, we would certainly follow you. In that day they were closer to the disbelief than to the belief. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts. And God knows better what they hide"
  3,168,"To those who stayed behind and said about their brothers that if they had obeyed us, they would not have been killed, say: turn away the death from yourselves if you are truthful"
  3,169,"And do not think of those who were killed in God's way as dead, but they are alive and have provisions with their Master"
  3,170,"enjoying from what God gave them from His grace and being happy about those left behind them who have not joined them yet, (knowing that) there is no fear and no sadness for them"
  3,171,"They are glad about God’s favor and grace, and that God does not waste reward of the believers"
  3,172,"those who accepted the call of God and His messenger after being wounded, for those among them who did good and controlled themselves there is a great reward"
  3,173,"Those who when the people told them that the people have gathered against you, so be afraid of them, it increased their belief and they said: God is enough for us, and He is the best advocate"
