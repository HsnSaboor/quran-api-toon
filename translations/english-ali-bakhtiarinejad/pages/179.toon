quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  8,17,"You did not kill them, but God killed them, and you did not shoot when you shot, but God shot. He tests the believers with a good test from Himself. God hears all and knows all"
  8,18,"That is how it is, and God weakens the plot of the disbelievers"
  8,19,"If you look for victory, indeed the victory came to you, but if you stop (hostilities), that is better for you. If you return (to your old ways), We also return (and will not help you), and your forces will never be of benefit to you at all, no matter how numerous. And God is with the believers"
  8,20,"You who believe, obey God and His messenger, and do not turn away from him while you hear (him)"
  8,21,"And do not be like those who said we hear, while they do not listen"
  8,22,"The worst creatures in God’s view are the deaf and the dumb, those who do not understand"
  8,23,"If God knew of any good in them, He would make them listen, and (even) if He made them listen, they would turn back and they avoid"
  8,24,"You who believe, answer the call of God and His messenger when he calls you to what gives you life, and know that God comes between the person and his heart, and you will be gathered to Him"
  8,25,And be cautious of a trial that does not exclusively happen to those who did wrong among you. And know that God is severe in punishment
