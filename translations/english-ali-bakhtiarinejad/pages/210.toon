quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,15,"When Our clear signs are read to them, those who do not expect to meet Us, say: bring a Quran other than this or change it. Say: it is not for me to change it on my own accord, I only follow what is revealed to me, indeed I am afraid of the punishment of a great day if I disobey my Master"
  10,16,"Say: if God wanted, I would not have read it to you, and He would not have made you know it, and I have stayed among you a lifetime before that, do you not understand"
  10,17,Who is more wrong than someone who makes up a lie (and attributes it) to God or denies His signs? Indeed the guilty ones do not succeed
  10,18,"And they serve, other than God, that which does not harm them and does not benefit them, and they say: these are our mediators before God. Say: do you inform God of something that He does not know in the skies or on the earth? He is flawless and is above what they associate (with Him)"
  10,19,"People were only a single community then they disagreed, and if it was not for a word that previously issued from your Master, it would have been judged between them about what they disagreed about it"
  10,20,"And they say: why a miracle was not send down to him from his Master? Say: the unseen is only for God (to know), so wait and I am with you among those who wait"
