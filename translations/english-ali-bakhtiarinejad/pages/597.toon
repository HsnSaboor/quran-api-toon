quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the fig and the olive
  95,2,and by mount Sinai
  95,3,and by this safe land
  95,4,(that) We have certainly created the human being in the best form
  95,5,then We returned him to the lowest of low
  95,6,"except those who believed and did good works, so there is an unending reward for them"
  95,7,So what makes you deny the way of life (or the judgment day) after this
  95,8,Is not God the wisest of the judges
  96,1,"Read in the name of your Master, the One who created"
  96,2,"created the human being from a (dangling, clinging, and leach like) blood clot"
  96,3,Read and (know that) your Master is the most noble
  96,4,the One who taught by the pen
  96,5,He taught the human being what he did not know
  96,6,"No way, the human being shall certainly rebel"
  96,7,if he sees himself as having no need
  96,8,Indeed the return is to your Master
  96,9,Did you see the one who forbids
  96,10,a servant when he performs mandatory prayer
  96,11,Did you see if he is on the guidance
  96,12,or he orders to self control (against unlawful desires and sins)
  96,13,Did you see if he denied and turned away
  96,14,Did he not know that God sees (everything)
  96,15,"No way, if he does not stop (this behavior) We shall grab him by the forelock"
  96,16,a sinful lying forelock
  96,17,Then he should call on his peers
  96,18,(and) We are going to call on the guards of hell
  96,19,"No way, do not obey him, and show humbleness and get close (to God)"
