quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  38,43,We gave him back his family and the same again with them as a mercy from Us and a reminder for people of intellect
  38,44,´Take a bundle of rushes in your hand and strike with that but do not break your oath.´ We found him steadfast. What an excellent slave! He truly turned to his Lord
  38,45,"And remember Our slaves Ibrahim, Ishaq and Ya´qub, men of true strength and inner sight"
  38,46,We purified their sincerity through sincere remembrance of the Abode
  38,47,In Our eyes they are among the best of chosen men
  38,48,"Remember Our slaves Isma´il, Al-Yasa´ and Dhu´l-Kifl; each of them was among the best of men"
  38,49,This is a Reminder. Those who have taqwa will have a good Homecoming
  38,50,"Gardens of Eden, whose gates will be open to them"
  38,51,"where they will recline, calling for plentiful fruit and drink"
  38,52,and there will be dark-eyed maidens with them with eyes reserved for them alone
  38,53,This is what you are promised on the Day of Reckoning
  38,54,This is Our provision which will never run out
  38,55,This! Whereas for the profligate there is an evil Homecoming
  38,56,"Hell, where they will roast. What an evil resting-place"
  38,57,This! So let them taste it — boiling water and scalding pus
  38,58,and other such torments
  38,59,This! A crowd hurtling in with you. There is no welcome for them. They will certainly roast in the Fire
  38,60,"They will say, ´No, it is you who have no welcome. It is you who brought it upon us. What an evil place to settle!´"
  38,61,"They will say, ´Our Lord, give him who brought this on us double the punishment in the Fire!´"
