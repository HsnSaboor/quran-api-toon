quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"Their likeness is that of people who light a fire, and then when it has lit up all around them, Allah removes their light and leaves them in darkness, unable to see"
  2,18,"Deaf, dumb, blind. They will not return"
  2,19,"Or that of a storm-cloud in the sky, full of darkness, thunder and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps, fearful of death. Allah encompasses the kafirun"
  2,20,"The lightning all but takes away their sight. Whenever they have light, they walk in it but whenever darkness covers them, they halt. If Allah wished, He could take away their hearing and their sight. Allah has power over all things"
  2,21,"Mankind! worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, so that hopefully you will have taqwa"
  2,22,"It is He who made the earth a couch for you, and the sky a dome. He sends down water from the sky and by it brings forth fruits for your provision. Do not, then, knowingly make others equal to Allah"
  2,23,"If you have doubts about what We have sent down to Our slave, produce another sura equal to it, and call your witnesses, besides Allah, if you are telling the truth"
  2,24,"If you do not do that — and you will not do it — then fear the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, made ready for the kafirun"
