quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  37,77,and made his descendants the survivors
  37,78,and We left the later people to say of him
  37,79,´Peace be upon Nuh among all beings!´
  37,80,That is how we recompense the good-doers
  37,81,He truly was one of Our slaves who are muminun
  37,82,Then We drowned the rest
  37,83,One of his followers in iman was Ibrahim
  37,84,when he came to his Lord with an unblemished heart
  37,85,"and said to his father and his people, ´What are you worshipping"
  37,86,Is it falsehood — gods besides Allah — that you desire
  37,87,So what are your thoughts about the Lord of all the worlds?´
  37,88,He took a look at the stars
  37,89,"and said, ´I am sick.´"
  37,90,So they turned their backs on him
  37,91,"He turned surreptitiously to their gods and said, ´Do you not eat"
  37,92,What is the matter with you that you do not speak?´
  37,93,"He turned on them, striking out with his right hand"
  37,94,They came rushing back to him
  37,95,"He said, ´Do you worship something you have carved"
  37,96,when Allah created both you and what you do?´
  37,97,"They said, ´Build a pyre for him and fling him into the blaze!´"
  37,98,They tried to outwit him but We made them the lowest
  37,99,"He said, ´I am going towards my Lord; He will be my guide"
  37,100,"My Lord, bestow on me a right-acting child!´"
  37,101,And We gave him the good news of a forbearing boy
  37,102,"When he was of an age to work with him, he said, ´My son, I saw in a dream that I must sacrifice you. What do you think about this?´ He said, ´Do as you are ordered, father. Allah willing, you will find me resolute.´"
