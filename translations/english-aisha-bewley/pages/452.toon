quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you? How do you reach your judgement
  37,155,Will you not pay heed
  37,156,Or do you have some clear authority
  37,157,"Bring your Book, then, if you are telling the truth"
  37,158,They claim there is a blood-tie between Him and the jinn but the jinn know very well that they will be arraigned
  37,159,Glory be to Allah above what they describe —
  37,160,except for Allah´s chosen slaves
  37,161,You and those you worship
  37,162,you will entice no one to them
  37,163,except for him who is to roast in the Blazing Fire
  37,164,´There is not one of us who does not have a known station
  37,165,We are those drawn up in ranks
  37,166,We are those who glorify.´
  37,167,They used to say
  37,168,´If we had only had a Reminder from the previous peoples
  37,169,we would certainly have been sincere slaves of Allah!´
  37,170,But they have rejected it and they will soon know
  37,171,"Our Word was given before to Our slaves, the Messengers"
  37,172,that they would certainly be helped
  37,173,It is Our army which will be victorious
  37,174,Therefore turn from them for a time
  37,175,"And watch them, for they will soon see"
  37,176,Are they trying to hasten Our punishment
  37,177,When it descends in their courtyard — how evil will be the morning of those who were warned
  37,178,Therefore turn from them for a time
  37,179,"And watch, for they will soon see"
  37,180,"Glory be to your Lord, the Lord of Might, beyond anything they describe"
  37,181,And peace be upon the Messengers
  37,182,"And praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds"
