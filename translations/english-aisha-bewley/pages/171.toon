quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  7,160,"We divided them up into twelve tribes — communities. We revealed to Musa, when his people asked him for water: ´Strike the rock with your staff.´ Twelve fountains flowed out from it and all the people knew their drinking place. And We shaded them with clouds and sent down manna and quails to them: ´Eat of the good things We have provided you with.´ They did not wrong Us; rather it was themselves they wronged"
  7,161,"When they were told: ´Live in this town and eat of it wherever you like and say, \"Relieve us of our burdens!\" and enter the gate prostrating. Your mistakes will be forgiven you. We will grant increase to good-doers.´"
  7,162,But those of them who did wrong substituted words other than those they had been given. So We sent a plague on them from heaven for their wrongdoing
  7,163,Ask them about the town which was by the sea when they broke the Sabbath — when their fish came to them near the surface on their Sabbath day but did not come on the days which were not their Sabbath. In this way We put them to the test because they were deviators
