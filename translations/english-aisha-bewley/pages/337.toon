quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,39,Permission to fight is given to those who are fought against because they have been wronged — truly Allah has the power to come to their support —
  22,40,"those who were expelled from their homes without any right, merely for saying, ´Our Lord is Allah´ (if Allah had not driven some people back by means of others, monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques, where Allah´s name is mentioned much, would have been pulled down and destroyed. Allah will certainly help those who help Him — Allah is All-Strong, Almighty)"
  22,41,"those who, if We establish them firmly on the earth, will establish salat and pay zakat, and command what is right and forbid what is wrong. The end result of all affairs is with Allah"
  22,42,"If they deny you, the people of Nuh before them denied him and those of ´Ad and of Thamud"
  22,43,and the people of Ibrahim and the people of Lut
  22,44,and the companions of Madyan; and Musa was denied as well. I allowed time to the kafirun but then I seized them. How terrible was My denial
  22,45,"How many wrongdoing cities We destroyed, and now all their roofs and walls are fallen in; how many abandoned wells and stuccoed palaces"
  22,46,Have they not travelled about the earth and do they not have hearts to understand with or ears to hear with? It is not their eyes which are blind but the hearts in their breasts which are blind
