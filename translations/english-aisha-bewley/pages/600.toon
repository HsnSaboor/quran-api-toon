quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,and the heart´s contents are brought into the open
  100,11,that Day their Lord will certainly be aware of them
  101,1,The Crashing Blow
  101,2,What is the Crashing Blow
  101,3,What will convey to you what the Crashing Blow is
  101,4,It is the Day when mankind will be like scattered moths
  101,5,and the mountains like tufts of coloured wool
  101,6,As for him whose balance is heavy
  101,7,he will have a most pleasant life
  101,8,But as for him whose balance is light
  101,9,his motherland is Hawiya
  101,10,And what will convey to you what that is
  101,11,A raging Fire
  102,1,Fierce competition for this world distracted you
  102,2,until you went down to the graves
  102,3,"No indeed, you will soon know"
  102,4,"Again no indeed, you will soon know"
  102,5,"No indeed, if you only knew with the Knowledge of Certainty"
  102,6,you will certainly see the Blazing Fire
  102,7,Then you will certainly see it with the Eye of Certainty
  102,8,Then you will be asked that Day about the pleasures you enjoyed
