quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,170,"When they are told, ´Follow what Allah has sent down to you,´ They say, ´We are following what we found our fathers doing.´ What, even though their fathers did not understand a thing and were not guided"
  2,171,The likeness of those who are kafir is that of someone who yells out to something which cannot hear — it is nothing but a cry and a call. Deaf — dumb — blind. They do not use their intellect
  2,172,You who have iman! eat of the good things We have provided for you and give thanks to Allah if you worship Him alone
  2,173,"He has only forbidden you carrion, blood and pork and what has been consecrated to other than Allah. But anyone who is forced to eat it — without desiring it or going to excess in it — commits no crime. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  2,174,"Those who conceal what Allah has sent down of the Book and sell it cheap, take nothing into their bellies but the Fire. On the Day of Rising Allah will not speak to them or purify them. They will have a painful punishment"
  2,175,Those are the ones who have sold guidance for misguidance and forgiveness for punishment. How steadfastly they will endure the Fire
  2,176,That is because Allah has sent down the Book with truth and those who differ from the Book are entrenched in hostility
