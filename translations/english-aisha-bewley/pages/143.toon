quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,119,"What is the matter with you that you do not eat that over which the name of Allah has been mentioned, when He has made clear to you what He has made haram for you except when you are forced to eat it? Many people lead themselves astray through their whims and desires without having any knowledge. Your Lord knows best those who overstep the limits"
  6,120,"Abandon wrong action, outward and inward. Those who commit wrong action will be repaid for what they perpetrated"
  6,121,Do not eat anything over which the name of Allah has not been mentioned. To do so is sheer deviance. The shaytans inspire their friends to dispute with you. If you obeyed them you would then be idolaters
  6,122,"Is someone who was dead and whom We brought to life, supplying him with a light by which to walk among people, the same as someone who is in utter darkness, unable to emerge from it? That is how what they were doing is made to seem attractive to the kafirun"
  6,123,"And likewise in every city We set up its greatest wrongdoers to plot in it. They plot against themselves alone, but they are not aware of it"
  6,124,"When a Sign comes to them, they say, We will not have iman until we have been given the same as the Messengers of Allah were given.´ Allah knows best where to place His Message. Debasement in the sight of Allah and a severe punishment will strike those who did wrong for the plots that they concocted"
