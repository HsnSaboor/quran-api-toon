quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and turned away
  80,2,because the blind man came to him
  80,3,But how do you know? Perhaps he would be purified
  80,4,"or reminded, and the reminder benefit him"
  80,5,As for him who thinks himself self-sufficient
  80,6,you give him your complete attention
  80,7,but it is not up to you whether or not he is purified
  80,8,But as for him who comes to you eagerly
  80,9,showing fearfulness
  80,10,from him you are distracted
  80,11,No indeed! Truly it is a reminder
  80,12,and whoever wills pays heed to it
  80,13,Inscribed on Honoured Pages
  80,14,"exalted, purified"
  80,15,by the hands of scribes
  80,16,"noble, virtuous"
  80,17,Curse man for his ingratitude
  80,18,From what thing did He create him
  80,19,From a drop of sperm He created him and proportioned him
  80,20,Then He eases the way for him
  80,21,Then He causes him to die and buries him
  80,22,"Then, when He wills, He raises him from the dead"
  80,23,No indeed! He has not done what He ordered him
  80,24,Man has only to look at his food
  80,25,We pour down plentiful water
  80,26,then split the earth into furrows
  80,27,Then We make grain grow in it
  80,28,and grapes and herbs
  80,29,and olives and dates
  80,30,and luxuriant gardens
  80,31,and orchards and meadows
  80,32,for you and your livestock to enjoy
  80,33,When the Deafening Blast comes
  80,34,the Day a man will flee from his brother
  80,35,and his mother and his father
  80,36,and his wife and his children
  80,37,on that Day every man among them will have concerns enough of his own
  80,38,That Day some faces will be radiant
  80,39,"laughing, rejoicing"
  80,40,That Day some faces will be dust-covered
  80,41,overcast with gloom
  80,42,Those are the dissolute kafirun
