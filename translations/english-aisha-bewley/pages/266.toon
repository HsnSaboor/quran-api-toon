quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  15,71,"He said, ´Here are my daughters if you are determined to do something.´"
  15,72,By your life! They were wandering blindly in their drunkenness
  15,73,So the Great Blast seized hold of them at the break of day
  15,74,We turned the place completely upside down and rained down on them stones of hard-baked clay
  15,75,There are certainly Signs in that for the discerning
  15,76,They were beside a road which still exists
  15,77,There is certainly a Sign in that for the muminun
  15,78,The people of the Thicket* were also wrongdoers
  15,79,We took revenge on them as well. They are both beside a well-beaten track
  15,80,The people of al-Hijr denied the Messengers
  15,81,We brought them Our Signs but they turned away from them
  15,82,"They carved out houses from the mountains, feeling safe"
  15,83,but the Great Blast seized hold of them in the morning
  15,84,so all that they earned was of no use to them
  15,85,"We did not create the heavens and earth and everything between them, except with truth. The Hour is certainly coming, so turn away graciously"
  15,86,"Your Lord, He is the Creator, the All-Knowing"
  15,87,We have given you the Seven Oft-repeated* and the Magnificent Qur´an
  15,88,Do not direct your eyes longingly to what We have given certain of them to enjoy. Do not feel sad concerning them. And take the muminun under your wing
  15,89,"Say: ´I am indeed a clear warner.´"
  15,90,Just as We sent down punishment on the dissectors
