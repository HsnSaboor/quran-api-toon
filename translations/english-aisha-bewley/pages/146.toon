quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,138,"They say, ´These animals and crops are sacrosanct. No one may eat them except those we wish´, — as they allege — and animals on whose backs it is forbidden to ride, and animals over which they do not mention Allah´s name, inventing falsehood against Him. He will repay them for the things they have invented"
  6,139,"They say, ´What is in the wombs of these animals is exclusively for our men and haram for our wives. But if it is stillborn, they can share in it.´ He will repay them for their false depiction. He is All-Wise, All-Knowing"
  6,140,"Those who kill their children foolishly without any knowledge and make what Allah has provided for them haram, inventing lies against Allah, such people are lost. They are misguided. They are not guided"
  6,141,"It is He who produces gardens, both cultivated and wild, and palm-trees and crops of diverse kinds, and olives and pomegranates, both similar and dissimilar. Eat of their fruits when they bear fruit and pay their due on the day of their harvest, and do not be profligate. He does not love the profligate"
  6,142,And also animals for riding and for haulage and animals for slaughtering and for wool. Eat what Allah has provided for you and do not follow in the footsteps of Shaytan. He is an outright enemy to you
