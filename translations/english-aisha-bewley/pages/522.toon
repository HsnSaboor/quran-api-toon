quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"He inquired, ´What, then, is your business, messengers?´"
  51,32,"They said, ´We have been sent to a people of evildoers"
  51,33,to unleash upon them lumps of clay
  51,34,earmarked by your Lord for the profligate.´
  51,35,We brought out all the muminun who were there
  51,36,but found in it only one house of Muslims
  51,37,And We left a Sign in it for those who fear the painful punishment
  51,38,And also in Musa when We sent him to Pharaoh with clear authority
  51,39,"But he turned away with his forces, saying, ´A magician or a madman!´"
  51,40,"So We seized him and his armies and hurled them into the sea, and he was to blame"
  51,41,And also in ´Ad when We unleashed against them the barren wind
  51,42,which left nothing it touched without turning it to dust
  51,43,"And also in Thamud, when they were told: ´Enjoy yourselves a while!´"
  51,44,"But they spurned their Lord´s command, so the Blast seized them as they looked"
  51,45,They could not stand upright and they were not helped
  51,46,"And the people of Nuh before, they were a people of deviators"
  51,47,As for heaven — We built it with great power and gave it its vast expanse
  51,48,And the earth — We spread it like a carpet and how well We smoothed it out
  51,49,And We created all things in pairs so that hopefully you would pay heed
  51,50,So flee to Allah. Truly I bring you a clear warning from Him
  51,51,Do not set up another god together with Allah. Truly I bring you a clear warning from Him
