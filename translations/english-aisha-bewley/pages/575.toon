quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Your Lord knows that you stay up nearly two-thirds of the night — or half of it, or a third of it — and a group of those with you. Allah determines the night and day. He knows you will not keep count of it, so He has turned towards you. Recite as much of the Qur´an as is easy for you. He knows that some of you are ill and that others are travelling in the land seeking Allah´s bounty, and that others are fighting in the Way of Allah. So recite as much of it as is easy for you. And establish salat and pay zakat and lend a generous loan to Allah. Whatever good you send ahead for yourselves you will find it with Allah as something better and as a greater reward. And seek forgiveness from Allah. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  74,1,You who are enveloped in your cloak
  74,2,Arise and warn
  74,3,Magnify your Lord
  74,4,Purify your clothes
  74,5,Shun all filth
  74,6,Do not give out of a desire for gain
  74,7,Be steadfast for your Lord
  74,8,For when the Trumpet is blown
  74,9,that Day will be a difficult day
  74,10,not easy for the kafirun
  74,11,Leave the person I created on his own to Me alone
  74,12,him to whom I have given great wealth
  74,13,and sons who stay with him
  74,14,and whose way I have smoothed
  74,15,Then he wants Me to add yet more
  74,16,No indeed! He is obdurate about Our Signs
  74,17,I will force him to climb a fiery slope
