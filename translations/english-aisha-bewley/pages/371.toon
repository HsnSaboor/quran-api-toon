quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,and make me highly esteemed among the later peoples
  26,85,and make me one of the inheritors of the Garden of Delight
  26,86,and forgive my father — he was one of the misguided
  26,87,and do not disgrace me on the Day they are raised up
  26,88,the Day when neither wealth nor sons will be of any use —
  26,89,except to those who come to Allah with sound and flawless hearts.´
  26,90,The Garden will be brought near to those who have taqwa
  26,91,The Blazing Fire will be displayed to the misled
  26,92,"They will be asked, ´Where are those you used to worship besides Allah"
  26,93,Can they help you or even help themselves?´
  26,94,"They will be bundled into it head first, they and the misled"
  26,95,and every one of Iblis´s regiments
  26,96,"Arguing in it with one another, they will say"
  26,97,"´By Allah, we were plainly misguided"
  26,98,when We equated you with the Lord of all the worlds
  26,99,It was only the evildoers who misguided us
  26,100,and now we have no one to intercede for us
  26,101,we do not have a single loyal friend
  26,102,If only we could have another chance then we would be among the muminun!´
  26,103,"There is certainly a Sign in that, yet most of them are not muminun"
  26,104,"Truly your Lord is the Almighty, the Most Merciful"
  26,105,The people of Nuh denied the Messengers
  26,106,"When their brother Nuh said to them, ´Will you not have taqwa"
  26,107,I am a faithful Messenger to you
  26,108,so have taqwa of Allah and obey me
  26,109,I do not ask you for any wage for it. My wage is the responsibility of no one but the Lord of all the worlds
  26,110,so have taqwa of Allah and obey me.´
  26,111,"they said, ´Why should we believe you when the vilest people follow you?´"
