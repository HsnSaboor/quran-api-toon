quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,Therefore here today he has no friend
  69,36,nor any food except exuding pus
  69,37,which no one will eat except those who were in error.´
  69,38,I swear both by what you see
  69,39,and what you do not see
  69,40,that this is the word of a noble Messenger
  69,41,It is not the word of a poet — how little iman you have
  69,42,Nor the word of a fortune-teller — how little heed you pay
  69,43,It is a revelation from the Lord of all the worlds
  69,44,If he had made up any sayings and ascribed them to Us
  69,45,We would have seized him by force
  69,46,and then We would have cut off his life-blood
  69,47,and not one of you could have protected him
  69,48,It is a reminder to the people with taqwa
  69,49,We know that some of you will deny it
  69,50,It is a cause of great distress to those who are kafir
  69,51,And it is undeniably the Truth of Certainty
  69,52,"Glorify then the name of your Lord, the Magnificent"
  70,1,An inquirer asked about an impending punishment
  70,2,It is for the kafirun and cannot be averted
  70,3,from Allah — the Lord of the Ascending Steps
  70,4,The angels and the Spirit ascend to Him in a day whose length is fifty thousand years
  70,5,Therefore be patient with a patience which is beautiful
  70,6,They see it as something distant
  70,7,but We see it as very close
  70,8,On the Day the sky is like molten brass
  70,9,and the mountains like tufts of coloured wool
  70,10,no good friend will ask about his friend
