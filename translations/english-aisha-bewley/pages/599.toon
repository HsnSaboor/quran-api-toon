quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  98,8,"Their reward is with their Lord: Gardens of Eden with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever and ever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. That is for those who fear their Lord"
  99,1,When the earth is convulsed with its quaking
  99,2,and the earth then disgorges its charges
  99,3,"and man asks, ´What is wrong with it?´"
  99,4,on that Day it will impart all its news
  99,5,because your Lord has inspired it
  99,6,That Day people will emerge segregated to see the results of their actions
  99,7,Whoever does an atom´s weight of good will see it
  99,8,Whoever does an atom´s weight of evil will see it
  100,1,By the charging horses panting hard
  100,2,striking sparks from their flashing hooves
  100,3,raiding at full gallop in the early dawn
  100,4,leaving a trailing dust-cloud in their wake
  100,5,cleaving through the middle of the foe
  100,6,truly man is ungrateful to his Lord
  100,7,and indeed he bears witness to that
  100,8,Truly he is fierce in his love of wealth
  100,9,Does he not know that when the graves are emptied out
