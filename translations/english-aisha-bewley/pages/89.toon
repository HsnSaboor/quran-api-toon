quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  4,66,"If We had directed them to kill themselves or leave their homes, they would not have done so, except for a very few. But if they had done what they were urged to do, it would have been better for them and far more strengthening"
  4,67,In that case We would have given them an immense reward from Us
  4,68,and We would have guided them on a straight path
  4,69,"Whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger will be with those whom Allah has blessed: the Prophets and the true, the martyrs and the righteous. What excellent company such people are"
  4,70,That is favour from Allah. Allah suffices as a Knower
  4,71,"You who have iman! take all necessary precautions, then go out to fight in separate groups or go out as one body"
  4,72,"Among you there are people who hang back and if you encounter a setback then they say, ´Allah has blessed me in that I was not there with them.´"
  4,73,But if you meet with favour from Allah they say — as if there were no friendship between you and them — ´Oh! If only I had been with them so that I too might have won a great victory.´
  4,74,"So let those who sell the life of this world for the Next World fight in the Way of Allah. If someone fights in the Way of Allah, whether he is killed or is victorious, We will pay him an immense reward"
