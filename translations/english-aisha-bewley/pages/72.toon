quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,166,"What assailed you on the day the two armies met was by Allah´s permission, so that He would know the muminun"
  3,167,"and so that He would know the hypocrites. They were told, ´Come and fight in the Way of Allah or at least help defend us.´ They said, ´If we knew there would be a fight, we would certainly follow you.´ They were closer to kufr that day than to iman, saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts. And Allah knows best what they are hiding"
  3,168,"They are those who said of their brothers, when they themselves had stayed behind, ´If they had only obeyed us, they would not have been killed.´ Say, ´Then ward off death from yourselves if you are telling the truth.´"
  3,169,Do not suppose that those killed in the Way of Allah are dead. No indeed! They are alive and well provided for in the very presence of their Lord
  3,170,"delighting in the favour Allah has bestowed on them, rejoicing over those they left behind who have not yet joined them, feeling no fear and knowing no sorrow"
  3,171,rejoicing in blessings and favour from Allah and that Allah does not let the wage of the muminun go to waste
  3,172,Those who did good and had taqwa among those who responded to Allah and the Messenger after the wound had been inflicted will have an immense reward
  3,173,"those to whom people said, ´The people have gathered against you, so fear them.´ But that merely increased their iman and they said, ´Allah is enough for us and the Best of Guardians.´"
