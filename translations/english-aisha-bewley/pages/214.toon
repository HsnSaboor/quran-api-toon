quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  10,43,"Among them there are some who look at you. But can you guide the blind, even though they cannot see"
  10,44,Allah does not wrong people in any way; rather it is people who wrong themselves
  10,45,On the day We gather them together — when it will seem if they had tarried no more than an hour of a single day — they will recognise one another. Those who denied the meeting with Allah will have lost. They were not guided
  10,46,"Whether We show you something of what We have promised them or take you back to Us, they will still return to Us. Then Allah will be witness against what they are doing"
  10,47,Every nation has a Messenger and when their Messenger comes everything is decided between them justly. They are not wronged
  10,48,"They say, ´When will this promise be kept if you are telling the truth?´"
  10,49,"Say: ´I possess no power to harm or help myself except as Allah wills. Every nation has an appointed time. When their appointed time comes, they cannot delay it a single hour or bring it forward.´"
  10,50,"Say: ´What do you think? If His punishment came upon you by night or day, what part of it would the evildoers then try to hasten?´"
  10,51,"And then, when it actually comes about: ´Now do you have iman in it? It was this that you were trying to hasten!´"
  10,52,"Then it will be said to those who did wrong, ´Taste the punishment of eternity! Have you been repaid for anything other than what you earned?´"
  10,53,"They will ask you to tell them if this is true. Say: ´Yes indeed, by my Lord, it certainly is true and you can do nothing to prevent it.´"
