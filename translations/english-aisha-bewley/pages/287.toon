quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  17,50,"Say: ´It would not matter if you were rock or iron"
  17,51,"Or indeed any created thing that you think is harder still!´ They will say, ´Who will bring us back again?´ Say: ´He who brought you into being in the first place.´ They will shake their heads at you and ask, ´When will it happen?´ Say: ´It may well be that it is very near.´"
  17,52,"On the Day He calls you, you will respond by praising Him and think that you have only tarried a very short time"

  17,54,"Your Lord knows you best. If He wills, He will have mercy on you, and, if He wills, He will punish you. We did not send you to be their guardian"
  17,55,My Lord knows best everyone in the heavens and earth. We favoured some of the Prophets over others. And We gave Dawud the Zabur
  17,56,"Say: ´Call on those you make claims for apart from Him. They possess no power to remove any harm from you or to change anything.´"

  17,58,"There is no city We will not destroy before the Day of Rising, or punish with a terrible punishment. That is inscribed in the Book"
