quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,135,"You who have iman! be upholders of justice, bearing witness for Allah alone, even against yourselves or your parents and relatives. Whether they are rich or poor, Allah is well able to look after them. Do not follow your own desires and deviate from the truth. If you twist or turn away, Allah is aware of what you do"
  4,136,"You who have iman! have iman in Allah and His Messenger and in the Book He sent down to His Messenger, and the Books He sent down before. Anyone who rejects Allah and His angels and His Books and His Messengers and the Last Day has gone very far astray"
  4,137,"As for those who have iman and then return to kufr, and then again have iman and then return to kufr, and then increase in kufr, Allah will not forgive them or guide them on any path"
  4,138,Give news to the hypocrites that they will have a painful punishment
  4,139,"Do those who take the kafirun as protectors, rather than the muminun, hope to find power and strength with them? Power and strength belong entirely to Allah"
  4,140,"It has been sent down to you in the Book that when you hear Allah´s Signs being rejected and mocked at by people, you must not sit with them till they start talking of other things. If you do you are just the same as them. Allah will gather all the hypocrites and kafirun into Hell"
