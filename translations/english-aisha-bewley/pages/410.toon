quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"But if We send a wind, and they see it turning yellow, still they persist after that in being kafir"
  30,52,"You will not make dead men hear; you will not make deaf men hear the call, when they turn their backs in flight"
  30,53,You will not guide blind men from their misguidance. You will not make anyone hear except for those who have iman in Our Signs and so are Muslims
  30,54,"It is Allah who created you from a weak beginning then after weakness gave you strength then after strength ordained weakness and grey hair. He creates whatever He wills. He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful"
  30,55,"On the Day the Last Hour arrives, the evildoers will swear they have not even tarried for an hour. That is the extent to which they are deceived"
  30,56,"Those who have been given knowledge and iman will say, ´You tarried in accordance with Allah´s Decree until the Day of Rising. And this is the Day of Rising, but you did not know it.´"
  30,57,On that Day the excuses of those who did wrong will not help them nor will they be able to appease Allah
  30,58,"We have made all kinds of examples for people in this Qur´an. If you bring them a Sign those who are kafir will say, ´You are just purveyors of falsehood!´"
  30,59,In that way Allah seals up the hearts of those who do not know
  30,60,So be steadfast. Allah´s promise is true. Do not let those who have no certainty belittle you
