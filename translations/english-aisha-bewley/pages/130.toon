quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Say: ´What thing is greatest as a witness?´ Say: ´Allah. He is Witness between me and you. This Qur´an has been revealed to me so that I may warn you by it, and anyone else it reaches. Do you then bear witness that there are other gods together with Allah?´ Say: ´I do not bear witness.´ Say: ´He is only One God, and I am free of all you associate with Him.´"
  6,20,"Those We have given the Book recognise it as they recognise their own children. As for those who have lost their own selves, they have no iman"
  6,21,Who could do greater wrong than someone who invents lies against Allah or denies His Signs? The wrongdoers are certainly not successful
  6,22,"On the Day We gather them all together, We will say to those who associated others with Allah, ´Where are the partner-gods, for whom you made such claims?´"
  6,23,"Then they will have no recourse except to say, ´By Allah, our Lord, we were not idolaters.´"
  6,24,See how they lie against themselves and how what they invented has forsaken them
  6,25,"Some of them listen to you but We have placed covers on their hearts, preventing them from understanding it, and heaviness in their ears. Though they see every Sign, they still have no iman, so that when they come to you, disputing with you, those who are kafir say, ´This is nothing but the myths of previous peoples!´"
  6,26,They keep others from it and avoid it themselves. They are only destroying themselves but they are not aware of it
  6,27,"If only you could see when they are standing before the Fire and saying, ´Oh! If only we could be sent back again, we would not deny the Signs of our Lord and we would be among the muminun.´"
