quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,89,"He said, ´Your request is answered, so go straight and do not follow the way of those who have no knowledge.´"
  10,90,"We brought the tribe of Israel across the sea and Pharaoh and his troops pursued them out of tyranny and enmity. Then, when he was on the point of drowning, he said, ´I believe that there is no god but Him in whom the tribe of Israel believe. I am one of the Muslims.´"
  10,91,"´What, now! When previously you rebelled and were one of the corrupters"
  10,92,Today We will preserve your body so you can be a Sign for people who come after you. Surely many people are heedless of Our Signs.´
  10,93,We settled the tribe of Israel in a noble place and gave them good things as provision. They did not differ until knowledge came to them. Your Lord will decide between them on the Day of Rising regarding the things about which they differed
  10,94,"If you are in any doubt about what We have sent down to you, then ask those who were reciting the Book before you. The truth has come to you from your Lord, so on no account be one of the doubters"
  10,95,And on no account be among those who deny Allah´s Signs and so become one of the lost
  10,96,Those against whom the words of your Lord are justly carried out will never have iman —
  10,97,not even if every Sign were to come to them — until they see the painful punishment
