quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  70,40,No! I swear by the Lord of the Easts and Wests that We have the power
  70,41,to replace them with something better than them. We will not be outstripped
  70,42,So leave them to plunge and play around until they meet their Day which they are promised
  70,43,The Day they will emerge swiftly from their graves as if rushing to rally to the flag
  70,44,"eyes downcast, darkened by debasement, that will be the Day which they were promised"
  71,1,"We sent Nuh to his people: ´Warn your people before a painful punishment comes to them.´"
  71,2,"He said, ´My people, I am a clear warner to you"
  71,3,"Worship Allah, have taqwa of Him and obey me"
  71,4,"He will forgive you your wrong actions and defer you until a specified time. When Allah´s time comes it cannot be deferred, if you only knew.´"
  71,5,"He said, ´My Lord, I have called my people night and day"
  71,6,but my calling has only made them more evasive
  71,7,"Indeed, every time I called them to Your forgiveness, they put their fingers in their ears, wrapped themselves up in their clothes and were overweeningly arrogant"
  71,8,Then I called them openly
  71,9,Then I addressed them publicly and addressed them privately
  71,10,"I said, \"Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Truly He is Endlessly Forgiving"
