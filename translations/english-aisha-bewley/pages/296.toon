  18,21,"Accordingly We made them chance upon them unexpectedly so they might know that Allah´s promise is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour. When they were arguing among themselves about the matter, they said, ´Wall up their cave, their Lord knows best about them.´ But those who got the better of the argument concerning them said, ´We will build a place of worship over them.´"
  18,22,"They will say, ´There were three of them, their dog being the fourth.´ They will say, ´There were five of them, their dog being the sixth,´ guessing at the Unseen. And they will say, ´There were seven of them, their dog being the eighth.´ Say: ´My Lord knows best their number. Those who know about them are very few.´ So do not enter into any argument concerning them, except in relation to what is clearly known. And do not seek the opinion of any of them regarding them"
  18,23,"Never say about anything, ´I will do that tomorrow,´"
  18,24,"Without adding ´If Allah wills.´ Remember your Lord when you forget, and say, ´Hopefully my Lord will guide me to something closer to right guidance than this.´"
  18,25,They stayed in their Cave for three hundred years and added nine
  18,26,"Say: ´Allah knows best how long they stayed. The Unseen of the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. How perfectly He sees, how well He hears! They have no protector apart from Him. Nor does He share His rule with anyone.´"
  18,27,Recite what has been revealed to you of your Lord´s Book. No one can change His Words. You will never find any safe haven apart from Him
