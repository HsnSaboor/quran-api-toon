quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  42,45,"You will see them as they are exposed to it, abject in their abasement, glancing around them furtively. Those who have iman will say, ´Truly the losers are those who lose themselves and their families on the Day of Rising.´ The wrongdoers are in an everlasting punishment"
  42,46,They have no one to protect or help them apart from Allah. There is no way out for anyone Allah misguides
  42,47,Respond to your Lord before a Day comes from Allah which cannot be turned back. On that Day you will have no hiding-place and no means of denial
  42,48,"But if they turn away, We have not sent you to be their guardian. You are only responsible for transmission. When We let a man taste mercy from Us he exults in it. But if something bad strikes him for what he has done he is ungrateful"
  42,49,The kingdom of the heavens and earth belongs to Allah. He creates whatever He wills. He gives daughters to whoever He wishes; and He gives sons to whoever He wishes
  42,50,"or He gives them both sons and daughters; and He makes whoever He wishes barren. Truly He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful"
  42,51,"It does not befit Allah to address any human being except by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or He sends a messenger who then reveals by His permission whatever He wills. He is indeed Most High, All-Wise"
