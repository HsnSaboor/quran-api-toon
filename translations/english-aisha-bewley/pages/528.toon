quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,that He created the two sexes — male and female —
  53,46,out of a sperm-drop when it spurted forth
  53,47,that He is responsible for the second existence
  53,48,that it is He Who enriches and Who satisfies
  53,49,that it is He Who is the Lord of Sirius
  53,50,"that He destroyed ´Ad, the earlier people"
  53,51,"and Thamud as well, sparing none of them"
  53,52,and the people of Nuh before — they were most unjust and exorbitant —
  53,53,and the Overturned City which He turned upside down
  53,54,so that what enveloped it enveloped it
  53,55,Which one of your Lord´s blessings do you then dispute
  53,56,This is a warning like the warnings of old
  53,57,The Imminent is imminent
  53,58,No one besides Allah can unveil it
  53,59,Are you then amazed at this discourse
  53,60,and laugh and do not cry
  53,61,treating life as a game
  53,62,Prostrate before Allah and worship Him
  54,1,The Hour has drawn near and the moon has split
  54,2,"If they see a Sign they turn away, saying ´There is no end to this witchcraft!´"
  54,3,"They have denied the truth and followed their whims and desires, but everything has its time"
  54,4,News has come to them which contains a threat
  54,5,consummate wisdom — but warnings are profitless
  54,6,Turn away from them then. On the Day the Summoner summons them to something unspeakably terrible
