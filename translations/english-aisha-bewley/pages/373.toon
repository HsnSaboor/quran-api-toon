quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,137,This is only what the previous peoples did
  26,138,We are not going to be punished.´
  26,139,"So they denied him and We destroyed them. There is certainly a Sign in that, yet most of them are not muminun"
  26,140,"Truly your Lord is the Almighty, the Most Merciful"
  26,141,Thamud denied the Messengers
  26,142,"when their brother Salih said to them, ´Will you not have taqwa"
  26,143,I am a faithful Messenger to you
  26,144,so have taqwa of Allah and obey me
  26,145,I do not ask you for any wage for it. My wage is the responsibility of no one but the Lord of all the worlds
  26,146,Are you going to be left secure amid what is here
  26,147,amid gardens and clear springs
  26,148,and cultivated fields and palms with supple spathes
  26,149,Will you continue hewing houses from the mountains with exultant skill
  26,150,So have taqwa of Allah and obey me
  26,151,Do not obey the orders of the profligate
  26,152,those who corrupt the earth and do not put things right.´
  26,153,"They said, ´You are merely someone bewitched"
  26,154,"You are nothing but a human being like ourselves, so produce a Sign if you are telling the truth.´"

  26,156,Do not do anything to harm her or the punishment of a terrible day will come down on you.´
  26,157,But they hamstrung her and woke up full of remorse
  26,158,"for the punishment did come down them. There is certainly a Sign in that, yet most of them are not muminun"
  26,159,"Truly your Lord is the Almighty, the Most Merciful"
