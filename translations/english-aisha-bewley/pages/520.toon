quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,How many generations before them We destroyed who had greater force than them and scoured many lands! Did they find any way of escape
  50,37,"There is a reminder in that for anyone who has a heart, or who listens well, having seen the evidence"
  50,38,"We created the heavens and the earth, and everything between them, in six days and We were not affected by fatigue"
  50,39,So be patient in the face of what they say and glorify your Lord with praise before the rising of the sun and before it sets
  50,40,And glorify Him during the night and after you have prostrated
  50,41,Listen out for the Day when the Summoner shall call out from a nearby place
  50,42,"The Day they hear the Blast in truth, that is the Day of Emergence"
  50,43,It is We who give life and cause to die and We are their final destination
  50,44,"The Day the earth splits open all around them as they come rushing forth, that is a gathering, easy for Us to accomplish"
  50,45,"We know best what they say. You are not a dictator over them. So remind, with the Qur´an, whoever fears My Threat"
  51,1,By the scatterers scattering
  51,2,and those bearing weighty loads
  51,3,and those speeding along with ease
  51,4,and those apportioning the command
  51,5,what you are promised is certainly true —
  51,6,the Judgement will certainly take place
