quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,135,"They say, ´Be Jews or Christians and you will be guided.´ Say, ´Rather adopt the religion of Ibrahim, a man of natural pure belief. He was not one of the idolaters.´"
  2,136,"Say, ´We have iman in Allah and what has been sent down to us and what was sent down to Ibrahim and Isma´il and Ishaq and Ya´qub and the Tribes, and what Musa and ´Isa were given, and what all the Prophets were given by their Lord. We do not differentiate between any of them. We are Muslims submitted to Him.´"
  2,137,"If their iman is the same as yours then they are guided. But if they turn away, they are entrenched in hostility. Allah will be enough for you against them. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing"
  2,138,The colouring of Allah — and what colouring could be better than Allah´s? It is Him we worship
  2,139,"Say, ´Do you argue with us about Allah when He is our Lord and your Lord? We have our actions and you have your actions. We act for Him alone.´"
  2,140,"Or do they say that Ibrahim and Isma´il and Ishaq and Ya´qub and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say, ´Do you know better or does Allah?´ Who could do greater wrong than someone who hides the evidence he has been given by Allah? Allah is not unaware of what you do"
  2,141,That was a community which has long since passed away. It has what it earned. You have what you have earned. You will not be questioned about what they did
