quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,123,You who have iman! fight those of the kuffar who are near to you and let them find you implacable. Know that Allah is with those who have taqwa
  9,124,"Each time a sura is sent down there are some among them who say, ´Which of you has this increased in iman?´ As for those who have iman, it increases them in iman and they rejoice at it"
  9,125,"But as for those with sickness in their hearts, it adds defilement to their defilement, and they die kuffar"
  9,126,Do they not see that they are tried once or twice in every year? But still they do not turn back. They do not pay heed
  9,127,"Each time a sura is sent down, they look at one another, implying, ´Can anyone see you?´ Then they turn away. Allah has turned their hearts away because they are people who do not understand"
  9,128,A Messenger has come to you from among yourselves. Your suffering is distressing to him; he is deeply concerned for you; he is gentle and merciful to the muminun
  9,129,"But if they turn away, say, ´Allah is enough for me. There is no god but Him. I have put my trust in Him. He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.´"
