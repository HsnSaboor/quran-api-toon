quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  22,73,"Mankind! an example has been made, so listen to it carefully. Those whom you call upon besides Allah are not even able to create a single fly, even if they were to join together to do it. And if a fly steals something from them, they cannot get it back. How feeble are both the seeker and the sought"
  22,74,"They do not measure Allah with His true measure. Allah is All-Strong, Almighty"
  22,75,"Allah chooses Messengers from the angels and from mankind. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing"
  22,76,He knows what is before them and what is behind them. All matters return to Allah
  22,77,"You who have iman! bow and prostrate and worship your Lord, and do good, so that hopefully you will be successful"
  22,78,"Do jihad for Allah with the jihad due to Him. He has selected you and not placed any constraint upon you in the deen — the religion of your forefather Ibrahim. He named you Muslims before and also in this, so that the Messenger could be witness against you and you could be witnesses against all mankind. So establish salat and pay zakat and hold fast to Allah. He is your Protector — the Best Protector, the Best Helper"
