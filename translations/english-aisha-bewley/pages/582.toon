quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,About what are they asking one another
  78,2,About the momentous news
  78,3,the thing about which they differ
  78,4,No indeed! They will soon know
  78,5,"Again, no indeed! They will soon know"
  78,6,Have We not made the earth a flat carpet
  78,7,and the mountains its pegs
  78,8,We have created you in pairs
  78,9,We made your sleep a break
  78,10,We made the night a cloak
  78,11,We made the day for earning a living
  78,12,We built seven firm layers above you
  78,13,We installed a blazing lamp
  78,14,We sent down cascading water from the clouds
  78,15,so that by it We might bring forth grains and plants
  78,16,and luxuriant gardens
  78,17,The Day of Decision is a fixed appointment
  78,18,the Day the Trumpet is blown and you come in droves
  78,19,and heaven is opened and becomes doorways
  78,20,and the mountains are shifted and become a mirage
  78,21,Hell lies in wait —
  78,22,a homecoming for the profligate
  78,23,remaining in it for countless aeons
  78,24,not tasting any coolness there or any drink
  78,25,except for boiling water and scalding pus —
  78,26,a fitting recompense
  78,27,They did not expect to have a reckoning
  78,28,and utterly denied Our Signs
  78,29,We have recorded all things in writing
  78,30,So taste! We will increase you only in punishment
