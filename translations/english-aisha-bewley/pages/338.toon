quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  22,47,They ask you to hasten the punishment. Allah will not break His promise. A day with your Lord is equivalent to a thousand years in the way you count
  22,48,How many wrongdoing cities I allowed time to and then I seized them. I am their final destination
  22,49,"Say: ´Mankind, I am only a clear warner to you.´"
  22,50,"As for those who have iman and do right actions, they will have forgiveness and generous provision"
  22,51,"But as for those who strive against My Signs and try to thwart them, they will be the Companions of the Blazing Fire"
  22,52,"We did not send any Messenger or any Prophet before you without Shaytan insinuating something into his recitation while he was reciting. But Allah revokes whatever Shaytan insinuates and then Allah confirms His Signs — Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise —"
  22,53,so that He can make what Shaytan insinuates a trial for those with sickness in their hearts and for those whose hearts are hard — the wrongdoers are entrenched in hostility —
  22,54,and so that those who have been given knowledge will know it is the truth from their Lord and have iman in it and their hearts will be humbled to Him. Allah guides those who have iman to a straight path
  22,55,But those who are kafir will not cease to be in doubt of it until the Hour comes on them suddenly or the punishment of a desolate Day arrives
