quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,"There will circulate among them, ageless youths"
  56,18,carrying goblets and decanters and a cup from a flowing spring —
  56,19,it does not give them any headache nor does it leave them stupefied
  56,20,And any fruit they specify
  56,21,and any bird-meat they desire
  56,22,And dark-eyed maidens
  56,23,like hidden pearls
  56,24,As recompense for what they did
  56,25,They will hear no prattling in it nor any word of wrong
  56,26,"All that is said is, ´Peace! Peace!´"
  56,27,"And the Companions of the Right: what of the Companions of the Right"
  56,28,Amid thornless lote-trees
  56,29,and fruit-laden acacias
  56,30,and wide-spreading shade
  56,31,and outpouring water
  56,32,and fruits in abundance
  56,33,"never failing, unrestricted"
  56,34,And on elevated couches
  56,35,We have brought maidens into being
  56,36,and made them purest virgins
  56,37,"devoted, passionate, of like age"
  56,38,for the Companions of the Right
  56,39,A large group of the earlier people
  56,40,and a large group of the later ones
  56,41,"And the Companions of the Left: what of the Companions of the Left"
  56,42,Amid searing blasts and scalding water
  56,43,and the murk of thick black smoke
  56,44,providing no coolness and no pleasure
  56,45,Before that they were living in luxury
  56,46,persisting in immense wrongdoing
  56,47,"and saying, ´When we are dead and turned to dust and bones, shall we then be raised again"
  56,48,"or our forefathers, the earlier peoples?´"
  56,49,"Say: ´The earlier and the later peoples will certainly all be gathered"
  56,50,to the appointment of a specified Day
