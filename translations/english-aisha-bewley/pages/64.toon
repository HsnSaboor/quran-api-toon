quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,109,Everything in the heavens and everything in the earth belongs to Allah. All matters return to Allah
  3,110,"You are the best nation ever to be produced before mankind. You enjoin the right, forbid the wrong and have iman in Allah. If the People of the Book were to have iman, it would be better for them. Some of them are muminun but most of them are deviators"
  3,111,"They will not harm you except with abusive words. If they fight you, they will turn their backs on you. Then they will not be helped"
  3,112,"They will be plunged into abasement wherever they are found, unless they have a treaty with Allah and with the people. They have brought down anger from Allah upon themselves, and they have been plunged into destitution. That was because they rejected Allah´s Signs and killed the Prophets without any right to do so. That was because they disobeyed and went beyond the limits"
  3,113,"They are not all the same. There is a community among the People of the Book who are upright. They recite Allah´s Signs throughout the night, and they prostrate"
  3,114,"They have iman in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin the right and forbid the wrong, and compete in doing good. They are among the righteous"
  3,115,You will not be denied the reward for any good thing you do. Allah knows those who have taqwa
