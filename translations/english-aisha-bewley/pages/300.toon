quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  18,54,"We have variegated throughout this Qur´an all kinds of examples for people, but, more than anything else, man is argumentative"
  18,55,When guidance came to the people nothing prevented them from having iman and asking for forgiveness from their Lord but the fact that the pattern of previous peoples did not happen to them or that the punishment did not appear before their eyes
  18,56,We only send the Messengers to bring good news and to give warning. Those who are kafir use fallacious arguments to deny the truth. They make a mockery of My Signs and also of the warning they were given
  18,57,"Who could do greater wrong than someone who is reminded of the Signs of his Lord and then turns away from them, forgetting all that he has done before? We have placed covers on their hearts, preventing them from understanding it, and heaviness in their ears. Though you call them to guidance, they will nonetheless never be guided"
  18,58,"Your Lord is the Ever-Forgiving, the Possessor of Mercy. If He had taken them to task for what they have earned, He would have hastened their punishment. Instead, they have a promised appointment and they will not find any refuge from it"
  18,59,"Those cities: We destroyed them when they did wrong and fixed a promised time for their destruction"
  18,60,"Remember when Musa said to his servant, ´I will not give up until I reach the meeting-place of the two seas, even if I must press on for many years.´"
  18,61,"But when they reached their meeting-place, they forgot their fish which quickly burrowed its way into the sea"
