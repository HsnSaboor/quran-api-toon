quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  47,12,"Allah will admit those who have iman to Gardens with rivers flowing under them. Those who are kafir have their enjoyment, eating as cattle eat, but the Fire will be their final residence"
  47,13,"How many cities We have destroyed, greater in strength than your city which has driven you out, and there was no one to help them"
  47,14,Is someone on a clear path from his Lord like those whose bad actions have been made to seem good to them and who follow their own desires
  47,15,"An image of the Garden which is promised to those who have taqwa: in it there are rivers of water which will never spoil and rivers of milk whose taste will never change and rivers of wine, delightful to all who drink it, and rivers of honey of undiluted purity; in it they will have fruit of every kind and forgiveness from their Lord. Is that like those who will be in the Fire timelessly, for ever, with boiling water to drink which lacerates their bowels"
  47,16,"Among them are those who listen to you and then, when they leave your presence, say to those who have been given knowledge, ´What was that he just said?´ They are those whose hearts Allah has sealed up and who follow their own desires"
  47,17,He increases in guidance those who are already guided and gives them their taqwa
  47,18,What are they awaiting but for the Hour to come upon them suddenly? Its Signs have already come. What good will their Reminder be to them when it does arrive
  47,19,"Know then that there is no god except Allah and ask forgiveness for your wrongdoing, and for the men and women who have iman. Allah knows both your activity and your repose"
