quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,265,"The metaphor of those who spend their wealth, desiring the pleasure of Allah and firmness for themselves, is that of a garden on a hillside. When heavy rain falls on it, it doubles its produce; and if heavy rain does not fall, there is dew. Allah sees what you do"
  2,266,"Would any of you like to have a garden of dates and grapes, with rivers flowing underneath and containing all kinds of fruits, then to be stricken with old age and have children who are weak, and then for a fierce whirlwind containing fire to come and strike it so that it goes up in flames? In this way Allah makes His Signs clear to you, so that hopefully you will reflect"
  2,267,"You who have iman! give away some of the good things you have earned and some of what We have produved for you from the earth. Do not have recourse to bad things when you give, things you would only take with your eyes tight shut! Know that Allah is Rich Beyond Need, Praiseworthy"
  2,268,"Shaytan promises you poverty and commands you to self-gratification. Allah promises you forgiveness from Him and abundance. Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing"
  2,269,He gives wisdom to whoever He wills and he who has been given wisdom has been given great good. But no one pays heed but people of intelligence
