quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,225,"Allah will not take you to task for inadvertent statements in your oaths, but He will take you to task for the intention your hearts have made. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, All-Forbearing"
  2,226,"Those who swear to abstain from sexual relations with their wives can wait for a period of up to four months. If they then retract their oath, Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"

It is not lawful for you to keep anything you have given them unless a couple fear that they will not remain within Allah´s limits.

  2,230,"But if a man divorces his wife a third time, she is not halal for him after that until she has married another husband.
