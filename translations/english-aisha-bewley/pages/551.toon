quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  60,12,"O Prophet! When women who have iman come to you pledging allegiance to you on the grounds that they will not associate anything with Allah or steal or fornicate or kill their children or give a false ascription of paternity — making up lies about their bodies — or disobey you in respect of anything right, then accept their pledge and ask forgiveness for them. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  60,13,"You who have iman! do not make friends of people with whom Allah is angry, who have despaired of the Next World as the kafirun have despaired of the inhabitants of the graves"
  61,1,"Everything in the heavens and everything in the earth glorifies Allah. He is the Almighty, the All-Wise"
  61,2,You who have iman! why do you say what you do not do
  61,3,It is deeply abhorrent to Allah that you should say what you do not do
  61,4,Allah loves those who fight in His Way in ranks like well-built walls
  61,5,"Remember when Musa said to his people, ´My people, why do you mistreat me when you know that I am the Messenger of Allah to you?´ So when they deviated, Allah made their hearts deviate. Allah does not guide people who are deviators"
