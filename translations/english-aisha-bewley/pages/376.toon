quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,that what they enjoyed will be of any use to them
  26,208,We have never destroyed a city without giving it prior warning
  26,209,as a reminder. We were never unjust
  26,210,The shaytans did not bring it down
  26,211,It does not befit them and they are not capable of it
  26,212,They are debarred from hearing it
  26,213,So do not call on any other god along with Allah or you will be among those who will be punished
  26,214,Warn your near relatives
  26,215,and take the muminun who follow you under your wing
  26,216,"If they disobey you, say, ´I am free of what you do.´"
  26,217,"Put your trust in the Almighty, the Most Merciful"
  26,218,He who sees you when you stand up to pray
  26,219,and your movements with those who prostrate
  26,220,"He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing"
  26,221,Shall I tell you upon whom the shaytans descend
  26,222,They descend on every evil liar
  26,223,They give them a hearing and most of them are liars
  26,224,"And as for poets, it is the misled who follow them"
  26,225,Do you not see how they ramble on in every style
  26,226,and say things which they do not do
  26,227,except those who have iman and do right actions and remember Allah repeatedly and defend themselves after they have been wronged? Those who do wrong will soon know the kind of reversal they will receive
