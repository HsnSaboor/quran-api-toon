quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,41,My people! how is it that I call you to salvation while you call me to the Fire
  40,42,"You call me to reject Allah and to associate something with Him about which I have no knowledge, while I call you to the Almighty, the Endlessly Forgiving"
  40,43,"There is no question that what you call me to has no foundation either in this world or the Next World, that our return is to Allah, and that the profligate will be Companions of the Fire"
  40,44,You will remember what I say to you. I consign my affair completely to Allah. Truly Allah sees His slaves.´
  40,45,So Allah safeguarded him from the evil things they plotted and a most evil torment engulfed Pharaoh´s people —
  40,46,"the Fire, morning and night, to which they are exposed; and on the Day the Hour takes place: ´Admit Pharaoh´s people to the harshest punishment!´"
  40,47,"When they are squabbling with one another in the Fire, the weak will say to those deemed great, ´We were your followers, so why do you not relieve us of a portion of the Fire?´"
  40,48,"Those deemed great will say, ´All of us are in it. Allah has clearly judged between His slaves.´"
  40,49,"Those in the Fire will say to the custodians of Hell, ´Call on your Lord to make the punishment less for us for just one day.´"
