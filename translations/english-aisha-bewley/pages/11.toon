quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,70,"They said, ´Ask your Lord to make it clear to us what it should be like. Cows are all much the same to us. Then, if Allah wills, we will be guided.´"
  2,71,"He said, ´He says it should be a cow not trained to plough or irrigate the fields — completely sound, without a blemish on it.´ They said, ´Now you have brought the truth.´ So they sacrificed it — but they almost did not do it"
  2,72,"Remember when you killed someone and violently accused each other of it, and Allah brought out what you were hiding"
  2,73,"We said, ´Hit him with part of it!´ In that way Allah gives life to the dead and He shows you His Signs so that hopefully you will understand"
  2,74,"Then your hearts became hardened after that, so they were like rocks or even harder still. There are some rocks from which rivers gush out, and others which split open and water pours out, and others which crash down from fear of Allah. Allah is not unaware of what you do"
  2,75,"Do you really hope they will follow you in iman when a group of them heard Allah´s Word and then, after grasping it, knowingly distorted it"
  2,76,"When they meet those who have iman, they say, ´We have iman.´ But when they go apart with one another, they say, ´Why do you speak to them about what Allah has disclosed to you, so they can use it as an argument against you before your Lord? Will you not use your intellect?´"
