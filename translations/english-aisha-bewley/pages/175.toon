quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"Say: ´I possess no power to help or harm myself, except as Allah wills. If I had had knowledge of the Unseen, I would have sought to gain much good and no evil would have touched me. I am only a warner and a bringer of good news to people who have iman.´"
  7,189,"It is He who created you from a single self and made from him his spouse so that he might find repose in her. Then when he covered her she bore a light load and carried it around. Then when it became heavy they called on Allah, their Lord, ´If You grant us a healthy child, we will be among the thankful!´"
  7,190,"Then when He granted them a healthy, upright child, they associated what He had given them with Him. But Allah is far above what they associate with Him"
  7,191,Do they make things into partner-gods which cannot create anything and are themselves created
  7,192,which are not capable of helping them and cannot even help themselves
  7,193,If you call them to guidance they will not follow you. It makes no difference if you call them or stay silent
  7,194,Those you call on besides Allah are slaves just like yourselves. Call on them and let them respond to you if you are telling the truth
  7,195,"Do they have legs they can walk with? Do they have hands they can grasp with? Do they have eyes they can see with? Do they have ears they can hear with? Say: ´Call on your partner-gods and try all your wiles against me and grant me no reprieve"
