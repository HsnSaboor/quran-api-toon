quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  14,25,It bears fruit regularly by its Lord´s permission. Allah makes metaphors for people so that hopefully they will pay heed
  14,26,"The metaphor of a corrupt word is that of a rotten tree, uprooted on the surface of the earth. It has no staying-power"
  14,27,Allah makes those who have iman firm with the Firm Word in the life of this world and the Next World. But Allah misguides the wrongdoers. Allah does whatever He wills

  14,29,"Hell, where they will roast? What an evil place to stay"
  14,30,"They have made others equal to Allah to misguide people from His Way. Say: ´Enjoy yourselves! Your destination is the Fire!´"
  14,31,"Tell My slaves who have iman that they should establish salat and give from what We have provided for them, secretly and openly, before a Day arrives on which there will be no trading and no friendship"
  14,32,"Allah is He who created the heavens and the earth and sends down water from the sky and by it brings forth fruits as provision for you. He has made the ships subservient to you to run upon the sea by His command, and He has made the rivers subservient to you"
  14,33,"and He has made the sun and moon subservient to you holding steady to their courses, and He has made the night and day subservient to you"
