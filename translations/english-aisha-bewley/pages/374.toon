quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  26,160,The people of Lut denied the Messengers
  26,161,"when their brother Lut said to them, ´Will you not have taqwa"
  26,162,I am a faithful Messenger to you
  26,163,so have taqwa of Allah and obey me
  26,164,I do not ask you for any wage for it. My wage is the responsibility of no one but the Lord of all the worlds
  26,165,"Of all beings, do you lie with males"
  26,166,leaving the wives Allah has created for you? You are a people who have overstepped the limits.´
  26,167,"They said, ´Lut, if you do not desist you will be expelled.´"
  26,168,"He said, ´I am someone who detests the deed you perpetrate"
  26,169,"My Lord, rescue me and my family from what they are doing.´"
  26,170,Therefore We rescued him and all his family —
  26,171,except for an old woman who remained behind
  26,172,Then We utterly destroyed the rest
  26,173,and made a Rain come pouring down upon them. How evil is the rain of those who are warned
  26,174,"There is certainly a Sign in that, yet most of them are not muminun"
  26,175,"Truly your Lord is the Almighty, the Most Merciful"
  26,176,The Companions of the Thicket denied the Messengers
  26,177,"when Shu´ayb said to them, ´Will you not have taqwa"
  26,178,I am a faithful Messenger to you
  26,179,so have taqwa of Allah and obey me
  26,180,I do not ask you for any wage for it. My wage is the responsibility of no one but the Lord of all the worlds
  26,181,Give full measure. Do not skimp
  26,182,Weigh with a level balance
  26,183,"Do not diminish people´s goods and do not go about the earth, corrupting it"
