quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,6,There is no creature on the earth which is not dependent upon Allah for its provision. He knows where it lives and where it dies. They are all in a Clear Book
  11,7,"It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days when His Throne was on the water, in order to test which of you has the best actions. If you say, ´You will be raised up after death,´ those who are kafir will say, ´This is nothing but downright magic.´"
  11,8,"If We postpone the punishment for them for a limited time, they will say, ´What is holding it back?´ No, indeed! The day it reaches them it will not be averted from them and the things they mocked at will encompass them"
  11,9,"If We let man taste mercy from Us, and then take it away from him, he is despairing, ungrateful"
  11,10,"but if We let him taste blessings after hardship has afflicted him, he says, ´My troubles have gone away,´ and he is overjoyed, boastful —"
  11,11,except for those who are steadfast and do right actions. They will receive forgiveness and a large reward
  11,12,"Perhaps you are leaving aside part of what has been revealed to you and your breast is constricted by this because they say, ´Why has treasure not been sent down to him or an angel not accompanied him?´ You are only a warner and Allah is Guardian over all things"
