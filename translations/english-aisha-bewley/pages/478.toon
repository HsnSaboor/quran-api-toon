quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  41,12,"In two days He determined them as seven heavens and revealed, in every heaven, its own mandate. We adorned the lowest heaven with lamps and guarded it. That is the decree of the Almighty, the All-Knowing"
  41,13,"If they turn away, then say, ´I warn you of a lightning-bolt like the lightning-bolt of ´Ad and of Thamud.´"
  41,14,"When the Messengers came to them from in front and from behind, saying, ´Do not worship anyone but Allah.´ they said, ´If our Lord had willed, He could have sent angels down, so we reject the Message you have been sent with.´"
  41,15,"´Ad were arrogant in the land, without any right, saying, ´Who has greater strength than us?´ Did they not see that Allah, who created them, had greater strength than them? But they renounced Our Signs"
  41,16,So We sent a howling wind against them on disastrous ill-fated days to make them taste the punishment of degradation in this world. And the punishment of the Next World is even more degrading. And they will not be helped
  41,17,"As for Thamud, We guided them, but they preferred blindness to guidance. So the lightning-bolt of the punishment of humiliation seized them on account of what they earned"

  41,19,On the Day We crowd the enemies of Allah into the Fire and they are driven in close-packed ranks
