quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,25,´Why are you not helping one another?´
  37,26,"No, today they come in absolute submission"
  37,27,"They will confront each other, questioning one another"
  37,28,"One group will say, ´You used to come at us from a position of power.´"
  37,29,"The others will say, ´The truth is that you were not muminun"
  37,30,We had no authority over you. Rather you were unbridled people
  37,31,"Our Lord´s Word has been carried out against us, that we would taste it"
  37,32,We misled you and we were ourselves misled.´
  37,33,On that Day they will be partners in the punishment
  37,34,That is how We deal with evildoers
  37,35,"When they were told, ´There is no god but Allah,´ they were arrogant"
  37,36,"They said, ´Are we to forsake our gods for a mad poet?´"
  37,37,Rather he has brought the truth and confirmed the Messengers
  37,38,You will definitely taste the painful punishment
  37,39,and you will only be repaid for what you did —
  37,40,except for Allah´s chosen slaves
  37,41,They will have preordained provision
  37,42,sweet fruits and high honour
  37,43,in Gardens of Delight
  37,44,on couches face to face
  37,45,a cup from a flowing spring passing round among them
  37,46,"as white as driven snow, delicious to those who drink"
  37,47,which has no headache in it and does not leave them stupefied
  37,48,"There will be dark-eyed maidens with them, with eyes reserved for them alone"
  37,49,just like closely guarded pearls
  37,50,"They will confront each other, questioning one another"
  37,51,"One of them will say, ´I used to have a friend"
