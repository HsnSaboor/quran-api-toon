quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,28,"But if you do turn away from them, seeking the mercy you hope for from your Lord, then speak to them with words that bring them ease"
  17,29,Do not keep your hand chained to your neck but do not extend it either to its full extent so that you sit there blamed and destitute
  17,30,Your Lord expands the provision of anyone He wills and restricts it. He is aware of and sees His slaves
  17,31,Do not kill your children out of fear of being poor. We will provide for them and you. Killing them is a terrible mistake
  17,32,"And do not go near to fornication. It is an indecent act, an evil way"
  17,33,"Do not kill any person Allah has made inviolate, except with the right to do so. If someone is wrongly killed We have given authority to his next of kin. But he should not be excessive in taking life. He will be helped"
  17,34,"Do not go near the property of orphans before they reach maturity, except in a good way. Fulfil your contracts. Contracts will be asked about"
  17,35,Give full measure when you measure and weigh with a level balance. That is better and gives the best result
  17,36,"Do not pursue what you have no knowledge of. Hearing, sight and hearts will all be questioned"
  17,37,Do not strut arrogantly about the earth. You will certainly never split the earth apart nor will you ever rival the mountains in height
  17,38,All of that is evil action and hateful in the sight of your Lord
