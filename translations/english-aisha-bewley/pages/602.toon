quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,In acknowledgment of the established tradition of Quraysh
  106,2,their tradition of the winter and summer caravans
  106,3,so let them worship the Lord of this House
  106,4,who has preserved them from hunger and secured them from fear
  107,1,Have you seen him who denies the deen
  107,2,He is the one who harshly rebuffs the orphan
  107,3,and does not urge the feeding of the poor
  107,4,So woe to those who do salat
  107,5,and are forgetful of their salat
  107,6,those who show off
  107,7,and deny help to others
  108,1,Truly We have given you the Great Abundance
  108,2,So pray to your Lord and sacrifice
  108,3,It is the one who hates you who is cut off without an heir
