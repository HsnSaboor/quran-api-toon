quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,103,"We know that they say, ´It is only a human being who is teaching him.´ The language of him they allude to is a foreign one whereas this is in clear and lucid Arabic"
  16,104,"As for those who do not have iman in Allah´s Signs, Allah will not guide them and they will have a painful punishment"
  16,105,Those who do not have iman in Allah´s Signs are merely inventing lies. It is they who are the liars
  16,106,"Those who reject Allah after having had iman — except for someone forced to do it whose heart remains at rest in its iman — but as for those whose breasts become dilated with kufr, anger from Allah will come down on them. They will have a terrible punishment"
  16,107,That is because they prefer the life of this world to the Next World and because Allah does not guide kafir people
  16,108,"Those are the people whose hearts, hearing and sight Allah has sealed up. They are the unaware"
  16,109,There is no doubt that in the akhira they will be the losers
  16,110,"But to those who made hijra after they were persecuted and then did jihad and remained steadfast, to them your Lord is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
