quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,103,Then when they had both submitted and he had lain him face down on the ground
  37,104,"We called out to him, ´Ibrahim"
  37,105,you have discharged your vision.´ That is how We recompense good-doers
  37,106,This was indeed a most manifest trial
  37,107,We ransomed him with a mighty sacrifice
  37,108,and left the later people saying of him
  37,109,´Peace be upon Ibrahim.´
  37,110,That is how We recompense good-doers
  37,111,He truly was one of Our mumin slaves
  37,112,"We gave him the good news of Ishaq, a Prophet, one of the righteous"
  37,113,We showered blessings upon him and upon Ishaq. Among their descendants are good-doers and also people who clearly wrong themselves
  37,114,We showed great kindness to Musa and Harun
  37,115,We rescued them and their people from their terrible plight
  37,116,We supported them and so they were the victors
  37,117,We gave them the clarifying Book
  37,118,and guided them on the Straight Path
  37,119,and left the later people saying of them
  37,120,´Peace be upon Musa and Harun!´
  37,121,That is how We recompense good-doers
  37,122,They truly were among Our slaves who are muminun
  37,123,Ilyas was one of the Messengers
  37,124,"When he said to his people, ´Will you not have taqwa"
  37,125,Do you call on Baal and abandon the Best of Creators
  37,126,"Allah is your Lord and Lord of your forefathers, the previous peoples,´"
