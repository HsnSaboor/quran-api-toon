quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  50,1,Qaf By the Glorious Qur´an
  50,2,"Nonetheless they are amazed that a warner should have come to them from among themselves and those who are kafir say, ´What an extraordinary thing"
  50,3,When we are dead and turned to dust . . . ? That would be a most unlikely return!´
  50,4,We know exactly how the earth eats them away. We possess an all-preserving Book
  50,5,"But they denied the truth when it came to them. They are, therefore, in a very muddled state"
  50,6,"Have they not looked at the sky above them: how We structured it and made it beautiful and how there are no fissures in it"
  50,7,"And the earth: how We stretched it out and cast firmly embedded mountains onto it and caused luxuriant plants of every kind to grow in it"
  50,8,an instruction and a reminder for every penitent human being
  50,9,And We sent down blessed water from the sky and made gardens grow by it and grain for harvesting
  50,10,and soaring date-palms with layered spathes
  50,11,as provision for Our slaves; by it We brought a dead land to life. That is how the Emergence will take place
  50,12,Before them the people of Nuh also denied the truth and the Companions of Rass and Thamud
  50,13,and ´Ad and Pharaoh and the brothers of Lut
  50,14,and the Companions of the Thicket and the people of Tubba´. Each one denied the Messengers and My promise proved true
  50,15,Were We exhausted by the first creation? Yet they are dubious about the new creation
