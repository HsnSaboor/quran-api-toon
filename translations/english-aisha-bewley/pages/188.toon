quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,7,"How could any of the idolaters possibly have a treaty with Allah and with His Messenger, except for those you made a treaty with at the Masjid al-Haram? As long as they are straight with you, be straight with them. Allah loves those who have taqwa"
  9,8,"How indeed! For if they get the upper hand over you, they will respect neither kinship nor treaty. They please you with their mouths but their hearts belie their words. Most of them are deviators"
  9,9,"They have sold Allah´s Signs for a paltry price, and they have barred access to His Way. What they have done is truly evil"
  9,10,They respect neither kinship nor treaty where a mumin is concerned. They are the people who overstep the limits
  9,11,"But if they make tawba and establish salat and pay zakat, they are your brothers in the deen. We make the Signs clear for people who have knowledge"
  9,12,"If they break their oaths after making their treaty and defame your deen, then fight the leaders of kufr — their oaths mean nothing — so that hopefully they will stop"
  9,13,"Will you not fight a people who have broken their oaths and resolved to expel the Messenger, and who initiated hostilities against you in the first place? Is it them you fear? Allah has more right to your fear if you are muminun"
