quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,7,"They carry your loads to lands you would never reach except with great difficulty. Your Lord is All-Gentle, Most Merciful"
  16,8,"And horses, mules and donkeys both to ride and for adornment. And He creates other things you do not know"
  16,9,"The Way should lead to Allah, but there are those who deviate from it. If He had wished He could have guided every one of you"
  16,10,It is He who sends down water from the sky. From it you drink and from it come the shrubs among which you graze your herds
  16,11,And by it He makes crops grow for you and olives and dates and grapes and fruit of every kind. There is certainly a Sign in that for people who reflect
  16,12,"He has made night and day subservient to you, and the sun and moon and stars, all subject to His command. There are certainly Signs in that for people who use their intellect"
  16,13,And also the things of varying colours He has created for you in the earth. There is certainly a Sign in that for people who pay heed
  16,14,"It is He who made the sea subservient to you so that you can eat fresh flesh from it and bring out from it ornaments to wear. And you see the ships cleaving through it so that you can seek His bounty, and so that hopefully you will show thanks"
