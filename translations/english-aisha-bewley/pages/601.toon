quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By the Late Afternoon
  103,2,truly man is in loss —
  103,3,except for those who have iman and do right actions and urge each other to the truth and urge each other to steadfastness
  104,1,Woe to every faultfinding backbiter
  104,2,who has amassed wealth and hoarded it
  104,3,He thinks his wealth will make him live for ever
  104,4,No indeed! He will be flung into the Shatterer
  104,5,And what will convey to you what the Shatterer is
  104,6,The kindled Fire of Allah
  104,7,reaching right into the heart
  104,8,It is sealed in above them
  104,9,in towering columns
  105,1,Do you not see what your Lord did with the Companions of the Elephant
  105,2,Did He not bring all their schemes to nothing
  105,3,unleashing upon them flock after flock of birds
  105,4,bombarding them with stones of hard-baked clay
  105,5,making them like stripped wheat-stalks eaten bare
