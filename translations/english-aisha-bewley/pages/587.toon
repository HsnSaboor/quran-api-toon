  82,1,When the sky is split apart
  82,2,when the stars are strewn about
  82,3,when the seas flood and overflow
  82,4,when the graves are emptied out
  82,5,each self will know what it has sent ahead and left behind
  82,6,O man! what has deluded you in respect of your Noble Lord
  82,7,He Who created you and formed you and proportioned you
  82,8,and assembled you in whatever way He willed

  82,15,They will roast in it on the Day of Judgment
  82,16,and will never get away from it
  82,17,What will convey to you what the Day of Judgement is
