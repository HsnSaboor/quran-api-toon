quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,No indeed! But you love this fleeting world
  75,21,and you disregard the Next World
  75,22,Faces that Day will be radiant
  75,23,gazing at their Lord
  75,24,And faces that Day will be glowering
  75,25,realising that a back-breaking blow has fallen
  75,26,No indeed! When it reaches the gullet
  75,27,"and he hears the words, ´Who can heal him now?´"
  75,28,and he knows it is indeed the final parting
  75,29,and one leg is entwined with the other
  75,30,that Day he will be driven to your Lord
  75,31,He neither affirmed the truth nor did he do salat
  75,32,but rather denied the truth and turned away
  75,33,"and then went off to his family, swaggering"
  75,34,It is coming closer to you and closer
  75,35,Then closer to you and closer still
  75,36,Does man reckon he will be left to go on unchecked
  75,37,Was he not a drop of ejaculated sperm
  75,38,then a blood-clot which He created and shaped
  75,39,"making from it both sexes, male and female"
  75,40,Is He who does this not able to bring the dead to life
  76,1,Has man ever known a point of time when he was not something remembered
  76,2,"We created man from a mingled drop to test him, and We made him hearing and seeing"
  76,3,"We guided him on the Way, whether he is thankful or unthankful"
  76,4,We have made ready for the kafirun shackles and chains and a Searing Blaze
  76,5,The truly good will drink from a cup mixed with the coolness of camphor
