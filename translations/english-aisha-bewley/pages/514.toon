quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  48,24,"It is He who held their hands back from you, and your hands from them in the valley of Makka, after giving you the upper hand over them. Allah sees what you do"
  48,25,"They are those who were kafir and debarred you from the Masjid al-Haram and prevented the sacrifice from reaching its proper place, and had it not been for some men and women who are muminun, whom you did not know and might trample underfoot, and so unknowingly incur blame on their account — so that Allah might admit into His mercy those He wills — and had those among them who are kafir been clearly distinguishable, We would have punished them with a painful punishment"
  48,26,"Those who are kafir filled their hearts with fanatical rage — the fanatical rage of the Time of Ignorance and Allah sent down serenity to His Messenger and to the muminun, and bound them to the expression of taqwa which they had most right to and were most entitled to. Allah has knowledge of all things"
  48,27,"Allah has confirmed His Messenger´s vision with truth: ´You will enter the Masjid al-Haram in safety, Allah willing, shaving your heads and cutting your hair without any fear.´ He knew what you did not know and ordained, in place of this, an imminent victory"
  48,28,It is He who sent His Messenger with the Guidance and the Deen of Truth to exalt it over every other deen and Allah suffices as a witness
