quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,73,"O Prophet, do jihad against the kafirun and hypocrites and be harsh with them. Their shelter will be Hell. What an evil destination"
  9,74,"They swear by Allah that they said nothing, but they definitely spoke the word of kufr and returned to kufr after their Islam. They planned something which they did not achieve and they were vindictive for no other reason than that Allah and His Messenger had enriched them from His bounty. If they were to make tawba, it would be better for them. But if they turn away, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the Next World, and they will not find any protector or helper on the earth"
  9,75,"Among them there were some who made an agreement with Allah: ´If He gives us of His bounty we will definitely give sadaqa and be among the righteous.´"
  9,76,But when He does give them of His bounty they are tight-fisted with it and turn away
  9,77,so He has punished them by putting hypocrisy in their hearts until the day they meet Him because they failed Allah in what they promised Him and because they lied
  9,78,"Do they not know that Allah knows their secrets and their private talk, and that Allah is the Knower of all unseen things"
  9,79,"As for the people who find fault with those muminun who give sadaqa spontaneously, and with those who can find nothing to give but their own effort, and deride them, Allah derides them. They will have a painful punishment"
