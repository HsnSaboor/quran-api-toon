quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  27,45,"To Thamud We sent their brother Salih telling them to worship Allah, and straightaway they divided in two, arguing with one another"
  27,46,"He said, ´My people, why are you so anxious to hasten the bad before the good? If only you would ask for forgiveness from Allah, so that mercy might perhaps be shown to you.´"
  27,47,"They said, ´We see you, and those with you, as an evil omen.´ He said, ´No, your evil omen is with Allah; you are merely a people undergoing a trial.´"
  27,48,There was a group of nine men in the city causing corruption in the land and not putting things right
  27,49,"They said, ´Let us make an oath to one another by Allah that we will fall on him and his family in the night and then say to his protector, \"We did not witness the destruction of his family and we are telling the truth.\"´"
  27,50,They hatched a plot and We hatched a plot while they were not aware
  27,51,So look at the end result of all their plotting; We utterly destroyed them and their whole people
  27,52,These are the ruins of their houses because of the wrong they did. There is certainly a Sign in that for people with knowledge
  27,53,We rescued those who had iman and who had taqwa
  27,54,"And when Lut said to his people: ´Do you approach depravity with open eyes"
  27,55,Do you come with lust to men instead of women? You are a people who are deeply ignorant.´
