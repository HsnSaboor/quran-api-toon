quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  42,23,"That is the good news which Allah gives to His slaves who have iman and do right actions. Say: ´I do not ask you for any wage for this — except for you to love your near of kin. If anyone does a good action, We will increase the good of it for him. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Thankful.´"
  42,24,"Or do they ask, ´Has he invented a lie about Allah?´ If Allah willed, He could seal up your heart. By His Words Allah wipes out the false and confirms the truth. He knows what the heart contains"
  42,25,It is He who accepts tawba from His slaves and pardons evil acts and knows what they do
  42,26,He responds to those who have iman and do right actions and gives them increase from His favour. But the kafirun will have a harsh punishment
  42,27,"Were Allah to expand the provision of His slaves, they would act as tyrants on the earth. But He sends down whatever He wills in a measured way. He is aware of and He sees His slaves"
  42,28,"It is He who sends down abundant rain, after they have lost all hope, and unfolds His mercy. He is the Protector, the Praiseworthy"
  42,29,Among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and all the creatures He has spread about in them. And He has the power to gather them together whenever He wills
  42,30,Any disaster that strikes you is through what your own hands have earned and He pardons much
  42,31,You will not be able to thwart Him on the earth and you have no protector or helper besides Allah
