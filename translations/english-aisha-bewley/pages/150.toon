quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,158,"What are they waiting for but for the angels to come to them or for your Lord Himself to come, or for one of your Lord´s Signs to come? On the day that one of your Lord´s Signs does come, no iman which a self professes will be of any use to it if it did not have iman before and earn good in its iman. Say: ´Wait, then; We too are waiting.´"
  6,159,"As for those who divide up their deen and form into sects, you have nothing whatsoever to do with them. Their affair will go back to Allah and then He will inform them about what they did"
  6,160,Those who produce a good action will receive ten like it. But those who produce a bad action will only be repaid with its equivalent and they will not be wronged
  6,161,"Say: ´My Lord has guided me to a straight path, a well-founded deen, the religion of Ibrahim, a man of pure natural belief. He was not one of the idolaters.´"
  6,162,"Say: ´My salat and my rites, my living and my dying, are for Allah alone, the Lord of all the worlds"
  6,163,Who has no partner. I am commanded to be like that and I am the first of the Muslims.´
  6,164,"Say: ´Am I to desire other than Allah as Lord when He is the Lord of all things?´ What each self earns is for itself alone. No burden-bearer can bear another´s burden. Then you will return to your Lord, and He will inform you regarding the things about which you differed"
  6,165,"It is He who appointed you khalifs on the earth and raised some of you above others in rank so He could test you regarding what He has given you. Your Lord is Swift in Retribution; and He is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
