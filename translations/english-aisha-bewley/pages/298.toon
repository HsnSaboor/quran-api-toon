quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  18,35,"He entered his garden and wronged himself by saying, ´I do not think that this will ever end"
  18,36,"I do not think the Hour will ever come. But if I should be sent back to my Lord, I will definitely get something better in return.´"
  18,37,"His companion, with whom he was debating, said to him, ´Do you then disbelieve in Him who created you from dust, then from a drop of sperm, and then formed you as a man"
  18,38,"He is, however, Allah, my Lord, and I will not associate anyone with my Lord"
  18,39,"Why, when you entered your garden, did you not say, \"It is as Allah wills, there is no strength but in Allah\"? Though you see me with less wealth and children than you possess"
  18,40,it may well be that my Lord will give me something better than your garden and send down on it a fireball from the sky so that morning finds it a shifting heap of dust
  18,41,or morning finds its water drained into the earth so that you cannot get at it.´
  18,42,"The fruits of his labour were completely destroyed and he woke up wringing his hands in grief, rueing everything that he had spent on it. It was a ruin with all its trellises fallen in. He said, ´Oh, if only I had not associated anyone with my Lord!´"
  18,43,"There was no group to come to his aid, besides Allah, and he was not given any help"
  18,44,"In that situation the only protection is from Allah, the Real. He gives the best reward and the best outcome"
  18,45,Make a metaphor for them of the life of this world. It is like water which We send down from the sky and the plants of the earth combine with it but then become dry chaff scattered by the winds. Allah has absolute power over everything
