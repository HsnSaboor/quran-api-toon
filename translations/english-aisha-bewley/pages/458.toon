  38,84,"He said, ´By the truth — and I speak the truth —"
  38,85,I will fill up Hell with you and every one of them who follows you.´
  38,86,"Say: ´I do not ask you for any wage for it, nor am I a man of false pretensions"

  39,1,"The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Almighty, the All-Wise"
  39,2,"We have sent down the Book to you with truth. So worship Allah, making your deen sincerely His"
  39,3,Indeed is the sincere deen not Allah´s alone? If people take protectors besides Him — ´We only worship them so that they may bring us nearer to Allah´ — Allah will judge between them regarding the things about which they differed. Allah does not guide anyone who is an ungrateful liar
  39,4,"If Allah had desired to have a son He would have chosen whatever He wished from what He has created. Glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the All-Conquering"
  39,5,"He created the heavens and the earth with truth. He wraps the night around the day and wraps the day around the night, and has made the sun and moon subservient, each one running for a specified term. Is He not indeed the Almighty, the Endlessly Forgiving"
