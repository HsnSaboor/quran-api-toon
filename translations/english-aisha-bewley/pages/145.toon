quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,132,All have ranks according to what they did. Your Lord is not unaware of what they do
  6,133,"Your Lord is the Rich Beyond Need, the Possessor of Mercy. If He wanted, He could remove you and replace you with anything else He wanted to, just as He produced you from the descendants of another people"
  6,134,What you are promised will come about and you can do nothing to prevent it
  6,135,"Say: ´My people, do as you are doing, just as I am doing. You will certainly come to know who will have the best home in the end. The wrongdoers will certainly not be successful.´"
  6,136,"They assign to Allah a share of the crops and livestock He has created, saying, ´This is for Allah,´ — as they allege — ´and this is for our idols.´ Their idols´ share does not reach Allah whereas Allah´s share reaches their idols! What an evil judgement they make"
  6,137,"In the same way their idols have made killing their children appear good to many of the idolaters, in order to destroy them and confuse them in their deen. If Allah had willed, they would not have done it; so abandon them and what they fabricate"
