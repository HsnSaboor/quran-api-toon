quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,90,The fact is that We have given them the truth and they are liars
  23,91,"Allah has no son and there is no other god accompanying Him, for then each god would have gone off with what he created and one of them would have been exalted above the other. Glory be to Allah above what they describe"
  23,92,Knower of the Unseen and the Visible! May He be exalted above all they associate with Him
  23,93,"Say: ´My Lord, if You let me see what they have been promised"
  23,94,"do not then, my Lord, put me among the wrongdoing people!´"
  23,95,We are certainly capable of letting you see what We have promised them
  23,96,Ward off evil with what is better. We know very well what they express
  23,97,"Say: ´My Lord, I seek refuge with You from the goadings of the shaytans"
  23,98,"and I seek refuge with You, my Lord, from their presence.´"
  23,99,"When death comes to one of them, he says, ´My Lord, send me back again"
  23,100,so that perhaps I may act rightly regarding the things I failed to do!´ No indeed! It is just words he utters. Before them there is an interspace until the Day they are raised up
  23,101,"Then when the Trumpet is blown, that Day there will be no family ties between them; they will not be able to question one another"
  23,102,"Those whose scales are heavy, they are the successful"
  23,103,"Those whose scales are light, they are the losers of their selves, remaining in Hell timelessly, for ever"
  23,104,"The Fire will sear their faces, making them grimace horribly in it, their lips drawn back from their teeth"
