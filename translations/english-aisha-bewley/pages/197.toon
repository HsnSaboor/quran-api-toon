quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,62,"They swear to you by Allah in order to please you, but it would be more fitting for them to please Allah and His Messenger if they are muminun"
  9,63,"Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger, will have the Fire of Hell, remaining in it timelessly, for ever? That is the great disgrace"
  9,64,"The hypocrites are afraid that a sura may be sent down about them, informing them of what is in their hearts. Say: ´Go on mocking! Allah will expose everything you are afraid of.´"
  9,65,"If you ask them they will say, ´We were only joking and playing around.´ Say: ´Would you make a mockery of Allah and of His Signs and of His Messenger"
  9,66,"Do not try to excuse yourselves. You have become kafir after having iman. If one group of you is pardoned, another group will be punished for being evildoers.´"
  9,67,"The men and women of the hypocrites are as bad as one another. They command what is wrong and forbid what is right and keep their fists tightly closed. They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them. The hypocrites are deviators"
  9,68,"Allah has promised the men and women of the hypocrites and kafirun the Fire of Hell, remaining in it timelessly, for ever. It will suffice them. Allah has cursed them. They will have everlasting punishment"
