quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  8,70,"O Prophet! say to those you are holding prisoner, ´If Allah knows of any good in your hearts, He will give you something better than what has been taken from you and forgive you.´ Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  8,71,"But if they mean to betray you, they have already previously betrayed Allah, so He has given you power over them. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  8,72,"Those who have iman and have made hijra and done jihad with their wealth and themselves in the Way of Allah, and those who have given refuge and help, they are the friends and protectors of one another. But as for those who have iman but have not made hijra, you are not in any way responsible for their protection until they make hijra. But if they ask you for help in respect of the deen, it is your duty to help them, except against people you have a treaty with. Allah sees what you do"
  8,73,Those who are kafir are the friends and protectors of one another. If you do not act in this way there will be turmoil in the land and great corruption
  8,74,"Those who have iman and have made hijra and done jihad in the Way of Allah and those who have given refuge and help, they are the true muminun. They will have forgiveness and generous provision"
  8,75,"Those who have iman and make hijra later on and accompany you in doing jihad, they also are of your number. But blood relations are closer to one another in the Book of Allah. Allah has knowledge of all things"
