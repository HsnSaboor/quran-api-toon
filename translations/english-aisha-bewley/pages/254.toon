  13,37,"Accordingly We have sent it down as a judgement in Arabic. If you followed their whims and desires after the knowledge that has come to you, you would have no protector or defender against Allah"
  13,38,We sent Messengers before you and gave them wives and children. Nor was any Messenger able to bring a Sign except by Allah´s permission. There is a prescribed limit to every term

  13,42,"Those before them plotted but all plotting belongs to Allah. He knows what each self earns, and the kafir will soon know who has the Ultimate Abode"
