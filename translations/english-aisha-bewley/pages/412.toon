quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  31,12,"We gave Luqman wisdom: ´Give thanks to Allah. Whoever gives thanks only does so to his own good. Whoever is ungrateful, Allah is Rich Beyond Need, Praiseworthy.´"
  31,13,"When Luqman said to his son, counselling him, ´My son, do not associate anything with Allah. Associating others with Him is a terrible wrong.´"
  31,14,"We have instructed man concerning his parents. Bearing him caused his mother great debility and the period of his weaning was two years: ´Give thanks to Me and to your parents. I am your final destination"
  31,15,"But if they try to make you associate something with Me about which you have no knowledge, do not obey them. Keep company with them correctly and courteously in this world but follow the Way of him who turns to Me. Then you will return to Me and I will inform you about the things you did.´"
  31,16,"´My son, even if something weighs as little as a mustard-seed and is inside a rock or anywhere else in the heavens or earth, Allah will bring it out. Allah is All-Pervading, All-Aware"
  31,17,"My son, establish salat and command what is right and forbid what is wrong and be steadfast in the face of all that happens to you. That is certainly the most resolute course to follow"
  31,18,Do not avert your face from people out of haughtiness and do not strut about arrogantly on the earth. Allah does not love anyone who is vain or boastful
  31,19,Be moderate in your tread and lower your voice. The most hateful of voices is the donkey´s bray.´
