  5,116,"And when Allah says, ´´Isa son of Maryam! Did you say to people, \"Take me and my mother as gods besides Allah?\"´ he will say, ´Glory be to You! It is not for me to say what I have no right to say! If I had said it, then You would have known it. You know what is in my self but I do not know what is in Your Self. You are the Knower of all unseen things"
  5,117,"I said to them nothing but what You ordered me to say: \"Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.\" I was a witness against them as long as I remained among them, but when You took me back to You, You were the One watching over them. You are Witness of all things"
