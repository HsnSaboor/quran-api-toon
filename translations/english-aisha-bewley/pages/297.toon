quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,28,"Restrain yourself patiently with those who call on their Lord morning and evening, desiring His face. Do not turn your eyes from them, desiring the attractions of this world. And do not obey someone whose heart We have made neglectful of Our remembrance and who follows his own whims and desires and whose life has transgressed all bounds"
  18,29,"Say: ´It is the truth from your Lord; so let whoever wishes have iman and whoever wishes be kafir.´ We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire whose billowing walls of smoke will hem them in. If they call for help, they will be helped with water like seething molten brass, frying their faces. What a noxious drink! What an evil repose"
  18,30,"But as for those who have iman and do right actions, We will not let the wage of good-doers go to waste"
  18,31,"They will have Gardens of Eden with rivers flowing under them. They will be adorned in them with bracelets made of gold and wear green garments made of the finest silk and rich brocade, reclining there on couches under canopies. What an excellent reward! What a wonderful repose"
  18,32,"Make an example for them of two men. To one of them We gave two gardens of grape-vines and surrounded them with date-palms, putting between them some cultivated land"
  18,33,"Both gardens yielded their crops and did not suffer any loss, and We made a river flow right through the middle of them"
  18,34,"He was a man of wealth and property and he said to his companion, debating with him, ´I have more wealth than you and more people under me.´"
