  4,155,"Because of the fact that they broke their covenant, and rejected Allah´s Signs, and killed the Prophets without any right to do so and said, ´Our hearts are uncircumcised,´ Allah has stamped them with kufr, so they do not have iman except for very few"
  4,156,"And on account of their kufr, and their utterance of a monstrous slander against Maryam"
  4,157,"and their saying, ´We killed the Messiah, ´Isa son of Maryam, Messenger of Allah.´ They did not kill him and they did not crucify him but it was made to seem so to them. Those who argue about him are in doubt about it. They have no real knowledge of it, just conjecture. But they certainly did not kill him"

  4,161,"and because of their practising usury when they were forbidden to do it, and because of their consuming people´s wealth by wrongful means, We have prepared for the kafirun among them a painful punishment"
  4,162,"But those of them who are firmly rooted in knowledge, and the muminun, have iman in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you: those who establish salat and pay zakat, and have iman in Allah and the Last Day — We will pay such people an immense wage"
