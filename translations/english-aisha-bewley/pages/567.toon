quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  69,9,Pharaoh and those before him and the Overturned Cities made a great mistake
  69,10,They disobeyed the Messenger of their Lord so He seized them in an ever-tightening grip
  69,11,When the waters rose We carried you in the ship
  69,12,to make it a reminder for you and something to be retained by retentive ears
  69,13,So when the Trumpet is blown with a single blast
  69,14,and the earth and the mountains are lifted and crushed with a single blow
  69,15,"On that Day, the Occurrence will occur"
  69,16,"and Heaven will be split apart, for that Day it will be very frail"
  69,17,"The angels will be gathered round its edge. On that Day, eight will bear the Throne of their Lord above their heads"
  69,18,On that Day you will be exposed — no concealed act you did will stay concealed
  69,19,"As for him who is given his Book in his right hand, he will say, ´Here, come and read my Book"
  69,20,I counted on meeting my Reckoning.´
  69,21,He will have a very pleasant life
  69,22,in an elevated Garden
  69,23,its ripe fruit hanging close to hand
  69,24,´Eat and drink with relish for what you did before in days gone by!´
  69,25,"But as for him who is given his Book in his left hand, he will say, ´If only I had not been given my Book"
  69,26,and had not known about my Reckoning
  69,27,If only death had really been the end
  69,28,My wealth has been of no use to me
  69,29,My power has vanished.´
  69,30,´Seize him and truss him up
  69,31,Then roast him in the Blazing Fire
  69,32,Then bind him in a chain which is seventy cubits long
  69,33,He used not to have iman in Allah the Magnificent
  69,34,nor did he urge the feeding of the poor
