  22,17,"As for those who have iman and those who are Jews and the Sabaeans and the Christians, Magians and idolaters, Allah will distinguish between them on the Day of Rising. Allah is witness of all things"
  22,18,"Do you not see that everyone in the heavens and everyone on the earth prostrates to Allah, and the sun and moon and stars and the mountains, trees and beasts and many of mankind? But many of them inevitably merit punishment. Those Allah humiliates will have no one to honour them. Allah does whatever He wills"
  22,19,"Here are two rival groups who disputed concerning their Lord. Those who are kafir will have garments of fire cut out for them, and boiling water poured over their heads"
