quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,45,Allah knows best who your enemies are. Allah suffices as a Protector; Allah suffices as a Helper
  4,46,"Some of the Jews distort the true meaning of words, saying,´We hear and disobey,´ and ´Listen without listening,´ and ´Ra´ina!´ twisting them with their tongues, disparaging the deen. If they had said, ´We hear and we obey,´ and ´Listen,´ and, ´Undhurna!´ that would have been better for them and more upright. But Allah has cursed them for their kufr. Very few of them have iman"
  4,47,"You who have been given the Book! have iman in what We have sent down confirming what is with you, before We obliterate faces, turning them inside out, or We curse you as We cursed the Companions of the Sabbath. Allah´s command is always carried out"
  4,48,Allah does not forgive anything being associated with Him but He forgives whoever He wills for anything other than that. Anyone who associates something with Allah has committed a terrible crime
  4,49,"Do you not see those who claim to be purified? No, Allah purifies whoever He wills. They will not be wronged by so much as the smallest speck"
  4,50,Look how they invent lies against Allah. That suffices as an outright felony
  4,51,"Do you not see those who were given a portion of the Book having iman in idols and false gods and saying to those who are kafir, ´These people are better guided on their path than the muminun´"
