quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  13,19,Is he who knows that what has been sent down to you from your Lord is the truth like him who is blind? It is only people of intelligence who pay heed
  13,20,those who fulfil Allah´s contract and do not break their agreement
  13,21,those who join what Allah has commanded to be joined and are afraid of their Lord and fear an evil Reckoning
  13,22,"those who are steadfast in seeking the face of their Lord, and establish salat and give from the provision We have given them, secretly and openly, and stave off evil with good, it is they who will have the Ultimate Abode —"
  13,23,"Gardens of Eden which they will enter, and all of their parents, wives and children who were righteous. Angels will enter in to welcome them from every gate: ´Peace be upon you because of your steadfastness"
  13,24,How wonderful is the Ultimate Abode!´
  13,25,"But as for those who break Allah´s contract after it has been agreed and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and cause corruption in the earth, the curse will be upon them. They will have the Evil Abode"
  13,26,"Allah expands provision to anyone He wills and restricts it. They rejoice in the life of this world. Yet the life of this world, compared to the Next World, is only fleeting enjoyment"
  13,27,"Those who are kafir say, ´Why has a Sign not been sent down to him from his Lord?´ Say: ´Allah misguides whoever He wills and guides to Himself all who turn to Him"
  13,28,those who have iman and whose hearts find peace in the remembrance of Allah. Only in the remembrance of Allah can the heart find peace.´
