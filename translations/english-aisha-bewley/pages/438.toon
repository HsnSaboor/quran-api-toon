quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  35,31,"What We have revealed to you of the Book is the truth, confirming what came before it. Allah is aware of and sees His slaves"
  35,32,Then We made Our chosen slaves inherit the Book. But some of them wrong themselves; some are ambivalent; and some outdo each other in good by Allah´s permission. That is the great favour
  35,33,"They will enter Gardens of Eden where they will be adorned with gold bracelets and pearls, and where their clothing will be of silk"
  35,34,"They will say, ´Praise be to Allah who has removed all sadness from us. Truly our Lord is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Thankful"
  35,35,"He who has lodged us, out of His favour, in the Abode of Permanence where no weariness or fatigue affects us.´"
  35,36,Whereas for those who are kafir there will be the Fire of Hell. They will not be killed off so that they die and its punishment will not be lightened for them. That is how We repay every thankless man
  35,37,"They will shout out in it, ´Our Lord! take us out! We will act rightly, differently from the way we used to act!´ Did We not let you live long enough for anyone who was going to pay heed to pay heed? And did not the warner come to you? Taste it then! There is no helper for the wrongdoers"
  35,38,Allah knows the Unseen of the heavens and earth. Allah knows what the heart contains
