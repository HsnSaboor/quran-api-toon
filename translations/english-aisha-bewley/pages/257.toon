quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  14,11,"Their Messengers said to them, ´We are nothing but human beings like yourselves. But Allah shows favour to any of His slaves He wills. It is not for us to bring you an authority except by Allah´s permission. So let the muminun put their trust in Allah"
  14,12,And why indeed should we not put our trust in Allah when He has guided us to our ways? We will be steadfast however much you harm us. Those who trust put their trust in Allah.´
  14,13,"Those who were kafir said to their Messengers, ´We will drive you from our land unless you return to our religion.´ Their Lord revealed to them, ´We will destroy those who do wrong"
  14,14,We will leave you the land to live in after them. That is the reward of those who fear My station and fear My threat.´
  14,15,"They asked for Allah´s victory, and every obdurate tyrant failed"
  14,16,And beyond him is Hell where he will be given pus to drink
  14,17,He gulps at it but can hardly swallow it down. Death comes at him from every side but he does not die. And beyond him is relentless punishment
  14,18,The metaphor of those who reject their Lord is that their actions are like ashes scattered by strong winds on a stormy day. They have no power at all over anything they have earned. That is extreme misguidance
