quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Have you seen him who rejects Our Signs and says, ´I will certainly be given wealth and children there.´"
  19,78,Has he surveyed the Unseen or has he a contract with the All-Merciful
  19,79,No indeed! We will write down what he says and prolong the punishment for him
  19,80,We will inherit from him the things he is talking about and he will come to Us all alone
  19,81,They have taken other gods besides Allah to be a source of power and strength for them
  19,82,No indeed! They will reject their worship and will be opposed to them
  19,83,Do you not see that We send the shaytans against those who are kafir to goad them on
  19,84,So do not try to hasten their punishment. We are simply counting out the number of their days
  19,85,On that Day We will gather those who have taqwa to the All-Merciful with due ceremony
  19,86,"But We will drive the evildoers to Hell, like cattle to a watering hole"
  19,87,They have no right of intercession. None do but those who have a contract with the All-Merciful
  19,88,"They say, ´The All-Merciful has a son.´"
  19,89,They have devised a monstrous thing
  19,90,The heavens are all but rent apart and the earth split open and the mountains brought crashing down
  19,91,at their ascription of a son to the All-Merciful
  19,92,It is not fitting for the All-Merciful to have a son
  19,93,There is no one in the heavens and earth who will not come to the All-Merciful as a slave
  19,94,He has counted them and numbered them precisely
  19,95,Each of them will come to Him on the Day of Rising all alone
