quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,"My people! I do not ask you for any wealth for it. My wage is the responsibility of Allah alone. I will not chase away those who have iman. They are surely going to meet their Lord. However, I see you as ignorant people"
  11,30,My people! Who would help me against Allah if I did drive them away? So will you not pay heed
  11,31,"I do not say to you that I possess the treasuries of Allah; nor do I know the Unseen; nor do I say that I am an angel; nor do I say to those who are vile in your eyes that Allah will not give them any good. Allah knows best what is in their hearts. If I did, I would certainly be one of the wrongdoers.´"
  11,32,"They said, ´Nuh, you have argued with us and argued much so bring us what you have promised us if you are telling the truth.´"
  11,33,"He said, ´Allah will bring it to you if He wills and you will not be able to prevent it"
  11,34,"My counsel will not benefit you, for all my desire to counsel you, if Allah desires to lead you into error. He is your Lord and you will return to Him.´"
  11,35,"Or do they say, ´He has invented it´? Say: ´If I have invented it the crime will be laid at my door, but I am innocent of the crimes which you commit.´"
  11,36,"It was revealed to Nuh: ´None of your people are going to have iman except for those who already have iman, so do not be distressed at what they do"
  11,37,Build the Ark under Our supervision and as We reveal and do not address Me concerning the wrongdoers. They shall be drowned.´
