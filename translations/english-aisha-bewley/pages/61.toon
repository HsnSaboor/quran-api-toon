quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,84,"Say, ´We have iman in Allah and what has been sent down to us and what was sent down to Ibrahim, Isma´il and Ishaq and Ya´qub and the Tribes, and what Musa and ´Isa and all the Prophets were given by their Lord. We do not differentiate between any of them. We are Muslims submitted to Him.´"
  3,85,"If anyone desires anything other than Islam as a deen, it will not be accepted from him, and in the Next World he will be among the losers"
  3,86,How can Allah guide a people who have become kafir after having had iman? They bore witness that the Messenger was true and that the Clear Signs had come to them. Allah does not guide people who are wrongdoers
  3,87,The repayment of such people is that Allah´s curse is on them and that of the angels and of all mankind
  3,88,They will be under it for ever. Their punishment will not be lightened. They will be granted no reprieve
  3,89,"Except for those who, after that, make tawba and put things right. Truly Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  3,90,"Those who become kafir after having iman and then increase in their kufr, their tawba will not be accepted. They are the misguided"
  3,91,"As for those who are kafir and die kuffar, the whole earth filled with gold would not be accepted from any of them if they were to offer it as a ransom. They will have a painful punishment. They will have no helpers"
