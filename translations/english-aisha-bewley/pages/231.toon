  11,82,"When Our command came, We turned their cities upside down and rained down on them stones of hard baked clay"
  11,83,"piled on top of one another in layers, each one earmarked by your Lord. And they are never far from the wrongdoers"
  11,84,"And to Madyan their brother Shu´ayb. He said, ´My people, worship Allah! You have no god apart from Him. Do not give short measure and short weight. I see you prospering and I fear for you the punishment of an all-encompassing Day"
  11,85,"My people! Give full measure and full weight with justice; do not diminish people´s goods; and do not go about the earth, corrupting it"

  11,87,"They said, ´Shu´ayb, do your prayers instruct you that we should abandon what our fathers worshipped or stop doing whatever we want to with our wealth? You are clearly the forbearing, the rightly-guided!´"
  11,88,"He said, ´My people! What do you think? If I do possess a Clear Sign from my Lord and He has given me His good provision, I would clearly not want to go behind your backs and do something I have forbidden you to do. I only want to put things right as far as I can. My success is with Allah alone. I have put my trust in Him and I turn to Him"
