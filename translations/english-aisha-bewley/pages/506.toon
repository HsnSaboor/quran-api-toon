quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  46,29,"And We diverted a group of jinn towards you to listen to the Qur´an. When they were in earshot of it they said, ´Be quiet and listen.´ When it was over they went back to their people, warning them"
  46,30,"They said, ´Our people, we have heard a Book which was sent down after Musa, confirming what came before it, guiding to the truth and to a straight path"
  46,31,"Our people, respond to Allah´s caller and believe in Him. He will forgive you some of your wrong actions and save you from a painful punishment"
  46,32,Those who do not respond to Allah´s caller cannot thwart Allah on earth and have no protectors apart from Him. Such people are clearly misguided.´
  46,33,Do they not see that Allah — He who created the heavens and the earth and was not wearied by creating them — has the power to bring the dead to life? Yes indeed! He has power over all things
  46,34,"On the Day when those who were kafir are exposed to the Fire, they will be asked, ´Is this not the truth?´ They will say, ´Yes, by our Lord.´ He will say, ´Then taste the punishment for having been kafir.´"
  46,35,"So be steadfast as the Messengers with firm resolve were also steadfast. And do not seek to hasten it for them. On the Day they see what they were promised, it will be as if they had only tarried for just one hour of a single day. It has been transmitted! Will any be destroyed except for deviant people"
