quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,98,"How is it that there has never been a city that had iman, whose iman then brought it benefit, except the people of Yunus? When they had iman We removed from them the punishment of disgrace in the life of this world and We let them have enjoyment for a time"
  10,99,"If your Lord had willed, all the people on the earth would have had iman. Do you think you can force people to be muminun"
  10,100,No self can have iman except with Allah´s permission. He places a blight on those who do not use their intellect
  10,101,"Say: ´Look at what there is in the heavens and on the earth.´ But Signs and warnings are of no avail to people who have no iman"
  10,102,"What are they waiting for but the same fate as those who passed away before them? Say: ´Wait, I will be among the people waiting with you.´"
  10,103,Then We will rescue Our Messengers and those who have iman as well. It is incumbent upon Us to rescue the muminun
  10,104,"Say: ´Mankind! if you are in any doubt about my deen, I do not worship those you worship besides Allah. Rather I worship Allah who will take you back to Him and I am commanded to be one of the muminun"
  10,105,"Turn your face towards the deen in pure natural faith, and on no account be among the idolaters"
  10,106,"Do not call on something besides Allah which can neither help nor harm you. If you do, you will then be wrongdoers.´"
