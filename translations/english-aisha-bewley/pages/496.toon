quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  44,1,Ha Mim
  44,2,By the Book which makes things clear
  44,3,We sent it down on a blessed night; We are constantly giving warning
  44,4,During it every wise decree is specified
  44,5,by a command from Our presence. We are constantly sending out
  44,6,"as a mercy from your Lord. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing"
  44,7,"the Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything in between them, if you are people with certainty"
  44,8,"There is no god but Him — He gives life and causes to die — your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers, the previous peoples"
  44,9,Yet they play around in doubt
  44,10,So be on the watch for a day when heaven brings forth a distinctive smoke
  44,11,which enshrouds mankind. ´This is a painful punishment
  44,12,"Our Lord, remove the punishment from us. We are really muminun.´"
  44,13,How can they expect a Reminder when a clear Messenger has already come to them
  44,14,"But then they turned away from him and said, ´He is an instructed madman!´"
  44,15,"We remove the punishment a little, and you revert"
  44,16,On the day We launch the Great Assault We will certainly take Our revenge
  44,17,"Before them We put Pharaoh´s people to the test when a noble Messenger came to them, saying"
  44,18,´Hand over to me the slaves of Allah. I am a trustworthy Messenger to you.´
