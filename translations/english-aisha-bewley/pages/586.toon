quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun is compacted in blackness
  81,2,when the stars fall in rapid succession
  81,3,when the mountains are set in motion
  81,4,when the camels in foal are neglected
  81,5,when the wild beasts are all herded together
  81,6,when the oceans surge into each other
  81,7,when the selves are arranged into classes
  81,8,when the baby girl buried alive is asked
  81,9,for what crime she was killed
  81,10,when the Pages are opened up
  81,11,when the Heaven is peeled away
  81,12,when the Fire is set ablaze
  81,13,when the Garden is brought up close
  81,14,then each self will know what it has done
  81,15,No! I swear by the planets with their retrograde motion
  81,16,"swiftly moving, self-concealing"
  81,17,and by the night when it draws in
  81,18,and by the dawn when it exhales
  81,19,truly it is the speech of a noble Messenger
  81,20,"possessing great strength, securely placed with the Lord of the Throne"
  81,21,"obeyed there, trustworthy"
  81,22,Your companion is not mad
  81,23,He saw him on the clear horizon
  81,24,Nor is he miserly with the Unseen
  81,25,Nor is it the word of an accursed Shaytan
  81,26,"So where, then, are you going"
  81,27,It is nothing but a Reminder to all the worlds
  81,28,to whoever among you wishes to go straight
  81,29,"But you will not will unless Allah wills, the Lord of all the Worlds"
