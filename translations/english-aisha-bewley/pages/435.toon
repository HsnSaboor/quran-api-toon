quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  35,4,"If they deny you, Messengers before you were also denied. All matters return to Allah"
  35,5,Mankind! Allah´s promise is true. Do not let the life of the dunya delude you and do not let the Deluder delude you about Allah
  35,6,Shaytan is your enemy so treat him as an enemy. He summons his party so they will be among the people of the Searing Blaze
  35,7,Those who are kafir will suffer a harsh punishment. But those who have iman and do right actions will receive forgiveness and an immense reward
  35,8,And what of him the evil of whose actions appears fine to him so that he sees them as good? Allah misguides whoever He wills and guides whoever He wills. So do not let yourself waste away out of regret for them. Allah knows what they do
  35,9,It is Allah who sends the winds which raise the clouds which We then drive to a dead land and by them bring the earth to life after it was dead. That is how the Resurrection will be
  35,10,"If anyone wants power, all power belongs to Allah. All good words rise to Him and virtuous deeds elevate them. But people who plot evil deeds will suffer a harsh punishment. The plotting of such people is profitless"
  35,11,Allah created you from dust and then from a drop of sperm and then made you into pairs. No female becomes pregnant or gives birth except with His knowledge. And no living thing lives long or has its life cut short without that being in a Book. That is easy for Allah
