quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,No indeed! The book of the dissolute is in Sijjin
  83,8,And what will convey to you what Sijjin is
  83,9,A clearly written Book
  83,10,Woe that Day to the deniers
  83,11,those who deny the Day of Reckoning
  83,12,No one denies it except for every evil aggressor
  83,13,"When Our Signs are recited to him, he says, ´Just myths and legends of the previous peoples!´"
  83,14,No indeed! Rather what they have earned has rusted up their hearts
  83,15,No indeed! Rather that Day they will be veiled from their Lord
  83,16,Then they will roast in the Blazing Fire
  83,17,"Then they will be told, ´This is what you denied.´"
  83,18,No indeed! The book of the truly good is in ´Illiyun
  83,19,And what will convey to you what ´Illiyun is
  83,20,A clearly written book
  83,21,Those brought near will witness it
  83,22,The truly good will be in perfect Bliss
  83,23,on couches gazing in wonder
  83,24,You will recognise in their faces the radiance of delight
  83,25,They are given the choicest sealed wine to drink
  83,26,whose seal is musk — let people with aspiration aspire to that! —
  83,27,mixed with Tasnim
  83,28,a fountain at which Those Brought Near will drink
  83,29,Those who did evil used to laugh at those who had iman
  83,30,"When they passed by them, they would wink at one another"
  83,31,"When they returned to their families, they would make a joke of them"
  83,32,"When they saw them, they would say, ´Those people are misguided.´"
  83,33,But they were not sent as guardians over them
  83,34,So today those who have iman are laughing at the kuffar
