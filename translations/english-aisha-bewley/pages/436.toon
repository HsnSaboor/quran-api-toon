quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  35,12,"The two seas are not the same: the one is sweet, refreshing, delicious to drink, the other salty, bitter to the taste. Yet from both of them you eat fresh flesh and extract ornaments for yourselves to wear; and you see ships on them, cleaving through the waves so that you can seek His bounty and so that hopefully you will be thankful"
  35,13,"He makes night merge into day and day merge into night, and He has made the sun and moon subservient, each one running until a specified time. That is Allah, your Lord. The Kingdom is His. Those you call on besides Him have no power over even the smallest speck"
  35,14,"If you call on them they will not hear your call, and were they to hear, they would not respond to you. On the Day of Rising they will reject your making associates of them. No one can inform you like One who is All-aware"
  35,15,"Mankind! you are the poor in need of Allah whereas Allah is the Rich Beyond Need, the Praiseworthy"
  35,16,If He wills He can dispense with you and bring about a new creation
  35,17,That is not difficult for Allah
  35,18,"No burden-bearer can bear another´s burden. If someone weighed down calls for help to bear his load, none of it will be borne for him, even by his next of kin. You can only warn those who fear their Lord in the Unseen and establish salat. Whoever is purified, is purified for himself alone. Allah is your final destination"
