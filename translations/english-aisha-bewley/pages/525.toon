quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  52,32,Is it their intellects that direct them to say this or is it that they are an unbridled people
  52,33,"Or do they say, ´He has simply made it up´? No, the truth is they have no iman"
  52,34,Let them produce a discourse like it if they are telling the truth
  52,35,"Or were they created out of nothing, or are they the creators"
  52,36,"Or did they create the heavens and the earth? No, in truth they have no certainty"
  52,37,Or do they possess the treasuries of your Lord or do they have control of them
  52,38,Or do they have a ladder on which they listen? Then let their listener bring clear evidence
  52,39,Or does He have daughters whereas you have sons
  52,40,Or do you ask them for a wage so they are weighed down with debt
  52,41,Or is the Unseen in their hands so they can write out what is to happen
  52,42,Or do they desire to dupe you? But the duped ones are those who are kafir
  52,43,Or do they have some god other than Allah? Glory be to Allah above any idol they propose
  52,44,"If they saw a lump of heaven falling down, they would just say, ´Banked-up clouds!´"
  52,45,Leave them then until they meet their Day when they will be struck down by the Blast
  52,46,the Day their ploys will not profit them at all and they will not be helped
  52,47,And those who do wrong will have a punishment besides that but most of them do not know it
  52,48,So wait steadfastly for the judgement of your Lord — you are certainly before Our eyes. And glorify and praise your Lord when you get up
  52,49,And glorify Him in the night and when the stars fade out
