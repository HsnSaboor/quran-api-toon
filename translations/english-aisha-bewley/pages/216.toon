  10,64,there is good news for them in the life of this world and in the Next World. There is no changing the words of Allah. That is the great victory
  10,65,"Do not be grieved by what they say. All might belongs to Allah. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing"
  10,66,"Yes, indeed! Everyone in the heavens and everyone on the earth belongs to Allah. Those who call on something other than Allah are not really following their partner-gods. They are only following conjecture. They are only guessing"
  10,67,"It is He who appointed the night for you, so that you could rest in it, and the day for seeing. There are certainly Signs in that for people who listen"
  10,68,"They say, ´Allah has a son.´ Glory be to Him! He is the Rich Beyond Need. Everything in the heavens and everything on the earth belongs to Him. Have you authority to say this or are you saying about Allah what you do not know"
  10,69,"Say: ´People who invent lies against Allah will not be successful.´"
  10,70,There is the enjoyment of this world. Then they will return to Us. Then We will let them taste the terrible punishment because they were kafir
