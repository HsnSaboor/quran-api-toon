quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  47,30,"If We wished, We would show them to you and you would know them by their mark and know them by their ambivalent speech. Allah knows your actions"
  47,31,We will test you until We know the true fighters among you and those who are steadfast and test what is reported of you
  47,32,"Those who are kafir and obstruct the Way of Allah, and are entrenched in hostility towards the Messenger after the guidance has become clear to them, do not harm Allah in any way and He makes their actions come to nothing"
  47,33,You who have iman! obey Allah and obey the Messenger. Do not make your actions of no worth
  47,34,"Those who are kafir and obstruct the Way of Allah, and then die kafir, Allah will not forgive them"
  47,35,Do not become faint-hearted and call for peace when you are uppermost and Allah is with you — He would never cheat you of your deeds
  47,36,"The life of this world is merely a game and a diversion. If you have iman and taqwa, He will pay you your wages and not ask you for all your wealth"
  47,37,"If He did ask you for it and put you under pressure, you would be tight-fisted and it would bring out your malevolence"
  47,38,"Here you are then: people who are called upon to spend in the Way of Allah and then some of you are tight-fisted! But whoever is tight-fisted is only tight-fisted to himself. Allah is Rich and you are poor. If you turn away, He will replace you with a people other than yourselves and they will not be like you"
