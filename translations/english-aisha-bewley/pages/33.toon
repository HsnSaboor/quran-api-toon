quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,211,"Ask the tribe of Israel how many Clear Signs We gave to them. If anyone alters Allah´s blessing after it has come to him, Allah is fierce in retribution"
  2,212,"To those who are kafir, the life of this world is painted in glowing colours and they laugh at those who have iman. But on the Day of Rising those who fear Allah will be over them. Allah provides for whomever He wills without any reckoning"
  2,213,"Mankind was a single community. Then Allah sent out Prophets bringing good news and giving warning, and with them He sent down the Book with truth to decide between people regarding their differences. Only those who were given it differed about it, after the Clear Signs had come to them, envying one another. Then, by His permission, Allah guided those who had iman to the truth of that about which they had differed. Allah guides whomever He wills to a straight path"
  2,214,"Or did you suppose that you would enter the Garden without facing the same as those who came before you? Poverty and illness afflicted them and they were shaken to the point that the Messenger and those who had iman with him said, ´When is Allah´s help coming?´ Be assured that Allah´s help is very near"
  2,215,"They will ask you what they should give away. Say, ´Any wealth you give away should go to your parents and relatives and to orphans and the very poor and travellers.´ Whatever good you do, Allah knows it"
