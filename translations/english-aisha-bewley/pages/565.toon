quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  68,16,We will brand him on the snout
  68,17,We have tried them as We tried the owners of the garden when they swore that they would harvest in the morning
  68,18,"but did not say the redeeming words, ´If Allah wills´"
  68,19,So a visitation from your Lord came upon it while they slept
  68,20,and in the morning it was like burnt land stripped bare
  68,21,In the morning they called out to one another
  68,22,´Leave early for your land if you want to pick the fruit.´
  68,23,"So they set off, quietly saying to one another"
  68,24,´Do not let any poor man into it today while you are there.´
  68,25,"They left early, intent on carrying out their scheme"
  68,26,"But when they saw it, they said, ´We must have lost our way"
  68,27,"No, the truth is we are destitute!´"
  68,28,"The best of them said, ´Did I not say to you, \"Why do you not glorify Allah?\"´"
  68,29,"They said, ´Glory be to our Lord! Truly we have been wrongdoers.´"
  68,30,They turned to face each other in mutual accusation
  68,31,"They said, ´Woe to us! We were indeed inordinate"
  68,32,Maybe our Lord will give us something better than it in exchange. We entreat our Lord.´
  68,33,Such is the punishment. And the punishment of the Next World is much greater if they only knew
  68,34,The people who have taqwa will have Gardens of Delight with their Lord
  68,35,Would We make the Muslims the same as the evildoers
  68,36,What is the matter with you? On what basis do you judge
  68,37,Or do you have a Book which you study
  68,38,so that you may have anything in it you choose
  68,39,"Or do you have oaths which bind Us, extending to the Day of Rising, that you will have whatever you decide"
  68,40,Ask them which of them stands as guarantor for that
  68,41,Or do they have Divine partners? Then let them produce their partners if they are telling the truth
  68,42,"On the Day when legs are bared and they are called on to prostrate, they will not be able to do so"
