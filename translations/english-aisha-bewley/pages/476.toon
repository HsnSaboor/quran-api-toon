quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,78,We sent Messengers before you. Some of them We have told you about and others We have not told you about. No Messenger can bring a Sign except with Allah´s permission. But when Allah´s command comes the matter will be decided with truth and then and there the liars will be lost
  40,79,"It is Allah who has given you livestock, some for you to ride and some to eat"
  40,80,"You gain various benefits from them, and on them you can obtain what your hearts desire, and on them and on the ships you are transported"
  40,81,"He shows you His Signs, so which of Allah´s Signs do you deny"
  40,82,"Have they not travelled in the land and seen the final fate of those before them? They were more numerous than them and greater in strength and left more and deeper traces on earth, but what they earned was of no use to them"
  40,83,"When their Messengers brought them the Clear Signs, they exulted in the knowledge they had and then were engulfed by the very things they mocked"
  40,84,"When they saw Our violent force, they said, ´We have iman in Allah alone and reject what we associated with Him.´"
  40,85,But when they saw Our violent force their iman was of no use to them. That is the pattern Allah has always followed with His slaves. Then and there the kafirun were lost
