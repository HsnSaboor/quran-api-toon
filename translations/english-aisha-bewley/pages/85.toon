quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,38,"and also for those who spend their wealth to show off to people, not having iman in Allah and the Last Day. Anyone who has made Shaytan his comrade, what an evil comrade he is"
  4,39,What harm would it have done them to have had iman in Allah and the Last Day and to have given of what Allah has provided for them? Allah knows everything about them
  4,40,Allah does not wrong anyone by so much as the smallest speck. And if there is a good deed Allah will multiply it and pay out an immense reward direct from Him
  4,41,How will it be when We bring a witness from every nation and bring you as a witness against them
  4,42,On that day those who were kafir and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they were one with the level earth. They will not be able to hide a single circumstance from Allah
  4,43,"You who have iman! do not approach the prayer when you are drunk, so that you will know what you are saying, nor in a state of major impurity — unless you are travelling — until you have washed yourselves completely. If you are ill or on a journey, or any of you have come from the lavatory or touched women, and you cannot find any water, then do tayammum with pure earth, wiping your faces and your hands. Allah is Ever-Pardoning, Ever-Forgiving"
  4,44,Do you not see those who were given a portion of the Book trading in misguidance and wanting you to be misguided from the way
