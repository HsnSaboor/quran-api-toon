quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,23,Do you not see those who have been given a portion of the Book being invited to let Allah´s Book be the judge between them? But then a group of them turn away
  3,24,"That is because they say, ´The Fire will only touch us for a number of days.´ Their inventions have deluded them in their deen"
  3,25,But how will it be when We gather them all together for a Day about which there is no doubt? Every self will be paid in full for what it earned. They will not be wronged
  3,26,"Say, ´O Allah! Master of the Kingdom! You give sovereignty to whoever You will You take sovereignty from whoever You will. You exalt whoever You will You abase whoever You will. All good is in Your hands. You have power over all things"
  3,27,You merge the night into the day. You merge the day into the night. You bring out the living from the dead. You bring out the dead from the living. You provide for whoever You will without any reckoning.´
  3,28,The muminun should not take kafirun as friends rather than muminun. Anyone who does that has nothing to do with Allah at all — unless it is because you are afraid of them. Allah advises you to beware of Him. Allah is the final destination
  3,29,"Say, ´Whether you conceal what is in your breasts or make it known, Allah knows it. He knows what is in the heavens and what is on earth. Allah has power over all things.´"
