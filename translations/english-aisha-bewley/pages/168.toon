  7,146,"I will divert from My Signs all those who are arrogant in the earth without any right. If they see every Sign, they will not believe in it. If they see the way of right guidance, they will not take it as a way. But if they see the way of error, they will take that as a way. That is because they denied Our Signs and paid no attention to them"
  7,147,"As for those who denied Our Signs and the encounter of the Next World, their actions will come to nothing. Will they be repaid except for what they did"
  7,148,"After he left, Musa´s people adopted a calf made from their ornaments, a form which made a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could not speak to them or guide them to any way? They adopted it and so they were wrongdoers"
  7,149,"When they took full stock of what they had done and saw they had been misled, they said, ´If our Lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us, we will certainly be among the lost.´"
