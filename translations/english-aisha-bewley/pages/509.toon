quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"Those who have iman say, ´If only a sura could be sent down.´ But when a straightforward sura is sent down and fighting is mentioned in it, you see those with sickness in their hearts looking at you with the look of someone about to faint from fear of death. More fitting for them"
  47,21,"would be obedience and honourable words. Once the matter is resolved upon, being true to Allah would be better for them"
  47,22,"Is it not likely that, if you did turn away, you would cause corruption in the earth and sever your ties of kinship"
  47,23,"Such are the people Allah has cursed, making them deaf and blinding their eyes"
  47,24,Will they not then ponder the Qur´an or are there locks upon their hearts
  47,25,"Those who have turned back in their tracks after the guidance became clear to them, it was Shaytan who talked them into it and filled them with false hopes"
  47,26,"That is because they said to those who hate what Allah has sent down, ´We will obey you in part of the affair.´ But Allah knows their secrets"
  47,27,"How will it be when the angels take them in death, beating their faces and their backs"
  47,28,That is because they followed what angers Allah and hated what is pleasing to Him. So He made their actions come to nothing
  47,29,Or did those with sickness in their hearts imagine that Allah would not expose their malevolence
