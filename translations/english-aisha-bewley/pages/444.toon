  36,63,This is the Hell that you were promised
  36,64,Roast in it today because you were kafirun.´
  36,65,"Today We seal up their mouths and their hands speak to us, and their feet bear witness to what they have earned"
  36,66,"If We wished, We could put out their eyes. Then, though they might race for the path, how would they see"
  36,67,"If We wished, We could transform them where they stand so they would neither be able to go out nor return"

  36,69,We did not teach him poetry nor would it be right for him. It is simply a reminder and a clear Qur´an
