quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  42,32,Among His Signs are the tall ships sailing like mountains through the sea
  42,33,If He wills He makes the wind stop blowing and then they lie motionless on its back. There are certainly Signs in that for everyone who is steadfast and thankful
  42,34,Or He wrecks them for what they have earned though He pardons much
  42,35,Those who argue about Our Signs should know that they have no way of escape
  42,36,Whatever you have been given is only the enjoyment of the life of this world. What is with Allah is better and longer lasting for those who have iman and trust in their Lord
  42,37,"those who avoid major wrong actions and indecencies and who, when they are angered, then forgive"
  42,38,"those who respond to their Lord and establish salat, and manage their affairs by mutual consultation and give of what We have provided for them"
  42,39,"those who, when they are wronged, defend themselves"
  42,40,"The repayment of a bad action is one equivalent to it. But if someone pardons and puts things right, his reward is with Allah. Certainly He does not love wrongdoers"
  42,41,"But if people do defend themselves when they are wronged, nothing can be held against them for doing that"
  42,42,There are only grounds against those who wrong people and act as tyrants in the earth without any right to do so. Such people will have a painful punishment
  42,43,"But if someone is steadfast and forgives, that is the most resolute course to follow"
  42,44,"Whoever Allah misguides has no one to protect them after that. You will see the wrongdoers saying, when they see the punishment, ´Is there no way back?´"
