quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,they denied him and so they will be among those arraigned —
  37,128,except for Allah´s chosen slaves
  37,129,We left the later people saying of him
  37,130,´Peace be upon the family of Yasin!´
  37,131,That is how We recompense good-doers
  37,132,He truly was one of Our slaves who are muminun
  37,133,And Lut was one of the Messengers
  37,134,When We rescued him and all his family —
  37,135,except an old woman among those who stayed behind
  37,136,Then We utterly destroyed the rest
  37,137,And you pass by them in the daytime and at night
  37,138,So will you not use your intellect
  37,139,Yunus too was one of the Messengers
  37,140,When he ran away to the fully laden ship
  37,141,and cast lots and lost
  37,142,Then the fish devoured him and he was to blame
  37,143,Had it not been that he was a man who glorified Allah
  37,144,he would have remained inside its belly until the Day they are raised again
  37,145,So We cast him up onto the beach and he was sick
  37,146,and We caused a gourd tree to grow over him
  37,147,We sent him to a hundred thousand or even more
  37,148,They had iman and so We gave them enjoyment for a time
  37,149,"Ask them for a fatwa: does your Lord have daughters while they themselves have sons"
  37,150,"Or did We create the angels female, with them as witnesses"
  37,151,"No indeed, it is one of their blatant lies to say"
  37,152,´Allah has given birth´. They are truly liars
  37,153,Has He chosen daughters over sons
