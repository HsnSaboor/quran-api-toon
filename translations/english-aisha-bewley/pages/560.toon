quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  66,1,"O Prophet! Why do you make haram what Allah has made halal for you, seeking to please your wives? Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  66,2,"Allah has made the expiation of your oaths obligatory for you. Allah is your Master — He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise"
  66,3,"The Prophet confided a certain matter to one of his wives, then when she divulged it Allah disclosed that to him, and he communicated part of it and withheld part of it. When he told her of it, she said, ´Who told you of this?´ He said, ´The All-Knowing and All-Aware informed me of it.´"
  66,4,"If the two of you would only turn to Allah, for your hearts clearly deviated . . . But if you support one another against him, Allah is his Protector and so are Jibril and every right-acting man of the muminun and, furthermore, the angels too will come to his support"
  66,5,"It may be that if he does divorce you, his Lord will give him in exchange better wives than you: Muslim women, believing women, obedient women, penitent women, women who worship, women who fast much — previously married women as well as virgins"
  66,6,"You who have iman! safeguard yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones. Harsh, terrible angels are in charge of it who do not disobey Allah in respect of any order He gives them and carry out what they are ordered to do"
  66,7,´You who are kafir! do not try to excuse yourselves today. You are merely being repaid for what you did.´
