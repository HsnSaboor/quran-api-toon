  32,12,"If only you could see the evildoers hanging their heads in shame before their Lord: ´Our Lord, we have seen and we have heard, so send us back again and we will act rightly. Truly we now have certainty.´"
  32,13,"´Had We so willed We could have given guidance to everyone, but now My Words are shown to be true: that I shall fill up Hell entirely with jinn and human beings"
  32,14,"So taste it. Because you forgot the meeting of this Day, We have forgotten you. Taste the punishment of eternal timelessness for what you did.´"
  32,15,"The people who truly do have iman in Our Signs are those who fall to the ground prostrating when they are reminded of them, and glorify their Lord with praise, and are not arrogant"
  32,16,Their sides eschew their beds as they call on their Lord in fear and ardent hope. And they give of what We have provided for them
  32,17,No self knows the delight that is hidden away for it in recompense for what it used to do
  32,18,Is someone who has iman like someone who is a deviator? They are not the same
  32,19,"As for those who have iman and do right actions, they will have the Gardens of Safe Refuge as hospitality for what they used to do"
  32,20,"But as for those who are deviators, their refuge is the Fire. Every time that they want to get out, they are put straight back into it again and they are told, ´Taste the punishment of the Fire, which you denied.´"
