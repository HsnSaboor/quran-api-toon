quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  55,68,In them are fruits and date-palms and pomegranates
  55,69,So which of your Lord´s blessings do you both then deny
  55,70,"In them are sweet, lovely maidens"
  55,71,So which of your Lord´s blessings do you both then deny
  55,72,"Dark-eyed, secluded in cool pavilions"
  55,73,So which of your Lord´s blessings do you both then deny
  55,74,Untouched before them by either man or jinn
  55,75,So which of your Lord´s blessings do you both then deny
  55,76,Reclining on green quilts and exquisite rugs
  55,77,So which of your Lord´s blessings do you both then deny
  55,78,"Blessed be the name of your Lord, Master of Majesty and Generosity"
  56,1,When the Great Event occurs
  56,2,none will deny its occurrence
  56,3,"bringing low, raising high"
  56,4,When the earth is convulsed
  56,5,and the mountains are crushed
  56,6,and become scattered dust in the air
  56,7,And you will be classed into three
  56,8,"the Companions of the Right: what of the Companions of the Right"
  56,9,"the Companions of the Left: what of the Companions of the Left"
  56,10,"and the Forerunners, the Forerunners"
  56,11,Those are the Ones Brought Near
  56,12,in Gardens of Delight
  56,13,A large group of the earlier people
  56,14,but few of the later ones
  56,15,On sumptuous woven couches
  56,16,reclining on them face to face
