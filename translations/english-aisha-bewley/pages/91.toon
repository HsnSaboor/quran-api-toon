quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,80,"Whoever obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allah. If anyone turns away, We did not send you to them as their keeper"
  4,81,"They have the word, ´Obedience!´ on their tongues but when they leave your presence, a group of them spend the night plotting to do other than what you say. Allah is recording their nocturnal plotting. So let them be and put your trust in Allah. Allah suffices as a Guardian"
  4,82,"Will they not ponder the Qur´an? If it had been from other than Allah, they would have found many inconsistencies in it"
  4,83,"When news of any matter reaches them they spread it about, whether it is of a reassuring or disquieting nature. If they had only referred it to the Messenger and those in command among them, those among them able to discern the truth about it would have had proper knowledge of it. If it were not for Allah´s favour to you and His mercy, all but a very few of you would have followed Shaytan"
  4,84,So fight in the way of Allah — you are only answerable for yourself — and spur on the muminun. It may well be that Allah will curb the force of the kuffar. Allah has greater force and greater power to punish
  4,85,Those who join forces for good will receive a reward for it. Those who join forces for evil will be answerable for it. Allah gives all things what they deserve
  4,86,"When you are greeted with a greeting, return the greeting or improve on it. Allah takes account of everything"
