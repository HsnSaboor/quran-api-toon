quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,"on couches, gazing in wonder"
  83,36,Have the kuffar been rewarded for what they did
  84,1,When the sky bursts open
  84,2,hearkening to its Lord as it is bound to do
  84,3,When the earth is flattened out
  84,4,and disgorges what is inside it and empties out
  84,5,hearkening to its Lord as it is bound to do
  84,6,O Man! You are toiling laboriously towards your Lord but meet Him you will
  84,7,As for him who is given his Book in his right hand
  84,8,he will be given an easy reckoning
  84,9,and return to his family joyfully
  84,10,But as for him who is given his Book behind his back
  84,11,he will cry out for destruction
  84,12,but will be roasted in a Searing Blaze
  84,13,He used to be joyful in his family
  84,14,He thought that he was never going to return
  84,15,But in fact his Lord was always watching him
  84,16,"No, I swear by the evening glow"
  84,17,and the night and all it shrouds
  84,18,and the moon when it is full
  84,19,you will mount up stage by stage
  84,20,What is the matter with them that they have no iman
  84,21,"and, when the Qur´an is recited to them, do not prostrate"
  84,22,In fact those who are kafir say that it is lies
  84,23,But Allah knows best what they are storing in their hearts
  84,24,Give them the news of a painful punishment —
  84,25,"except those who have iman and do right actions: they will have a wage which never fails"
