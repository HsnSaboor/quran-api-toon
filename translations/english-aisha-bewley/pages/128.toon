quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,1,Praise belongs to Allah who created the heavens and the earth and appointed darkness and light. Then those who are kafir make others equal to their Lord
  6,2,"It is He who created you from clay and then decreed a fixed term, and another fixed term is specified with Him. Yet you still have doubts"
  6,3,He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth. He knows what you keep secret and what you make public and He knows what you earn
  6,4,Not one of their Lord´s Signs comes to them without their turning away from it
  6,5,They deny the truth each time it comes to them but news of what they were mocking will certainly reach them
  6,6,Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them which We had established on the earth far more firmly than We have established you? We sent down heaven upon them in abundant rain and made rivers flow under them. But We destroyed them for their wrong actions and raised up further generations after them
  6,7,"Even if We were to send down a book to you on parchment pages and they were actually to touch it with their own hands, those who are kafir would still say, ´This is nothing but downright magic.´"
  6,8,"They say, ´Why has an angel not been sent down to him?´ If We were to send down an angel, that would be the end of the affair and they would have no reprieve"
