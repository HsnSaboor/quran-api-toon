quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  13,29,"Those who have iman and do right actions, happiness will be theirs and a wonderful Homecoming"
  13,30,"In the same way We have sent you among a nation before which other nations passed away, to recite to them what We have revealed to you. Yet they still reject the All-Merciful. Say: ´He is my Lord; there is no god but Him. I put my trust in Him and I turn to Him.´"
  13,31,"Even if there was a Qur´an which moved mountains, or split the earth open or spoke to the dead . . .! On the contrary! The affair is Allah´s altogether. Do those who have iman not know that if Allah had wanted to He could have guided all mankind? Those who are kafir will not cease to be struck by disaster for what they have done — or a disaster will happen close to their homes — until Allah´s promise is fulfilled. Allah will not fail to keep His promise"
  13,32,Messengers before you were mocked. I gave those who were kafir a little more time and then I seized them. How terrible was My retribution
  13,33,"What then of Him who is standing over every self seeing everything it does? Yet still they associate others with Allah! Say: ´Name them! Or would you inform Him of something in the earth He does not know, or are they words which are simply guesswork on your part?´ However, the plotting of those who are kafir seems good to them and they bar the way. Anyone misguided by Allah has no guide"
  13,34,They will receive punishment in the life of this world and the punishment of the Next World is harsher still. They have no defender against Allah
