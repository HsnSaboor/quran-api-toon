quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  9,94,"They will make excuses to you when you return to them. Say: ´Do not make excuses, we will not believe you. Allah has already informed us about you. Allah will see your actions, as will His Messenger. Then you will be returned to the Knower of the Unseen and the Visible, and He will inform you regarding what you did.´"
  9,95,"They will swear to you by Allah when you return to them, so that you leave them alone. Leave them alone, then! They are filth. Their shelter will be Hell as repayment for what they did"
  9,96,"They will swear to you to make you pleased with them, but even if you are pleased with them, Allah is certainly not pleased with deviant people"
  9,97,"The desert arabs are more obdurate in kufr and hypocrisy and more likely not to know the limits which Allah has sent down to His Messenger. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  9,98,"Among the desert arabs there are some who regard what they give as an imposition and are waiting for your fortunes to change. The evil turn of fortune will be theirs! Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
  9,99,"And among the desert arabs there are some who have iman in Allah and the Last Day and regard what they give as something which will bring them nearer to Allah and to the prayers of the Messenger. It does indeed bring them near. Allah will admit them into His mercy. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
