quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,111,"Even if We sent down angels to them, and the dead spoke to them, and We gathered together everything in front of them right before their eyes, they would still not have iman unless Allah willed. The truth is that most of them are ignorant"
  6,112,"In this way We have appointed as enemies to every Prophet shaytans from both mankind and from the jinn, who inspire each other with delusions by means of specious words — if your Lord had willed, they would not have done it, so abandon them and all they fabricate —"
  6,113,so that the hearts of those who do not have iman in the akhira incline towards them and are pleased with them and perpetrate whatever they perpetrate
  6,114,"´Am I to desire someone other than Allah as a judge when it is He who has sent down the Book to you clarifying everything?´ Those We have given the Book know it has been sent down from your Lord with truth, so on no account be among the doubters"
  6,115,"The Words of your Lord are perfect in truthfulness and justice. No one can change His Words. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing"
  6,116,"If you obeyed most of those on earth, they would misguide you from Allah´s Way. They follow nothing but conjecture. They are only guessing"
  6,117,Your Lord knows best who is misguided from His Way and He knows best those who are guided
  6,118,"Eat that over which the name of Allah has been mentioned, if you have iman in His Signs"
