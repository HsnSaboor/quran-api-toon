quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,22,"When he turned his face in the direction of Madyan, he said, ´Hopefully my Lord will guide me to the right way.´"
  28,23,"When he arrived at the water of Madyan, he found a crowd of people drawing water there. Standing apart from them, he found two women, holding back their sheep. He said, ´What are you two doing here?´ They said, ´We cannot draw water until the shepherds have driven off their sheep. You see our father is a very old man.´"
  28,24,"So he drew water for them and then withdrew into the shade and said, ´My Lord, I am truly in need of any good You have in store for me.´"
  28,25,"One of them came walking shyly up to him and said, ´My father invites you so that he can pay you your wage for drawing water for us.´ When he came to him and told him the whole story he said, ´Have no fear, you have escaped from wrongdoing people.´"
  28,26,"One of them said, ´Hire him, father. The best person to hire is someone strong and trustworthy.´"
  28,27,"He said, ´I would like to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine on condition that you work for me for eight full years. If you complete ten, that is up to you. I do not want to be hard on you. You will find me, Allah willing, to be one of the salihun.´"
  28,28,"He said, ´That is agreed between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I fulfil, there should be no bad feeling towards me. Allah is Guardian over what we say.´"
