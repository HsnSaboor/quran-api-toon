  29,66,Let them be ungrateful for what We have given them! Let them enjoy themselves — they will soon know
  29,67,Do they not see that We have established a safe haven while people all round them are violently dispossessed? So why do they believe in falsehood and reject the blessing of Allah
  29,68,Who could do greater wrong than someone who invents lies against Allah or denies the truth when it comes to him? Is there not shelter in Hell for the kafirun
  29,69,"As for those who do jihad in Our Way, We will guide them to Our Paths. Truly Allah is with the good-doers"
