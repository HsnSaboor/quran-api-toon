quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"who would say to me, \"Are you one of those who say that it is true"
  37,53,"that when we have died and are turned to dust and bones, we will face a Reckoning?\"´"
  37,54,"He will say, ´Are you looking down?´"
  37,55,So he will look down and see him in the midst of the Blazing Fire
  37,56,"and say, ´By Allah, you almost ruined me"
  37,57,"If it were not for the blessing of my Lord, I would have been among those arraigned"
  37,58,Are we not going to die
  37,59,except for our first death? Are we not going to be punished
  37,60,Truly this is the Great Victory
  37,61,It is for the like of this that all workers should work!´
  37,62,Is that better by way of hospitality or the tree of Zaqqum
  37,63,which We have made to be an ordeal for the wrongdoers
  37,64,It is a tree that emerges in the depths of the Blazing Fire
  37,65,Its fruits are just like the heads of shaytans
  37,66,They will eat from it and fill their bellies with it
  37,67,Then they will have a boiling brew to drink on top of it
  37,68,Then their destination will be the Blazing Fire
  37,69,They found their fathers misguided
  37,70,and they are following hard upon their heels
  37,71,Most of the earlier peoples went astray before them
  37,72,though We sent warners to them
  37,73,See the final fate of those who were warned —
  37,74,except for Allah´s chosen slaves
  37,75,Nuh called out to Us and what an excellent Responder We are
  37,76,We rescued him and his family from the terrible plight
