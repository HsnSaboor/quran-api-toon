quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,17,"Be steadfast in the face of what they say and remember Our slave Dawud, who possessed true strength. He truly turned to his Lord"
  38,18,We subjected the mountains to glorify with him in the evening and at sunrise
  38,19,"And also the birds, flocking together, all of them turned to Him"
  38,20,We made his kingdom strong and gave him wisdom and decisive speech
  38,21,Has the story of the litigants reached you? How they climbed up to the Upper Room
  38,22,"and came in on Dawud who was alarmed by them. They said, ´Do not be afraid. We are two litigants, one of whom has acted unjustly towards the other, so judge between us with truth and do not be unjust and guide us to the Right Path"
  38,23,"This brother of mine has ninety-nine ewes and I have only one. He said, \"Let me have charge of it,\" and got the better of me with his words.´"
  38,24,"He said, ´He has wronged you by asking for your ewe to add to his ewes. Truly many partners are unjust to one another — except those who have iman and do right actions, and how few they are!´ Dawud realised that We had put him to the test. He begged forgiveness from his Lord and fell down prone, prostrating, and repented"
  38,25,So We forgave him for that and he has nearness to Us and a good Homecoming
  38,26,"´Dawud! We have made you a khalif on the earth, so judge between people with truth and do not follow your own desires, letting them misguide you from the Way of Allah. Those who are misguided from the Way of Allah will receive a harsh punishment because they forgot the Day of Reckoning.´"
