quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  64,1,Everything in the heavens and everything on earth glorifies Allah. Sovereignty and praise belong to Him. He has power over all things
  64,2,It is He who created you. Yet among you are those who are kafir and those who have iman. Allah sees what you do
  64,3,"He created the heavens and the earth with truth and formed you, giving you the best of forms. And He is your final destination"
  64,4,He knows everything in the heavens and earth. He knows what you keep secret and what you divulge. Allah knows what the heart contains
  64,5,Has the news not reached you of those who were kafir before and tasted the evil consequences of what they did? They will have a painful punishment
  64,6,"That is because their Messengers brought them the Clear Signs but they said, ´Are human beings going to guide us?´ So they were kafir and turned away. But Allah is completely independent of them. Allah is Rich Beyond Need, Praiseworthy"
  64,7,"Those who are kafir claim that they will never be raised again. Say: ´Oh yes, by my Lord, you certainly will be raised again! And then you will be informed about what you did. That is easy for Allah.´"
  64,8,So have iman in Allah and His Messenger and in the Light We have sent down. Allah is aware of what you do
  64,9,"On the Day He gathers you for the Day of Gathering — that is the Day of Profit and Loss. As for those who have iman in Allah and act rightly, We will erase their bad actions from them and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever and ever. That is the Great Victory"
