quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  28,51,We have conveyed the Word to them so that hopefully they will pay heed
  28,52,Those We gave the Book before this have iman in it
  28,53,"When it is recited to them they say, ´We have iman in it; it is the truth from our Lord. We were already Muslims before it came.´"
  28,54,They will be given their reward twice over because they have been steadfast and because they ward off the bad with the good and give from what we have provided for them
  28,55,"When they hear worthless talk they turn away from it and say, ´We have our actions and you have your actions. Peace be upon you. We do not desire the company of the ignorant.´"
  28,56,You cannot guide those you would like to but Allah guides those He wills. He has best knowledge of the guided
  28,57,"They say, ´If we follow the guidance with you, we shall be forcibly uprooted from our land.´ Have We not established a safe haven for them to which produce of every kind is brought, provision direct from Us? But most of them do not know it"
  28,58,"How many cities We have destroyed which lived in insolent ingratitude! There are their houses, never again inhabited after them, except a little. It was We who were their Heir"
  28,59,Your Lord would never destroy any cities without first sending to the chief of them a Messenger to recite Our Signs to them. We would never destroy any cities unless their inhabitants were wrongdoers
