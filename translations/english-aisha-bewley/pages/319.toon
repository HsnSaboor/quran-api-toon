quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  20,99,In this way We give you news of what has gone before and We have given you a reminder direct from Us
  20,100,Those who turn away from it will bear a heavy burden on the Day of Rising
  20,101,"remaining in it timelessly, for ever. What an evil load they will bear on the Day of Rising"
  20,102,On the Day the Trumpet is blown — and We will gather the evildoers sightless on that Day —
  20,103,"they will whisper secretly to one other, ´You only stayed for ten.´"
  20,104,"We know best what they will say when the most correct of them will say, ´You only stayed a day.´"
  20,105,"They will ask you about the mountains. Say: ´My Lord will scatter them as dust"
  20,106,"He will leave them as a barren, level plain"
  20,107,on which you will see no dip or gradient.´
  20,108,On that day they will follow the Summoner who has no crookedness in him at all. Voices will be humbled before the All-Merciful and nothing but a whisper will be heard
  20,109,On that Day intercession will not be of any use except for him whom the All-Merciful has authorised and with whose speech He is well-pleased
  20,110,He knows what is in front of them and behind them. But their knowledge does not encompass Him
  20,111,"Faces will be humbled to the Living, the All-Sustaining. and anyone weighed down with wrongdoing will have failed"
  20,112,"But anyone who does right actions, being a mumin, need fear no wrong or any belittlement"
  20,113,In this way We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur´an and We have made various threats in it so that hopefully they will have taqwa or it will spur them into remembrance
