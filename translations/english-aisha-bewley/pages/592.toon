quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,Yet still you prefer the life of the dunya
  87,17,when the akhira is better and longer lasting
  87,18,This is certainly in the earlier texts
  87,19,the texts of Ibrahim and Musa
  88,1,Has news of the Overwhelmer reached you
  88,2,Some faces on that Day will be downcast
  88,3,"labouring, toiling endlessly"
  88,4,roasting in a red-hot Fire
  88,5,drinking from a boiling spring
  88,6,They have no food but a bitter thorny bush
  88,7,which neither nourishes nor satisfies
  88,8,Some faces on that Day will be radiant
  88,9,well-pleased with their efforts
  88,10,in an elevated Garden
  88,11,where no prattle is ever heard
  88,12,In it is a gushing spring
  88,13,and raised-up couches
  88,14,and set-out goblets
  88,15,and lined-up cushions
  88,16,and spread-out rugs
  88,17,Have they not looked at the camel — how it was created
  88,18,and at the sky — how it was raised up
  88,19,and at the mountains — how they were embedded
  88,20,and at the earth — how it was smoothed out
  88,21,So remind them! You are only a reminder
  88,22,You are not in control of them
  88,23,But as for anyone who turns away and is kafir
  88,24,Allah will punish him with the Greatest Punishment
  88,25,Certainly it is to Us they will return
  88,26,Then their Reckoning is Our concern
