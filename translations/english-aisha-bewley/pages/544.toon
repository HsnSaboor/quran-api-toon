quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  58,12,"You who have iman! when you consult the Messenger privately precede your private consultation by giving sadaqa — that is better for you and purer. But if you cannot find the means, Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  58,13,"Are you afraid to give gifts of sadaqa before your private consultation? If you do not and Allah turns to you, at least establish salat and pay zakat, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah is aware of what you do"
  58,14,Do you not see those who have turned to people with whom Allah is angry? They belong neither to you nor to them. And they swear to falsehood and do so knowingly
  58,15,Allah has prepared a terrible punishment for them. How evil is what they have been doing
  58,16,"They made their oaths into a cloak and barred the Way of Allah, so they will have a humiliating punishment"
  58,17,"Neither their wealth nor their children will help them at all against Allah. Such people are the Companions of the Fire, remaining in it timelessly, for ever"
  58,18,On the Day Allah raises up all of them them together they will swear to Him just as they have sworn to you and imagine they have something to stand upon. No indeed! It is they who are the liars
  58,19,Shaytan has gained mastery over them and made them forget the remembrance of Allah. Such people are the party of Shaytan. No indeed! It is the party of Shaytan who are the losers
  58,20,"Those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, such people will be among the most abased"
  58,21,"Allah has written, ´I will be victorious, I and and My Messengers.´ Allah is Most Strong, Almighty"
