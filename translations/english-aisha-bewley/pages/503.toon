quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  46,6,"When mankind is gathered together, they will be their enemies and will reject their worship"
  46,7,"When Our Clear Signs are recited to them, those who reject say to the truth when it comes to them, ´This is downright magic.´"
  46,8,"Or do they say, ´He has invented it´? Say: ´If I have invented it, then you possess no power to help me against Allah in any way. He knows best what you hold forth about. He is witness enough between me and you. He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.´"
  46,9,"Say: ´I am nothing new among the Messengers. I have no idea what will be done with me or you. I only follow what has been revealed to me. I am only a clear warner.´"
  46,10,"Say: ´What do you think? If it is from Allah and you reject it, when a witness from the tribe of Israel testifies to its similarity and has iman while you are arrogant . . . ! Allah certainly does not guide wrongdoing people.´"
  46,11,"Those who are kafir say of those who have iman, ´If there was any good in it, they would not have beaten us to it.´ And since they have not been guided by it, they are bound to say, ´This is an antiquated falsehood.´"
  46,12,"But before it there was the Book of Musa as a model and a mercy. And this is a corroborating Book in the Arabic tongue so that you may warn those who do wrong, and as good news for the good-doers"
  46,13,"Those who say, ´Our Lord is Allah,´ and then go straight will feel no fear and will know no sorrow"
  46,14,"Such people are the Companions of the Garden, remaining in it timelessly, for ever, as repayment for what they did"
