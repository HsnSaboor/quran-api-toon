quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  57,12,"On the Day you see the men and women of the muminun, with their light streaming out in front of them, and to their right: ´Good news for you today of Gardens with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever. That is the Great Victory.´"
  57,13,"That Day the men and women of the hypocrites will say to those who have iman, ´Wait for us so that we can borrow some of your light.´ They will be told, ´Go back and look for light!´ And a wall will be erected between them with a gate in it, on the inside of which there will be mercy but before whose exterior lies the punishment"
  57,14,"They will call out to them, ´Were we not with you?´ They will reply, ´Indeed you were. But you made trouble for yourselves and hung back and and doubted and false hopes deluded you until Allah´s command arrived. The Deluder deluded you about Allah"
  57,15,So today no ransom will be accepted from you or from those who were kafir. Your refuge is the Fire. It is your master. What an evil destination!´
  57,16,"Has the time not arrived for the hearts of those who have iman to yield to the remembrance of Allah and to the truth He has sent down, so they are not like those who were given the Book before for whom the time seemed over long so that their hearts became hard? Many of them are deviators"
  57,17,Know that Allah brings the earth to life after it was dead. We have made the Signs clear to you so that hopefully you will use your intellect
  57,18,The men and women who give sadaqa and make a good loan to Allah will have it increased for them and they will have a generous reward
