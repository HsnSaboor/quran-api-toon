quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  56,51,"Then you, you misguided, you deniers"
  56,52,will eat from the tree of Zaqqum
  56,53,filling your stomachs with it
  56,54,and drink scalding water on top of it
  56,55,slurping like thirst-crazed camels
  56,56,This will be their hospitality on the Day of Judgment!´
  56,57,We created you so why do you not confirm the truth
  56,58,Have you thought about the sperm that you ejaculate
  56,59,Is it you who create it or are We the Creator
  56,60,We have decreed death for you and We will not be forestalled
  56,61,in replacing you with others the same as you and re-forming you in a way you know nothing about
  56,62,"You have known the first formation, so will you not pay heed"
  56,63,Have you thought about what you cultivate
  56,64,Is it you who make it germinate or are We the Germinator
  56,65,"If We wished We could have made it broken stubble. You would then be left devoid of crops, distraught"
  56,66,´We are ruined
  56,67,in fact we are destitute!´
  56,68,Have you thought about the water that you drink
  56,69,Is it you who sent it down from the clouds or are We the Sender
  56,70,"If We wished We could have made it bitter, so will you not give thanks"
  56,71,Have you thought about the fire that you light
  56,72,Is it you who make the trees that fuel it grow or are We the Grower
  56,73,We have made it to be a reminder and a comfort for travellers in the wild
  56,74,"So glorify the name of your Lord, the Magnificent"
  56,75,And I swear by the falling of the stars —
  56,76,and that is a mighty oath if you only knew —
