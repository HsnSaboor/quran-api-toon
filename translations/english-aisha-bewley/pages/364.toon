quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,44,Do you suppose that most of them hear or understand? They are just like cattle. Indeed they are even more astray
  25,45,Do you not see how your Lord stretches out shadows? If He had wished He could have made them stationary. Then We appoint the sun to be the pointer to them
  25,46,Then We draw them back to Ourselves in gradual steps
  25,47,"It is He who made the night a cloak for you and sleep a rest, and He made the day a time for rising"
  25,48,"It is He who sends out the winds, bringing advance news of His mercy. And We send down from heaven pure water"
  25,49,so that by it We can bring a dead land to life and give drink to many of the animals and people We created
  25,50,We have variegated it for them so they might pay heed but most people spurn anything else but kufr
  25,51,If We had wished We could have sent a warner to every town
  25,52,So do not obey the kafirun but use this to battle against them with all your might
  25,53,"It is He who has unloosed both seas — the one sweet and refreshing, the other salty and bitter — and put a dividing line between them, an uncrossable barrier"
  25,54,And it is He who created human beings from water and then gave them relations by blood and marriage. Your Lord is All-Powerful
  25,55,Yet they worship instead of Allah what can neither help nor harm them. The kuffar are always biased against their Lord
