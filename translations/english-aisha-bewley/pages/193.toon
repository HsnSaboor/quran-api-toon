quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  9,37,Deferring a sacred month is an increase in kufr by which the kuffar lead many people astray. One year they make it profane and another sacred to tally with the number Allah has made sacred. In that way they profane what Allah has made sacred. Their bad actions are made to seem good to them. Allah does not guide kafir people
  9,38,"You who have iman! what is the matter with you that when you are told, ´Go out and fight in the way of Allah,´ you sink down heavily to the earth? Are you happier with this world than the Next World? Yet the enjoyment of this world is very small compared to that of the Next World"
  9,39,"If you do not go out to fight, He will punish you with a painful punishment and substitute another people in your place. You will not harm Him in any way. Allah has power over all things"
  9,40,"If you do not help him, Allah did help him when the kuffar drove him out and there were two of them in the Cave.* He said to his companion, ´Do not be despondent, Allah is with us.´ Then Allah sent down His serenity upon him and reinforced him with troops you could not see. He made the word of the kuffar undermost. It is the word of Allah which is uppermost. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise"
