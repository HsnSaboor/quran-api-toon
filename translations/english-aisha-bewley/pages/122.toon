quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,83,"When they listen to what has been sent down to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they recognise of the truth. They say, ´Our Lord, we have iman! So write us down among the witnesses"
  5,84,"How could we not have iman in Allah, and the truth that has come to us, when we long for our Lord to include us among the righteous?´"
  5,85,"Allah will reward them for what they say with Gardens with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever. That is the recompense of the good-doers"
  5,86,"As for those who are kafir and deny Our Signs, they are the Companions of the Blazing Fire"
  5,87,"You who have iman! do not make haram the good things Allah has made halal for you, and do not overstep the limits. Allah does not love people who overstep the limits"
  5,88,"Eat the halal and good things Allah has provided for you, and have taqwa of Allah, Him in Whom you have iman"
  5,89,"Allah does not take you to task for your inadvertent oaths, but He will take you to task for oaths you make intentionally. The expiation in that case is to feed ten poor people with the average amount you feed your family, or clothe them, or free a slave. Anyone without the means to do so should fast three days. That is the expiation for breaking oaths when you have sworn them. Keep your oaths. In this way Allah makes His Signs clear to you, so that hopefully you will be thankful"
