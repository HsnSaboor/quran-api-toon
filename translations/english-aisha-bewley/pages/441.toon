quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  36,13,Make an example for them of the inhabitants of the city when the Messengers came to it
  36,14,"When We sent them two and they denied them both, so We reinforced them with a third. They said, ´Truly We have been sent to you as Messengers.´"
  36,15,"They said, ´You are nothing but human beings like ourselves. The All-Merciful has not sent down anything. You are simply lying.´"
  36,16,"They said, ´Our Lord knows we have been sent as Messengers to you"
  36,17,We are only responsible for clear transmission.´
  36,18,"They said, ´We see an evil omen in you. If you do not stop we will stone you and you will suffer a painful punishment at our hands.´"
  36,19,"They said, ´Your evil omen is in yourselves. Is it not just that you have been reminded? No, you are an unbridled people!´"
  36,20,"A man came running from the far side of the city, saying, ´My people! follow the Messengers"
  36,21,Follow those who do not ask you for any wage and who have received guidance
  36,22,"Why indeed should I not worship Him Who brought me into being, Him to Whom you will be returned"
  36,23,"Am I to take as gods instead of Him those whose intercession, if the All-Merciful desires harm for me, will not help me at all and cannot save me"
  36,24,In that case I would clearly be misguided
  36,25,I have iman in your Lord so listen to me!´
  36,26,"He was told, ´Enter the Garden!´ He said, ´If my people only knew"
  36,27,how my Lord has forgiven me and placed me among the honoured ones!´
