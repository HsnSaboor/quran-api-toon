  6,11,"Say: ´Travel about the earth and see the final fate of the deniers.´"
  6,12,"Say: ´To whom does everything in the heavens and earth belong?´ Say: ´To Allah.´ He has made mercy incumbent on Himself. He will gather you to the Day of Rising about which there is no doubt. As for those who have lost their own selves, they have no iman"
  6,13,"All that inhabits the night and the day belongs to Him. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing"
