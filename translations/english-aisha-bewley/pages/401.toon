  29,39,"And Qarun and Pharaoh and Haman — Musa came with the Clear Signs to them, but they were arrogant on the earth. They could not outstrip Us"
  29,40,We seized each one of them for their wrong actions. Against some We sent a sudden squall of stones; some of them were seized by the Great Blast; some We caused the earth to swallow up; and some We drowned. Allah did not wrong them; rather they wronged themselves

  29,42,"Allah knows what you call upon besides Himself. He is the Almighty, the All-Wise"
  29,43,Such metaphors — We devise them for mankind; but only those with knowledge understand them
  29,44,Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth. There is certainly a Sign in that for the muminun
  29,45,Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book and establish salat. Salat precludes indecency and wrongdoing. And remembrance of Allah is greater still. Allah knows what you do
