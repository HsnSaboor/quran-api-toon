quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  45,23,"Have you seen him who takes his whims and desires to be his god — whom Allah has misguided knowingly, sealing up his hearing and his heart and placing a blindfold over his eyes? Who then will guide him after Allah? So will you not pay heed"
  45,24,"They say, ´There is nothing but our existence in this world. We die and we live and nothing destroys us except for time.´ They have no knowledge of that. They are only conjecturing"
  45,25,"When Our Clear Signs are recited to them their only argument is to say, ´Bring us our fathers if you are telling the truth.´"
  45,26,"Say: ´Allah gives you life, then causes you to die, and then will gather you together for the Day of Rising about which there is no doubt. But most people do not know it.´"
  45,27,"The kingdom of the heavens and earth belongs to Allah and, on the Day that the Hour arrives, that Day the liars will be lost"
  45,28,"You will see every nation on its knees, every nation summoned to its Book: ´Today you will be repaid for what you did"
  45,29,This is Our Book speaking against you with the truth. We have been recording everything you did.´
  45,30,"As for those who had iman and did right actions, their Lord will admit them into His mercy. That is the Clear Victory"
  45,31,"But as for those who were kafir: ´Were My Signs not recited to you and yet you proved arrogant; you were a people of evildoers"
  45,32,"When you were told, \"Allah´s promise is true and so is the Hour, of which there is no doubt,\" you said, \"We have no idea what the Hour is. We have only been conjecturing. We are by no means certain.\"´"
