quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,80,Allah has made your houses places of rest for you and made houses for you out of cattle hides which are light for you to carry both when you are travelling and when you are staying in one place. And from their wool and fur and hair you obtain clothing and carpets and household utensils for a time
  16,81,Allah has made shaded places for you in what He has created and He has made shelters for you in the mountains and He has made shirts for you to protect you from the heat and shirts to protect you from each other´s violence. In that way He perfects His blessing on you so that hopefully you will become Muslims
  16,82,"But if they turn their backs, you are only responsible for clear transmission"
  16,83,They acknowledge Allah´s blessing and then deny it. Most of them are kuffar
  16,84,"On the Day We raise up a witness from every nation, those who were kafir will not be excused nor will they be able to appease Allah"
  16,85,"When those who did wrong see the punishment, it will not be lightened for them. They will be granted no reprieve"
  16,86,"When those who associated others with Allah see those they associated, they will say, ´Our Lord, these are our partner gods, the ones we called upon apart from You.´ But they will fling their words back in their faces: ´You are truly liars!´"
  16,87,On that Day they will offer their submission to Allah and the things they invented will abandon them
