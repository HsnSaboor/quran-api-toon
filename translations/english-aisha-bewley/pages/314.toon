quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  20,38,when We revealed to your mother
  20,39,"Place him into the box and throw it into the sea and the sea will wash it up on the shore, where an enemy of Mine and his will pick it up.\" I showered you with love from Me so that you would be brought up under My supervision"
  20,40,"When your sister went and said, \"Shall I direct you to someone who will take care of him?\" that was how We returned you to your mother so that she might delight her eyes and not be grieved. You killed a man and We rescued you from trouble and tested you with many trials. You stayed some years among the people of Madyan. Then you arrived at the pre-ordained time, Musa"
  20,41,I have chosen you for Myself
  20,42,"Go, you and your brother, with My Signs and do not slacken in remembering Me"
  20,43,Go to Pharaoh; he has overstepped the bounds
  20,44,But speak to him with gentle words so that hopefully he will pay heed or show some fear.´
  20,45,"They said, ´Our Lord, we are afraid that he might persecute us or overstep the bounds.´"
  20,46,"He said, ´Have no fear. I will be with you, All-Hearing and All-Seeing"
  20,47,"Go to him and say, \"We are your Lord´s Messengers so send the tribe of Israel away with us and do not punish them. We have brought you a Sign from your Lord. Peace be upon those who follow the guidance"
  20,48,"It has been revealed to us that punishment is for him who denies the truth and turns away.\"´"
  20,49,"Pharaoh said, ´Who then is your Lord, Musa?´"
  20,50,"He said, ´Our Lord is He who gives each thing its created form and then guides it.´"
  20,51,"He said, ´What about the previous generations?´"
