quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the fig and the olive
  95,2,and Mount Sinai
  95,3,and this safe land
  95,4,We created man in the finest mould
  95,5,Then We reduced him to the lowest of the low
  95,6,"except for those who have iman and do right actions: they will have a wage which never fails"
  95,7,What could make you deny the Reckoning after this
  95,8,Is Allah not the Justest of Judges
  96,1,"Recite: In the Name of your Lord who created"
  96,2,created man from clots of blood
  96,3,"Recite: And your Lord is the Most Generous"
  96,4,He who taught by the pen
  96,5,taught man what he did not know
  96,6,No indeed! Truly man is unbridled
  96,7,seeing himself as self-sufficient
  96,8,Truly it is to your Lord that you will return
  96,9,Have you seen him who prevents
  96,10,a slave when he goes to pray
  96,11,Do you think he is rightly guided
  96,12,or commands taqwa
  96,13,Or do you see how he has denied and turned away
  96,14,Does he not know that Allah sees
  96,15,"No indeed! If he does not desist, We will grab him by the forelock"
  96,16,"a lying, sinful forelock"
  96,17,Let him call his attendants
  96,18,We will call the Guards of Hell
  96,19,"No indeed! Do not obey him, but prostrate and draw near"
