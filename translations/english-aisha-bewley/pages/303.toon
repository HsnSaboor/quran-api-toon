quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  18,84,We gave him power and authority on the earth and granted him a way to everything
  18,85,So he followed a way
  18,86,"until he reached the setting of the sun and found it setting in a muddy spring and found a people by it. We said, ´Dhu´l-Qarnayn! You can either punish them or else you can treat them with gentleness.´"
  18,87,"He said, ´As for those who do wrong, we will punish them and then they will be returned to their Lord and He will punish them with a dreadful punishment"
  18,88,"But as for him who has iman and acts rightly, he will receive the best of rewards and we will issue a command, making things easy for him.´"
  18,89,Then he followed a way
  18,90,until he reached the rising of the sun and found it rising on a people to whom We had not given any shelter from it
  18,91,Our knowledge encompasses all that happened to him
  18,92,Then he followed a path
  18,93,until he arrived between the two mountains where he found a people scarcely able to understand speech
  18,94,"They said, ´Dhu´l-Qarnayn! Yajuj and Majuj are causing corruption in the land. Can we, therefore, pay tribute to you in return for your constructing a barrier between us and them?´"
  18,95,"He said, ´The power my Lord has granted me is better than that. Just give me a strong helping hand and I will build a solid barrier between you and them"
  18,96,"Bring me ingots of iron!´ Then, when he had made it level between the two high mountain-sides, he said,´Blow!´ and when he had made it a red hot fire, he said, ´Bring me molten brass to pour over it.´"
  18,97,"They were, therefore, unable to climb over it nor were they able to make a breach in it"
