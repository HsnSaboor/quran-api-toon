quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  13,6,They want you to hasten the bad rather than the good when examples of punishment are there before them in the past. Your Lord has forgiveness for people for their wrongdoing; but your Lord is also severe in retribution
  13,7,"Those who are kafir say, ´If only a Sign could be sent down to him from his Lord!´ You are only a warner. Every people has a guide"
  13,8,Allah knows what every female bears and every shrinking of the womb and every swelling. Everything has its measure with Him
  13,9,"the Knower of the Unseen and the Visible, the Most Great, the High-Exalted"
  13,10,"It makes no difference whether you keep secret what you say or voice it out loud, whether you hide in the night or go out in the day"
  13,11,"Everyone has a succession of angels in front of him and behind him, guarding him by Allah´s command. Allah never changes a people´s state until they change what is in themselves. When Allah desires evil for a people, there is no averting it. They have no protector apart from Him"
  13,12,"It is He Who shows you the lightning, striking fear and bringing hope; it is He Who heaps up the heavy clouds"
  13,13,"The thunder glorifies His praise, as do the angels, out of fear of Him. He discharges the thunderbolts, striking with them anyone He wills. Yet still they argue about Allah when He is inexorable in His power"
