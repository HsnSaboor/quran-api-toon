  21,13,"´Do not run away! Return to the life of luxury you enjoyed and to the places where you lived, so that you can be interrogated!´"
  21,14,"They said, ´Alas for us! We were indeed wrongdoers!´"
  21,15,"That cry of theirs went on until We made them stubble, silent, stamped out"
  21,16,We did not create heaven and earth and everything in between them as a game
  21,17,"If We had desired to have some amusement, We would have derived it from Our Presence, but We did not do that"
  21,18,Rather We hurl the truth against falsehood and it cuts right through it and it vanishes clean away! Woe without end for you for what you portray
  21,19,Everyone in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. Those in His presence do not consider themselves too great to worship Him and do not grow tired of it

  21,21,Or have they taken gods out of the earth who can bring the dead to life
  21,22,"If there had been any gods besides Allah in heaven or earth, they would both be ruined. Glory be to Allah, Lord of the Throne, beyond what they describe"

  21,24,"Or have they taken other gods besides Him? Say: ´Produce your proof! This is the message of those with me and the message of those before me.´ But most of them do not know the truth, so they turn away"
