quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  8,34,But why should Allah not punish them now when they bar access to the Masjid al-Haram? They are not its guardians. Only people who have taqwa can be its guardians. But most of them do not know that
  8,35,Their prayer at the House is nothing but whistling and clapping. So taste the punishment because you were kafir
  8,36,Those who are kafir spend their wealth barring access to the Way of Allah. They will spend it; then they will regret it; then they will be overthrown. Those who are kafir will be gathered into Hell
  8,37,"so that Allah can sift the bad out from the good, and pile the bad on top of one another, heaping them all together, and tip them into Hell. They are the lost"
  8,38,"Say to those who are kafir that if they stop, they will be forgiven what is past; but if they return to it, they have the pattern of previous peoples in the past"
  8,39,"Fight them until there is no more fitna and the deen is Allah´s alone. If they stop, Allah sees what they do"
  8,40,"but if they turn away, know that Allah is your Master, the Best of Masters, and the Best of Helpers"
