  34,40,"On the Day We gather them all together and then say to the angels, ´Was it you whom these people were worshipping?´"
  34,41,"they will say, ´Glory be to You! You are our Protector, not them. No, they were worshipping the jinn. They mostly had faith in them.´"

  34,43,"When Our Clear Signs are recited to them, they say, ´This is nothing but a man who wants to debar you from what your fathers used to worship.´ They say, ´This is nothing but an invented lie.´ Those who are kafir say to the truth when it comes to them, ´This is nothing but downright magic.´"
  34,44,"We have not given them any books which they are studying nor did We send, before you, any warner to them"

  34,46,"Say: ´I exhort you to do one thing alone: to stand before Allah in pairs and on your own and then reflect. Your companion is not possessed. He is only a warner come to you ahead of a terrible punishment.´"
  34,47,"Say: ´I have not asked you for any wage — it is all for you. My wage is the responsibility of Allah alone. He is witness of everything.´"
  34,48,"Say: ´My Lord hurls forth the Truth — the Knower of all unseen things.´"
