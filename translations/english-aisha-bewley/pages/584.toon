quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,when his Lord called out to him in the holy valley of Tuwa
  79,17,´Go to Pharaoh — he has overstepped the limits —
  79,18,"and say: \"Do you resolve to purify yourself"
  79,19,"I will guide you to your Lord so that you may fear Him?\"´"
  79,20,Then he showed him the Great Sign
  79,21,But he denied it and disobeyed
  79,22,and then he hastily backed away
  79,23,But then he rallied and called out
  79,24,"saying, ´I am your Lord Most High!´"
  79,25,So Allah made an example of him seizing him with punishment in the next World and this world
  79,26,There is certainly instruction in that for those who fear
  79,27,Are you stronger in structure or is heaven? He built it
  79,28,He raised its vault high and made it level
  79,29,He darkened its night and brought forth its morning light
  79,30,After that He smoothed out the earth
  79,31,and brought forth from it its water and its pastureland
  79,32,and made the mountains firm
  79,33,for you and for your livestock to enjoy
  79,34,When the Great Calamity comes
  79,35,that Day man will remember what he has striven for
  79,36,and the Blazing Fire will be displayed for all who can see
  79,37,As for him who overstepped the bounds
  79,38,and preferred the life of this world
  79,39,the Blazing Fire will be his refuge
  79,40,But as for him who feared the Station of his Lord and forbade the lower self its appetites
  79,41,the Garden will be his refuge
  79,42,"They ask you about the Hour: ´When will it come?´"
  79,43,What are you doing mentioning it
  79,44,Its coming is your Lord´s affair
  79,45,You are only the warner of those who fear it
  79,46,"On the Day they see it, it will be as if they had only lingered for the evening or the morning of a single day"
