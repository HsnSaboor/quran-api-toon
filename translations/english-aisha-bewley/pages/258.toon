  14,21,"They will all parade before Allah and the weak will say to those who were arrogant, ´We followed you, so can you help us at all against the punishment of Allah?´ They will say, ´If Allah had guided us, we would have guided you. It makes no difference whether we cannot stand it or bear it patiently. We have no way of escape.´"
  14,22,"When the affair is decided Shaytan will say, ´Allah made you a promise, a promise of truth, and I made you a promise but broke my promise. I had no authority over you, except that I called you and you responded to me. Do not, therefore, blame me but blame yourselves. I cannot come to your aid nor you to mine. I reject the way you associated me with Allah before.´ The wrongdoers will have a painful punishment"
  14,23,"Those who had iman and did right actions will be admitted into Gardens with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever by the permission of their Lord. Their greeting there is ´Peace!´"
  14,24,"Do you do not see how Allah makes a metaphor of a good word: a good tree whose roots are firm and whose branches are in heaven? It bears fruit regularly by its Lord´s permission. Allah makes metaphors for people so that hopefully they will pay heed"
