quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,59,"Nothing has prevented Us sending you Signs except the fact that the previous peoples denied them. We gave Thamud the she-camel as a visible Sign, and then they mistreated her. We do not send Signs except to frighten people"
  17,60,"When We said to you, ´Surely your Lord encompasses the people with His knowledge.´ We only appointed the vision We showed you and the Accursed Tree in the Qur´an as a trial and temptation for the people. We frighten them, but it only increases them in their excessive insolence"
  17,61,"When We said to the angels, ´Prostrate yourselves to Adam!´ they prostrated, except for Iblis. He said ´What! Am I to prostrate to one You have created out of clay?´"
  17,62,"He said, ´Do You see this creature You have honoured over me? If You reprieve me till the Day of Rising, I will be the master of his descendants except for a very few.´"
  17,63,"He said, ´Go! And as for any who follow you, your repayment is Hell, repayment in full"
  17,64,Stir up any of them you can with your voice and rally against them your cavalry and your infantry and share with them in their children and their wealth and make them promises! The promise of Shaytan is nothing but delusion
  17,65,"But as for My slaves, you will not have any authority over them.´ Your Lord suffices as a guardian"
  17,66,Your Lord is He who propels the ships on the sea for you so that you may seek His bounty. He is indeed Most Merciful to you
