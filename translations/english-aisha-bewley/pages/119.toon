quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,65,"If only the People of the Book had had iman and taqwa, We would have erased their evil deeds from them and admitted them into Gardens of Delight"
  5,66,"If only they had implemented the Torah and the Injil and what was sent down to them from their Lord, they would have been fed from above their heads and beneath their feet. Among them there is a moderate group but what most of them do is evil"
  5,67,O Messenger! transmit what has been sent down to you from your Lord. If you do not do it you will not have transmitted His Message. Allah will protect you from people. Allah does not guide the people of the kafirun
  5,68,"Say: ´People of the Book! you have nothing to stand on until you implement the Torah and the Gospel and what has been sent down to you from your Lord.´ What has been sent down to you from your Lord increases many of them in insolence and kufr. So do not waste your grief on the people of the kafirun"
  5,69,"Those who have iman and those who are Jews and the Sabaeans and the Christians, all who have iman in Allah and the Last Day and act rightly will feel no fear and will know no sorrow"
  5,70,"We made a covenant with the tribe of Israel and We sent Messengers to them. Each time a Messenger came to them with something their lower selves did not desire, they denied some and they murdered others"
