quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the dawn
  89,2,and ten nights
  89,3,and the even and odd
  89,4,and the night when it travels on
  89,5,is there not in that an oath for the intelligent
  89,6,Do you not see what your Lord did with ´Ad —
  89,7,Iram of the Columns
  89,8,whose like was not created in any land —
  89,9,and Thamud who carved out rocks in the valley-side
  89,10,and Pharaoh of the Stakes
  89,11,all of whom were tyrants in their lands
  89,12,and caused much corruption in them
  89,13,So your Lord unleashed on them a scourging punishment
  89,14,your Lord is always lying in wait
  89,15,"As for man, when his Lord tests him by honouring him and favouring him, he says, ´My Lord has honoured me!´"
  89,16,"But then when He tests him by restricting his provision, he says, ´My Lord has humiliated me!´"
  89,17,No indeed! You do not honour orphans
  89,18,nor do you urge the feeding of the poor
  89,19,you devour inheritance with voracious appetites
  89,20,and you have an insatiable love of wealth
  89,21,No indeed! When the earth is crushed and ground to dust
  89,22,and your Lord arrives with the angels rank upon rank
  89,23,"and that Day Hell is produced, that Day man will remember; but how will the remembrance help him"
