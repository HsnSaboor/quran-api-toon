quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"When they are told, ´Come, and the Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for you,´ they turn their heads and you see them turn away in haughty arrogance"
  63,6,In their case it makes no difference whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them. Allah will never forgive them. Allah does not guide deviant people
  63,7,"They are the people who say, ´Do not spend on those who are with the Messenger of Allah, so that they may go away.´ The treasuries of the heavens and earth belong to Allah. But the hypocrites do not understand this"
  63,8,"They say, ´If we return to Madina, the mightier will drive out the inferior.´ But all might belongs to Allah and to His Messenger and the muminun. But the hypocrites do not know this"
  63,9,You who have iman! do not let your wealth or children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. Whoever does that is lost
  63,10,"Give from what We have provided for you before death comes to one of you and he says, ´My Lord, if only you would give me a little more time so that I can give sadaqa and be one of the righteous!´"
  63,11,"Allah will not give anyone more time, once their time has come. Allah is aware of what you do"
