quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,41,"Go out to fight, whatever your circumstances or desires, and do jihad with your wealth and yourselves in the Way of Allah. That is better for you if you only knew"
  9,42,"If it had been a case of easy gains and a short journey, they would have followed you, but the distance was too great for them. They will swear by Allah: ´Had we been able to, we would have gone out with you.´ They are destroying their own selves. Allah knows that they are lying"
  9,43,Allah pardon you! Why did you excuse them until it was clear to you which of them were telling the truth and until you knew the liars
  9,44,Those who have iman in Allah and the Last Day do not ask you to excuse them from doing jihad with their wealth and themselves. Allah knows the people who have taqwa
  9,45,Only those who do not have iman in Allah and the Last Day ask you to excuse them. Their hearts are full of doubt and in their doubt they waver to and fro
  9,46,"If they had really desired to go out, they would have made proper preparations for it, but Allah was averse to their setting out so He held them back and they were told: ´Stay behind with those who stay behind.´"
  9,47,"If they had gone out among you, they would have added nothing to you but confusion. They would have scurried about amongst you seeking to cause conflict between you, and among you there are some who would have listened to them. Allah knows the wrongdoers"
