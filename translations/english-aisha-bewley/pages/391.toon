quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,44,You were not on the western side when We gave Musa the command. You were not a witness
  28,45,"Yet We produced further generations and ages passed. Nor did you live among the people of Madyan and recite Our Signs to them, yet We have sent you news of them"
  28,46,"Nor were you on the side of the Mount when We called, yet it is a mercy from your Lord so that you can warn a people to whom no warner came before, so that hopefully they will pay heed"
  28,47,"If a disaster had struck them because of what they had already done, they would have said, ´Our Lord, why did You not send us a Messenger so that we could have followed Your Signs and been muminun?´"
  28,48,"But when the truth did come to them from Us they said, ´Why has he not been given the same as Musa was given?´ But did they not previously reject what Musa was given? They say, ´Two magicians who back each other up.´ And they say, ´We reject both of them.´"
  28,49,"Say: ´Bring a Book, then, from Allah which guides better than both of them and follow it if you are telling the truth.´"
  28,50,If they do not respond to you then know that they are merely following their whims and desires. And who could be further astray than someone who follows his whims and desires without any guidance from Allah? Allah does not guide the people of the wrongdoers
