quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"As for those who are kafir and bar others from the Way of Allah, Allah will make their actions go astray"
  47,2,But as for those who have iman and do right actions and have iman in what has been sent down to Muhammad — and it is the truth from their Lord — He will erase their bad actions from them and better their condition
  47,3,That is because those who are kafir follow falsehood whereas those who have iman follow the truth from their Lord. In that way Allah makes comparisons for mankind
  47,4,"Therefore when you meet those who are kafir strike their necks. Then when you have decimated them, tie their bonds tightly and set them free or ransom them, until the war is finally over. That is how it is to be. If Allah willed, He could avenge Himself on them. But it is so that He can test some of you by means of others. As for those who fight in the Way of Allah, He will not let their actions go astray"
  47,5,He will guide them and better their condition
  47,6,and He will admit them into the Garden which He has made known to them
  47,7,"You who have iman! if you help Allah, He will help you and make your feet firm"
  47,8,But those who are kafir will have utter ruin and He will make their actions go astray
  47,9,"That is because they hate what Allah has sent down, so He has made their actions come to nothing"
  47,10,Have they not travelled about the earth and seen the final fate of those before them? Allah destroyed them utterly. And those who are kafir will suffer the same fate
  47,11,That is because Allah is the Protector of those who have iman and because those who are kafir have no protector
