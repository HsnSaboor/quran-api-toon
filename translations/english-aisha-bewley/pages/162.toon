quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,88,"The ruling circle of those of his people who were arrogant said, ´We will drive you out of our city, Shu´ayb, you and those who have iman along with you, unless you return to our religion.´ He said, ´What, even though we detest it"
  7,89,"We would be inventing lies against Allah if we returned to your religion after Allah has saved us from it. We could never return to it unless Allah our Lord so willed. Our Lord encompasses everything in His knowledge. We have put our trust in Allah. Our Lord, judge between us and our people with truth. You are the best of judges.´"
  7,90,"The ruling circle of those of his people who were kafir said, ´If you follow Shu´ayb, you will definitely be lost.´"
  7,91,So the earthquake seized them and morning found them lying flattened in their homes
  7,92,"As for those who denied Shu´ayb, it was as if they had never lived there. It was the people who denied Shu´ayb who were the lost"
  7,93,"So he turned away from them and said, ´My people, I transmitted My Lord´s message to you and gave you good counsel. Why should I grieve for a kafir people?´"
  7,94,We have never sent a Prophet to any city without seizing its people with hardship and distress so that hopefully they would be humble
  7,95,"Then We gave them good in exchange for evil until they increased in number and said, ´Our forefathers too underwent both hardship and ease.´ Then We seized them suddenly when they were not expecting it"
