quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  35,19,The blind and seeing are not the same
  35,20,nor are darkness and light
  35,21,nor are cool shade and fierce heat
  35,22,The living and dead are not the same. Allah makes anyone He wills hear but you cannot make those in the grave hear
  35,23,You are only a warner
  35,24,We have sent you with the truth bringing good news and giving warning. There is no community to which a warner has not come
  35,25,"If they deny you, those before them also denied the truth. Their Messengers came to them with Clear Signs, and psalms and the Illuminating Book"
  35,26,Then I seized hold of those who were kafir and how absolute was My rejection
  35,27,"Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the sky and by it We bring forth fruits of varying colours? And in the mountains there are streaks of white and red, of varying shades, and rocks of deep jet black"
  35,28,"And mankind and beasts and livestock are likewise of varying colours. Only those of His slaves with knowledge have fear of Allah. Allah is Almighty, Ever-Forgiving"
  35,29,"Those who recite the Book of Allah and establish salat and give of what We have provided for them, secretly and openly, hope for a transaction which will not prove profitless"
  35,30,"that He will pay them their wages in full and give them more from His unbounded favour. He is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Thankful"
