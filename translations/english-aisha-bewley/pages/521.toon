quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  51,7,By Heaven with its oscillating orbits
  51,8,you certainly have differing beliefs
  51,9,Averted from it is he who is averted
  51,10,Death to the conjecturers
  51,11,those who flounder in a glut of ignorance
  51,12,"asking, ´When is the Day of Judgement?´"
  51,13,On the Day they are tormented by the Fire
  51,14,´Taste your torment! This is what you were trying to hasten!´
  51,15,The people with taqwa will be among Gardens and Fountains
  51,16,receiving what their Lord has given them. Certainly before that they were good-doers
  51,17,The part of the night they spent asleep was small
  51,18,and they would seek forgiveness before the dawn
  51,19,And beggars and the destitute received a due share of their wealth
  51,20,There are certainly Signs in the earth for people with certainty
  51,21,and in yourselves as well. Do you not then see
  51,22,Your provision is in heaven — and what you are promised
  51,23,"By the Lord of heaven and earth, it is certainly the truth, just as you have speech"
  51,24,Has the story reached you of the honoured guests of Ibrahim
  51,25,"When they entered his dwelling and said, ´Peace!´ he said, ´Peace, to people we do not know.´"
  51,26,So he slipped off to his household and brought a fattened calf
  51,27,"He offered it to them and then exclaimed, ´Do you not then eat?´"
  51,28,"He felt afraid of them but they said, ´Do not be afraid!´ and gave him the good news of a son imbued with knowledge"
  51,29,"His wife came up with a shriek and struck her face and said, ´What, and me a barren old woman!´"
  51,30,"They said, ´That is what your Lord says. He is the All-Wise, the All-Knowing.´"
