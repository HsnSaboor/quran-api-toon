  9,49,"Among them are there some who say, ´Give me permission to stay. Do not put temptation in my way.´ Have they not fallen into that very temptation? Hell hems in the kafirun"
  9,50,"If good happens to you it galls them. If a mishap occurs to you, they say, ´We made our preparations in advance,´ and they turn away rejoicing"
  9,51,"Say: ´Nothing can happen to us except what Allah has ordained for us. He is Our Master. It is in Allah that the muminun should put their trust.´"
