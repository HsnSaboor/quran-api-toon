quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,260,"When Ibrahim said, ´My Lord, show me how You bring the dead to life.´ He asked, ´Do you not then have iman?´ He replied, ´Indeed I do! But so that my heart may be at peace.´ He said, ´Take four birds and train them to yourself. Then put a part of them on each mountain and call to them; they will come rushing to you. Know that Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.´"
  2,261,"The metaphor of those who spend their wealth in the Way of Allah is that of a grain which produces seven ears; in every ear there are a hundred grains. Allah gives such multiplied increase to whomever He wills. Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing"
  2,262,"Those who spend their wealth in the Way of Allah, and then do not follow what they have spent by demands for gratitude or insulting words will have their reward with their Lord. They will feel no fear and will know no sorrow"
  2,263,"Correct and courteous words accompanied by forgiveness are better than sadaqa followed by insulting words. Allah is Rich Beyond Need, All-Forbearing"
  2,264,"You who have iman! do not nullify your sadaqa by demands for gratitude or insulting words, like him who spends his wealth, showing off to people and not having iman in Allah and the Last Day. His likeness is that of a smooth rock coated with soil, which, when heavy rain falls on it, is left stripped bare. They have no power over anything they have earned. Allah does not guide kafir people"
