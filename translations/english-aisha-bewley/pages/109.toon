quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  5,10,"But those who are kafir and deny Our Signs, are the Companions of the Blazing Fire"
  5,11,You who have iman! remember Allah´s blessing to you when certain people were on the verge of raising their hands against you and He held their hands back from you. Have taqwa of Allah. The muminun should put their trust in Allah
  5,12,"Allah made a covenant with the tribe of Israel and We raised up twelve leaders from among them. Allah said, ´I am with you. If you establish salat and pay zakat, and have iman in My Messengers and respect and support them, and make a generous loan to Allah, I will erase your wrong actions from you and admit you into Gardens with rivers flowing under them. Any of you who are kafir after that have gone astray from the right way.´"
  5,13,"But because of their breaking of their covenant, We have cursed them and made their hearts hard. They distort the true meaning of words and have forgotten a good portion of what they were reminded of. You will never cease to come upon some act of treachery on their part, except for a few of them. Yet pardon them, and overlook. Allah loves good-doers"
