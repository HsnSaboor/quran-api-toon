quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,138,"We conveyed the tribe of Israel across the sea and they came upon some people who were devoting themselves to some idols which they had. They said, ´Musa, give us a god just as these people have gods.´ He said, ´You are indeed an ignorant people"
  7,139,What these people are doing is destined for destruction. What they are doing is purposeless.´
  7,140,"He said, ´Should I seek something other than Allah as a god for you when He has favoured you over all other beings?´"
  7,141,"Remember when We rescued you from Pharaoh´s people who were inflicting an evil punishment on you, killing your sons and letting your women live. In that there was a terrible trial from your Lord"
  7,142,"We set aside thirty nights for Musa and then completed them with ten, so the appointed time of his Lord was forty nights in all. Musa said to his brother Harun, ´Be my khalif among my people. Keep order and do not follow the way of the corrupters.´"
  7,143,"When Musa came to Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, ´My Lord, show me Yourself so that I may look at You!´ He said, ´You will not see Me, but look at the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, then you will see Me.´ But when His Lord manifested Himself to the mountain, He crushed it flat and Musa fell unconscious to the ground. When he regained consciousness he said, ´Glory be to You! I make tawba to You and I am the first of the muminun!´"
