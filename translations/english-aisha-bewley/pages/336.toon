quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,31,"Be people of pure natural belief in Allah, not associating anything else with Him. As for anyone who associates others with Allah, it is as though he had fallen from the sky and the birds had seized him and carried him away or the wind had dropped him in a distant place"
  22,32,"That is it. As for those who honour Allah´s sacred rites, that comes from the taqwa in their hearts"
  22,33,"You can make use of the sacrificial animals until a specified time, and then their place of sacrifice is by the Ancient House"
  22,34,We have appointed a rite of sacrifice for every nation so that they may invoke Allah´s name over the livestock He has given them. Your God is One God so submit to Him. Give good news to the humble-hearted
  22,35,"whose hearts quake at the mention of Allah, and who are steadfast in the face of all that happens to them, those who establish salat and give of what We have provided for them"
  22,36,"We have appointed the sacrificial animals for you as one of the sacred rites of Allah. There is good in them for you, so invoke Allah´s name over them, as they stand in rows. And then when they collapse on their sides, eat of them and feed both those who ask and those who are too shy to ask. In this way We have subjected them to you so that hopefully you will be thankful"
  22,37,Their flesh and blood does not reach Allah but your taqwa does reach Him. In this way He has subjected them to you so that you might proclaim Allah´s greatness for the way that He has guided you. Give good news to the good-doers
  22,38,Allah will defend those who have iman. Allah does not love any thankless traitor
