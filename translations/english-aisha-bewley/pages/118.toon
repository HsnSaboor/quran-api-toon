quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,58,When you call to salat they make a mockery and a game of it. That is because they are people who do not use their intellect
  5,59,"Say: ´People of the Book! do you resent us for any other reason than that we have iman in Allah and what was sent down to us, and what was sent down before, and because most of you are deviators?´"
  5,60,"Say: ´Shall I tell you of a reward with Allah far worse than that: that of those whom Allah has cursed and with whom He is angry — turning some of them into monkeys and into pigs — and who worshipped false gods? Such people are in a worse situation and further from the right way.´"
  5,61,"When they come to you, they say, ´We have iman.´ But they entered with kufr and left with it. Allah knows best what they were hiding"
  5,62,You see many of them rushing to wrongdoing and enmity and acquiring ill-gotten gains. What an evil thing they do
  5,63,Why do their scholars and rabbis not prohibit them from evil speech and acquiring ill-gotten gains? What an evil thing they invent
  5,64,"The Jews say, ´Allah´s hand is chained.´ Their hands are chained and they are cursed for what they say! No! Both His hands are open wide and He gives however He wills. What has been sent down to you from your Lord increases many of them in insolence and kufr. We have incited enmity and hatred between them until the Day of Rising. Each time they kindle the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it. They rush about the earth corrupting it. Allah does not love corrupters"
