quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,it truly is a Noble Qur´an
  56,78,in a well protected Book
  56,79,No one may touch it except the purified
  56,80,Revelation sent down from the Lord of all the worlds
  56,81,Do you nonetheless regard this discourse with scorn
  56,82,and think your provision depends on your denial of the truth
  56,83,"Why then, when death reaches his throat"
  56,84,and you are at that moment looking on —
  56,85,and We are nearer him than you but you cannot see —
  56,86,"why then, if you are not subject to Our command"
  56,87,do you not send it back if you are telling the truth
  56,88,But the truth is that if he is one of Those Brought Near
  56,89,there is solace and sweetness and a Garden of Delight
  56,90,And if he is one of the Companions of the Right
  56,91,´Peace be upon you!´ from the Companions of the Right
  56,92,And if he is one of the misguided deniers
  56,93,there is hospitality of scalding water
  56,94,and roasting in the Blazing Fire
  56,95,This is indeed the Truth of Certainty
  56,96,"So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Magnificent"
  57,1,"Everything in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah. He is the Almighty, the All-Wise"
  57,2,The kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. He gives life and causes to die. He has power over all things
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last, the Outward and the Inward. He has knowledge of all things"
