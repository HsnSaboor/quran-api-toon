quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  39,22,"Is he whose breast is opened to Islam, and who is therefore illuminated by his Lord . . . ? Woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of Allah! Such people are clearly misguided"
  39,23,"Allah has sent down the Supreme Discourse, a Book consistent in its frequent repetitions. The skins of those who fear their Lord tremble at it and then their skins and hearts yield softly to the remembrance of Allah. That is Allah´s guidance by which He guides whoever He wills. And no one can guide those whom Allah misguides"
  39,24,"Is someone who tries to shield himself with his face from the worst of the torment on the Day of Rising . . . ? The wrongdoers will be told, ´Taste what you have earned.´"
  39,25,Those before them also denied the truth and the punishment came upon them from where they did not expect

  39,30,You will die and they too will die
  39,31,Then on the Day of Rising you will argue in the presence of your Lord
