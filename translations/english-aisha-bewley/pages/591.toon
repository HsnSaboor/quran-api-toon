quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By Heaven and the Night-Comer
  86,2,And what will convey to you what the Night-Comer is
  86,3,The Piercing Star
  86,4,There is no self which has no guardian over it
  86,5,Man has only to look at what he was created from
  86,6,He was created from a spurting fluid
  86,7,emerging from between the back-bone and the breast-bone
  86,8,He certainly has the power to return him to life
  86,9,on the Day when the secrets are sought out
  86,10,and man will have no strength or helper
  86,11,By Heaven with its cyclical systems
  86,12,and the earth with its splitting seeds
  86,13,it is truly a Decisive Word
  86,14,It is no joke
  86,15,They are hatching a plot
  86,16,I too am hatching a plot
  86,17,So bear with the kafirun — bear with them for a while
  87,1,"Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High"
  87,2,He who created and moulded
  87,3,He who determined and guided
  87,4,He who brings forth green pasture
  87,5,then makes it blackened stubble
  87,6,We will cause you to recite so that you do not forget —
  87,7,except what Allah wills. He knows what is voiced out loud and what is hidden
  87,8,We will ease you to the Easy Way
  87,9,"Remind, then, if the reminder benefits"
  87,10,He who has fear will be reminded
  87,11,but the most miserable will shun it
  87,12,those who will roast in the Greatest Fire
  87,13,and then neither die nor live in it
  87,14,He who has purified himself will have success
  87,15,He who invokes the Name of his Lord and prays
