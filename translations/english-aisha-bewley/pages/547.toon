quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  59,10,"Those who have come after them say, ´Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in iman and do not put any rancour in our hearts towards those who have iman. Our Lord, You are All-Gentle, Most Merciful.´"
  59,11,"Did you not see the hypocrites saying to their brothers, those among the People of the Book who are kafir, ´If you are driven out we will leave with you, we will never obey anyone to your detriment. And if you are fought against we will help you´? Allah bears witness that they are truly liars"
  59,12,"If they are driven out they will not leave with them. If they are fought against they will not help them. And if they did help them they would turn their backs, and then they would not be helped"
  59,13,You are a greater cause of terror in their breasts than Allah! That is because they are people who do not understand
  59,14,They will not fight against you all together as a group except in fortified towns or behind high walls. Their hostility towards each other is intense. They are full of bravado in each other´s company. You consider them united but their hearts are scattered wide. That is because they are people who do not use their intellect
  59,15,They are the same as those a short time before them who tasted the evil consequences of what they did. They will have a painful punishment
  59,16,"They are like Shaytan when he says to a human being, ´Be kafir,´ and then when he becomes kafir, says, ´I wash my hands of you. Truly I fear Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.´"
