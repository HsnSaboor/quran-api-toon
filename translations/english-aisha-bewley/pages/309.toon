  19,53,"We endowed him with Our mercy, making his brother Harun a Prophet"
  19,54,Mention Isma´il in the Book. He was true to his promise and was a Messenger and a Prophet
  19,55,He used to command his people to do salat and give zakat and he was pleasing to his Lord
  19,56,Mention Idris in the Book. He was a true man and a Prophet

  19,58,"Those are some of the Prophets Allah has blessed, from the descendants of Adam and from those We carried with Nuh, and from the descendants of Ibrahim and Isra´il and from those We guided and chose. When the Signs of the All-Merciful were recited to them they fell on their faces, weeping, in prostration"
  19,59,An evil generation succeeded them who neglected the salat and followed their appetites. They will plunge into the Valley of Evil —

  19,64,"´We only descend at your Lord´s command. Everything in front of us, and everything behind us, and everything in between belongs to Him. Your Lord does not forget.´"
