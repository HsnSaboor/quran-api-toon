quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,37,They will want to get out of the Fire but they will not be able to. They will have an everlasting punishment
  5,38,"As for thieves, both male and female, cut off their hands in reprisal for what they have done: an object lesson from Allah. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise"
  5,39,"But if anyone makes tawba after his wrongdoing and puts things right, Allah will turn towards him. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  5,40,Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and earth belongs to Allah? He punishes whoever He wills and forgives whoever He wills. Allah has power over all things
  5,41,"O Messenger! do not be grieved by those who rush headlong into kufr among those who say ´We have iman´ with their tongues when their hearts contain no iman and among the Jews. Those who listen to lies listen to other people who have not come to you, distorting words from their proper meanings, saying, ´If you are given this, then take it. If you are not given it, then beware!´ If Allah desires misguidance for someone, you cannot help him against Allah in any way. Those are the people whose hearts Allah does not want to purify. They will have disgrace in this world and in the Next World they will have a terrible punishment"
