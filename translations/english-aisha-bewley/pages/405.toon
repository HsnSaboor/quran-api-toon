quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,6,That is Allah´s promise. Allah does not break His promise. But most people do not know it
  30,7,They know an outward aspect of the life of this world but are heedless of the Next World
  30,8,Have they not reflected within themselves? Allah did not create the heavens and the earth and everything between them except with truth and for a fixed term. Yet many people reject the meeting with their Lord
  30,9,Have they not travelled in the earth and seen the final fate of those before them? They had greater strength than them and cultivated the land and inhabited it in far greater numbers than they do. Their Messengers also came to them with the Clear Signs. Allah would never have wronged them; but they wronged themselves
  30,10,Then the final fate of those who did evil will be the Worst because they denied Allah´s Signs and mocked at them
  30,11,"Allah originates creation, then will regenerate it, then you will be returned to Him"
  30,12,On the Day the Hour arrives the evildoers will be in despair
  30,13,None of their partner-gods will intercede for them. They will reject their partner-gods
  30,14,"On the Day the Hour arrives, that Day they will be split up"
  30,15,"As for those who had iman and did right actions, they will be made joyful in a verdant meadow"
