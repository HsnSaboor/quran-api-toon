  17,70,We have honoured the sons of Adam and conveyed them on land and sea and provided them with good things and favoured them greatly over many We have created
  17,71,"On the Day We summon every people with their records, those who are given their Book in their right hand will read their Book and they will not be wronged by even the smallest speck"
  17,72,Those who are blind in this world will be blind in the Next World and even further off the Path
  17,73,"They were very near to enticing you away from some of what We have revealed to you, hoping that you would invent something against Us. Then they would have taken you as their intimate"

  17,75,Then We would have let you taste a double punishment in life and a double punishment in death. You would not have found any helper against Us
