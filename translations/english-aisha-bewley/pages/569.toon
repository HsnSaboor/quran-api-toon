quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,"even though they can see each other. An evildoer will wish he could ransom himself from the punishment of that Day, by means of his sons"
  70,12,or his wife or his brother
  70,13,or his family who sheltered him
  70,14,"or everyone else on earth, if that only meant that he could save himself"
  70,15,But no! It is a Raging Blaze
  70,16,stripping away the limbs and scalp
  70,17,which calls for all who drew back and turned away
  70,18,and amassed and hoarded up
  70,19,Truly man was created headstrong —
  70,20,desperate when bad things happen
  70,21,begrudging when good things come —
  70,22,except for those who do salat
  70,23,and are constant in it
  70,24,those in whose wealth there is a known share
  70,25,for beggars and the destitute
  70,26,those who affirm the Day of Judgement
  70,27,those who are fearful of the punishment of their Lord
  70,28,no one is safe from the punishment of his Lord
  70,29,those who guard their private parts
  70,30,"except from their wives and any slaves they own, in which case they incur no blame"
  70,31,"but if anyone desires any more than that, they have overstepped the limits"
  70,32,those who honour their trusts and contracts
  70,33,those who stand by their testimony
  70,34,those who safeguard their salat
  70,35,"such people will be in Gardens, highly honoured"
  70,36,"What is the matter with those who are kafir? They run about in front of you, with outstretched necks and staring eyes"
  70,37,on the right and on the left in scattered groups
  70,38,Does each one of them aspire to be admitted into a Garden of Delight
  70,39,Certainly not! We created them from what they know full well
