quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  42,16,"The argument of those who argue about Allah, once He has been acknowledged, has no basis whatsoever with their Lord. There is anger upon them and they will have a harsh punishment"
  42,17,It is Allah who has sent down the Book with truth and with the Just Balance. What will make you realise? Perhaps the Hour is close
  42,18,Those who do not have iman in it try to hasten it. But those who have iman in it are afraid of it. They know it is the truth. Those who doubt the Hour are greatly misguided
  42,19,"Allah is very gentle with His slaves. He provides for anyone He wills. He is the Most Strong, the Almighty"
  42,20,"If anyone desires to cultivate the Next World, We will increase him in his cultivation. If anyone desires to cultivate this world, We will give him some of it but he will have no share in the Next World"
  42,21,"Or do they have partners who have laid down a deen for them for which Allah has not given any authority? Were it not for the prior Word of Decision, the judgement between them would already have been made. The wrongdoers will have a painful punishment"
  42,22,"You will see the wrongdoers afraid of what they have earned, when it is about to land right on top of them, whereas those who have iman and do right actions will be in the lush Meadows of the Gardens. They will have whatever they wish for with their Lord. That is the great favour"
