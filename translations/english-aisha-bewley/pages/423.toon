quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,When Allah and His Messenger have decided something it is not for any man or woman of the muminin to have a choice about it. Anyone who disobeys Allah and His Messenger is clearly misguided
  33,37,"When you said to him whom Allah has blessed and you yourself have greatly favoured, ´Keep your wife to yourself and have taqwa of Allah,´ while concealing something in yourself which Allah wished to bring to light, you were fearing people when Allah has more right to your fear. Then when Zayd divorced her We married her to you so that there should be no restriction for the muminun regarding the wives of their adopted sons when they have divorced them. Allah´s command is always carried out"
  33,38,There is no restriction on the Prophet regarding anything Allah allots to him. This was Allah´s pattern with those who passed away before — and Allah´s command is a pre-ordained decree —
  33,39,"those who conveyed Allah´s Message and had taqwa of Him, fearing no one except Allah. Allah suffices as a Reckoner"
  33,40,"Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but the Messenger of Allah and the Final Seal of the Prophets. Allah has knowledge of all things"
  33,41,You who have iman! remember Allah much
  33,42,and glorify Him in the morning and the evening
  33,43,"It is He Who calls down blessing on you, as do His angels, to bring you out of the darkness into the light. He is Most Merciful to the muminun"
