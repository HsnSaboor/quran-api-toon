quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"Knowledge of the Hour is referred to Him. And no fruit emerges from its husk, nor does any female get pregnant or give birth, without His knowledge. On the Day He calls out to them: ´Where are My associates?´ they will say, ´We declare to you that none of us is a witness.´"
  41,48,What they called upon before will have forsaken them and they will realise they have no way of escape
  41,49,"Man never tires of praying for the good and if evil touches him, he despairs and loses hope"
  41,50,"But if We let him taste mercy from Us after he has suffered hardship, then he says, ´This is my due. I do not think that the Hour is going to come. And if am returned to my Lord, I will definitely find the best reward with Him.´ But We will inform those who are kafir of what they did and make them suffer a ruthless punishment"
  41,51,"When We grant blessing to a man, he turns away and draws aside but when any evil touches him, he is full of endless prayers"
  41,52,"Say: ´What do you think? If it is from Allah and you reject it, who could be more misguided than someone entrenched in hostility to it?´"
  41,53,We will show them Our Signs on the horizon and within themselves until it is clear to them that it is the truth. Is it not enough for your Lord that He is a witness of everything
  41,54,What! Are they in doubt about the meeting with their Lord? What! Does He not encompass all things
