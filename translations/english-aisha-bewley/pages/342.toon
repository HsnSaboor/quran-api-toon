quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,It is the muminun who are successful
  23,2,those who are humble in their salat
  23,3,those who turn away from worthless talk
  23,4,those who pay zakat
  23,5,those who guard their private parts —
  23,6,"except from their wives or those they own as slaves, in which case they are not blameworthy"
  23,7,but those who desire anything more than that are people who have gone beyond the limits —
  23,8,those who honour their trusts and their contracts
  23,9,those who safeguard their salat
  23,10,such people are the inheritors
  23,11,"who will inherit Firdaws, remaining in it timelessly, for ever"
  23,12,We created man from the purest kind of clay
  23,13,then made him a drop in a secure receptacle
  23,14,"then formed the drop into a clot and formed the clot into a lump and formed the lump into bones and clothed the bones in flesh; and then brought him into being as another creature. Blessed be Allah, the Best of Creators"
  23,15,Then subsequently you will certainly die
  23,16,Then on the Day of Rising you will be raised again
  23,17,We created above you seven levels and We were not unaware of the creation
