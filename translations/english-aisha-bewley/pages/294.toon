quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  18,5,"They have no knowledge of this, neither they nor their fathers. It is a monstrous utterance which has issued from their mouths. What they say is nothing but a lie"
  18,6,"Perhaps you may destroy yourself with grief, chasing after them, if they do not have iman in these words"
  18,7,We made everything on the earth adornment for it so that We could test them to see whose actions are the best
  18,8,We will certainly make everything on it a barren wasteland
  18,9,Do you consider that the Companions of the Cave and Ar-Raqim were one of the most remarkable of Our Signs
  18,10,"When the young men took refuge in the cave and said, ´Our Lord, give us mercy directly from You and open the way for us to right guidance in our situation.´"
  18,11,So We sealed their ears with sleep in the cave for a number of years
  18,12,Then We woke them up again so that We might see which of the two groups would better calculate the time they had stayed there
  18,13,We will relate their story to you with truth. They were young men who had iman in their Lord and We increased them in guidance
  18,14,"We fortified their hearts when they stood up and said, ´Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and We will not call on any god apart from Him. We would in that case have uttered an abomination"
  18,15,These people of ours have taken gods apart from Him. Why do they not produce a clear authority concerning them? Who could do greater wrong than someone who invents a lie against Allah
