quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  24,21,"You who have iman! do not follow in the footsteps of Shaytan. Anyone who follows in Shaytan´s footsteps should know that he commands indecency and wrongdoing. Were it not for Allah´s favour to you and His mercy, not one of you would ever have been purified. But Allah purifies whoever He wills. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
  24,22,"Those of you possessing affluence and ample wealth should not make oaths that they will not give to their relatives and the very poor and those who have made hijra in the way of Allah. They should rather pardon and overlook. Would you not love Allah to forgive you? Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  24,23,"Those who accuse women who are chaste, but who are careless and yet have iman, are cursed both in this world and the Next World, and they will have a terrible punishment"
  24,24,on the Day when their tongues and hands and feet will testify against them about what they were doing
  24,25,"On that Day Allah will pay them in full what is due to them, and they will know that Allah is the Clear Truth"
  24,26,"Corrupt women are for corrupt men and corrupt men are for corrupt women, Good women are for good men and good men are for good women. The latter are innocent of what they say. They will have forgiveness and generous provision"
  24,27,"You who have iman! do not enter houses other than your own until you have asked permission and greeted their inhabitants. That is better for you, so that hopefully you will pay heed"
