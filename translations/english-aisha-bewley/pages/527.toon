quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,Those who do not have iman in the Next World give the angels female names
  53,28,They have no knowledge of this. They are only following conjecture. Conjecture is of no avail whatever against the truth
  53,29,So turn away from him who turns away from Our remembrance and desires nothing but the life of this world
  53,30,That is as far as their knowledge extends. Your Lord knows best those who are misguided from His Way and He knows best those who are guided
  53,31,Everything in the heavens and everything in the earth belongs to Allah so that He can repay those who do evil for what they did and repay those who do good with the Very Best
  53,32,"To whoever avoids the major wrong actions and indecencies — except for minor lapses — truly your Lord is vast in forgiveness. He has most knowledge of you when He first produced you from the earth, and when you were embryos in your mothers´ wombs. So do not claim purity for yourselves. He knows best those who have taqwa"
  53,33,Have you seen him who turns away
  53,34,"and gives little, and that grudgingly"
  53,35,"Does he have knowledge of the Unseen, enabling him to see"
  53,36,Or has he not been informed what is in the texts of Musa
  53,37,"and of Ibrahim, who paid his dues in full"
  53,38,that no burden-bearer can bear another´s burden
  53,39,that man will have nothing but what he strives for
  53,40,that his striving will most certainly be seen
  53,41,that he will then receive repayment of the fullest kind
  53,42,that the ultimate end is with your Lord
  53,43,that it is He Who brings about both laughter and tears
  53,44,that it is He Who brings about both death and life
