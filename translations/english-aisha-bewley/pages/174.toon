quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  7,179,"We created many of the jinn and mankind for Hell. They have hearts they do not understand with. They have eyes they do not see with. They have ears they do not hear with. Such people are like cattle. No, they are even further astray! They are the unaware"
  7,180,"To Allah belong the Most Beautiful Names, so call on Him by them and abandon those who desecrate His Names. They will be repaid for what they did"
  7,181,Among those We have created there is a community who guide by the Truth and act justly according to it
  7,182,"But as for those who deny Our Signs, We will lead them, step by step, into destruction from where they do not know"
  7,183,I will give them more time. My strategy is sure
  7,184,Have they not reflected? Their companion is not mad. He is only a clear warner
  7,185,"Have they not looked into the dominions of the heavens and the earth and what Allah has created, and seen that it may well be that their appointed time is near? In what discourse after this will they have iman"
  7,186,"If Allah misguides people, no one can guide them. We will abandon them to wander blindly in their excessive insolence"
  7,187,"They will ask you about the Hour: when is it due? Say: ´Knowledge of it rests with my Lord alone. He alone will reveal it at its proper time. It hangs heavy in the heavens and the earth. It will not come upon you except suddenly.´ They will ask you as if you had full knowledge of it. Say: ´Knowledge of it rests with Allah alone. But most people do not know that.´"
