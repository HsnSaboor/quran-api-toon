quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,23,"Intercession with Him will be of no benefit except from someone who has His permission. So that when the terror has left their hearts they will say, ´What did your Lord say?´ They will say, ´The truth. He is the All-High, the Most Great.´"
  34,24,"Say: ´Who provides for you from the heavens and earth?´ Say: ´Allah. It is certain that one or the other of us, either we or you, is following guidance or else clearly astray.´"
  34,25,"Say: ´You will not be asked about any evil we committed and we will not be asked about what you did.´"
  34,26,"Say: ´Our Lord will bring us all together and then will judge between us with the truth. He is the Just Decider, the All-Knowing.´"
  34,27,"Say: ´Show me those you have joined to Him as associates. No indeed! He is Allah, the Almighty, the All-Wise.´"
  34,28,"We only sent you for the whole of mankind, bringing good news and giving warning. But most of mankind do not know it"
  34,29,"They say, ´When will this promise come about if you are telling the truth?´"
  34,30,"Say: ´You have a promised appointment on a Day which you cannot delay or advance a single hour.´"
  34,31,"Those who are kafir say, ´We will never have iman in this Qur´an, nor in what came before it.´ If only you could see when the wrongdoers, standing in the presence of their Lord, cast accusations back and forth at one another! Those deemed weak will say to those deemed great, ´Were it not for you, we would have been muminun!´"
