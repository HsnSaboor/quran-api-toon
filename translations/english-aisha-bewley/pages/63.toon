quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,"How can you be kafir, when Allah´s Signs are recited to you and the Messenger is there among you? Whoever holds fast to Allah has been guided to a straight path"
  3,102,You who have iman! have taqwa of Allah with the taqwa due to Him and do not die except as Muslims
  3,103,"Hold fast to the rope of Allah all together, and do not separate. Remember Allah´s blessing to you when you were enemies and He joined your hearts together so that you became brothers by His blessing. You were on the very brink of a pit of the Fire and He rescued you from it. In this way Allah makes His Signs clear to you, so that hopefully you will be guided"
  3,104,"Let there be a community among you who call to the good, and enjoin the right, and forbid the wrong. They are the ones who have success"
  3,105,Do not be like those who split up and differed after the Clear Signs came to them. They will have a terrible punishment
  3,106,"on the Day when faces are whitened and faces are blackened. As for those whose faces are blackened: ´What! Did you become kafir after having had iman? Taste the punishment for your kufr!´"
  3,107,"As for those whose faces are whitened, they are in Allah´s mercy, remaining in it timelessly, for ever"
  3,108,These are Allah´s Signs which We recite to you with truth. Allah desires no wrong for any being
