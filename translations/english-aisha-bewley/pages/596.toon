quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,in which only the most wretched will roast —
  92,16,those who denied and turned away
  92,17,Those with most taqwa will be far removed from it
  92,18,those who give their wealth to purify themselves —
  92,19,not to repay someone else for a favour done —
  92,20,desiring only the Face of their Lord Most High
  92,21,They will certainly be satisfied
  93,1,By the morning brightness
  93,2,and the night when it is still
  93,3,your Lord has not abandoned you nor does He hate you
  93,4,The Last will be better for you than the First
  93,5,Your Lord will soon give to you and you will be satisfied
  93,6,Did He not find you orphaned and shelter you
  93,7,Did He not find you wandering and guide you
  93,8,Did He not find you impoverished and enrich you
  93,9,"So as for orphans, do not oppress them"
  93,10,"and as for beggars, do not berate them"
  93,11,"And as for the blessing of your Lord, speak out"
  94,1,Did We not expand your breast for you
  94,2,and remove your load from you
  94,3,which weighed down your back
  94,4,Did We not raise your renown high
  94,5,For truly with hardship comes ease
  94,6,truly with hardship comes ease
  94,7,"So when you have finished, work on"
  94,8,and make your Lord your goal
