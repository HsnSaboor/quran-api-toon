quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,80,"You can ask forgiveness for them, or not ask forgiveness for them. Even if you asked forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah still would not forgive them. That is because they have rejected Allah and His Messenger. Allah does not guide deviant people"
  9,81,"Those who were left behind were glad to stay behind the Messenger of Allah. They did not want to do jihad with their wealth and themselves in the Way of Allah. They said, ´Do not go out to fight in the heat.´ Say: ´The Fire of Hell is much hotter, if they only understood.´"
  9,82,"Let them laugh little and weep much, in repayment for what they have earned"
  9,83,"If Allah returns you to a group of them, and they ask you for permission to go out, say, ´You will never go out with me, nor will you ever fight an enemy with me. You were happy to stay behind the first time, so stay behind with those who are left behind.´"
  9,84,Never pray over any of them who die or stand at their graves. They rejected Allah and His Messenger and died as deviators
  9,85,"Do not let their wealth and their children impress you. Allah merely wants to punish them by them in this world, and for them to expire while they are kafirun"
  9,86,"When a sura is sent down saying: ´Have iman in Allah and do jihad together with His Messenger,´ those among them with wealth will ask you to excuse them, saying, ´Let us remain with those who stay behind.´"
