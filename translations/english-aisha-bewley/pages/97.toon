quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"There is no good in much of their secret talk, except in the case of those who enjoin sadaqa, or what is right, or putting things right between people. If anyone does that, seeking the pleasure of Allah, We will give him an immense reward"
  4,115,"But if anyone opposes the Messenger after the guidance has become clear to him, and follows other than the path of the muminun, We will hand him over to whatever he has turned to, and We will roast him in Hell. What an evil destination"
  4,116,Allah does not forgive anything being associated with Him but He forgives whoever He wills for anything other than that. Anyone who associates something with Allah has gone very far astray
  4,117,What they call on apart from Him are female idols. What they call on is an arrogant shaytan
  4,118,"whom Allah has cursed. He said, ´I will take a certain fixed proportion of Your slaves"
  4,119,I will lead them astray and fill them with false hopes. I will command them and they will cut off cattle´s ears. I will command them and they will change Allah´s creation.´ Anyone who takes Shaytan as his protector in place of Allah has clearly lost everything
  4,120,He makes promises to them and fills them with false hopes. But what Shaytan promises them is nothing but delusion
  4,121,The shelter of such people will be Hell. They will find no way to escape from it
