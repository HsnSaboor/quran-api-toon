quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,39,Among His Signs is that you see the earth laid bare and then when We send down water on it it quivers and swells. He who gives it life is He who gives life to the dead. Certainly He has power over all things
  41,40,Those who adulterate Our Signs are not concealed from Us. Who is better — someone who will be thrown into the fire or someone who will arrive in safety on the Day of Rising? Do what you like. He sees whatever you do
  41,41,Those who reject the Remembrance when it comes to them — truly it is a Mighty Book
  41,42,"falsehood cannot reach it from before it or behind it — it is a revelation from One who is All-Wise, Praiseworthy"
  41,43,Nothing has been said to you that was not said to the Messengers before you. Your Lord is the Possessor of forgiveness but also of painful retribution
  41,44,"If We had made it a Qur´an in a foreign tongue they would have said, ´Why have its Signs not been made plain? What! A foreign language for an Arab?´ Say: ´It is guidance and healing for people who have iman. Those who do not have iman have heaviness in their ears and for them it is blindness. Such people are being called from a very distant place.´"
  41,45,"We gave Musa the Book but there was disagreement about it. And had it not been for a prior Word from your Lord, the judgement between them would already have been made. They are indeed in grave doubt about it"
  41,46,"Whoever acts rightly, it is to his own good. Whoever does evil, it is to his detriment. Your Lord does not wrong His slaves"
