quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  27,56,"the only response of his people was to say: ´Drive the family of Lut out of your city! They are people who keep themselves pure!´"
  27,57,So We rescued him and his family — except for his wife. We ordained her to be one of those who stayed behind
  27,58,We rained down a rain upon them. How evil is the rain of those who are warned
  27,59,"Say: ´Praise be to Allah and peace be upon His slaves whom He has chosen.´ Is Allah better, or what you associate with Him"
  27,60,"He Who created the heavens and the earth and sends down water for you from the sky by which We make luxuriant gardens grow — you could never make their trees grow. Is there another god besides Allah? No indeed, but they are people who equate others with Him"
  27,61,"He Who made the earth a stable dwelling place and appointed rivers flowing through its midst and placed firmly embedded mountains on it and set a barrier between the two seas. Is there another god besides Allah? No indeed, but most of them do not know it"
  27,62,"He Who responds to the oppressed when they call on Him and removes their distress, and has appointed you as khalifs on the earth. Is there another god besides Allah? How little you pay heed"
  27,63,He Who guides you in the darkness of land and sea and sends out the winds bringing advance news of His mercy. Is there another god besides Allah? May Allah be exalted above what they associate with Him
