quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"Those who practise usury will not rise from the grave except as someone driven mad by Shaytan´s touch. That is because they say, ´Trade is the same as usury.´ But Allah has permitted trade and He has forbidden usury. Whoever is given a warning by his Lord and then desists, may keep what he received in the past and his affair is Allah´s concern. But all who return to it will be the Companions of the Fire, remaining in it timelessly, for ever"
  2,276,Allah obliterates usury but makes sadaqa grow in value! Allah does not love any persistently ungrateful wrongdoer
  2,277,"Those who have iman and do right actions and establish salat and pay zakat, will have their reward with their Lord. They will feel no fear and will know no sorrow"
  2,278,You who have iman! have taqwa of Allah and forgo any remaining usury if you are muminun
  2,279,"If you do not, know that it means war from Allah and His Messenger. But if you make tawba you may have your capital, without wronging and without being wronged"
  2,280,"If someone is in difficult circumstances, there should be a deferral until things are easier. But making a free gift of it would be better for you if you only knew"
  2,281,Have fear of a Day when you will be returned to Allah. Then every self will be paid in full for what it earned. They will not be wronged
