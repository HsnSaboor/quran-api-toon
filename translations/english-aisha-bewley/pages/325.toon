quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  21,36,"When those who are kafir see you, they only make a mockery out of you: ´Is this the one who makes mention of your gods?´ Yet they are kuffar about the mention of the All-Merciful"
  21,37,Man was created hasty. I will show you My Signs so do not try to hasten Me
  21,38,"They say, ´When will this promise come about if you are telling the truth?´"
  21,39,If those who are kafir only knew of the time when they will not be able to keep the Fire away from their faces or their backs! And they will receive no help
  21,40,"No, it will come upon them suddenly, confounding them, taking them completely by surprise, and they will not be able to ward it off. They will be granted no reprieve"
  21,41,"Messengers before you were also mocked, but those who jeered were engulfed by what they mocked"
  21,42,"Say: ´Who will protect you night and day from the All-Merciful?´ Yet they turn away from the remembrance of their Lord"
  21,43,Or do they have gods besides Us who will protect them? They cannot even help themselves! They will not be safe from Us
  21,44,"No indeed! We have given these people enjoyment, as We did their fathers, until life seemed long and good to them. Do they not see how We come to the land eroding it from its extremities? Or are they the victors"
