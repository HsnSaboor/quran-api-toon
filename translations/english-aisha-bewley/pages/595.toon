quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and its morning brightness
  91,2,and the moon when it follows it
  91,3,and the day when it displays it
  91,4,and the night when it conceals it
  91,5,and the sky and what erected it
  91,6,and the earth and what extended it
  91,7,and the self and what proportioned it
  91,8,and inspired it with depravity or taqwa
  91,9,he who purifies it has succeeded
  91,10,he who covers it up has failed
  91,11,Thamud denied in their excessive tyranny —
  91,12,when the worst of them rushed ahead
  91,13,"and the Messenger of Allah had said to them, ´This is the she-camel of Allah, so let her drink!´"
  91,14,"But they denied him and they hamstrung her, so their Lord crushed them for their sin and flattened them"
  91,15,And He does not fear the consequences
  92,1,By the night when it conceals
  92,2,and the day when it reveals
  92,3,and the creation of male and female
  92,4,there is a vast difference in your striving
  92,5,As for him who gives out and has taqwa
  92,6,and confirms the Good
  92,7,We will pave his way to Ease
  92,8,But as for him who is stingy and self-satisfied
  92,9,and denies the Good
  92,10,We will pave his way to Difficulty
  92,11,His wealth will not help him when he plummets to the depths
  92,12,Assuredly guidance is up to Us
  92,13,and both the Last and First belong to Us
  92,14,I have warned you of a Fire which rages
