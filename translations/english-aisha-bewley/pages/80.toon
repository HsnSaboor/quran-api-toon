quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,15,"If any of your women commit fornication, four of you must be witnesses against them. If they bear witness, detain them in their homes until death releases them or Allah ordains another procedure for their case"
  4,16,"If two men commit a like abomination, punish them. If they make tawba and reform, leave them alone. Allah is Ever-Returning, Most Merciful"
  4,17,"Allah only accepts the tawba of those who do evil in ignorance and then quickly make tawba after doing it. Allah turns towards such people. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  4,18,"There is no tawba for people who persist in doing evil until death comes to them and who then say, ´Now I make tawba,´ nor for people who die kafir. We have prepared for them a painful punishment"
  4,19,"You who have iman! it is not halal for you to inherit women by force. Nor may you treat them harshly so that you can make off with part of what you have given them, unless they commit an act of flagrant indecency. Live together with them correctly and courteously. If you dislike them, it may well be that you dislike something in which Allah has placed a lot of good"
