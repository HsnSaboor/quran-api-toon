  2,50,"And when We parted the sea for you and rescued you, and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you watched"

  2,52,Then We pardoned you after that so that perhaps you would show thanks
  2,53,Remember when We gave Musa the Book and discrimination so that perhaps you would be guided
  2,54,"And when Musa said to his people, ´My people, You wronged yourselves by adopting the Calf so turn towards your Maker and kill yourselves. That is the best thing for you in your Maker´s sight.´ And He turned towards you. He is the Ever-Returning, the Most Merciful"
  2,55,"And when you said, ´Musa, we will not believe in you until we see Allah with our own eyes.´ So the thunder-bolt struck you dead while you were looking"

  2,57,"And We shaded you with clouds and sent down manna and quails to you: ´Eat of the good things We have provided for you.´ They did not wrong Us; rather it was themselves they were wronging"
