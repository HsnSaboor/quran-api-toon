quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  25,12,"When it sees them coming from a long way off, they will hear it seething and rasping"
  25,13,"When they are flung into a narrow place in it, shackled together in chains, they will cry out there for destruction"
  25,14,"´Do not cry out today for just one destruction, cry out for many destructions!´"
  25,15,"Say: ´Is that better, or the Garden of Eternal Life which has been promised to those who have taqwa? That is their recompense and destination.´"

  25,17,"On the Day We gather them together, and those they worship besides Allah, and say, ´Did you misguide these slaves of Mine or did they stray from the way of their own accord?´"
  25,18,"they will say, ´Glory be to You! It would not have been fitting for us to have taken any protectors apart from You. But You let them and their fathers enjoy themselves so that they forgot the Reminder. They were people devoid of good.´"
  25,19,"So now they have disowned you for what you said, and they cannot avert it or give you any help. As for anyone among you who has done wrong, We will make him suffer great punishment"
  25,20,We never sent any Messengers before you who did not eat food and walk in the market-place. But We have made some of you a trial for others to see if you will be steadfast? Your Lord sees everything
