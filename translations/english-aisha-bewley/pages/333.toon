quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  22,6,That is because Allah is the Real and gives life to the dead and has power over all things
  22,7,and the Hour is coming without any doubt and Allah will raise up all those in the graves
  22,8,Among people there is one who argues about Allah without knowledge or guidance or any light-giving Book
  22,9,"turning away arrogantly, to misguide people from the Way of Allah. He will be disgraced in this world and on the Day of Rising We will make him taste the punishment of the Burning"
  22,10,´That is for what you did before. Allah does not wrong His slaves.´
  22,11,"Among the people there is one who worships Allah right on the edge. If good befalls him, he is content with it, but if a trial befalls him, he reverts to his former ways, losing both this world and the Next World. That is indeed sheer loss"
  22,12,"Instead of Allah, he calls on something which cannot harm him or help him. That is extreme misguidance"
  22,13,He calls on what is far more likely to harm than help. What an evil protector! What an evil associate
  22,14,Allah will admit those who have iman and do right actions into Gardens with rivers flowing under them. Allah does whatever He wishes
  22,15,Anyone who thinks that Allah will not help him in this world and the Next World should stretch a rope up to the ceiling and then hang himself. Let him see whether his stratagem gets rid of what enrages him
