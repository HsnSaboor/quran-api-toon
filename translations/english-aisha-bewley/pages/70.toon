quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  3,154,"Then He sent down to you, after the distress, security, restful sleep overtaking a group of you, whereas another group became prey to anxious thoughts, thinking other than the truth about Allah — thoughts belonging to the Time of Ignorance — saying, ´Do we have any say in the affair at all?´ Say, ´The affair belongs entirely to Allah.´ They are concealing within themselves things which they do not disclose to you, saying, ´If we had only had a say in the affair, none of us would have been killed here in this place.´ Say, ´Even if you had been inside your homes, those people for whom being killed was decreed would have gone out to their place of death.´ So that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts. Allah knows all that your hearts contain"
  3,155,"Those of you who turned their backs on the day the two armies clashed — it was Shaytan who made them slip for what they had done. But Allah has pardoned them. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, All-Forbearing"
  3,156,"You who have iman! do not be like those who are kafir and say of their brothers, when they are going on journeys or military expeditions, ´If they had only been with us, they would not have died or been killed,´ so that Allah can make that anguish for them in their hearts. It is Allah Who gives life and causes to die. Allah sees what you do"
  3,157,"If you are killed in the Way of Allah or if you die, forgiveness and mercy from Allah are better than anything you can acquire"
