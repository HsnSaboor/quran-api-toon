quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,He reflected and considered
  74,19,"Curse him, how he considered"
  74,20,"Again curse him, how he considered"
  74,21,Then he looked
  74,22,Then he frowned and glowered
  74,23,Then he drew back and was proud
  74,24,"He said, ´This is nothing but magic from the past"
  74,25,This is nothing but the words of a human being.´
  74,26,I will roast him in Saqar
  74,27,What will convey to you what Saqar is
  74,28,It does not spare and does not ease up
  74,29,ceaselessly scorching the flesh
  74,30,There are nineteen in charge of it
  74,31,"We have only appointed angels as masters of the Fire and We have only specified their number as a trial for those who are kafir; so that those who were given the Book might gain in certainty, and those who have iman might increase in their iman, and both those who were given the Book and the muminun might have no doubt; and so that those with sickness in their hearts and the kuffar might say, ´What did Allah intend by this example?´ In this way Allah misguides those He wills and guides those He wills. No one knows the legions of your Lord but Him. This is nothing but a reminder to all human beings"
  74,32,No indeed! By the moon
  74,33,and the night when it withdraws
  74,34,and the dawn when it grows bright
  74,35,it truly is one of the greatest of all things
  74,36,a warning to human beings
  74,37,for any of you who want to go forward or hang back
  74,38,Every self is held in pledge against what it earned
  74,39,except for the companions of the Right
  74,40,In Gardens they will ask
  74,41,ask the evildoers
  74,42,´What caused you to enter Saqar?´
  74,43,"They will say, ´We were not among those who did salat"
  74,44,and we did not feed the poor
  74,45,We plunged with those who plunged
  74,46,and denied the Day of Judgment
  74,47,until the Certain came to us.´
