quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  62,9,"You who have iman! when you are called to salat on the Day of Jumu´a, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and abandon trade. That is better for you if you only knew"
  62,10,Then when the salat is finished spread through the earth and seek Allah´s bounty and remember Allah much so that hopefully you will be successful
  62,11,"But when they see a chance of trade or entertainment they scatter off to it and leave you standing there. Say: ´What is with Allah is better than trade or entertainment. Allah is the Best of Providers.´"
  63,1,"When the hypocrites come to you they say, ´We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allah.´ Allah knows that you are indeed His Messenger and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are certainly liars"
  63,2,They have made their oaths into a cloak and barred the Way of Allah. What they have done is truly evil
  63,3,That is because they have had iman and then returned to kufr. So their hearts have been sealed up and they cannot understand
  63,4,"When you see them, their outward form appeals to you, and if they speak you listen to what they say. But they are like propped-up planks of wood. They imagine every cry to be against them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. Allah fight them! How they are perverted"
