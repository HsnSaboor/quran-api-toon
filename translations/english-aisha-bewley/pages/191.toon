  9,28,"You who have iman! the idolaters are unclean, so after this year they should not come near the Masjid al-Haram. If you fear impoverishment, Allah will enrich you from His bounty if He wills. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  9,29,"Fight those of the people who were given the Book who do not have iman in Allah and the Last Day and who do not make haram what Allah and His Messenger have made haram and do not take as their deen the deen of Truth, until they pay the jizya with their own hands in a state of complete abasement"
  9,30,"The Jews say, ´´Uzayr is the son of Allah,´ and the Christians say, ´The Messiah is the son of Allah.´ That is what they say with their mouths, copying the words of those who were kafir before. Allah fight them! How perverted they are"
  9,31,"They have taken their rabbis and monks as lords besides Allah, and also the Messiah, son of Maryam. Yet they were commanded to worship only one God. There is no god but Him! Glory be to Him above anything they associate with Him"
