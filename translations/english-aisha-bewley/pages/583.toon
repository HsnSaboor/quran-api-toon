quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,For those who have taqwa there is triumph
  78,32,Gardens and grape vines
  78,33,and nubile maidens of similar age
  78,34,and an overflowing cup
  78,35,where they will hear no prattle and no denial
  78,36,"a recompense from your Lord, a commensurate gift"
  78,37,"Lord of the heavens and earth and everything between them, the All-Merciful. They will not have the power to speak to Him"
  78,38,"On the Day when the Spirit and the angels stand in ranks, no one will speak, except for him who is authorised by the All-Merciful and says what is right"
  78,39,That will be the True Day. So whoever wills should take the way back to his Lord
  78,40,"We have warned you of an imminent punishment on the Day when a man will see what he has done, and the kafir will say, ´Oh, if only I were dust!´"
  79,1,By those who pluck out harshly
  79,2,and those who draw out gently
  79,3,and those who glide serenely
  79,4,and those who outrun easily
  79,5,and those who direct affairs
  79,6,On the Day the first blast shudders
  79,7,and the second blast follows it
  79,8,hearts that Day will be pounding
  79,9,and eyes will be cast down
  79,10,"They will say, ´Are we to be restored to how we were"
  79,11,"when we have become perished, worm-eaten bones?´"
  79,12,"They say, ´That will clearly be a losing restoration!´"
  79,13,There will be but one Great Blast
  79,14,"and at once they will be on the surface, wide awake"
  79,15,Has the story of Musa reached you
