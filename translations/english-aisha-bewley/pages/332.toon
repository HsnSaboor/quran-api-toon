quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  22,1,"Mankind, have taqwa of your Lord! The quaking of the Hour is a terrible thing"
  22,2,"On the day they see it, every nursing woman will be oblivious of the baby at her breast, and every pregnant woman will abort the contents of her womb, and you will think people drunk when they are not drunk; it is just that the punishment of Allah is so severe"
  22,3,"Among people there is one who argues about Allah without knowledge, and follows every rebellious shaytan"
  22,4,"It is written of him that if anyone takes him as a friend, he will mislead him and guide him to the punishment of the Searing Blaze"
  22,5,"Mankind! if you are in any doubt about the Rising, know that We created you from dust then from a drop of sperm then from a clot of blood then from a lump of flesh, formed yet unformed, so We may make things clear to you. We make whatever We want stay in the womb until a specified time and then We bring you out as children so that you can reach your full maturity. Some of you die and some of you revert to the lowest form of life so that, after having knowledge, they then know nothing at all. And you see the earth dead and barren; then when We send down water onto it it quivers and swells and sprouts with luxuriant plants of every kind"
