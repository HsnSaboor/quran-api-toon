quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  41,21,"They will ask their skins, ´Why did you testify against us?´ and they will reply, ´Allah gave us speech as He has given speech to everything. He created you in the first place and you will be returned to Him"
  41,22,"You did not think to shield yourselves from your hearing, sight and skin testifying against you and you thought that Allah would never know much of what you did"
  41,23,It is that thought you had about your Lord that has destroyed you so now you find yourselves among the lost.´
  41,24,"If they are steadfast, the Fire will still be their residence! If they ask for favour, no favour will be given"
  41,25,"We have assigned close comrades to them who have made what is before them and behind them seem good to them. And the statement about the nations, both of jinn and men, who passed away before them has proved true of them as well. Certainly they were lost"
  41,26,"Those who are kafir say, ´Do not listen to this Qur´an. Drown it out so that hopefully you will gain the upper hand.´"
  41,27,We will make those who are kafir suffer a severe punishment and repay them for the worst of what they did
  41,28,That is the repayment of the enemies of Allah — the Fire. They will have it for their Eternal Home as repayment for their renunciation of Our Signs
  41,29,"Those who are kafir say, ´Our Lord, show us those jinn and men who misguided us and we will place them beneath our feet so that they will be among the lowest of the low.´"
