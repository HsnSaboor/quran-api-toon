quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"Say: ´Can any of your partner-gods bring creation out of nothing and then regenerate it?´ Say: ´Allah brings creation out of nothing and then regenerates it. So how have you been perverted?´"
  10,35,"Say: ´Can any of your partner-gods guide to the truth?´ Say: ´Allah guides to the truth. Who has more right to be followed — He who guides to the truth, or he who cannot guide unless he is guided? What is the matter with you? How do you reach your judgement?´"
  10,36,Most of them follow nothing but conjecture. Conjecture is of no use whatsoever against the truth. Allah most certainly knows what they are doing
  10,37,This Qur´an could never have been devised by any besides Allah. Rather it is confirmation of what came before it and an elucidation of the Book which contains no doubt from the Lord of all the worlds
  10,38,"Do they say, ´He has invented it´? Say: ´Then produce a sura like it and call on anyone you can besides Allah if you are telling the truth.´"
  10,39,"No, the fact is that they have denied something which their knowledge does not embrace and the meaning of which has not yet reached them. In the same way those before them also denied the truth. See the final fate of the wrongdoers"
  10,40,Among them there are some who have iman in it and some who do not. Your Lord best knows the corrupters
  10,41,"If they deny you, say, ´I have my actions and you have your actions. You are not responsible for what I do and I am not responsible for what you do.´"
  10,42,Among them there are some who listen to you. But can you make the deaf hear even though they cannot understand
