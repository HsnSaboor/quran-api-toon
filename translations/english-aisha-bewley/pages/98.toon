quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,122,"But as for those who have iman and do right actions, We will admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever and ever. Allah´s promise is true. Whose speech could be truer than Allah´s"
  4,123,It is not a matter of wishful thinking on your part nor of the wishful thinking of the People of the Book. Anyone who does evil will be repaid for it. He will not find any protector or helper besides Allah
  4,124,"Anyone, male or female, who does right actions and is a mumin, will enter the Garden. They will not be wronged by so much as the tiniest speck"
  4,125,"Who could have a better deen than someone who submits himself completely to Allah and is a good-doer, and follows the religion of Ibrahim, a man of pure natural belief? Allah took Ibrahim as an intimate friend"
  4,126,What is in the heavens and in the earth belongs to Allah. Allah encompasses all things
  4,127,"They will ask you for a fatwa about women. Say, ´Allah gives you a fatwa about them; and also what is recited to you in the Book about orphan girls to whom you do not give the inheritance they are owed, while at the same time desiring to marry them; and also about young children who are denied their rights: that you should act justly with respect to orphans.´ Whatever good you do, Allah knows it"
