  46,3,We have not created the heavens and earth and everything between them except with truth and for a set term. But those who are kafir turn away from what they have been warned about
  46,4,"Say: ´Have you thought about those you call upon apart from Allah? Show me what they have created on the earth. Or do they have a partnership in the heavens? Produce a Book for me before this one or a shred of knowledge if you are telling the truth.´"
  46,5,"Who could be further astray than those who call on other things besides Allah, which will not respond to them until the Day of Rising and which are unaware of their prayers"
