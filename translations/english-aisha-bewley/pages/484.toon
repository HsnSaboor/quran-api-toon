quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  42,11,"the Bringer into Being of the heavens and the earth: He has given you mates from among yourselves, and given mates to the livestock, in that way multiplying you. Nothing is like Him. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing"
  42,12,The Keys of the heavens and earth belong to Him. He expands the provision of anyone He wills or restricts it. He has knowledge of all things
  42,13,"He has laid down the same deen for you as He enjoined on Nuh: that which We have revealed to you and which We enjoined on Ibrahim, Musa and ´Isa: ´Establish the deen and do not make divisions in it.´ What you call the idolaters to follow is very hard for them. Allah chooses for Himself anyone He wills and guides to Himself those who turn to Him"
  42,14,"They only split up after knowledge came to them, tyrannising one another. And were it not for a prior decree from your Lord for a specified term, the judgement between them would already have been made. Those who inherited the Book after them are indeed in grave doubt about it"
  42,15,"So call and go straight as you have been ordered to. Do not follow their whims and desires but say, ´I have iman in a Book sent down by Allah and I am ordered to be just between you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. We have our actions and you have your actions. There is no debate between us and you. Allah will gather us all together. He is our final destination.´"
