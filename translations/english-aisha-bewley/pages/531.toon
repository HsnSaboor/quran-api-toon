quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  54,50,"Our command is only one word, like the blinking of an eye"
  54,51,We destroyed those of your kind in the past. But is there any rememberer there
  54,52,Everything they did is in the Books
  54,53,"Everything is recorded, big or small"
  54,54,The people who have taqwa will be amid Gardens and Rivers
  54,55,on seats of honour in the presence of an All-Powerful King
  55,1,The All-Merciful
  55,2,taught the Qur´an
  55,3,He created man
  55,4,and taught him clear expression
  55,5,The sun and the moon both run with precision
  55,6,The shrubs and the trees all bow down in prostration
  55,7,He erected heaven and established the balance
  55,8,so that you would not transgress the balance
  55,9,Give just weight — do not skimp in the balance
  55,10,He laid out the earth for all living creatures
  55,11,In it are fruits and date-palms with covered spathes
  55,12,and grains on leafy stems and fragrant herbs
  55,13,So which of your Lord´s blessings do you both then deny
  55,14,He created man from dry earth like baked clay
  55,15,and He created the jinn from a fusion of fire
  55,16,So which of your Lord´s blessings do you both then deny
