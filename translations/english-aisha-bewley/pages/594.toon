quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  89,24,"He will say, ´Oh! If only I had prepared in advance for this life of mine!´"
  89,25,That Day no one will punish as He punishes
  89,26,and no one will shackle as He shackles
  89,27,´O self at rest and at peace
  89,28,"return to your Lord, well-pleasing and well-pleased"
  89,29,Enter among My slaves
  89,30,Enter My Garden.´
  90,1,I swear by this city —
  90,2,and you are resident in this city —
  90,3,and by a father and what he fathered
  90,4,We created man in trouble
  90,5,Does he imagine that no one has power over him
  90,6,"He says, ´I have consumed vast quantities of wealth.´"
  90,7,Does he imagine that no one has seen him
  90,8,Have We not given him two eyes
  90,9,and a tongue and two lips
  90,10,and shown him the two highways
  90,11,But he has not braved the steep ascent
  90,12,What will convey to you what the steep ascent is
  90,13,It is freeing a slave
  90,14,or feeding on a day of hunger
  90,15,an orphaned relative
  90,16,or a poor man in the dust
  90,17,then to be one of those who have iman and urge each other to steadfastness and urge each other to compassion
  90,18,Those are the Companions of the Right
  90,19,"Those who reject Our signs, they are the Companions of the Left"
  90,20,Above them is a sealed vault of Fire
