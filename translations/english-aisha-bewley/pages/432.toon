quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,32,"Those deemed great will say to those deemed weak, ´Did we debar you from the guidance when it came to you? No, it is you who were evildoers.´"
  34,33,"Those deemed weak will say to those deemed great, ´No, it was your scheming night and day when you commanded us to reject Allah and assign equals to Him.´ But they will show their remorse when they see the punishment. We will put iron collars round the necks of those who are kafir. Will they be repaid for anything but what they did"
  34,34,"We never sent a warner into any city without the affluent people in it saying, ´We reject what you have been sent with.´"
  34,35,"They also said, ´We have more wealth and children. We are not going to be punished.´"
  34,36,"Say: ´My Lord expands the provision of anyone He wills or restricts it. But the majority of mankind do not know it.´"
  34,37,It is not your wealth or your children that will bring you near to Us — only in the case of people who have iman and act rightly; such people will have a double recompense for what they did. They will be safe from all harm in the High Halls of Paradise
  34,38,"But people who strive against Our Signs, trying to nullify them, such people will be summoned to the punishment"
  34,39,"Say: ´My Lord expands the provision of any of His slaves He wills or restricts it. But anything you expend will be replaced by Him. He is the Best of Providers.´"
