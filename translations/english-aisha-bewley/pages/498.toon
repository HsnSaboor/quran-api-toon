quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  44,40,The Day of Decision will be their appointment all together
  44,41,"the Day when friends will be of no use at all to one another, and they will not be helped —"
  44,42,"except for those Allah has mercy on. He is the Almighty, the Most Merciful"
  44,43,The Tree of az-Zaqqum
  44,44,is the food of the wicked
  44,45,seething in the belly like molten brass
  44,46,as boiling water bubbles and seethes
  44,47,´Seize him and drag him bodily into the middle of the Blazing Fire
  44,48,Then pour the punishment of boiling water on his head.´
  44,49,"´Taste that! You are the mighty one, the noble one"
  44,50,This is the very thing you used to doubt.´
  44,51,The people who have taqwa will be in a safe place
  44,52,amid gardens and fountains
  44,53,"wearing fine silk and rich brocade, face to face with one another"
  44,54,So it will be. We will marry them to dark-eyed maidens
  44,55,"They will call there for fruit of every kind, in complete security"
  44,56,They will not taste any death there — except for the first one. He will safeguard them from the punishment of the Blazing Fire
  44,57,A favour from your Lord. That is the Great Victory
  44,58,We have made it easy in your own tongue so that hopefully they will pay heed
  44,59,So watch and wait. They too are waiting
