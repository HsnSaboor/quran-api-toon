quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  85,1,By Heaven with its Houses of the Zodiac
  85,2,and the Promised Day
  85,3,and the witness and the witnessed
  85,4,cursed be the Companions of the Pit —
  85,5,the fire well stocked with fuel —
  85,6,when they were seated right beside it
  85,7,witnessing what they did to the muminun
  85,8,"The only reason they punished them was because they had iman in Allah, the Almighty, the All-Praiseworthy —"
  85,9,Him to whom the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs. Allah is Witness of all things
  85,10,"Those who persecute men and women of the muminun, and then do not make tawba, will have the punishment of Hell, will have the punishment of the Burning"
  85,11,But those who have iman and do right actions will have Gardens with rivers flowing under them. That is the Great Victory
  85,12,Your Lord´s Assault is very fierce indeed
  85,13,He originates and regenerates
  85,14,"He is the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Loving"
  85,15,"the Possessor of the Throne, the All-Glorious"
  85,16,the Doer of whatever He desires
  85,17,Has the story reached you of the legions
  85,18,of Pharaoh and Thamud
  85,19,Yet those who are kafir insist on their denial
  85,20,while Allah is encircling them from behind
  85,21,It is indeed a Glorious Qur´an
  85,22,preserved on a Tablet
