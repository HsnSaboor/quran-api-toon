quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,171,"People of the Book! do not go to excess in your deen. Say nothing but the truth about Allah. The Messiah, ´Isa son of Maryam, was only the Messenger of Allah and His Word, which He cast into Maryam, and a Spirit from Him. So have iman in Allah and His Messengers. Do not say, ´Three.´ It is better that you stop. Allah is only One God. He is too Glorious to have a son! Everything in the heavens and in the earth belongs to Him. Allah suffices as a Guardian"
  4,172,"The Messiah would never disdain to be a slave to Allah nor would the angels near to Him. If any do disdain to worship Him, and grow arrogant, He will in any case gather them all to Him"
  4,173,"As for those who have iman and do right actions, He will pay them their wages in full and will give them increase from His favour. As for those who show disdain and grow arrogant, He will punish them with a painful punishment. They will not find any protector or helper for themselves besides Allah"
  4,174,Mankind! a clear proof has come to you from your Lord. We have sent down a Clear Light to you
  4,175,"As for those who have iman in Allah and hold fast to Him, He will admit them into mercy and favour from Him and will guide them to Him on a straight path"
