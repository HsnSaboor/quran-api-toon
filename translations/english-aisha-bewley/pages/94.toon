quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,"Those muminun who stay behind — other than those forced to by necessity — are not the same as those who do jihad in the Way of Allah, sacrificing their wealth and themselves. Allah has given those who do jihad with their wealth and themselves a higher rank than those who stay behind. Allah has promised the Best to both, but Allah has preferred those who do jihad over those who stay behind by an immense reward"
  4,96,"high ranks conferred by Him as well as forgiveness and mercy. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  4,97,"The angels ask those they take while they are wronging themselves, ´What were your circumstances?´ They reply, ´We were oppressed on earth.´ They say, ´Was Allah´s earth not wide enough for you to have made hijra elsewhere in it?´ The shelter of such people will be Hell. What an evil destination"
  4,98,"Except for those men, women and children who really are oppressed and do not have any other possibility and are not guided to any way"
  4,99,"It may well be that Allah will pardon them. Allah is Ever-Pardoning, Ever-Forgiving"
  4,100,"Those who make hijra in the Way of Allah will find many places of refuge on the earth and ample sustenance. If anyone leaves his home, making hijra to Allah and His Messenger, and death catches up with him, it is Allah Who will reward him. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  4,101,"When you are travelling in the land, there is nothing wrong in your shortening your salat if you fear that those who are kafir may harass you. The kuffar are your clear-cut enemies"
