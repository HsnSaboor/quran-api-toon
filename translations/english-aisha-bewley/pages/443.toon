quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,A Sign for them is that We carried their families in the laden ship
  36,42,And We have created for them the like of it in which they sail
  36,43,"If We wished, We could drown them with no one to hear their cry, and then they would not be saved —"
  36,44,"except as an act of mercy from Us, to give them enjoyment for a time"
  36,45,"They are told, ´Have taqwa of what is before you and behind you so that hopefully you will have mercy shown to you.´"
  36,46,Not one of your Lord´s Signs comes to them without their turning away from it
  36,47,"And when they are told, ´Spend from the provision Allah has given you,´ those who are kafir say to those who have iman, ´Why should we feed someone whom, if He wished, Allah would feed Himself? You are clearly in error.´"
  36,48,"And they say, ´When will this promise come about if you are telling the truth?´"
  36,49,What are they waiting for but one Great Blast to seize them while they are quibbling
  36,50,They will not be able to make a will or return to their families
  36,51,The Trumpet will be blown and at once they will be sliding from their graves towards their Lord
  36,52,"They will say, ´Alas for us! Who has raised us from our resting-place? This is what the All-Merciful promised us. The Messengers were telling the truth.´"
  36,53,"It will be but one Great Blast, and they will all be summoned to Our presence"
  36,54,Today no self will be wronged in any way. You will only be repaid for what you did
