  9,24,"Say: ´If your fathers or your sons or your brothers or your wives or your tribe, or any wealth you have acquired, or any business you fear may slump, or any house which pleases you, are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger and doing jihad in His Way, then wait until Allah brings about His command. Allah does not guide people who are deviators.´"

  9,26,"Then Allah sent down His serenity on His Messenger and on the muminun, and sent down troops you could not see, and punished those who were kafir. That is how the kuffar are repaid"
