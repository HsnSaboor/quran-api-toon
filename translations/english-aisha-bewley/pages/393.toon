quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  28,60,Anything you have been given is only the enjoyment of the life of this world and its finery. What is with Allah is better and longer lasting. So will you not use your intellect
  28,61,"Is someone whom We have promised good and who then obtains it, the same as someone whom We have given enjoyment in the life of the dunya and who then, on the Day of Rising, is one of those brought to punishment"
  28,62,"On the Day when He summons them He will say, ´Where are they, those you claimed were My associates?´"
  28,63,"Those against whom the Word has been justly carried out will say, ´Our Lord, those people we misled, we only misled them as we too were misled. We declare our innocence to You. It was not us they were worshipping!´"
  28,64,"They will be told, ´Call on your partner-gods!´ They will call on them but they will not respond to them. They will see the punishment. Oh if only they had been guided"
  28,65,"On the Day when He summons them He will say, ´How did you respond to the Messengers?´"
  28,66,That Day the facts will be unclear to them and they will not be able to question one another
  28,67,"But as for those who make tawba and believe and act rightly, they will hopefully be successful"
  28,68,Your Lord creates and chooses whatever He wills. The choice is not theirs. Glory be to Allah! He is exalted above anything they associate with Him
  28,69,Your Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they divulge
  28,70,He is Allah. There is no god but Him. Praise be to Him in the dunya and the akhira. Judgement belongs to Him. You will be returned to Him
