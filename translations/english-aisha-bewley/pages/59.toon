quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,71,People of the Book! why do you mix truth with falsehood and knowingly conceal the truth
  3,72,"A group of the People of the Book say, ´At the beginning of the day, you should claim to have iman in what was sent down to those who have iman, and then at the end of the day, you should reject it, so that hopefully they will revert"
  3,73,"Do not trust anyone except for those who follow your deen.´ Say, ´Allah´s guidance is true guidance. But you think it is impossible for anyone to be given the same as you were given, or to argue with you before your Lord.´ Say, ´All favour is in Allah´s Hand and He gives it to whoever He wills. Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing"
  3,74,He picks out for His mercy whoever He wills. Allah´s favour is indeed immense.´
  3,75,"Among the People of the Book there are some who, if you entrust them with a pile of gold, will return it to you. But there are others among them who, if you entrust them with just a single dinar, will not return it to you, unless you stay standing over them. That is because they say, ´We are under no obligation where the gentiles are concerned.´ They tell a lie against Allah and they know it"
  3,76,"No, the truth is, if people honour their contracts and have taqwa of Him, Allah loves those who have taqwa"
  3,77,"Those who sell Allah´s contract and their own oaths for a paltry price, such people will have no portion in the Next World, and on the Day of Rising Allah will not speak to them or look at them or purify them. They will have a painful punishment"
