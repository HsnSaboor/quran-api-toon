quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star when it descends
  53,2,your companion is not misguided or misled
  53,3,nor does he speak from whim
  53,4,It is nothing but Revelation revealed
  53,5,taught him by one immensely strong
  53,6,possessing power and splendour. He stood there stationary —
  53,7,there on the highest horizon
  53,8,Then he drew near and hung suspended
  53,9,He was two bow-lengths away or even closer
  53,10,Then He revealed to His slave what He revealed
  53,11,His heart did not lie about what he saw
  53,12,What! Do you dispute with him about what he saw
  53,13,He saw him again another time
  53,14,by the Lote-tree of the Final Limit
  53,15,beside which is the Garden of Refuge
  53,16,when that which covered the Lote-tree covered it
  53,17,His eye did not waver nor did he look away
  53,18,He saw some of the Greatest Signs of his Lord
  53,19,Have you really considered al-Lat and al-´Uzza
  53,20,"and Manat, the third, the other one"
  53,21,Do you have males and He females
  53,22,That is a most unfair division
  53,23,"They are nothing but names which you yourselves have given, you and your forefathers. Allah has sent down no authority for them. They are following nothing but conjecture and what their own selves desire. And that when guidance has reached them from their Lord"
  53,24,Shall man then have whatever he covets
  53,25,The last and the first belong to Allah
  53,26,And how many angels there are in the heavens whose intercession is of no benefit at all until Allah has authorised those He wills and is pleased with them
