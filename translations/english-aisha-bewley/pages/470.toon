quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,26,"Pharaoh said, ´Let me kill Musa and let him call upon his Lord! I am afraid that he may change your deen and bring about corruption in the land.´"
  40,27,"Musa said, ´I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every proud man who does not have iman in the Day of Reckoning.´"
  40,28,"A man among Pharaoh´s people who had iman, but kept his iman concealed, said, ´Are you going to kill a man for saying \"My Lord is Allah\" when he has brought you Clear Signs from your Lord? If he is telling a lie, be it on his own head. But if he is telling the truth, then some of what he is promising you will certainly happen to you. Allah does not guide any unbridled inveterate liar"
  40,29,"My people! the kingdom is yours today, as masters in the land, but who will help us against Allah´s violent force, if it comes upon us?´ Pharoah said, ´I only show you what I see myself and I only guide you to the path of rectitude.´"
  40,30,"The man who had iman said, ´My people! I fear for you a day like that of the Confederates"
  40,31,the same as happened to the people of Nuh and ´Ad and Thamud and those who followed after them. Allah does not want any injustice for His slaves
  40,32,My people! I fear for you the Day of Calling Out
  40,33,"the Day when you will turn your backs in flight, having no one to protect you from Allah. Whoever Allah misguides will have no guide"
