quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,118,"and also towards the three who were left behind,* so that when the earth became narrow for them, for all its great breadth, and their own selves became constricted for them and they realised that there was no refuge from Allah except in Him, He turned to them so that they might turn to Him. Allah is the Ever-Returning, the Most Merciful"
  9,119,You who have iman! have taqwa of Allah and be with the truly sincere
  9,120,"It was not for people of Madina, and the desert arabs around them, to remain behind the Messenger of Allah nor to prefer themselves to him. That is because no thirst or weariness or hunger will afflict them in the Way of Allah, nor will they take a single step to infuriate the kafirun, nor secure any gain from the enemy, without a right action being written down for them because of it. Allah does not let the wage of the good-doers go to waste"
  9,121,"Nor will they give away any amount, whether large or small, nor will they cross any valley, without it being written down for them so that Allah can recompense them for the best of what they did"
  9,122,It is not necessary for the muminun to go out all together. If a party from each group of them were to go out so they could increase their knowledge of the deen they would be able to notify their people when they returned to them so that hopefully they would take warning
