quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,The intercession of the interceders will not help them
  74,49,What is the matter with them that they run from the Reminder
  74,50,like panicked donkeys
  74,51,fleeing from a lion
  74,52,In fact each one of them wants to be given an unfurled scroll
  74,53,No indeed! The truth is they do not fear the Next World
  74,54,No indeed! It is truly a reminder
  74,55,to which anyone who wills may pay heed
  74,56,But they will only pay heed if Allah wills. He is entitled to be feared and entitled to forgive
  75,1,No! I swear by the Day of Rising
  75,2,No! I swear by the self-reproaching self
  75,3,Does man imagine We will not reassemble his bones
  75,4,On the contrary! We are well able to reshape his fingers
  75,5,Yet man still wants to deny what is ahead of him
  75,6,"asking, ´So when is the Day of Rising?´"
  75,7,But when the eyesight is dazzled
  75,8,and the moon is eclipsed
  75,9,and the sun and moon are fused together
  75,10,"on that Day man will say, ´Where can I run?´"
  75,11,No indeed! There will be no safe place
  75,12,That Day the only resting place will be your Lord
  75,13,That Day man will be told what he did and failed to do
  75,14,"In fact, man will be clear proof against himself"
  75,15,in spite of any excuses he might offer
  75,16,Do not move your tongue trying to hasten it
  75,17,Its collection and recitation are Our affair
  75,18,"So when We recite it, follow its recitation"
  75,19,Then its explanation is Our concern
