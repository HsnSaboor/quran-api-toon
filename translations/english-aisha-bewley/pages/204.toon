quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  9,107,"As for those who have set up a mosque, causing harm and out of kufr, to create division between the muminun, and in readiness for those who previously made war on Allah and His Messenger, they will swear, ´We only desired the best.´ But Allah bears witness that they are truly liars"
  9,108,Do not ever stand in it. A mosque founded on taqwa from the first day has a greater right for you to stand in it. In it there are men who love to purify themselves. Allah loves those who purify themselves
  9,109,"Who is better: someone who founds his building on taqwa of Allah and His good pleasure, or someone who founds his building on the brink of a crumbling precipice so that it collapses with him into the Fire of Hell? Allah does not love wrongdoers"
  9,110,"The buildings they have built will not cease to be a bone of contention in their hearts, until their hearts are cut to shreds. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  9,111,"Allah has bought from the muminun their selves and their wealth in return for the Garden. They fight in the Way of Allah and they kill and are killed. It is a promise binding on Him in the Torah, the Injil and the Qur´an and who is truer to his contract than Allah? Rejoice then in the bargain you have made. That is the great victory"
