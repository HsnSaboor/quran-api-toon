quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,220,"on this world and the Next World. They will ask you about the property of orphans. Say, ´Managing it in their best interests is best.´ If you mix your property with theirs, they are your brothers. Allah knows a squanderer from a good manager. If Allah had wanted, He could have been hard on you. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise"
  2,221,"Do not marry women of the idolaters until they have iman. A slavegirl who is one of the muminun is better for you than a woman of the idolaters, even though she may attract you. And do not give (your women) in marriage to men of the mushrikun until they have iman. A slave who is one of the muminun is better for you than a man of the idolaters, even though he may attract you. Such people call you to the Fire whereas Allah calls you, with His permission, to the Garden and forgiveness. He makes His Signs clear to people so that hopefully they will pay heed"
  2,222,"They will ask you about menstruation. Say, ´It is an impurity, so keep apart from women during menstruation and do not approach them until they have purified themselves. But once they have purified themselves, then go to them in the way that Allah has enjoined on you.´ Allah loves those who turn back from wrongdoing and He loves those who purify themselves"
  2,223,"Your women are fertile fields for you, so come to your fertile fields however you like. Send good ahead for yourselves and have taqwa of Allah. Know that you are going to meet Him. And give good news to the muminun"
  2,224,"Do not, by your oaths, make Allah a pretext to avoid good action and having taqwa and putting things right between people. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
