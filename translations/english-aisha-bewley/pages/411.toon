quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  31,1,Alif Lam Mim
  31,2,Those are the Signs of the Wise Book —
  31,3,guidance and mercy for the good-doers
  31,4,those who establish salat and pay zakat and are certain of the Next World
  31,5,Such people are following guidance from their Lord. They are the ones who are successful
  31,6,But there are some people who trade in distracting tales to misguide people from Allah´s Way knowing nothing about it and to make a mockery of it. Such people will have a humiliating punishment
  31,7,"When Our Signs are recited to such a person, he turns away arrogantly as if he had not heard, as if there was a great weight in his ears. So give him news of a painful punishment"
  31,8,For those who have iman and do right actions there are Gardens of Delight
  31,9,"to remain in them timelessly, for ever. Allah´s promise is true. He is the Almighty, the All-Wise"
  31,10,"It is Allah Who created the heavens with no support — you can see them — and cast firmly embedded mountains on the earth so that it would not move under you, and scattered about in it creatures of every kind. And We send down water from the sky and make every generous species grow in it"
  31,11,This is Allah´s creation. Show me then what those besides Him have created! The wrongdoers are clearly misguided
