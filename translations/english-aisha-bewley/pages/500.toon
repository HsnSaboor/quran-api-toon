  45,17,"We made the Commandments very clear to them and they only differed after knowledge came to them, tyrannising one other. Your Lord will decide between them on the Day of Rising regarding the things they differed about"
  45,18,"Then We placed you on the right road of Our Command, so follow it. Do not follow the whims and desires of those who do not know"
