quran[22]{c,v,t}:
  38,62,"They will say, ´How is it that we do not see some men whom we used to count among the worst of people"
  38,63,Did we turn them into figures of fun? Did our eyes disdain to look at them?´
  38,64,All this is certainly true — the bickering of the people of the Fire
  38,65,"Say: ´I am only a warner. There is no god except Allah, the One, the All-Conquering"
  38,66,"Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything between them, the Almighty, the Endlessly Forgiving.´"
  38,67,"Say: ´This is momentous news"
  38,68,yet you ignore it
  38,69,I knew nothing of the Highest Assembly when they debated
  38,70,It is only revealed to me that I am a clear warner.´
  38,71,"Your Lord said to the angels, ´I am going to create a human being out of clay"
  38,72,"When I have formed him and breathed My Ruh into him, fall down in prostration to him!´"
  38,73,"So the angels prostrated, all of them together"
  38,74,except for Iblis who was arrogant and was one of the kafirun
  38,75,"He said, ´Iblis, what prevented you prostrating to what I created with My own Hands? Were you overcome by arrogance or are you one of the exalted?´"
  38,76,"He said, ´I am better than him. You created me from fire but You created him from clay.´"

  38,78,My curse is upon you until the Day of Reckoning.´
  38,79,"He said, ´My Lord, grant me a reprieve until the Day they are raised again.´"
