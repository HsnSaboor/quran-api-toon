quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  67,1,Blessed be He who has the Kingdom in His Hand! He has power over all things
  67,2,"He who created death and life to test which of you is best in action. He is the Almighty, the Ever-Forgiving"
  67,3,He who created the seven heavens in layers. You will not find any flaw in the creation of the All-Merciful. Look again — do you see any gaps
  67,4,Then look again and again. Your sight will return to you dazzled and exhausted
  67,5,We have adorned the lowest heaven with lamps and made some of them stones for the shaytans for whom We have prepared the punishment of the Blaze
  67,6,Those who reject their Lord will have the punishment of Hell. What an evil destination
  67,7,When they are flung into it they will hear it gasping harshly as it seethes
  67,8,"It all but bursts with rage. Each time a group is flung into it its custodians will question them: ´Did no warner come to you?´"
  67,9,"They will say, ´Yes indeed, a warner did come to us but we denied him and said, \"Allah has sent nothing down. You are just greatly misguided.\"´"
  67,10,"They will say, ´If only we had really listened and used our intellect, we would not have been Companions of the Blaze.´"
  67,11,Then they will acknowledge their wrong actions. Away with the Companions of the Blaze
  67,12,Those who fear their Lord in the Unseen will have forgiveness and an immense reward
