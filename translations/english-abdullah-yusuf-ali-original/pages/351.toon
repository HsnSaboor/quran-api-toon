quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,11,"Those who brought forward the lie are a body among yourselves: think it not to be an evil to you; On the contrary it is good for you: to every man among them (will come the punishment) of the sin that he earned, and to him who took on himself the lead among them, will be a penalty grievous"
  24,12,"Why did not the believers - men and women - when ye heard of the affair,- put the best construction on it in their own minds and say, \"This (charge) is an obvious lie"
  24,13,"Why did they not bring four witnesses to prove it? When they have not brought the witnesses, such men, in the sight of God, (stand forth) themselves as liars"
  24,14,"Were it not for the grace and mercy of God on you, in this world and the Hereafter, a grievous penalty would have seized you in that ye rushed glibly into this affair"
  24,15,"Behold, ye received it on your tongues, and said out of your mouths things of which ye had no knowledge; and ye thought it to be a light matter, while it was most serious in the sight of God"
  24,16,"And why did ye not, when ye heard it, say? - \"It is not right of us to speak of this: Glory to God! this is a most serious slander"
  24,17,"God doth admonish you, that ye may never repeat such (conduct), if ye are (true) Believers"
  24,18,"And God makes the Signs plain to you: for God is full of knowledge and wisdom"
  24,19,"Those who love (to see) scandal published broadcast among the Believers, will have a grievous Penalty in this life and in the Hereafter: God knows, and ye know not"
  24,20,"Were it not for the grace and mercy of God on you, and that God is full of kindness and mercy, (ye would be ruined indeed)"
