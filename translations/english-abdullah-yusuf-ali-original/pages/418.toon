quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  33,1,"O Prophet! Fear God, and hearken not to the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites: verily God is full of Knowledge and Wisdom"
  33,2,"But follow that which comes to thee by inspiration from thy Lord: for God is well acquainted with (all) that ye do"
  33,3,"And put thy trust in God, and enough is God as a disposer of affairs"
  33,4,"God has not made for any man two hearts in his (one) body: nor has He made your wives whom ye divorce by Zihar your mothers: nor has He made your adopted sons your sons. Such is (only) your (manner of) speech by your mouths. But God tells (you ) the Truth, and He shows the (right) Way"
  33,5,"Call them by (the names of) their fathers: that is juster in the sight of God. But if ye know not their father's (names, call them) your Brothers in faith, or your maulas. But there is no blame on you if ye make a mistake therein: (what counts is) the intention of your hearts: and God is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful"
  33,6,"The Prophet is closer to the Believers than their own selves, and his wives are their mothers. Blood-relations among each other have closer personal ties, in the Decree of God. Than (the Brotherhood of) Believers and Muhajirs: nevertheless do y e what is just to your closest friends: such is the writing in the Decree (of God)"
