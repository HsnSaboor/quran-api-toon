  25,56,But thee We only sent to give glad tidings and admonition
  25,57,"Say: \"No reward do I ask of you for it but this: that each one who will may take a (straight) Path to his Lord"
  25,58,And put thy trust in Him Who lives and dies not; and celebrate his praise; and enough is He to be acquainted with the faults of His servants
  25,59,"He Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between, in six days, and is firmly established on the Throne (of Authority): God Most Gracious: ask thou, then, about Him of any acquainted (with such things)"
  25,60,"When it is said to them, \"Adore ye (God) Most Gracious!\", they say, \"And what is (God) Most Gracious? Shall we adore that which thou commandest us?\" And it increases their flight (from the Truth)"
  25,61,"Blessed is He Who made constellations in the skies, and placed therein a Lamp and a Moon giving light"
  25,62,"And it is He Who made the Night and the Day to follow each other: for such as have the will to celebrate His praises or to show their gratitude"
  25,63,"And the servants of (God) Most Gracious are those who walk on the earth in humility, and when the ignorant address them, they say, \"Peace"
  25,64,Those who spend the night in adoration of their Lord prostrate and standing
  25,65,"Those who say, \"Our Lord! avert from us the Wrath of Hell, for its Wrath is indeed an affliction grievous"
  25,66,"Evil indeed is it as an abode, and as a place to rest in"
  25,67,"Those who, when they spend, are not extravagant and not niggardly, but hold a just (balance) between those (extremes)"
