  72,15,"But those who swerve,- they are (but) fuel for Hell-fire"
  72,16,"(And God's Message is): \"If they (the Pagans) had (only) remained on the (right) Way, We should certainly have bestowed on them Rain in abundance"
  72,17,"That We might try them by that (means). But if any turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, He will cause him to undergo a severe Penalty"
  72,18,"And the places of worship are for God (alone): So invoke not any one along with God"
  72,19,"Yet when the Devotee of God stands forth to invoke Him, they just make round him a dense crowd"
  72,20,"Say: \"I do no more than invoke my Lord, and I join not with Him any (false god)"
  72,21,"Say: \"It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to right conduct"
  72,22,"Say: \"No one can deliver me from God (If I were to disobey Him), nor should I find refuge except in Him"

  72,26,"He (alone) knows the Unseen, nor does He make any one acquainted with His Mysteries"

  72,28,"That He may know that they have (truly) brought and delivered the Messages of their Lord: and He surrounds (all the mysteries) that are with them, and takes account of every single thing"
