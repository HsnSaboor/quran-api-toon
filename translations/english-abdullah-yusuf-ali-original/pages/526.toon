quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the Star when it goes down
  53,2,Your Companion is neither astray nor being misled
  53,3,Nor does he say (aught) of (his own) Desire
  53,4,It is no less than inspiration sent down to him
  53,5,He was taught by one Mighty in Power
  53,6,"Endued with Wisdom: for he appeared (in stately form)"
  53,7,While he was in the highest part of the horizon
  53,8,Then he approached and came closer
  53,9,And was at a distance of but two bow-lengths or (even) nearer
  53,10,So did (God) convey the inspiration to His Servant- (conveyed) what He (meant) to convey
  53,11,The (Prophet's) (mind and) heart in no way falsified that which he saw
  53,12,Will ye then dispute with him concerning what he saw
  53,13,For indeed he saw him at a second descent
  53,14,Near the Lote-tree beyond which none may pass
  53,15,Near it is the Garden of Abode
  53,16,"Behold, the Lote-tree was shrouded (in mystery unspeakable)"
  53,17,"(His) sight never swerved, nor did it go wrong"
  53,18,"For truly did he see, of the Signs of his Lord, the Greatest"
  53,19,Have ye seen Lat. and 'Uzza
  53,20,"And another, the third (goddess), Manat"
  53,21,"What! for you the male sex, and for Him, the female"
  53,22,"Behold, such would be indeed a division most unfair"
  53,23,"These are nothing but names which ye have devised,- ye and your fathers,- for which God has sent down no authority (whatever). They follow nothing but conjecture and what their own souls desire!- Even though there has already come to them Guid ance from their Lord"
  53,24,"Nay, shall man have (just) anything he hankers after"
  53,25,But it is to God that the End and the Beginning (of all things) belong
  53,26,"How many-so-ever be the angels in the heavens, their intercession will avail nothing except after God has given leave for whom He pleases and that he is acceptable to Him"
