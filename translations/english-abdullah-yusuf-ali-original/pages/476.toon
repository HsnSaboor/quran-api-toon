quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,78,"We did aforetime send apostles before thee: of them there are some whose story We have related to thee, and some whose story We have not related to thee. It was not (possible) for any apostle to bring a sign except by the leave of God: but whe n the Command of God issued, the matter was decided in truth and justice, and there perished, there and then those who stood on Falsehoods"
  40,79,"It is God Who made cattle for you, that ye may use some for riding and some for food"
  40,80,And there are (other) advantages in them for you (besides); that ye may through them attain to any need (there may be) in your hearts; and on them and on ships ye are carried
  40,81,"And He shows you (always) His Signs: then which of the Signs of God will ye deny"
  40,82,"Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them? They were more numerous than these and superior in strength and in the traces (they have left) in the land: Yet all that they accomplished was of no profit to them"
  40,83,"For when their apostles came to them with Clear Signs, they exulted in such knowledge (and skill) as they had; but that very (Wrath) at which they were wont to scoff hemmed them in"
  40,84,"But when they saw Our Punishment, they said: \"We believe in God,- the one God - and we reject the partners we used to join with Him"
  40,85,But their professing the Faith when they (actually) saw Our Punishment was not going to profit them. (Such has been) God's Way of dealing with His Servants (from the most ancient times). And even thus did the Rejecters of God perish (utterly)
