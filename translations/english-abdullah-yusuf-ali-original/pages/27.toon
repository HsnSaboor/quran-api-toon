quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,177,"It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces Towards east or West; but it is righteousness- to believe in God and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and practice regular charity; to fulfil the contracts which ye have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or suffering) and dversity, and throughout all periods of panic. Such are the people of truth, the God-fearing"
  2,178,"O ye who believe! the law of equality is prescribed to you in cases of murder: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the woman for the woman. But if any remission is made by the brother of the slain, then grant any reasonable demand, and compensate him with handsome gratitude, this is a concession and a Mercy from your Lord. After this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave penalty"
  2,179,"In the Law of Equality there is (saving of) Life to you, o ye men of understanding; that ye may restrain yourselves"
  2,180,"It is prescribed, when death approaches any of you, if he leave any goods that he make a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to reasonable usage; this is due from the God-fearing"
  2,181,"If anyone changes the bequest after hearing it, the guilt shall be on those who make the change. For God hears and knows (All things)"
