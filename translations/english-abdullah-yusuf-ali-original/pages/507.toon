quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"Those who reject God and hinder (men) from the Path of God,- their deeds will God render astray (from their mark)"
  47,2,"But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, and believe in the (Revelation) sent down to Muhammad - for it is the Truth from their Lord,- He will remove from them their ills and improve their condition"
  47,3,"This because those who reject God follow vanities, while those who believe follow the Truth from their Lord: Thus does God set forth for men their lessons by similitudes"
  47,4,"Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight), smite at their necks; At length, when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond firmly (on them): thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: Until the war lays down its burd ens. Thus (are ye commanded): but if it had been God's Will, He could certainly have exacted retribution from them (Himself); but (He lets you fight) in order to test you, some with others. But those who are slain in the Way of God,- He will never let their deeds be lost"
  47,5,Soon will He guide them and improve their condition
  47,6,And admit them to the Garden which He has announced for them
  47,7,"O ye who believe! If ye will aid (the cause of) God, He will aid you, and plant your feet firmly"
  47,8,"But those who reject (God),- for them is destruction, and (God) will render their deeds astray (from their mark)"
  47,9,That is because they hate the Revelation of God; so He has made their deeds fruitless
  47,10,"Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the End of those before them (who did evil)? God brought utter destruction on them, and similar (fates await) those who reject God"
  47,11,"That is because God is the Protector of those who believe, but those who reject God have no protector"
