quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,109,"To God belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: To Him do all questions go back (for decision)"
  3,110,"Ye are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind, enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, and believing in God. If only the People of the Book had faith, it were best for them: among them are some who have faith, but most of them are perverted transgressors"
  3,111,"They will do you no harm, barring a trifling annoyance; if they come out to fight you, they will show you their backs, and no help shall they get"
  3,112,"Shame is pitched over them (Like a tent) wherever they are found, except when under a covenant (of protection) from God and from men; they draw on themselves wrath from God, and pitched over them is (the tent of) destitution. This because they rejected the Signs of God, and slew the prophets in defiance of right; this because they rebelled and transgressed beyond bounds"
  3,113,"Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book are a portion that stand (For the right): They rehearse the Signs of God all night long, and they prostrate themselves in adoration"
  3,114,"They believe in God and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all) good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous"
  3,115,"Of the good that they do, nothing will be rejected of them; for God knoweth well those that do right"
