quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,Concerning what are they disputing
  78,2,Concerning the Great News
  78,3,About which they cannot agree
  78,4,"Verily, they shall soon (come to) know"
  78,5,"Verily, verily they shall soon (come to) know"
  78,6,Have We not made the earth as a wide expanse
  78,7,And the mountains as pegs
  78,8,And (have We not) created you in pairs
  78,9,And made your sleep for rest
  78,10,And made the night as a covering
  78,11,And made the day as a means of subsistence
  78,12,And (have We not) built over you the seven firmaments
  78,13,And placed (therein) a Light of Splendour
  78,14,And do We not send down from the clouds water in abundance
  78,15,That We may produce therewith corn and vegetables
  78,16,And gardens of luxurious growth
  78,17,Verily the Day of Sorting out is a thing appointed
  78,18,"The Day that the Trumpet shall be sounded, and ye shall come forth in crowds"
  78,19,And the heavens shall be opened as if there were doors
  78,20,"And the mountains shall vanish, as if they were a mirage"
  78,21,Truly Hell is as a place of ambush
  78,22,For the transgressors a place of destination
  78,23,They will dwell therein for ages
  78,24,"Nothing cool shall they taste therein, nor any drink"
  78,25,"Save a boiling fluid and a fluid, dark, murky, intensely cold"
  78,26,A fitting recompense (for them)
  78,27,For that they used not to fear any account (for their deeds)
  78,28,But they (impudently) treated Our Signs as false
  78,29,And all things have We preserved on record
  78,30,"So taste ye (the fruits of your deeds); for no increase shall We grant you, except in Punishment"
