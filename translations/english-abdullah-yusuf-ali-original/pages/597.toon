quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the Fig and the Olive
  95,2,And the Mount of Sinai
  95,3,And this City of security
  95,4,We have indeed created man in the best of moulds
  95,5,Then do We abase him (to be) the lowest of the low
  95,6,"Except such as believe and do righteous deeds: For they shall have a reward unfailing"
  95,7,"Then what can, after this, contradict thee, as to the judgment (to come)"
  95,8,Is not God the wisest of judges
  96,1,"Proclaim! (or read!) in the name of thy Lord and Cherisher, Who created"
  96,2,"Created man, out of a (mere) clot of congealed blood"
  96,3,Proclaim! And thy Lord is Most Bountiful
  96,4,He Who taught (the use of) the pen
  96,5,Taught man that which he knew not
  96,6,"Day, but man doth transgress all bounds"
  96,7,In that he looketh upon himself as self-sufficient
  96,8,"Verily, to thy Lord is the return (of all)"
  96,9,Seest thou one who forbids
  96,10,A votary when he (turns) to pray
  96,11,Seest thou if he is on (the road of) Guidance
  96,12,Or enjoins Righteousness
  96,13,Seest thou if he denies (Truth) and turns away
  96,14,Knoweth he not that God doth see
  96,15,"Let him beware! If he desist not, We will drag him by the forelock"
  96,16,"A lying, sinful forelock"
  96,17,"Then, let him call (for help) to his council (of comrades)"
  96,18,We will call on the angels of punishment (to deal with him)
  96,19,"Day, heed him not: But bow down in adoration, and bring thyself the closer (to God)"
