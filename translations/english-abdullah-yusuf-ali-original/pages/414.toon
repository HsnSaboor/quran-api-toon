  31,30,"That is because God is the (only) Reality, and because whatever else they invoke besides Him is Falsehood; and because God,- He is the Most High, Most Great"
  31,31,Seest thou not that the ships sail through the ocean by the Grace of God?- that He may show you of His Signs? Verily in this are Signs for all who constantly persevere and give thanks
  31,32,"When a wave covers them like the canopy (of clouds), they call to God, offering Him sincere devotion. But when He has delivered them safely to land, there are among them those that halt between (right and wrong). But none reject Our Signs exce pt only a perfidious ungrateful (wretch)"
  31,33,"O mankind! do your duty to your Lord, and fear (the coming of) a Day when no father can avail aught for his son, nor a son avail aught for his father. Verily, the promise of God is true: let not then this present life deceive you, nor let the c hief Deceiver deceive you about God"
  31,34,"Verily the knowledge of the Hour is with God (alone). It is He Who sends down rain, and He Who knows what is in the wombs.
