  4,129,"Ye are never able to be fair and just as between women, even if it is your ardent desire: But turn not away (from a woman) altogether, so as to leave her (as it were) hanging (in the air). If ye come to a friendly understanding, and practise se lf- restraint, God is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful"

  4,132,"Yea, unto God belong all things in the heavens and on earth, and enough is God to carry through all affairs"
