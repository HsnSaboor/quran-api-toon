quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,181,"God hath heard the taunt of those who say: \"Truly, God is indigent and we are rich!\"- We shall certainly record their word and (their act) of slaying the prophets in defiance of right, and We shall say: \"Taste ye the penalty of the Scorching Fi re"
  3,182,"This is because of the (unrighteous deeds) which your hands sent on before ye: For God never harms those who serve Him"
  3,183,"They (also) said: \"God took our promise not to believe in an apostle unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire (From heaven).\" Say: \"There came to you apostles before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: why then did ye s lay them, if ye speak the truth"
  3,184,"Then if they reject thee, so were rejected apostles before thee, who came with Clear Signs, Books of dark prophecies, and the Book of Enlightenment"
  3,185,"Every soul shall have a taste of death: And only on the Day of Judgment shall you be paid your full recompense. Only he who is saved far from the Fire and admitted to the Garden will have attained the object (of Life): For the life of this wor ld is but goods and chattels of deception"
  3,186,"Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves; and ye shall certainly Hear much that will grieve you, from those who received the Book before you and from those who worship many gods. But if ye persever e patiently, and guard against evil,-then that will be a determining factor in all affairs"
