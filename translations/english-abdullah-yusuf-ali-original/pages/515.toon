quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  48,29,"Muhammad is the apostle of God; and those who are with him are strong against Unbelievers, (but) compassionate amongst each other. Thou wilt see them bow and prostrate themselves (in prayer), seeking Grace from God and (His) Good Pleasure. On their faces are their marks, (being) the traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Taurat; and their similitude in the Gospel is: like a seed which sends forth its blade, then makes it strong; it then becomes thick, and it stands on its own stem, (filling) the sowers with wonder and delight. As a result, it fills the Unbelievers with rage at them. God has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds forgiveness, and a great Reward"
  49,1,"O Ye who believe! Put not yourselves forward before God and His Apostle; but fear God: for God is He Who hears and knows all things"
  49,2,"O ye who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor speak aloud to him in talk, as ye may speak aloud to one another, lest your deeds become vain and ye perceive not"
  49,3,"Those that lower their voices in the presence of God's Apostle,- their hearts has God tested for piety: for them is Forgiveness and a great Reward"
  49,4,Those who shout out to thee from without the inner apartments - most of them lack understanding
