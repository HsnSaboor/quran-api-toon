quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,103,"So when they had both submitted their wills (to God), and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead (for sacrifice)"
  37,104,"We called out to him \"O Abraham"
  37,105,"Thou hast already fulfilled the vision!\" - thus indeed do We reward those who do right"
  37,106,For this was obviously a trial
  37,107,And We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice
  37,108,And We left (this blessing) for him among generations (to come) in later times
  37,109,Peace and salutation to Abraham
  37,110,Thus indeed do We reward those who do right
  37,111,For he was one of our believing Servants
  37,112,"And We gave him the good news of Isaac - a prophet,- one of the Righteous"
  37,113,"We blessed him and Isaac: but of their progeny are (some) that do right, and (some) that obviously do wrong, to their own souls"
  37,114,Again (of old) We bestowed Our favour on Moses and Aaron
  37,115,And We delivered them and their people from (their) Great Calamity
  37,116,"And We helped them, so they overcame (their troubles)"
  37,117,And We gave them the Book which helps to make things clear
  37,118,And We guided them to the Straight Way
  37,119,And We left (this blessing) for them among generations (to come) in later times
  37,120,Peace and salutation to Moses and Aaron
  37,121,Thus indeed do We reward those who do right
  37,122,For they were two of our believing Servants
  37,123,So also was Elias among those sent (by Us)
  37,124,"Behold, he said to his people, \"Will ye not fear (God)"
  37,125,Will ye call upon Baal and forsake the Best of Creators
  37,126,"God, your Lord and Cherisher and the Lord and Cherisher of your fathers of old"
