quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,275,"Those who devour usury will not stand except as stand one whom the Evil one by his touch Hath driven to madness. That is because they say: \"Trade is like usury,\" but God hath permitted trade and forbidden usury. Those who after receiving direc tion from their Lord, desist, shall be pardoned for the past; their case is for God (to judge); but those who repeat (The offence) are companions of the Fire: They will abide therein (for ever)"
  2,276,"God will deprive usury of all blessing, but will give increase for deeds of charity: For He loveth not creatures ungrateful and wicked"
  2,277,"Those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and establish regular prayers and regular charity, will have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve"
  2,278,"O ye who believe! Fear God, and give up what remains of your demand for usury, if ye are indeed believers"
  2,279,"If ye do it not, Take notice of war from God and His Apostle: But if ye turn back, ye shall have your capital sums: Deal not unjustly, and ye shall not be dealt with unjustly"
  2,280,"If the debtor is in a difficulty, grant him time Till it is easy for him to repay. But if ye remit it by way of charity, that is best for you if ye only knew"
  2,281,"And fear the Day when ye shall be brought back to God. Then shall every soul be paid what it earned, and none shall be dealt with unjustly"
