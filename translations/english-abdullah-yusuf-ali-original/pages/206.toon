  9,118,"(He turned in mercy also) to the three who were left behind; (they felt guilty) to such a degree that the earth seemed constrained to them, for all its spaciousness, and their (very) souls seemed straitened to them,- and they perceived that th ere is no fleeing from God (and no refuge) but to Himself. Then He turned to them, that they might repent: for God is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful"
  9,119,O ye who believe! Fear God and be with those who are true (in word and deed)

  9,121,"Nor could they spend anything (for the cause) - small or great- nor cut across a valley, but the deed is inscribed to their credit: that God may requite their deed with the best (possible reward)"
  9,122,"Nor should the Believers all go forth together: if a contingent from every expedition remained behind, they could devote themselves to studies in religion, and admonish the people when they return to them,- that thus they (may learn) to guard themselves (against evil)"
