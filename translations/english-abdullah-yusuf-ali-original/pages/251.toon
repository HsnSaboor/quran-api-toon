quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  13,14,"For Him (alone) is prayer in Truth: any others that they call upon besides Him hear them no more than if they were to stretch forth their hands for water to reach their mouths but it reaches them not: for the prayer of those without Faith is n othing but (futile) wandering (in the mind)"
  13,15,"Whatever beings there are in the heavens and the earth do prostrate themselves to God (Acknowledging subjection),- with good-will or in spite of themselves: so do their shadows in the morning and evenings"
  13,16,"Say: \"Who is the Lord and Sustainer of the heavens and the earth?\" Say: \"(It is) God.\" Say: \"Do ye then take (for worship) protectors other than Him, such as have no power either for good or for harm to themselves?\" Say: \"Are the blind equal wi th those who see? Or the depths of darkness equal with light?\" Or do they assign to God partners who have created (anything) as He has created, so that the creation seemed to them similar? Say: \"God is the Creator of all things: He is the One, the Supr eme and Irresistible"
  13,17,"He sends down water from the skies, and the channels flow, each according to its measure: But the torrent bears away to foam that mounts up to the surface. Even so, from that (ore) which they heat in the fire, to make ornaments or utensils the rewith, there is a scum likewise. Thus doth God (by parables) show forth Truth and Vanity. For the scum disappears like froth cast out; while that which is for the good of mankind remains on the earth. Thus doth God set forth parables"
  13,18,"For those who respond to their Lord, are (all) good things. But those who respond not to Him,- Even if they had all that is in the heavens and on earth, and as much more, (in vain) would they offer it for ransom. For them will the reckoning be terrible: their abode will be Hell,- what a bed of misery"
