  22,6,"This is so, because God is the Reality: it is He Who gives life to the dead, and it is He Who has power over all things"
  22,7,"And verily the Hour will come: there can be no doubt about it, or about (the fact) that God will raise up all who are in the graves"
  22,8,"Yet there is among men such a one as disputes about God, without Knowledge, without Guidance, and without a Book of Enlightenment"
  22,9,"(Disdainfully) bending his side, in order to lead (men) astray from the Path of God: for him there is disgrace in this life, and on the Day of Judgment We shall make him taste the Penalty of burning (Fire)"
  22,10,"(It will be said): \"This is because of the deeds which thy hands sent forth, for verily God is not unjust to His servants"
  22,11,"There are among men some who serve God, as it were, on the verge: if good befalls them, they are, therewith, well content; but if a trial comes to them, they turn on their faces: they lose both this world and the Hereafter: that is loss for all to see"
  22,12,"They call on such deities, besides God, as can neither hurt nor profit them: that is straying far indeed (from the Way)"

  22,14,"Verily God will admit those who believe and work righteous deeds, to Gardens, beneath which rivers flow: for God carries out all that He plans"
  22,15,"If any think that God will not help him (His Apostle) in this world and the Hereafter, let him stretch out a rope to the ceiling and cut (himself) off: then let him see whether his plan will remove that which enrages (him)"
