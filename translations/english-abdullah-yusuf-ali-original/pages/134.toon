quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,53,"Thus did We try some of them by comparison with others, that they should say: \"Is it these then that God hath favoured from amongst us?\" Doth not God know best those who are grateful"
  6,54,"When those come to thee who believe in Our signs, Say: \"Peace be on you: Your Lord hath inscribed for Himself (the rule of) mercy: verily, if any of you did evil in ignorance, and thereafter repented, and amend (his conduct), lo! He is Oft- for giving, Most Merciful"
  6,55,"Thus do We explain the signs in detail: that the way of the sinners may be shown up"
  6,56,"Say: \"I am forbidden to worship those - others than God - whom ye call upon.\" Say: \"I will not follow your wain desires: If I did, I would stray from the path, and be not of the company of those who receive guidance"
  6,57,"Say: \"For me, I (work) on a clear sign from my Lord, but ye reject Him. What ye would see hastened, is not in my power. The command rests with none but God: He declares the truth, and He is the best of judges"
  6,58,"Say: \"If what ye would see hastened were in my power, the matter would be settled at once between you and me. But God knoweth best those who do wrong"
  6,59,"With Him are the keys of the unseen, the treasures that none knoweth but He. He knoweth whatever there is on the earth and in the sea. Not a leaf doth fall but with His knowledge: there is not a grain in the darkness (or depths) of the earth, n or anything fresh or dry (green or withered), but is (inscribed) in a record clear (to those who can read)"
