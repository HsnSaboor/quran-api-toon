quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  47,12,"Verily God will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds, to Gardens beneath which rivers flow; while those who reject God will enjoy (this world) and eat as cattle eat; and the Fire will be their abode"
  47,13,"And how many cities, with more power than thy city which has driven thee out, have We destroyed (for their sins)? and there was none to aid them"
  47,14,"Is then one who is on a clear (Path) from his Lord, no better than one to whom the evil of his conduct seems pleasing, and such as follow their own lusts"
  47,15,"(Here is) a Parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised: in it are rivers of water incorruptible; rivers of milk of which the taste never changes; rivers of wine, a joy to those who drink; and rivers of honey pure and clear. In it th ere are for them all kinds of fruits; and Grace from their Lord. (Can those in such Bliss) be compared to such as shall dwell for ever in the Fire, and be given, to drink, boiling water, so that it cuts up their bowels (to pieces)"
  47,16,"And among them are men who listen to thee, but in the end, when they go out from thee, they say to those who have received Knowledge, \"What is it he said just then?\" Such are men whose hearts God has sealed, and who follow their own lusts"

  47,18,"Do they then only wait for the Hour,- that it should come on them of a sudden? But already have come some tokens thereof, and when it (actually) is on them, how can they benefit then by their admonition"
  47,19,"Know, therefore, that there is no god but God, and ask forgiveness for thy fault, and for the men and women who believe: for God knows how ye move about and how ye dwell in your homes"
