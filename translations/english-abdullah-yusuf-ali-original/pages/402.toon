quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  29,46,"And dispute ye not with the People of the Book, except with means better (than mere disputation), unless it be with those of them who inflict wrong (and injury): but say, \"We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that whic h came down to you; Our God and your God is one; and it is to Him we bow (in Islam)"
  29,47,"And thus (it is) that We have sent down the Book to thee. So the People of the Book believe therein, as also do some of these (pagan Arabs): and none but Unbelievers reject our signs"
  29,48,"And thou wast not (able) to recite a Book before this (Book came), nor art thou (able) to transcribe it with thy right hand: In that case, indeed, would the talkers of vanities have doubted"
  29,49,"Nay, here are Signs self-evident in the hearts of those endowed with knowledge: and none but the unjust reject Our Signs"
  29,50,"Ye they say: \"Why are not Signs sent down to him from his Lord?\" Say: \"The signs are indeed with God: and I am indeed a clear Warner"
  29,51,"And is it not enough for them that we have sent down to thee the Book which is rehearsed to them? Verily, in it is Mercy and a Reminder to those who believe"
  29,52,"Say: \"Enough is God for a witness between me and you: He knows what is in the heavens and on earth. And it is those who believe in vanities and reject God, that will perish (in the end)"
