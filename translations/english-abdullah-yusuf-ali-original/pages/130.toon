quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Say: \"What thing is most weighty in evidence?\" Say: \"God is witness between me and you; This Qur'an hath been revealed to me by inspiration, that I may warn you and all whom it reaches. Can ye possibly bear witness that besides God there is an other God?\" Say: \"Nay! I cannot bear witness!\" Say: \"But in truth He is the one God, and I truly am innocent of (your blasphemy of) joining others with Him"
  6,20,Those to whom We have given the Book know this as they know their own sons. Those who have lost their own souls refuse therefore to believe
  6,21,Who doth more wrong than he who inventeth a lie against God or rejecteth His sings? But verily the wrong-doers never shall prosper
  6,22,"One day shall We gather them all together: We shall say to those who ascribed partners (to Us): \"Where are the partners whom ye (invented and) talked about"
  6,23,"There will then be (left) no subterfuge for them but to say: \"By God our Lord, we were not those who joined gods with God"
  6,24,Behold! how they lie against their own souls! But the (lie) which they invented will leave them in the lurch
  6,25,"Of them there are some who (pretend to) listen to thee; but We have thrown veils on their hearts, So they understand it not, and deafness in their ears; if they saw every one of the signs, not they will believe in them; in so much that when th ey come to thee, they (but) dispute with thee; the Unbelievers say: \"These are nothing but tales of the ancients"
  6,26,"Others they keep away from it, and themselves they keep away; but they only destroy their own souls, and they perceive it not"
  6,27,"If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with the Fire! They will say: \"Would that we were but sent back! Then would we not reject the signs of our Lord, but would be amongst those who believe"
