quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  48,16,"Say to the desert Arabs who lagged behind: \"Ye shall be summoned (to fight) against a people given to vehement war: then shall ye fight, or they shall submit. Then if ye show obedience, God will grant you a goodly reward, but if ye turn back a s ye did before, He will punish you with a grievous Penalty"
  48,17,"No blame is there on the blind, nor is there blame on the lame, nor on one ill (if he joins not the war): But he that obeys God and his Apostle,- (God) will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and he who turns back, (God) will punis h him with a grievous Penalty"
  48,18,"God's Good Pleasure was on the Believers when they swore Fealty to thee under the Tree: He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down Tranquillity to them; and He rewarded them with a speedy Victory"
  48,19,"And many gains will they acquire (besides): and God is Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom"
  48,20,"God has promised you many gains that ye shall acquire, and He has given you these beforehand; and He has restrained the hands of men from you; that it may be a Sign for the Believers, and that He may guide you to a Straight Path"
  48,21,"And other gains (there are), which are not within your power, but which God has compassed: and God has power over all things"
  48,22,"If the Unbelievers should fight you, they would certainly turn their backs; then would they find neither protector nor helper"
  48,23,"(Such has been) the practice (approved) of God already in the past: no change wilt thou find in the practice (approved) of God"
