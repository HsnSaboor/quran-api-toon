  28,78,"He said: \"This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge which I have.\" Did he not know that God had destroyed, before him, (whole) generations,- which were superior to him in strength and greater in the amount (of riches) they had c ollected? but the wicked are not called (immediately) to account for their sins"
  28,79,"So he went forth among his people in the (pride of his wordly) glitter. Said those whose aim is the Life of this World: \"Oh! that we had the like of what Qarun has got! for he is truly a lord of mighty good fortune"
  28,80,"But those who had been granted (true) knowledge said: \"Alas for you! The reward of God (in the Hereafter) is best for those who believe and work righteousness: but this none shall attain, save those who steadfastly persevere (in good)"
  28,81,"Then We caused the earth to swallow up him and his house; and he had not (the least little) party to help him against God, nor could he defend himself"
  28,82,"And those who had envied his position the day before began to say on the morrow: \"Ah! it is indeed God Who enlarges the provision or restricts it, to any of His servants He pleases! had it not been that God was gracious to us, He could have ca used the earth to swallow us up! Ah! those who reject God will assuredly never prosper"
  28,83,"That Home of the Hereafter We shall give to those who intend not high- handedness or mischief on earth: and the end is (best) for the righteous"
  28,84,"If any does good, the reward to him is better than his deed; but if any does evil, the doers of evil are only punished (to the extent) of their deeds"
