quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,21,"Thus did We make their case known to the people, that they might know that the promise of God is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour of Judgment. Behold, they dispute among themselves as to their affair. (Some) said, \"Construct a building over them\": Their Lord knows best about them: those who prevailed over their affair said, \"Let us surely build a place of worship over them"
  18,22,"(Some) say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them; (others) say they were five, the dog being the sixth,- doubtfully guessing at the unknown; (yet others) say they were seven, the dog being the eighth. Say thou: \"My Lord knoweth best their number; It is but few that know their (real case).\" Enter not, therefore, into controversies concerning them, except on a matter that is clear, nor consult any of them about (the affair of) the Sleepers"
  18,23,"Nor say of anything, \"I shall be sure to do so and so tomorrow"
  18,24,"Without adding, \"So please God!\" and call thy Lord to mind when thou forgettest, and say, \"I hope that my Lord will guide me ever closer (even) than this to the right road"
  18,25,"So they stayed in their Cave three hundred years, and (some) add nine (more)"
  18,26,"Say: \"God knows best how long they stayed: with Him is (the knowledge of) the secrets of the heavens and the earth: how clearly He sees, how finely He hears (everything)! They have no protector other than Him; nor does He share His Command wit h any person whatsoever"
  18,27,"And recite (and teach) what has been revealed to thee of the Book of thy Lord: none can change His Words, and none wilt thou find as a refuge other than Him"
