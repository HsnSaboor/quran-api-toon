quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  8,17,"It is not ye who slew them; it was God: when thou threwest (a handful of dust), it was not thy act, but God's: in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself: for God is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things)"
  8,18,"That, and also because God is He Who makes feeble the plans and stratagem of the Unbelievers"
  8,19,"(O Unbelievers!) if ye prayed for victory and judgment, now hath the judgment come to you: if ye desist (from wrong), it will be best for you: if ye return (to the attack), so shall We. Not the least good will your forces be to you even if they were multiplied: for verily God is with those who believe"
  8,20,"O ye who believe! Obey God and His Apostle, and turn not away from him when ye hear (him speak)"
  8,21,"Nor be like those who say, \"We hear,\" but listen not"
  8,22,"For the worst of beasts in the sight of God are the deaf and the dumb,- those who understand not"
  8,23,"If God had found in them any good. He would indeed have made them listen: (As it is), if He had made them listen, they would but have turned back and declined (Faith)"
  8,24,"O ye who believe! give your response to God and His Apostle, when He calleth you to that which will give you life; and know that God cometh in between a man and his heart, and that it is He to Whom ye shall (all) be gathered"
  8,25,"And fear tumult or oppression, which affecteth not in particular (only) those of you who do wrong: and know that God is strict in punishment"
