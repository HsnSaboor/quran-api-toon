quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the Sky and the Night-Visitant (therein)
  86,2,And what will explain to thee what the Night-Visitant is
  86,3,(It is) the Star of piercing brightness
  86,4,There is no soul but has a protector over it
  86,5,Now let man but think from what he is created
  86,6,He is created from a drop emitted
  86,7,Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs
  86,8,Surely (God) is able to bring him back (to life)
  86,9,The Day that (all) things secret will be tested
  86,10,"(Man) will have no power, and no helper"
  86,11,By the Firmament which returns (in its round)
  86,12,And by the Earth which opens out (for the gushing of springs or the sprouting of vegetation)
  86,13,Behold this is the Word that distinguishes (Good from Evil)
  86,14,It is not a thing for amusement
  86,15,"As for them, they are but plotting a scheme"
  86,16,And I am planning a scheme
  86,17,"Therefore grant a delay to the Unbelievers: Give respite to them gently (for awhile)"
  87,1,Glorify the name of thy Guardian-Lord Most High
  87,2,"Who hath created, and further, given order and proportion"
  87,3,Who hath ordained laws. And granted guidance
  87,4,And Who bringeth out the (green and luscious) pasture
  87,5,And then doth make it (but) swarthy stubble
  87,6,"By degrees shall We teach thee to declare (the Message), so thou shalt not forget"
  87,7,"Except as God wills: For He knoweth what is manifest and what is hidden"
  87,8,And We will make it easy for thee (to follow) the simple (Path)
  87,9,Therefore give admonition in case the admonition profits (the hearer)
  87,10,The admonition will be received by those who fear (God)
  87,11,But it will be avoided by those most unfortunate ones
  87,12,Who will enter the Great Fire
  87,13,In which they will then neither die nor live
  87,14,But those will prosper who purify themselves
  87,15,"And glorify the name of their Guardian-Lord, and (lift their hearts) in prayer"
