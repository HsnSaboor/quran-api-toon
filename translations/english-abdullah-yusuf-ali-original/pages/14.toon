quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,89,"And when there comes to them a Book from God, confirming what is with them,- although from of old they had prayed for victory against those without Faith,- when there comes to them that which they (should) have recognised, they refuse to belie ve in it but the curse of God is on those without Faith"
  2,90,"Miserable is the price for which they have sold their souls, in that they deny (the revelation) which God has sent down, in insolent envy that God of His Grace should send it to any of His servants He pleases: Thus have they drawn on themselves Wrath upon Wrath. And humiliating is the punishment of those who reject Faith"
  2,91,"When it is said to them, \"Believe in what God Hath sent down, \"they say, \"We believe in what was sent down to us:\" yet they reject all besides, even if it be Truth confirming what is with them. Say: \"Why then have ye slain the prophets of God in times gone by, if ye did indeed believe"
  2,92,"There came to you Moses with clear (Signs); yet ye worshipped the calf (Even) after that, and ye did behave wrongfully"
  2,93,"And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai): (Saying): \"Hold firmly to what We have given you, and hearken (to the Law)\": They said:\" We hear, and we disobey:\" And they had to drink into th eir hearts (of the taint) of the calf because of their Faithlessness. Say: \"Vile indeed are the behests of your Faith if ye have any faith"
