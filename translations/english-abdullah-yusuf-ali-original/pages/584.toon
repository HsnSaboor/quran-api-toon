  79,16,"Behold, thy Lord did call to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa"
  79,17,Go thou to Pharaoh for he has indeed transgressed all bounds
  79,18,"And say to him, 'Wouldst thou that thou shouldst be purified (from sin)"
  79,19,"And that I guide thee to thy Lord, so thou shouldst fear Him"
  79,20,Then did (Moses) show him the Great Sign
  79,21,But (Pharaoh) rejected it and disobeyed (guidance)
  79,22,"Further, he turned his back, striving hard (against God)"
  79,23,Then he collected (his men) and made a proclamation
  79,24,"Saying, \"I am your Lord, Most High"
  79,25,"But God did punish him, (and made an) example of him, - in the Hereafter, as in this life"
  79,26,Verily in this is an instructive warning for whosoever feareth (God)
  79,27,What! Are ye the more difficult to create or the heaven (above)? (God) hath constructed it
  79,28,"On high hath He raised its canopy, and He hath given it order and perfection"
  79,29,"Its night doth He endow with darkness, and its splendour doth He bring out (with light)"
  79,30,"And the earth, moreover, hath He extended (to a wide expanse)"
  79,31,He draweth out therefrom its moisture and its pasture
  79,32,And the mountains hath He firmly fixed
  79,33,For use and convenience to you and your cattle

  79,35,The Day when man shall remember (all) that he strove for
  79,36,And Hell-Fire shall be placed in full view for (all) to see
  79,37,"Then, for such as had transgressed all bounds"
  79,38,And had preferred the life of this world
  79,39,The Abode will be Hell-Fire
  79,40,And for such as had entertained the fear of standing before their Lord's (tribunal) and had restrained (their) soul from lower desires
  79,41,Their abode will be the Garden
  79,42,"They ask thee about the Hour,-'When will be its appointed time"
  79,43,Wherein art thou (concerned) with the declaration thereof
  79,44,With thy Lord in the Limit fixed therefor
  79,45,Thou art but a Warner for such as fear it
  79,46,"The Day they see it, (It will be) as if they had tarried but a single evening, or (at most till) the following morn"
