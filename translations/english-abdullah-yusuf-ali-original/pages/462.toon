quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  39,32,"Who, then, doth more wrong than one who utters a lie concerning God, and rejects the Truth when it comes to him; is there not in Hell an abode for blasphemers"
  39,33,And he who brings the Truth and he who confirms (and supports) it - such are the men who do right
  39,34,"They shall have all that they wish for, in the presence of their Lord: such is the reward of those who do good"
  39,35,So that God will turn off from them (even) the worst in their deeds and give them their reward according to the best of what they have done
  39,36,"Is not God enough for his Servant? But they try to frighten thee with other (gods) besides Him! for such as God leaves to stray, there can be no guide"
  39,37,"And such as God doth guide there can be none to lead astray. Is not God Exalted in Power, (Able to enforce His Will), Lord of Retribution"
  39,38,"If indeed thou ask them who it is that created the heavens and the earth, they would be sure to say, \"God\". Say: \"See ye then? the things that ye invoke besides God,- can they, if God wills some Penalty for me, remove His Penalty?- Or if He wi lls some Grace for me, can they keep back his Grace?\" Say: \"Sufficient is God for me! In Him trust those who put their trust"
  39,39,"Say: \"O my People! Do whatever ye can: I will do (my part): but soon will ye know"
  39,40,"Who it is to whom comes a Penalty of ignominy, and on whom descends a Penalty that abides"
