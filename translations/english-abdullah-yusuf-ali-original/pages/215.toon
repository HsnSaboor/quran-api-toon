quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,54,"Every soul that hath sinned, if it possessed all that is on earth, would fain give it in ransom: They would declare (their) repentance when they see the penalty: but the judgment between them will be with justice, and no wrong will be done unt o them"
  10,55,Is it not (the case) that to God belongeth whatever is in the heavens and on earth? Is it not (the case) that God's promise is assuredly true? Yet most of them understand not
  10,56,"It is He Who giveth life and who taketh it, and to Him shall ye all be brought back"
  10,57,"O mankind! there hath come to you a direction from your Lord and a healing for the (diseases) in your hearts,- and for those who believe, a guidance and a Mercy"
  10,58,"Say: \"In the bounty of God. And in His Mercy,- in that let them rejoice\": that is better than the (wealth) they hoard"
  10,59,"Say: \"See ye what things God hath sent down to you for sustenance? Yet ye hold forbidden some things thereof and (some things) lawful.\" Say: \"Hath God indeed permitted you, or do ye invent (things) to attribute to God"
  10,60,"And what think those who invent lies against God, of the Day of Judgment? Verily God is full of bounty to mankind, but most of them are ungrateful"
  10,61,"In whatever business thou mayest be, and whatever portion thou mayest be reciting from the Qur'an,- and whatever deed ye (mankind) may be doing,- We are witnesses thereof when ye are deeply engrossed therein. Nor is hidden from thy Lord (so mu ch as) the weight of an atom on the earth or in heaven. And not the least and not the greatest of these things but are recorded in a clear record"
