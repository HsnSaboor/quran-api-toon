quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  33,44,"Their salutation on the Day they meet Him will be \"Peace!\"; and He has prepared for them a generous Reward"
  33,45,"O Prophet! Truly We have sent thee as a Witness, a Bearer of Glad Tidings, and Warner"
  33,46,"And as one who invites to God's (grace) by His leave, and as a lamp spreading light"
  33,47,"Then give the Glad Tidings to the Believers, that they shall have from God a very great Bounty"
  33,48,"And obey not (the behests) of the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and heed not their annoyances, but put thy Trust in God. For enough is God as a Disposer of affairs"
  33,49,"O ye who believe! When ye marry believing women, and then divorce them before ye have touched them, no period of 'Iddat have ye to count in respect of them: so give them a present. And set them free in a handsome manner"
  33,50,"O Prophet! We have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou hast paid their dowers; and those whom thy right hand possesses out of the prisoners of war whom God has assigned to thee; and daughters of thy paternal uncles and aunts, and daught ers of thy maternal uncles and aunts, who migrated (from Makka) with thee; and any believing woman who dedicates her soul to the Prophet if the Prophet wishes to wed her;- this only for thee, and not for the Believers (at large); We know what We have appointed for them as to their wives and the captives whom their right hands possess;- in order that there should be no difficulty for thee. And God is Oft- Forgiving, Most Merciful"
