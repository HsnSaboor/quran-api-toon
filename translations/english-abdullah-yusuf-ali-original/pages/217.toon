quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,71,"Relate to them the story of Noah. Behold! he said to his people: \"O my people, if it be hard on your (mind) that I should stay (with you) and commemorate the signs of God,- yet I put my trust in God. Get ye then an agreement about your plan a nd among your partners, so your plan be on to you dark and dubious. Then pass your sentence on me, and give me no respite"
  10,72,"But if ye turn back, (consider): no reward have I asked of you: my reward is only due from God, and I have been commanded to be of those who submit to God's will (in Islam)"
  10,73,"They rejected Him, but We delivered him, and those with him, in the Ark, and We made them inherit (the earth), while We overwhelmed in the flood those who rejected Our Signs. Then see what was the end of those who were warned (but heeded not)"
  10,74,"Then after him We sent (many) apostles to their peoples: they brought them Clear Signs, but they would not believe what they had already rejected beforehand. Thus do We seal the hearts of the transgressors"
  10,75,"Then after them sent We Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our Signs. But they were arrogant: they were a people in sin"
  10,76,"When the Truth did come to them from Us, they said: \"This is indeed evident sorcery"
  10,77,"Said Moses: \"Say ye (this) about the truth when it hath (actually) reached you? Is sorcery (like) this? But sorcerers will not prosper"
  10,78,"They said: \"Hast thou come to us to turn us away from the ways we found our fathers following,- in order that thou and thy brother may have greatness in the land? But not we shall believe in you"
