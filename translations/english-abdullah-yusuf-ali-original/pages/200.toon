quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,80,"Whether thou ask for their forgiveness, or not, (their sin is unforgivable): if thou ask seventy times for their forgiveness, God will not forgive them: because they have rejected God and His Apostle: and God guideth not those who are perverse ly rebellious"
  9,81,"Those who were left behind (in the Tabuk expedition) rejoiced in their inaction behind the back of the Apostle of God: they hated to strive and fight, with their goods and their persons, in the cause of God: they said, \"Go not forth in the hea t.\" Say, \"The fire of Hell is fiercer in heat.\" If only they could understand"
  9,82,"Let them laugh a little: much will they weep: a recompense for the (evil) that they do"
  9,83,"If, then, God bring thee back to any of them, and they ask thy permission to come out (with thee), say: \"Never shall ye come out with me, nor fight an enemy with me: for ye preferred to sit inactive on the first occasion: Then sit ye (now) wit h those who lag behind"

  9,85,"Nor let their wealth nor their (following in) sons dazzle thee: God's plan is to punish them with these things in this world, and that their souls may perish in their (very) denial of God"
  9,86,"When a Sura comes down, enjoining them to believe in God and to strive and fight along with His Apostle, those with wealth and influence among them ask thee for exemption, and say: \"Leave us (behind): we would be with those who sit (at home)"
