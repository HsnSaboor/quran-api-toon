quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the Sun and his (glorious) splendour
  91,2,By the Moon as she follows him
  91,3,By the Day as it shows up (the Sun's) glory
  91,4,By the Night as it conceals it
  91,5,By the Firmament and its (wonderful) structure
  91,6,By the Earth and its (wide) expanse
  91,7,"By the Soul, and the proportion and order given to it"
  91,8,And its enlightenment as to its wrong and its right
  91,9,Truly he succeeds that purifies it
  91,10,And he fails that corrupts it
  91,11,The Thamud (people) rejected (their prophet) through their inordinate wrong-doing
  91,12,"Behold, the most wicked man among them was deputed (for impiety)"
  91,13,"But the Apostle of God said to them: \"It is a She-camel of God! And (bar her not from) having her drink"
  91,14,"Then they rejected him (as a false prophet), and they hamstrung her. So their Lord, on account of their crime, obliterated their traces and made them equal (in destruction, high and low)"
  91,15,And for Him is no fear of its consequences
  92,1,By the Night as it conceals (the light)
  92,2,By the Day as it appears in glory
  92,3,By (the mystery of) the creation of male and female
  92,4,"Verily, (the ends) ye strive for are diverse"
  92,5,So he who gives (in charity) and fears (God)
  92,6,And (in all sincerity) testifies to the best
  92,7,We will indeed make smooth for him the path to Bliss
  92,8,But he who is a greedy miser and thinks himself self-sufficient
  92,9,And gives the lie to the best
  92,10,We will indeed make smooth for him the path to Misery
  92,11,Nor will his wealth profit him when he falls headlong (into the Pit)
  92,12,Verily We take upon Ourselves to guide
  92,13,And verily unto Us (belong) the End and the Beginning
  92,14,Therefore do I warn you of a Fire blazing fiercely
