quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  7,160,"We divided them into twelve tribes or nations. We directed Moses by inspiration, when his (thirsty) people asked him for water: \"Strike the rock with thy staff\": out of it there gushed forth twelve springs: Each group knew its own place for w ater. We gave them the shade of clouds, and sent down to them manna and quails, (saying): \"Eat of the good things We have provided for you\": (but they rebelled); to Us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls"
  7,161,"And remember it was said to them: \"Dwell in this town and eat therein as ye wish, but say the word of humility and enter the gate in a posture of humility: We shall forgive you your faults; We shall increase (the portion of) those who do good"
  7,162,But the transgressors among them changed the word from that which had been given them so we sent on them a plague from heaven. For that they repeatedly transgressed
  7,163,"Ask them concerning the town standing close by the sea. Behold! they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath. For on the day of their Sabbath their fish did come to them, openly holding up their heads, but on the day they had no Sabbath, th ey came not: thus did We make a trial of them, for they were given to transgression"
