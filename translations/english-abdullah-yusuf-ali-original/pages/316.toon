  20,65,"They said: \"O Moses! whether wilt thou that thou throw (first) or that we be the first to throw"
  20,66,"He said, \"Nay, throw ye first!\" Then behold their ropes and their rods-so it seemed to him on account of their magic - began to be in lively motion"
  20,67,So Moses conceived in his mind a (sort of) fear
  20,68,"We said: \"Fear not! for thou hast indeed the upper hand"
  20,69,"Throw that which is in thy right hand: Quickly will it swallow up that which they have faked what they have faked is but a magician's trick: and the magician thrives not, (no matter) where he goes"
  20,70,"So the magicians were thrown down to prostration: they said, \"We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses"
  20,71,"(Pharaoh) said: \"Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? Surely this must be your leader, who has taught you magic! be sure I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will have you crucified on trunks of palm-trees: so shall ye know for certain, which of us can give the more severe and the more lasting punishment"
  20,72,"They said: \"Never shall we regard thee as more than the Clear Sings that have come to us, or than Him Who created us! so decree whatever thou desirest to decree: for thou canst only decree (touching) the life of this world"
  20,73,"For us, we have believed in our Lord: may He forgive us our faults, and the magic to which thou didst compel us: for God is Best and Most Abiding"
  20,74,"Verily he who comes to his Lord as a sinner (at Judgment),- for him is Hell: therein shall he neither die nor live"
  20,75,"But such as come to Him as Believers who have worked righteous deeds,- for them are ranks exalted"
  20,76,"Gardens of Eternity, beneath which flow rivers: they will dwell therein for aye: such is the reward of those who purify themselves (from evil)"
