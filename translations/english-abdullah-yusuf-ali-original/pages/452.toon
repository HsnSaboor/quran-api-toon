quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you? How judge ye
  37,155,Will ye not then receive admonition
  37,156,Or have ye an authority manifest
  37,157,Then bring ye your Book (of authority) if ye be truthful
  37,158,"And they have invented a blood-relationship between Him and the Jinns: but the Jinns know (quite well) that they have indeed to appear (before his Judgment- Seat)"
  37,159,Glory to God! (He is free) from the things they ascribe (to Him)
  37,160,"Not (so do) the Servants of God, sincere and devoted"
  37,161,"For, verily, neither ye nor those ye worship"
  37,162,Can lead (any) into temptation concerning God
  37,163,Except such as are (themselves) going to the blazing Fire
  37,164,"(Those ranged in ranks say): \"Not one of us but has a place appointed"
  37,165,And we are verily ranged in ranks (for service)
  37,166,And we are verily those who declare (God's) glory
  37,167,And there were those who said
  37,168,If only we had had before us a Message from those of old
  37,169,"We should certainly have been Servants of God, sincere (and devoted)"
  37,170,"But (now that the Qur'an has come), they reject it: But soon will they know"
  37,171,Already has Our Word been passed before (this) to our Servants sent (by Us)
  37,172,That they would certainly be assisted
  37,173,"And that Our forces,- they surely must conquer"
  37,174,So turn thou away from them for a little while
  37,175,"And watch them (how they fare), and they soon shall see (how thou farest)"
  37,176,Do they wish (indeed) to hurry on our Punishment
  37,177,"But when it descends into the open space before them, evil will be the morning for those who were warned (and heeded not)"
  37,178,So turn thou away from them for a little while
  37,179,And watch (how they fare) and they soon shall see (how thou farest)
  37,180,"Glory to thy Lord, the Lord of Honour and Power! (He is free) from what they ascribe (to Him)"
  37,181,And Peace on the apostles
  37,182,"And Praise to God, the Lord and Cherisher of the Worlds"
