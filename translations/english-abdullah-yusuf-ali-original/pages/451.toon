  37,127,"But they rejected him, and they will certainly be called up (for punishment)"
  37,128,Except the sincere and devoted Servants of God (among them)
  37,129,And We left (this blessing) for him among generations (to come) in later times
  37,130,Peace and salutation to such as Elias
  37,131,Thus indeed do We reward those who do right
  37,132,For he was one of our believing Servants
  37,133,So also was Lut among those sent (by Us)
  37,134,"Behold, We delivered him and his adherents, all"
  37,135,Except an old woman who was among those who lagged behind
  37,136,Then We destroyed the rest
  37,137,"Verily, ye pass by their (sites), by day"
  37,138,"And by night: will ye not understand"
  37,139,So also was Jonah among those sent (by Us)
  37,140,When he ran away (like a slave from captivity) to the ship (fully) laden
  37,141,"He (agreed to) cast lots, and he was condemned"
  37,142,"Then the big Fish did swallow him, and he had done acts worthy of blame"
  37,143,Had it not been that he (repented and) glorified God
  37,144,He would certainly have remained inside the Fish till the Day of Resurrection
  37,145,But We cast him forth on the naked shore in a state of sickness
  37,146,"And We caused to grow, over him, a spreading plant of the gourd kind"
  37,147,And We sent him (on a mission) to a hundred thousand (men) or more
  37,148,And they believed; so We permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while
  37,149,"Now ask them their opinion: Is it that thy Lord has (only) daughters, and they have sons"
  37,150,"Or that We created the angels female, and they are witnesses (thereto)"
  37,151,"Is it not that they say, from their own invention"
  37,152,"God has begotten children\"? but they are liars"
  37,153,Did He (then) choose daughters rather than sons
