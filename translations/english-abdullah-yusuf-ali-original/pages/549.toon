quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  60,1,"O ye who believe! Take not my enemies and yours as friends (or protectors),- offering them (your) love, even though they have rejected the Truth that has come to you, and have (on the contrary) driven out the Prophet and yourselves (from your homes), (simply) because ye believe in God your Lord! If ye have come out to strive in My Way and to seek My Good Pleasure, (take them not as friends), holding secret converse of love (and friendship) with them: for I know full well all that ye conceal and all that ye reveal. And any of you that does this has strayed from the Straight Path"
  60,2,"If they were to get the better of you, they would behave to you as enemies, and stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you for evil: and they desire that ye should reject the Truth"
  60,3,"Of no profit to you will be your relatives and your children on the Day of Judgment: He will judge between you: for God sees well all that ye do"
  60,4,"There is for you an excellent example (to follow) in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people: \"We are clear of you and of whatever ye worship besides God: we have rejected you, and there has arisen, between us and you, enmity and hatred for ever,- unless ye believe in God and Him alone\": But not when Abraham said to his father: \"I will pray for forgiveness for thee, though I have no power (to get) aught on thy behalf from God.\" (They prayed): \"Our Lord! in Thee do we trus t, and to Thee do we turn in repentance: to Thee is (our) Final Goal"
  60,5,"Our Lord! Make us not a (test and) trial for the Unbelievers, but forgive us, our Lord! for Thou art the Exalted in Might, the Wise"
