  26,207,It will profit them not that they enjoyed (this life)
  26,208,"Never did We destroy a population, but had its warners"
  26,209,By way of reminder; and We never are unjust
  26,210,No evil ones have brought down this (Revelation)
  26,211,It would neither suit them nor would they be able (to produce it)
  26,212,Indeed they have been removed far from even (a chance of) hearing it
  26,213,"So call not on any other god with God, or thou wilt be among those under the Penalty"
  26,214,And admonish thy nearest kinsmen
  26,215,And lower thy wing to the Believers who follow thee
  26,216,"Then if they disobey thee, say: \"I am free (of responsibility) for what ye do"

  26,226,And that they say what they practise not
