quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,15,"But when Our Clear Signs are rehearsed unto them, those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, Say: \"Bring us a reading other than this, or change this,\" Say: \"It is not for me, of my own accord, to change it: I follow naught but wha t is revealed unto me: if I were to disobey my Lord, I should myself fear the penalty of a Great Day (to come)"
  10,16,"Say: \"If God had so willed, I should not have rehearsed it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. A whole life-time before this have I tarried amongst you: will ye not then understand"
  10,17,"Who doth more wrong than such as forge a lie against God, or deny His Signs? But never will prosper those who sin"
  10,18,"They serve, besides God, things that hurt them not nor profit them, and they say: \"These are our intercessors with God.\" Say: \"Do ye indeed inform God of something He knows not, in the heavens or on earth?- Glory to Him! and far is He above th e partners they ascribe (to Him)"
  10,19,"Mankind was but one nation, but differed (later). Had it not been for a word that went forth before from thy Lord, their differences would have been settled between them"
  10,20,"They say: \"Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?\" Say: \"The Unseen is only for God (to know), then wait ye: I too will wait with you"
