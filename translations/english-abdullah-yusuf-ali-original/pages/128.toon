quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,1,"Praise be God, Who created the heavens and the earth, and made the darkness and the light. Yet those who reject Faith hold (others) as equal, with their Guardian-Lord"
  6,2,"He it is created you from clay, and then decreed a stated term (for you). And there is in His presence another determined term; yet ye doubt within yourselves"
  6,3,"And He is God in the heavens and on earth. He knoweth what ye hide, and what ye reveal, and He knoweth the (recompense) which ye earn (by your deeds)"
  6,4,"But never did a single one of the signs of their Lord reach them, but they turned away therefrom"
  6,5,"And now they reject the truth when it reaches them: but soon shall they learn the reality of what they used to mock at"
  6,6,"See they not how many of those before them We did destroy?- generations We had established on the earth, in strength such as We have not given to you - for whom We poured out rain from the skies in abundance, and gave (fertile) streams flowing beneath their (feet): yet for their sins We destroyed them, and raised in their wake fresh generations (to succeed them)"
  6,7,"If We had sent unto thee a written (message) on parchment, so that they could touch it with their hands, the Unbelievers would have been sure to say: \"This is nothing but obvious magic"
  6,8,"They say: \"Why is not an angel sent down to him?\" If we did send down an angel, the matter would be settled at once, and no respite would be granted them"
