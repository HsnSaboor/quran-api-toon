quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,None shall reach it but those most unfortunate ones
  92,16,Who give the lie to Truth and turn their backs
  92,17,But those most devoted to God shall be removed far from it
  92,18,Those who spend their wealth for increase in self-purification
  92,19,And have in their minds no favour from anyone for which a reward is expected in return
  92,20,But only the desire to seek for the Countenance of their Lord Most High
  92,21,And soon will they attain (complete) satisfaction
  93,1,By the Glorious Morning Light
  93,2,And by the Night when it is still
  93,3,"Thy Guardian-Lord hath not forsaken thee, nor is He displeased"
  93,4,And verily the Hereafter will be better for thee than the present
  93,5,And soon will thy Guardian-Lord give thee (that wherewith) thou shalt be well-pleased
  93,6,Did He not find thee an orphan and give thee shelter (and care)
  93,7,"And He found thee wandering, and He gave thee guidance"
  93,8,"And He found thee in need, and made thee independent"
  93,9,"Therefore, treat not the orphan with harshness"
  93,10,Nor repulse the petitioner (unheard)
  93,11,But the bounty of the Lord - rehearse and proclaim
  94,1,Have We not expanded thee thy breast
  94,2,And removed from thee thy burden
  94,3,The which did gall thy back
  94,4,And raised high the esteem (in which) thou (art held)
  94,5,"So, verily, with every difficulty, there is relief"
  94,6,"Verily, with every difficulty there is relief"
  94,7,"Therefore, when thou art free (from thine immediate task), still labour hard"
  94,8,And to thy Lord turn (all) thy attention
