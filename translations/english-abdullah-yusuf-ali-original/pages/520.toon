quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,"But how many generations before them did We destroy (for their sins),- stronger in power than they? Then did they wander through the land: was there any place of escape (for them)"
  50,37,Verily in this is a Message for any that has a heart and understanding or who gives ear and earnestly witnesses (the truth)
  50,38,"We created the heavens and the earth and all between them in Six Days, nor did any sense of weariness touch Us"
  50,39,"Bear, then, with patience, all that they say, and celebrate the praises of thy Lord, before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting"
  50,40,"And during part of the night, (also,) celebrate His praises, and (so likewise) after the postures of adoration"
  50,41,And listen for the Day when the Caller will call out from a place quiet near
  50,42,"The Day when they will hear a (mighty) Blast in (very) truth: that will be the Day of Resurrection"
  50,43,Verily it is We Who give Life and Death; and to Us is the Final Goal
  50,44,"The Day when the Earth will be rent asunder, from (men) hurrying out: that will be a gathering together,- quite easy for Us"
  50,45,We know best what they say; and thou art not one to overawe them by force. So admonish with the Qur'an such as fear My Warning
  51,1,By the (Winds) that scatter broadcast
  51,2,And those that lift and bear away heavy weights
  51,3,And those that flow with ease and gentleness
  51,4,And those that distribute and apportion by Command
  51,5,Verily that which ye are promised is true
  51,6,And verily Judgment and Justice must indeed come to pass
