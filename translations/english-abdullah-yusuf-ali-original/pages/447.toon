  37,26,"Nay, but that day they shall submit (to Judgment)"
  37,27,"And they will turn to one another, and question one another"
  37,28,"They will say: \"It was ye who used to come to us from the right hand (of power and authority)"
  37,29,"They will reply: \"Nay, ye yourselves had no Faith"
  37,30,"Nor had we any authority over you. Nay, it was ye who were a people in obstinate rebellion"
  37,31,"So now has been proved true, against us, the word of our Lord that we shall indeed (have to) taste (the punishment of our sins)"
  37,32,"We led you astray: for truly we were ourselves astray"
  37,33,"Truly, that Day, they will (all) share in the Penalty"
  37,34,Verily that is how We shall deal with Sinners
  37,35,"For they, when they were told that there is no god except God, would puff themselves up with Pride"

  37,38,Ye shall indeed taste of the Grievous Penalty
  37,39,But it will be no more than the retribution of (the Evil) that ye have wrought

  37,41,For them is a Sustenance determined
  37,42,Fruits (Delights); and they (shall enjoy) honour and dignity
  37,43,In Gardens of Felicity
  37,44,Facing each other on Thrones (of Dignity)

  37,46,"Crystal-white, of a taste delicious to those who drink (thereof)"
  37,47,Free from headiness; nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom
  37,48,"And besides them will be chaste women, restraining their glances, with big eyes (of wonder and beauty)"
  37,49,As if they were (delicate) eggs closely guarded
  37,50,Then they will turn to one another and question one another
  37,51,"One of them will start the talk and say: \"I had an intimate companion (on the earth)"
