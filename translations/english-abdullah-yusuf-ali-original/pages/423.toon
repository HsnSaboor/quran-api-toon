quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,"It is not fitting for a Believer, man or woman, when a matter has been decided by God and His Apostle to have any option about their decision: if any one disobeys God and His Apostle, he is indeed on a clearly wrong Path"
  33,37,"Behold! Thou didst say to one who had received the grace of God and thy favour: \"Retain thou (in wedlock) thy wife, and fear God.\" But thou didst hide in thy heart that which God was about to make manifest: thou didst fear the people, but it is more fitting that thou shouldst fear God. Then when Zaid had dissolved (his marriage) with her, with the necessary (formality), We joined her in marriage to thee: in order that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the Believers in (the matter of) marriage with the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have dissolved with the necessary (formality) (their marriage) with them. And God's command must be fulfilled"
  33,38,There can be no difficulty to the Prophet in what God has indicated to him as a duty. It was the practice (approved) of God amongst those of old that have passed away. And the command of God is a decree determined
  33,39,"(It is the practice of those) who preach the Messages of God, and fear Him, and fear none but God. And enough is God to call (men) to account"
  33,40,"Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but (he is) the Apostle of God, and the Seal of the Prophets: and God has full knowledge of all things"
  33,41,"O ye who believe! Celebrate the praises of God, and do this often"
  33,42,And glorify Him morning and evening
  33,43,"He it is Who sends blessings on you, as do His angels, that He may bring you out from the depths of Darkness into Light: and He is Full of Mercy to the Believers"
