quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,1,"They ask thee concerning (things taken as) spoils of war. Say: \"(such) spoils are at the disposal of God and the Apostle: So fear God, and keep straight the relations between yourselves: Obey God and His Apostle, if ye do believe"
  8,2,"For, Believers are those who, when God is mentioned, feel a tremor in their hearts, and when they hear His signs rehearsed, find their faith strengthened, and put (all) their trust in their Lord"
  8,3,Who establish regular prayers and spend (freely) out of the gifts We have given them for sustenance
  8,4,"Such in truth are the believers: they have grades of dignity with their Lord, and forgiveness, and generous sustenance"
  8,5,"Just as thy Lord ordered thee out of thy house in truth, even though a party among the Believers disliked it"
  8,6,"Disputing with thee concerning the truth after it was made manifest, as if they were being driven to death and they (actually) saw it"
  8,7,"Behold! God promised you one of the two (enemy) parties, that it should be yours: Ye wished that the one unarmed should be yours, but God willed to justify the Truth according to His words and to cut off the roots of the Unbelievers"
  8,8,"That He might justify Truth and prove Falsehood false, distasteful though it be to those in guilt"
