quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,For the covenants (of security and safeguard enjoyed) by the Quraish
  106,2,Their covenants (covering) journeys by winter and summer
  106,3,Let them adore the Lord of this House
  106,4,"Who provides them with food against hunger, and with security against fear (of danger)"
  107,1,Seest thou one who denies the Judgment (to come)
  107,2,Then such is the (man) who repulses the orphan (with harshness)
  107,3,And encourages not the feeding of the indigent
  107,4,So woe to the worshippers
  107,5,Who are neglectful of their prayers
  107,6,Those who (want but) to be seen (of men)
  107,7,But refuse (to supply) (even) neighbourly needs
  108,1,To thee have We granted the Fount (of Abundance)
  108,2,Therefore to thy Lord turn in Prayer and Sacrifice
  108,3,"For he who hateth thee, he will be cut off (from Future Hope)"
