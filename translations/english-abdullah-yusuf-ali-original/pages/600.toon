quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,And that which is (locked up) in (human) breasts is made manifest
  100,11,"That their Lord had been Well-acquainted with them, (even to) that Day"
  101,1,The (Day) of Noise and Clamour
  101,2,What is the (Day) of Noise and Clamour
  101,3,And what will explain to thee what the (Day) of Noise and Clamour is
  101,4,(It is) a Day whereon men will be like moths scattered about
  101,5,And the mountains will be like carded wool
  101,6,"Then, he whose balance (of good deeds) will be (found) heavy"
  101,7,Will be in a life of good pleasure and satisfaction
  101,8,But he whose balance (of good deeds) will be (found) light
  101,9,Will have his home in a (bottomless) Pit
  101,10,And what will explain to thee what this is
  101,11,(It is) a Fire Blazing fiercely
  102,1,The mutual rivalry for piling up (the good things of this world) diverts you (from the more serious things)
  102,2,Until ye visit the graves
  102,3,"But nay, ye soon shall know (the reality)"
  102,4,"Again, ye soon shall know"
  102,5,"Nay, were ye to know with certainty of mind, (ye would beware)"
  102,6,Ye shall certainly see Hell-Fire
  102,7,"Again, ye shall see it with certainty of sight"
  102,8,"Then, shall ye be questioned that Day about the joy (ye indulged in)"
