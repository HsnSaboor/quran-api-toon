quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,135,"They say: \"Become Jews or Christians if ye would be guided (To salvation).\" Say thou: \"Nay! (I would rather) the Religion of Abraham the True, and he joined not gods with God"
  2,136,"Say ye: \"We believe in God, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to (all) prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between one and another of them: And we bow to God (in Islam)"
  2,137,"So if they believe as ye believe, they are indeed on the right path; but if they turn back, it is they who are in schism; but God will suffice thee as against them, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing"
  2,138,"(Our religion is) the Baptism of God: And who can baptize better than God? And it is He Whom we worship"
  2,139,"Say: Will ye dispute with us about God, seeing that He is our Lord and your Lord; that we are responsible for our doings and ye for yours; and that We are sincere (in our faith) in Him"
  2,140,"Or do ye say that Abraham, Isma'il Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: Do ye know better than God? Ah! who is more unjust than those who conceal the testimony they have from God? but God is not unmindful of what ye do"
  2,141,"That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of what they did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no question in your case"
