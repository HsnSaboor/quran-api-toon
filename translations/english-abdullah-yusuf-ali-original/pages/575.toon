quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Thy Lord doth know that thou standest forth (to prayer) nigh two-thirds of the night, or half the night, or a third of the night, and so doth a party of those with thee. But God doth appoint night and day in due measure He knoweth that ye are unable to keep count thereof. So He hath turned to you (in mercy): read ye, therefore, of the Qur'an as much as may be easy for you. He knoweth that there may be (some) among you in ill-health; others travelling through the land, seeking of God's bounty ; yet others fighting in God's Cause, read ye, therefore, as much of the Qur'an as may be easy (for you); and establish regular Prayer and give regular Charity; and loan to God a Beautiful Loan. And whatever good ye send forth for your souls ye shall f ind it in God's Presence,- yea, better and greater, in Reward and seek ye the Grace of God: for God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  74,1,O thou wrapped up (in the mantle)
  74,2,Arise and deliver thy warning
  74,3,And thy Lord do thou magnify
  74,4,And thy garments keep free from stain
  74,5,And all abomination shun
  74,6,"Nor expect, in giving, any increase (for thyself)"
  74,7,"But, for thy Lord's (Cause), be patient and constant"
  74,8,"Finally, when the Trumpet is sounded"
  74,9,That will be- that Day - a Day of Distress
  74,10,Far from easy for those without Faith
  74,11,"Leave Me alone, (to deal) with the (creature) whom I created (bare and) alone"
  74,12,To whom I granted resources in abundance
  74,13,And sons to be by his side
  74,14,To whom I made (life) smooth and comfortable
  74,15,Yet is he greedy-that I should add (yet more)
  74,16,By no means! For to Our Signs he has been refractory
  74,17,Soon will I visit him with a mount of calamities
