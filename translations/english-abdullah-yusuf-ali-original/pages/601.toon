  103,1,By (the Token of) Time (through the ages)
  103,2,Verily Man is in loss
  103,3,"Except such as have Faith, and do righteous deeds, and (join together) in the mutual teaching of Truth, and of Patience and Constancy"
  104,1,Woe to every (kind of) scandal-monger and-backbiter
  104,2,Who pileth up wealth and layeth it by
  104,3,Thinking that his wealth would make him last for ever
  104,4,By no means! He will be sure to be thrown into That which Breaks to Pieces
  104,5,And what will explain to thee That which Breaks to Pieces
  104,6,(It is) the Fire of (the Wrath of) God kindled (to a blaze)
  104,7,The which doth mount (Right) to the Hearts
  104,8,It shall be made into a vault over them
  104,9,In columns outstretched
  105,1,Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the Companions of the Elephant
  105,2,Did He not make their treacherous plan go astray
  105,3,And He sent against them Flights of Birds
  105,4,Striking them with stones of baked clay
  105,5,"Then did He make them like an empty field of stalks and straw, (of which the corn) has been eaten up"
