quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,71,They thought there would be no trial (or punishment); so they became blind and deaf; yet God (in mercy) turned to them; yet again many of them became blind and deaf. But God sees well all that they do
  5,72,"They do blaspheme who say: \"God is Christ the son of Mary.\" But said Christ: \"O Children of Israel! worship God, my Lord and your Lord.\" Whoever joins other gods with God,- God will forbid him the garden, and the Fire will be his abode. There will for the wrong-doers be no one to help"
  5,73,"They do blaspheme who say: God is one of three in a Trinity: for there is no god except One God. If they desist not from their word (of blasphemy), verily a grievous penalty will befall the blasphemers among them"
  5,74,"Why turn they not to God, and seek His forgiveness? For God is Oft- forgiving, Most Merciful"
  5,75,Christ the son of Mary was no more than an apostle; many were the apostles that passed away before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They had both to eat their (daily) food. See how God doth make His signs clear to them; yet see in what ways they are deluded away from the truth
  5,76,"Say: \"Will ye worship, besides God, something which hath no power either to harm or benefit you? But God,- He it is that heareth and knoweth all things"
