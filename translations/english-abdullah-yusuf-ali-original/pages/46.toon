  2,270,"And whatever ye spend in charity or devotion, be sure God knows it all. But the wrong-doers have no helpers"
  2,271,"If ye disclose (acts of) charity, even so it is well, but if ye conceal them, and make them reach those (really) in need, that is best for you: It will remove from you some of your (stains of) evil. And God is well acquainted with what ye do"
  2,272,"It is not required of thee (O Apostle), to set them on the right path, but God sets on the right path whom He pleaseth. Whatever of good ye give benefits your own souls, and ye shall only do so seeking the \"Face\" of God. Whatever good ye give, shall be rendered back to you, and ye shall not Be dealt with unjustly"

Thou shalt know them by their (Unfailing) mark: They beg not importunately from all the sundry. And whatever of good ye give, be assured God knoweth it well"
  2,274,"Those who (in charity) spend of their goods by night and by day, in secret and in public, have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve"
