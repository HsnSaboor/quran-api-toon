quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the break of Day
  89,2,By the Nights twice five
  89,3,By the even and odd (contrasted)
  89,4,And by the Night when it passeth away
  89,5,Is there (not) in these an adjuration (or evidence) for those who understand
  89,6,Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the 'Ad (people)
  89,7,"Of the (city of) Iram, with lofty pillars"
  89,8,The like of which were not produced in (all) the land
  89,9,"And with the Thamud (people), who cut out (huge) rocks in the valley"
  89,10,"And with Pharaoh, lord of stakes"
  89,11,(All) these transgressed beyond bounds in the lands
  89,12,And heaped therein mischief (on mischief)
  89,13,Therefore did thy Lord pour on them a scourge of diverse chastisements
  89,14,For thy Lord is (as a Guardian) on a watch-tower
  89,15,"Now, as for man, when his Lord trieth him, giving him honour and gifts, then saith he, (puffed up), \"My Lord hath honoured me"
  89,16,"But when He trieth him, restricting his subsistence for him, then saith he (in despair), \"My Lord hath humiliated me"
  89,17,"Nay, nay! but ye honour not the orphans"
  89,18,Nor do ye encourage one another to feed the poor
  89,19,And ye devour inheritance - all with greed
  89,20,And ye love wealth with inordinate love
  89,21,Nay! When the earth is pounded to powder
  89,22,"And thy Lord cometh, and His angels, rank upon rank"
  89,23,"And Hell, that Day, is brought (face to face),- on that Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance profit him"
