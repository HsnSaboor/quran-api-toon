quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"Who used to say, 'what! art thou amongst those who bear witness to the Truth (of the Message)"
  37,53,"When we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed receive rewards and punishments"
  37,54,"(A voice) said: \"Would ye like to look down"
  37,55,He looked down and saw him in the midst of the Fire
  37,56,"He said: \"By God! thou wast little short of bringing me to perdition"
  37,57,"Had it not been for the Grace of my Lord, I should certainly have been among those brought (there)"
  37,58,Is it (the case) that we shall not die
  37,59,"Except our first death, and that we shall not be punished"
  37,60,Verily this is the supreme achievement
  37,61,"For the like of this let all strive, who wish to strive"
  37,62,Is that the better entertainment or the Tree of Zaqqum
  37,63,For We have truly made it (as) a trial for the wrong-doers
  37,64,For it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-Fire
  37,65,The shoots of its fruit-stalks are like the heads of devils
  37,66,Truly they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith
  37,67,Then on top of that they will be given a mixture made of boiling water
  37,68,Then shall their return be to the (Blazing) Fire
  37,69,Truly they found their fathers on the wrong Path
  37,70,So they (too) were rushed down on their footsteps
  37,71,"And truly before them, many of the ancients went astray"
  37,72,"But We sent aforetime, among them, (apostles) to admonish them"
  37,73,Then see what was the end of those who were admonished (but heeded not)
  37,74,Except the sincere (and devoted) Servants of God
  37,75,"(In the days of old), Noah cried to Us, and We are the best to hear prayer"
  37,76,And We delivered him and his people from the Great Calamity
