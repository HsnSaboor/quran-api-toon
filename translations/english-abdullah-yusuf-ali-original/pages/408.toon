  30,35,"Or have We sent down authority to them, which points out to them the things to which they pay part-worship"
  30,36,"When We give men a taste of Mercy, they exult thereat: and when some evil afflicts them because of what their (own) hands have sent forth, behold, they are in despair"

  30,41,"Mischief has appeared on land and sea because of (the meed) that the hands of men have earned, that (God) may give them a taste of some of their deeds: in order that they may turn back (from Evil)"
