quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,62,"To you they swear by God. In order to please you: But it is more fitting that they should please God and His Apostle, if they are Believers"
  9,63,"Know they not that for those who oppose God and His Apostle, is the Fire of Hell?- wherein they shall dwell. That is the supreme disgrace"
  9,64,"The Hypocrites are afraid lest a Sura should be sent down about them, showing them what is (really passing) in their hearts. Say: \"Mock ye! But verily God will bring to light all that ye fear (should be revealed)"
  9,65,"If thou dost question them, they declare (with emphasis): \"We were only talking idly and in play.\" Say: \"Was it at God, and His Signs, and His Apostle, that ye were mocking"
  9,66,"Make ye no excuses: ye have rejected Faith after ye had accepted it. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you, for that they are in sin"
  9,67,"The Hypocrites, men and women, (have an understanding) with each other: They enjoin evil, and forbid what is just, and are close with their hands. They have forgotten God; so He hath forgotten them. Verily the Hypocrites are rebellious and per verse"
  9,68,"God hath promised the Hypocrites men and women, and the rejecters, of Faith, the fire of Hell: Therein shall they dwell: Sufficient is it for them: for them is the curse of God, and an enduring punishment"
