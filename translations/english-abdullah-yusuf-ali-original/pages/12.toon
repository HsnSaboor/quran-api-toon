quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  2,77,Know they not that God knoweth what they conceal and what they reveal
  2,78,"And there are among them illiterates, who know not the Book, but (see therein their own) desires, and they do nothing but conjecture"
  2,79,"Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands, and then say:\"This is from God,\" to traffic with it for miserable price!- Woe to them for what their hands do write, and for the gain they make thereby"
  2,80,"And they say: \"The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days:\" Say: \"Have ye taken a promise from God, for He never breaks His promise? or is it that ye say of God what ye do not know"
  2,81,"Nay, those who seek gain in evil, and are girt round by their sins,- they are companions of the Fire: Therein shall they abide (For ever)"
  2,82,"But those who have faith and work righteousness, they are companions of the Garden: Therein shall they abide (For ever)"
  2,83,"And remember We took a covenant from the Children of Israel (to this effect): Worship none but God; treat with kindness your parents and kindred, and orphans and those in need; speak fair to the people; be steadfast in prayer; and practise reg ular charity. Then did ye turn back, except a few among you, and ye backslide (even now)"
