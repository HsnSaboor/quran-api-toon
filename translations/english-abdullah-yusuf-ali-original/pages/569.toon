quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,"Though they will be put in sight of each other,- the sinner's desire will be: Would that he could redeem himself from the Penalty of that Day by (sacrificing) his children"
  70,12,His wife and his brother
  70,13,His kindred who sheltered him
  70,14,"And all, all that is on earth,- so it could deliver him"
  70,15,By no means! for it would be the Fire of Hell
  70,16,Plucking out (his being) right to the skull
  70,17,Inviting (all) such as turn their backs and turn away their faces (from the Right)
  70,18,And collect (wealth) and hide it (from use)
  70,19,Truly man was created very impatient
  70,20,Fretful when evil touches him
  70,21,And niggardly when good reaches him
  70,22,Not so those devoted to Prayer
  70,23,Those who remain steadfast to their prayer
  70,24,And those in whose wealth is a recognised right
  70,25,For the (needy) who asks and him who is prevented (for some reason from asking)
  70,26,And those who hold to the truth of the Day of Judgment
  70,27,And those who fear the displeasure of their Lord
  70,28,For their Lord's displeasure is the opposite of Peace and Tranquillity
  70,29,And those who guard their chastity
  70,30,"Except with their wives and the (captives) whom their right hands possess,- for (then) they are not to be blamed"
  70,31,But those who trespass beyond this are transgressors
  70,32,And those who respect their trusts and covenants
  70,33,And those who stand firm in their testimonies
  70,34,And those who guard (the sacredness) of their worship
  70,35,Such will be the honoured ones in the Gardens (of Bliss)
  70,36,Now what is the matter with the Unbelievers that they rush madly before thee
  70,37,"From the right and from the left, in crowds"
  70,38,Does every man of them long to enter the Garden of Bliss
  70,39,By no means! For We have created them out of the (base matter) they know
