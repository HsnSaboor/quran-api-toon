quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,125,"Those whom God (in His plan) willeth to guide,- He openeth their breast to Islam; those whom He willeth to leave straying,- He maketh their breast close and constricted, as if they had to climb up to the skies: thus doth God (heap) the penalty on those who refuse to believe"
  6,126,"This is the way of thy Lord, leading straight: We have detailed the signs for those who receive admonition"
  6,127,"For them will be a home of peace in the presence of their Lord: He will be their friend, because they practised (righteousness)"
  6,128,"One day will He gather them all together, (and say): \"O ye assembly of Jinns! Much (toll) did ye take of men.\" Their friends amongst men will say: \"Our Lord! we made profit from each other: but (alas!) we reached our term - which thou didst ap point for us.\" He will say: \"The Fire be your dwelling-place: you will dwell therein for ever, except as God willeth.\" for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge"
  6,129,"Thus do we make the wrong-doers turn to each other, because of what they earn"
  6,130,"O ye assembly of Jinns and men! came there not unto you apostles from amongst you, setting forth unto you My signs, and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?\" They will say: \"We bear witness against ourselves.\" It was the life of t his world that deceived them. So against themselves will they bear witness that they rejected Faith"
  6,131,"(The apostles were sent) thus, for thy Lord would not destroy for their wrong-doing men's habitations whilst their occupants were unwarned"
