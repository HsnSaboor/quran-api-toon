quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,"Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of God with their goods and their persons. God hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and perso ns than to those who sit (at home). Unto all (in Faith) Hath God promised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a special reward"
  4,96,"Ranks specially bestowed by Him, and Forgiveness and Mercy. For God is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful"
  4,97,"When angels take the souls of those who die in sin against their souls, they say: \"In what (plight) Were ye?\" They reply: \"Weak and oppressed Were we in the earth.\" They say: \"Was not the earth of God spacious enough for you to move yourselves away (From evil)?\" Such men will find their abode in Hell,- What an evil refuge"
  4,98,"Except those who are (really) weak and oppressed - men, women, and children - who have no means in their power, nor (a guide-post) to their way"
  4,99,"For these, there is hope that God will forgive: For God doth blot out (sins) and forgive again and again"
  4,100,"He who forsakes his home in the cause of God, finds in the earth Many a refuge, wide and spacious: Should he die as a refugee from home for God and His Apostle, His reward becomes due and sure with God: And God is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful"
  4,101,"When ye travel through the earth, there is no blame on you if ye shorten your prayers, for fear the Unbelievers May attack you: For the Unbelievers are unto you open enemies"
