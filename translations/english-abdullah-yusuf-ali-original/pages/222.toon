quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,6,"There is no moving creature on earth but its sustenance dependeth on God: He knoweth the time and place of its definite abode and its temporary deposit: All is in a clear Record"
  11,7,"He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days - and His Throne was over the waters - that He might try you, which of you is best in conduct. But if thou wert to say to them, \"Ye shall indeed be raised up after death\", the Unbelieve rs would be sure to say, \"This is nothing but obvious sorcery"
  11,8,"If We delay the penalty for them for a definite term, they are sure to say, \"What keeps it back?\" Ah! On the day it (actually) reaches them, nothing will turn it away from them, and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock at"
  11,9,"If We give man a taste of Mercy from Ourselves, and then withdraw it from him, behold! he is in despair and (falls into) blasphemy"
  11,10,"But if We give him a taste of (Our) favours after adversity hath touched him, he is sure to say, \"All evil has departed from me:\" Behold! he falls into exultation and pride"
  11,11,"Not so do those who show patience and constancy, and work righteousness; for them is forgiveness (of sins) and a great reward"
  11,12,"Perchance thou mayest (feel the inclination) to give up a part of what is revealed unto thee, and thy heart feeleth straitened lest they say, \"Why is not a treasure sent down unto him, or why does not an angel come down with him?\" But thou art there only to warn! It is God that arrangeth all affairs"
