quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  70,40,Now I do call to witness the Lord of all points in the East and the West that We can certainly
  70,41,Substitute for them better (men) than they; And We are not to be defeated (in Our Plan)
  70,42,"So leave them to plunge in vain talk and play about, until they encounter that Day of theirs which they have been promised"
  70,43,The Day whereon they will issue from their sepulchres in sudden haste as if they were rushing to a goal-post (fixed for them)
  70,44,"Their eyes lowered in dejection,- ignominy covering them (all over)! such is the Day the which they are promised"
  71,1,"We sent Noah to his People (with the Command): \"Do thou warn thy People before there comes to them a grievous Penalty"
  71,2,"He said: \"O my People! I am to you a Warner, clear and open"
  71,3,"That ye should worship God, fear Him and obey me"
  71,4,"So He may forgive you your sins and give you respite for a stated Term: for when the Term given by God is accomplished, it cannot be put forward: if ye only knew"
  71,5,"He said: \"O my Lord! I have called to my People night and day"
  71,6,But my call only increases (their) flight (from the Right)
  71,7,"And every time I have called to them, that Thou mightest forgive them, they have (only) thrust their fingers into their ears, covered themselves up with their garments, grown obstinate, and given themselves up to arrogance"
  71,8,So I have called to them aloud
  71,9,Further I have spoken to them in public and secretly in private
  71,10,"Saying, 'Ask forgiveness from your Lord; for He is Oft-Forgiving"
