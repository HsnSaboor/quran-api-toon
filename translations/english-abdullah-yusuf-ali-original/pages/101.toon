quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"(These are) the ones who wait and watch about you: if ye do gain a victory from God, they say: \"Were we not with you?\"- but if the unbelievers gain a success, they say (to them): \"Did we not gain an advantage over you, and did we not guard you from the believers?\" but God will judge betwixt you on the Day of Judgment. And never will God grant to the unbelievers a way (to triumphs) over the believers"
  4,142,"The Hypocrites - they think they are over-reaching God, but He will over- reach them: When they stand up to prayer, they stand without earnestness, to be seen of men, but little do they hold God in remembrance"
  4,143,"(They are) distracted in mind even in the midst of it,- being (sincerely) for neither one group nor for another whom God leaves straying,- never wilt thou find for him the way"
  4,144,"O ye who believe! Take not for friends unbelievers rather than believers: Do ye wish to offer God an open proof against yourselves"
  4,145,"The Hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire: no helper wilt thou find for them"
  4,146,"Except for those who repent, mend (their lives) hold fast to God, and purify their religion as in God's sight: if so they will be (numbered) with the believers. And soon will God grant to the believers a reward of immense value"
  4,147,"What can God gain by your punishment, if ye are grateful and ye believe? Nay, it is God that recogniseth (all good), and knoweth all things"
