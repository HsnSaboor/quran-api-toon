quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,Then will no intercession of (any) intercessors profit them
  74,49,Then what is the matter with them that they turn away from admonition
  74,50,As if they were affrighted asses
  74,51,Fleeing from a lion
  74,52,"Forsooth, each one of them wants to be given scrolls (of revelation) spread out"
  74,53,By no means! But they fear not the Hereafter
  74,54,"Nay, this surely is an admonition"
  74,55,"Let any who will, keep it in remembrance"
  74,56,"But none will keep it in remembrance except as God wills: He is the Lord of Righteousness, and the Lord of Forgiveness"
  75,1,I do call to witness the Resurrection Day
  75,2,"And I do call to witness the self-reproaching spirit: (Eschew Evil)"
  75,3,Does man think that We cannot assemble his bones
  75,4,"Nay, We are able to put together in perfect order the very tips of his fingers"
  75,5,But man wishes to do wrong (even) in the time in front of him
  75,6,"He questions: \"When is the Day of Resurrection"
  75,7,"At length, when the sight is dazed"
  75,8,And the moon is buried in darkness
  75,9,And the sun and moon are joined together
  75,10,"That Day will Man say: \"Where is the refuge"
  75,11,By no means! No place of safety
  75,12,"Before thy Lord (alone), that Day will be the place of rest"
  75,13,"That Day will Man be told (all) that he put forward, and all that he put back"
  75,14,"Nay, man will be evidence against himself"
  75,15,Even though he were to put up his excuses
  75,16,Move not thy tongue concerning the (Qur'an) to make haste therewith
  75,17,It is for Us to collect it and to promulgate it
  75,18,"But when We have promulgated it, follow thou its recital (as promulgated)"
  75,19,"Nay more, it is for Us to explain it (and make it clear)"
