quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,"Those who believe not in the Hereafter, name the angels with female names"
  53,28,But they have no knowledge therein. They follow nothing but conjecture; and conjecture avails nothing against Truth
  53,29,Therefore shun those who turn away from Our Message and desire nothing but the life of this world
  53,30,"That is as far as knowledge will reach them. Verily thy Lord knoweth best those who stray from His Path, and He knoweth best those who receive guidance"
  53,31,"Yea, to God belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: so that He rewards those who do evil, according to their deeds, and He rewards those who do good, with what is best"
  53,32,"Those who avoid great sins and shameful deeds, only (falling into) small faults,- verily thy Lord is ample in forgiveness. He knows you well when He brings you out of the earth, And when ye are hidden in your mothers' wombs. Therefore justify not yourselves: He knows best who it is that guards against evil"
  53,33,Seest thou one who turns back
  53,34,"Gives a little, then hardens (his heart)"
  53,35,What! Has he knowledge of the Unseen so that he can see
  53,36,"Nay, is he not acquainted with what is in the Books of Moses"
  53,37,And of Abraham who fulfilled his engagements
  53,38,"Namely, that no bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another"
  53,39,That man can have nothing but what he strives for
  53,40,That (the fruit of) his striving will soon come in sight
  53,41,Then will he be rewarded with a reward complete
  53,42,That to thy Lord is the final Goal
  53,43,That it is He Who granteth Laughter and Tears
  53,44,That it is He Who granteth Death and Life
