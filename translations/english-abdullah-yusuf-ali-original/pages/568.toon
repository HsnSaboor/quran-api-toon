quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,So no friend hath he here this Day
  69,36,Nor hath he any food except the corruption from the washing of wounds
  69,37,Which none do eat but those in sin
  69,38,So I do call to witness what ye see
  69,39,And what ye see not
  69,40,That this is verily the word of an honoured apostle
  69,41,"It is not the word of a poet: little it is ye believe"
  69,42,"Nor is it the word of a soothsayer: little admonition it is ye receive"
  69,43,(This is) a Message sent down from the Lord of the Worlds
  69,44,And if the apostle were to invent any sayings in Our name
  69,45,We should certainly seize him by his right hand
  69,46,And We should certainly then cut off the artery of his heart
  69,47,Nor could any of you withhold him (from Our wrath)
  69,48,But verily this is a Message for the God-fearing
  69,49,And We certainly know that there are amongst you those that reject (it)
  69,50,But truly (Revelation) is a cause of sorrow for the Unbelievers
  69,51,But verily it is Truth of assured certainty
  69,52,So glorify the name of thy Lord Most High
  70,1,A questioner asked about a Penalty to befall
  70,2,"The Unbelievers, the which there is none to ward off"
  70,3,"(A Penalty) from God, Lord of the Ways of Ascent"
  70,4,The angels and the spirit ascend unto him in a Day the measure whereof is (as) fifty thousand years
  70,5,"Therefore do thou hold Patience,- a Patience of beautiful (contentment)"
  70,6,They see the (Day) indeed as a far-off (event)
  70,7,But We see it (quite) near
  70,8,The Day that the sky will be like molten brass
  70,9,And the mountains will be like wool
  70,10,And no friend will ask after a friend
