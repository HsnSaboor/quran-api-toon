quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"Say: \"I have no power over any good or harm to myself except as God willeth. If I had knowledge of the unseen, I should have multiplied all good, and no evil should have touched me: I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings to those who have faith"
  7,189,"It is He Who created you from a single person, and made his mate of like nature, in order that he might dwell with her (in love). When they are united, she bears a light burden and carries it about (unnoticed). When she grows heavy, they both pray to God their Lord, (saying): \"If Thou givest us a goodly child, we vow we shall (ever) be grateful"
  7,190,"But when He giveth them a goodly child, they ascribe to others a share in the gift they have received: but God is exalted high above the partners they ascribe to Him"
  7,191,"Do they indeed ascribe to Him as partners things that can create nothing, but are themselves created"
  7,192,"No aid can they give them, nor can they aid themselves"
  7,193,"If ye call them to guidance, they will not obey: For you it is the same whether ye call them or ye hold your peace"
  7,194,"Verily those whom ye call upon besides God are servants like unto you: Call upon them, and let them listen to your prayer, if ye are (indeed) truthful"
  7,195,"Have they feet to walk with? Or hands to lay hold with? Or eyes to see with? Or ears to hear with? Say: \"Call your 'god-partners', scheme (your worst) against me, and give me no respite"
