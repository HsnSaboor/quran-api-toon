quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  35,19,The blind and the seeing are not alike
  35,20,Nor are the depths of Darkness and the Light
  35,21,Nor are the (chilly) shade and the (genial) heat of the sun
  35,22,Nor are alike those that are living and those that are dead. God can make any that He wills to hear; but thou canst not make those to hear who are (buried) in graves
  35,23,Thou art no other than a warner
  35,24,"Verily We have sent thee in truth, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner: and there never was a people, without a warner having lived among them (in the past)"
  35,25,"And if they reject thee, so did their predecessors, to whom came their apostles with Clear Signs, Books of dark prophecies, and the Book of Enlightenment"
  35,26,"In the end did I punish those who rejected Faith: and how (terrible) was My rejection (of them)"
  35,27,"Seest thou not that God sends down rain from the sky? With it We then bring out produce of various colours. And in the mountains are tracts white and red, of various shades of colour, and black intense in hue"
  35,28,"And so amongst men and crawling creatures and cattle, are they of various colours. Those truly fear God, among His Servants, who have knowledge: for God is Exalted in Might, Oft-Forgiving"
  35,29,"Those who rehearse the Book of God, establish regular Prayer, and spend (in Charity) out of what We have provided for them, secretly and openly, hope for a commerce that will never fail"
  35,30,"For He will pay them their meed, nay, He will give them (even) more out of His Bounty: for He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate (service)"
