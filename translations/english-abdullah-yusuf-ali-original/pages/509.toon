quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"Those who believe say, \"Why is not a sura sent down (for us)?\" But when a sura of basic or categorical meaning is revealed, and fighting is mentioned therein, thou wilt see those in whose hearts is a disease looking at thee with a look of one i n swoon at the approach of death. But more fitting for them"
  47,21,"Were it to obey and say what is just, and when a matter is resolved on, it were best for them if they were true to God"
  47,22,"Then, is it to be expected of you, if ye were put in authority, that ye will do mischief in the land, and break your ties of kith and kin"
  47,23,Such are the men whom God has cursed for He has made them deaf and blinded their sight
  47,24,"Do they not then earnestly seek to understand the Qur'an, or are their hearts locked up by them"
  47,25,"Those who turn back as apostates after Guidance was clearly shown to them,- the Evil One has instigated them and busied them up with false hopes"
  47,26,"This, because they said to those who hate what God has revealed, \"We will obey you in part of (this) matter\"; but God knows their (inner) secrets"
  47,27,"But how (will it be) when the angels take their souls at death, and smite their faces and their backs"
  47,28,"This because they followed that which called forth the Wrath of God, and they hated God's good pleasure; so He made their deeds of no effect"
  47,29,"Or do those in whose hearts is a disease, think that God will not bring to light all their rancour"
