  17,59,"And We refrain from sending the signs, only because the men of former generations treated them as false: We sent the she-camel to the Thamud to open their eyes, but they treated her wrongfully: We only send the Signs by way of terror (and warn ing from evil)"
  17,60,"Behold! We told thee that thy Lord doth encompass mankind round about: We granted the vision which We showed thee, but as a trial for men,- as also the Cursed Tree (mentioned) in the Qur'an: We put terror (and warning) into them, but it only increases their inordinate transgression"
  17,61,"Behold! We said to the angels: \"Bow down unto Adam\": They bowed down except Iblis: He said, \"Shall I bow down to one whom Thou didst create from clay"

  17,63,"(God) said: \"Go thy way; if any of them follow thee, verily Hell will be the recompense of you (all)- an ample recompense"
  17,64,"Lead to destruction those whom thou canst among them, with thy (seductive) voice; make assaults on them with thy cavalry and thy infantry; mutually share with them wealth and children; and make promises to them.\" But Satan promises them nothi ng but deceit"

  17,66,"Your Lord is He That maketh the Ship go smoothly for you through the sea, in order that ye may seek of his Bounty. For he is unto you most Merciful"
