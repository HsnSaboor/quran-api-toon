quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,114,"Said Jesus the son of Mary: \"O God our Lord! Send us from heaven a table set (with viands), that there may be for us - for the first and the last of us - a solemn festival and a sign from thee; and provide for our sustenance, for thou art the best Sustainer (of our needs)"
  5,115,"God said: \"I will send it down unto you: But if any of you after that resisteth faith, I will punish him with a penalty such as I have not inflicted on any one among all the peoples"
  5,116,"And behold! God will say: \"O Jesus the son of Mary! Didst thou say unto men, worship me and my mother as gods in derogation of God'?\" He will say: \"Glory to Thee! never could I say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, thou wouldst indeed have known it. Thou knowest what is in my heart, Thou I know not what is in Thine. For Thou knowest in full all that is hidden"
  5,117,"Never said I to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say, to wit, 'worship God, my Lord and your Lord'; and I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them; when Thou didst take me up Thou wast the Watcher over them, and Thou art a witness to all things"
  5,118,"If Thou dost punish them, they are Thy servant: If Thou dost forgive them, Thou art the Exalted in power, the Wise"
  5,119,"God will say: \"This is a day on which the truthful will profit from their truth: theirs are gardens, with rivers flowing beneath,- their eternal Home: God well-pleased with them, and they with God: That is the great salvation, (the fulfilment of all desires)"
  5,120,"To God doth belong the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, and it is He Who hath power over all things"
