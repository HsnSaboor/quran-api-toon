quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  28,60,"The (material) things which ye are given are but the conveniences of this life and the glitter thereof; but that which is with God is better and more enduring: will ye not then be wise"
  28,61,"Are (these two) alike?- one to whom We have made a goodly promise, and who is going to reach its (fulfilment), and one to whom We have given the good things of this life, but who, on the Day of Judgment, is to be among those brought up (for pu nishment)"
  28,62,"That Day (God) will call to them, and say \"Where are my 'partners'?- whom ye imagined (to be such)"
  28,63,"Those against whom the charge will be proved, will say: \"Our Lord! These are the ones whom we led astray: we led them astray, as we were astray ourselves: we free ourselves (from them) in Thy presence: it was not us they worshipped"
  28,64,"It will be said (to them): \"Call upon your 'partners' (for help)\" :they will call upon them, but they will not listen to them; and they will see the Penalty (before them); (how they will wish) 'if only they had been open to guidance"
  28,65,"That Day (God) will call to them, and say: \"What was the answer ye gave to the apostles"
  28,66,Then the (whole) story that Day will seem obscure to them (like light to the blind) and they will not be able (even) to question each other
  28,67,"But any that (in this life) had repented, believed, and worked righteousness, will have hopes to be among those who achieve salvation"
  28,68,"Thy Lord does create and choose as He pleases: no choice have they (in the matter): Glory to God! and far is He above the partners they ascribe (to Him)"
  28,69,And thy Lord knows all that their hearts conceal and all that they reveal
  28,70,"And He is God: There is no god but He. To Him be praise, at the first and at the last: for Him is the Command, and to Him shall ye (all) be brought back"
