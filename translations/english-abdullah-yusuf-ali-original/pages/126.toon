  5,109,"One day will God gather the apostles together, and ask: \"What was the response ye received (from men to your teaching)?\" They will say: \"We have no knowledge: it is Thou Who knowest in full all that is hidden"
  5,110,"Then will God say: \"O Jesus the son of Mary! Recount My favour to thee and to thy mother. Behold! I strengthened thee with the holy spirit, so that thou didst speak to the people in childhood and in maturity. Behold! I taught thee the Book and Wisdom, the Law and the Gospel and behold! thou makest out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My leave, and thou breathest into it and it becometh a bird by My leave, and thou healest those born blind, and the lepers, by My leave. And behold ! thou bringest forth the dead by My leave. And behold! I did restrain the Children of Israel from (violence to) thee when thou didst show them the clear Signs, and the unbelievers among them said: 'This is nothing but evident magic"
  5,111,"And behold! I inspired the disciples to have faith in Me and Mine Apostle: they said, 'We have faith, and do thou bear witness that we bow to God as Muslims"
  5,112,"Behold! the disciples, said: \"O Jesus the son of Mary! can thy Lord send down to us a table set (with viands) from heaven?\" Said Jesus: \"Fear God, if ye have faith"
  5,113,"They said: \"We only wish to eat thereof and satisfy our hearts, and to know that thou hast indeed told us the truth; and that we ourselves may be witnesses to the miracle"
