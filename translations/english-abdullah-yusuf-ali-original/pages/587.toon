  82,1,When the Sky is cleft asunder
  82,2,When the Stars are scattered
  82,3,When the Oceans are suffered to burst forth
  82,4,And when the Graves are turned upside down
  82,5,(Then) shall each soul know what it hath sent forward and (what it hath) kept back
  82,6,O man! What has seduced thee from thy Lord Most Beneficent
  82,7,"Him Who created thee. Fashioned thee in due proportion, and gave thee a just bias"
  82,8,"In whatever Form He wills, does He put thee together"
  82,9,Day! nit ye do reject Right and Judgment
  82,10,But verily over you (are appointed angels) to protect you
  82,11,"Kind and honourable,- Writing down (your deeds)"
  82,12,They know (and understand) all that ye do
  82,13,"As for the Righteous, they will be in bliss"
  82,14,And the Wicked - they will be in the Fire
  82,15,Which they will enter on the Day of Judgment
  82,16,And they will not be able to keep away therefrom
  82,17,And what will explain to thee what the Day of Judgment is
  82,18,"Again, what will explain to thee what the Day of Judgment is"
  82,19,"(It will be) the Day when no soul shall have power (to do) aught for another: For the command, that Day, will be (wholly) with God"
  83,1,Woe to those that deal in fraud
  83,2,"Those who, when they have to receive by measure from men, exact full measure"
  83,3,"But when they have to give by measure or weight to men, give less than due"
  83,4,Do they not think that they will be called to account
  83,5,On a Mighty Day
  83,6,A Day when (all) mankind will stand before the Lord of the Worlds
