quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  48,10,"Verily those who plight their fealty to thee do no less than plight their fealty to God: the Hand of God is over their hands: then any one who violates his oath, does so to the harm of his own soul, and any one who fulfils what he has covenante d with God,- God will soon grant him a great Reward"
  48,11,"The desert Arabs who lagged behind will say to thee: \"We were engaged in (looking after) our flocks and herds, and our families: do thou then ask forgiveness for us.\" They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: \"Who then has any power at all (to intervene) on your behalf with God, if His Will is to give you some loss or to give you some profit? But God is well acquainted with all that ye do"
  48,12,"Nay, ye thought that the Apostle and the Believers would never return to their families; this seemed pleasing in your hearts, and ye conceived an evil thought, for ye are a people lost (in wickedness)"
  48,13,"And if any believe not in God and His Apostle, We have prepared, for those who reject God, a Blazing Fire"
  48,14,"To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills: but God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  48,15,"Those who lagged behind (will say), when ye (are free to) march and take booty (in war): \"Permit us to follow you.\" They wish to change God's decree: Say: \"Not thus will ye follow us: God has already declared (this) beforehand\": then they will say, \"But ye are jealous of us.\" Nay, but little do they understand (such things)"
