  53,46,From a seed when lodged (in its place)
  53,47,That He hath promised a Second Creation (Raising of the Dead)
  53,48,That it is He Who giveth wealth and satisfaction
  53,49,That He is the Lord of Sirius (the Mighty Star)
  53,50,And that it is He Who destroyed the (powerful) ancient 'Ad (people)
  53,51,And the Thamud nor gave them a lease of perpetual life
  53,52,"And before them, the people of Noah, for that they were (all) most unjust and most insolent transgressors"

  54,5,Mature wisdom;- but (the preaching of) Warners profits them not
  54,6,"Therefore, (O Prophet,) turn away from them. The Day that the Caller will call (them) to a terrible affair"
