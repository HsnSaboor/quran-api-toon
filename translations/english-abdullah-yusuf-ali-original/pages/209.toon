  10,7,"Those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present, and those who heed not Our Signs"
  10,8,"Their abode is the Fire, because of the (evil) they earned"
  10,9,"Those who believe, and work righteousness,- their Lord will guide them because of their faith: beneath them will flow rivers in gardens of bliss"
  10,10,"(This will be) their cry therein: \"Glory to Thee, O God!\" And \"Peace\" will be their greeting therein! and the close of their cry will be: \"Praise be to God, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds"
  10,11,"If God were to hasten for men the ill (they have earned) as they would fain hasten on the good,- then would their respite be settled at once. But We leave those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, in their trespasses, wandering in distraction to and fro"
  10,12,"When trouble toucheth a man, He crieth unto Us (in all postures)- lying down on his side, or sitting, or standing. But when We have solved his trouble, he passeth on his way as if he had never cried to Us for a trouble that touched him! thus d o the deeds of transgressors seem fair in their eyes"
  10,13,"Generations before you We destroyed when they did wrong: their apostles came to them with clear-signs, but they would not believe! thus do We requite those who sin"
  10,14,"Then We made you heirs in the land after them, to see how ye would behave"
