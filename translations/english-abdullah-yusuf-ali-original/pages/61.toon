quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,84,"Say: \"We believe in God, and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in (the Books) given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord: We make no distinction between one and another among them, and to God do we bow our will (in Islam)"
  3,85,"If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to God), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good)"
  3,86,How shall God Guide those who reject Faith after they accepted it and bore witness that the Apostle was true and that Clear Signs had come unto them? but God guides not a people unjust
  3,87,"Of such the reward is that on them (rests) the curse of God, of His angels, and of all mankind"
  3,88,"In that will they dwell; nor will their penalty be lightened, nor respite be (their lot)"
  3,89,"Except for those that repent (Even) after that, and make amends; for verily God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
  3,90,"But those who reject Faith after they accepted it, and then go on adding to their defiance of Faith,- never will their repentance be accepted; for they are those who have (of set purpose) gone astray"
  3,91,"As to those who reject Faith, and die rejecting,- never would be accepted from any such as much gold as the earth contains, though they should offer it for ransom. For such is (in store) a penalty grievous, and they will find no helpers"
