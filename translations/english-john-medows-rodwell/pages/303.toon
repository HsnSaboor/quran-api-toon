quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  18,84,"We stablished his power upon the earth, and made for him a way to everything"
  18,85,And a route he followed
  18,86,"Until when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it to set in a miry fount; and hard by he found a people. We said, \"O Dhoulkarnain! either chastise or treat them generously"
  18,87,"The impious,\" said he, \"will we surely chastise;\" then shall he be taken back to his Lord, and he will chastise him with a grievous chastisement"
  18,88,"But as to him who believeth and doeth that which is right, he shall have a generous recompense, and we will lay on them our easy behests"
  18,89,Then followed he a route
  18,90,Until when he reached the rising of the sun he found it to rise on a people to whom we had given no shelter from it
  18,91,Thus it was. And we had full knowledge of the forces that were with him
  18,92,Then followed he a route
  18,93,"Until he came between the two mountains, beneath which he found a people who scarce understood a language"
  18,94,"They said, \"O Dhoulkarnain! verily, Gog and Magog waste this land; shall we then pay thee tribute, so thou build a rampart between us and them"
  18,95,"He said, \"Better than your tribute is the might wherewith my Lord hath strengthened me; but help me strenuously, and I will set a barrier between you and them"
  18,96,"Bring me blocks of iron,\" - until when it filled the space between the mountain sides - \"Ply,\" said he, \"your bellows,\" - until when he had made it red with heat (fire), he said, - \"Bring me molten brass that I may pour upon it"
  18,97,"And Gog and Magog were not able to scale it, neither were they able to dig through it"
