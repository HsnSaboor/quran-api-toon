  37,52,"Who said, 'Art thou of those who credit it"
  37,53,"What! when we shall have died, and become dust and bones, shall we indeed be judged"
  37,54,"He shall say to those around him, \"Will ye look"
  37,55,And he shall look and see him in the midst of Hell
  37,56,"And he shall say to him, \"By God, thou hadst almost caused me to perish"
  37,57,"And, but for the favour of my Lord, I had surely been of those who have been brought with thee into torment"
  37,58,"But do we not die,\" say the blessed"
  37,59,Any other than our first death? and have we escaped the torment
  37,60,This truly is the great felicity
  37,61,For the like of this should the travailers travail
  37,62,Is this the better repast or the tree Ez-zakkoum
  37,63,"Verily, we have made it for a subject of discord to the wicked"
  37,64,It is a tree which cometh up from the bottom of hell
  37,65,Its fruits is as it were the heads of Satans
  37,66,"And, lo! the damned shall surely eat of it and fill their bellies with it"
  37,67,"Then shall they have, thereon, a mixture of boiling water"
  37,68,Then shall they return to hell
  37,69,They found their fathers erring
  37,70,And they hastened on in their footsteps
  37,71,Also before them the greater number of the ancients had erred
  37,72,Though we had sent warners among them
  37,73,But see what was the end of these warned ones
  37,74,Except of God's true servants
  37,75,"Noah called on us of old, and right prompt were we to hear him"
  37,76,And we saved him and his family out of the great distress
