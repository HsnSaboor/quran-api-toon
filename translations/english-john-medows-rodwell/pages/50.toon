  3,5,"God! nought that is in Earth or that is in Heaven, is hidden unto Him"
  3,6,"He it is who formeth you in your mothers' wombs. There is no god but He; the Mighty, the Wise"

  3,9,"O our Lord! For the day of whose coming there is not a doubt, thou wilt surely gather mankind together. Verily, God will not fail the promise"
