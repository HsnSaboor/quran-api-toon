quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  24,28,"And if ye find no one therein, then enter it not till leave be given you; and if it be said to you, \"Go ye back,\" then go ye back. This will be more blameless in you, and God knoweth what ye do"
  24,29,"There shall be no harm in your entering houses in which no one dwelleth, for the supply of your needs: and God knoweth what ye do openly and what ye hide"
  24,30,Speak unto the believers that they restrain their eyes and observe continence. Thus will they be more pure. God is well aware of what they do
  24,31,"And speak to the believing women that they refrain their eyes, and observe continence; and that they display not their ornaments, except those which are external; and that they throw their veils over their bosoms, and display not their ornaments, except to their husbands or their fathers, or their husbands' fathers, or their sons, or their husbands' sons, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or their slaves, or male domestics who have no natural force, or to children who note not women's nakedness. And let them not strike their feet together, so as to discover their hidden ornaments. And be ye all turned to God, O ye Believers! that it may be well with you"
