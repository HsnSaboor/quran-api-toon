quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"Said he, \"And what, O messengers, is your errand"
  51,32,"They said, \"To a wicked people are we sent"
  51,33,To hurl upon them stones of clay
  51,34,Destined by thy Lord for men guilty of excesses
  51,35,And we brought forth the believers who were in the city
  51,36,But we found not in it but one family of Muslims
  51,37,And signs we left in it for those who dread the afflictive chastisement
  51,38,"And in Moses: when we sent him to Pharaoh with manifest power"
  51,39,"But relying on his forces he turned his back and said, \"Sorcerer, or Possessed"
  51,40,So we seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea; for of all blame was he worthy
  51,41,"And in Ad: when we sent against them the desolating blast"
  51,42,"It touched not aught over which it came, but it turned it to dust"
  51,43,"And in Themoud: when it was said to them, \"Enjoy yourselves for yet a while"
  51,44,"But they rebelled against their Lord's command: so the tempest took them as they watched its coming"
  51,45,"They were not able to stand upright, and could not help themselves"
  51,46,"And we destroyed the people of Noah, before them; for an impious people were they"
  51,47,"And the Heaven - with our hands have we built it up, and given it its expanse"
  51,48,And the Earth - we have stretched it out like a carpet; and how smoothly have we spread it forth
  51,49,"And of everything have we created pairs: that haply ye may reflect"
  51,50,"Fly then to God: I come to you from him a plain warner"
  51,51,"And set not up another god with God: I come to you from him a plain warner"
