quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,58,"Nor those who when ye call to prayer, make it an object of raillery and derision. This they do because they are a people who understand not"
  5,59,"SAY: O people of the Book! do ye not disavow us only because we believe in God, and in what He hath sent down to us, and in what He hath sent down aforetime, and because most of you are doers of ill"
  5,60,"SAY: Can I announce to you any retribution worse than that which awaiteth them with God? They whom God hath cursed and with whom He hath been angry - some of them hath He changed into apes and swine; and they who worship Thagout are in evil plight, and have gone far astray from the right path"
  5,61,"When they presented themselves to you they said, \"We believe;\" but Infidels they came in unto you, and Infidels they went forth! God well knew what they concealed"
  5,62,"Many of them shalt thou see hastening together to wickedness and malice, and to eat unlawful things. Shame on them for what they have done"
  5,63,"Had not their doctors and teachers forbidden their uttering wickedness, and their eating unlawful food, bad indeed would have been their doings"
  5,64,"The hand of God,\" say the Jews, \"is chained up.\" Their own hands shall be chained up - and for that which they have said shall they be cursed. Nay! outstretched are both His hands!

That which hath been sent down to thee from thy Lord will surely increase the rebellion and unbelief of many of them; and we have put enmity and hatred between them that shall last till the day of the Resurrection. Oft as they kindle a beacon fire for war shall God quench it! and their aim will be to abet disorder on the earth: but God loveth not the abettors of disorder"
