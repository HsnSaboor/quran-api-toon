quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  48,16,"SAY to those Arabs of the desert, who took not the field, ye shall be called forth against a people of mighty valour. Ye shall do battle with them, or they shall profess Islam. If ye obey, a goodly recompense will God give you; but if ye turn back, as ye turned back aforetime, He will chastise you with a sore chastisement"
  48,17,"It shall be no crime on the part of the blind, the lame, or the sick, if they go not to the fight. But whoso shall obey God and His Apostle, he shall bring him into the gardens 'neath which the rivers flow: but whoso shall turn back, He will punish him with a sore punishment"
  48,18,"Well pleased now hath God been with the believers when they plighted fealty to thee under the tree; and He knew what was in their hearts: therefore did He send down upon them a spirit of secure repose, and rewarded them with a speedy victory"
  48,19,"And with the rich booty which they took: for God is Mighty, Wise"
  48,20,"God promised you the taking of a rich booty and sped it to you; and He withheld men's hands from you, for a sign to the faithful, and that He might guide you along the right way"
  48,21,"And other booty, over which ye have not yet had power: but now hath God compassed them for you; for God is over all things Potent"
  48,22,"If the Infidels shall fight against you, they shall assuredly turn their backs; then, neither protector nor helper shall they find"
  48,23,Such is God's method carried into effect of old; no change canst thou find in God's mode of dealing
