quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,No friend therefore shall he have here this day
  69,36,"Nor food, but corrupt sores"
  69,37,Which none shall eat but the sinners
  69,38,It needs not that I swear by what ye see
  69,39,And by that which ye see not
  69,40,That this verily is the word of an apostle worthy of all honour
  69,41,And that it is not the word of a poet - how little do ye believe
  69,42,Neither is it the word of a soothsayer (Kahin) - how little do ye receive warning
  69,43,It is a missive from the Lord of the worlds
  69,44,But if Muhammad had fabricated concerning us any sayings
  69,45,We had surely seized him by the right hand
  69,46,And had cut through the vein of his neck
  69,47,Nor would We have withheld any one of you from him
  69,48,"But, verily, It (the Koran) is a warning for the God-fearing"
  69,49,And we well know that there are of you who treat it as a falsehood
  69,50,But it shall be the despair of infidels
  69,51,For it is the very truth of sure knowledge
  69,52,"Praise, then, the name of thy Lord, the Great"
  70,1,A SUITOR sued for punishment to light suddenly
  70,2,"On the infidels: none can hinder"
  70,3,"God from inflicting it, the master of those ASCENTS"
  70,4,"By which the angels and the spirit ascend to him in a day, whose length is fifty thousand years"
  70,5,Be thou patient therefore with becoming patience
  70,6,They forsooth regard that day as distant
  70,7,But we see it nigh
  70,8,The day when the heavens shall become as molten brass
  70,9,And the mountains shall become like flocks of wool
  70,10,And friend shall not question of friend
