quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,But ye prefer this present life
  87,17,Though the life to come is better and more enduring
  87,18,This truly is in the Books of old
  87,19,The Books of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,"Hath the tidings of the day that shall OVERSHADOW, reached thee"
  88,2,Downcast on that day shall be the countenances of some
  88,3,Travailing and worn
  88,4,Burnt at the scorching fire
  88,5,Made to drink from a fountain fiercely boiling
  88,6,No food shall they have but the fruit of Darih
  88,7,"Which shall not fatten, nor appease their hunger"
  88,8,"Joyous too, on that day, the countenances of others"
  88,9,Well pleased with their labours past
  88,10,In a lofty garden
  88,11,No vain discourse shalt thou hear therein
  88,12,Therein shall be a gushing fountain
  88,13,Therein shall be raised couches
  88,14,And goblets ready placed
  88,15,And cushions laid in order
  88,16,And carpets spread forth
  88,17,"Can they not look up to the clouds, how they are created"
  88,18,And to the heaven how it is upraised
  88,19,And to the mountains how they are rooted
  88,20,And to the earth how it is outspread
  88,21,Warn thou then; for thou art a warner only
  88,22,Thou hast no authority over them
  88,23,But whoever shall turn back and disbelieve
  88,24,God shall punish him with the greater punishment
  88,25,Verily to Us shall they return
  88,26,Then shall it be Our's to reckon with them
