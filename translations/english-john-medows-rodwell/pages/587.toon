quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,WHEN the Heaven shall CLEAVE asunder
  82,2,And when the stars shall disperse
  82,3,And when the seas shall be commingled
  82,4,And when the graves shall be turned upside down
  82,5,Each soul shall recognise its earliest and its latest actions
  82,6,O man! what hath misled thee against thy generous Lord
  82,7,Who hath created thee and moulded thee and shaped thee aright
  82,8,In the form which pleased Him hath He fashioned thee
  82,9,Even so; but ye treat the Judgment as a lie
  82,10,Yet truly there are guardians over you
  82,11,Illustrious recorders
  82,12,Cognisant of your actions
  82,13,Surely amid delights shall the righteous dwell
  82,14,But verily the impure in Hell-fire
  82,15,They shall be burned at it on the day of doom
  82,16,And they shall not be able to hide themselves from it
  82,17,Who shall teach thee what the day of doom is
  82,18,Once more. Who shall teach thee what the day of doom is
  82,19,"It is a day when one soul shall be powerless for another soul: all sovereignty on that day shall be with God"
  83,1,Woe to those who STINT the measure
  83,2,"Who when they take by measure from others, exact the full"
  83,3,"But when they mete to them or weigh to them, minish"
  83,4,What! have they no thought that they shall be raised again
  83,5,For the great day
  83,6,The day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds
