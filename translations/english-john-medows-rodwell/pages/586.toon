quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,WHEN the sun shall be FOLDED UP
  81,2,And when the stars shall fall
  81,3,And when the mountains shall be set in motion
  81,4,And when the she-camels shall be abandoned
  81,5,And when the wild beasts shall be gathered together
  81,6,And when the seas shall boil
  81,7,And when souls shall be paired with their bodies
  81,8,And when the female child that had been buried alive shall be asked
  81,9,For what crime she was put to death
  81,10,And when the leaves of the Book shall be unrolled
  81,11,And when the Heaven shall be stripped away
  81,12,And when Hell shall be made to blaze
  81,13,And when Paradise shall be brought near
  81,14,Every soul shall know what it hath produced
  81,15,It needs not that I swear by the stars of retrograde motions
  81,16,Which move swiftly and hide themselves away
  81,17,And by the night when it cometh darkening on
  81,18,And by the dawn when it brighteneth
  81,19,That this is the word of an illustrious Messenger
  81,20,"Endued with power, having influence with the Lord of the Throne"
  81,21,"Obeyed there by Angels, faithful to his trust"
  81,22,And your compatriot is not one possessed by djinn
  81,23,For he saw him in the clear horizon
  81,24,Nor doth he grapple with heaven's secrets
  81,25,Nor doth he teach the doctrine of a cursed Satan
  81,26,Whither then are ye going
  81,27,"Verily, this is no other than a warning to all creatures"
  81,28,To him among you who willeth to walk in a straight path
  81,29,"But will it ye shall not, unless as God willeth it, the Lord of the worlds"
