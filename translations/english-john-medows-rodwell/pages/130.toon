quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"SAY: What thing is weightiest in bearing witness? SAY: God is witness between me and you; and this Koran hath been revealed to me that I should warn you by it, and all whom it shall reach. What! will ye really bear witness that there are other gods with God? SAY: I bear no such witness. SAY: Verily, He is one God, and truly am guiltless of what ye join with Him"
  6,20,"They to whom we have given the Book, recognise him (Muhammad) as they do their own children: but they who are the authors of their own perdition are they who will not believe"
  6,21,"And who more wicked than he who inventeth a lie concerning God, or who treateth our signs as lies? Verily those wicked ones shall not prosper"
  6,22,"And on \"the Day\" we will gather them all together: then will we say to those who joined gods with God, \"Where are those companion - gods of yours, as ye supposed them"
  6,23,"Then shall they find no other excuse than to say, \"By God our Lord! we joined not companions with Him"
  6,24,Behold! how they lie against themselves - and the gods of their own inventing desert them
  6,25,"Some among them hearken unto thee: but we have cast veils over their hearts that they should not understand the Koran, and a weight into their ears: and though they should see all kinds of signs, they will refuse all faith in them, until when they come to thee, to dispute with thee, the infidels say, \"Verily, this is nothing but fables of the ancients"
  6,26,"And they will forbid it, and depart from it: - but they are only the authors of their own perdition, and know it not"
  6,27,"If thou couldst see when they shall be set over the fire, and shall say, \"Oh! would we might be sent back! we would not treat the signs of our Lord as lies! we would be of the believers"
