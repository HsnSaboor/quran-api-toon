quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  6,152,"And come not nigh to the substance of the orphan, but to improve it, until he come of age: and use a full measure, and a just balance: We will not task a soul beyond its ability. And when ye give judgment, observe justice, even though it be the affair of a kinsman, and fulfil the covenant of God. This hath God enjoined you for your monition"
  6,153,"And, \"this is my right way.\" Follow it then; and follow not other paths lest ye be scattered from His path. This hath he enjoined you, that ye may fear Him"
  6,154,"Then gave we the Book to Moses - complete for him who should do right, and a decision for all matters, and a guidance, and a mercy, that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord"
  6,155,"Blessed, too, this Book which we have sent down. Wherefore follow it and fear God, that ye may find mercy"
  6,156,"Lest ye should say, \"The Scriptures were indeed sent down only unto two peoples before us, but we were not able to go deep into their studies"
  6,157,"Or lest ye should say, \"If a book had been sent down to us, we had surely followed the guidance better than they.\" But now hath a clear exposition come to you from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy. Who then is more wicked than he who treateth the signs of God as lies, and turneth aside from them? We will recompense those who turn aside from our signs with an evil punishment, because they have turned aside"
