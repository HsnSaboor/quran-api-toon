quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,73,"O Prophet! contend against the infidels and the hypocrites, and be rigorous with them: Hell shall be their dwelling place! Wretched the journey thither"
  9,74,"They swear by God that they said no such thing: yet spake they the word of infidelity, and from Muslims became unbelievers! They planned what they could not effect; and only disapproved of it because God and His Apostle had enriched them by His bounty! If they repent it will be better for them; but if they fall back into their sin, with a grievous chastisement will God chastise them in this world and the next, and on earth they shall have neither friend nor protector"
  9,75,"Some there are of them who made this agreement with God - \"If truly He give us of His bounties, we will surely give alms and surely be of the righteous"
  9,76,"Yet when he had vouchsafed them of His bounty, they became covetous thereof, and turned their backs, and withdrew afar off"
  9,77,"So He caused hypocrisy to take its turn in their hearts, until the day on which they shall meet Him - for that they failed their promise to God, and that they were liars"
  9,78,"Know they not that God knoweth their secrets and their private talk, and that God knoweth the secret things"
  9,79,"They who traduce such of the faithful as give their alms freely, and those who find nothing to give but their earnings, and scoff at them, God shall scoff at them; and there is a grievous torment in store for them"
