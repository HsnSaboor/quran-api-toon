  4,114,"In most of their secret talk is nothing good; but only in his who enjoineth almsgiving, or that which is right, or concord among men. Whoso doth this, out of desire to please God, we will give him at the last a great reward"

  4,116,"God truly will not forgive the joining other gods with Himself. Other sins He will forgive to whom He will: but he who joineth gods with God, hath erred with far-gone error"

  4,118,"On them is the malison of God. For he said, \"A portion of thy servants will I surely take"
  4,119,"and will lead them astray, and will stir desires within them, and will command them and they shall cut the ears of animals; and I will command them, and they shall alter the creation of God.\" He who taketh Satan rather than God for his patron, is ruined with palpable ruin"
  4,120,"He hath made them promises, and he hath stirred desires within them; but Satan promiseth, only to beguile"
