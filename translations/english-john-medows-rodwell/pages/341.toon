  22,74,"Unworthy the estimate they form of God! for God is right Powerful, Mighty"
  22,75,"God chooseth messengers from among the angels and from among men: verily, God Heareth, Seeth"
  22,76,He knoweth what is before them and what is behind them; and unto God shall all things return
  22,77,"Believers! bow down and prostrate yourselves and worship your Lord, and work righteousness that you may fare well"
  22,78,"And do valiantly in the cause of God as it behoveth you to do for Him. He hath elected you, and hath not laid on you any hardship in religion, the Faith of your father Abraham.

Therefore observe prayer, and pay the legal impost, and cleave fast to God. He is your liege Lord - a goodly Lord, and a goodly Helper"
