quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,That this is the honourable Koran
  56,78,Written in the preserved Book
  56,79,Let none touch it but the purified
  56,80,It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
  56,81,Such tidings as these will ye disdain
  56,82,Will ye make it your daily bread to gainsay them
  56,83,"Why, at the moment when the soul of a dying man shall come up into his throat"
  56,84,And when ye are gazing at him
  56,85,"Though we are nearer to him than ye, although ye see us not"
  56,86,"Why do ye not, if ye are to escape the judgment"
  56,87,"Cause that soul to return? Tell me, if ye speak the truth"
  56,88,But as to him who shall enjoy near access to God
  56,89,"His shall be repose, and pleasure, and a garden of delights"
  56,90,"Yea, for him who shall be of the people of the right hand"
  56,91,"Shall be the greeting from the people of the right hand - \"Peace be to thee"

  56,95,Verily this is a certain truth
  56,96,"Praise therefore the name of thy Lord, the Great"
  57,1,"ALL that is in the Heavens and in the Earth praiseth God, and He is the Mighty, the Wise"
  57,2,His the Kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth; He maketh alive and killeth; and He hath power over all things
  57,3,He is the first and the last; the Seen and the Hidden; and He knoweth all things
