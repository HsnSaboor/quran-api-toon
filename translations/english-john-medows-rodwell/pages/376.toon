quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,Of what avail will their enjoyments be to them
  26,208,We never destroyed a city which had not first its warners
  26,209,With admonition; nor did we deal unjustly
  26,210,The Satans were not sent down with this Koran
  26,211,"It beseemed them not, and they had not the power"
  26,212,For they are far removed from hearing it
  26,213,"Call not thou on any other god but God, lest thou be of those consigned to torment"
  26,214,But warn thy relatives of nearer kin
  26,215,And kindly lower thy wing over the faithful who follow thee
  26,216,"And if they disobey thee, then say: \"I will not be answerable for your doings"
  26,217,"And put thy trust in Him that is the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,218,Who seeth thee when thou standest in prayer
  26,219,And thy demeanour amongst those who worship
  26,220,"For He heareth, knoweth all"
  26,221,Shall I tell you on whom Satan descend
  26,222,"They descend on every lying, wicked person"
  26,223,They impart what they have heard; - but most of them are liars
  26,224,It is the POETS whom the erring follow
  26,225,Seest thou not how they rove distraught in every valley
  26,226,And that they say that which they do not
  26,227,"Save those who believe and do good works, and oft remember God; And who defend themselves when unjustly treated. But they who treat them unjustly shall find out what a lot awaiteth them"
