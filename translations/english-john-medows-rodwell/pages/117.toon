quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,51,"O Believers! take not the Jews or Christians as friends. They are but one another's friends. If any one of you taketh them for his friends, he surely is one of them! God will not guide the evil doers"
  5,52,"So shalt thou see the diseased at heart speed away to them, and say, \"We fear lest a change of fortune befall us.\" But haply God will of himself bring about some victory or event of His own ordering: then soon will they repent them of their secret imaginings"
  5,53,"Then will the faithful say, \"What! are these they who swore, by their most solemn oath, that they were surely with you?\" Vain their works; and themselves shall come to ruin"
  5,54,"O ye who believe! should any of you desert His religion, God will then raise up a people loved by Him, and loving Him, lowly towards the faithful, haughty towards the Infidels. For the cause of God will they contend, and not fear the blame of the blamer. This is the Grace of God! On whom He will He bestoweth it! God is Vast, Omniscient"
  5,55,"Verily, your protector is God and His Apostle, and those who believe, who observe prayer, and pay the alms of obligation, and who bow in worship"
  5,56,"And whoso take God and His Apostle, and those who believe for friends, they truly are the people of God; they shall have the upper hand"
  5,57,"O ye who believe! take not such of those who have received the Scriptures before you, as scoff and jest at your religion, or the Infidels, for your friends, but fear God if ye are believers"
