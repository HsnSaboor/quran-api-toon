quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  58,7,"Dost thou not see that God knoweth all that is in the Heavens and all that is in the Earth? Three persons speak not privately together, but He is their fourth; nor five, but He is their sixth; nor fewer nor more, but wherever they be He is with them. Then on the day of resurrection He will tell them of their deeds: for God knoweth all things"
  58,8,"Hast thou not marked those who have been forbidden secret talk, and return to what they have been forbidden, and talk privately together with wickedness, and hate, and disobedience towards the Apostle? And when they come to thee, they greet thee not as God greeteth thee: and they say among themselves, \"Why doth not God punish us for what we say?\" Hell shall be their meed: they shall be burned at its fire: and a wretched passage thither"
  58,9,"O Believers! when ye hold private converse together, let it not be with wickedness, and hate, and disobedience towards the Apostle; but let your private talk be with justice and the fear of God: aye, fear ye God unto whom ye shall be gathered"
  58,10,"Only of Satan is this clandestine talk, that he may bring the faithful to grief: but, unless by God's permission, not aught shall he harm them! in God then let the faithful trust"
  58,11,"O ye who believe! when it is said to you, \"Make room in your assemblies,\" then make ye room. God will make room for you in Paradise! And when it is said to you, \"Rise up,\" then rise ye up. God will uplift those of you who believe, and those to whom \"the Knowledge\" is given, to lofty grades! and God is cognisant of your actions"
