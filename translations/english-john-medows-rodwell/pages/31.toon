  2,197,"Let the Pilgrimage be made in the months already known: whoever therefore undertaketh the Pilgrimage therein, let him not know a woman, nor transgress, nor wrangle in the Pilgrimage.

  2,198,"It shall be no crime in you if ye seek an increase from your Lord; and when ye pour swiftly on from Arafat, then remember God near the holy monument; and remember Him, because He hath guided you who before this were of those who went astray"
  2,199,"Then pass on quickly where the people quickly pass, and ask pardon of God, for God is Forgiving, Merciful"
  2,200,"And when ye have finished your holy rites, remember God as ye remember your own fathers, or with a yet more intense remembrance! Some men there are who say, \"O our Lord! give us our portion in this world:\" but such shall have no portion in the next life"
  2,201,"And some say, \"O our Lord! give us good in this world and good in the next, and keep us from the torment of the fire"
  2,202,"They shall have the lot which they have merited: and God is swift to reckon"
