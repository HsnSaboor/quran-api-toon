quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  48,10,"In truth, they who plighted fealty to thee, really plighted that fealty to God: the hand of God was over their hands! Whoever, therefore, shall break his oath shall only break it to his own hurt; but whoever shall be true to his engagement with God, He will give him a great reward"
  48,11,"The Arabs who took not the field with you, will say to thee, \"We were engaged with our property and our families; therefore ask thou pardon for us.\" They speak with their tongues what is not in their hearts. SAY: And who can have any power over God in your behalf, whether he will you some loss, or whether he will you an advantage? Yes, God is acquainted with your doings"
  48,12,"But ye thought that the Apostle and the faithful could never more come back to their families; and your hearts were pleased at this; and ye thought an evil thought of this expedition, and ye became an undone people"
  48,13,"For, whoso believeth not in God, and His Apostle. . . . Verily, we have got ready the flame for the Infidels"
  48,14,"And God's is the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth: Whom He will He forgiveth, and whom He will He punisheth: and God is Gracious, Merciful"
  48,15,"They who took not the field with you will say, when ye go forth to the spoil to take it, \"Let us follow you.\" Fain would they change the word of God. SAY: Ye shall by no means follow us: thus hath God said already. They will say, \"Nay, ye are jealous of us.\" Nay! they are men of little understanding"
