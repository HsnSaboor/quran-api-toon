  37,2,And by those who repel demons
  37,3,And by those who recite the Koran for warning
  37,4,Truly your God is but one
  37,5,"Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth, and of all that is between them, and Lord of the East"
  37,6,We have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the stars

  37,10,"While, if one steal a word by stealth, a glistening flame pursueth him"
  37,11,"Ask the Meccans then, Are they, or the angels whom we have made, the stronger creation? Aye, of coarse clay have we created them"
