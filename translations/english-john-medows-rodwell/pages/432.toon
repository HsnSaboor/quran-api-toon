  34,32,"Then shall the mighty ones say to the weak, \"What! was it we who turned you aside from the guidance which had reached you? Nay, but ye acted wickedly yourselves"
  34,33,"And the weak shall say to the mighty ones, \"Nay, but there was a plot by night and by day, when ye bad us believe not in God, and gave him peers.\" And they shall proclaim their repentance after they have seen the punishment! And yokes will we place on the necks of those who have not believed! Shall they be rewarded but as they have wrought"
  34,34,"And never have we sent a warner to any city whose opulent men did not say, \"In sooth we disbelieve your message"
  34,35,"And they said, \"We are the more abundant in riches and in children, nor shall we be among the punished"
  34,36,"SAY: Of a truth my Lord will be liberal or sparing in his supplies to whom he pleaseth: but the greater part of men acknowledge it not"
  34,37,"Neither by your riches nor by your children shall you bring yourselves into nearness with Us; but they who believe and do the thing that is right shall have a double reward for what they shall have done: and in the pavilions of Paradise shall they dwell secure"
  34,38,"But they who shall aim to invalidate our signs, shall be consigned to punishment"
  34,39,"SAY: Of a truth my Lord will be liberal in supplies to whom he pleaseth of his servants, or will be sparing to him: and whatever ye shall give in alms he will return; and He is the best dispenser of gifts"
