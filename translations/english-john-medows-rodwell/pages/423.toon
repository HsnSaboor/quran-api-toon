quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,"And it is not for a believer, man or woman, to have any choice in their affairs, when God and His Apostle have decreed a matter: and whoever disobeyeth God and His Apostle, erreth with palpable error"
  33,37,"And, remember, when thou saidst to him unto whom God had shewn favour, and to whom thou also hadst shewn favour, \"Keep thy wife to thyself, and fear God;\" and thou didst hide in thy mind what God would bring to light. and thou didst fear man; but more right had it been to fear God. And when Zaid had settled concerning her to divorce her, we married her to thee, that it might not be a crime in the faithful to marry the wives of their adopted sons, when they have settled the affair concerning them. And the behest of God is to be performed"
  33,38,No blame attacheth to the prophet where God hath given him a permission. Such was the way of God with those prophets who flourished before thee; for God's behest is a fixed decree
  33,39,"Who fulfilled the mission with which God had charged them, and feared Him, and feared none but God. And God taketh a sufficient account"
  33,40,"Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Apostle of God, and the seal of the prophets: and God knoweth all things"
  33,41,O Believers! remember God with frequent remembrance
  33,42,and praise Him morning and evening
  33,43,"He blesseth you, and His angels intercede for you, that He may bring you forth out of darkness into light: and Merciful is He to the Believers"
