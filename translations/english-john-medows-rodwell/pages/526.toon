quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the STAR when it setteth
  53,2,"Your compatriot erreth not, nor is he led astray"
  53,3,Neither speaketh he from mere impulse
  53,4,The Koran is no other than a revelation revealed to him
  53,5,One terrible in power taught it him
  53,6,Endued with wisdom. With even balance stood he
  53,7,In the highest part of the horizon
  53,8,Then came he nearer and approached
  53,9,"And was at the distance of two bows, or even closer"
  53,10,And he revealed to his servant what he revealed
  53,11,His heart falsified not what he saw
  53,12,What! will ye then dispute with him as to what he saw
  53,13,He had seen him also another time
  53,14,"Near the Sidrah-tree, which marks the boundary"
  53,15,Near which is the garden of repose
  53,16,When the Sidrah-tree was covered with what covered it
  53,17,"His eye turned not aside, nor did it wander"
  53,18,For he saw the greatest of the signs of his Lord
  53,19,Do you see Al-Lat and Al-Ozza
  53,20,And Manat the third idol besides
  53,21,What? shall ye have male progeny and God female
  53,22,This were indeed an unfair partition
  53,23,"These are mere names: ye and your fathers named them thus: God hath not sent down any warranty in their regard. A mere conceit and their own impulses do they follow. Yet hath \"the guidance\" from their Lord come to them"
  53,24,Shall man have whatever he wisheth
  53,25,The future and the present are in the hand of God
  53,26,"And many as are the Angels in the Heavens, their intercession shall be of no avail Until God hath permitted it to whom he shall please and will accept"
