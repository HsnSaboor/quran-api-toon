  11,6,"There is no moving thing on earth whose nourishment dependeth not on God; he knoweth its haunts and final resting place: all is in the clear Book"
  11,7,"And He it is who hath made the Heavens and the Earth in six days: His throne had stood ere this upon the waters, that He might make proof which of you would excel in works. And if thou say, \"After death ye shall surely be raised again,\" the infidels will certainly exclaim, \"This is nothing but pure sorcery"
  11,8,"And if we defer their chastisement to some definite time, they will exclaim, \"What keepeth it back?\" What! will it not come upon them on a day when there shall be none to avert it from them? And that at which they scoffed shall enclose them in on every side"
  11,9,"And if we cause man to taste our mercy, and then deprive him of it, verily, he is despairing, ungrateful"
  11,10,"And if after trouble hath befallen him we cause him to taste our favour, he will surely exclaim, \"The evils are passed away from me.\" Verily, he is joyous, boastful"
  11,11,"Except those who endure with patience and do the things that are right: these doth pardon await and a great reward"
  11,12,"Perhaps thou wilt suppress a part of what hath been revealed to thee, and wilt be distress at heart lest they say, \"If a treasure be not sent down to him, or an angel come with him. . . .\" But thou art only a warner, and God hath all things in his charge"
