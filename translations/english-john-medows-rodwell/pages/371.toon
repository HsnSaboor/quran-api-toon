  26,84,And give me a good name among posterity
  26,85,And make me one of the heirs of the garden of delight
  26,86,"And forgive my father, for he was one of the erring"

  26,88,The day when neither wealth nor children shall avail
  26,89,Save to him who shall come to God with a sound heart
  26,90,When Paradise shall be brought near the pious
  26,91,And Hell shall lay open for those who have gone astray

  26,101,Nor friend who careth for us
  26,102,"Could we but return, we would be of the believers"

  26,109,"I ask of you no reward for this, for my reward is of the Lord of the Worlds alone"
  26,110,Fear God then and obey me
