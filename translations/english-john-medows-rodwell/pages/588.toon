quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,Yes! the register of the wicked is in Sidjin
  83,8,And who shall make thee understand what Sidjin is
  83,9,It is a book distinctly written
  83,10,"Woe, on that day, to those who treated our signs as lies"
  83,11,Who treated the day of judgment as a lie
  83,12,"None treat it as a lie, save the transgressor, the criminal"
  83,13,"Who, when our signs are rehearsed to him, saith, \"Tales of the Ancients"
  83,14,Yes; but their own works have got the mastery over their hearts
  83,15,Yes; they shall be shut out as by a veil from their Lord on that day
  83,16,Then shall they be burned in Hell-fire
  83,17,"Then shall it be said to them, \"This is what ye deemed a lie"
  83,18,Even so. But the register of the righteous is in Illiyoun
  83,19,And who shall make thee understand what Illiyoun is
  83,20,A book distinctly written
  83,21,The angels who draw nigh unto God attest it
  83,22,"Surely, among delights shall the righteous dwell"
  83,23,Seated on bridal couches they will gaze around
  83,24,Thou shalt mark in their faces the brightness of delight
  83,25,Choice sealed wine shall be given them to quaff
  83,26,The seal of musk. For this let those pant who pant for bliss
  83,27,Mingled therewith shall be the waters of Tasnim
  83,28,Fount whereof they who draw nigh to God shall drink
  83,29,The sinners indeed laugh the faithful to scorn
  83,30,And when they pass by them they wink at one another
  83,31,"And when they return to their own people, they return jesting"
  83,32,"And when they see them they say, \"These are the erring ones"
  83,33,And yet they have no mission to be their guardians
  83,34,"Therefore, on that day the faithful shall laugh the infidels to scorn"
