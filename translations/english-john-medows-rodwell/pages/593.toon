quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the DAYBREAK
  89,2,and ten nights
  89,3,By that which is double and that which is single
  89,4,By the night when it pursues its course
  89,5,Is there not in this an oath becoming a man of sense
  89,6,Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with Ad
  89,7,At Irem adorned with pillars
  89,8,Whose like have not been reared in these lands
  89,9,And with Themoud who hewed out the rocks in the valley
  89,10,And with Pharaoh the impaler
  89,11,Who all committed excesses in the lands
  89,12,And multiplied wickedness therein
  89,13,Wherefore thy Lord let loose on them the scourge of chastisement
  89,14,For thy Lord standeth on a watch tower
  89,15,"As to man, when his Lord trieth him and honoureth him and is bounteous to him, Then saith he, \"My Lord honoureth me"
  89,16,"But when he proveth him and limiteth his gifts to him, He saith, \"My Lord despiseth me"
  89,17,Aye. But ye honour not the orphan
  89,18,Nor urge ye one another to feed the poor
  89,19,"And ye devour heritages, devouring greedily"
  89,20,And ye love riches with exceeding love
  89,21,"Aye. But when the earth shall be crushed with crushing, crushing"
  89,22,And thy Lord shall come and the angels rank on rank
  89,23,"And Hell on that day shall be moved up, - Man shall on that day remember himself. But how shall remembrance help him"
