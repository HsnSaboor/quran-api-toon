quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Have we not created you of a sorry germ
  77,21,Which we laid up in a secure place
  77,22,Till the term decreed for birth
  77,23,"Such is our power! and, how powerful are We"
  77,24,Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
  77,25,Have we not made the earth to hold
  77,26,The living and the dead
  77,27,"And placed on it the tall firm mountains, and given you to drink of sweet water"
  77,28,Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
  77,29,Begone to that Hell which ye called a lie
  77,30,Begone to the shadows that lie in triple masses
  77,31,But not against the flame shall they shade or help you
  77,32,The sparks which it casteth out are like towers
  77,33,Like tawny camels
  77,34,Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
  77,35,On that day they shall not speak
  77,36,Nor shall it be permitted them to allege excuses
  77,37,Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
  77,38,"This is the day of severing, when we will assemble you and your ancestors"
  77,39,If now ye have any craft try your craft on me
  77,40,Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
  77,41,But the god-fearing shall be placed amid shades and fountains
  77,42,"And fruits, whatsoever they shall desire"
  77,43,"Eat and drink, with health, as the meed of your toils"
  77,44,Thus recompense we the good
  77,45,Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
  77,46,"Eat ye and enjoy yourselves a little while. Verily, ye are doers of evil"
  77,47,Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
  77,48,"For when it is said to them, bend the knee, they bend it not"
  77,49,Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
  77,50,In what other revelation after this will they believe
