quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  29,46,"Dispute not, unless in kindly sort, with the people of the Book; save with such of them as have dealt wrongfully with you: And say ye, \"We believe in what hath been sent down to us and hath been sent down to you. Our God and your God is one, and to him are we self-surrendered\" (Muslims)"
  29,47,"Thus have we sent down the Book of the Koran to thee: and they to whom we have given the Book of the law believe in it: and of these Arabians there are those who believe in it: and none, save the Infidels, reject our signs"
  29,48,"Thou didst not recite any book (of revelation) before it: with that right hand of thine thou didst not transcribe one: else might they who treat it as a vain thing have justly doubted"
  29,49,"But it is a clear sign in the hearts of those whom \"the knowledge\" hath reached. None except the wicked reject our signs"
  29,50,"And they say, \"Unless a sign be sent down to him from his Lord. . . .\" SAY: Signs are in the power of God alone. I am only a plain spoken warner"
  29,51,Is it not enough for them that we have sent down to thee the Book to be recited to them? In this verily is a mercy and a warning to those who believe
  29,52,"SAY: God is witness enough between me and you. He knoweth all that is in the Heavens and the Earth, and they who believe in vain things and disbelieve in God - these shall be the lost ones"
