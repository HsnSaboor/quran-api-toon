quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,I SWEAR by the FIG and by the olive
  95,2,By Mount Sinai
  95,3,And by this inviolate soil
  95,4,That of goodliest fabric we created man
  95,5,Then brought him down to be the lowest of the low
  95,6,"Save who believe and do the things that are right, for theirs shall be a reward that faileth not"
  95,7,"Then, who after this shall make thee treat the Judgment as a lie"
  95,8,What! is not God the most just of judges
  96,1,"RECITE thou, in the name of thy Lord who created"
  96,2,Created man from CLOTS OF BLOOD
  96,3,Recite thou! For thy Lord is the most Beneficent
  96,4,Who hath taught the use of the pen
  96,5,Hath taught Man that which he knoweth not
  96,6,"Nay, verily, Man is insolent"
  96,7,Because he seeth himself possessed of riches
  96,8,"Verily, to thy Lord is the return of all"
  96,9,What thinkest thou of him that holdeth back
  96,10,A servant of God when he prayeth
  96,11,What thinkest thou? Hath he followed the true Guidance
  96,12,or enjoined Piety
  96,13,What thinkest thou? Hath he treated the truth as a lie and turned his back
  96,14,What! doth he not know how that God seeth
  96,15,"Nay, verily, if he desist not, We shall seize him by the forelock"
  96,16,The lying sinful forelock
  96,17,Then let him summon his associates
  96,18,We too will summon the guards of Hell
  96,19,"Nay! obey him not; but adore, and draw nigh to God"
