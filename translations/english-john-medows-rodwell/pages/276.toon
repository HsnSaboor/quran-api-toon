quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,80,"And God hath given you tents to dwell in: and He hath given you the skins of beasts for tents, that ye may find them light when ye shift your quarters, or when ye halt; and from their wool and soft fur and hair, hath He supplied you with furniture and goods for temporary use"
  16,81,"And from the things which He hath created, hath God provided shade for you, and hath given you the mountains for places of shelter, and hath given you garments to defend you from the heat, and garments to defend you in your wars. Thus doth He fill up the measure of His goodness towards you, that you may resign yourselves to Him"
  16,82,"But if they turn their backs, still thy office is only plain spoken preaching"
  16,83,They own the goodness of God - then they disown it - and most of them are infidels
  16,84,"But one day, we will raise up a witness out of every nation: them shall the infidels have no permission to make excuses, and they shall find no favour"
  16,85,"And when they who have acted thus wrongly shall behold their torment, it shall not be made light to them, nor will God deign to look upon them"
  16,86,"And when they who had joined associates with God shall see those their associate-gods, they shall say, \"O our Lord! these are our associate-gods whom we called upon beside Thee.\" But they shall retort on them, \"Verily, ye are liars"
  16,87,And on that day shall they proffer submission to God; and the deities of their own invention shall vanish from them
