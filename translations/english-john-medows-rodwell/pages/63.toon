quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,"But how can ye become infidels, when the signs of God are recited to you, and his prophet is among you? Whoever holdeth fast by God, is already guided to a straight path"
  3,102,O ye believers! fear God as He deserveth to be feared! and die not till ye have become Muslims
  3,103,"And hold ye fast by the cord of God, all of you, and break not loose from it; and remember God's goodness towards you, how that when ye were enemies, He united your hearts, and by his favour ye became brethren; And when ye were on the brink of the pit of fire, he drew you back from it. Thus God clearly sheweth you his signs that ye may be guided"
  3,104,"And that there may be among you a people who invite to the Good, and enjoin the Just, and forbid the Wrong. These are they with whom it shall be well"
  3,105,"And be ye not like those who have formed divisions, and fallen to variance after the clear proofs have come to them. These! a terrible chastisement doth await them"
  3,106,"On THE DAY when faces shall turn white, and faces shall turn black! And as to those whose faces shall have turned black \". . . .What! after your belief have ye become infidels? Taste then the chastisement, for that ye have been unbelievers"
  3,107,"And as to those whose faces shall have become white, they shall be within the mercy of God: therein shall they abide for ever"
  3,108,"These are the signs of God: we recite them to thee in truth: And God willeth not injustice to mankind"
