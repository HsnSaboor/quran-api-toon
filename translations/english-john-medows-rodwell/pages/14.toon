quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,89,"And when a Book had come to them from God, confirming that which they had received already - although they had before prayed for victory over those who believed not - yet when that Koran come to them, of which they had knowledge, they did not recognise it. The curse of God on the infidels"
  2,90,"For a vile price have they sold themselves, by not believing what God hath sent down, envious of God's sending down his grace on such of his servants as he pleaseth: and they have brought on themselves wrath upon wrath. And for the unbelievers is a disgraceful chastisement"
  2,91,"And when it is said to them, \"Believe in what God hath sent down,\" they say, \"In that which hath been sent down to us we believe:\" but what hath since been sent down they disbelieve, although it be the truth confirmatory of their own Scriptures. SAY: Why then have ye of old slain God's prophets, if ye are indeed believers"
  2,92,"Moreover, Moses came unto you with proofs of his mission. Then in his absence ye took the calf for your God, and did wickedly"
  2,93,"And when we accepted your covenant, and uplifted the mountain over you, we said, \"Take firm hold on what we have given you, and hearken.\" They said, \"We have hearkened and have rebelled:\" then were they made to drink down the calf into their hearts for their ingratitude. SAY: A bad thing hath your faith commanded you, if ye be indeed believers"
