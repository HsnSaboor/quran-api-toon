quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,135,"O ye who believe! stand fast to justice, when ye bear witness before God, though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kindred, whether the party be rich or poor. God is nearer than you to both. Therefore follow not passion, lest ye swerve from truth. And if ye wrest your testimony or stand aloof, God verily is well aware of what ye do"
  4,136,"O ye who believe! believe in God and his Apostle, and the Book which he hath sent down to his Apostle, and the Book which he hath sent down aforetime. Whoever believeth not on God and his Angels and his Books and his Apostles, and in the last day, he verily hath erred with far-gone error"
  4,137,"Verily, they who believed, then became unbelievers, then believed, and again became unbelievers, and then increased their unbelief - it is not God who will forgive them or guide them into the way"
  4,138,Announce to the hypocrites that a dolorous torment doth await them
  4,139,"Those who take the unbelievers for friends besides the faithful - do they seek honour at their hands? Verily, all honour belongeth unto God"
  4,140,"And already hath He sent this down to you in the Book \"WHEN YE SHALL HEAR THE SIGNS OF GOD THEY SHALL NOT BE BELIEVED BUT SHALL BE MOCKED AT.\" Sit ye not therefore with such, until they engage in other discourse; otherwise, ye will become like them. Verily God will gather the hypocrites and the infidels all together in Hell"
