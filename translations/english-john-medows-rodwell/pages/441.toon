  36,13,Set forth to them the instance of the people of the city when the Sent Ones came to it
  36,14,"When we sent two unto them and they charged them both with imposture - therefore with a third we strengthened them: and they said, \"Verily we are the Sent unto you of God"
  36,15,"They said, \"Ye are only men like us: Nought hath the God of Mercy sent down. Ye do nothing but lie"
  36,16,"They said, \"Our Lord knoweth that we are surely sent unto you"
  36,17,To proclaim a clear message is our only duty
  36,18,"They said, \"Of a truth we augur ill from you: if ye desist not we will surely stone you, and a grievous punishment will surely befall you from us"
  36,19,"They said, \"Your augury of ill is with yourselves. Will ye be warned? Nay, ye are an erring people"
  36,20,"Then from the end of the city a man came running: He said, \"O my people! follow the Sent Ones"
  36,21,"Follow those who ask not of you a recompense, and who are rightly guided"
  36,22,"And why should I not worship Him who made me, and to whom ye shall be brought back"
  36,23,"Shall I take gods beside Him? If the God of Mercy be pleased to afflict me, their intercession will not avert from me aught, nor will they deliver"
  36,24,Truly then should I be in a manifest error
  36,25,"Verily, in your Lord have I believed; therefore hear me"
  36,26,"It was said to him, \"Enter thou into Paradise:\" And he said, \"Oh that my people knew"
  36,27,"How gracious God hath been to me, and that He hath made me one of His honoured ones"
