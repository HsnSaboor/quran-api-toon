quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,270,"And whatever alms ye shall give, or whatever vow ye shall vow, of a truth God knoweth it: but they who act unjustly shall have no helpers"
  2,271,"Give ye your alms openly? it is well. Do ye conceal them and give them to the poor? This, too, will be of advantage to you, and will do away your sins: and God is cognisant of your actions"
  2,272,"Their guidance is not thine affair, O Muhammad; but God guideth whom he pleaseth. And the good that ye shall give in alms shall redound unto yourselves; and ye shall not give but as seeking the face of God; and whatever good thing ye shall have given in alms, shall be repaid you, and ye shall not be wronged"

Those who know them not, think them rich because of their modesty. By this their token thou shalt know them - they ask not of men with importunity: and of whatever good thing ye shall give them in alms, of a truth God will take knowledge"
  2,274,"They who give away their substance in alms, by night and day, in private and in public, shall have their reward with their Lord: no fear shall come on them, neither shall they be put to grief"
