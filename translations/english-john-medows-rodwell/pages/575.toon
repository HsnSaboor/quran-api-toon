quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Of a truth, thy Lord knoweth that thou prayest almost two-thirds, or half, or a third of the night, as do a part of thy followers. But God measureth the night and the day: He knoweth that ye cannot count its hours aright, and therefore, turneth to you mercifully. Recite then so much of the Koran as may be easy to you. He knoweth that there will be some among you sick, while others travel through the earth in quest of the bounties of God; and others do battle in his cause. Recite therefore so much of it as may be easy. And observe the Prayers and pay the legal Alms, and lend God a liberal loan: for whatever good works ye send on before for your own behoof, ye shall find with God. This will be best and richest in the recompense. And seek the forgiveness of God: verily, God is forgiving, Merciful"
  74,1,"O THOU, ENWRAPPED in thy mantle"
  74,2,Arise and warn
  74,3,Thy Lord - magnify Him
  74,4,Thy raiment - purify it
  74,5,The abomination - flee it
  74,6,And bestow not favours that thou mayest receive again with increase
  74,7,And for thy Lord wait thou patiently
  74,8,For when there shall be a trump on the trumpet
  74,9,That shall be a distressful day
  74,10,"A day, to the Infidels, devoid of ease"
  74,11,Leave me alone to deal with him whom I have created
  74,12,And on whom I have bestowed vast riches
  74,13,And sons dwelling before him
  74,14,And for whom I have smoothed all things smoothly down
  74,15,Yet desireth he that I should add more
  74,16,But no! because to our signs he is a foe
  74,17,I will lay grievous woes upon him
