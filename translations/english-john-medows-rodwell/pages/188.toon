quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,7,"How shall they who add gods to God be in league with God and with His Apostle, save those with whom ye made a league at the sacred temple? So long as they are true to you, be ye true to them; for God loveth those who fear Him"
  9,8,"How can they? since if they prevail against you, they will not regard in you either ties of blood or faith. With their mouths will they content you, but their hearts will be averse. The greater part of them are perverse doers"
  9,9,"They sell the signs of God for a mean price, and turn others aside from his way: evil is it that they do"
  9,10,They regard not in a believer either ties of blood or faith; these are the transgressors
  9,11,"Yet if they turn to God and observe prayer, and pay the impost, then are they your brethren in religion. We make clear our signs to those who understand"
  9,12,"But if, after alliance made, they break their oaths and revile your religion, then do battle with the ring-leaders of infidelity - for no oaths are binding with them that they may desist"
  9,13,"What! will ye not fight against those Meccans who have broken their oaths and aimed to expel your Apostle, and attacked you first? Will ye dread them? God is more worthy of your fear, if ye are believers"
