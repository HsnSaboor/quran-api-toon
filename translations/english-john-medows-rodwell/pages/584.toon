quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,When his Lord called to him in Towa's holy vale
  79,17,"Go to Pharaoh, for he hath burst all bounds"
  79,18,"And say, \"Wouldest thou become just"
  79,19,Then I will guide thee to thy Lord that thou mayest fear him
  79,20,And he showed him a great miracle
  79,21,"But he treated him as an impostor, and rebelled"
  79,22,Then turned he his back all hastily
  79,23,And gathered an assembly and proclaimed
  79,24,"And said, \"I am your Lord supreme"
  79,25,So God visited on him the punishment of this life and of the other
  79,26,"Verily, herein is a lesson for him who hath the fear of God"
  79,27,"Are ye the harder to create, or the heaven which he hath built"
  79,28,He reared its height and fashioned it
  79,29,"And gave darkness to its night, and brought out its light"
  79,30,And afterwards stretched forth the earth
  79,31,He brought forth from it its waters and its pastures
  79,32,And set the mountains firm
  79,33,For you and your cattle to enjoy
  79,34,But when the grand overthrow shall come
  79,35,The day when a man shall reflect on the pains that he hath taken
  79,36,And Hell shall be in full view of all who are looking on
  79,37,"Then, as for him who hath transgressed"
  79,38,And hath chosen this present life
  79,39,"Verily, Hell - that shall be his dwelling-place"
  79,40,"But as to him who shall have feared the majesty of his Lord, and shall have refrained his soul from lust"
  79,41,"Verily, Paradise - that shall be his dwelling-place"
  79,42,"They will ask thee of \"the Hour,\" when will be its fixed time"
  79,43,But what knowledge hast thou of it
  79,44,Its period is known only to thy Lord
  79,45,And thou art only charged with the warning of those who fear it
  79,46,"On the day when they shall see it, it shall seem to them as though they had not tarried in the tomb, longer than its evening or its morn"
