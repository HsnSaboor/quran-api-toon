quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,None shall be cast to it but the most wretched
  92,16,Who hath called the truth a lie and turned his back
  92,17,But the God-fearing shall escape it
  92,18,Who giveth away his substance that he may become pure
  92,19,And who offereth not favours to any one for the sake of recompense
  92,20,But only as seeking the face of his Lord the Most High
  92,21,And surely in the end he shall be well content
  93,1,BY the noon-day BRIGHTNESS
  93,2,And by the night when it darkeneth
  93,3,"Thy Lord hath not forsaken thee, neither hath he been displeased"
  93,4,And surely the Future shall be better for thee than the Past
  93,5,And in the end shall thy Lord be bounteous to thee and thou be satisfied
  93,6,Did he not find thee an orphan and gave thee a home
  93,7,And found thee erring and guided thee
  93,8,And found thee needy and enriched thee
  93,9,As to the orphan therefore wrong him not
  93,10,"And as to him that asketh of thee, chide him not away"
  93,11,And as for the favours of thy Lord tell them abroad
  94,1,HAVE we not OPENED thine heart for thee
  94,2,And taken off from thee thy burden
  94,3,Which galled thy back
  94,4,And have we not raised thy name for thee
  94,5,Then verily along with trouble cometh ease
  94,6,Verily along with trouble cometh ease
  94,7,"But when thou art set at liberty, then prosecute thy toil"
  94,8,And seek thy Lord with fervour
