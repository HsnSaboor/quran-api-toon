quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,"Those believers who sit at home free from trouble, and those who do valiantly in the cause of God with their substance and their persons, shall not be treated alike. God hath assigned to those who contend earnestly with their persons and with their substance, a rank above those who sit at home. Goodly promises hath He made to all. But God hath assigned to the strenuous a rich recompense, above those who sit still at home"
  4,96,"Rank of his own bestowal, and forgiveness, and mercy; for God is Indulgent, Merciful"
  4,97,"The angels, when they took the souls of those who had been unjust to their own weal, demanded, \"What hath been your state?\" They said, \"We were the weak ones of the earth.\" They replied, \"Was not God's earth broad enough for you to flee away in?\" These! their home shall be Hell, and evil the passage to it"
  4,98,"Except the men and women and children who were not able, through their weakness, to find the means of escape, and were not guided on their way"
  4,99,"These haply God will forgive: for God is Forgiving, Gracious"
  4,100,"Whoever flieth his country for the cause of God, will find in the earth many under like compulsion, and abundant resources; and if any one shall quit his home and fly to God and his apostle, and then death overtake him, - his reward from God is sure: for God is Gracious, Merciful"
  4,101,"And when ye go forth to war in the land, it shall be no crime in you to cut short your prayers, if ye fear lest the infidels come upon you; Verily, the infidels are your undoubted enemies"
