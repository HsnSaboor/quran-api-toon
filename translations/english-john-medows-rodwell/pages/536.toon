quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  56,51,"Then ye, O ye the erring, the gainsaying"
  56,52,Shall surely eat of the tree Ez-zakkoum
  56,53,And fill your bellies with it
  56,54,And thereupon shall ye drink boiling water
  56,55,And ye shall drink as the thirsty camel drinketh
  56,56,This shall be their repast in the day of reckoning
  56,57,"We created you, will ye not credit us"
  56,58,What think ye? The germs of life
  56,59,Is it ye who create them? or are we their creator
  56,60,It is we who have decreed that death should be among you
  56,61,"Yet are we not thereby hindered from replacing you with others, your likes, or from producing you again in a form which ye know not"
  56,62,"Ye have known the first creation: will ye not then reflect"
  56,63,What think ye? That which ye sow
  56,64,"Is it ye who cause its upgrowth, or do we cause it to spring forth"
  56,65,If we pleased we could so make your harvest dry and brittle that ye would ever marvel and say
  56,66,Truly we have been at cost
  56,67,yet are we forbidden harvest
  56,68,What think ye of the water ye drink
  56,69,"Is it ye who send it down from the clouds, or send we it down"
  56,70,"Brackish could we make it, if we pleased: will ye not then be thankful"
  56,71,What think ye? The fire which ye obtain by friction
  56,72,"Is it ye who rear its tree, or do we rear it"
  56,73,It is we who have made it for a memorial and a benefit to the wayfarers of the desert
  56,74,"Praise therefore the name of thy Lord, the Great"
  56,75,It needs not that I swear by the setting of the stars
  56,76,"And it is a great oath, if ye knew it"
