quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,I SWEAR by the declining day
  103,2,"Verily, man's lot is cast amid destruction"
  103,3,"Save those who believe and do the things which be right, and enjoin truth and enjoin stedfastness on each other"
  104,1,"Woe to every BACKBITER, Defamer"
  104,2,Who amasseth wealth and storeth it against the future
  104,3,He thinketh surely that his wealth shall be with him for ever
  104,4,Nay! for verily he shall be flung into the Crushing Fire
  104,5,And who shall teach thee what the Crushing Fire is
  104,6,It is God's kindled fire
  104,7,Which shall mount above the hearts of the damned
  104,8,It shall verily rise over them like a vault
  104,9,On outstretched columns
  105,1,HAST thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with the army of the ELEPHANT
  105,2,Did he not cause their stratagem to miscarry
  105,3,And he sent against them birds in flocks (ababils)
  105,4,Claystones did they hurl down upon them
  105,5,And he made them like stubble eaten down
