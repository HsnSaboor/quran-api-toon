quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What reason have ye for thus judging
  37,155,Will ye not then receive this warning
  37,156,Have ye a clear proof for them
  37,157,Produce your Book if ye speak truth
  37,158,"And they make him to be of kin with the Djinn: but the Djinn have long known that these idolaters shall be brought up before God"
  37,159,Far be the glory of God from what they impute to him
  37,160,His faithful servants do not thus
  37,161,"Moreover, ye and what ye worship"
  37,162,Shall not stir up any against God
  37,163,Save him who shall burn in Hell
  37,164,And verily each one of us hath his appointed place
  37,165,And we range ourselves in order
  37,166,And we celebrate His praises
  37,167,And if those infidels say
  37,168,Had we a revelation transmitted to us from those of old
  37,169,We had surely been God's faithful servants
  37,170,Yet they believe not the Koran. But they shall know its truth at last
  37,171,Our word came of old to our servants the apostles
  37,172,That they should surely be the succoured
  37,173,And that our armies should procure the victory for them
  37,174,Turn aside therefore from them for a time
  37,175,"And behold them, for they too shall in the end behold their doom"
  37,176,Would they then hasten our vengeance
  37,177,"But when it shall come down into their courts, an evil morning shall it be to those who have had their warning"
  37,178,Turn aside from them therefore for a time
  37,179,And behold; for they too shall in the end behold their doom
  37,180,"Far be the glory of thy Lord, the Lord of all greatness, from what they impute to him"
  37,181,And peace be on his Apostles
  37,182,And praise be to God the Lord of the worlds
