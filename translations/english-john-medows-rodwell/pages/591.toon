quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,"BY the heaven, and by the NIGHT-COMER"
  86,2,But who shall teach thee what the night-comer is
  86,3,Tis the star of piercing radiance
  86,4,Over every soul is set a guardian
  86,5,Let man then reflect out of what he was created
  86,6,He was created of the poured-forth germs
  86,7,Which issue from the loins and breastbones
  86,8,Well able then is God to restore him to life
  86,9,On the day when all secrets shall be searched out
  86,10,And he shall have no other might or helper
  86,11,I swear by the heaven which accomplisheth its cycle
  86,12,And by the earth which openeth her bosom
  86,13,That this Koran is a discriminating discourse
  86,14,And that it is not frivolous
  86,15,They plot a plot against thee
  86,16,And I will plot a plot against them
  86,17,Deal calmly therefore with the infidels; leave them awhile alone
  87,1,PRAISE the name of thy Lord THE MOST HIGH
  87,2,Who hath created and balanced all things
  87,3,Who hath fixed their destinies and guideth them
  87,4,Who bringeth forth the pasture
  87,5,And reduceth it to dusky stubble
  87,6,"We will teach thee to recite the Koran, nor aught shalt thou forget"
  87,7,Save what God pleaseth; for he knoweth alike things manifest and hidden
  87,8,And we will make easy to thee our easy ways
  87,9,"Warn, therefore, for the warning is profitable"
  87,10,He that feareth God will receive the warning
  87,11,And the most reprobate only will turn aside from it
  87,12,Who shall be exposed to the terrible fire
  87,13,"In which he shall not die, and shall not live"
  87,14,Happy he who is purified by Islam
  87,15,And who remembereth the name of his Lord and prayeth
