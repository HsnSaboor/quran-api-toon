quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,And intercession of the interceders shall not avail them
  74,49,Then what hath come to them that they turn aside from the Warning
  74,50,As if they were affrighted asses
  74,51,fleeing from a lion
  74,52,And every one of them would fain have open pages given to him out of Heaven
  74,53,It shall not be. They fear not the life to come
  74,54,It shall not be. For this Koran is warning enough
  74,55,"And whoso will, it warneth him"
  74,56,"But not unless God please, shall they be warned. Meet is He to be feared. Meet is forgiveness in Him"
  75,1,It needeth not that I swear by the day of the RESURRECTION
  75,2,Or that I swear by the self-accusing soul
  75,3,Thinketh man that we shall not re-unite his bones
  75,4,Aye! his very finger tips are we able evenly to replace
  75,5,But man chooseth to deny what is before him
  75,6,"He asketh, \"When this day of Resurrection"
  75,7,But when the eye shall be dazzled
  75,8,And when the moon shall be darkened
  75,9,And the sun and the moon shall be together
  75,10,"On that day man shall cry, \"Where is there a place to flee to"
  75,11,But in vain - there is no refuge
  75,12,With thy Lord on that day shall be the sole asylum
  75,13,On that day shall man be told of all that he hath done first and last
  75,14,"Yea, a man shall be the eye witness against himself"
  75,15,And even if he put forth his plea
  75,16,Move not thy tongue in haste to follow and master this revelation
  75,17,For we will see to the collecting and the recital of it
  75,18,"But when we have recited it, then follow thou the recital"
  75,19,"And, verily, afterwards it shall be ours to make it clear to thee"
