quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,HAPPY now the BELIEVERS
  23,2,Who humble them in their prayer
  23,3,And who keep aloof from vain words
  23,4,And who are doers of alms deeds
  23,5,And who restrain their appetites
  23,6,"Save with their wives, or the slaves whom their right hands possess: for in that case they shall be free from blame"
  23,7,But they whose desires reach further than this are transgressors
  23,8,And who tend well their trusts and their covenants
  23,9,And who keep them strictly to their prayers
  23,10,These shall be the heritors
  23,11,"Who shall inherit the paradise, to abide therein for ever"
  23,12,Now of fine clay have we created man
  23,13,"Then we placed him, a moist germ, in a safe abode"
  23,14,"Then made we the moist germ a clot of blood: then made the clotted blood into a piece of flesh; then made the piece of flesh into bones: and we clothed the bones with flesh: then brought forth man of yet another make - Blessed therefore be God, the most excellent of Makers"
  23,15,Then after this ye shall surely die
  23,16,Then shall ye be waked up on the day of resurrection
  23,17,"And we have created over you seven heavens: - and we are not careless of the creation"
