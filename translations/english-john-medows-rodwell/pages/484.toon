quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  42,11,"Creator of the Heavens and of the Earth! he hath given you wives from among your own selves, and cattle male and female - by this means to multiply you: Nought is there like Him! the Hearer, the Beholder He"
  42,12,"His, the keys of the Heavens and of the Earth! He giveth with open hand, or sparingly, to whom He will: He knoweth all things"
  42,13,"To you hath He prescribed the faith which He commanded unto Noah, and which we have revealed to thee, and which we commanded unto Abraham and Moses and Jesus, saying, \"Observe this faith, and be not divided into sects therein.\" Intolerable to those who worship idols jointly with God Is that faith to which thou dost call them. Whom He pleaseth will God choose for it, and whosoever shall turn to Him in penitence will He guide to it"
  42,14,"Nor were they divided into sects through mutual jealousy, till after that \"the knowledge\" had come to them: and had not a decree from thy Lord gone forth respiting them to a fixed time, verily, there had at once been a decision between them. And they who have inherited \"the Book\" after them, are in perplexity of doubt concerning it"
  42,15,"For this cause summon thou them to the faith, and go straight on as thou hast been bidden, and follow not their desires: and SAY: In whatsoever Books God hath sent down do I believe: I am commanded to decide justly between you: God is your Lord and our Lord: we have our works and you have your works: between us and you let there be no strife: God will make us all one: and to Him shall we return"
