  72,1,"SAY: It hath been revealed to me that a company of DJINN listened, and said, - \"Verily, we have heard a marvellous discourse (Koran)"
  72,2,"It guideth to the truth; wherefore we believed in it, and we will not henceforth join any being with our Lord"
  72,3,"And He, - may the majesty of our Lord be exalted! - hath taken no spouse neither hath he any offspring"
  72,4,But the foolish among us hath spoken of God that which is unjust
  72,5,And we verily thought that no one amongst men or Djinn would have uttered a lie against God
  72,6,"There are indeed people among men, who have sought for refuge unto people among Djinn: but they only increased their folly"
  72,7,"And they thought, as ye think, that God would not raise any from the dead"
  72,8,"And the Heavens did we essay, but found them filled with a mighty garrison, and with flaming darts"
  72,9,"And we sat on some of the seats to listen, but whoever listeneth findeth an ambush ready for him of flaming darts"
  72,10,"And truly we know not whether evil be meant for them that are on earth, or whether their Lord meaneth guidance for them"
  72,11,"And there are among us good, and others among us of another kind; - we are of various sorts"
  72,12,"And verily we thought that no one could weaken God on earth, neither could we escape from him by flight"
  72,13,"Wherefore as soon as we had heard 'the guidance' we believed in it; and whoever believeth in his Lord, need not fear either loss or wrong"
