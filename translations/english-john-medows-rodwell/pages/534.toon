  56,1,WHEN the day that must come shall have come suddenly
  56,2,None shall treat that sudden coming as a lie
  56,3,Day that shall abase! Day that shall exalt
  56,4,When the earth shall be shaken with a shock
  56,5,And the mountains shall be crumbled with a crumbling
  56,6,And shall become scattered dust
  56,7,And into three bands shall ye be divided
  56,8,Then the people of the right hand - Oh! how happy shall be the people of the right hand
  56,9,And the people of the left hand - Oh! how wretched shall be the people of the left hand
  56,10,And they who were foremost on earth - the foremost still
  56,11,These are they who shall be brought nigh to God
  56,12,In gardens of delight
  56,13,A crowd of the former
  56,14,And few of the latter generations
  56,15,On inwrought couches
  56,16,Reclining on them face to face
