quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,BY the SUN and his noonday brightness
  91,2,By the Moon when she followeth him
  91,3,By the Day when it revealeth his glory
  91,4,By the Night when it enshroudeth him
  91,5,By the Heaven and Him who built it
  91,6,By the Earth and Him who spread it forth
  91,7,By a Soul and Him who balanced it
  91,8,And breathed into it its wickedness and its piety
  91,9,Blessed now is he who hath kept it pure
  91,10,And undone is he who hath corrupted it
  91,11,Themoud in his impiety rejected the message of the Lord
  91,12,When the greatest wretch among them rushed up
  91,13,"Said the Apostle of God to them, - \"The Camel of God! let her drink"
  91,14,"But they treated him as an impostor and hamstrung her. So their Lord destroyed them for their crime, and visited all alike"
  91,15,Nor feared he the issue
  92,1,BY the NIGHT when she spreads her veil
  92,2,By the Day when it brightly shineth
  92,3,By Him who made male and female
  92,4,At different ends truly do ye aim
  92,5,But as to him who giveth alms and feareth God
  92,6,And yieldeth assent to the Good
  92,7,To him will we make easy the path to happiness
  92,8,But as to him who is covetous and bent on riches
  92,9,And calleth the Good a lie
  92,10,To him will we make easy the path to misery
  92,11,And what shall his wealth avail him when he goeth down
  92,12,Truly man's guidance is with Us
  92,13,"And Our's, the Future and the Past"
  92,14,I warn you therefore of the flaming fire
