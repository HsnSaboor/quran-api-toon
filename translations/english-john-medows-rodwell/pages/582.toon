quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,Of what ask they of one another
  78,2,Of the great NEWS
  78,3,The theme of their disputes
  78,4,Nay! they shall certainly knows its truth
  78,5,Again. Nay! they shall certainly know it
  78,6,Have we not made the Earth a couch
  78,7,And the mountains its tent-stakes
  78,8,We have created you of two sexes
  78,9,And ordained your sleep for rest
  78,10,And ordained the night as a mantle
  78,11,And ordained the day for gaining livelihood
  78,12,And built above you seven solid heavens
  78,13,And placed therein a burning lamp
  78,14,And we send down water in abundance from the rain-clouds
  78,15,That we may bring forth by it corn and herbs
  78,16,And gardens thick with trees
  78,17,Lo! the day of Severance is fixed
  78,18,"The day when there shall be a blast on the trumpet, and ye shall come in crowds"
  78,19,And the heaven shall be opened and be full of portals
  78,20,"And the mountains shall be set in motion, and melt into thin vapour"
  78,21,Hell truly shall be a place of snares
  78,22,The home of transgressors
  78,23,To abide therein ages
  78,24,No coolness shall they taste therein nor any drink
  78,25,Save boiling water and running sores
  78,26,Meet recompense
  78,27,For they looked not forward to their account
  78,28,"And they gave the lie to our signs, charging them with falsehood"
  78,29,But we noted and wrote down all
  78,30,"Taste this then: and we will give you increase of nought but torment"
