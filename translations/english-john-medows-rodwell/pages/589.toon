quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,As reclining on bridal couches they behold them
  83,36,Shall not the infidels be recompensed according to their works
  84,1,WHEN the Heaven shall have SPLIT ASUNDER
  84,2,And duteously obeyed its Lord
  84,3,And when Earth shall have been stretched out as a plain
  84,4,And shall have cast forth what was in her and become empty
  84,5,And duteously obeyed its Lord
  84,6,"Then verily, O man, who desirest to reach thy Lord, shalt thou meet him"
  84,7,And he into whose right hand his Book shall be given
  84,8,Shall be reckoned with in an easy reckoning
  84,9,"And shall turn, rejoicing, to his kindred"
  84,10,But he whose Book shall be given him behind his back
  84,11,Shall invoke destruction
  84,12,But in the fire shall he burn
  84,13,For that he lived joyously among his kindred
  84,14,Without a thought that he should return to God
  84,15,"Yea, but his Lord beheld him"
  84,16,It needs not therefore that I swear by the sunset redness
  84,17,And by the night and its gatherings
  84,18,And by the moon when at her full
  84,19,That from state to state shall ye be surely carried onward
  84,20,What then hath come to them that they believe not
  84,21,And that when the Koran is recited to them they adore not
  84,22,"Yea, the unbelievers treat it as a lie"
  84,23,But God knoweth their secret hatreds
  84,24,Let their only tidings be those of painful punishment
  84,25,Save to those who believe and do the things that be right. An unfailing recompense shall be theirs
