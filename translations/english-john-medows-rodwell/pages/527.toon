quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,"Verily, it is they who believe not in the life to come, who name the angels with names of females"
  53,28,"But herein they have no knowledge: they follow a mere conceit; and mere conceit can never take the place of truth"
  53,29,Withdraw then from him who turneth his back on our warning and desireth only this present life
  53,30,"This is the sum of their knowledge. Truly thy Lord best knoweth him who erreth from his way, and He best knoweth him who hath received guidance"
  53,31,"And whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth is God's that he may reward those who do evil according to their deeds: and those who do good will He reward with good things"
  53,32,"To those who avoid great crimes and scandals but commit only lighter faults, verily, thy Lord will be diffuse of mercy. He well knew you when he produced you out of the earth, and when ye were embryos in your mother's womb. Assert not then your own purity. He best knoweth who feareth him"
  53,33,Hast thou considered him who turned his back
  53,34,Who giveth little and is covetous
  53,35,Is it that he hath the knowledge and vision of the secret things
  53,36,Hath he not been told of what is in the pages of Moses
  53,37,And of Abraham faithful to his pledge
  53,38,That no burdened soul shall bear the burdens of another
  53,39,And that nothing shall be reckoned to a man but that for which he hath made efforts
  53,40,And that his efforts shall at last be seen in their true light
  53,41,That then he shall be recompensed with a most exact recompense
  53,42,And that unto thy Lord is the term of all things
  53,43,And that it is He who causeth to laugh and to weep
  53,44,And that He causeth to die and maketh alive
