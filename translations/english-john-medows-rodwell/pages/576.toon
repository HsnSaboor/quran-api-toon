quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,For he plotted and he planned
  74,19,May he be cursed! How he planned
  74,20,"Again, may he be cursed! How he planned"
  74,21,Then looked he around him
  74,22,Then frowned and scowled
  74,23,Then turned his back and swelled with disdain
  74,24,"And said, \"This is merely magic that will be wrought"
  74,25,It is merely the word of a mortal
  74,26,We will surely cast him into Hell-fire
  74,27,And who shall teach thee what Hell-fire is
  74,28,"It leaveth nought, it spareth nought"
  74,29,Blackening the skin
  74,30,Over it are nineteen angels
  74,31,"None but angels have we made guardians of the fire: nor have we made this to be their number but to perplex the unbelievers, and that they who possess the Scriptures may be certain of the truth of the Koran, and that they who believe may increase their faith; And that they to whom the Scriptures have been given, and the believers, may not doubt; And that the infirm of heart and the unbelievers may say, What meaneth God by this parable? Thus God misleadeth whom He will, and whom He will doth He guide aright: and none knoweth the armies of thy Lord but Himself: and this is no other than a warning to mankind"
  74,32,"Nay, by the Moon"
  74,33,By the Night when it retreateth
  74,34,By the Morn when it brighteneth
  74,35,Hell is one of the most grievous woes
  74,36,Fraught with warning to man
  74,37,"To him among you who desireth to press forward, or to remain behind"
  74,38,For its own works lieth every soul in pledge
  74,39,But they of God's right hand
  74,40,In their gardens
  74,41,shall ask of the wicked
  74,42,What hath cast you into Hell-fire
  74,43,"They will say, \"We were not of those who prayed"
  74,44,And we were not of those who fed the poor
  74,45,And we plunged into vain disputes with vain disputers
  74,46,"And we rejected as a lie, the day of reckoning"
  74,47,Till the certainty came upon us
