quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,71,O people of the Book! why clothe ye the truth with falsehood? Why wittingly hide the truth
  3,72,"Others of the people of the Book say: \"Believe in what hath been sent down to the believers, at daybreak, and deny it at its close\" - Thus do they go back"
  3,73,"And believe in those only who follow your Religion.\" SAY: True guidance is guidance from God - that to others may be imparted the like of what hath been imparted to you. Will they wrangle then with you in the presence of their Lord? SAY: Plenteous gifts are in the hands of God: He imparteth them unto whom He will, and God is Bounteous, Wise"
  3,74,"He will vouchsafe His mercy to whom He will, for God is of great bounteousness"
  3,75,"Among the people of the Book are some, to one of whom if thou entrust a thousand dinars, he will restore them to thee: And there is of them to whom if thou entrust a dinar, he will not restore it to thee, unless thou be ever instant with him. This - because they say, \"We are not bound to keep faith with the ignorant (Pagan) folk, and they utter a lie against God, and know they do so"
  3,76,"But whoso is true to his engagement, and feareth God, - verily God loveth those that fear Him"
  3,77,"Verily they who barter their engagement with God, and their oaths, for some paltry price - These! no portion for them in the world to come! and God will not speak to them, and will not look on them, on the day of resurrection, and will not assoil them! for them, a grievous chastisement"
