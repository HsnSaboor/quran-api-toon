quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"The believers say, \"Oh, would that a Sura were sent down!\" but when a peremptory Sura is revealed, whose burden is war, thou mayest see the diseased of heart look toward thee, with a look of one on whom the shadows of death have fallen! But better in them would be obedience and becoming language"
  47,21,"And if, when the command for war is issued, they are true to God, it will be assuredly best for them"
  47,22,"Were ye not ready, if ye had turned back from Him, to spread disorder in the land, and violate the ties of blood"
  47,23,"These are they whom God hath cursed, and made deaf, and blinded their eyes"
  47,24,Will they not then meditate on the Koran? Are locks upon their hearts
  47,25,"But as to those who return to their errors after \"the guidance\" hath been made plain to them, Satan shall beguile them, and fill them with his suggestions"
  47,26,"This - because they say to those who abhor what God hath sent down, \"We will comply with you in part of what ye enjoin.\" But God knoweth their secret reservations"
  47,27,"But how? When the angels, in causing them to die, shall smite them on the face and back"
  47,28,"This - because they follow that which angereth God, and abhor what pleaseth Him: therefore will He make their works fruitless"
  47,29,"Think these men of diseased hearts, that God will not bring out their malice to light"
