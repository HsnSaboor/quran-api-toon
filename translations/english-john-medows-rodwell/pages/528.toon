quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,"And that He hath created the sexes, male and female"
  53,46,From the diffused germs of life
  53,47,And that with Him is the second creation
  53,48,And that He enricheth and causeth to possess
  53,49,And that He is the Lord of Sirius
  53,50,And that it was He who destroyed the ancient Adites
  53,51,And the people of Themoud and left not one survivor
  53,52,And before them the people of Noah who were most wicked and most perverse
  53,53,And it was He who destroyed the cities that were overthrown
  53,54,So that that which covered them covered them
  53,55,Which then of thy Lord's benefits wilt thou make a matter of doubt
  53,56,He who warneth you is one of the warners of old
  53,57,"The day that must draw nigh, draweth nigh already"
  53,58,and yet none but God can reveal its time
  53,59,Is it at these sayings that ye marvel
  53,60,And that ye laugh and weep not
  53,61,And that ye are triflers
  53,62,Prostrate yourselves then to God and worship
  54,1,The hour hath approached and the MOON hath been cleft
  54,2,"But whenever they see a miracle they turn aside and say, This is well-devised magic"
  54,3,"And they have treated the prophets as impostors, and follow their own lusts; but everything is unalterably fixed"
  54,4,A message of prohibition had come to them
  54,5,Consummate wisdom - but warners profit them not
  54,6,Quit them then. On the day when the summoner shall summon to a stern business
