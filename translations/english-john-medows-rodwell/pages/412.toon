quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  31,12,"Of old we bestowed wisdom upon LOKMAN, and taught him thus - \"Be thankful to God: for whoever is thankful, is thankful to his own behoof; and if any shall be thankless . . . God truly is self-sufficient, worthy of all praise"
  31,13,"And bear in mind when Lokman said to his son by way of warning, \"O my son! join not other gods with God, for the joining gods with God is the great impiety"
  31,14,"We have commanded man concerning his parents. His mother carrieth him with weakness upon weakness; nor until after two years is he weaned. Be grateful to me, and to thy parents. Unto me shall all come"
  31,15,"But if they importune thee to join that with Me of which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not: comport thyself towards them in this world as is meet and right; but follow the way of him who turneth unto me. Unto me shall ye return at last, and then will I tell you of your doings"
  31,16,"O my son! verily God will bring everything to light, though it were but the weight of a grain of mustard-seed, and hidden in a rock or in the heavens or in the earth; for, God is subtile, informed of all"
  31,17,"O my son! observe prayer, and enjoin the right and forbid the wrong, and be patient under whatever shall betide thee: for this is a bounden duty"
  31,18,And distort not thy face at men; nor walk thou loftily on the earth; for God loveth no arrogant vain-glorious one
  31,19,"But let thy pace be middling; and lower thy voice: for the least pleasing of voices is surely the voice of asses"
