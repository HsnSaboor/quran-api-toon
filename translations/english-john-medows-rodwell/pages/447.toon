quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,25,"How now, that ye help not one another"
  37,26,But on this day they shall submit themselves to God
  37,27,And shall address one another with mutual reproaches
  37,28,"They shall say, \"In sooth, ye came to us in well-omened sort"
  37,29,"But they will answer, \"Nay, it was ye who would not believe"
  37,30,"and we had no power whatever over you. Nay, ye were people given to transgress"
  37,31,"Just, therefore, is the doom which our Lord hath passed upon us. We shall surely taste it"
  37,32,"We made you err, for we had erred ourselves"
  37,33,Partners therefore shall they be in punishment on that day
  37,34,"Truly, thus will we deal with the wicked"
  37,35,"Because when it was said to them, There is no God but God, they swelled with pride"
  37,36,"And said, \"Shall we then abandon our gods for a crazed poet"
  37,37,"Nay, he cometh with truth and confirmeth the Sent Ones of old"
  37,38,Ye shall surely taste the painful punishment
  37,39,And ye shall not be rewarded but as ye have wrought
  37,40,Save the sincere servants of God
  37,41,A stated banquet shall they have
  37,42,Of fruits; and honoured shall they be
  37,43,In the gardens of delight
  37,44,Upon couches face to face
  37,45,A cup shall be borne round among them from a fountain
  37,46,"Limpid, delicious to those who drink"
  37,47,"It shall not oppress the sense, nor shall they therewith be drunken"
  37,48,And with them are the large-eyed ones with modest refraining glances
  37,49,fair like the sheltered egg
  37,50,And they shall address one another with mutual questions
  37,51,"Saith one of them, \"I truly had a bosom friend"
