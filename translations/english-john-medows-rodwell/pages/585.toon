quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,"HE FROWNED, and he turned his back"
  80,2,Because the blind man came to him
  80,3,But what assured thee that he would not be cleansed by the Faith
  80,4,"Or be warned, and the warning profit him"
  80,5,As to him who is wealthy
  80,6,To him thou wast all attention
  80,7,Yet is it not thy concern if he be not cleansed
  80,8,But as to him who cometh to thee in earnest
  80,9,And full of fears
  80,10,Him dost thou neglect
  80,11,Nay! but it (the Koran) is a warning
  80,12,And whoso is willing beareth it in mind
  80,13,Written on honoured pages
  80,14,"Exalted, purified"
  80,15,"By the hands of Scribes, honoured, righteous"
  80,16,Cursed be man! What hath made him unbelieving
  80,17,Of what thing did God create him
  80,18,Out of moist germs
  80,19,He created him and fashioned him
  80,20,Then made him an easy passage from the womb
  80,21,Then causeth him to die and burieth him
  80,22,"Then, when he pleaseth, will raise him again to life"
  80,23,Aye! but man hath not yet fulfilled the bidding of his Lord
  80,24,Let man look at his food
  80,25,It was We who rained down the copious rains
  80,26,Then cleft the earth with clefts
  80,27,And caused the upgrowth of the grain
  80,28,And grapes and healing herbs
  80,29,And the olive and the palm
  80,30,And enclosed gardens thick with trees
  80,31,And fruits and herbage
  80,32,For the service of yourselves and of your cattle
  80,33,But when the stunning trumpet-blast shall arrive
  80,34,On that day shall a man fly from his brother
  80,35,And his mother and his father
  80,36,And his wife and his children
  80,37,For every man of them on that day his own concerns shall be enough
  80,38,There shall be faces on that day radiant
  80,39,Laughing and joyous
  80,40,And faces on that day with dust upon them
  80,41,Blackness shall cover them
  80,42,"These are the Infidels, the Impure"
