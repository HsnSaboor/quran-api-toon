quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,Aye-blooming youths go round about to them
  56,18,With goblets and ewers and a cup of flowing wine
  56,19,"Their brows ache not from it, nor fails the sense"
  56,20,And with such fruits as shall please them best
  56,21,"And with flesh of such birds, as they shall long for"
  56,22,"And theirs shall be the Houris, with large dark eyes"
  56,23,like pearls hidden in their shells
  56,24,In recompense of their labours past
  56,25,"No vain discourse shall they hear therein, nor charge of sin"
  56,26,"But only the cry, \"Peace! Peace"
  56,27,And the people of the right hand - oh! how happy shall be the people of the right hand
  56,28,Amid thornless sidrahs
  56,29,And tall trees clad with fruit
  56,30,And in extended shade
  56,31,And by flowing waters
  56,32,And with abundant fruits
  56,33,"Unfailing, unforbidden"
  56,34,And on lofty couches
  56,35,Of a rare creation have we created the Houris
  56,36,And we have made them ever virgins
  56,37,"Dear to their spouses, of equal age with them"
  56,38,For the people of the right hand
  56,39,A crowd of the former
  56,40,And a crowd of the latter generations
  56,41,But the people of the left hand - oh! how wretched shall be the people of the left hand
  56,42,Amid pestilential winds and in scalding water
  56,43,And in the shadow of a black smoke
  56,44,"Not cool, and horrid to behold"
  56,45,"For they truly, ere this, were blessed with worldly goods"
  56,46,But persisted in heinous sin
  56,47,"And were wont to say, \"What! after we have died, and become dust and bones, shall we be raised"
  56,48,"And our fathers, the men of yore"
  56,49,"SAY: Aye, the former and the latter"
  56,50,Gathered shall they all be for the time of a known day
