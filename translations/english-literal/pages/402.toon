  29,46,"And do not argue/dispute with The Book`s people except with which it is best , except those who were unjust/oppressive from them, and say: \"We believed with what was descended on (to) us, and was descended to you, and our God, and your God (is) one, and we are to Him Moslems/submitters"
  29,47,"And like that, We descended to you The Book , so those who We gave/brought them The Book , they believe by (in) it, and from those who believes by (in) it, and none disbelieves and denies with Our verses/evidences except the disbelievers"
  29,48,"And We were not reading/reciting from before it from a Book , and nor you write it with your right (hand), then the wasters/falsifiers would have doubted/become suspicious"
  29,49,"But it is verses/evidences evidences in those who were given/brought the knowledge`s chests (innermosts), and none disbelieves and denies with Our verses/evidences except the unjust/oppressive"
  29,50,"And they said: \"If only verses/evidences/signs were descended on (to) him from his Lord.\" Say: \"But/truly the verses/evidence/signs (are) at God, and but/truly I am a clear/evident warner/giver of notice"
  29,51,"Was (it) not enough/sufficient for them that We descended on (to) you The Book (it) is being read/recited on (to) them, that in that (is) mercy (E) and a remembrance/reminder to a nation believing"
  29,52,"Say: \"Enough/sufficient by God between me and between you (as) a witness/testifier , He knows what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and those who believed by (in) the falsehood, and disbelieved by (in) God, those, they are the losers"
