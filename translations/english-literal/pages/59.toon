  3,71,"You The Book`s people, why do you confuse/mix/cover/dress the correct/truth with the falsehood and you hide/conceal the correct/truth and you are knowing"
  3,72,"And a group from The Book`s people, said: \"Believe with (what) was/is descended on those who believed (during the) face/front (beginning of) the daytime and disbelieve (during) its end, maybe they return"
  3,73,"And do not believe except to whom followed your religion, say: \"That the guidance (is) God`s guidance.\" That one be given equal/alike (to) what you were given or they argue/quarrel with you at your Lord. Say: \"That the grace/favour (is) with God`s hand, He gives it (to) whom He wills/wants, and God (is) spacious ,knowledgeable"

  3,75,"And from The Book`s people, whom if you entrust him with a (ton) , he discharges/fulfills (pays) it (back) to you, and from them whom, if you entrust him with a dinar , (he) does not discharge/fulfill (pay) it (back) to you, except as long as you continued keeping up (demanding) on him. That is with that they said: \"It is not on us in the illiterates/belongers to a nation (a) means (we do not have to be honest when dealing with other nations).\" And they say on God the lie/falsehood and they know"
