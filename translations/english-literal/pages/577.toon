quran[28]{c,v,t}:

  74,50,As if they are frightened/running away donkeys
  74,51,It escaped/fled from cruelty/a lion
  74,52,But every/each human from them wants/intends that he be given/brought written sheets/pages (books/scriptures) spread/publicized
  74,53,No but they do not fear the end (other life)
  74,54,"No, but that it (the Koran) truly is a reminder"
  74,55,So who wanted/intended remembered it
  74,56,"And they do not mention/remember except that God wills/wants , He is worthy/relation (owner of) the fear and obedience, and (He is) worthy/relation (owner of) the forgiveness"
  75,1,I do not swear/make oath with the Resurrection Day
  75,2,"And nor I swear/make oath with the self , the often blaming/reprimanding"
  75,3,Does the human/mankind think/suppose that We (will) not gather/unite his bones
  75,4,Yes/certainly We are capable/able on that (E) We straighten (recreate) his fingertip (finger print)

  75,12,To your Lord that day (is) the settlement
  75,13,The human/mankind (will) be informed that day with what he advanced/preceded and he delayed
  75,14,Rather the human/mankind (is) on him self (an) evidence/witness
  75,15,And even if he threw (gave) his apologies/excuses
  75,16,Do not move with it your tongue to hurry/hasten/rush with it
  75,17,"That truly on Us (is) gathering/accumulating it , and its reading/recitation"
