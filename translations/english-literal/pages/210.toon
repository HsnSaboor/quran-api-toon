  10,16,"Say: \" If God wanted/willed I would not (have) read/recited it on you, and He would not (have) informed you with (of) it, so I had stayed/remained in (between) you a life time from before it, so do you not reason/understand"

  10,18,"And they worship from other than God what does not harm them and nor benefit them, and they say: \"Those (are) our mediators at God.\" Say: \"Do you inform God with what He does not know in the skies/space and nor in the earth/Planet Earth?\" His praise/glory and high, mighty, exalted and dignified from what they share/make partners (with God)"
  10,19,"And the people were not except one nation , so they differed/disagreed/disputed, and where it not for a word preceded from your Lord, (it) would have executed/ended (E) between them, in what they are in it differing/disagreeing"
  10,20,"And they say: \"If only an evidence/sign was descended on him from his Lord.\" So say: \"But the absent/supernatural (is) to God so wait , that I am with you from the waiting"
