quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,84,"And when We took your promise/covenant. \"Do not shed your blood and do not bring yourselves out from your homes/countries , then you acknowledged/accepted and you (are) witnessing/testifying"
  2,85,"Then you are those who you kill yourselves and you force out a group/part from you, from their homes/countries, you cooperate/support on (against) them with the sin/crime and the transgression/injustice/aggression and if they come to you captives/prisoners you ransom them , and it is forbidden on you bringing/forcing them out. Do you believe with some/part (of) The Book and you disbelieve with some/part? So but (what is the) reward/reimbursement (of) who does that from you, except shame/scandal/disgrace in the life the present/worldly life (on) and the Resurrection Day they be returned to the torture`s strongest (severest), and God (is) not with ignoring/disregarding on what you make/do"
  2,86,"Those are these who bought/volunteered the life the present/worldly life with the end (other life), so the torture is not to be lightened/reduced on them, and nor they be given victory"
  2,87,"And We had given/brought Moses The Book and We sent from after him with the messengers, and Wegave/brought Jesus Mary`s son, the evidences and We supported him with the Holy/Sanctimonious Soul/Spirit , so if whenever a messenger came to you with what yourselves do not desire you become arrogant, so a group you denied and a group you kill"
  2,88,"And they said: \"Our hearts/minds (are) covered/uncomprehending .\" But God cursed them with their disbelief, so little/few (are) what they believe"
