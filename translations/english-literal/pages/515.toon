  48,29,"Mohammad (is) God`s messenger, and those who with him (are) strong over the disbelievers, merciful between them, you see them bowing, prostrating wishing/desiring grace/favour from God, and an acceptance/approval , their marks/identifications/expressions (are) in their faces/fronts from the prostration`s trace/sign , that (is) their example in the Torah, and their example in the Bible/New Testament , as/like a plant/crop, it brought out/emerged its sprout/shoot , so it surrounded and strengthened it, so it hardened/thickened , so it straightened/leveled on its stem, it pleases/marvels the sowers/seeders/planters to anger/enrage with it the disbelievers, God promised those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds from them, forgiveness and a great reward"
  49,1,"You, you those who believed, do not precede/advance between God`s hands and His messenger, and fear and obey God, that truly God (is) hearing/listening, knowledgeable"
  49,2,"You, you those who believed, do not raise your voices above the prophet`s voice , and do not publicize/declare (address openly) to him with the declaration/statement as/like publicizing/declaring/loudness some of you to some (to each other), that (E) your deeds waste/invalidate , and you do not know/sense/feel"
