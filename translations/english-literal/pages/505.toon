  46,22,"They said: \"Did you come to us to turn us away from our gods, so come/bring to us with what you promise us if you were from the truthful"
  46,23,"He said: \"But/truly the knowledge (is) at God, and I communicate/inform you what I was sent with it, and but I see you (as) a nation being lowly/ignorant"
  46,24,"So when they saw/understood it an obstructing cloud approaching/coming (to) their valleys, they said: \"That obstructing cloud (is) raining on us.\" No/rather it is what you hurried/hastened with it, a wind/smell in it (is) a painful torture"
  46,25,"It destroys every thing with its Lord`s order/command, so they became/became in the morning not (to) be seen except their residences, as/like that We reimburse the nation, the criminals/sinners"
  46,26,"And We had (E) highly positioned/strengthened them in what We have not highly positioned/strengthened you in it, and We made/put for them a sense of hearing , and eye sights, and hearts , so their sense of hearing , and nor their eye sights, and nor their hearts did not enrich/suffice from them a thing when they were disbelieving and denying with God`s evidences/verses ; and what they were with it mocking/making fun of surrounded/encircled with them"
