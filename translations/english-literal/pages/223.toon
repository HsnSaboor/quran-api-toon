  11,13,"Or they say: \"He fabricated/cut and split it.\" Say: \"So come or bring with ten chapters of the Koran similar/equal/alike to it fabricated , and call whom you were able from other than God if you were truthful"
  11,14,"So if they do not answer/reply to you, so know that (the Koran) was/is descended with God`s knowledge , that (there is) no God except Him, so are you submitters/surrenderers/Moslems"
  11,15,"Who was/is wanting the life the present/worldly life and its decoration/beauty/ornament, We fulfill/complete to them their deeds in it, and they in it are not being reduced/cheated/caused injustice to"
  11,16,"Those are those not (nothing is) for them in the end (other life) except the fire , and what they made/did (was) wasted/invalidated in it, and is being wasted/annulled/canceled what they were making/doing"
  11,17,"Is who was on an evidence from his Lord, and he reads/recites/follows it a witness/testifier from Him, and from before him/it Moses` Book a leader/clear road/an example and a mercy? Those believe with it, and who disbelieves from the groups/parties with Him/it, so the fire (is) his appointment/promise, so do not be in doubt from it, that it is the truth from your Lord, and but most of the people do not believe"
  11,18,"And who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated/cut and split on God lies/denials/falsifications? Those, they are being displayed/exhibited/shown on (to) their Lord, and the witnesses/testifiers (the angels) say: \"Those (are) those who lied/denied/falsified on their Lord.\" Is not God`s curse/torture on the unjust/oppressors"
  11,19,"Those who object/prevent/obstruct from God`s way/path/sake , and they ask/wish/desire it (be) bent/crookedness/indirectness, and they, with the end (other life) they are disbelievers"
