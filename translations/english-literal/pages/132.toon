  6,36,"But those who hear/listen answer/reply, and the deads, God sends/resurrects/revives them, then to Him they return"
  6,37,"And they said: \"If only a sign/verse/evidence was descended on him from his Lord.\" Say: \"That God (is) capable that on to descend a sign/verse/evidence.\" And but most of them do not know"
  6,38,"And (there is) not from a walker/creeper/crawler (creature) in the earth/Planet Earth and nor (a) bird (that) flies with its two wings, except (they are) nations similar/equal to you, We did not neglect/waste in The Book from a thing, then to their Lord they be gathered"
  6,39,"And those who lied/denied with Our verses/signs/evidences (they are) deaf and mute in the darknesses; whom God wants/wills He misguides him, and whom He wants/wills, He puts him on a straight/direct road/way"
  6,40,"Say: \"Did I show you/make you understand, if God`s torture came to you, or the Hour/Resurrection came to you, is (it) other than God you call, if you are/were truthful"
  6,41,"But (only) Him you call, so He removes/uncovers what you call to (for) it, if He wants/wills, and you forget what you share/make partners (with God)"
  6,42,"And We had sent to nations from before you, so We took/punished them with the misery/hardship/fear and the calamity, maybe they become humble and humiliate themselves (to God)"
  6,43,"So where it not for when Our might came to them, they became humble and humiliated themselves, and but their hearts/minds became cruel/merciless, and the devil decorated/beautified for them what they were making/doing"
  6,44,"So when they forgot what they were reminded with it, We opened on them every thing`s doors/entrances, until when they became happy/delighted with what they were given, (then) We took/punished them suddenly, so then they are confused/dumbfounded"
