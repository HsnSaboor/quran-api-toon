  18,55,And what prevented/forbid the people that (E) they believe when the guidance came to them? And they ask for forgiveness (from) their Lord? Except that the first`s/beginner`s law/manner comes to them or the punishment comes to them in front/facing front
  18,56,"And We do not send the messengers except (as) announcers of good news and warners/givers of notice, and those who disbelieved argue/dispute with/by the falsehood to nullify with it the truth , and they took My verses/evidences and what they were warned/given notice (with it) mockingly/making fun"
  18,57,"And who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who was reminded with his Lord`s evidences/signs/verses, so he objected/turned away from it, and he forgot what his two hands advanced/introduced/ undertook , We (E) had made/put covers/protections on their hearts/minds that they understand/know it , and in their ears deafness/weight , and if you call them to the guidance, so they will never/not be guided then ever (E)"
