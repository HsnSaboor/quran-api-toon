  14,6,"And when Moses said to his nation: \"Remember/mention God`s blessing/goodness on you, when He saved/rescued you from Pharaoh`s family, they impose upon you the torture`s harm/evil , and they slaughter your sons and they shame your women, and in that is a great test from your Lord"
  14,7,"And when your Lord announced/informed if (E) you thanked/became grateful, I will increase you (E), and if (E) you disbelieved that My torture (is) strong (E) (severe)"
  14,8,"And Moses said: \"If you disbelieve you and who (is) in the earth/Planet Earth all together, so then God (is) rich (E) praiseworthy/commendable"
  14,9,"Did not information/news (of) those from before you come to you, nation (of) Noah and Aad and Thamud and those from after them? No (one) knows them except God, their messengers came to them with the evidences, so they returned their hands in their mouths (they bit their fingers from anger), and they said: \"We have disbelieved with what you were sent with it, and we are in (E) doubtful/suspicious doubt/suspicion from what you call us to it"
  14,10,"Their messenger said: \"Is (there) doubt/suspicion in God, creator/bringer to being (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, He calls you to forgive for you from your crimes, and He delays you to (a) named/identified term/time?\" They said: \"That you are except humans similar/equal to us, you want/intend that you prevent/obstruct us from what our fathers were worshipping, so come to us/bring to us with a clear/evident proof/evidence"
