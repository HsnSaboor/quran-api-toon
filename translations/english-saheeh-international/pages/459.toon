quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  39,6,"He created you from one soul. Then He made from it its mate, and He produced for you from the grazing livestock eight mates.[1] He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation, within three darknesses.[2] That is Allāh, your Lord; to Him belongs dominion. There is no deity except Him, so how are you averted?","[1] See 6:143-144.\n[2] i.e., the belly, the womb, and the amniotic membrane."
  39,7,"If you disbelieve - indeed, Allāh is Free from need of you. And He does not approve for His servants disbelief. And if you are grateful, He approves [i.e., likes] it for you; and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you about what you used to do. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.",""
  39,8,"And when adversity touches man, he calls upon his Lord, turning to Him [alone]; then when He bestows on him a favor from Himself, he forgets Him whom he called upon before,[1] and he attributes to Allāh equals to mislead [people] from His way. Say, \"Enjoy your disbelief for a little; indeed, you are of the companions of the Fire.\"","[1] Or \"that for which he called upon Him before.\""
  39,9,"Is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night, prostrating and standing [in prayer], fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, [like one who does not]? Say, \"Are those who know equal to those who do not know?\" Only they will remember [who are] people of understanding.",""
  39,10,"Say,[1] \"O My servants who have believed, fear your Lord. For those who do good in this world is good, and the earth of Allāh is spacious. Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account [i.e., limit].\"","[1] The Prophet (ﷺ) is instructed to say on behalf of Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) to His believing servants."
