quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  5,114,"Said Jesus, the son of Mary, \"O Allāh, our Lord, send down to us a table [spread with food] from the heaven to be for us a festival for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from You. And provide for us, and You are the best of providers.\""
  5,115,"Allāh said, \"Indeed, I will send it down to you, but whoever disbelieves afterwards from among you - then indeed will I punish him with a punishment by which I have not punished anyone among the worlds.\""
  5,116,"And [beware the Day] when Allāh will say, \"O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Take me and my mother as deities besides Allāh?'\" He will say, \"Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen."
  5,117,"I said not to them except what You commanded me - to worship Allāh, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them; but when You took me up, You were the Observer over them, and You are, over all things, Witness."
  5,118,"If You should punish them - indeed they are Your servants; but if You forgive them - indeed it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\""
  5,119,"Allāh will say, \"This is the Day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness.\" For them are gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever, Allāh being pleased with them, and they with Him. That is the great attainment."
  5,120,"To Allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is within them. And He is over all things competent."
