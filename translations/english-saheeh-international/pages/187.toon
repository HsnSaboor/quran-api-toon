quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,1,"[This is a declaration of] disassociation, from Allāh and His Messenger, to those with whom you had made a treaty among the polytheists.[1]","[1] But who had violated it."
  9,2,"So travel freely, [O disbelievers], throughout the land [during] four months but know that you cannot cause failure to Allāh and that Allāh will disgrace the disbelievers.",""
  9,3,"And [it is] an announcement from Allāh and His Messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage[1] that Allāh is disassociated from the disbelievers, and [so is] His Messenger. So if you repent, that is best for you; but if you turn away - then know that you will not cause failure to Allāh.[2] And give tidings to those who disbelieve of a painful punishment.","[1] Ḥajj. ʿUmrah is the lesser pilgrimage.\n[2] i.e., you cannot escape His punishment."
  9,4,"Excepted are those with whom you made a treaty among the polytheists and then they have not been deficient toward you in anything or supported anyone against you; so complete for them their treaty until their term [has ended]. Indeed, Allāh loves the righteous [who fear Him].",""
  9,5,"And when the inviolable months[1] have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakāh, let them [go] on their way. Indeed, Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.","[1] The four months mentioned in verse 2, in which the disbelievers were allowed free movement within the land. Other scholars have interpreted them as \"the sacred months,\" i.e., Muḥarram, Rajab, Dhul-Qaʿdah and Dhul-Ḥijjah."
  9,6,"And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of Allāh [i.e., the Qur’ān]. Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.",""
