quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,132,"And for all are degrees [i.e., positions resulting] from what they have done. And your Lord is not unaware of what they do.",""
  6,133,"And your Lord is the Free of need, the possessor of mercy. If He wills, He can do away with you and give succession after you to whomever He wills, just as He produced you from the descendants of another people.",""
  6,134,"Indeed, what you are promised is coming, and you will not cause failure [to Allāh].[1]","[1] i.e., You will neither escape nor prevent its occurrence."
  6,135,"Say, \"O my people, work according to your position; [for] indeed, I am working. And you are going to know who will have succession in the home.[1] Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed.\"","[1] i.e., in the land or in the Hereafter."
  6,136,"And they [i.e., the polytheists] assign to Allāh from that which He created of crops and livestock a share and say, \"This is for Allāh,\" by their claim, \"and this is for our 'partners' [associated with Him].\" But what is for their \"partners\" does not reach Allāh, while what is for Allāh - this reaches their \"partners.\" Evil is that which they rule.",""
  6,137,"And likewise, to many of the polytheists their partners[1] have made [to seem] pleasing the killing of their children in order to bring about their destruction and to cover them with confusion in their religion. And if Allāh had willed, they would not have done so. So leave them and that which they invent.","[1] Their evil associates."
