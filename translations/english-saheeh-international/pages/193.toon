quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,37,"Indeed, the postponing [of restriction within sacred months] is an increase in disbelief by which those who have disbelieved are led [further] astray. They make it[1] lawful one year and unlawful another year to correspond to the number made unlawful by Allāh[2] and [thus] make lawful what Allāh has made unlawful. Made pleasing to them is the evil of their deeds; and Allāh does not guide the disbelieving people.","[1] Fighting during a sacred month.\n[2] If they found it advantageous to violate a sacred month, they would do so, designating another month in its place in which to observe the restrictions concerning fighting."
  9,38,"O you who have believed, what is [the matter] with you that, when you are told to go forth in the cause of Allāh, you adhere heavily to the earth?[1] Are you satisfied with the life of this world rather than the Hereafter? But what is the enjoyment of worldly life compared to the Hereafter except a [very] little.","[1] i.e., inclining toward the comforts of worldly life."
  9,39,"If you do not go forth, He will punish you with a painful punishment and will replace you with another people, and you will not harm Him at all. And Allāh is over all things competent.",""
  9,40,"If you do not aid him [i.e., the Prophet (ﷺ)] - Allāh has already aided him when those who disbelieved had driven him out [of Makkah] as one of two,[1] when they were in the cave and he [i.e., Muḥammad (ﷺ)] said to his companion, \"Do not grieve; indeed Allāh is with us.\" And Allāh sent down His tranquility upon him and supported him with soldiers [i.e., angels] you did not see and made the word[2] of those who disbelieved the lowest,[3] while the word of Allāh[4] - that is the highest. And Allāh is Exalted in Might and Wise.","[1] The second was his companion, Abū Bakr.\n[2] i.e., their claims and slogans.\n[3] i.e., degraded and dishonored.\n[4] \"Lā ilāha ill-Allāh\" (\"There is no deity except Allāh\")."
