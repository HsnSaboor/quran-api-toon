quran[13]{c,v,t,f}:
  72,1,"Say, [O Muḥammad], \"It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, 'Indeed, we have heard an amazing Qur’ān [i.e., recitation].",""
  72,2,"It guides to the right course, and we have believed in it. And we will never associate with our Lord anyone.",""
  72,3,"And [it teaches] that exalted is the nobleness of our Lord; He has not taken a wife or a son",""
  72,4,"And that our foolish one [i.e., Iblees][1] has been saying about Allāh an excessive transgression.","[1] A plural form may also be understood, i.e., \"the foolish ones among us.\""
  72,5,"And we had thought that mankind and the jinn would never speak about Allāh a lie.",""
  72,6,"And there were men from mankind who sought refuge in men from the jinn, so they [only] increased them in burden [i.e., sin].",""
  72,7,"And they had thought, as you thought, that Allāh would never send anyone [as a messenger].",""
  72,8,"And we have sought [to reach] the heaven but found it filled with powerful guards and burning flames.",""
  72,9,"And we used to sit therein in positions for hearing,[1] but whoever listens now will find a burning flame lying in wait for him.","[1] Before the prophethood of Muḥammad (ﷺ) the jinn used to collect information by eavesdropping on the angels and then pass it on to fortunetellers and soothsayers."
  72,10,"And we do not know [therefore] whether evil is intended for those on earth or whether their Lord intends for them a right course.",""
  72,11,"And among us are the righteous, and among us are [others] not so; we were [of] divided ways.[1]","[1] In opinion, belief and religious practice."
  72,12,"And we have become certain that we will never cause failure to Allāh upon earth, nor can we escape Him by flight.",""
  72,13,"And when we heard the guidance [i.e., the Qur’ān], we believed in it. And whoever believes in his Lord will not fear deprivation or burden.[1]","[1] In regard to his account in the Hereafter. Nothing of his good will be diminished, nor will the evil of another be placed upon him."
