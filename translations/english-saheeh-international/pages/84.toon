Indeed, Allāh does not like those who are self-deluding and boastful,","[1] i.e., those whose acquaintance you have made. Also interpreted as the wife."
  4,37,"Who are stingy and enjoin upon [other] people stinginess and conceal what Allāh has given them of His bounty - and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment -",""
