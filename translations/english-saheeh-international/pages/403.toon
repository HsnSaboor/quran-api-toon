  29,54,"They urge you to hasten the punishment. And indeed, Hell will be encompassing of the disbelievers"
  29,55,"On the Day the punishment will cover them from above them and from below their feet and it is said, \"Taste [the result of] what you used to do.\""
  29,56,"O My servants who have believed, indeed My earth is spacious, so worship only Me."
  29,57,"Every soul will taste death. Then to Us will you be returned."
  29,58,"And those who have believed and done righteous deeds - We will surely assign to them of Paradise [elevated] chambers beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. Excellent is the reward of the [righteous] workers"

  29,61,"If you asked them, \"Who created the heavens and earth and subjected the sun and the moon?\" they would surely say, \"Allāh.\" Then how are they deluded?"
  29,62,"Allāh extends provision for whom He wills of His servants and restricts for him. Indeed Allāh is, of all things, Knowing."
  29,63,"And if you asked them, \"Who sends down rain from the sky and gives life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness?\" they would surely say, \"Allāh.\" Say, \"Praise to Allāh\"; but most of them do not reason."
