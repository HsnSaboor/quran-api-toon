quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  12,31,"So when she heard of their scheming, she sent for them and prepared for them a banquet and gave each one of them a knife and said [to Joseph], \"Come out before them.\" And when they saw him, they greatly admired him and cut their hands[1] and said, \"Perfect is Allāh![2] This is not a man; this is none but a noble angel.\"","[1] So distracted were they at the sight of him.\n[2] In His ability to create such beauty."
  12,32,"She said, \"That is the one about whom you blamed me. And I certainly sought to seduce him, but he firmly refused; and if he will not do what I order him, he will surely be imprisoned and will be of those debased.\"",""
  12,33,"He said, \"My Lord, prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me. And if You do not avert from me their plan, I might incline toward them and [thus] be of the ignorant.\"",""
  12,34,"So his Lord responded to him and averted from him their plan. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.",""
  12,35,"Then it appeared to them after they had seen the signs[1] that he [i.e., al-ʿAzeez] should surely imprison him for a time.[2]","[1] Proofs of his innocence.\n[2] Until the scandal be forgotten."
  12,36,"And there entered the prison with him two young men. One of them said, \"Indeed, I have seen myself [in a dream] pressing [grapes for] wine.\" The other said, \"Indeed, I have seen myself carrying upon my head [some] bread, from which the birds were eating. Inform us of its interpretation; indeed, we see you to be of those who do good.\"",""
  12,37,"He said, \"You will not receive food that is provided to you except that I will inform you of its interpretation before it comes to you. That is from what my Lord has taught me. Indeed, I have left the religion of a people who do not believe in Allāh, and they, in the Hereafter, are disbelievers.",""
