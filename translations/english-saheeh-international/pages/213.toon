quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  10,34,"Say, \"Are there of your 'partners' any who begins creation and then repeats it?\" Say, \"Allāh begins creation and then repeats it, so how are you deluded?\"",""
  10,35,"Say, \"Are there of your 'partners' any who guides to the truth?\" Say, \"Allāh guides to the truth. So is He who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed or he who guides not unless he is guided? Then what is [wrong] with you - how do you judge?\"",""
  10,36,"And most of them follow not except assumption. Indeed, assumption avails not against the truth at all. Indeed, Allāh is Knowing of what they do.",""
  10,37,"And it was not [possible] for this Qur’ān to be produced by other than Allāh, but [it is] a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed explanation of the [former] Scripture, about which there is no doubt,[1] from the Lord of the worlds.","[1] This phrase refers back to the Qur’ān."
  10,38,"Or do they say [about the Prophet (ﷺ)], \"He invented it?\" Say, \"Then bring forth a sūrah like it and call upon [for assistance] whomever you can besides Allāh, if you should be truthful.\"",""
  10,39,"Rather, they have denied that which they encompass not in knowledge and whose interpretation has not yet come to them. Thus did those before them deny. Then observe how was the end of the wrongdoers.",""
  10,40,"And of them are those who believe in it, and of them are those who do not believe in it. And your Lord is most knowing of the corrupters.",""
  10,41,"And if they deny you, [O Muḥammad], then say, \"For me are my deeds, and for you are your deeds. You are disassociated from what I do, and I am disassociated from what you do.\"",""
  10,42,"And among them are those who listen to you. But can you cause the deaf to hear [i.e., benefit from this hearing], although they will not use reason?",""
