quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  16,88,"Those who disbelieved and averted [others] from the way of Allāh - We will increase them in punishment over [their] punishment for what corruption they were causing.",""
  16,89,"And [mention] the Day when We will resurrect among every nation a witness over them from themselves [i.e., their prophet]. And We will bring you, [O Muḥammad], as a witness over these [i.e., your nation]. And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things and as guidance and mercy and good tidings for the Muslims.[1]","[1] Those who have submitted themselves to Allāh."
  16,90,"Indeed, Allāh orders justice and good conduct and giving [help] to relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded.",""
  16,91,"And fulfill the covenant of Allāh when you have taken it, [O believers], and do not break oaths after their confirmation while you have made Allāh, over you, a security [i.e., witness]. Indeed, Allāh knows what you do.",""
  16,92,"And do not be like she who untwisted her spun thread after it was strong [by] taking your oaths as [means of] deceit between you because one community is more plentiful [in number or wealth] than another community.[1] Allāh only tries you thereby. And He will surely make clear to you on the Day of Resurrection that over which you used to differ.","[1] i.e., do not swear falsely or break a treaty or contract merely for a worldly advantage."
  16,93,"And if Allāh had willed, He could have made you [of] one religion, but He sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills.[1] And you will surely be questioned about what you used to do.","[1] According to His knowledge of each soul's preference."
