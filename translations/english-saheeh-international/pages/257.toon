  14,11,"Their messengers said to them, \"We are only men like you, but Allāh confers favor upon whom He wills of His servants. It has never been for us to bring you evidence except by permission of Allāh. And upon Allāh let the believers rely.",""
  14,12,"And why should we not rely upon Allāh while He has guided us to our [good] ways. And we will surely be patient against whatever harm you should cause us. And upon Allāh let those who would rely [indeed] rely.\"",""
  14,13,"And those who disbelieved said to their messengers, \"We will surely drive you out of our land, or you must return to our religion.\" So their Lord inspired to them, \"We will surely destroy the wrongdoers.",""
  14,14,"And We will surely cause you to dwell in the land after them. That is for he who fears My position[1] and fears My threat.\"","[1] An alternative meaning is \"the standing [for account] before Me.\""
  14,15,"And they requested decision [i.e., victory from Allāh], and disappointed, [therefore], was every obstinate tyrant.",""
  14,16,"Before him[1] is Hell, and he will be given a drink of purulent water.[2]","[1] Literally, \"after him [in time],\" meaning ahead of him.\n[2] That which oozes from the skins of Hell's inhabitants."
  14,17,"He will gulp it but will hardly [be able to] swallow it. And death will come to him from everywhere, but he is not to die. And before him is a massive punishment.",""
  14,18,"The example of those who disbelieve in their Lord is [that] their deeds are like ashes which the wind blows forcefully on a stormy day; they are unable [to keep] from what they earned a [single] thing. That is what is extreme error.",""
