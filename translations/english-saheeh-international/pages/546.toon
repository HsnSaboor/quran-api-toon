quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  59,4,"That is because they opposed Allāh and His Messenger. And whoever opposes Allāh - then indeed, Allāh is severe in penalty.",""
  59,5,"Whatever you have cut down of [their] palm trees or left standing on their trunks - it was by permission of Allāh and so He would disgrace the defiantly disobedient.",""
  59,6,"And what Allāh restored [of property] to His Messenger from them - you did not spur for it [in an expedition] any horses or camels,[1] but Allāh gives His messengers power over whom He wills, and Allāh is over all things competent.","[1] Meaning that they went through no hardship (i.e., war) to obtain it."
  59,7,"And what Allāh restored to His Messenger from the people of the towns - it is for Allāh and for the Messenger and for [his] near relatives[1] and orphans and the needy and the [stranded] traveler[2] - so that it will not be a perpetual distribution among the rich from among you. And whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from. And fear Allāh; indeed, Allāh is severe in penalty.","[1] Those of Banū Hāshim and Banū Muṭṭalib, whom he (ﷺ) had prohibited from accepting zakāh.\n[2] This ruling concerning properties abandoned by an enemy without a war effort differs from that in Sūrah al-Anfāl, verse 41, which refers to spoils of war in which four fifths is distributed among those who fought in Allāh's cause."
  59,8,"For the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their properties, seeking bounty from Allāh and [His] approval and supporting [the cause of] Allāh and His Messenger, [there is also a share]. Those are the truthful.",""
  59,9,"And [also for] those who were settled in the Home [i.e.,al-Madīnah] and [adopted] the faith before them.[1] They love those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their breasts of what they [i.e., the emigrants] were given but give [them] preference over themselves, even though they are in privation. And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul - it is those who will be the successful.","[1] Before the settlement of the emigrants (Muhājireen) among the Anṣār, for whom a share is delegated as well."
