quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  48,16,"Say to those who remained behind of the bedouins, \"You will be called to [face] a people of great military might; you may fight them, or they will submit.[1] So if you obey, Allāh will give you a good reward; but if you turn away as you turned away before, He will punish you with a painful punishment.\"","[1] To Allāh in Islām."
  48,17,"There is not upon the blind any guilt or upon the lame any guilt or upon the ill any guilt [for remaining behind]. And whoever obeys Allāh and His Messenger - He will admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow; but whoever turns away - He will punish him with a painful punishment.",""
  48,18,"Certainly was Allāh pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you, [O Muḥammad], under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquility upon them and rewarded them with an imminent conquest[1]","[1] That of Khaybar, which preceded the conquest of Makkah."
  48,19,"And much war booty which they will take. And ever is Allāh Exalted in Might and Wise.",""
  48,20,"Allāh has promised you much booty that you will take [in the future] and has hastened for you this [victory] and withheld the hands of people from you - that it may be a sign for the believers and [that] He may guide you to a straight path.",""
  48,21,"And [He promises] other [victories] that you were [so far] unable to [realize] which Allāh has already encompassed.[1] And ever is Allāh, over all things, competent.","[1] i.e., prepared for you or decreed."
  48,22,"And if those [Makkans] who disbelieve had fought you, they would have turned their backs [in flight]. Then they would not find a protector or a helper.",""
  48,23,"[This is] the established way of Allāh which has occurred before. And never will you find in the way of Allāh any change.",""
