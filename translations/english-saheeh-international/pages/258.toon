quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  14,19,"Have you not seen [i.e., considered] that Allāh created the heavens and the earth in truth? If He wills, He can do away with you and produce a new creation.",""
  14,20,"And that is not difficult for Allāh.",""
  14,21,"And they will come out [for judgement] before Allāh all together, and the weak will say to those who were arrogant, \"Indeed, we were your followers, so can you avail us anything against the punishment of Allāh?\" They will say, \"If Allāh had guided us, we would have guided you. It is all the same for us whether we show intolerance or are patient: there is for us no place of escape.\"",""
  14,22,"And Satan will say when the matter has been concluded, \"Indeed, Allāh had promised you the promise of truth. And I promised you, but I betrayed you. But I had no authority over you except that I invited you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; but blame yourselves. I cannot be called to your aid, nor can you be called to my aid. Indeed, I deny your association of me [with Allāh] before.[1] Indeed, for the wrongdoers is a painful punishment.\"","[1] By your obedience to me instead of Him during life on earth."
  14,23,"And those who believed and did righteous deeds will be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding eternally therein by permission of their Lord; and their greeting therein will be, \"Peace!\"",""
  14,24,"Have you not considered how Allāh presents an example, [making] a good word like a good tree, whose root is firmly fixed and its branches [high] in the sky?",""
