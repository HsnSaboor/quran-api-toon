quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  66,1,"O Prophet, why do you prohibit [yourself from] what Allāh has made lawful for you, seeking the approval of your wives? And Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.",""
  66,2,"Allāh has already ordained for you [Muslims] the dissolution of your oaths.[1] And Allāh is your protector, and He is the Knowing, the Wise.","[1] By means of a kaffārah (expiation). This is required when one is unable to fulfill an oath or when one has taken an oath which would not be pleasing to Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā). See 5:89."
  66,3,"And [remember] when the Prophet confided to one of his wives a statement; and when she informed [another] of it and Allāh showed it to him, he made known part of it and ignored a part. And when he informed her about it, she said, \"Who told you this?\" He said, \"I was informed by the Knowing, the Aware.\"",""
  66,4,"If you two [wives] repent to Allāh, [it is best], for your hearts have deviated. But if you cooperate against him - then indeed Allāh is his protector, and Gabriel and the righteous of the believers and the angels, moreover, are [his] assistants.",""
  66,5,"Perhaps his Lord, if he divorced you [all], would substitute for him wives better than you - submitting [to Allāh], believing, devoutly obedient, repentant, worshipping, and traveling[1] - [ones] previously married and virgins.","[1] Emigrating for the cause of Allāh. Another meaning is \"given to fasting.\""
  66,6,"O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones, over which are [appointed] angels, harsh and severe; they do not disobey Allāh in what He commands them but do what they are commanded.",""
  66,7,"O you who have disbelieved, make no excuses that Day. You will only be recompensed for what you used to do.",""
