quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,171,"And [mention] when We raised the mountain above them as if it was a dark cloud and they were certain that it would fall upon them,[1] [and Allāh said], \"Take what We have given you with determination and remember what is in it that you might fear Allāh.\"","[1] For their rebellion and disobedience."
  7,172,"And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], \"Am I not your Lord?\" They said, \"Yes, we have testified.\" [This] - lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, \"Indeed, we were of this unaware.\"",""
  7,173,"Or [lest] you say, \"It was only that our fathers associated [others in worship] with Allāh before, and we were but descendants after them. Then would You destroy us for what the falsifiers have done?\"",""
  7,174,"And thus do We [explain in] detail the verses, and perhaps they will return.[1]","[1] To the way of Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā), from their diversions and deviations."
  7,175,"And recite to them, [O Muḥammad], the news of him[1] to whom We gave [knowledge of] Our signs, but he detached himself from them; so Satan pursued him, and he became of the deviators.[2]","[1] A man from the Children of Israel at the time of Moses.\n[2] Those who deliberately persist in error to the point of destruction."
  7,176,"And if We had willed, We could have elevated him thereby,[1] but he adhered [instead] to the earth[2] and followed his own desire. So his example is like that of the dog: if you chase him, he pants, or if you leave him, he [still] pants. That is the example of the people who denied Our signs.[3] So relate the stories that perhaps they will give thought.","[1] i.e., through the revelations, signs or evidences of which he had been given knowledge.\n[2] i.e., its worldly pleasures.\n[3] Whether or not they have been exposed to Allāh's signs or warnings, it is all the same: they will not believe."
  7,177,"How evil an example [is that of] the people who denied Our signs and used to wrong themselves.",""
  7,178,"Whoever Allāh guides - he is the [rightly] guided; and whoever He sends astray[1] - it is those who are the losers.","[1] As a result of persistence in evil and rejection of truth."
