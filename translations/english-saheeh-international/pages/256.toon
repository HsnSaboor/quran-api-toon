quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  14,6,"And [recall, O Children of Israel], when Moses said to his people, \"Remember the favor of Allāh upon you when He saved you from the people of Pharaoh, who were afflicting you with the worst torment and were slaughtering your [newborn] sons and keeping your females alive. And in that was a great trial from your Lord.",""
  14,7,"And [remember] when your Lord proclaimed, 'If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favor]; but if you deny, indeed, My punishment is severe.'\"",""
  14,8,"And Moses said, \"If you should disbelieve, you and whoever is on the earth entirely - indeed, Allāh is Free of need and Praiseworthy.\"",""
  14,9,"Has there not reached you the news of those before you - the people of Noah and ʿAad and Thamūd and those after them? No one knows them [i.e., their number] but Allāh. Their messengers brought them clear proofs, but they returned their hands to their mouths[1] and said, \"Indeed, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent, and indeed we are, about that to which you invite us, in disquieting doubt.\"","[1] Several explanations have been given as to the meaning. Based upon the conclusion of the verse, Ibn Katheer preferred that this was a gesture of denial and rejection."
  14,10,"Their messengers said, \"Can there be doubt about Allāh, Creator of the heavens and earth? He invites you that He may forgive you of your sins, and He delays you [i.e., your death] for a specified term.\" They said, \"You are not but men like us who wish to avert us from what our fathers were worshipping. So bring us a clear authority [i.e., evidence].\"",""
