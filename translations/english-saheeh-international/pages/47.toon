quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,275,"Those who consume interest[1] cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into insanity. That is because they say, \"Trade is [just] like interest.\" But Allāh has permitted trade and has forbidden interest. So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past, and his affair rests with Allāh. But whoever returns [to dealing in interest or usury] - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide eternally therein.","[1] Included is that given on commercial as well as consumer loans."
  2,276,"Allāh destroys interest and gives increase for charities. And Allāh does not like every sinning disbeliever.",""
  2,277,"Indeed, those who believe and do righteous deeds and establish prayer and give zakāh will have their reward with their Lord, and there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.",""
  2,278,"O you who have believed, fear Allāh and give up what remains [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers.",""
  2,279,"And if you do not, then be informed of a war [against you] from Allāh and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may have your principal - [thus] you do no wrong, nor are you wronged.",""
  2,280,"And if someone is in hardship, then [let there be] postponement until [a time of] ease. But if you give [from your right as] charity, then it is better for you, if you only knew.",""
  2,281,"And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allāh. Then every soul will be compensated for what it earned, and they will not be wronged [i.e., treated unjustly].",""
