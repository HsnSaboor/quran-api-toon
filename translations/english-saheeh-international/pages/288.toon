  17,59,"And nothing has prevented Us from sending signs [i.e., miracles] except that the former peoples denied them. And We gave Thamūd the she-camel as a visible sign, but they wronged her. And We send not the signs except as a warning.",""
  17,60,"And [remember, O Muḥammad], when We told you, \"Indeed, your Lord has encompassed the people.\"[1] And We did not make the sight which We showed you[2] except as a trial for the people, as was the accursed tree [mentioned] in the Qur’ān. And We threaten [i.e., warn] them, but it increases them not except in great transgression.","[1] In His knowledge and power, meaning that Allāh would protect him (ﷺ) from their harm.\n[2] During the miʿrāj (ascension) into the heavens."
