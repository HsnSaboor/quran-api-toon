  40,34,"And Joseph had already come to you before with clear proofs, but you remained in doubt of that which he brought to you, until when he died, you said, 'Never will Allāh send a messenger after him.' Thus does Allāh leave astray he who is a transgressor and skeptic.\"",""
  40,35,"Those who dispute concerning the signs of Allāh without an authority[1] having come to them - great is hatred [of them] in the sight of Allāh and in the sight of those who have believed. Thus does Allāh seal over every heart [belonging to] an arrogant tyrant.","[1] i.e., evidence."
  40,36,"And Pharaoh said, \"O Hāmān, construct for me a tower that I might reach the ways[1] -","[1] Means of ascent, pathways."
  40,37,"The ways into the heavens - so that I may look at the deity of Moses; but indeed, I think he is a liar.\" And thus was made attractive to Pharaoh the evil of his deed, and he was averted from the [right] way. And the plan of Pharaoh was not except in ruin.",""
  40,38,"And he who believed said, \"O my people, follow me; I will guide you to the way of right conduct.",""
  40,39,"O my people, this worldly life is only [temporary] enjoyment, and indeed, the Hereafter - that is the home of [permanent] settlement.",""
  40,40,"Whoever does an evil deed will not be recompensed except by the like thereof; but whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - those will enter Paradise, being given provision therein without account.",""
