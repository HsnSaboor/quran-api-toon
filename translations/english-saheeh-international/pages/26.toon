quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,170,"And when it is said to them, \"Follow what Allāh has revealed,\" they say, \"Rather, we will follow that which we found our fathers doing.\" Even though their fathers understood nothing, nor were they guided?",""
  2,171,"The example of those who disbelieve is like that of one who shouts at what hears nothing but calls and cries [i.e., cattle or sheep] - deaf, dumb and blind, so they do not understand.",""
  2,172,"O you who have believed, eat from the good [i.e., lawful] things which We have provided for you and be grateful to Allāh if it is [indeed] Him that you worship.",""
  2,173,"He has only forbidden to you dead animals,[1] blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allāh. But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit], there is no sin upon him. Indeed, Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.","[1] Those not slaughtered or hunted expressly for food."
  2,174,"Indeed, they who conceal what Allāh has sent down of the Book and exchange it for a small price - those consume not into their bellies except the Fire. And Allāh will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them. And they will have a painful punishment.",""
  2,175,"Those are the ones who have exchanged guidance for error and forgiveness for punishment. How patient they are for [i.e., in pursuit of] the Fire!",""
  2,176,"That is [deserved by them] because Allāh has sent down the Book in truth. And indeed, those who differ over the Book are in extreme dissension.",""
