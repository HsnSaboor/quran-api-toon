quran[11]{c,v,t,f}:
  18,35,"And he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself.[1] He said, \"I do not think that this will perish - ever.","[1] i.e., proud and ungrateful to Allāh."
  18,36,"And I do not think the Hour will occur. And even if I should be brought back to my Lord, I will surely find better than this as a return.\"",""
  18,37,"His companion said to him while he was conversing with him, \"Have you disbelieved in He who created you from dust and then from a sperm-drop and then proportioned you [as] a man?",""
  18,38,"But as for me, He is Allāh, my Lord, and I do not associate with my Lord anyone.",""
  18,39,"And why did you, when you entered your garden, not say, 'What Allāh willed [has occurred]; there is no power except in Allāh'? Although you see me less than you in wealth and children,",""
  18,40,"It may be that my Lord will give me [something] better than your garden and will send upon it a [disastrous] penalty from the sky, and it will become a smooth, dusty ground,",""
  18,41,"Or its water will become sunken [into the earth], so you would never be able to seek it.\"",""
  18,42,"And his fruits were encompassed [by ruin], so he began to turn his hands about [in dismay] over what he had spent on it, while it had collapsed upon its trellises, and said, \"Oh, I wish I had not associated with my Lord anyone.\"[1]","[1] He attributed his prosperity to himself rather than to Allāh and disbelieved in the account of the Hereafter."
  18,43,"And there was for him no company to aid him other than Allāh, nor could he defend himself.",""
  18,44,"There[1] the authority is [completely] for Allāh, the Truth. He is best in reward and best in outcome.","[1] i.e., at such a time or on the Day of Judgement."
  18,45,"And present to them the example of the life of this world, [its being] like rain which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it[1] and [then] it becomes dry remnants, scattered by the winds. And Allāh is ever, over all things, Perfect in Ability.","[1] Absorbs it, growing lush and thick."
