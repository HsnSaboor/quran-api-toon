quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  24,21,"O you who have believed, do not follow the footsteps of Satan. And whoever follows the footsteps of Satan - indeed, he enjoins immorality and wrongdoing. And if not for the favor of Allāh upon you and His mercy, not one of you would have been pure, ever, but Allāh purifies whom He wills, and Allāh is Hearing and Knowing.",""
  24,22,"And let not those of virtue among you and wealth swear not to give [aid] to their relatives and the needy and the emigrants for the cause of Allāh, and let them pardon and overlook. Would you not like that Allāh should forgive you? And Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.",""
  24,23,"Indeed, those who [falsely] accuse chaste, unaware and believing women are cursed in this world and the Hereafter; and they will have a great punishment",""
  24,24,"On a Day when their tongues, their hands and their feet will bear witness against them as to what they used to do.",""
  24,25,"That Day, Allāh will pay them in full their true [i.e., deserved] recompense, and they will know that it is Allāh who is the manifest Truth [i.e., perfect in justice].",""
  24,26,"Evil words are for evil men, and evil men are [subjected] to evil words. And good words are for good men, and good men are [an object] of good words.[1] Those [good people] are declared innocent of what they [i.e., slanderers] say. For them is forgiveness and noble provision.","[1] Another accepted interpretation is \"Evil women are for evil men, and evil men are for evil women. And good women are for good men, and good men are for good women.\""
  24,27,"O you who have believed, do not enter houses other than your own houses until you ascertain welcome and greet[1] their inhabitants. That is best for you; perhaps you will be reminded [i.e., advised].","[1] By the words \"As-salāmu ʿalaykum\" (\"Peace be upon you\")."
