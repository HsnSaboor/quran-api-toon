quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,32,"They want to extinguish the light of Allāh with their mouths, but Allāh refuses except to perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it.",""
  9,33,"It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion, although they who associate others with Allāh dislike it.",""
  9,34,"O you who have believed, indeed many of the scholars and the monks devour the wealth of people unjustly[1] and avert [them] from the way of Allāh. And those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allāh - give them tidings of a painful punishment.","[1] i.e., through false pretense."
  9,35,"The Day when it[1] will be heated in the fire of Hell and seared therewith will be their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs, [it will be said], \"This is what you hoarded for yourselves, so taste what you used to hoard.\"","[1] The gold and silver which was hoarded, i.e., whose zakāh was not paid."
  9,36,"Indeed, the number of months with Allāh is twelve [lunar] months in the register of Allāh [from] the day He created the heavens and the earth; of these, four are sacred.[1] That is the correct religion [i.e., way], so do not wrong yourselves during them.[2] And fight against the disbelievers collectively as they fight against you collectively. And know that Allāh is with the righteous [who fear Him].","[1] See footnote to 9:5.\n[2] i.e., do not violate the sacred months or commit aggression therein."
