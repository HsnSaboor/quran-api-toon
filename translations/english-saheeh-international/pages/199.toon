  9,73,"O Prophet, fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them. And their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination.",""
  9,74,"They swear by Allāh that they did not say [anything against the Prophet (ﷺ)] while they had said the word of disbelief and disbelieved after their [pretense of] Islām and planned that which they were not to attain.[1] And they were not resentful except [for the fact] that Allāh and His Messenger had enriched them of His bounty.[2] So if they repent, it is better for them; but if they turn away, Allāh will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. And there will not be for them on earth any protector or helper.","[1] i.e., the murder of Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ).\n[2] i.e., for no reason. On the contrary, they should have been grateful."
  9,75,"And among them are those who made a covenant with Allāh, [saying], \"If He should give us from His bounty, we will surely spend in charity, and we will surely be among the righteous.\"",""
  9,76,"But when He gave them from His bounty, they were stingy with it and turned away while they refused.",""
  9,77,"So He penalized them with hypocrisy in their hearts until the Day they will meet Him - because they failed Allāh in what they promised Him and because they [habitually] used to lie.",""
  9,78,"Did they not know that Allāh knows their secrets and their private conversations and that Allāh is the Knower of the unseen?",""
  9,79,"Those who criticize the contributors among the believers concerning [their] charities and [criticize] the ones who find nothing [to spend] except their effort, so they ridicule them - Allāh will ridicule them, and they will have a painful punishment.",""
