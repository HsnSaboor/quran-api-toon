  41,39,"And of His signs is that you see the earth stilled, but when We send down upon it rain, it quivers and grows. Indeed, He who has given it life is the Giver of Life to the dead. Indeed, He is over all things competent.",""
  41,40,"Indeed, those who inject deviation into Our verses[1] are not concealed from Us. So, is he who is cast into the Fire better or he who comes secure on the Day of Resurrection? Do whatever you will; indeed, He is Seeing of what you do.","[1] Through deviant recitations or interpretations."
  41,41,"Indeed, those who disbelieve in the message [i.e., the Qur’ān][1] after it has come to them...[2] And indeed, it is a mighty[3] Book.","[1] i.e., reject it or prefer deviant interpretation.\n[2] The conclusion is understood to be \"...will have earned an indescribable punishment.\"\n[3] Inimitable, resistant to attack, protected by Allāh."
  41,42,"Falsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it; [it is] a revelation from a [Lord who is] Wise and Praiseworthy.",""
  41,43,"Nothing is said to you, [O Muḥammad], except what was already said to the messengers before you. Indeed, your Lord is a possessor of forgiveness and a possessor of painful penalty.",""
  41,44,"And if We had made it a foreign [i.e., non-Arabic] Qur’ān, they would have said, \"Why are its verses not explained in detail [in our language]? Is it a foreign [recitation] and an Arab [messenger]?\" Say, \"It is, for those who believe, a guidance and cure.\" And those who do not believe - in their ears is deafness, and it is upon them blindness. Those are being called from a distant place.[1]","[1] For all practical purposes, since they neither hear nor understand."
  41,45,"And We had already given Moses the Scripture, but it came under disagreement.[1] And if not for a word [i.e., decree][2] that preceded from your Lord, it would have been concluded between them. And indeed they are, concerning it [i.e., the Qur’ān], in disquieting doubt.","[1] An alternative meaning is \"he was opposed over it.\"\n[2] See footnote to 10:19."
  41,46,"Whoever does righteousness - it is for his [own] soul; and whoever does evil [does so] against it. And your Lord is not ever unjust to [His] servants.",""
