quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,80,"He who obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allāh; but those who turn away - We have not sent you over them as a guardian.",""
  4,81,"And they say, \"[We pledge] obedience.\" But when they leave you, a group of them spend the night determining to do other than what you say. But Allāh records what they plan by night. So leave them alone and rely upon Allāh. And sufficient is Allāh as Disposer of affairs.",""
  4,82,"Then do they not reflect upon the Qur’ān?[1] If it had been from [any] other than Allāh, they would have found within it much contradiction.","[1] i.e., its meanings and its objective."
  4,83,"And when there comes to them something [i.e., information] about [public] security or fear, they spread it around. But if they had referred it back to the Messenger or to those of authority among them, then the ones who [can] draw correct conclusions from it would have known about it. And if not for the favor of Allāh upon you and His mercy, you would have followed Satan, except for a few.",""
  4,84,"So fight, [O Muḥammad], in the cause of Allāh; you are not held responsible except for yourself. And encourage the believers [to join you] that perhaps Allāh will restrain the [military] might of those who disbelieve. And Allāh is greater in might and stronger in [exemplary] punishment.[1]","[1] Allāh is able to defeat them in such a way as to deter others from attempting anything similar."
  4,85,"Whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a share [i.e., reward] therefrom; and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a portion [i.e., burden] therefrom. And ever is Allāh, over all things, a Keeper.[1]","[1] Providing, protecting, witnessing, keeping precise records and capable of recompense."
  4,86,"And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet [in return] with one better than it or [at least] return it [in a like manner]. Indeed Allāh is ever, over all things, an Accountant.",""
