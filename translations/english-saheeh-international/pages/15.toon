quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,94,"Say, [O Muḥammad], \"If the home of the Hereafter with Allāh is for you alone and not the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful.\""
  2,95,"But never will they wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have put forth. And Allāh is Knowing of the wrongdoers."
  2,96,"And you will surely find them the most greedy of people for life - [even] more than those who associate others with Allāh. One of them wishes that he could be granted life a thousand years, but it would not remove him in the least from the [coming] punishment that he should be granted life. And Allāh is Seeing of what they do."
  2,97,"Say, \"Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel - it is [none but] he who has brought it [i.e., the Qur’ān] down upon your heart, [O Muḥammad], by permission of Allāh, confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers.\""
  2,98,"Whoever is an enemy to Allāh and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael - then indeed, Allāh is an enemy to the disbelievers."
  2,99,"And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient."
  2,100,"Is it not [true] that every time they took a covenant a party of them threw it away? But, [in fact], most of them do not believe."
  2,101,"And when a messenger from Allāh came to them confirming that which was with them, a party of those who had been given the Scripture threw the Scripture of Allāh [i.e., the Torah] behind their backs as if they did not know [what it contained]."
