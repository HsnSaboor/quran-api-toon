quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,37,"They will wish to get out of the Fire, but never are they to emerge therefrom, and for them is an enduring punishment.",""
  5,38,"[As for] the thief, the male and the female, amputate their hands in recompense for what they earned [i.e., committed] as a deterrent [punishment] from Allāh. And Allāh is Exalted in Might and Wise.",""
  5,39,"But whoever repents after his wrongdoing and reforms, indeed, Allāh will turn to him in forgiveness. Indeed, Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.",""
  5,40,"Do you not know that to Allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He wills and forgives whom He wills, and Allāh is over all things competent.",""
  5,41,"O Messenger, let them not grieve you who hasten into disbelief – of those who say, \"We believe\" with their mouths, but their hearts believe not, and from among the Jews. [They are] avid listeners to falsehood, listening to another people who have not come to you.[1] They distort words beyond their [proper] places [i.e., usages], saying, \"If you are given this,[2] take it; but if you are not given it, then beware.\" But he for whom Allāh intends fitnah[3] - never will you possess [power to do] for him a thing against Allāh. Those are the ones for whom Allāh does not intend to purify their hearts. For them in this world is disgrace, and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.","[1] They had not attended the Prophet's gatherings or heard his words.\n[2] The legal ruling desired by them.\n[3] The meaning here is misbelief, misconception, or self-delusion as a result of one's own refusal of truth."
