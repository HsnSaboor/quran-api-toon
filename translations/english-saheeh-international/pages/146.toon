quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,138,"And they say, \"These animals[1] and crops are forbidden; no one may eat from them except whom we will,\" by their claim. And there are those [camels] whose backs are forbidden [by them][2] and those upon which the name of Allāh is not mentioned[3] - [all of this] an invention of untruth about Him.[4] He will punish them for what they were inventing.","[1] The four categories of grazing livestock called \"anʿām\" collectively.\n[2] See 5:103.\n[3] At the time of slaughter. Rather, they are dedicated to others among their \"deities.\"\n[4] i.e., false assertions that such practices are part of Allāh's religion."
  6,139,"And they say, \"What is in the bellies of these animals[1] is exclusively for our males and forbidden to our females. But if it is [born] dead, then all of them have shares therein.\" He will punish them for their description.[2] Indeed, He is Wise and Knowing.","[1] i.e., their milk and offspring.\n[2] Of what is lawful and unlawful according to their whims."
  6,140,"They will have lost who killed their children in foolishness without knowledge and prohibited what Allāh had provided for them, inventing untruth about Allāh. They have gone astray and were not [rightly] guided.",""
  6,141,"And He it is who causes gardens to grow, [both] trellised and untrellised, and palm trees and crops of different [kinds of] food and olives and pomegranates, similar and dissimilar. Eat of [each of] its fruit when it yields and give its due [zakāh] on the day of its harvest. And be not excessive.[1] Indeed, He does not like those who commit excess.","[1] In eating, as well as in all things generally."
  6,142,"And of the grazing livestock are carriers [of burdens] and those [too] small. Eat of what Allāh has provided for you and do not follow the footsteps of Satan.[1] Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.","[1] As the disbelievers have done in making their own rulings about what is permissible and what is prohibited."
