quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,171,"O People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion[1] or say about Allāh except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, was but a messenger of Allāh and His word which He directed to Mary and a soul [created at a command] from Him. So believe in Allāh and His messengers. And do not say, \"Three\"; desist - it is better for you. Indeed, Allāh is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is Allāh as Disposer of affairs.","[1] Such as attributing divine qualities to certain creations of Allāh or revering them excessively."
  4,172,"Never would the Messiah disdain to be a servant of Allāh, nor would the angels near [to Him]. And whoever disdains His worship and is arrogant - He will gather them to Himself all together.",""
  4,173,"And as for those who believed and did righteous deeds, He will give them in full their rewards and grant them extra from His bounty. But as for those who disdained and were arrogant, He will punish them with a painful punishment, and they will not find for themselves besides Allāh any protector or helper.",""
  4,174,"O mankind, there has come to you a conclusive proof from your Lord, and We have sent down to you a clear light.[1]","[1] Showing the truth (i.e., the Qur’ān)."
  4,175,"So those who believe in Allāh and hold fast to Him - He will admit them to mercy from Himself and bounty and guide them to Himself on a straight path.",""
