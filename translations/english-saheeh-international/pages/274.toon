quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  16,65,"And Allāh has sent down rain from the sky and given life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who listen.",""
  16,66,"And indeed, for you in grazing livestock is a lesson. We give you drink from what is in their bellies - between excretion and blood - pure milk, palatable to drinkers.",""
  16,67,"And from the fruits of the palm trees and grapevines you take intoxicant and good provision.[1] Indeed in that is a sign for a people who reason.","[1] This verse was revealed before the prohibition of intoxicants. It alludes to the fact that there are both evil and good possibilities in certain things."
  16,68,"And your Lord inspired to the bee, \"Take for yourself among the mountains, houses [i.e., hives], and among the trees and [in] that which they construct.",""
  16,69,"Then eat from all the fruits[1] and follow the ways of your Lord laid down [for you].\" There emerges from their bellies a drink, varying in colors, in which there is healing for people. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought.","[1] i.e., delicious substances found by the bee."
  16,70,"And Allāh created you; then He will take you in death. And among you is he who is reversed to the most decrepit [old] age so that he will not know, after [having had] knowledge, a thing. Indeed, Allāh is Knowing and Competent.",""
  16,71,"And Allāh has favored some of you over others in provision. But those who were favored [i.e., given more] would not hand over their provision to those whom their right hands possess [i.e., slaves] so they would be equal to them therein.[1] Then is it the favor of Allāh they reject?","[1] The argument presented in this verse is that if they cannot consider their own possessions equal to themselves, then how can they consider Allāh's creations as being equal to Him?"
  16,72,"And Allāh has made for you from yourselves mates and has made for you from your mates sons and grandchildren and has provided for you from the good things. Then in falsehood do they believe and in the favor of Allāh they disbelieve?",""
