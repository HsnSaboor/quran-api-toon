quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  12,70,"So when he had furnished them with their supplies, he put the [gold measuring] bowl into the bag of his brother. Then an announcer called out, \"O caravan, indeed you are thieves.\"",""
  12,71,"They said while approaching them, \"What is it you are missing?\"",""
  12,72,"They said, \"We are missing the measure of the king. And for he who produces it is [the reward of] a camel's load, and I am responsible for it.\"",""
  12,73,"They said, \"By Allāh, you have certainly known that we did not come to cause corruption in the land, and we have not been thieves.\"",""
  12,74,"They [the accusers] said, \"Then what would be its recompense[1] if you should be liars?\"","[1] The punishment for theft."
  12,75,"[The brothers] said, \"Its recompense is that he in whose bag it is found - he [himself] will be its recompense.[1] Thus do we recompense the wrongdoers.\"","[1] According to their law, a convicted thief was made a slave of the one from whom he had stolen."
  12,76,"So he began [the search] with their bags before the bag of his brother; then he extracted it from the bag of his brother. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother within the religion [i.e., law] of the king except that Allāh willed. We raise in degrees whom We will, but over every possessor of knowledge is one [more] knowing.[1]","[1] Ending with the ultimate knowledge of Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā)."
  12,77,"They said, \"If he steals - a brother of his has stolen before.\" But Joseph kept it within himself and did not reveal it to them.[1] He said, \"You are worse in position, and Allāh is most knowing of what you describe.\"","[1] He did not answer that he himself had been stolen by them from his father."
  12,78,"They said, \"O ʿAzeez,[1] indeed he has a father [who is] an old man, so take one of us in place of him. Indeed, we see you as a doer of good.\"","[1] Addressing Joseph, who now held the title of \"al-ʿAzeez.\""
