  3,92,"Never will you attain the good [reward][1] until you spend [in the way of Allāh] from that which you love. And whatever you spend - indeed, Allāh is Knowing of it.","[1] Another meaning is \"You will never attain righteousness.\""
  3,93,"All food was lawful to the Children of Israel except what Israel [i.e., Jacob] had made unlawful to himself before the Torah was revealed. Say, [O Muḥammad], \"So bring the Torah and recite it, if you should be truthful.\"",""

And [due] to Allāh from the people is a pilgrimage to the House - for whoever is able to find thereto a way. But whoever disbelieves [i.e., refuses] - then indeed, Allāh is free from need of the worlds.[1]","[1] He has no need for His servants' worship; it is they who are in need of Him."
