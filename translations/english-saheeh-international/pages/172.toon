quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,164,"And when a community among them said, \"Why do you advise [or warn] a people whom Allāh is [about] to destroy or to punish with a severe punishment?\" they [the advisors] said, \"To be absolved before your Lord and perhaps they may fear Him.\"",""
  7,165,"And when they [i.e., those advised] forgot that by which they had been reminded, We saved those who had forbidden evil and seized those who wronged, with a wretched punishment, because they were defiantly disobeying.",""
  7,166,"So when they were insolent about that which they had been forbidden, We said to them, \"Be apes, despised.\"",""
  7,167,"And [mention] when your Lord declared that He would surely [continue to] send upon them until the Day of Resurrection those who would afflict them with the worst torment. Indeed, your Lord is swift in penalty; but indeed, He is Forgiving and Merciful.",""
  7,168,"And We divided them throughout the earth into nations. Of them some were righteous, and of them some were otherwise. And We tested them with good [times] and bad that perhaps they would return [to obedience].",""
  7,169,"And there followed them successors who inherited the Scripture [while] taking the commodities[1] of this lower life and saying, \"It will be forgiven for us.\" And if an offer like it[2] comes to them, they will [again] take it. Was not the covenant of the Scripture [i.e., the Torah] taken from them that they would not say about Allāh except the truth, and they studied what was in it? And the home of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allāh, so will you not use reason?","[1] i.e., unlawful gains and pleasures.\n[2] i.e., a similar temptation."
  7,170,"But those who hold fast to the Book [i.e., the Qur’ān] and establish prayer - indeed, We will not allow to be lost the reward of the reformers.",""
