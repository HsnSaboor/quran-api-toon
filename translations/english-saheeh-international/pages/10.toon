  2,62,"Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ)] - those [among them] who believed in Allāh and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve[1].","[1] After the coming of Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ) no religion other than Islām is acceptable to Allāh, as stated in 3:85."
  2,63,"And [recall] when We took your covenant, [O Children of Israel, to abide by the Torah] and We raised over you the mount, [saying], \"Take what We have given you with determination and remember what is in it that perhaps you may become righteous.\"",""
  2,64,"Then you turned away after that. And if not for the favor of Allāh upon you and His mercy, you would have been among the losers.",""
  2,65,"And you had already known about those who transgressed among you concerning the sabbath, and We said to them, \"Be apes, despised.\"",""
  2,66,"And We made it a deterrent punishment for those who were present and those who succeeded [them] and a lesson for those who fear Allāh.",""
  2,67,"And [recall] when Moses said to his people, \"Indeed, Allāh commands you to slaughter a cow.\" They said, \"Do you take us in ridicule?\" He said, \"I seek refuge in Allāh from being among the ignorant.\"",""
  2,68,"They said, \"Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is.\" [Moses] said, \"[Allāh] says, 'It is a cow which is neither old nor virgin, but median between that,' so do what you are commanded.\"",""
  2,69,"They said, \"Call upon your Lord to show us what is her color.\" He said, \"He says, 'It is a yellow cow, bright in color - pleasing to the observers.'\"",""
