  2,220,"To this world and the Hereafter. And they ask you about orphans. Say, \"Improvement for them is best. And if you mix your affairs with theirs - they are your brothers. And Allāh knows the corrupter from the amender. And if Allāh had willed, He could have put you in difficulty. Indeed, Allāh is Exalted in Might and Wise.\"",""
  2,221,"And do not marry polytheistic women until they believe.[1] And a believing slave woman is better than a polytheist, even though she might please you. And do not marry polytheistic men [to your women] until they believe. And a believing slave is better than a polytheist, even though he might please you. Those invite [you] to the Fire, but Allāh invites to Paradise and to forgiveness, by His permission. And He makes clear His verses [i.e., ordinances] to the people that perhaps they may remember.","[1] i.e., worship and obey Allāh alone."
  2,222,"And they ask you about menstruation. Say, \"It is harm, so keep away from wives[1] during menstruation. And do not approach them until they are pure. And when they have purified themselves,[2] then come to them from where Allāh has ordained for you. Indeed, Allāh loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves.\"","[1] i.e., refrain from sexual intercourse.\n[2] By taking a complete bath (ghusl) ."
  2,223,"Your wives are a place of cultivation [i.e., sowing of seed] for you, so come to your place of cultivation however you wish and put forth [righteousness] for yourselves. And fear Allāh and know that you will meet Him. And give good tidings to the believers.",""
  2,224,"And do not make [your oath by] Allāh an excuse against being righteous and fearing Allāh and making peace among people. And Allāh is Hearing and Knowing.",""
