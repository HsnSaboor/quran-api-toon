quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,51,"O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allāh guides not the wrongdoing people.",""
  5,52,"So you see those in whose hearts is disease [i.e., hypocrisy] hastening into [association with] them, saying, \"We are afraid a misfortune may strike us.\" But perhaps Allāh will bring conquest or a decision from Him, and they will become, over what they have been concealing within themselves, regretful.",""
  5,53,"And those who believe will say,[1] \"Are these the ones who swore by Allāh their strongest oaths that indeed they were with you?\" Their deeds have become worthless, and they have become losers.","[1] About the hypocrites after their exposure."
  5,54,"O you who have believed, whoever of you should revert from his religion - Allāh will bring forth [in place of them] a people He will love and who will love Him [who are] humble toward the believers, strong against the disbelievers; they strive in the cause of Allāh and do not fear the blame of a critic. That is the favor of Allāh; He bestows it upon whom He wills. And Allāh is all-Encompassing and Knowing.",""
  5,55,"Your ally is none but Allāh and [therefore] His Messenger and those who have believed - those who establish prayer and give zakāh, and they bow [in worship].",""
  5,56,"And whoever is an ally of Allāh and His Messenger and those who have believed - indeed, the party of Allāh - they will be the predominant.",""
  5,57,"O you who have believed, take not those who have taken your religion in ridicule and amusement among the ones who were given the Scripture before you nor the disbelievers as allies. And fear Allāh, if you should [truly] be believers.",""
