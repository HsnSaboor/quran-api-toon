quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,89,"And when there came to them a Book [i.e., the Qur’ān] from Allāh confirming that which was with them - although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved - but [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of Allāh will be upon the disbelievers."
  2,90,"How wretched is that for which they sold themselves - that they would disbelieve in what Allāh has revealed through [their] outrage that Allāh would send down His favor upon whom He wills from among His servants. So they returned having [earned] wrath upon wrath. And for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment."
  2,91,"And when it is said to them, \"Believe in what Allāh has revealed,\" they say, \"We believe [only] in what was revealed to us.\" And they disbelieve in what came after it, while it is the truth confirming that which is with them. Say, \"Then why did you kill the prophets of Allāh before, if you are [indeed] believers?\""
  2,92,"And Moses had certainly brought you clear proofs. Then you took the calf [in worship] after that, while you were wrongdoers."
  2,93,"And [recall] when We took your covenant and raised over you the mount, [saying], \"Take what We have given you with determination and listen.\" They said [instead], \"We hear and disobey.\" And their hearts absorbed [the worship of] the calf because of their disbelief. Say, \"How wretched is that which your faith enjoins upon you, if you should be believers.\""
