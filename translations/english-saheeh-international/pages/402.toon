quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  29,46,"And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, \"We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.\""
  29,47,"And thus We have sent down to you the Book [i.e., the Qur’ān]. And those to whom We [previously] gave the Scripture believe in it. And among these [people of Makkah] are those who believe in it. And none reject Our verses except the disbelievers."
  29,48,"And you did not recite before it any scripture, nor did you inscribe one with your right hand. Then [i.e., otherwise] the falsifiers would have had [cause for] doubt."
  29,49,"Rather, it [i.e., the Qur’ān] is distinct verses [preserved] within the breasts of those who have been given knowledge. And none reject Our verses except the wrongdoers."
  29,50,"But they say, \"Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord?\" Say, \"The signs are only with Allāh, and I am only a clear warner.\""
  29,51,"And is it not sufficient for them that We revealed to you the Book [i.e., the Qur’ān] which is recited to them? Indeed in that is a mercy and reminder for a people who believe."
  29,52,"Say, \"Sufficient is Allāh between me and you as Witness. He knows what is in the heavens and earth. And they who have believed in falsehood and disbelieved in Allāh - it is those who are the losers.\""
