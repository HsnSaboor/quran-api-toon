quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  24,32,"And marry the unmarried among you and the righteous among your male slaves and female slaves. If they should be poor, Allāh will enrich them from His bounty, and Allāh is all-Encompassing and Knowing.",""
  24,33,"But let them who find not [the means for] marriage abstain [from sexual relations] until Allāh enriches them from His bounty. And those who seek a contract [for eventual emancipation] from among whom your right hands possess[1] - then make a contract with them if you know there is within them goodness and give them from the wealth of Allāh which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allāh is [to them], after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful.","[1] i.e., those slaves who desire to purchase their freedom from their owners for a price agreed upon by both."
  24,34,"And We have certainly sent down to you distinct verses[1] and examples from those who passed on before you and an admonition for those who fear Allāh.","[1] i.e., rulings and ordinances, in particular those in this sūrah."
  24,35,"Allāh is the Light[1] of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light[2] is like a niche within which is a lamp;[3] the lamp is within glass, the glass as if it were a pearly [white] star lit from [the oil of] a blessed olive tree, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow even if untouched by fire. Light upon light. Allāh guides to His light whom He wills. And Allāh presents examples for the people, and Allāh is Knowing of all things.","[1] i.e., the source and bestower of light and enlightenment.\n[2] His guidance in the heart of a believing servant.\n[3] Literally, \"a burning wick,\" which is the essence of a lamp."
  24,36,"[Such niches are] in houses [i.e., mosques] which Allāh has ordered to be raised and that His name be mentioned [i.e., praised] therein; exalting Him within them in the morning and the evenings[1]","[1] The term used here can refer to either afternoon or evening."
