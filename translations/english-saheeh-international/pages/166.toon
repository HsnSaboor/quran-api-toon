  7,131,"But when good [i.e., provision] came to them, they said, \"This is ours [by right].\" And if a bad [condition] struck them, they saw an evil omen in Moses and those with him. Unquestionably, their fortune is with Allāh, but most of them do not know.",""
  7,132,"And they said, \"No matter what sign you bring us with which to bewitch us, we will not be believers in you.\"",""
  7,133,"So We sent upon them the flood and locusts and lice and frogs and blood as distinct signs, but they were arrogant and were a criminal people.",""
  7,134,"And when the punishment descended upon them, they said, \"O Moses, invoke for us your Lord by what He has promised you. If you [can] remove the punishment from us, we will surely believe you, and we will send with you the Children of Israel.\"",""
  7,135,"But when We removed the punishment from them until a term which they were to reach,[1] then at once they broke their word.","[1] i.e., a specified term which would end with their reversion to disobedience and disbelief."
  7,136,"So We took retribution from them, and We drowned them in the sea because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them.",""
  7,137,"And We caused the people who had been oppressed to inherit the eastern regions of the land and the western ones, which We had blessed. And the good word [i.e., decree] of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of what they had patiently endured. And We destroyed [all] that Pharaoh and his people were producing and what they had been building.",""
