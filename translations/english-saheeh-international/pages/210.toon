quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  10,15,"And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, those who do not expect the meeting with Us say, \"Bring us a Qur’ān other than this or change it.\" Say, [O Muḥammad], \"It is not for me to change it on my own accord. I only follow what is revealed to me. Indeed I fear, if I should disobey my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day.\"",""
  10,16,"Say, \"If Allāh had willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you, for I had remained among you a lifetime before it.[1] Then will you not reason?\"","[1] The Prophet (ﷺ) lived among his people forty years before receiving any revelation."
  10,17,"So who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about Allāh or denies His signs? Indeed, the criminals will not succeed.",""
  10,18,"And they worship other than Allāh that which neither harms them nor benefits them, and they say, \"These are our intercessors with Allāh.\" Say, \"Do you inform Allāh of something He does not know in the heavens or on the earth?\" Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.",""
  10,19,"And mankind was not but one community [united in religion], but [then] they differed. And if not for a word[1] that preceded from your Lord, it would have been judged between them [immediately] concerning that over which they differ.","[1] Allāh's decree to allow time on earth for His creation or not to punish anyone before evidence has come to him."
  10,20,"And they say, \"Why is a sign not sent down to him from his Lord?\" So say, \"The unseen is only for Allāh [to administer], so wait; indeed, I am with you among those who wait.\"",""
