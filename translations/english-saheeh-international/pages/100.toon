quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,135,"O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for Allāh, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives. Whether one is rich or poor, Allāh is more worthy of both.[1] So follow not [personal] inclination, lest you not be just. And if you distort [your testimony] or refuse [to give it], then indeed Allāh is ever, of what you do, Aware.","[1] i.e., more knowledgeable of their best interests. Therefore, adhere to what He has enjoined upon you and testify honestly."
  4,136,"O you who have believed, believe[1] in Allāh and His Messenger and the Book that He sent down upon His Messenger and the Scripture which He sent down before. And whoever disbelieves in Allāh, His angels, His books, His messengers, and the Last Day has certainly gone far astray.","[1] i.e., renew, confirm and adhere to your belief."
  4,137,"Indeed, those who have believed then disbelieved, then believed then disbelieved, and then increased in disbelief - never will Allāh forgive them, nor will He guide them to a way.",""
  4,138,"Give tidings to the hypocrites that there is for them a painful punishment -",""
  4,139,"Those who take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Do they seek with them honor [through power]? But indeed, honor belongs to Allāh entirely.[1]","[1] Being the source of all power and honor, Allāh grants them to whom He wills."
  4,140,"And it has already come down to you in the Book [i.e., the Qur’ān] that when you hear the verses of Allāh [recited], they are denied [by them] and ridiculed; so do not sit with them until they enter into another conversation. Indeed, you would then be like them.[1] Indeed, Allāh will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers in Hell all together -","[1] In this world, by participation in their blasphemy, and in the next, where you will share their punishment."
