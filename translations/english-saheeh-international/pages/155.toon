quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,38,"[Allāh] will say, \"Enter among nations which had passed on before you of jinn and mankind into the Fire.\" Every time a nation enters, it will curse its sister[1] until, when they have all overtaken one another therein, the last of them[2] will say about the first of them,[3] \"Our Lord, these had misled us, so give them a double punishment of the Fire.\" He will say, \"For each is double, but you do not know.\"","[1] The nation preceding it.\n[2] The followers of evil leaders.\n[3] Their leaders."
  7,39,"And the first of them will say to the last of them, \"Then you had not any favor over us, so taste the punishment for what you used to earn.\"",""
  7,40,"Indeed, those who deny Our verses and are arrogant toward them - the gates of Heaven will not be opened for them, nor will they enter Paradise until a camel enters into the eye of a needle [i.e., never]. And thus do We recompense the criminals.",""
  7,41,"They will have from Hell a bed and over them coverings [of fire]. And thus do We recompense the wrongdoers.",""
  7,42,"But those who believed and did righteous deeds - We charge no soul except [within] its capacity. Those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.",""
  7,43,"And We will have removed whatever is within their breasts of resentment,[1] [while] flowing beneath them are rivers. And they will say, \"Praise to Allāh, who has guided us to this; and we would never have been guided if Allāh had not guided us. Certainly the messengers of our Lord had come with the truth.\" And they will be called, \"This is Paradise, which you have been made to inherit for what you used to do.\"","[1] i.e., ill will or sense of injury for what was inflicted upon them during worldly life."
