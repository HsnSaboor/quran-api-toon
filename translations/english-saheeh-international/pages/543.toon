quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  58,7,"Have you not considered that Allāh knows what is in the heavens and what is on the earth? There are not three in a private conversation but that He is the fourth of them,[1] nor are there five but that He is the sixth of them - and no less than that and no more except that He is with them [in knowledge] wherever they are. Then He will inform them of what they did on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed Allāh is, of all things, Knowing.","[1] Through His knowledge of them and their secrets."
  58,8,"Have you not considered those who were forbidden from private conversation [i.e., ridicule and conspiracy] and then return to that which they were forbidden and converse among themselves about sin and aggression and disobedience to the Messenger? And when they come to you, they greet you with that [word] by which Allāh does not greet you[1] and say among themselves, \"Why does Allāh not punish us for what we say?\" Sufficient for them is Hell, which they will [enter to] burn, and wretched is the destination.","[1] This is in reference to the Jews who would greet the Muslims with the words \"Death be upon you,\" rather than \"Peace.\""
  58,9,"O you who have believed, when you converse privately, do not converse about sin and aggression and disobedience to the Messenger but converse about righteousness and piety. And fear Allāh, to whom you will be gathered.",""
  58,10,"Private conversation is only from Satan that he may grieve those who have believed,[1] but he will not harm them at all except by permission of Allāh. And upon Allāh let the believers rely.","[1] The reference may be to the sinful type of conversation, as mentioned in the previous verses, or to the practice of two persons speaking in confidence in the presence of a third, which might lead him to assume that he is the subject of their conversation. Such behavior was prohibited by the Prophet (ﷺ) in narrations of al-Bukhārī and Muslim."
  58,11,"O you who have believed, when you are told, \"Space yourselves\" in assemblies, then make space; Allāh will make space for you.[1] And when you are told, \"Arise,\"[2] then arise; Allāh will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge, by degrees. And Allāh is Aware of what you do.","[1] In His mercy, in Paradise, or in everything good.\n[2] To prayer, to battle, or to good deeds."
