quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,195,"And their Lord responded to them, \"Never will I allow to be lost the work of [any] worker among you, whether male or female; you are of one another. So those who emigrated or were evicted from their homes or were harmed in My cause or fought or were killed - I will surely remove from them their misdeeds, and I will surely admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow as reward from Allāh, and Allāh has with Him the best reward.\"",""
  3,196,"Be not deceived by the [uninhibited] movement of the disbelievers throughout the land.",""
  3,197,"[It is but] a small enjoyment; then their [final] refuge is Hell, and wretched is the resting place.",""
  3,198,"But those who feared their Lord will have gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding eternally therein, as accommodation from Allāh. And that which is with Allāh is best for the righteous.",""
  3,199,"And indeed, among the People of the Scripture are those who believe in Allāh and what was revealed to you and what was revealed to them, [being] humbly submissive to Allāh. They do not exchange the verses of Allāh for a small price. Those will have their reward with their Lord. Indeed, Allāh is swift in account.",""
  3,200,"O you who have believed, persevere[1] and endure[2] and remain stationed[3] and fear Allāh that you may be successful.","[1] In your religion and in the face of your enemies.\n[2] In patience, outlasting your enemies, and against your own evil inclinations.\n[3] Posted at your positions against the enemy or in the mosques, awaiting prayers."
