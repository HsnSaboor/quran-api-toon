quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  64,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is exalting Allāh.[1] To Him belongs dominion, and to Him belongs [all] praise, and He is over all things competent.","[1] See footnote to 57:1."
  64,2,"It is He who created you, and among you is the disbeliever, and among you is the believer. And Allāh, of what you do, is Seeing.",""
  64,3,"He created the heavens and earth in truth and formed you and perfected your forms; and to Him is the [final] destination.",""
  64,4,"He knows what is within the heavens and earth and knows what you conceal and what you declare. And Allāh is Knowing of that within the breasts.",""
  64,5,"Has there not come to you the news of those who disbelieved before? So they tasted the bad consequence of their affair, and they will have a painful punishment.",""
  64,6,"That is because their messengers used to come to them with clear evidences, but they said, \"Shall human beings guide us?\" and disbelieved and turned away. And Allāh dispensed [with them]; and Allāh is Free of need and Praiseworthy.",""
  64,7,"Those who disbelieve have claimed that they will never be resurrected. Say, \"Yes, by my Lord, you will surely be resurrected; then you will surely be informed of what you did. And that, for Allāh, is easy.\"",""
  64,8,"So believe in Allāh and His Messenger and the light [i.e., the Qur’ān] which We have sent down. And Allāh is Aware of what you do.",""
  64,9,"The Day He will assemble you for the Day of Assembly - that is the Day of Deprivation.[1] And whoever believes in Allāh and does righteousness - He will remove from him his misdeeds and admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment.","[1] \"At-Taghābun\" suggests having been outdone by others in the acquisition of something valued. That Day, the disbelievers will suffer the loss of Paradise to the believers."
