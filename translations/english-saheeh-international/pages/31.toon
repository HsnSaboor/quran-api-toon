quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,197,"Ḥajj is [during] well-known months,[1] so whoever has made ḥajj obligatory upon himself therein [by entering the state of iḥrām], there is [to be for him] no sexual relations and no disobedience and no disputing during ḥajj. And whatever good you do - Allāh knows it. And take provisions, but indeed, the best provision is fear of Allāh. And fear Me, O you of understanding.","[1] See previous footnote."
  2,198,"There is no blame upon you for seeking bounty[1] from your Lord [during ḥajj]. But when you depart from ʿArafāt, remember Allāh at al-Mashʿar al-Ḥarām.[2] And remember Him, as He has guided you, for indeed, you were before that among those astray.","[1] i.e., profit from trade or business.\n[2] Which is in Muzdalifah."
  2,199,"Then depart from the place from where [all] the people depart and ask forgiveness of Allāh. Indeed, Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.",""
  2,200,"And when you have completed your rites, remember Allāh like your [previous] remembrance of your fathers or with [much] greater remembrance. And among the people is he who says, \"Our Lord, give us in this world,\" and he will have in the Hereafter no share.",""
  2,201,"But among them is he who says, \"Our Lord, give us in this world [that which is] good and in the Hereafter [that which is] good and protect us from the punishment of the Fire.\"",""
  2,202,"Those will have a share of what they have earned, and Allāh is swift in account.",""
