quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,18,"But the Jews and the Christians say, \"We are the children of Allāh and His beloved.\" Say, \"Then why does He punish you for your sins?\" Rather, you are human beings from among those He has created. He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. And to Allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, and to Him is the [final] destination.",""
  5,19,"O People of the Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger to make clear to you [the religion] after a period [of suspension] of messengers, lest you say, \"There came not to us any bringer of good tidings or a warner.\" But there has come to you a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And Allāh is over all things competent.",""
  5,20,"And [mention, O Muḥammad], when Moses said to his people, \"O my people, remember the favor of Allāh upon you when He appointed among you prophets and made you possessors[1] and gave you that which He had not given anyone among the worlds.","[1] Of all that you need - specifically, homes, wives and servants. Or \"sovereigns,\" i.e., those of independent authority."
  5,21,"O my people, enter the blessed land [i.e., Palestine] which Allāh has assigned to you and do not turn back [from fighting in Allāh's cause] and [thus] become losers.\"",""
  5,22,"They said, \"O Moses, indeed within it is a people of tyrannical strength, and indeed, we will never enter it until they leave it; but if they leave it, then we will enter.\"",""
  5,23,"Said two men from those who feared [to disobey] upon whom Allāh had bestowed favor, \"Enter upon them through the gate, for when you have entered it, you will be predominant.[1] And upon Allāh rely, if you should be believers.\"","[1] i.e., If you obey the command of Allāh trusting in Him, He will fulfill His promise to you."
