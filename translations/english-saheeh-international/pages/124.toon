quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,96,"Lawful to you is game from the sea and its food as provision for you and the travelers,[1] but forbidden to you is game from the land as long as you are in the state of iḥrām. And fear Allāh to whom you will be gathered.","[1] Fishing and eating whatever is caught from the sea is permitted even during iḥrām."
  5,97,"Allāh has made the Kaʿbah, the Sacred House, standing[1] for the people and [has sanctified] the sacred months and the sacrificial animals and the garlands [by which they are identified]. That is so you may know that Allāh knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and that Allāh is Knowing of all things.","[1] Conspicuously as a symbol of Allāh's religion."
  5,98,"Know that Allāh is severe in penalty and that Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.",""
  5,99,"Not upon the Messenger is [responsibility] except [for] notification. And Allāh knows whatever you reveal and whatever you conceal.",""
  5,100,"Say, \"Not equal are the evil and the good, although the abundance of evil might impress you.\" So fear Allāh, O you of understanding, that you may be successful.",""
  5,101,"O you who have believed, do not ask about things which, if they are shown to you, will distress you. But if you ask about them while the Qur’ān is being revealed, they will be shown to you. Allāh has pardoned it [i.e., that which is past]; and Allāh is Forgiving and Forbearing.",""
  5,102,"A people asked such [questions] before you; then they became thereby disbelievers.[1]","[1] By their unwillingness to carry out what was commanded of them."
  5,103,"Allāh has not appointed [such innovations as] baḥīrah or sā’ibah or waṣīlah or ḥām.[1] But those who disbelieve invent falsehood about Allāh, and most of them do not reason.","[1] Categories of particular camels which were dedicated to the idols and set free to pasture, liberated from the service of man."
