  28,52,"Those to whom We gave the Scripture before it - they[1] are believers in it.","[1] i.e., the sincere believers among them."
  28,53,"And when it is recited to them, they say, \"We have believed in it; indeed, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed we were, [even] before it, Muslims [i.e., submitting to Allāh].\"",""
  28,54,"Those will be given their reward twice for what they patiently endured and [because] they avert evil through good, and from what We have provided them they spend.",""
  28,55,"And when they hear ill speech, they turn away from it and say, \"For us are our deeds, and for you are your deeds. Peace will be upon you;[1] we seek not the ignorant.\"","[1] This is not the Islāmic greeting of \"Peace be upon you.\" Rather, it means \"You are secure from being treated in a like manner by us.\""
  28,56,"Indeed, [O Muḥammad], you do not guide whom you like, but Allāh guides whom He wills. And He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided.",""
  28,57,"And they [i.e., the Quraysh] say, \"If we were to follow the guidance with you, we would be swept[1] from our land.\" Have We not established for them a safe sanctuary to which are brought the fruits of all things as provision from Us?

  28,58,"And how many a city have We destroyed that was insolent in its [way of] living, and those are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them except briefly.[1] And it is We who were the inheritors.","[1] By travelers seeking temporary shelter. The reference is to the ruins which were visible to the Quraysh during their journeys."
  28,59,"And never would your Lord have destroyed the cities until He had sent to their mother [i.e., principal city] a messenger reciting to them Our verses. And We would not destroy the cities except while their people were wrongdoers.",""
