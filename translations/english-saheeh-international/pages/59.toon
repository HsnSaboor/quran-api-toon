quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,71,"O People of the Scripture, why do you mix [i.e., confuse] the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know [it]?",""
  3,72,"And a faction of the People of the Scripture say [to each other], \"Believe in that which was revealed to the believers at the beginning of the day and reject it at its end that perhaps they will return [i.e., abandon their religion],",""
  3,73,"And do not trust except those who follow your religion.\" Say, \"Indeed, the [true] guidance is the guidance of Allāh. [Do you fear] lest someone be given [knowledge] like you were given or that they would [thereby] argue with you before your Lord?\" Say, \"Indeed, [all] bounty is in the hand[1] of Allāh - He grants it to whom He wills. And Allāh is all-Encompassing and Wise.\"","[1] See footnote to 2:19."
  3,74,"He selects for His mercy whom He wills. And Allāh is the possessor of great bounty.",""
  3,75,"And among the People of the Scripture is he who, if you entrust him with a great amount [of wealth], he will return it to you. And among them is he who, if you entrust him with a [single] coin, he will not return it to you unless you are constantly standing over him [demanding it]. That is because they say, \"There is no blame upon us concerning the unlearned.\"[1] And they speak untruth about Allāh while they know [it].","[1] The Jews do not consider it a sin to cheat or lie to a gentile or a pagan."
  3,76,"But yes, whoever fulfills his commitment and fears Allāh - then indeed, Allāh loves those who fear Him.",""
  3,77,"Indeed, those who exchange the covenant of Allāh and their [own] oaths for a small price will have no share in the Hereafter, and Allāh will not speak to them or look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them; and they will have a painful punishment.",""
