quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,144,"[Allāh] said, \"O Moses, I have chosen you over the people with My messages and My words [to you]. So take what I have given you and be among the grateful.\"",""
  7,145,"And We wrote for him on the tablets [something] of all things - instruction and explanation for all things, [saying], \"Take them with determination and order your people to take the best of it. I will show you the home of the defiantly disobedient.\"[1]","[1] This is a severe warning from Allāh against rebellion."
  7,146,"I will turn away from My signs those who are arrogant upon the earth without right; and if they should see every sign, they will not believe in it. And if they see the way of consciousness,[1] they will not adopt it as a way; but if they see the way of error, they will adopt it as a way. That is because they have denied Our signs and they were heedless of them.","[1] i.e., reason and integrity."
  7,147,"Those who denied Our signs and the meeting of the Hereafter - their deeds have become worthless. Are they recompensed except for what they used to do?",""
  7,148,"And the people of Moses made, after [his departure], from their ornaments a calf - an image having a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to a way? They took it [for worship], and they were wrongdoers.",""
  7,149,"And when regret overcame them[1] and they saw that they had gone astray, they said, \"If our Lord does not have mercy upon us and forgive us, we will surely be among the losers.\"","[1] Literally, \"When their hands had been descended upon,\" i.e., bitten by them out of severe regret."
