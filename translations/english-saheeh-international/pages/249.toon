quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  13,1,"Alif, Lām, Meem, Rā.[1] These are the verses of the Book; and what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, but most of the people do not believe.","[1] See footnote to 2:1."
  13,2,"It is Allāh who erected the heavens without pillars that you [can] see; then He established Himself above the Throne[1] and made subject[2] the sun and the moon, each running [its course] for a specified term. He arranges [each] matter; He details the signs that you may, of the meeting with your Lord, be certain.","[1] See footnotes to 2:19 and 7:54.\n[2] For the benefit of mankind."
  13,3,"And it is He who spread the earth and placed therein firmly set mountains and rivers; and from all of the fruits He made therein two mates; He causes the night to cover the day. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.",""
  13,4,"And within the land are neighboring plots and gardens of grapevines and crops and palm trees, [growing] several from a root or otherwise,[1] watered with one water; but We make some of them exceed others in [quality of] fruit. Indeed in that are signs for a people who reason.","[1] i.e., only one from a root."
  13,5,"And if you are astonished,[1] [O Muḥammad] - then astonishing is their saying, \"When we are dust, will we indeed be [brought] into a new creation?\" Those are the ones who have disbelieved in their Lord, and those will have shackles[2] upon their necks, and those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.","[1] At those who deny resurrection.\n[2] Iron collars to which their hands are chained."
