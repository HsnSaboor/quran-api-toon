  4,122,"But the ones who believe and do righteous deeds - We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. [It is] the promise of Allāh, [which is] truth, and who is more truthful than Allāh in statement.",""
  4,123,"It [i.e., Paradise] is not [obtained] by your wishful thinking nor by that of the People of the Scripture. Whoever does a wrong will be recompensed for it, and he will not find besides Allāh a protector or a helper.",""
  4,124,"And whoever does righteous deeds, whether male or female, while being a believer - those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged, [even as much as] the speck on a date seed.",""
  4,125,"And who is better in religion than one who submits himself to Allāh while being a doer of good and follows the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth? And Allāh took Abraham as an intimate friend.",""
  4,126,"And to Allāh belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And ever is Allāh, of all things, encompassing.",""
  4,127,"And they request from you, [O Muḥammad], a [legal] ruling concerning women. Say, \"Allāh gives you a ruling about them and [about] what has been recited to you in the Book concerning the orphan girls to whom you do not give what is decreed for them[1] - and [yet] you desire to marry them - and concerning the oppressed among children and that you maintain for orphans [their rights] in justice.\" And whatever you do of good - indeed, Allāh is ever Knowing of it.","[1] i.e., their rights, in general, and their mahr, specifically."
