  4,46,"Among the Jews are those who distort words from their [proper] places [i.e., usages] and say, \"We hear and disobey\" and \"Hear but be not heard\" and \"Rāʿinā,\"[1] twisting their tongues and defaming the religion. And if they had said [instead], \"We hear and obey\" and \"Wait for us [to understand],\" it would have been better for them and more suitable. But Allāh has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not, except for a few.[2]","[1] See footnote to 2:104.\n[2] Or \"except with little belief.\""
  4,47,"O you who were given the Scripture, believe in what We have sent down [to Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ)], confirming that which is with you, before We obliterate faces and turn them toward their backs or curse them as We cursed the sabbath-breakers.[1] And ever is the matter [i.e., decree] of Allāh accomplished.","[1] See 7:163-166."
