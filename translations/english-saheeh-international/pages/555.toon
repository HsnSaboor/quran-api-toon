quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"And when it is said to them, \"Come, the Messenger of Allāh will ask forgiveness for you,\" they turn their heads aside and you see them evading while they are arrogant."
  63,6,"It is all the same for them whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them; never will Allāh forgive them. Indeed, Allāh does not guide the defiantly disobedient people."
  63,7,"They are the ones who say, \"Do not spend on those who are with the Messenger of Allāh until they disband.\" And to Allāh belong the depositories of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not understand."
  63,8,"They say, \"If we return to al-Madīnah, the more honored [for power] will surely expel therefrom the more humble.\" And to Allāh belongs [all] honor, and to His Messenger, and to the believers, but the hypocrites do not know."
  63,9,"O you who have believed, let not your wealth and your children divert you from the remembrance of Allāh. And whoever does that - then those are the losers."
  63,10,"And spend [in the way of Allāh] from what We have provided you before death approaches one of you and he says, \"My Lord, if only You would delay me for a brief term so I would give charity and be of the righteous.\""
  63,11,"But never will Allāh delay a soul when its time has come. And Allāh is Aware of what you do."
