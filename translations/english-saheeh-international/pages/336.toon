quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  22,31,"Inclining [only] to Allāh, not associating [anything] with Him. And he who associates with Allāh - it is as though he had fallen from the sky and was snatched by the birds or the wind carried him down into a remote place.",""
  22,32,"That [is so]. And whoever honors the symbols [i.e., rites] of Allāh - indeed, it is from the piety of hearts.",""
  22,33,"For you therein [i.e., the animals marked for sacrifice] are benefits for a specified term;[1] then their place of sacrifice is at the ancient House.[2]","[1] i.e., they may be milked or ridden (in the case of camels) before the time of slaughter.\n[2] i.e., within the boundaries of the Ḥaram, which includes Minā."
  22,34,"And for every [religious] community We have appointed a rite [of sacrifice][1] that they may mention the name of Allāh over what He has provided for them of [sacrificial] animals. For your god is one God, so to Him submit. And, [O Muḥammad], give good tidings to the humble [before their Lord]","[1] i.e., the rite of sacrifice has always been a part of Allāh's revealed religion."
  22,35,"Who, when Allāh is mentioned, their hearts are fearful, and [to] the patient over what has afflicted them, and the establishers of prayer and those who spend from what We have provided them.",""
  22,36,"And the camels and cattle We have appointed for you as among the symbols [i.e., rites] of Allāh; for you therein is good. So mention the name of Allāh upon them when lined up [for sacrifice]; and when they are [lifeless] on their sides, then eat from them and feed the needy [who does not seek aid] and the beggar. Thus have We subjected them to you that you may be grateful.",""
  22,37,"Their meat will not reach Allāh, nor will their blood, but what reaches Him is piety from you. Thus have We subjected them to you that you may glorify Allāh for that [to] which He has guided you; and give good tidings to the doers of good.",""
  22,38,"Indeed, Allāh defends those who have believed. Indeed, Allāh does not like everyone treacherous and ungrateful.",""
