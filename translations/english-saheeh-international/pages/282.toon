Indeed, He is the Hearing,[3] the Seeing.[4]","[1] Above any imperfection or failure to do as He wills.\n[2] In Jerusalem.\n[3] Who hears every sound, distinguishes every voice, understands every word, and accepts and responds to supplications.\n[4] Who sees and understands all things apparent and unapparent, visible and invisible."
