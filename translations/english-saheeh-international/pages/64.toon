quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,109,"To Allāh belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And to Allāh will [all] matters be returned.",""
  3,110,"You are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allāh. If only the People of the Scripture had believed, it would have been better for them. Among them are believers, but most of them are defiantly disobedient.",""
  3,111,"They will not harm you except for [some] annoyance. And if they fight you, they will show you their backs [i.e., retreat]; then they will not be aided.",""
  3,112,"They have been put under humiliation [by Allāh] wherever they are overtaken, except for a rope [i.e., covenant] from Allāh and a rope [i.e., treaty] from the people [i.e., the Muslims].[1] And they have drawn upon themselves anger from Allāh and have been put under destitution. That is because they disbelieved in [i.e., rejected] the verses of Allāh and killed the prophets without right. That is because they disobeyed and [habitually] transgressed.","[1] Once they have surrendered, the People of the Scripture retain their rights and honor (in spite of their refusal of Islām) through payment of the jizyah tax in place of zakāh and military service due from Muslims. They are then under the protection of the Islāmic state."
  3,113,"They are not [all] the same; among the People of the Scripture is a community[1] standing [in obedience], reciting the verses of Allāh during periods of the night and prostrating [in prayer].","[1] Of people who accepted Islām."
  3,114,"They believe in Allāh and the Last Day, and they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and hasten to good deeds. And those are among the righteous.",""
  3,115,"And whatever good they do - never will it be denied them. And Allāh is Knowing of the righteous.",""
