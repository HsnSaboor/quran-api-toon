quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  42,16,"And those who argue concerning Allāh after He has been responded to[1] - their argument is invalid with their Lord, and upon them is [His] wrath, and for them is a severe punishment.","[1] i.e., after people have accepted the truth from Allāh, in an attempt to turn the believers away from His religion of Islām."
  42,17,"It is Allāh who has sent down the Book in truth and [also] the balance [i.e., justice]. And what will make you perceive? Perhaps the Hour is near.",""
  42,18,"Those who do not believe in it are impatient for it,[1] but those who believe are fearful of it and know that it is the truth. Unquestionably, those who dispute concerning the Hour are in extreme error.","[1] They had challenged the Prophet (ﷺ) to bring it on immediately."
  42,19,"Allāh is Subtle[1] with His servants; He gives provision to whom He wills. And He is the Powerful, the Exalted in Might.","[1] See footnote in 12:100."
  42,20,"Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter - We increase for him in his harvest [i.e., reward]. And whoever desires the harvest [i.e., benefits] of this world - We give him thereof, but there is not for him in the Hereafter any share.",""
  42,21,"Or have they partners [i.e., other deities] who have ordained for them a religion to which Allāh has not consented? But if not for the decisive word,[1] it would have been concluded between them. And indeed, the wrongdoers will have a painful punishment.","[1] Decree. See footnote to 10:19."
  42,22,"You will see the wrongdoers fearful of what they have earned, and it will [certainly] befall them. And those who have believed and done righteous deeds will be in lush regions of the gardens [in Paradise] having whatever they will in the presence of their Lord. That is what is the great bounty.",""
