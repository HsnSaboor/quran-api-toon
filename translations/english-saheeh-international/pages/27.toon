quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,177,"Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in Allāh, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets and gives wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives zakāh; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous.",""
  2,178,"O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution for those murdered - the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.[1] But whoever overlooks from his brother [i.e., the killer] anything,[2] then there should be a suitable follow-up and payment to him [i.e., the deceased's heir or legal representative] with good conduct. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. But whoever transgresses after that[3] will have a painful punishment.","[1] No one else should be executed in place of the killer.\n[2] By accepting compensation payment rather than execution.\n[3] After acceptance of compensation."
  2,179,"And there is for you in legal retribution [saving of] life, O you [people] of understanding, that you may become righteous.[1]","[1] Or, \"that you may avoid [sin].\""
  2,180,"Prescribed for you when death approaches [any] one of you if he leaves wealth [is that he should make] a bequest for the parents and near relatives according to what is acceptable - a duty upon the righteous.[1]","[1] This ruling was abrogated by the revelation in Sūrah an-Nisā’ stipulating obligatory shares for parents and close relatives. Those who do not inherit by law may be remembered in a bequest. See 4:11-12."
  2,181,"Then whoever alters it [i.e., the bequest] after he has heard it - the sin is only upon those who have altered it. Indeed, Allāh is Hearing and Knowing.",""
