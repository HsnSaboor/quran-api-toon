quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  35,12,"And not alike are the two seas [i.e., bodies of water]. One is fresh and sweet, palatable for drinking, and one is salty and bitter. And from each you eat tender meat and extract ornaments which you wear, and you see the ships plowing through [them] that you might seek of His bounty; and perhaps you will be grateful.",""
  35,13,"He causes the night to enter the day, and He causes the day to enter the night and has subjected the sun and the moon - each running [its course] for a specified term. That is Allāh, your Lord; to Him belongs sovereignty. And those whom you invoke other than Him do not possess [as much as] the membrane of a date seed.",""
  35,14,"If you invoke them, they do not hear your supplication; and if they heard, they would not respond to you. And on the Day of Resurrection they will deny your association.[1] And none can inform you like [one] Aware [of all matters].","[1] Of them with Allāh or your worship of them."
  35,15,"O mankind, you are those in need of Allāh, while Allāh is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.",""
  35,16,"If He wills, He can do away with you and bring forth a new creation.",""
  35,17,"And that is for Allāh not difficult.",""
  35,18,"And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. And if a heavily laden soul calls [another] to [carry some of] its load, nothing of it will be carried, even if he should be a close relative. You can only warn those who fear their Lord unseen and have established prayer. And whoever purifies himself only purifies himself for [the benefit of] his soul. And to Allāh is the [final] destination.",""
