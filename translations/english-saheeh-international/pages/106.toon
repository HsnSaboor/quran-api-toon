quran[3]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,176,"They request from you a [legal] ruling. Say, \"Allāh gives you a ruling concerning one having neither descendants nor ascendants [as heirs].\" If a man dies, leaving no child but [only] a sister, she will have half of what he left. And he inherits from her if she [dies and] has no child. But if there are two sisters [or more], they will have two thirds of what he left. If there are both brothers and sisters, the male will have the share of two females.[1] Allāh makes clear to you [His law], lest you go astray. And Allāh is Knowing of all things.","[1] This verse relates to siblings from the father's side or from both parents, whereas in Āyah 12 it concerned those from the mother's side alone."
  5,1,"O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts.[1] Lawful for you are the animals of grazing livestock except for that which is recited to you [in this Qur’ān] - hunting not being permitted while you are in the state of iḥrām.[2] Indeed, Allāh ordains what He intends.","[1] Which includes promises, covenants, oaths, etc.\n[2] The state of ritual consecration for ḥajj or ʿumrah."
  5,2,"O you who have believed, do not violate the rites of Allāh or [the sanctity of] the sacred month or [neglect the marking of] the sacrificial animals and garlanding [them] or [violate the safety of] those coming to the Sacred House seeking bounty from their Lord and [His] approval. But when you come out of iḥrām, then [you may] hunt. And do not let the hatred of a people for having obstructed you from al-Masjid al-Ḥarām lead you to transgress. And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression. And fear Allāh; indeed, Allāh is severe in penalty.",""
