quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  58,22,"You will not find a people who believe in Allāh and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allāh and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred. Those - He has decreed within their hearts faith and supported them with spirit[1] from Him. And We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. Allāh is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him - those are the party of Allāh. Unquestionably, the party of Allāh - they are the successful.","[1] i.e., \"that which gives life,\" explained as the guidance of the Qur’ān or victory over their opponents."
  59,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth exalts Allāh,[1] and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.","[1] See footnote to 57:1."
  59,2,"It is He who expelled the ones who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture[1] from their homes at the first gathering.[2] You did not think they would leave, and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from Allāh; but [the decree of] Allāh came upon them from where they had not expected, and He cast terror into their hearts [so] they destroyed their houses by their [own] hands and the hands of the believers. So take warning, O people of vision.","[1] Referring to the Jews of Banun-Naḍeer, who broke their pact with the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ).\n[2] This was the first tme they had ever been gathered and expelled."
  59,3,"And if not that Allāh had decreed for them evacuation, He would have punished them in [this] world, and for them in the Hereafter is the punishment of the Fire.",""
