  13,43,"And those who have disbelieved say, \"You are not a messenger.\" Say, [O Muḥammad], \"Sufficient is Allāh as Witness between me and you, and [the witness of] whoever has knowledge of the Scripture.\"[1]","[1] i.e., those who recognize the truth through their knowledge of previous scriptures."
  14,1,"Alif, Lām, Rā.[1] [This is] a Book which We have revealed to you, [O Muḥammad], that you might bring mankind out of darknesses into the light by permission of their Lord - to the path of the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy -","[1] See footnote to 2:1."
  14,2,"Allāh, to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And woe [i.e., destruction] to the disbelievers from a severe punishment -",""
  14,3,"The ones who prefer the worldly life over the Hereafter and avert [people] from the way of Allāh, seeking to make it [seem] deviant. Those are in extreme error.",""
  14,4,"And We did not send any messenger except [speaking] in the language of his people to state clearly for them, and Allāh sends astray [thereby] whom He wills[1] and guides whom He wills. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.","[1] i.e., those who refuse His guidance."
  14,5,"And We certainly sent Moses with Our signs, [saying], \"Bring out your people from darknesses into the light and remind them of the days[1] of Allāh.\" Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful.","[1] Days of blessings bestowed upon the Children of Israel. Also interpreted as days of punishment and destruction of the former nations."
