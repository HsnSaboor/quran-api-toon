quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,83,"And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they have recognized of the truth. They say, \"Our Lord, we have believed, so register us among the witnesses.",""
  5,84,"And why should we not believe in Allāh and what has come to us of the truth? And we aspire that our Lord will admit us [to Paradise] with the righteous people.\"",""
  5,85,"So Allāh rewarded them for what they said[1] with gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. And that is the reward of doers of good.","[1] i.e., their admission and acceptance of the truth and commitment to Allāh's religion (Islām)."
  5,86,"But those who disbelieved and denied Our signs - they are the companions of Hellfire.",""
  5,87,"O you who have believed, do not prohibit the good things which Allāh has made lawful to you and do not transgress. Indeed, Allāh does not like transgressors.",""
  5,88,"And eat of what Allāh has provided for you [which is] lawful and good. And fear Allāh, in whom you are believers.",""
  5,89,"Allāh will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless[1] in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for [breaking] what you intended of oaths. So its expiation[2] is the feeding of ten needy people from the average of that which you feed your [own] families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave. But whoever cannot find [or afford it] - then a fast of three days [is required]. That is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn. But guard your oaths.[3] Thus does Allāh make clear to you His verses [i.e., revealed law] that you may be grateful.","[1] i.e., what is sworn to only out of habit of speech or what one utters carelessly without true intent.\n[2] i.e., that for a deliberate oath.\n[3] i.e., do not take oaths indiscriminately or swear to do that which is sinful, requiring expiation."
