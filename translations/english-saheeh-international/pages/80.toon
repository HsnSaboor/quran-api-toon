quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,15,"Those who commit immorality [i.e., unlawful sexual intercourse] of your women - bring against them four [witnesses] from among you. And if they testify,[1] confine them [i.e., the guilty women] to houses until death takes them or Allāh ordains for them [another] way.[2]","[1] The witnesses must swear to actually having seen the act taking place.\n[2] The \"other way\" (i.e., penalty) was later revealed in 24:2, canceling the ruling in this verse."
  4,16,"And the two[1] who commit it [i.e., unlawful sexual intercourse] among you - punish [i.e., dishonor] them both. But if they repent and correct themselves, leave them alone. Indeed, Allāh is ever Accepting of Repentance and Merciful.","[1] Scholars differ over whether \"the two\" refers to two of the same sex (i.e., homosexuals) or those of opposite sexes. In either case, later rulings outlined in the sunnah have replaced this one."
  4,17,"The repentance accepted by Allāh is only for those who do wrong in ignorance [or carelessness] and then repent soon [after].[1] It is those to whom Allāh will turn in forgiveness, and Allāh is ever Knowing and Wise.","[1] Scholars have also interpreted \"soon\" to mean before death."
  4,18,"But repentance is not [accepted] of those who [continue to] do evil deeds up until, when death comes to one of them, he says, \"Indeed, I have repented now,\" or of those who die while they are disbelievers. For them We have prepared a painful punishment.",""
  4,19,"O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion.[1] And do not make difficulties for them in order to take [back] part of what you gave them[2] unless they commit a clear immorality [i.e., adultery]. And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them - perhaps you dislike a thing and Allāh makes therein much good.","[1] The deceased man's heirs have no rights of marriage or otherwise over his widow.\n[2] At the time of marriage as mahr."
