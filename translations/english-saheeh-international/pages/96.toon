quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,106,"And seek forgiveness of Allāh. Indeed, Allāh is ever Forgiving and Merciful."
  4,107,"And do not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Indeed, Allāh loves not one who is a habitually sinful deceiver."
  4,108,"They conceal [their evil intentions and deeds] from the people, but they cannot conceal [them] from Allāh, and He is with them [in His knowledge] when they spend the night in such as He does not accept of speech. And ever is Allāh, of what they do, encompassing."
  4,109,"Here you are - those who argue on their behalf in [this] worldly life - but who will argue with Allāh for them on the Day of Resurrection, or who will [then] be their representative?"
  4,110,"And whoever does a wrong or wrongs himself but then seeks forgiveness of Allāh will find Allāh Forgiving and Merciful."
  4,111,"And whoever earns [i.e., commits] a sin only earns it against himself. And Allāh is ever Knowing and Wise."
  4,112,"But whoever earns an offense or a sin and then blames it on an innocent [person] has taken upon himself a slander and manifest sin."
  4,113,"And if it was not for the favor of Allāh upon you, [O Muḥammad], and His mercy, a group of them would have determined to mislead you. But they do not mislead except themselves, and they will not harm you at all. And Allāh has revealed to you the Book and wisdom and has taught you that which you did not know. And ever has the favor of Allāh upon you been great."
