quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,31,"O children of Adam, take your adornment [i.e., wear your clothing] at every masjid,[1] and eat and drink, but be not excessive. Indeed, He likes not those who commit excess.","[1] Literally, \"place of prostration,\" meaning any place that a Muslim prays upon the earth. The term may also refer specifically to a mosque."
  7,32,"Say, \"Who has forbidden the adornment of [i.e., from] Allāh which He has produced for His servants and the good [lawful] things of provision?\" Say, \"They are for those who believed during the life of this world, exclusively [for them] on the Day of Resurrection.\" Thus do We detail the verses for a people who know.",""
  7,33,"Say, \"My Lord has only forbidden immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed - and sin,[1] and oppression without right, and that you associate with Allāh that for which He has not sent down authority, and that you say about Allāh that which you do not know.\"","[1] Any unlawful deed."
  7,34,"And for every nation is a [specified] term. So when their time has come, they will not remain behind an hour, nor will they precede [it].",""
  7,35,"O children of Adam, if there come to you messengers from among you relating to you My verses [i.e., scriptures and laws], then whoever fears Allāh and reforms - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.",""
  7,36,"But the ones who deny Our verses and are arrogant toward them - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.",""
  7,37,"And who is more unjust than one who invents about Allāh a lie or denies His verses? Those will attain their portion of the decree[1] until, when Our messengers [i.e., angels] come to them to take them in death, they will say, \"Where are those you used to invoke besides Allāh?\" They will say, \"They have departed from us,\" and will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers.","[1] What is decreed for them."
