quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,158,"Do they [then] wait for anything except that the angels should come to them or your Lord should come or that there come some of the signs[1] of your Lord? The Day that some of the signs of your Lord will come no soul will benefit from its faith as long as it had not believed before or had earned through its faith some good. Say, \"Wait. Indeed, we [also] are waiting.\"","[1] Those denoting the approach of the Last Hour."
  6,159,"Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become sects - you, [O Muḥammad], are not [associated] with them in anything. Their affair is only [left] to Allāh; then He will inform them about what they used to do.",""
  6,160,"Whoever comes [on the Day of Judgement] with a good deed will have ten times the like thereof [to his credit], and whoever comes with an evil deed will not be recompensed except the like thereof; and they will not be wronged.[1]","[1] i.e., treated unjustly."
  6,161,"Say, \"Indeed, my Lord has guided me to a straight path - a correct religion - the way of Abraham, inclining toward truth. And he was not among those who associated others with Allāh.\"",""
  6,162,"Say, \"Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allāh, Lord of the worlds.",""
  6,163,"No partner has He. And this I have been commanded, and I am the first [among you] of the Muslims.\"[1]","[1] i.e., those who submit to the will of Allāh."
  6,164,"Say, \"Is it other than Allāh I should desire as a lord while He is the Lord of all things? And every soul earns not [blame] except against itself, and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.\"",""
  6,165,"And it is He who has made you successors upon the earth and has raised some of you above others in degrees [of rank] that He may try you through what He has given you. Indeed, your Lord is swift in penalty; but indeed, He is Forgiving and Merciful.",""
