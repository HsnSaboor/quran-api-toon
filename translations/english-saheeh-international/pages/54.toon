quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,30,"The Day every soul will find what it has done of good present [before it] and what it has done of evil, it will wish that between itself and that [evil] was a great distance. And Allāh warns you of Himself, and Allāh is Kind to [His] servants.\""
  3,31,"Say, [O Muḥammad], \"If you should love Allāh, then follow me, [so] Allāh will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.\""
  3,32,"Say, \"Obey Allāh and the Messenger. But if you turn away - then indeed, Allāh does not like the disbelievers.\""
  3,33,"Indeed, Allāh chose Adam and Noah and the family of Abraham and the family of ʿImrān over the worlds -"
  3,34,"Descendants, some of them from others. And Allāh is Hearing and Knowing."
  3,35,"[Mention, O Muḥammad], when the wife of ʿImrān said, \"My Lord, indeed I have pledged to You what is in my womb, consecrated [for Your service], so accept this from me. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing.\""
  3,36,"But when she delivered her, she said, \"My Lord, I have delivered a female.\" And Allāh was most knowing of what she delivered, and the male is not like the female. \"And I have named her Mary, and I seek refuge for her in You and [for] her descendants from Satan, the expelled [from the mercy of Allāh].\""
  3,37,"So her Lord accepted her with good acceptance and caused her to grow in a good manner and put her in the care of Zechariah. Every time Zechariah entered upon her in the prayer chamber, he found with her provision. He said, \"O Mary, from where is this [coming] to you?\" She said, \"It is from Allāh. Indeed, Allāh provides for whom He wills without account.\""
