quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  59,10,"And [there is a share for] those who come after them, saying, \"Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith and put not in our hearts [any] resentment toward those who have believed. Our Lord, indeed You are Kind and Merciful.\""
  59,11,"Have you not considered those who practice hypocrisy, saying to their brothers [i.e., associates] who have disbelieved among the People of the Scripture, \"If you are expelled, we will surely leave with you, and we will not obey, in regard to you, anyone - ever; and if you are fought, we will surely aid you.\" But Allāh testifies that they are liars."
  59,12,"If they are expelled, they will not leave with them, and if they are fought, they will not aid them. And [even] if they should aid them, they will surely turn their backs; then [thereafter] they will not be aided."
  59,13,"You [believers] are more fearful within their breasts than Allāh. That is because they are a people who do not understand."
  59,14,"They will not fight you all except within fortified cities or from behind walls. Their violence [i.e., enmity] among themselves is severe. You think they are together, but their hearts are diverse. That is because they are a people who do not reason."
  59,15,"[Theirs is] like the example of those shortly before them: they tasted the bad consequence of their affair, and they will have a painful punishment."
  59,16,"[The hypocrites are] like the example of Satan when he says to man, \"Disbelieve.\" But when he disbelieves, he says, \"Indeed, I am disassociated from you. Indeed, I fear Allāh, Lord of the worlds.\""
