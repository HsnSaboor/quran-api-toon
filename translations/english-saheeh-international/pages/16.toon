quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,102,"And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Hārūt and Mārūt. But they [i.e., the two angels] do not teach anyone unless they say, \"We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic].\"[1] And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allāh. And they [i.e., people] learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But they [i.e., the Children of Israel] certainly knew that whoever purchased it [i.e., magic] would not have in the Hereafter any share. And wretched is that for which they sold themselves, if they only knew.","[1] They warn people against the misuse of what they have learned."
  2,103,"And if they had believed and feared Allāh, then the reward from Allāh would have been [far] better, if they only knew.",""
  2,104,"O you who have believed, say not [to Allāh's Messenger], \"Rāʿinā\" but say, \"Unẓurnā\"[1] and listen. And for the disbelievers is a painful punishment.","[1] The word \"rāʿinā\" in Arabic literally means \"consider us,\" i.e., give us time to hear you and listen to us. The Jews used to use the same word with the meaning of an insult. Therefore, the believers were ordered to avoid this expression and use instead the word \"unẓurnā,\" i.e., \"wait for us [so that we may understand].\""
  2,105,"Neither those who disbelieve from the People of the Scripture [i.e., the Jews and Christians] nor the polytheists wish that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord. But Allāh selects for His mercy whom He wills, and Allāh is the possessor of great bounty.",""
