quran[3]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,257,"Allāh is the Ally[1] of those who believe. He brings them out from darknesses into the light. And those who disbelieve - their allies are ṭāghūt. They take them out of the light into darknesses.[2] Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide eternally therein.","[1] Including the meanings of patron, supporter, benefactor, guardian, protector, defender and caretaker.\n[2] The light of truth is one, while the darknesses of disbelief, doubt and error are many."
  2,258,"Have you not considered the one who argued with Abraham about his Lord [merely] because Allāh had given him kingship? When Abraham said, \"My Lord is the one who gives life and causes death,\" he said, \"I give life and cause death.\" Abraham said, \"Indeed, Allāh brings up the sun from the east, so bring it up from the west.\" So the disbeliever was overwhelmed [by astonishment], and Allāh does not guide the wrongdoing people.",""
  2,259,"Or [consider such an example] as the one who passed by a township which had fallen into ruin. He said, \"How will Allāh bring this to life after its death?\" So Allāh caused him to die for a hundred years; then He revived him. He said, \"How long have you remained?\" He [the man] said, \"I have remained a day or part of a day.\" He said, \"Rather, you have remained one hundred years. Look at your food and your drink; it has not changed with time. And look at your donkey; and We will make you a sign for the people. And look at the bones [of this donkey] - how We raise them and then We cover them with flesh.\" And when it became clear to him, he said, \"I know that Allāh is over all things competent.\"",""
