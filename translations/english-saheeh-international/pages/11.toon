quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,70,"They said, \"Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is. Indeed, [all] cows look alike to us. And indeed we, if Allāh wills, will be guided.\"",""
  2,71,"He said, \"He says, 'It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field, one free from fault with no spot upon her.'\" They said, \"Now you have come with the truth.\" So they slaughtered her, but they could hardly do it.",""
  2,72,"And [recall] when you slew a man and disputed[1] over it, but Allāh was to bring out that which you were concealing.","[1] i.e., exchanged accusations and denials."
  2,73,"So We said, \"Strike him [i.e., the slain man] with part of it.\"[1] Thus does Allāh bring the dead to life, and He shows you His signs that you might reason.","[1] i.e., the cow. Thereupon, Allāh restored life to the man, who informed them of his murderer."
  2,74,"Then your hearts became hardened after that, being like stones or even harder. For indeed, there are stones from which rivers burst forth, and there are some of them that split open and water comes out, and there are some of them that fall down for fear of Allāh. And Allāh is not unaware of what you do.",""
  2,75,"Do you covet [the hope, O believers], that they would believe for you while a party of them used to hear the words of Allāh and then distort it [i.e., the Torah] after they had understood it while they were knowing?",""
  2,76,"And when they meet those who believe, they say, \"We have believed\"; but when they are alone with one another, they say, \"Do you talk to them about what Allāh has revealed to you so they can argue with you about it before your Lord?\" Then will you not reason?",""
