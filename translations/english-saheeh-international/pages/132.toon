quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,36,"Only those who hear will respond. But the dead[1] - Allāh will resurrect them; then to Him they will be returned.","[1] i.e., the dead of heart, meaning the disbelievers."
  6,37,"And they say, \"Why has a sign not been sent down to him from his Lord?\" Say, \"Indeed, Allāh is Able to send down a sign, but most of them do not know.\"",""
  6,38,"And there is no creature on [or within] the earth or bird that flies with its wings except [that they are] communities like you. We have not neglected in the Register[1] a thing. Then unto their Lord they will be gathered.","[1] The Preserved Slate (al-Lawḥ al-Maḥfūẓ), in which all things are recorded."
  6,39,"But those who deny Our verses are deaf and dumb within darknesses. Whomever Allāh wills - He sends astray; and whomever He wills - He puts him on a straight path.",""
  6,40,"Say, \"Have you considered:[1] if there came to you the punishment of Allāh or there came to you the Hour - is it other than Allāh you would invoke, if you should be truthful?\"","[1] The meaning is understood to be \"Tell me...\""
  6,41,"No, it is Him [alone] you would invoke, and He would remove that for which you invoked Him if He willed, and you would forget what you associate [with Him].",""
  6,42,"And We have already sent [messengers] to nations before you, [O Muḥammad]; then We seized them with poverty and hardship that perhaps they might humble themselves [to Us].",""
  6,43,"Then why, when Our punishment came to them, did they not humble themselves? But their hearts became hardened, and Satan made attractive to them that which they were doing.",""
  6,44,"So when they forgot that by which they had been reminded,[1] We opened to them the doors of every [good] thing until, when they rejoiced in that which they were given, We seized them suddenly, and they were [then] in despair.","[1] i.e., their trial by poverty and hardship or the warnings of their prophets."
