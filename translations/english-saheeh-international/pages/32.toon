quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,203,"And remember Allāh during [specific] numbered days. Then whoever hastens [his departure] in two days - there is no sin upon him; and whoever delays [until the third] - there is no sin upon him - for him who fears Allāh. And fear Allāh and know that unto Him you will be gathered."
  2,204,"And of the people is he whose speech pleases you in worldly life, and he calls Allāh to witness as to what is in his heart, yet he is the fiercest of opponents."
  2,205,"And when he goes away, he strives throughout the land to cause corruption therein and destroy crops and animals. And Allāh does not like corruption."
  2,206,"And when it is said to him, \"Fear Allāh,\" pride in the sin takes hold of him. Sufficient for him is Hellfire, and how wretched is the resting place."
  2,207,"And of the people is he who sells himself, seeking means to the approval of Allāh. And Allāh is Kind to [His] servants."
  2,208,"O you who have believed, enter into Islām completely [and perfectly] and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy."
  2,209,"But if you slip [i.e., deviate] after clear proofs have come to you, then know that Allāh is Exalted in Might and Wise."
  2,210,"Do they await but that Allāh should come to them in covers of clouds and the angels [as well] and the matter is [then] decided? And to Allāh [all] matters are returned."
