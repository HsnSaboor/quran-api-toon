quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  48,29,"Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allāh; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking bounty from Allāh and [His] pleasure. Their sign is in their faces from the effect of prostration [i.e., prayer]. That is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers - so that He [i.e., Allāh] may enrage by them[1] the disbelievers. Allāh has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward.","[1] The given examples depict the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions."
  49,1,"O you who have believed, do not put [yourselves] before Allāh and His Messenger[1] but fear Allāh. Indeed, Allāh is Hearing and Knowing.","[1] Rather, wait for instruction and follow the way of the Prophet (ﷺ)."
  49,2,"O you who have believed, do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet or be loud to him in speech like the loudness of some of you to others, lest your deeds become worthless while you perceive not.",""
  49,3,"Indeed, those who lower their voices before the Messenger of Allāh - they are the ones whose hearts Allāh has tested for righteousness. For them is forgiveness and great reward.",""
  49,4,"Indeed, those who call you, [O Muḥammad], from behind the chambers - most of them do not use reason.",""
