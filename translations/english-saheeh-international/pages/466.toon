quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  39,68,"And the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom Allāh wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on.",""
  39,69,"And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord, and the record [of deeds] will be placed, and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought, and it will be judged between them in truth, and they will not be wronged.",""
  39,70,"And every soul will be fully compensated [for] what it did; and He is most knowing[1] of what they do.","[1] With no need for any record or witnesses, which are but means to establish proof to the soul itself in addition to its own knowledge of what it has done."
  39,71,"And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups until, when they reach it, its gates are opened and its keepers will say, \"Did there not come to you messengers from yourselves, reciting to you the verses of your Lord and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?\" They will say, \"Yes, but the word [i.e., decree] of punishment has come into effect upon the disbelievers.\"",""
  39,72,"[To them] it will be said, \"Enter the gates of Hell to abide eternally therein, and wretched is the residence of the arrogant.\"",""
  39,73,"But those who feared their Lord will be driven to Paradise in groups until, when they reach it while its gates have been opened and its keepers say, \"Peace be upon you; you have become pure; so enter it to abide eternally therein,\" [they will enter].[1]","[1] In such honor and joy that is beyond description - thus, the omission of this conclusion in the Arabic text."
  39,74,"And they will say, \"Praise to Allāh, who has fulfilled for us His promise and made us inherit the earth [so] we may settle in Paradise wherever we will. And excellent is the reward of [righteous] workers.\"",""
