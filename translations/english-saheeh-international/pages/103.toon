quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,155,"And [We cursed them][1] for their breaking of the covenant and their disbelief in the signs of Allāh and their killing of the prophets without right and their saying, \"Our hearts are wrapped\" [i.e., sealed against reception]. Rather, Allāh has sealed them because of their disbelief, so they believe not, except for a few.[2]","[1] Another interpretation is \"And [We made certain good foods unlawful to them],\" based upon verse 160.\n[2] Or \"except with little belief.\""
  4,156,"And [We cursed them] for their disbelief and their saying against Mary a great slander[1]","[1] When they accused her of fornication."
  4,157,"And [for] their saying, \"Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, the messenger of Allāh.\" And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain.[1]","[1] Another meaning is \"And they did not kill him, being certain [of his identity],\" i.e., they killed another assuming it was Jesus (upon whom be peace)."
  4,158,"Rather, Allāh raised him to Himself. And ever is Allāh Exalted in Might and Wise.",""
  4,159,"And there is none from the People of the Scripture but that he will surely believe in him [i.e., Jesus] before his death.[1] And on the Day of Resurrection he will be against them a witness.","[1] One interpretation is that \"his death\" refers to that of Jesus after his return to earth. Or it can mean \"the death of every individual from among the People of the Scripture.\""
  4,160,"For wrongdoing on the part of the Jews, We made unlawful for them [certain] good foods which had been lawful to them, and for their averting from the way of Allāh many [people],",""
  4,161,"And [for] their taking of usury while they had been forbidden from it, and their consuming of the people's wealth unjustly. And We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.",""
  4,162,"But those firm in knowledge among them and the believers believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muḥammad], and what was revealed before you. And the establishers of prayer [especially] and the givers of zakāh and the believers in Allāh and the Last Day - those We will give a great reward.",""
