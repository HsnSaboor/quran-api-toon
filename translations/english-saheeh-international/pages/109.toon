quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,10,"But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs - those are the companions of Hellfire.",""
  5,11,"O you who have believed, remember the favor of Allāh upon you when a people determined to extend their hands [in aggression] against you, but He withheld their hands from you; and fear Allāh. And upon Allāh let the believers rely.",""
  5,12,"And Allāh had already taken a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We delegated from among them twelve leaders. And Allāh said, \"I am with you. If you establish prayer and give zakāh and believe in My messengers and support them and loan Allāh a goodly loan,[1] I will surely remove from you your misdeeds and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow. But whoever of you disbelieves after that has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.\"","[1] By spending in the cause of Allāh, seeking His reward."
  5,13,"So for their breaking of the covenant We cursed them and made their hearts hardened. They distort words from their [proper] places [i.e., usages] and have forgotten a portion of that of which they were reminded.[1] And you will still observe deceit among them, except a few of them. But pardon them and overlook [their misdeeds]. Indeed, Allāh loves the doers of good.","[1] In the Torah concerning the coming of Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ)."
