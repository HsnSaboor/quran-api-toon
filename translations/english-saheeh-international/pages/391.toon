quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  28,44,"And you, [O Muḥammad], were not on the western side [of the mount] when We revealed to Moses the command, and you were not among the witnesses [to that].",""
  28,45,"But We produced [many] generations [after Moses], and prolonged was their duration.[1] And you were not a resident among the people of Madyan, reciting to them Our verses, but We were senders [of this message].[2]","[1] So they forgot and neglected the ordinances of Allāh.\n[2] The Prophet (ﷺ) had no way of obtaining this information except through Allāh's revelation."
  28,46,"And you were not at the side of the mount when We called [Moses] but [were sent] as a mercy from your Lord to warn a people to whom no warner had come before you that they might be reminded.",""
  28,47,"And if not that a disaster should strike them for what their hands put forth [of sins] and they would say, \"Our Lord, why did You not send us a messenger so we could have followed Your verses and been among the believers?\"...[1]","[1] The conclusion of the sentence is understood to be \"...We would not have sent messengers,\" meaning that Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) sent messengers and sent Muḥammad (ﷺ) with the final scripture to mankind so that no one could claim that punishment was imposed unjustly without warning."
  28,48,"But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, \"Why was he not given like that which was given to Moses?\" Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Moses before? They said, \"[They are but] two works of magic supporting each other,[1] and indeed we are, in both, disbelievers.\"","[1] The reference is by the disbelievers of Quraysh to the Qur’ān and the Torah."
  28,49,"Say, \"Then bring a scripture from Allāh which is more guiding than either of them that I may follow it, if you should be truthful.\"",""
  28,50,"But if they do not respond to you - then know that they only follow their [own] desires. And who is more astray than one who follows his desire without guidance from Allāh? Indeed, Allāh does not guide the wrongdoing people.",""
