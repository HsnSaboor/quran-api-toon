  6,53,"And thus We have tried some of them through others that they [i.e., the disbelievers] might say, \"Is it these whom Allāh has favored among us?\" Is not Allāh most knowing of those who are grateful?[1]","[1] Those referred to in verses 52-54 are the poor Muslims who were sincere believers and students of the Prophet (ﷺ). The influential leaders of Quraysh had disdained to sit with them, saying to Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ), \"Perhaps if you evicted them, we would follow you.\""
  6,54,"And when those come to you who believe in Our verses, say, \"Peace be upon you. Your Lord has decreed upon Himself mercy: that any of you who does wrong out of ignorance and then repents after that and corrects himself - indeed, He is Forgiving and Merciful.\"",""
  6,55,"And thus do We detail the verses, and [thus] the way of the criminals will become evident.",""
  6,56,"Say, \"Indeed, I have been forbidden to worship those you invoke besides Allāh.\" Say, \"I will not follow your desires, for I would then have gone astray, and I would not be of the [rightly] guided.\"",""
  6,57,"Say, \"Indeed, I am on clear evidence from my Lord, and you have denied it. I do not have that for which you are impatient.[1] The decision is only for Allāh. He relates the truth, and He is the best of deciders.\"","[1] The disbelievers would challenge the Prophet (ﷺ), telling him to bring on Allāh's punishment if he should be truthful in his warning."
  6,58,"Say, \"If I had that for which you are impatient, the matter would have been decided between me and you, but Allāh is most knowing of the wrongdoers.\"",""
  6,59,"And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him. And He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it. And no grain is there within the darknesses of the earth and no moist or dry [thing] but that it is [written] in a clear record.",""
