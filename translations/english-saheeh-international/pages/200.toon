quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,80,"Ask forgiveness for them, [O Muḥammad], or do not ask forgiveness for them. If you should ask forgiveness for them seventy times - never will Allāh forgive them. That is because they disbelieved in Allāh and His Messenger, and Allāh does not guide the defiantly disobedient people.",""
  9,81,"Those who remained behind[1] rejoiced in their staying [at home] after [the departure of] the Messenger of Allāh and disliked to strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allāh and said, \"Do not go forth in the heat.\" Say, \"The fire of Hell is more intense in heat\" - if they would but understand.","[1] Literally, \"were left behind [as Allāh willed]\" due to their false excuses having been accepted by the Prophet (ﷺ). While pleased with their assumed deception, in reality, Allāh had prevented their participation knowing of their hypocrisy and evil intent."
  9,82,"So let them laugh a little and [then] weep much as recompense for what they used to earn.",""
  9,83,"If Allāh should return you to a faction of them [after the expedition] and then they ask your permission to go out [to battle], say, \"You will not go out with me, ever, and you will never fight with me an enemy. Indeed, you were satisfied with sitting [at home] the first time, so sit [now] with those who stay behind.\"",""
  9,84,"And do not pray [the funeral prayer, O Muḥammad], over any of them who has died - ever - or stand at his grave. Indeed, they disbelieved in Allāh and His Messenger and died while they were defiantly disobedient.",""
  9,85,"And let not their wealth and their children impress you. Allāh only intends to punish them through them in this world and that their souls should depart [at death] while they are disbelievers.",""
  9,86,"And when a sūrah was revealed [enjoining them] to believe in Allāh and to fight with His Messenger, those of wealth among them asked your permission [to stay back] and said, \"Leave us to be with them who sit [at home].\"",""
