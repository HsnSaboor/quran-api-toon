  47,1,"Those who disbelieve and avert [people] from the way of Allāh - He will waste their deeds.[1]","[1] i.e., cause them to be lost or make them worthless, earning no reward."
  47,2,"And those who believe and do righteous deeds and believe in what has been sent down upon Muḥammad - and it is the truth from their Lord - He will remove from them their misdeeds and amend their condition.",""
  47,3,"That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, and those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus does Allāh present to the people their comparisons.[1]","[1] So that they may know the results of their choice."
  47,4,"So when you meet those who disbelieve [in battle], strike [their] necks until, when you have inflicted slaughter upon them, then secure [their] bonds,[1] and either [confer] favor[2] afterwards or ransom [them] until the war lays down its burdens.[3] That [is the command]. And if Allāh had willed, He could have taken vengeance upon them [Himself], but [He ordered armed struggle] to test some of you by means of others. And those who are killed in the cause of Allāh - never will He waste their deeds.","[1] i.e., take those remaining as captives.\n[2] i.e., release them without ransom.\n[3] i.e., its armor, machinery, etc., meaning \"until the war is over.\""
