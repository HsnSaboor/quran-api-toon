quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,253,"Those messengers - some of them We caused to exceed others. Among them were those to whom Allāh spoke, and He raised some of them in degree. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs, and We supported him with the Pure Spirit [i.e., Gabriel]. If Allāh had willed, those [generations] succeeding them would not have fought each other after the clear proofs had come to them. But they differed, and some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. And if Allāh had willed, they would not have fought each other, but Allāh does what He intends.",""
  2,254,"O you who have believed, spend from that which We have provided for you before there comes a Day in which there is no exchange [i.e., ransom] and no friendship and no intercession. And the disbelievers - they are the wrongdoers.",""
  2,255,"Allāh - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living,[1] the Self-Sustaining.[2] Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them,[3] and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursī[4] extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High,[5] the Most Great.[6]","[1] Whose life is perfect, complete and eternal, without beginning or end, and through whom all created life originated and continues.\n[2] Dependent on none for His existence while being the sustainer and administrator of all created existence.\n[3] Allāh's knowledge encompasses every aspect of His creations in the past, present and future.\n[4] Chair or footstool. It is not to be confused with al-ʿArsh (the Throne) , which is infinitely higher and greater than al-Kursī.\n[5] Above all of His creations and superior to them in essence, rank and position.\n[6] Whose greatness is unlimited, beyond description or imagination."
  2,256,"There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become distinct from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in ṭāghūt[1] and believes in Allāh has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allāh is Hearing and Knowing.","[1] False objects of worship, such as idols, heavenly bodies, spirits, human beings, etc."
