quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,100,"And the first forerunners [in the faith] among the Muhājireen[1] and the Anṣār[2] and those who followed them with good conduct - Allāh is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment.","[1] Those who emigrated from Makkah and settled in Madīnah for the cause of Islām.\n[2] The inhabitants of Madīnah who had accepted Islām and assisted the Prophet (ﷺ) and other emigrants upon their arrival there."
  9,101,"And among those around you of the bedouins are hypocrites, and [also] from the people of Madīnah. They have persisted in hypocrisy. You, [O Muḥammad], do not know them, [but] We know them. We will punish them twice [in this world]; then they will be returned to a great punishment.",""
  9,102,"And [there are] others who have acknowledged their sins. They had mixed [i.e., polluted] a righteous deed with another that was bad.[1] Perhaps Allāh will turn to them in forgiveness. Indeed, Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.","[1] This refers to their having previously taken part in jihād but having abstained on the occasion of Tabūk."
  9,103,"Take, [O Muḥammad], from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase, and invoke [Allāh's blessings] upon them. Indeed, your invocations are reassurance for them. And Allāh is Hearing and Knowing.",""
  9,104,"Do they not know that it is Allāh who accepts repentance from His servants and receives charities and that it is Allāh who is the Accepting of Repentance,[1] the Merciful?","[1] Refer to footnote in 2:37."
  9,105,"And say, \"Do [as you will], for Allāh will see your deeds, and [so will] His Messenger and the believers. And you will be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you of what you used to do.\"",""
  9,106,"And [there are] others deferred until the command of Allāh - whether He will punish them or whether He will forgive them. And Allāh is Knowing and Wise.",""
