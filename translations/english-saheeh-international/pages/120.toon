quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,71,"And they thought there would be no [resulting] punishment, so they became blind and deaf. Then Allāh turned to them in forgiveness; then [again] many of them became blind and deaf. And Allāh is Seeing of what they do.",""
  5,72,"They have certainly disbelieved who say, \"Allāh is the Messiah, the son of Mary\" while the Messiah has said, \"O Children of Israel, worship Allāh, my Lord and your Lord.\" Indeed, he who associates others with Allāh - Allāh has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers.",""
  5,73,"They have certainly disbelieved who say, \"Allāh is the third of three.\"[1] And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.","[1] i.e., one part of three, referring to the Christian concept of trinity."
  5,74,"So will they not repent to Allāh and seek His forgiveness? And Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.",""
  5,75,"The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. They both used to eat food.[1] Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.","[1] They were in need of sustenance, proving that they were creations of Allāh, not divine beings."
  5,76,"Say, \"Do you worship besides Allāh that which holds for you no [power of] harm or benefit while it is Allāh who is the Hearing, the Knowing?\"",""
