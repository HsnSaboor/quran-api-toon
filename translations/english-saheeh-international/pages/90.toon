quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,75,"And what is [the matter] with you that you fight not in the cause of Allāh and [for] the oppressed among men, women and children who say, \"Our Lord, take us out of this city of oppressive people and appoint for us from Yourself a protector and appoint for us from Yourself a helper\"?",""
  4,76,"Those who believe fight in the cause of Allāh, and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of ṭāghūt.[1] So fight against the allies of Satan. Indeed, the plot of Satan has ever been weak.","[1] See footnote to 4:60."
  4,77,"Have you not seen those who were told, \"Restrain your hands [from fighting][1] and establish prayer and give zakāh\"? But then when battle was ordained for them, at once a party of them feared men as they fear Allāh or with [even] greater fear. They said, \"Our Lord, why have You decreed upon us fighting? If only You had postponed [it for] us for a short time.\" Say, \"The enjoyment of this world is little, and the Hereafter is better for he who fears Allāh. And injustice will not be done to you, [even] as much as a thread [inside a date seed].\"","[1] Before permission was given by Allāh."
  4,78,"Wherever you may be, death will overtake you, even if you should be within towers of lofty construction. But if good comes to them, they say, \"This is from Allāh\"; and if evil befalls them, they say,[1] \"This is from you.\" Say, \"All [things] are from Allāh.\" So what is [the matter] with those people that they can hardly understand any statement?","[1] Addressing the Prophet (ﷺ)."
  4,79,"What comes to you of good is from Allāh, but what comes to you of evil, [O man], is from yourself.[1] And We have sent you, [O Muḥammad], to the people as a messenger, and sufficient is Allāh as Witness.[2]","[1] As a result of your mistakes or sins.\n[2] i.e., never absent, always seeing and having complete knowledge of everything within His dominion."
