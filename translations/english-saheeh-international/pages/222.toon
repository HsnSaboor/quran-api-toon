quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  11,6,"And there is no creature on earth but that upon Allāh is its provision, and He knows its place of dwelling and place of storage.[1] All is in a clear register.","[1] Before birth and after death."
  11,7,"And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days - and His Throne had been upon water - that He might test you as to which of you is best in deed. But if you say, \"Indeed, you are resurrected after death,\" those who disbelieve will surely say, \"This is not but obvious magic.\"",""
  11,8,"And if We hold back from them the punishment for a limited time, they will surely say,[1] \"What detains it?\" Unquestionably, on the Day it comes to them, it will not be averted from them, and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule.","[1] In ridicule and disbelief."
  11,9,"And if We give man a taste of mercy from Us and then We withdraw it from him, indeed, he is despairing and ungrateful.",""
  11,10,"But if We give him a taste of favor after hardship has touched him, he will surely say, \"Bad times have left me.\" Indeed, he is exultant and boastful -",""
  11,11,"Except for those who are patient and do righteous deeds; those will have forgiveness and great reward.",""
  11,12,"Then would you possibly leave [out] some of what is revealed to you,[1] or is your breast constrained by it because they say, \"Why has there not been sent down to him a treasure or come with him an angel?\" But you are only a warner. And Allāh is Disposer of all things.","[1] Knowing of the Prophet's difficulties, Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) urges him to patience, certain that he would not fail to convey the message in its entirety."
