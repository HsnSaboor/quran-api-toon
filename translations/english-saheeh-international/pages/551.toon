quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  60,12,"O Prophet, when the believing women come to you pledging to you that they will not associate anything with Allāh, nor will they steal, nor will they commit unlawful sexual intercourse, nor will they kill their children, nor will they bring forth a slander they have invented between their arms and legs,[1] nor will they disobey you in what is right - then accept their pledge and ask forgiveness for them of Allāh. Indeed, Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.","[1] This is an allusion to pregnancy and childbirth, i.e., to falsely attribute a child (whether adopted or born of adultery) to a woman's husband."
  60,13,"O you who have believed, do not make allies of a people with whom Allāh has become angry. They have despaired of [reward in] the Hereafter just as the disbelievers have despaired of [meeting] the companions [i.e., inhabitants] of the graves.",""
  61,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth exalts Allāh,[1] and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.","[1] See footnote to 57:1."
  61,2,"O you who have believed, why do you say what you do not do?",""
  61,3,"Greatly hateful in the sight of Allāh is that you say what you do not do.",""
  61,4,"Indeed, Allāh loves those who fight in His cause in a row as though they are a [single] structure joined firmly.",""
  61,5,"And [mention, O Muḥammad], when Moses said to his people, \"O my people, why do you harm me while you certainly know that I am the messenger of Allāh to you?\" And when they deviated, Allāh caused their hearts to deviate. And Allāh does not guide the defiantly disobedient people.",""
