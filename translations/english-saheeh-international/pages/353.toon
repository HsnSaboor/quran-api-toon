quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  24,28,"And if you do not find anyone therein, do not enter them until permission has been given you. And if it is said to you, \"Go back,\"[1] then go back; it is purer for you. And Allāh is Knowing of what you do.","[1] Or a similar expression showing that the occupants are not prepared to receive visitors (which should be respected)."
  24,29,"There is no blame upon you for entering houses not inhabited in which there is convenience[1] for you. And Allāh knows what you reveal and what you conceal.","[1] Some benefit such as rest, shelter, commodities, one's personal belongings, etc."
  24,30,"Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision[1] and guard their private parts.[2] That is purer for them. Indeed, Allāh is [fully] Aware of what they do.","[1] Looking only at what is lawful and averting their eyes from what is unlawful.\n[2] From being seen and from unlawful acts."
  24,31,"And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision[1] and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment[2] except that which [necessarily] appears thereof[3] and to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests and not expose their adornment [i.e., beauty] except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess [i.e., slaves], or those male attendants having no physical desire,[4] or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women. And let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment. And turn to Allāh in repentance, all of you, O believers, that you might succeed.","[1] Looking only at what is lawful and averting their eyes from what is unlawful.\n[2] Both natural beauty, such as hair or body shape, and that with which a woman beautifies herself of clothing, jewelry, etc.\n[3] i.e., the outer garments or whatever might appear out of necessity, such as a part of the face or the hands.\n[4] Referring to an abnormal condition in which a man is devoid of sexual feeling."
