quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  35,39,"It is He who has made you successors upon the earth. And whoever disbelieves - upon him will be [the consequence of] his disbelief. And the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them in the sight of their Lord except in hatred; and the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them except in loss.",""
  35,40,"Say, \"Have you considered[1] your 'partners' whom you invoke besides Allāh? Show me what they have created from the earth, or have they partnership [with Him] in the heavens? Or have We given them a book so they are [standing] on evidence therefrom? [No], rather, the wrongdoers do not promise each other except delusion.\"[2]","[1] Understood to mean \"Tell me about...\"\n[2] By telling their followers that the so-called deities will intercede for them with Allāh."
  35,41,"Indeed, Allāh holds the heavens and the earth, lest they cease. And if they should cease, no one could hold them [in place] after Him. Indeed, He is Forbearing[1] and Forgiving.","[1] Refer to footnote in 2:225."
  35,42,"And they swore by Allāh their strongest oaths that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than [any] one of the [previous] nations. But when a warner came to them, it did not increase them except in aversion",""
  35,43,"[Due to] arrogance in the land and plotting of evil; but the evil plot does not encompass except its own people. Then do they await except the way [i.e., fate] of the former peoples? But you will never find in the way [i.e., established method] of Allāh any change, and you will never find in the way of Allāh[1] any alteration.[2]","[1] i.e., in His punishment of those who deny the prophets.\n[2] Or \"transfer\" of punishment to others in place of them."
  35,44,"Have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them? And they were greater than them in power. But Allāh is not to be caused failure [i.e., prevented] by anything in the heavens or on the earth. Indeed, He is ever Knowing and Competent.",""
