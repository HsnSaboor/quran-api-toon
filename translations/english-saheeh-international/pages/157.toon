quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,52,"And We had certainly brought them a Book which We detailed by knowledge - as guidance and mercy to a people who believe.",""
  7,53,"Do they await except its result?[1] The Day its result comes, those who had ignored it before will say, \"The messengers of our Lord had come with the truth, so are there [now] any intercessors to intercede for us or could we be sent back to do other than what we used to do?\" They will have lost themselves, and lost from them is what they used to invent.","[1] The fulfillment of what is promised in the Qur’ān."
  7,54,"Indeed, your Lord is Allāh, who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne.[1] He covers the night with the day, [another night] chasing it rapidly; and [He created] the sun, the moon, and the stars, subjected by His command. Unquestionably, His is the creation and the command; blessed is Allāh, Lord of the worlds.","[1] There are several linguistic meanings of the words \"istawā ʿalā,\" among them: to settle upon, to assume ascendancy above, and to assert authority over. However, it is known that all the attributes of Allāh are eternal, i.e., they have always existed and were present before He created. Thus, it cannot be said that He \"rose\" above the Throne, as Allāh has always been ascendant. Because the Creator may not be compared to His creation, the Prophet's companions and early scholars refused speculation as to how His actions could be interpreted, considering any such attempt unlawful. Similarly, the true nature of the Throne is known only to Allāh, the Exalted."
  7,55,"Call upon your Lord in humility and privately; indeed, He does not like transgressors.[1]","[1] In supplication or otherwise."
  7,56,"And cause not corruption upon the earth after its reformation. And invoke Him in fear and aspiration. Indeed, the mercy of Allāh is near to the doers of good.",""
  7,57,"And it is He who sends the winds as good tidings before His mercy [i.e., rainfall] until, when they have carried heavy rainclouds, We drive them to a dead land and We send down rain therein and bring forth thereby [some] of all the fruits. Thus will We bring forth the dead; perhaps you may be reminded.",""
