  21,1,"[The time of] their account has approached for the people, while they are in heedlessness turning away.",""
  21,2,"No mention [i.e., revelation] comes to them anew from their Lord except that they listen to it while they are at play",""
  21,3,"With their hearts distracted. And those who do wrong conceal their private conversation, [saying], \"Is this [Prophet] except a human being like you? So would you approach magic while you are aware [of it]?\"",""
  21,4,"He [the Prophet (ﷺ)] said, \"My Lord knows whatever is said throughout the heaven and earth, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.\"",""
  21,5,"But they say, \"[The revelation is but] a mixture of false dreams; rather, he has invented it; rather, he is a poet. So let him bring us a sign just as the previous [messengers] were sent [with miracles].\"",""
  21,6,"Not a [single] city which We destroyed believed before them,[1] so will they believe?","[1] Even though they had witnessed signs and miracles."
  21,7,"And We sent not before you, [O Muḥammad], except men to whom We revealed [the message], so ask the people of the message [i.e., former scriptures] if you do not know.",""
  21,8,"And We did not make them [i.e., the prophets] forms not eating food,[1] nor were they immortal [on earth].","[1] Like the angels. Rather, they were human beings with human attributes."
