quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,14,"And from those who say, \"We are Christians\" We took their covenant; but they forgot a portion of that of which they were reminded.[1] So We caused among them[2] animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. And Allāh is going to inform them about what they used to do.","[1] In the Gospel concerning the coming of Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ).\n[2] i.e., among their various denominations or sects."
  5,15,"O People of the Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger making clear to you much of what you used to conceal of the Scripture and overlooking much.[1] There has come to you from Allāh a light and a clear Book [i.e., the Qur’ān]","[1] Of your sin in that regard."
  5,16,"By which Allāh guides those who pursue His pleasure to the ways of peace[1] and brings them out from darknesses into the light, by His permission, and guides them to a straight path.","[1] i.e., security, well-being, integrity and escape from Hellfire. Literally, \"freedom from all evil.\""
  5,17,"They have certainly disbelieved who say that Allāh is Christ, the son of Mary. Say, \"Then who could prevent Allāh at all if He had intended to destroy Christ, the son of Mary, or his mother or everyone on the earth?\" And to Allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. He creates what He wills, and Allāh is over all things competent.",""
