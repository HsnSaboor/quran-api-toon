quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  22,65,"Do you not see that Allāh has subjected to you whatever is on the earth and the ships which run through the sea by His command? And He restrains the sky from falling upon the earth, unless by His permission. Indeed Allāh, to the people, is Kind and Merciful.",""
  22,66,"And He is the one who gave you life; then He causes you to die and then will [again] give you life. Indeed, mankind is ungrateful.",""
  22,67,"For every [religious] community We have appointed rites which they perform. So, [O Muḥammad], let them [i.e., the disbelievers] not contend with you over the matter but invite [them] to your Lord. Indeed, you are upon straight guidance.",""
  22,68,"And if they dispute with you, then say, \"Allāh is most knowing of what you do.",""
  22,69,"Allāh will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which you used to differ.\"",""
  22,70,"Do you not know that Allāh knows what is in the heaven and earth? Indeed, that is in a Record.[1] Indeed that, for Allāh, is easy.","[1] The Preserved Slate (al-Lawḥ al-Maḥfūẓ), which is with Allāh."
  22,71,"And they worship besides Allāh that for which He has not sent down authority and that of which they have no knowledge. And there will not be for the wrongdoers any helper.",""
  22,72,"And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, you recognize in the faces of those who disbelieve disapproval. They are almost on the verge of assaulting those who recite to them Our verses. Say, \"Then shall I inform you of [what is] worse than that?[1] [It is] the Fire which Allāh has promised those who disbelieve, and wretched is the destination.\"","[1] i.e., worse than the rage you feel against those who recite Allāh's verses or worse than your threats against them."
