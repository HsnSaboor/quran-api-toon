quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,260,"And [mention] when Abraham said, \"My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead.\" [Allāh] said, \"Have you not believed?\" He said, \"Yes, but [I ask] only that my heart may be satisfied.\" [Allāh] said, \"Take four birds and commit them to yourself.[1] Then [after slaughtering them] put on each hill a portion of them; then call them - they will come [flying] to you in haste. And know that Allāh is Exalted in Might and Wise.\"","[1] i.e., train them to come to you on command."
  2,261,"The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allāh is like a seed [of grain] which grows seven spikes; in each spike is a hundred grains. And Allāh multiplies [His reward] for whom He wills. And Allāh is all-Encompassing and Knowing.",""
  2,262,"Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allāh and then do not follow up what they have spent with reminders [of it] or [other] injury will have their reward with their Lord, and there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.",""
  2,263,"Kind speech and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury. And Allāh is Free of need and Forbearing.",""
  2,264,"O you who have believed, do not invalidate your charities with reminders [of it] or injury as does one who spends his wealth [only] to be seen by the people and does not believe in Allāh and the Last Day. His example is like that of a [large] smooth stone upon which is dust and is hit by a downpour that leaves it bare. They are unable [to keep] anything of what they have earned. And Allāh does not guide the disbelieving people.",""
