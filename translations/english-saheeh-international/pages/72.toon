quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,166,"And what struck you on the day the two armies met [at Uḥud] was by permission of Allāh that He might make evident the [true] believers",""
  3,167,"And that He might make evident those who are hypocrites. For it was said to them, \"Come, fight in the way of Allāh or [at least] defend.\" They said, \"If we had known [there would be] battle, we would have followed you.\" They were nearer to disbelief that day than to faith, saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts. And Allāh is most knowing of what they conceal -",""
  3,168,"Those who said about their brothers while sitting [at home], \"If they had obeyed us, they would not have been killed.\" Say, \"Then prevent death from yourselves, if you should be truthful.\"",""
  3,169,"And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allāh as dead. Rather, they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision,",""
  3,170,"Rejoicing in what Allāh has bestowed upon them of His bounty, and they receive good tidings about those [to be martyred] after them who have not yet joined them - that there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.",""
  3,171,"They receive good tidings of favor from Allāh and bounty and [of the fact] that Allāh does not allow the reward of believers to be lost -",""
  3,172,"Those [believers] who responded to Allāh and the Messenger after injury had struck them. For those who did good among them and feared Allāh is a great reward -",""
  3,173,"Those to whom people [i.e., hypocrites] said, \"Indeed, the people have gathered against you, so fear them.\" But it [merely] increased them in faith, and they said, \"Sufficient for us is Allāh, and [He is] the best Disposer of affairs.\"[1]","[1] The one entrusted and relied upon; sufficient to manage all matters."
