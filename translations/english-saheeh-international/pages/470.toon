quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  40,26,"And Pharaoh said, \"Let me kill Moses and let him call upon his Lord. Indeed, I fear that he will change your religion or that he will cause corruption[1] in the land.\"","[1] i.e., dissension or civil strife."
  40,27,"But Moses said, \"Indeed, I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in the Day of Account.\"",""
  40,28,"And a believing man from the family of Pharaoh who concealed his faith said, \"Do you kill a man [merely] because he says, 'My Lord is Allāh' while he has brought you clear proofs from your Lord? And if he should be lying, then upon him is [the consequence of] his lie; but if he should be truthful, there will strike you some of what he promises you. Indeed, Allāh does not guide one who is a transgressor and a liar.",""
  40,29,"O my people, sovereignty is yours today, [your being] dominant in the land. But who would protect us from the punishment of Allāh if it came to us?\" Pharaoh said, \"I do not show you except what I see, and I do not guide you except to the way of right conduct.\"",""
  40,30,"And he who believed said, \"O my people, indeed I fear for you [a fate] like the day of the companies[1] -","[1] i.e., the days on which Allāh sent His punishment upon those who rejected their prophets in former times."
  40,31,"Like the custom of the people of Noah and of ʿAad and Thamūd and those after them. And Allāh wants no injustice for [His] servants.",""
  40,32,"And O my people, indeed I fear for you the Day of Calling[1] -","[1] i.e., the Day of Judgement, when the criminals will cry out in terror, the people will call to each other (see 7:44-51), and the angels will call out the results of each person's judgement."
  40,33,"The Day you will turn your backs fleeing; there is not for you from Allāh any protector. And whoever Allāh sends astray - there is not for him any guide.",""
