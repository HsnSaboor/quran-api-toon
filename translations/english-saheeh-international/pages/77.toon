quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,1,"O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women. And fear Allāh, through whom[1] you ask one another,[2] and the wombs.[3] Indeed Allāh is ever,[4] over you, an Observer.[5]","[1] In whose name.\n[2] i.e., request favors and demand rights.\n[3] i.e., fear Allāh in regard to relations of kinship.\n[4] When used in conjunction with Allāh's attributes, the word \"ever\" (occurring repeatedly throughout this sūrah and elsewhere, such as in sūrah al-Aḥzāb) is quite inadequate in imparting the sense of continuation expressed by the word \"kāna\" in Arabic, which indicates \"always was, is, and always will be.\"\n[5] Ever-present and taking account of everything."
  4,2,"And give to the orphans their properties and do not substitute the defective [of your own] for the good [of theirs]. And do not consume their properties into your own. Indeed, that is ever a great sin.",""
  4,3,"And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hands possess [i.e., slaves]. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice].",""
  4,4,"And give the women [upon marriage] their [bridal] gifts[1] graciously. But if they give up willingly to you anything of it, then take it in satisfaction and ease.[2]","[1] The obligatory bridal gift (mahr).\n[2] Knowing that it is lawful."
  4,5,"And do not give the weak-minded your property,[1] which Allāh has made a means of sustenance for you, but provide for them with it and clothe them and speak to them words of appropriate kindness.","[1] Although it is their property, Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) refers to it in the collective sense, reminding us that all wealth is provided by Him for the maintenance of the community as well as of individual members."
  4,6,"And test the orphans [in their abilities] until they reach marriageable age. Then if you perceive in them sound judgement, release their property to them. And do not consume it excessively and quickly, [anticipating] that they will grow up. And whoever, [when acting as guardian], is self-sufficient should refrain [from taking a fee]; and whoever is poor - let him take according to what is acceptable. Then when you release their property to them, bring witnesses upon them. And sufficient is Allāh as Accountant.",""
