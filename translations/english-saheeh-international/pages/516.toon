quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  49,5,"And if they had been patient until you [could] come out to them, it would have been better for them. But Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful."
  49,6,"O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate, lest you harm a people out of ignorance and become, over what you have done, regretful."
  49,7,"And know that among you is the Messenger of Allāh. If he were to obey you in much of the matter, you would be in difficulty, but Allāh has endeared to you the faith and has made it pleasing in your hearts and has made hateful to you disbelief, defiance and disobedience. Those are the [rightly] guided."
  49,8,"[It is] as bounty from Allāh and favor. And Allāh is Knowing and Wise."
  49,9,"And if two factions among the believers should fight, then make settlement between the two. But if one of them oppresses the other, then fight against the one that oppresses until it returns to the ordinance of Allāh. And if it returns, then make settlement between them in justice and act justly. Indeed, Allāh loves those who act justly."
  49,10,"The believers are but brothers, so make settlement between your brothers. And fear Allāh that you may receive mercy."
  49,11,"O you who have believed, let not a people ridicule [another] people; perhaps they may be better than them; nor let women ridicule [other] women; perhaps they may be better than them. And do not insult one another and do not call each other by [offensive] nicknames. Wretched is the name [i.e., mention] of disobedience after [one's] faith. And whoever does not repent - then it is those who are the wrongdoers."
