  57,4,"It is He who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne.[1] He knows what penetrates into the earth and what emerges from it and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein; and He is with you[2] wherever you are. And Allāh, of what you do, is Seeing.","[1] See footnotes to 2:19 and 7:54.\n[2] In knowledge - observing and witnessing."
  57,5,"His is the dominion of the heavens and earth. And to Allāh are returned [all] matters.",""

Not equal among you are those who spent before the conquest [of Makkah] and fought [and those who did so after it]. Those are greater in degree than they who spent afterwards and fought. But to all Allāh has promised the best [reward]. And Allāh, of what you do, is Aware.",""
