quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  16,35,"And those who associate others with Allāh say, \"If Allāh had willed, we would not have worshipped anything other than Him, neither we nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything through other than Him.\" Thus did those do before them. So is there upon the messengers except [the duty of] clear notification?",""
  16,36,"And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], \"Worship Allāh and avoid ṭāghūt.\"[1] And among them were those whom Allāh guided, and among them were those upon whom error was [deservedly] decreed. So proceed [i.e., travel] through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers.","[1] False objects of worship."
  16,37,"[Even] if you should strive for their guidance, [O Muḥammad], indeed, Allāh does not guide those He sends astray,[1] and they will have no helpers.","[1] As a result of their choice to reject guidance."
  16,38,"And they swear by Allāh their strongest oaths [that] Allāh will not resurrect one who dies. But yes - [it is] a true promise [binding] upon Him, but most of the people do not know.",""
  16,39,"[It is] so He will make clear to them [the truth of] that wherein they differ and so those who have disbelieved may know that they were liars.",""
  16,40,"Indeed, Our word to a thing when We intend it is but that We say to it, \"Be,\" and it is.",""
  16,41,"And those who emigrated for [the cause of] Allāh after they had been wronged - We will surely settle them in this world in a good place; but the reward of the Hereafter is greater, if only they could know.",""
  16,42,"[They are] those who endured patiently and upon their Lord relied.",""
