quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,191,"And kill them [in battle] wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, and fitnah[1] is worse than killing. And do not fight them at al-Masjid al-Ḥarām until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.","[1] Among the meanings of fitnah are disbelief and its imposition on others, discord, dissension, civil strife, persecution, oppression, injustice, seduction, terrorism, trial and torment."
  2,192,"And if they cease, then indeed, Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.",""
  2,193,"Fight them until there is no [more] fitnah and [until] religion [i.e., worship] is [acknowledged to be] for Allāh. But if they cease, then there is to be no aggression [i.e., assault] except against the oppressors.",""
  2,194,"[Battle in] the sacred month is for [aggression committed in] the sacred month,[1] and for [all] violations is legal retribution. So whoever has assaulted you, then assault him in the same way that he has assaulted you. And fear Allāh and know that Allāh is with those who fear Him.","[1] The sacred months are Dhul-Qaʿdah, Dhul-Ḥijjah, Muḥarram and Rajab."
  2,195,"And spend in the way of Allāh and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction [by refraining]. And do good; indeed, Allāh loves the doers of good.",""
  2,196,"And complete the ḥajj and ʿumrah for Allāh. But if you are prevented, then [offer] what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals. And do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal has reached its place of slaughter. And whoever among you is ill or has an ailment of the head [making shaving necessary must offer] a ransom of fasting [three days] or charity[1] or sacrifice.[2] And when you are secure,[3] then whoever performs ʿumrah [during the ḥajj months][4] followed by ḥajj [offers] what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals. And whoever cannot find [or afford such an animal] - then a fast of three days during ḥajj and of seven when you have returned [home]. Those are ten complete [days]. This is for those whose family is not in the area of al-Masjid al-Ḥarām. And fear Allāh and know that Allāh is severe in penalty.","[1] Feeding six needy persons.\n[2] The slaughter of a sheep or goat.\n[3] Under normal conditions, i.e., are not prevented.\n[4] The months of Shawwāl, Dhul-Qaʿdah and Dhul-Ḥijjah."
