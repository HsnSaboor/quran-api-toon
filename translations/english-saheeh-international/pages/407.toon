  30,26,"And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and earth. All are to Him devoutly obedient.",""
  30,27,"And it is He who begins creation; then He repeats it, and that is [even] easier for Him. To Him belongs the highest description [i.e., attribute] in the heavens and earth. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.",""
  30,28,"He presents to you an example from yourselves. Do you have among those whom your right hands possess [i.e., slaves] any partners in what We have provided for you so that you are equal therein [and] would fear them as your fear of one another [within a partnership]?[1] Thus do We detail the verses for a people who use reason.","[1] See footnote to 16:71."

  30,30,"So direct your face [i.e., self] toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the fiṭrah[1] of Allāh upon which He has created [all] people. No change should there be in the creation of Allāh.[2] That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.","[1] The natural inborn inclination of man to worship his Creator prior to the corruption of his nature by external influences. Thus, Islāmic monotheism is described as the religion of fiṭrah - that of the inherent nature of mankind.\n[2] i.e., let people remain true to their fiṭrah within the religion of Islām."
