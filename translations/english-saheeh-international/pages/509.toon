quran[10]{c,v,t,f}:
  47,20,"Those who believe say, \"Why has a sūrah[1] not been sent down?\" But when a precise sūrah is revealed and battle is mentioned therein, you see those in whose hearts is disease [i.e., hypocrisy] looking at you with a look of one overcome by death. And more appropriate for them[2] [would have been]","[1] i.e., one in which permission is given the believers to fight their enemies.\n[2] The words \"awlā lahum\" can also be interpreted as \"woe to them!\" In that case, the following verse would begin, \"[Better for them would have been] obedience and good words.\""
  47,21,"Obedience and good words. And when the matter [of fighting] was determined, if they had been true to Allāh, it would have been better for them.",""
  47,22,"So would you perhaps, if you turned away,[1] cause corruption on earth and sever your [ties of] relationship?","[1] From Islām or from jihād (struggling in the cause of Allāh)."
  47,23,"Those [who do so] are the ones that Allāh has cursed, so He deafened them and blinded their vision.",""
  47,24,"Then do they not reflect upon the Qur’ān, or are there locks upon [their] hearts?",""
  47,25,"Indeed, those who reverted back [to disbelief] after guidance had become clear to them - Satan enticed them and prolonged hope for them.",""
  47,26,"That is because they said to those who disliked what Allāh sent down,[1] \"We will obey you in part of the matter.\" And Allāh knows what they conceal.","[1] i.e., the Jews of Madīnah."
  47,27,"Then how [will it be] when the angels take them in death, striking their faces and their backs?",""
  47,28,"That is because they followed what angered Allāh and disliked [what earns] His pleasure, so He rendered worthless their deeds.",""
  47,29,"Or do those in whose hearts is disease think that Allāh would never expose their [feelings of] hatred?",""
