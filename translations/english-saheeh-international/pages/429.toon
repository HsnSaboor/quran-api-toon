quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  34,8,"Has he invented about Allāh a lie or is there in him madness?\" Rather, they who do not believe in the Hereafter will be in the punishment and [are in] extreme error.",""
  34,9,"Then, do they not look at what is before them and what is behind them of the heaven and earth? If We should will, We could cause the earth to swallow them or [could] let fall upon them fragments from the sky. Indeed in that is a sign for every servant turning back [to Allāh].",""
  34,10,"And We certainly gave David from Us bounty. [We said], \"O mountains, repeat [Our] praises with him, and the birds [as well].\" And We made pliable for him iron,",""
  34,11,"[Commanding him], \"Make full coats of mail and calculate [precisely] the links, and work [all of you] righteousness. Indeed I, of what you do, am Seeing.\"",""
  34,12,"And to Solomon [We subjected] the wind - its morning [journey was that of] a month - and its afternoon [journey was that of] a month, and We made flow for him a spring of [liquid] copper. And among the jinn were those who worked for him by the permission of his Lord. And whoever deviated among them from Our command - We will make him taste of the punishment of the Blaze.",""
  34,13,"They made for him what he willed of elevated chambers,[1] statues,[2] bowls like reservoirs, and stationary kettles. [We said], \"Work, O family of David, in gratitude.\" And few of My servants are grateful.","[1] Described by commentators as palaces, dwellings, or places of prayer.\n[2] Which were not prohibited until the time of Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ)."
  34,14,"And when We decreed for him [i.e., Solomon] death, nothing indicated to them [i.e., the jinn] his death except a creature of the earth eating his staff.[1] But when he fell, it became clear to the jinn that if they had known the unseen, they would not have remained in humiliating punishment.[2]","[1] Upon which he was leaning at the time of his death. A termite continued to gnaw into the stick until it collapsed under his weight.\n[2] i.e., hard labor. This verse is evidence that the jinn do not possess knowledge of the unseen, which belongs exclusively to Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā)."
