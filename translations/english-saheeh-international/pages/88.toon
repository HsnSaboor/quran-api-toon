quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,60,"Have you not seen those who claim to have believed in what was revealed to you, [O Muḥammad], and what was revealed before you? They wish to refer legislation to ṭāghūt,[1] while they were commanded to reject it; and Satan wishes to lead them far astray.","[1] False objects of worship or those transgressors who usurp the divine right of government."
  4,61,"And when it is said to them, \"Come to what Allāh has revealed and to the Messenger,\" you see the hypocrites turning away from you in aversion.",""
  4,62,"So how [will it be] when disaster strikes them because of what their hands have put forth and then they come to you swearing by Allāh, \"We intended nothing but good conduct and accommodation.\"",""
  4,63,"Those are the ones of whom Allāh knows what is in their hearts, so turn away from them[1] but admonish them and speak to them a far-reaching [i.e., effective] word.","[1] i.e., use not violence against them."
  4,64,"And We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by permission of Allāh. And if, when they wronged themselves, they had come to you, [O Muḥammad], and asked forgiveness of Allāh and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allāh Accepting of Repentance and Merciful.",""
  4,65,"But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Muḥammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission.",""
