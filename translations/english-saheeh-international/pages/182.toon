quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  8,41,"And know that anything you obtain of war booty - then indeed, for Allāh is one fifth of it and for the Messenger[1] and for [his] near relatives[2] and the orphans, the needy, and the [stranded] traveler,[3] if you have believed in Allāh and in that which We sent down to Our Servant[4] on the day of criterion [i.e., decisive encounter] - the day when the two armies met [at Badr]. And Allāh, over all things, is competent.","[1] To be spent in Allāh's cause.\n[2] The tribes of Banū Hāshim and Banū Muṭṭalib, who were not eligible for zakāh.\n[3] The remaining four fifths are divided among the soldiers.\n[4] Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ)."
  8,42,"[Remember] when you were on the near side of the valley, and they were on the farther side, and the caravan was lower [in position] than you. If you had made an appointment [to meet], you would have missed the appointment. But [it was] so that Allāh might accomplish a matter already destined - that those who perished [through disbelief] would perish upon evidence and those who lived [in faith] would live upon evidence; and indeed, Allāh is Hearing and Knowing.",""
  8,43,"[Remember, O Muḥammad], when Allāh showed them to you in your dream as few; and if He had shown them to you as many, you [believers] would have lost courage and would have disputed in the matter [of whether to fight], but Allāh saved [you from that]. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.",""
  8,44,"And [remember] when He showed them to you, when you met, as few in your eyes, and He made you [appear] as few in their eyes so that Allāh might accomplish a matter already destined. And to Allāh are [all] matters returned.",""
  8,45,"O you who have believed, when you encounter a company [from the enemy forces], stand firm and remember Allāh much that you may be successful.",""
