  38,21,"And has there come to you the news of the adversaries, when they climbed over the wall of [his] prayer chamber -",""

  38,24,"[David] said, \"He has certainly wronged you in demanding your ewe [in addition] to his ewes. And indeed, many associates oppress one another, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds - and few are they.\" And David became certain that We had tried him, and he asked forgiveness of his Lord[1] and fell down bowing [in prostration] and turned in repentance [to Allāh].","[1] For his errors, such as fear and suspicion of the two men at the outset, any mistake in judgement he might have made, concealed feelings of partiality, etc."

  38,26,"[We said], \"O David, indeed We have made you a successor upon the earth, so judge between the people in truth and do not follow [your own] desire, as it will lead you astray from the way of Allāh.\" Indeed, those who go astray from the way of Allāh will have a severe punishment for having forgotten the Day of Account.",""
