quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  31,12,"And We had certainly given Luqmān wisdom [and said], \"Be grateful to Allāh.\" And whoever is grateful is grateful for [the benefit of] himself. And whoever denies [His favor] - then indeed, Allāh is Free of need and Praiseworthy.",""
  31,13,"And [mention, O Muḥammad], when Luqmān said to his son while he was instructing him, \"O my son, do not associate [anything] with Allāh. Indeed, association [with Him] is great injustice.\"",""
  31,14,"And We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents. His mother carried him, [increasing her] in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years. Be grateful to Me and to your parents; to Me is the [final] destination.",""
  31,15,"But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge,[1] do not obey them but accompany them in [this] world with appropriate kindness and follow the way of those who turn back to Me [in repentance]. Then to Me will be your return, and I will inform you about what you used to do.","[1] See footnote to 29:8."
  31,16,"[And Luqmān said], \"O my son, indeed if it [i.e., a wrong] should be the weight of a mustard seed and should be within a rock or [anywhere] in the heavens or in the earth, Allāh will bring it forth. Indeed, Allāh is Subtle[1] and Aware.","[1] Refer to footnote of 6:103."
  31,17,"O my son, establish prayer, enjoin what is right, forbid what is wrong, and be patient over what befalls you. Indeed, [all] that is of the matters [requiring] resolve.[1]","[1] For the reason that they are enjoined by Allāh."
  31,18,"And do not turn your cheek [in contempt] toward people[1] and do not walk through the earth exultantly. Indeed, Allāh does not like everyone self-deluded and boastful.","[1] Rather, respect them by directing your face and attention to them."
  31,19,"And be moderate in your pace and lower your voice; indeed, the most disagreeable of sounds is the voice of donkeys.\"",""
