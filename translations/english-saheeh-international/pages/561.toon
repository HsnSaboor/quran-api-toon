  66,8,"O you who have believed, repent to Allāh with sincere repentance. Perhaps[1] your Lord will remove from you your misdeeds and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow [on] the Day when Allāh will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believed with him. Their light will proceed before them and on their right; they will say, \"Our Lord, perfect for us our light and forgive us. Indeed, You are over all things competent.\"","[1] i.e., it is expected or promised."
