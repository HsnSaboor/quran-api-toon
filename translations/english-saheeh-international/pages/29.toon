quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,187,"It has been made permissible for you the night preceding fasting to go to your wives [for sexual relations]. They are a clothing for you and you are a clothing[1] for them. Allāh knows that you used to deceive yourselves,[2] so He accepted your repentance and forgave you. So now, have relations with them and seek that which Allāh has decreed for you [i.e., offspring]. And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct to you from the black thread [of night]. Then complete the fast until the night [i.e., sunset]. And do not have relations with them as long as you are staying for worship in the mosques. These are the limits [set by] Allāh, so do not approach them. Thus does Allāh make clear His verses [i.e., ordinances] to the people that they may become righteous.","[1] Also a source of tranquility and rest.\n[2] Prior to this revelation, marital relations were unlawful during nights preceding fasting. Some were unable to refrain and secretly disobeyed, but they did not deceive Allāh."
  2,188,"And do not consume one another's wealth unjustly or send it [in bribery] to the rulers in order that [they might aid] you [to] consume a portion of the wealth of the people in sin, while you know [it is unlawful].",""
  2,189,"They ask you, [O Muḥammad], about the crescent moons. Say, \"They are measurements of time for the people and for ḥajj [pilgrimage].\" And it is not righteousness to enter houses from the back, but righteousness is [in] one who fears Allāh. And enter houses from their doors. And fear Allāh that you may succeed.",""
  2,190,"Fight in the way of Allāh those who fight against you but do not transgress. Indeed, Allāh does not like transgressors.",""
