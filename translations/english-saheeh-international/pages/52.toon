quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,16,"Those who say, 'Our Lord, indeed we have believed, so forgive us our sins and protect us from the punishment of the Fire,' \"",""
  3,17,"The patient, the true, the obedient, those who spend [in the way of Allāh], and those who seek forgiveness before dawn.",""
  3,18,"Allāh witnesses that there is no deity except Him, and [so do] the angels and those of knowledge - [that He is] maintaining [creation] in justice. There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.",""
  3,19,"Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allāh is Islām. And those who were given the Scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them - out of jealous animosity between themselves. And whoever disbelieves in the verses of Allāh, then indeed, Allāh is swift in [taking] account.",""
  3,20,"So if they argue with you, say, \"I have submitted myself to Allāh [in Islām], and [so have] those who follow me.\" And say to those who were given the Scripture and [to] the unlearned,[1] \"Have you submitted yourselves?\" And if they submit [in Islām], they are rightly guided; but if they turn away - then upon you is only the [duty of] notification. And Allāh is Seeing of [His] servants.","[1] Those who had no scripture (i.e., the pagans)."
  3,21,"Those who disbelieve in the signs of Allāh and kill the prophets without right and kill those who order justice from among the people - give them tidings of a painful punishment.",""
  3,22,"They are the ones whose deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter, and for them there will be no helpers.",""
