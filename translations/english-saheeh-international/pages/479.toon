quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  41,21,"And they will say to their skins, \"Why have you testified against us?\" They will say, \"We were made to speak by Allāh, who has made everything speak; and He created you the first time, and to Him you are returned.",""
  41,22,"And you were not covering [i.e., protecting] yourselves,[1] lest your hearing testify against you or your sight or your skins, but you assumed that Allāh does not know much of what you do.","[1] With righteousness or by fearing Allāh."
  41,23,"And that was your assumption which you assumed about your Lord. It has brought you to ruin, and you have become among the losers.\"",""
  41,24,"So [even] if they are patient, the Fire is a residence for them; and if they ask to appease [Allāh], they will not be of those who are allowed to appease.",""
  41,25,"And We appointed for them companions[1] who made attractive to them what was before them and what was behind them [of sin], and the word [i.e., decree] has come into effect upon them among nations which had passed on before them of jinn and men. Indeed, they [all] were losers.","[1] In this world among the evil jinn and men."
  41,26,"And those who disbelieve say, \"Do not listen to this Qur’ān and speak noisily[1] during [the recitation of] it that perhaps you will overcome.\"","[1] Other meanings include \"speak improperly\" and/or \"make a clamor.\" The purpose of this was to prevent the hearing or understanding of the Qur’ān."
  41,27,"But We will surely cause those who disbelieve to taste a severe punishment, and We will surely recompense them for the worst of what they had been doing.",""
  41,28,"That is the recompense of the enemies of Allāh - the Fire. For them therein is the home of eternity as recompense for what they, of Our verses, were rejecting.",""
  41,29,"And those who disbelieved will [then] say, \"Our Lord, show us those who misled us of the jinn and men [so] we may put them under our feet[1] that they will be among the lowest.\"","[1] In the lowest depths of Hell. Or \"that we may step on them\" in revenge."
