quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,40,"And [mention] the Day when He will gather them all and then say to the angels, \"Did these [people] used to worship you?\""
  34,41,"They will say, \"Exalted are You! You, [O Allāh], are our benefactor excluding [i.e., not] them. Rather, they used to worship the jinn; most of them were believers in them.\""
  34,42,"But today [i.e., the Day of Judgement] you do not hold for one another [the power of] benefit or harm, and We will say to those who wronged, \"Taste the punishment of the Fire, which you used to deny.\""
  34,43,"And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, they say, \"This is not but a man who wishes to avert you from that which your fathers were worshipping.\" And they say, \"This is not except a lie invented.\" And those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them, \"This is not but obvious magic.\""
  34,44,"And We had not given them any scriptures which they could study, and We had not sent to them before you, [O Muḥammad], any warner."
  34,45,"And those before them denied, and they [i.e., the people of Makkah] have not attained a tenth of what We had given them. But they [i.e., the former peoples] denied My messengers, so how [terrible] was My reproach."
  34,46,"Say, \"I only advise you of one [thing] - that you stand for Allāh, [seeking truth] in pairs and individually, and then give thought.\" There is not in your companion any madness. He is only a warner to you before a severe punishment."
  34,47,"Say, \"Whatever payment I might have asked of you - it is yours. My payment is only from Allāh, and He is, over all things, Witness.\""
  34,48,"Say, \"Indeed, my Lord projects the truth, Knower of the unseen.\""
