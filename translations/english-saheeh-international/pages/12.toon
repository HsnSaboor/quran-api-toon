quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,77,"But do they not know that Allāh knows what they conceal and what they declare?",""
  2,78,"And among them are unlettered ones who do not know the Scripture except [indulgement in] wishful thinking, but they are only assuming.",""
  2,79,"So woe[1] to those who write the \"scripture\" with their own hands, then say, \"This is from Allāh,\" in order to exchange it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.","[1] i.e., death and destruction."
  2,80,"And they say, \"Never will the Fire touch us, except for [a few] numbered days.\" Say, \"Have you taken a covenant with Allāh? For Allāh will never break His covenant. Or do you say about Allāh that which you do not know?\"",""
  2,81,"Yes, [on the contrary], whoever earns evil and his sin has encompassed him - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.",""
  2,82,"But they who believe and do righteous deeds - those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.",""
  2,83,"And [recall] when We took the covenant from the Children of Israel, [enjoining upon them], \"Do not worship except Allāh; and to parents do good and to relatives, orphans, and the needy. And speak to people good [words] and establish prayer and give zakāh.\" Then you turned away, except a few of you, and you were refusing.",""
