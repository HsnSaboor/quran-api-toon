  29,7,"And those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will surely remove from them their misdeeds and will surely reward them according to the best of what they used to do.",""
  29,8,"And We have enjoined upon man goodness to parents. But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge,[1] do not obey them. To Me is your return, and I will inform you about what you used to do.","[1] i.e., no knowledge of its divinity. There can be no knowledge about something which is non-existent or untrue."
  29,9,"And those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will surely admit them among the righteous [into Paradise].",""
  29,10,"And of the people are some who say, \"We believe in Allāh,\" but when one [of them] is harmed for [the cause of] Allāh, he considers the trial [i.e., harm] of the people as [if it were] the punishment of Allāh. But if victory comes from your Lord, they say, \"Indeed, We were with you.\" Is not Allāh most knowing of what is within the breasts of the worlds [i.e., all creatures]?",""
  29,11,"And Allāh will surely make evident those who believe, and He will surely make evident the hypocrites.",""
  29,12,"And those who disbelieve say to those who believe, \"Follow our way, and we will carry your sins.\"[1] But they will not carry anything of their sins. Indeed, they are liars.","[1] The phrase may also read: \"and let us carry your sins,\" i.e., the responsibility for your sins."
  29,13,"But they will surely carry their [own] burdens and [other] burdens along with their burdens,[1] and they will surely be questioned on the Day of Resurrection about what they used to invent.","[1] Besides their own sins, they will carry those of the people they misled, although it will not lessen the burden of the latter."
  29,14,"And We certainly sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them a thousand years minus fifty years, and the flood seized them while they were wrongdoers.",""
