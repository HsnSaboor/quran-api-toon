quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  60,6,"There has certainly been for you in them an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allāh and the Last Day. And whoever turns away - then indeed, Allāh is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.",""
  60,7,"Perhaps Allāh will put, between you and those to whom you have been enemies among them, affection. And Allāh is competent,[1] and Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.","[1] To accomplish this or whatever He should will."
  60,8,"Allāh does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allāh loves those who act justly.",""
  60,9,"Allāh only forbids you from those who fight you because of religion and expel you from your homes and aid in your expulsion - [forbids] that you make allies[1] of them. And whoever makes allies of them, then it is those who are the wrongdoers.","[1] See footnote to verse 1 of this sūrah."
  60,10,"O you who have believed, when the believing women come to you as emigrants, examine [i.e., test] them. Allāh is most knowing as to their faith. And if you know them to be believers, then do not return them to the disbelievers; they are not lawful [wives] for them, nor are they lawful [husbands] for them. But give them [i.e., the disbelievers] what they have spent.[1] And there is no blame upon you if you marry them when you have given them their due compensation [i.e., mahr]. And hold not to marriage bonds with disbelieving women, but ask for what you have spent and let them [i.e., the disbelievers] ask for what they have spent.[2] That is the judgement of Allāh; He judges between you. And Allāh is Knowing and Wise.","[1] For marriage, i.e., compensate their loss.\n[2] When a disbelieving wife chose to join the disbelievers, a Muslim husband could demand in return the equivalent of her mahr. Likewise, the disbelievers had a similar right when a believing woman joined the Muslims. This and the following verses were revealed subsequent to the Treaty of al-Ḥudaybiyyah."
  60,11,"And if you have lost any of your wives to the disbelievers and you subsequently obtain [something],[1] then give those whose wives have gone the equivalent of what they had spent. And fear Allāh, in whom you are believers.","[1] From the side of the disbelievers, i.e., war booty or a believing woman seeking refuge with the Muslims."
