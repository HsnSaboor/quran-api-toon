  21,36,"And when those who disbelieve see you, [O Muḥammad], they take you not except in ridicule, [saying], \"Is this the one who mentions [i.e., insults] your gods?\" And they are, at the mention of the Most Merciful, disbelievers.",""
  21,37,"Man was created of haste [i.e., impatience]. I will show you My signs [i.e., vengeance], so do not impatiently urge Me.",""
  21,38,"And they say, \"When is this promise, if you should be truthful?\"",""
  21,39,"If those who disbelieved but knew the time when they will not avert the Fire from their faces or from their backs and they will not be aided...[1]","[1] The completion of the sentence is understood to be \"...they would not be asking in disbelief and ridicule to be shown the punishment.\""
  21,40,"Rather, it will come to them unexpectedly and bewilder them, and they will not be able to repel it, nor will they be reprieved.",""

  21,44,"But, [on the contrary], We have provided good things for these [disbelievers] and their fathers until life was prolonged for them. Then do they not see that We set upon the land, reducing it from its borders?[1] Is it they who will overcome?","[1] See footnote to 13:41."
