quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,30,"And [mention, O Muḥammad], when your Lord said to the angels, \"Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.\"[1] They said, \"Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we exalt You with praise and declare Your perfection?\"[2] He [Allāh] said, \"Indeed, I know that which you do not know.\"","[1] Khalīfah: successor, or generations of man, one following another.\n[2] An additional meaning is \"...and we purify ourselves for You.\""
  2,31,"And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, \"Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful.\"",""
  2,32,"They said, \"Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing,[1] the Wise.\"[2]","[1] Whose eternal and absolute knowledge encompasses the truth and essence of all things, seen or unseen, present or absent, neither preceded by ignorance nor followed by forgetfulness.\n[2] Whose wisdom includes precise and perfect knowledge of all realities and outcomes, according to which He decrees and causes various circumstances and occurrences."
  2,33,"He said, \"O Adam, inform them of their names.\" And when he had informed them of their names, He said, \"Did I not tell you that I know the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth? And I know what you reveal and what you have concealed.\"",""
  2,34,"And [mention] when We said to the angels, \"Prostrate before Adam\"; so they prostrated, except for Iblees.[1] He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.","[1] The proper name of Satan, who was not an angel but from the jinn, as stated in 18:50. Done in obedience to Allāh, this prostration was one of respect, not worship."
  2,35,"And We said, \"O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.\"",""
  2,36,"But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that [condition] in which they had been. And We said, \"Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one another, and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time.\"",""
  2,37,"Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words,[1] and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of Repentance,[2] the Merciful.","[1] Allāh taught Adam words of repentance that would be acceptable to Him.\n[2] Literally, He who perpetually returns, i.e., reminding and enabling His servant to repent from sins and then forgiving him. Thus, He is also the constant motivator of the repentance He accepts."
