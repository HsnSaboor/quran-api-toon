quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,95,"Not equal are those believers remaining [at home] - other than the disabled - and the mujāhideen, [who strive and fight] in the cause of Allāh with their wealth and their lives. Allāh has preferred the mujāhideen through their wealth and their lives over those who remain [behind], by degrees. And to all [i.e., both] Allāh has promised the best [reward]. But Allāh has preferred the mujāhideen over those who remain [behind] with a great reward -",""
  4,96,"Degrees [of high position] from Him and forgiveness and mercy. And Allāh is ever Forgiving and Merciful.",""
  4,97,"Indeed, those whom the angels take [in death] while wronging themselves[1] - [the angels] will say, \"In what [condition] were you?\" They will say, \"We were oppressed in the land.\" They [the angels] will say, \"Was not the earth of Allāh spacious [enough] for you to emigrate therein?\" For those, their refuge is Hell - and evil it is as a destination.","[1] By preferring to remain among the disbelievers, although they have the means to emigrate, in an environment where a Muslim is unable to practice his religion freely."
  4,98,"Except for the oppressed among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they directed to a way[1] -","[1] They are prevented by circumstances beyond their control."
  4,99,"For those it is expected that Allāh will pardon them, and Allāh is ever Pardoning[1] and Forgiving.","[1] Refer to footnote in 4:43."
  4,100,"And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allāh will find on the earth many [alternative] locations and abundance. And whoever leaves his home as an emigrant to Allāh and His Messenger and then death overtakes him - his reward has already become incumbent upon Allāh. And Allāh is ever Forgiving and Merciful.",""
  4,101,"And when you travel throughout the land, there is no blame upon you for shortening the prayer,[1] [especially] if you fear that those who disbelieve may disrupt [or attack] you.[2] Indeed, the disbelievers are ever to you a clear enemy.","[1] The four rakʿah prayers are shortened to two rakʿahs.\n[2] The example of the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions illustrates that fear is not a condition for this allowance, merely travel."
