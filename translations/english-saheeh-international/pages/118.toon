quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,58,"And when you call to prayer, they take it in ridicule and amusement. That is because they are a people who do not use reason.",""
  5,59,"Say, \"O People of the Scripture, do you resent us except [for the fact] that we have believed in Allāh and what was revealed to us and what was revealed before and because most of you are defiantly disobedient?\"",""
  5,60,"Say, \"Shall I inform you of [what is] worse than that[1] as penalty from Allāh? [It is that of] those whom Allāh has cursed and with whom He became angry and made of them apes and pigs and slaves of ṭāghūt.[2] Those are worse in position and further astray from the sound way.\"","[1] Referring to the punishment the People of the Scripture (in their censure of the Muslims) claimed was deserved by them.\n[2] See footnote to 2:256."
  5,61,"And when they come to you, they say, \"We believe.\" But they have entered with disbelief [in their hearts], and they have certainly left with it. And Allāh is most knowing of what they were concealing.",""
  5,62,"And you see many of them hastening into sin and aggression and the devouring of [what is] unlawful. How wretched is what they have been doing.",""
  5,63,"Why do the rabbis and religious scholars not forbid them from saying what is sinful and devouring what is unlawful? How wretched is what they have been practicing.",""
  5,64,"And the Jews say, \"The hand of Allāh is chained.\"[1] Chained are their hands, and cursed are they for what they say. Rather, both His hands are extended; He spends however He wills. And that which has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief. And We have cast among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war [against you], Allāh extinguished it. And they strive throughout the land [causing] corruption, and Allāh does not like corrupters.","[1] Implying inability to give or stinginess."
