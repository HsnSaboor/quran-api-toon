quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,138,"And We took the Children of Israel across the sea; then they came upon a people intent in devotion to [some] idols of theirs. They [the Children of Israel] said, \"O Moses, make for us a god just as they have gods.\" He said, \"Indeed, you are a people behaving ignorantly.",""
  7,139,"Indeed, those [worshippers] - destroyed is that in which they are [engaged], and worthless is whatever they were doing.\"",""
  7,140,"He said, \"Is it other than Allāh I should desire for you as a god[1] while He has preferred you over the worlds?\"","[1] An object of worship."
  7,141,"And [recall, O Children of Israel], when We saved you from the people of Pharaoh, [who were] afflicting you with the worst torment - killing your sons and keeping your women alive. And in that was a great trial from your Lord.",""
  7,142,"And We made an appointment with Moses for thirty nights and perfected them by [the addition of] ten; so the term of his Lord was completed as forty nights. And Moses said to his brother Aaron, \"Take my place among my people, do right [by them],[1] and do not follow the way of the corrupters.\"","[1] i.e., keep their affairs in order."
  7,143,"And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, \"My Lord, show me [Yourself] that I may look at You.\" [Allāh] said, \"You will not see Me,[1] but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place, then you will see Me.\" But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He rendered it level,[2] and Moses fell unconscious. And when he awoke, he said, \"Exalted are You! I have repented to You, and I am the first [among my people] of the believers.\"[3]","[1] That no one can see Allāh during the life of this world.\n[2] It crumbled to dust."
