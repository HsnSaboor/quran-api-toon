quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,"And O my people, I ask not of you for it any wealth. My reward is not but from Allāh. And I am not one to drive away those who have believed. Indeed, they will meet their Lord, but I see that you are a people behaving ignorantly."
  11,30,"And O my people, who would protect me from Allāh if I drove them away? Then will you not be reminded?"
  11,31,"And I do not tell you that I have the depositories [containing the provision] of Allāh or that I know the unseen, nor do I tell you that I am an angel, nor do I say of those upon whom your eyes look down that Allāh will never grant them any good. Allāh is most knowing of what is within their souls. Indeed, I would then be among the wrongdoers [i.e., the unjust].\""
  11,32,"They said, \"O Noah, you have disputed [i.e., opposed] us and been frequent in dispute of us. So bring us what you threaten us, if you should be of the truthful.\""
  11,33,"He said, \"Allāh will only bring it to you if He wills, and you will not cause [Him] failure."
  11,34,"And my advice will not benefit you - although I wished to advise you - if Allāh should intend to put you in error. He is your Lord, and to Him you will be returned.\""
  11,35,"Or do they say [about Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ)], \"He invented it\"? Say, \"If I have invented it, then upon me is [the consequence of] my crime; but I am innocent of what [crimes] you commit.\""
  11,36,"And it was revealed to Noah that, \"No one will believe from your people except those who have already believed, so do not be distressed by what they have been doing."
  11,37,"And construct the ship under Our observation and Our inspiration and do not address Me concerning those who have wronged; indeed, they are [to be] drowned.\""
