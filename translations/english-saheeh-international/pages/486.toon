quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  42,23,"It is that of which Allāh gives good tidings to His servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say, [O Muḥammad], \"I do not ask you for it [i.e., this message] any payment [but] only good will through [i.e., due to] kinship.\" And whoever commits a good deed - We will increase for him good therein. Indeed, Allāh is Forgiving and Appreciative.[1]","[1] See footnote in 35:30."
  42,24,"Or do they say, \"He has invented about Allāh a lie\"? But if Allāh willed, He could seal over your heart.[1] And Allāh eliminates falsehood and establishes the truth by His words. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.","[1] i.e., He could make you forget the Qur’ān and deprive you of it."
  42,25,"And it is He who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons misdeeds, and He knows what you do.",""
  42,26,"And He answers [the supplication of] those who have believed and done righteous deeds and increases [for] them from His bounty. But the disbelievers will have a severe punishment.",""
  42,27,"And if Allāh had extended [excessively] provision for His servants, they would have committed tyranny throughout the earth. But He sends [it] down in an amount which He wills. Indeed He is, of His servants, Aware and Seeing.",""
  42,28,"And it is He who sends down the rain after they had despaired and spreads His mercy. And He is the Protector, the Praiseworthy.",""
  42,29,"And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and what He has dispersed throughout them of creatures. And He, for gathering them when He wills, is competent.",""
  42,30,"And whatever strikes you of disaster - it is for what your hands have earned; but He pardons much.",""
  42,31,"And you will not cause failure [to Allāh][1] upon the earth. And you have not besides Allāh any protector or helper.","[1] i.e., escape from Him."
