quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,17,"Their example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, Allāh took away their light and left them in darkness [so] they could not see.",""
  2,18,"Deaf, dumb and blind - so they will not return [to the right path].",""
  2,19,"Or [it is] like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness, thunder and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death. But Allāh is encompassing[1] of the disbelievers.","[1] Allāh states in the Qur’ān that He has certain attributes such as hearing, sight, hands, face, mercy, anger, coming, encompassing, being above the Throne, etc. Yet, He has disassociated Himself from the limitations of human attributes or human imagination. Correct Islāmic belief requires faith in the existence of these attributes as Allāh has described them without applying to them any allegorical meanings or attempting to explain how a certain quality could be (while this is known only to Allāh) and without comparing them to creation or denying that He (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) would have such a quality. His attributes are befitting to Him alone, and \"There is nothing like unto Him.\" (42:11)"
  2,20,"The lightning almost snatches away their sight. Every time it lights [the way] for them, they walk therein; but when darkness comes over them, they stand [still]. And if Allāh had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allāh is over all things competent.",""
  2,21,"O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous -",""
  2,22,"[He] who made for you the earth a bed [spread out] and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky, rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you. So do not attribute to Allāh equals while you know [that there is nothing similar to Him].",""
  2,23,"And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down [i.e., the Qur’ān] upon Our Servant [i.e., Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ)], then produce a sūrah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses [i.e., supporters] other than Allāh, if you should be truthful.",""
  2,24,"But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then fear the Fire, whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.",""
