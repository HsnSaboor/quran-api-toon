  10,1,"Alif, Lām, Rā.[1] These are the verses of the wise[2] Book.","[1] See footnote to 2:1.\n[2] The adjective \"wise\" expresses the qualities of will, purpose, discrimination and precision."
  10,2,"Have the people been amazed that We revealed [revelation] to a man from among them, [saying], \"Warn mankind and give good tidings to those who believe that they will have a [firm] precedence of honor[1] with their Lord\"? [But] the disbelievers say, \"Indeed, this is an obvious magician.\"","[1] i.e., a sure position due to their righteous deeds."
  10,3,"Indeed, your Lord is Allāh, who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne,[1] arranging the matter [of His creation]. There is no intercessor except after His permission. That is Allāh, your Lord, so worship Him. Then will you not remember?","[1] See footnotes to 2:19 and 7:54."
  10,4,"To Him is your return all together. [It is] the promise of Allāh [which is] truth. Indeed, He begins the [process of] creation and then repeats it that He may reward those who have believed and done righteous deeds, in justice. But those who disbelieved will have a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment for what they used to deny.",""
  10,5,"It is He who made the sun a shining light and the moon a derived light and determined for it phases - that you may know the number of years and account [of time]. Allāh has not created this except in truth. He details the signs for a people who know.",""
  10,6,"Indeed, in the alternation of the night and the day and [in] what Allāh has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for a people who fear Allāh.",""
