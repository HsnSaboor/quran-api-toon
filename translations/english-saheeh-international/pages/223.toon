quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  11,13,"Or do they say, \"He invented it\"? Say, \"Then bring ten sūrahs like it that have been invented and call upon [for assistance] whomever you can besides Allāh, if you should be truthful.\"",""
  11,14,"And if they do not respond to you - then know that it [i.e., the Qur’ān] was revealed with the knowledge of Allāh[1] and that there is no deity except Him. Then,[2] would you [not] be Muslims?","[1] i.e., that knowledge which no one possesses except Him (subḥānahu wa taʿālā).\n[2] After having been convinced by such evidence."
  11,15,"Whoever desires the life of this world and its adornments - We fully repay them for their deeds therein,[1] and they therein will not be deprived.","[1] i.e., during worldly life."
  11,16,"Those are the ones for whom there is not in the Hereafter but the Fire. And lost is what they did therein,[1] and worthless is what they used to do.","[1] i.e., during worldly life."
  11,17,"So is one who [stands] upon a clear evidence from his Lord [like the aforementioned]? And a witness[1] from Him follows it,[2] and before it was the Scripture of Moses to lead and as mercy. Those [believers in the former revelations] believe in it [i.e., the Qur’ān]. But whoever disbelieves in it from the [various] factions - the Fire is his promised destination. So be not in doubt about it. Indeed, it is the truth from your Lord, but most of the people do not believe.","[1] Referring to Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ) or to the angel Gabriel.\n[2] Testifying to its truth. Additionally, it can mean \"recites it,\" i.e., the Qur’ān."
  11,18,"And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about Allāh? Those will be presented before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, \"These are the ones who lied against their Lord.\" Unquestionably, the curse of Allāh is upon the wrongdoers",""
  11,19,"Who averted [people] from the way of Allāh and sought to make it [seem] deviant while they, concerning the Hereafter, were disbelievers.",""
