quran[10]{c,v,t,f}:
  24,11,"Indeed, those who came with falsehood[1] are a group among you. Do not think it bad for you; rather, it is good for you. For every person among them is what [punishment] he has earned from the sin, and he who took upon himself the greater portion thereof[2] - for him is a great punishment [i.e., Hellfire].","[1] Referring to the incident when the Prophet's wife ʿĀ’ishah was falsely accused by the hypocrites.\n[2] i.e., ʿAbdullāh bin ʿUbayy, leader of the hypocrites."
  24,12,"Why, when you heard it, did not the believing men and believing women think good of themselves [i.e., one another] and say, \"This is an obvious falsehood\"?",""
  24,13,"Why did they [who slandered] not produce for it four witnesses? And when they do not produce the witnesses, then it is they, in the sight of Allāh, who are the liars.",""
  24,14,"And if it had not been for the favor of Allāh upon you and His mercy in this world and the Hereafter, you would have been touched for that [lie] in which you were involved by a great punishment",""
  24,15,"When you received it with your tongues[1] and said with your mouths that of which you had no knowledge and thought it was insignificant while it was, in the sight of Allāh, tremendous.","[1] Rather than your ears, i.e., not thinking about what you had heard but hastening to repeat it carelessly."
  24,16,"And why, when you heard it, did you not say, \"It is not for us to speak of this. Exalted are You, [O Allāh]; this is a great slander\"?",""
  24,17,"Allāh warns you against returning to the likes of this [conduct], ever, if you should be believers.",""
  24,18,"And Allāh makes clear to you the verses [i.e., His rulings], and Allāh is Knowing and Wise.",""
  24,19,"Indeed, those who like that immorality[1] should be spread [or publicized] among those who have believed will have a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. And Allāh knows[2] and you do not know.","[1] Specifically, unlawful sexual relations.\n[2] The hidden aspects of all things: what is beneficial and what is harmful."
  24,20,"And if it had not been for the favor of Allāh upon you and His mercy...[1] and because Allāh is Kind and Merciful.","[1] See footnote to verse 10."
