  2,217,"They ask you about the sacred month[1] - about fighting therein. Say, \"Fighting therein is great [sin], but averting [people] from the way of Allāh and disbelief in Him and [preventing access to] al-Masjid al-Ḥarām and the expulsion of its people therefrom are greater [evil] in the sight of Allāh. And fitnah[2] is greater than killing.\" And they will continue to fight you until they turn you back from your religion if they are able. And whoever of you reverts from his religion [to disbelief] and dies while he is a disbeliever - for those, their deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter, and those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.","[1] See footnote to 2:194.\n[2] See footnote to 2:191."
  2,218,"Indeed, those who have believed and those who have emigrated and fought in the cause of Allāh - those expect the mercy of Allāh. And Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.",""
  2,219,"They ask you about wine[1] and gambling. Say, \"In them is great sin and [yet, some] benefit for people. But their sin is greater than their benefit.\" And they ask you what they should spend. Say, \"The excess [beyond needs].\" Thus Allāh makes clear to you the verses [of revelation] that you might give thought","[1] The word \"khamr\" (wine) includes all intoxicants. The final prohibition is given in 5:90-91."
