quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,45,"So the people that committed wrong were eliminated. And praise to Allāh, Lord of the worlds.",""
  6,46,"Say, \"Have you considered:[1] if Allāh should take away your hearing and your sight and set a seal upon your hearts, which deity other than Allāh could bring them [back] to you?\" Look how We diversify[2] the verses; then they [still] turn away.","[1] See footnote to verse 40.\n[2] Repeat in various ways for emphasis and clarification."
  6,47,"Say, \"Have you considered: if the punishment of Allāh should come to you unexpectedly or manifestly,[1] will any be destroyed but the wrongdoing people?\"","[1] i.e., before your eyes."
  6,48,"And We send not the messengers except as bringers of good tidings and warners. So whoever believes and reforms - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.",""
  6,49,"But those who deny Our verses - the punishment will touch[1] them for their defiant disobedience.","[1] i.e., reach and afflict."
  6,50,"Say, [O Muḥammad], \"I do not tell you that I have the depositories [containing the provision] of Allāh or that I know the unseen, nor do I tell you that I am an angel. I only follow what is revealed to me.\" Say, \"Is the blind equivalent to the seeing? Then will you not give thought?\"",""
  6,51,"And warn by it [i.e., the Qur’ān] those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord - for them besides Him will be no protector and no intercessor - that they might become righteous.",""
  6,52,"And do not send away those who call upon their Lord morning and afternoon, seeking His face [i.e., favor]. Not upon you is anything of their account and not upon them is anything of your account.[1] So were you to send them away, you would [then] be of the wrongdoers.","[1] No one is held accountable for the deeds or intentions of another. That is left to Allāh's judgement."
