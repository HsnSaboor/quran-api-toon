quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,91,"And they did not appraise Allāh with true appraisal[1] when they said, \"Allāh did not reveal to a human being anything.\" Say, \"Who revealed the Scripture that Moses brought as light and guidance to the people? You [Jews] make it into pages, disclosing [some of] it and concealing much. And you[2] were taught that which you knew not - neither you nor your fathers.\" Say, \"Allāh [revealed it].\" Then leave them in their [empty] discourse, amusing themselves.","[1] i.e., they did not appreciate the extent of His ability and wisdom.\n[2] The Jews, or it may refer to the believers, who are taught by the Qur’ān."
  6,92,"And this is a Book which We have sent down, blessed and confirming what was before it, that you may warn the Mother of Cities [i.e., Makkah] and those around it.[1] Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they are maintaining their prayers.","[1] i.e., all other peoples."
  6,93,"And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allāh or says, \"It has been inspired to me,\" while nothing has been inspired to him, and one who says, \"I will reveal [something] like what Allāh revealed.\" And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the overwhelming pangs of death while the angels extend their hands,[1] [saying], \"Discharge your souls! Today you will be awarded the punishment of [extreme] humiliation for what you used to say against Allāh other than the truth and [that] you were, toward His verses, being arrogant.\"","[1] Striking them, as they are unwilling to give up their souls for judgement."
  6,94,"[It will be said to them], \"And you have certainly come to Us alone [i.e., individually] as We created you the first time, and you have left whatever We bestowed upon you behind you. And We do not see with you your 'intercessors' which you claimed that they were among you associates [of Allāh]. It has [all] been severed between you,[1] and lost from you is what you used to claim.\"","[1] Between yourselves and the claimed associates and intercessors."
