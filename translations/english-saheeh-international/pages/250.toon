quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  13,6,"They impatiently urge you to bring about evil before good,[1] while there has already occurred before them similar punishments [to what they demand]. And indeed, your Lord is the possessor of forgiveness for the people despite their wrongdoing, and indeed, your Lord is severe in penalty.","[1] They said, challenging the Prophet (ﷺ) in ridicule, \"Bring on the punishment, if you are truthful,\" rather than asking for mercy and forgiveness from Allāh."
  13,7,"And those who disbelieved say, \"Why has a sign not been sent down to him from his Lord?\" You are only a warner, and for every people is a guide.",""
  13,8,"Allāh knows what every female carries[1] and what the wombs lose [prematurely] or exceed.[2] And everything with Him is by due measure.","[1] With absolute knowledge inclusive of every aspect of the fetus' existence.\n[2] Beyond their normal period of pregnancy and/or the number of fetuses therein."

  13,11,"For him [i.e., each one] are successive [angels][1] before and behind him who protect him by the decree of Allāh.[2] Indeed, Allāh will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves. And when Allāh intends for a people ill,[3] there is no repelling it. And there is not for them besides Him any patron.","[1] Replacing each other by turn.\n[2] The phrase may also be rendered \"...who guard him from [everything except] the decree of Allāh.\"\n[3] i.e., punishment or destruction because of their sins."
  13,12,"It is He who shows you lightning, [causing] fear and aspiration, and generates the heavy clouds.",""
