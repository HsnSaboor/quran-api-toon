  36,41,"And a sign for them is that We carried their forefathers[1] in a laden ship.","[1] Usually meaning \"descendants\" or \"offspring,\" the word \"dhurriyyah\" is used here to denote forefathers (their being the offspring of Noah), who were saved from the flood."
  36,42,"And We created for them from the likes of it that which they ride.",""
  36,43,"And if We should will, We could drown them; then no one responding to a cry would there be for them, nor would they be saved",""
  36,44,"Except as a mercy from Us and provision for a time.",""
  36,45,"But when it is said to them, \"Beware of what is before you and what is behind you;[1] perhaps you will receive mercy...\"[2]","[1] Of sins or of life in this world and the Hereafter.\n[2] The conclusion of this sentence is understood to be \"...they ignored the warning.\""
  36,46,"And no sign comes to them from the signs of their Lord except that they are from it turning away.",""
  36,47,"And when it is said to them, \"Spend from that which Allāh has provided for you,\" those who disbelieve say to those who believe, \"Should we feed one whom, if Allāh had willed, He would have fed? You are not but in clear error.\"",""
  36,48,"And they say, \"When is this promise, if you should be truthful?\"",""
  36,49,"They do not await except one blast[1] which will seize them while they are disputing.","[1] Literally, \"cry\" or \"shriek,\" meaning the first blast of the Horn which will strike dead every living thing on the earth without warning."
  36,50,"And they will not be able [to give] any instruction, nor to their people can they return.",""
  36,51,"And the Horn will be blown;[1] and at once from the graves to their Lord they will hasten.","[1] For the second time, signaling the Resurrection."
  36,52,"They will say, \"O woe to us! Who has raised us up from our sleeping place?\" [The reply will be], \"This is what the Most Merciful had promised, and the messengers told the truth.\"",""
  36,53,"It will not be but one blast, and at once they are all brought present before Us.",""
