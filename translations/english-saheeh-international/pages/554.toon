quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  62,9,"O you who have believed, when [the adhān] is called for the prayer on the day of Jumuʿah [Friday], then proceed to the remembrance of Allāh and leave trade. That is better for you, if you only knew.",""
  62,10,"And when the prayer has been concluded, disperse within the land and seek from the bounty of Allāh, and remember Allāh often that you may succeed.",""
  62,11,"But [on one occasion] when they saw a transaction or a diversion, [O Muḥammad], they rushed to it and left you standing. Say, \"What is with Allāh is better than diversion and than a transaction, and Allāh is the best of providers.\"",""
  63,1,"When the hypocrites come to you, [O Muḥammad], they say, \"We testify that you are the Messenger of Allāh.\" And Allāh knows that you are His Messenger, and Allāh testifies that the hypocrites are liars.",""
  63,2,"They have taken their oaths as a cover, so they averted [people] from the way of Allāh. Indeed, it was evil that they were doing.",""
  63,3,"That is because they believed, and then they disbelieved; so their hearts were sealed over, and they do not understand.",""
  63,4,"And when you see them, their forms please you, and if they speak, you listen to their speech. [They are] as if they were pieces of wood propped up[1] - they think that every shout is against them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. May Allāh destroy them; how are they deluded?","[1] i.e., bodies with empty minds and empty hearts."
