quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  7,88,"Said the eminent ones who were arrogant among his people, \"We will surely evict you, O Shuʿayb, and those who have believed with you from our city, or you must return to our religion.\" He said, \"Even if we were unwilling?",""
  7,89,"We would have invented against Allāh a lie if we returned to your religion after Allāh had saved us from it. And it is not for us to return to it except that Allāh, our Lord, should will. Our Lord has encompassed all things in knowledge. Upon Allāh we have relied. Our Lord, decide between us and our people in truth, and You are the best of those who give decision.\"",""
  7,90,"Said the eminent ones who disbelieved among his people, \"If you should follow Shuʿayb, indeed, you would then be losers.\"",""
  7,91,"So the earthquake seized them, and they became within their home [corpses] fallen prone.",""
  7,92,"Those who denied Shuʿayb - it was as though they had never resided there. Those who denied Shuʿayb - it was they who were the losers.",""
  7,93,"And he [i.e., Shuʿayb] turned away from them and said, \"O my people, I had certainly conveyed to you the messages of my Lord and advised you, so how could I grieve for a disbelieving people?\"",""
  7,94,"And We sent to no city a prophet [who was denied] except that We seized its people with poverty and hardship that they might humble themselves [to Allāh].",""
  7,95,"Then We exchanged in place of the bad [condition], good, until they increased [and prospered] and said, \"Our fathers [also] were touched with hardship and ease.\"[1] So We seized them suddenly while they did not perceive.[2]","[1] Instead of being grateful to Allāh for His blessings, they merely attributed them to the changing fortunes of time.\n[2] That they had been tried and tested."
