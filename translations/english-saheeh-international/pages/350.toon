  24,1,"[This is] a sūrah which We have sent down and made [that within it] obligatory and revealed therein verses of clear evidence that you might remember.",""
  24,2,"The [unmarried] woman or [unmarried] man found guilty of sexual intercourse[1] - lash each one of them with a hundred lashes,[2] and do not be taken by pity for them in the religion [i.e., law] of Allāh,[3] if you should believe in Allāh and the Last Day. And let a group of the believers witness their punishment.","[1] Either by voluntary confession of the offender or the testimony of four male witnesses to having actually seen the act take place. Otherwise, there can be no conviction.\n[2] The ruling in this verse is applicable to unmarried fornicators. Execution by stoning is confirmed in the sunnah for convicted adulterers.\n[3] i.e., Do not let sympathy for a guilty person move you to alter anything ordained by Allāh, for in His law is protection of society as a whole."
  24,3,"The fornicator does not marry except a [female] fornicator or polytheist, and none marries her except a fornicator[1] or a polytheist, and that [i.e., marriage to such persons] has been made unlawful to the believers.","[1] Included in this ruling is the adulterer as well. Such persons cannot be married to believers unless they have repented and reformed."
  24,4,"And those who accuse chaste women and then do not produce four witnesses - lash them with eighty lashes and do not accept from them testimony ever after. And those are the defiantly disobedient,",""
  24,5,"Except for those who repent thereafter and reform, for indeed, Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.",""
  24,6,"And those who accuse their wives [of adultery] and have no witnesses except themselves - then the witness of one of them[1] [shall be] four testimonies [swearing] by Allāh that indeed, he is of the truthful.","[1] The husbands who have been betrayed."
  24,7,"And the fifth [oath will be] that the curse of Allāh be upon him if he should be of the liars.",""
  24,8,"But it will prevent punishment from her if she gives four testimonies [swearing] by Allāh that indeed, he is of the liars.",""
  24,9,"And the fifth [oath will be] that the wrath of Allāh be upon her if he was of the truthful.",""
  24,10,"And if not for the favor of Allāh upon you and His mercy...[1] and because Allāh is Accepting of Repentance and Wise.","[1] The phrase omitted is estimated to be \"...you would have surely been punished, destroyed or scandalized,\" or \"...you would have suffered many difficult situations.\""
