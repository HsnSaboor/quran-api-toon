quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  13,29,"Those who have believed and done righteous deeds - a good state is theirs and a good return.",""
  13,30,"Thus have We sent you to a community before which [other] communities have passed on so you might recite to them that which We revealed to you, while they disbelieve in the Most Merciful. Say, \"He is my Lord; there is no deity except Him. Upon Him I rely, and to Him is my return.\"",""
  13,31,"And if there was any Qur’ān [i.e., recitation] by which the mountains would be removed or the earth would be broken apart or the dead would be made to speak,[1] [it would be this Qur’ān], but to Allāh belongs the affair entirely. Then have those who believed not accepted that had Allāh willed, He would have guided the people, all of them? And those who disbelieve do not cease to be struck, for what they have done, by calamity - or it will descend near their home - until there comes the promise of Allāh. Indeed, Allāh does not fail in [His] promise.","[1] As suggested by the disbelievers."
  13,32,"And already were [other] messengers ridiculed before you, and I extended the time of those who disbelieved; then I seized them, and how [terrible] was My penalty.",""
  13,33,"Then is He who is a maintainer of every soul, [knowing] what it has earned, [like any other]? But to Allāh they have attributed partners. Say, \"Name them. Or do you inform Him of that[1] which He knows not upon the earth or of what is apparent [i.e., alleged] of speech?\"[2] Rather, their [own] plan has been made attractive to those who disbelieve, and they have been averted from the way. And whomever Allāh sends astray - there will be for him no guide.","[1] i.e., other \"deities.\"\n[2] i.e., your attributing of divinity to other than Allāh."
  13,34,"For them will be punishment in the life of [this] world, and the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe. And they will not have from Allāh any protector.",""
