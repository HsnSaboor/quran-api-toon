quran[4]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,283,"And if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a security deposit [should be] taken. And if one of you entrusts another, then let him who is entrusted discharge his trust [faithfully] and let him fear Allāh, his Lord. And do not conceal testimony, for whoever conceals it - his heart is indeed sinful, and Allāh is Knowing of what you do.",""
  2,284,"To Allāh belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Whether you show what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allāh will bring you to account for it. Then He will forgive whom He wills and punish whom He wills, and Allāh is over all things competent.",""
  2,285,"The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and [so have] the believers. All of them have believed in Allāh and His angels and His books and His messengers, [saying], \"We make no distinction between any of His messengers.\" And they say, \"We hear and we obey. [We seek] Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the [final] destination.\"",""
  2,286,"Allāh does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has earned. \"Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred. Our Lord, and lay not upon us a burden like that which You laid upon those before us. Our Lord, and burden us not with that which we have no ability to bear. And pardon us; and forgive us; and have mercy upon us. You are our protector, so give us victory over the disbelieving people.\"[1]","[1] Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) concludes this sūrah by directing His servants how to supplicate Him, just as He taught them in Sūrah al-Fātiḥah how to praise Him and ask for guidance."
