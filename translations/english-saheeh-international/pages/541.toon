quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  57,25,"We have already sent Our messengers with clear evidences and sent down with them the Scripture and the balance that the people may maintain [their affairs] in justice. And We sent down iron, wherein is great military might and benefits for the people, and so that Allāh may make evident those who support Him and His messengers unseen. Indeed, Allāh is Powerful and Exalted in Might.",""
  57,26,"And We have already sent Noah and Abraham and placed in their descendants prophethood and scripture; and among them is he who is guided, but many of them are defiantly disobedient.",""
  57,27,"Then We sent following their footsteps [i.e., traditions] Our messengers and followed [them] with Jesus, the son of Mary, and gave him the Gospel. And We placed in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and mercy and monasticism, which they innovated; We did not prescribe it for them except [that they did so] seeking the approval of Allāh. But they did not observe it with due observance. So We gave the ones who believed among them their reward, but many of them are defiantly disobedient.",""
  57,28,"O you who have believed, fear Allāh and believe in His Messenger; He will [then] give you a double portion of His mercy and make for you a light by which you will walk and forgive you; and Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.",""
  57,29,"[This is] so that the People of the Scripture may know that they are not able [to obtain] anything from the bounty of Allāh[1] and that [all] bounty is in the hand[2] of Allāh; He gives it to whom He wills. And Allāh is the possessor of great bounty.","[1] As long as they refuse to believe in the message of Allāh which was conveyed through Muḥammad (ﷺ).\n[2] See footnote to 2:19."
