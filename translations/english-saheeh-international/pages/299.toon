quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  18,46,"Wealth and children are [but] adornment of the worldly life. But the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord[1] for reward and better for [one's] hope.","[1] i.e., in His sight or evaluation."
  18,47,"And [warn of] the Day when We will remove the mountains and you will see the earth exposed,[1] and We will gather them and not leave behind from them anyone.","[1] i.e., flattened and bare."
  18,48,"And they will be presented before your Lord in rows, [and He will say], \"You have certainly come to Us just as We created you the first time. But you claimed that We would never make for you an appointment.\"",""
  18,49,"And the record [of deeds] will be placed [open], and you will see the criminals fearful of that within it, and they will say, \"Oh, woe to us! What is this book that leaves nothing small or great except that it has enumerated it?\" And they will find what they did present [before them]. And your Lord does injustice to no one.",""
  18,50,"And [mention] when We said to the angels, \"Prostrate to Adam,\" and they prostrated, except for Iblees. He was of the jinn and departed from [i.e., disobeyed] the command of his Lord. Then will you take him and his descendants as allies other than Me while they are enemies to you? Wretched it is for the wrongdoers as an exchange.",""
  18,51,"I did not make them witness to the creation of the heavens and the earth or to the creation of themselves, and I would not have taken the misguiders as assistants.",""
  18,52,"And [warn of] the Day when He will say, \"Call My 'partners' whom you claimed,\" and they will invoke them, but they will not respond to them. And We will put between them [a valley of] destruction.",""
  18,53,"And the criminals will see the Fire and will be certain that they are to fall therein. And they will not find from it a way elsewhere.",""
