quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,46,"And We sent, following in their footsteps,[1] Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light and confirming that which preceded it of the Torah as guidance and instruction for the righteous.","[1] i.e., following the tradition of the prophets of the Children of Israel."
  5,47,"And let the People of the Gospel judge by what Allāh has revealed therein. And whoever does not judge by what Allāh has revealed - then it is those who are the defiantly disobedient.",""
  5,48,"And We have revealed to you, [O Muḥammad], the Book [i.e., the Qur’ān] in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what Allāh has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method.[1] Had Allāh willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good.[2] To Allāh is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.","[1] Prior to this revelation, which supersedes all previous scriptures.\n[2] i.e., obedience to Allāh according to what He enjoined in the Qur’ān and through the sunnah of His Prophet (ﷺ)."
  5,49,"And judge, [O Muḥammad], between them by what Allāh has revealed and do not follow their inclinations and beware of them, lest they tempt you away from some of what Allāh has revealed to you. And if they turn away - then know that Allāh only intends to afflict them with some of their [own] sins. And indeed, many among the people are defiantly disobedient.",""
  5,50,"Then is it the judgement of [the time of] ignorance they desire? But who is better than Allāh in judgement for a people who are certain [in faith].",""
