quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  48,10,"Indeed, those who pledge allegiance to you, [O Muḥammad] - they are actually pledging allegiance to Allāh. The hand[1] of Allāh is over their hands.[2] So he who breaks his word only breaks it to the detriment of himself. And he who fulfills that which he has promised Allāh - He will give him a great reward.","[1] See footnote to 2:19.\n[2] Meaning that He (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) accepted their pledge."
  48,11,"Those who remained behind[1] of the bedouins will say to you, \"Our properties and our families occupied us, so ask forgiveness for us.\" They say with their tongues what is not within their hearts. Say, \"Then who could prevent Allāh at all if He intended for you harm or intended for you benefit? Rather, ever is Allāh, of what you do, Aware.","[1] See footnote to 9:81."
  48,12,"But you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families, ever, and that was made pleasing in your hearts. And you assumed an assumption of evil and became a people ruined.\"",""
  48,13,"And whoever has not believed in Allāh and His Messenger - then indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers a Blaze.",""
  48,14,"And to Allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And ever is Allāh Forgiving and Merciful.",""
  48,15,"Those who remained[1] behind will say when you set out toward the war booty to take it, \"Let us follow you.\" They wish to change the words of Allāh. Say, \"Never will you follow us. Thus did Allāh say before.\" So they will say, \"Rather, you envy us.\" But [in fact] they were not understanding except a little.[2]","[1] See footnote to 9:81.\n[2] i.e., they only understood the material aspects of life."
