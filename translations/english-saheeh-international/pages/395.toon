quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  28,78,"He said, \"I was only given it because of knowledge I have.\" Did he not know that Allāh had destroyed before him of generations those who were greater than him in power and greater in accumulation [of wealth]? But the criminals, about their sins, will not be asked.[1]","[1] There will be no need to enumerate their sins separately, as their quantity is obvious and more than sufficient to warrant punishment in Hell."
  28,79,"So he came out before his people in his adornment. Those who desired the worldly life said, \"Oh, would that we had like what was given to Qārūn. Indeed, he is one of great fortune.\"",""
  28,80,"But those who had been given knowledge said, \"Woe to you! The reward of Allāh is better for he who believes and does righteousness. And none are granted it except the patient.\"",""
  28,81,"And We caused the earth to swallow him and his home. And there was for him no company to aid him other than Allāh, nor was he of those who [could] defend themselves.",""
  28,82,"And those who had wished for his position the previous day began to say, \"Oh, how Allāh extends provision to whom He wills of His servants and restricts it! If not that Allāh had conferred favor on us, He would have caused it to swallow us. Oh, how the disbelievers do not succeed!\"",""
  28,83,"That home of the Hereafter We assign to those who do not desire exaltedness upon the earth or corruption. And the [best] outcome is for the righteous.",""
  28,84,"Whoever comes [on the Day of Judgement] with a good deed will have better than it; and whoever comes with an evil deed - then those who did evil deeds will not be recompensed except [as much as] what they used to do.",""
