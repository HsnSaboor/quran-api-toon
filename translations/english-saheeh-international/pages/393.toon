  28,61,"Then is he whom We have promised a good promise which he will meet [i.e., obtain] like he for whom We provided enjoyment of worldly life [but] then he is, on the Day of Resurrection, among those presented [for punishment in Hell]?",""
  28,62,"And [warn of] the Day He will call them and say, \"Where are My 'partners' which you used to claim?\"",""
  28,63,"Those upon whom the word[1] will have come into effect will say, \"Our Lord, these are the ones we led to error. We led them to error just as we were in error. We declare our disassociation [from them] to You.
