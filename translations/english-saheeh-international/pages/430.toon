quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  34,15,"There was for [the tribe of] Saba’ in their dwelling place a sign: two [fields of] gardens on the right and on the left. [They were told], \"Eat from the provisions of your Lord and be grateful to Him. A good land [have you], and a forgiving Lord.\"",""
  34,16,"But they turned away [refusing], so We sent upon them the flood of the dam,[1] and We replaced their two [fields of] gardens with gardens of bitter fruit, tamarisks and something of sparse lote trees.","[1] i.e., caused by a break in their dam. Another meaning is \"the overwhelming flood.\""
  34,17,"[By] that We repaid them because they disbelieved. And do We [thus] repay except the ungrateful?",""
  34,18,"And We placed between them and the cities which We had blessed[1] [many] visible cities. And We determined between them the [distances of] journey,[2] [saying], \"Travel between them by night or by day in safety.\"","[1] In the lands of what is now southern Syria and Palestine.\n[2] i.e., We placed the intermediate settlements at calculated distances for the convenience of travelers."
  34,19,"But [insolently] they said, \"Our Lord, lengthen the distance between our journeys,\" and wronged themselves, so We made them narrations[1] and dispersed them in total dispersion. Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful.","[1] Stories related to others as lessons or examples."
  34,20,"And Iblees had already confirmed through them[1] his assumption,[2] so they followed him, except for a party of believers.","[1] i.e., the people of Saba’ or mankind in general.\n[2] That mankind could readily be misled by him."
  34,21,"And he had over them no authority except [it was decreed] that We might make evident who believes in the Hereafter from who is thereof in doubt. And your Lord, over all things, is Guardian.[1]","[1] Protecting and preserving the existence and attributes of His creations."
  34,22,"Say, [O Muḥammad], \"Invoke those you claim [as deities] besides Allāh.\" They do not possess an atom's weight [of ability] in the heavens or on the earth, and they do not have therein any partnership [with Him], nor is there for Him from among them any assistant.",""
