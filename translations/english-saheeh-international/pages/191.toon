quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,27,"Then Allāh will accept repentance after that for whom He wills; and Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.",""
  9,28,"O you who have believed, indeed the polytheists are unclean, so let them not approach al-Masjid al-Ḥarām after this, their [final] year. And if you fear privation, Allāh will enrich you from His bounty if He wills. Indeed, Allāh is Knowing and Wise.",""
  9,29,"Fight against those who do not believe in Allāh or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allāh and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth [i.e., Islām] from those who were given the Scripture - [fight] until they give the jizyah[1] willingly while they are humbled.","[1] A tax required of non-Muslims exempting them from military service and entitling them to the protection of the Islāmic state. Concurrently, zakāh is not taken from them, being an obligation only upon Muslims."
  9,30,"The Jews say, \"Ezra is the son of Allāh\"; and the Christians say, \"The Messiah is the son of Allāh.\" That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before [them]. May Allāh destroy them; how are they deluded?",""
  9,31,"They have taken their scholars and monks as lords besides Allāh,[1] and [also] the Messiah, the son of Mary.[2] And they were not commanded except to worship one God; there is no deity except Him. Exalted is He above whatever they associate with Him.","[1] By their obedience to them rather than to what Allāh ordained.\n[2] By their worship of him in conjunction with Allāh."
