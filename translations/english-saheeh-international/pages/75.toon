quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,187,"And [mention, O Muḥammad], when Allāh took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture, [saying], \"You must make it clear [i.e., explain it] to the people and not conceal it.\" But they threw it away behind their backs and exchanged it for a small price. And wretched is that which they purchased."
  3,188,"And never think that those who rejoice in what they have perpetrated and like to be praised for what they did not do - never think them [to be] in safety from the punishment, and for them is a painful punishment."
  3,189,"And to Allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allāh is over all things competent."
  3,190,"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding -"
  3,191,"Who remember Allāh while standing or sitting or [lying] on their sides and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth, [saying], \"Our Lord, You did not create this aimlessly; exalted are You [above such a thing]; then protect us from the punishment of the Fire."
  3,192,"Our Lord, indeed whoever You admit to the Fire - You have disgraced him, and for the wrongdoers there are no helpers."
  3,193,"Our Lord, indeed we have heard a caller [i.e., Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ)] calling to faith, [saying], 'Believe in your Lord,' and we have believed. Our Lord, so forgive us our sins and remove from us our misdeeds and cause us to die among the righteous."
  3,194,"Our Lord, and grant us what You promised us through Your messengers and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, You do not fail in [Your] promise.\""
