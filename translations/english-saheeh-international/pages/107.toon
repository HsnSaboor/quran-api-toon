quran[3]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,3,"Prohibited to you are dead animals,[1] blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allāh, and [those animals] killed by strangling or by a violent blow or by a head-long fall or by the goring of horns, and those from which a wild animal has eaten, except what you [are able to] slaughter [before its death], and those which are sacrificed on stone altars,[2] and [prohibited is] that you seek decision through divining arrows. That is grave disobedience. This day those who disbelieve have despaired of [defeating] your religion; so fear them not, but fear Me. This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islām as religion. But whoever is forced by severe hunger with no inclination to sin - then indeed, Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.","[1] See footnote to 2:173.\n[2] In the name of anything other than Allāh."
  5,4,"They ask you, [O Muḥammad], what has been made lawful for them. Say, \"Lawful for you are [all] good foods and [game caught by] what you have trained of hunting animals[1] which you train as Allāh has taught you. So eat of what they catch for you, and mention the name of Allāh upon it, and fear Allāh.\" Indeed, Allāh is swift in account.","[1] Such as dogs, falcons, etc."
  5,5,"This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. And [lawful in marriage are] chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture before you, when you have given them their due compensation,[1] desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking [secret] lovers. And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.","[1] The specified bridal gift (mahr)."
