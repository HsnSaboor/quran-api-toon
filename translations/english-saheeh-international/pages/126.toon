quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  5,109,"[Be warned of] the Day when Allāh will assemble the messengers and say, \"What was the response you received?\" They will say, \"We have no knowledge. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen\" -",""
  5,110,"[The Day] when Allāh will say, \"O Jesus, Son of Mary, remember My favor upon you and upon your mother when I supported you with the Pure Spirit [i.e., the angel Gabriel] and you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and [remember] when I taught you writing and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and when you designed from clay [what was] like the form of a bird with My permission, then you breathed into it, and it became a bird with My permission; and you healed the blind [from birth] and the leper with My permission; and when you brought forth the dead with My permission; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from [killing] you when you came to them with clear proofs and those who disbelieved among them said, \"This is not but obvious magic.\"",""
  5,111,"And [remember] when I inspired to the disciples, \"Believe in Me and in My messenger [i.e., Jesus].\" They said, \"We have believed, so bear witness that indeed we are Muslims [in submission to Allāh].\"",""
  5,112,"[And remember] when the disciples said, \"O Jesus, Son of Mary, can your Lord[1] send down to us a table [spread with food] from the heaven?\" [Jesus] said, \"Fear Allāh, if you should be believers.\"","[1] i.e., will Allāh consent to. (His ability is undoubted.)"
  5,113,"They said, \"We wish to eat from it and let our hearts be reassured and know that you have been truthful to us and be among its witnesses.\"",""
