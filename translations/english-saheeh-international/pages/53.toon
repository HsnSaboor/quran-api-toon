quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,23,"Do you not consider, [O Muḥammad], those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They are invited to the Scripture of Allāh that it should arbitrate between them;[1] then a party of them turns away, and they are refusing.","[1] Referring to the Jews of Madīnah who refused to implement the rulings given by Allāh in the Torah or to acknowledge the Prophet (ﷺ), whose coming was mentioned therein."
  3,24,"That is because they say, \"Never will the Fire touch us except for [a few] numbered days,\" and [because] they were deluded in their religion by what they were inventing.",""
  3,25,"So how will it be when We assemble them for a Day about which there is no doubt? And each soul will be compensated [in full for] what it earned, and they will not be wronged.",""
  3,26,"Say, \"O Allāh, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty away from whom You will. You honor whom You will and You humble whom You will. In Your hand[1] is [all] good. Indeed, You are over all things competent.","[1] See footnote to 2:19."
  3,27,"You cause the night to enter the day, and You cause the day to enter the night; and You bring the living out of the dead, and You bring the dead out of the living. And You give provision to whom You will without account [i.e., limit or measure].\"",""
  3,28,"Let not believers take disbelievers as allies [i.e., supporters or protectors] rather than believers. And whoever [of you] does that has nothing [i.e., no association] with Allāh, except when taking precaution against them in prudence.[1] And Allāh warns you of Himself, and to Allāh is the [final] destination.","[1] When fearing harm from an enemy, the believer may pretend as long as his heart and intention are not affected."
  3,29,"Say, \"Whether you conceal what is in your breasts or reveal it, Allāh knows it. And He knows that which is in the heavens and that which is on the earth. And Allāh is over all things competent.",""
