quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  40,78,"And We have already sent messengers before you. Among them are those [whose stories] We have related to you, and among them are those [whose stories] We have not related to you. And it was not for any messenger to bring a sign [or verse] except by permission of Allāh. So when the command of Allāh comes, it will be concluded [i.e., judged] in truth, and the falsifiers will thereupon lose [all].",""
  40,79,"It is Allāh who made for you the grazing animals upon which you ride, and some of them you eat.",""
  40,80,"And for you therein are [other] benefits and that you may realize upon them a need which is in your breasts;[1] and upon them and upon ships you are carried.","[1] i.e., that you may use the animals to carry your loads to distant places, according to need."
  40,81,"And He shows you His signs. So which of the signs of Allāh do you deny?",""
  40,82,"Have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them? They were more numerous than themselves and greater in strength and in impression on the land, but they were not availed by what they used to earn.",""
  40,83,"And when their messengers came to them with clear proofs, they [merely] rejoiced in what they had of knowledge, but they were enveloped by what they used to ridicule.",""
  40,84,"And when they saw Our punishment, they said, \"We believe in Allāh alone and disbelieve in that which we used to associate with Him.\"",""
  40,85,"But never did their faith benefit them once they saw Our punishment. [It is] the established way of Allāh which has preceded among His servants. And the disbelievers thereupon lost [all].",""
