  17,97,"And whoever Allāh guides - he is the [rightly] guided; and whoever He sends astray[1] - you will never find for them protectors besides Him, and We will gather them on the Day of Resurrection [fallen] on their faces - blind, dumb and deaf. Their refuge is Hell; every time it subsides, We increase [for] them blazing fire.","[1] As a result of his own preference."
