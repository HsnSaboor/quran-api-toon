quran[12]{c,v,t,f}:
  43,11,"And who sends down rain from the sky in measured amounts, and We revive thereby a dead land - thus will you be brought forth -",""
  43,12,"And who created the species, all of them, and has made for you of ships and animals those which you mount",""
  43,13,"That you may settle yourselves upon their backs and then remember the favor of your Lord when you have settled upon them and say, \"Exalted is He who has subjected this to us, and we could not have [otherwise] subdued it.[1]","[1] Literally, \"made it a companion\" or \"made it compatible.\""
  43,14,"And indeed we, to our Lord, will [surely] return.\"",""
  43,15,"But they have attributed to Him from His servants a portion.[1] Indeed, man is clearly ungrateful.","[1] By claiming that He (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) has a son or daughters, as it is said that a child is part of his parent. This concept is totally incompatible with Allāh's unity and exclusiveness."
  43,16,"Or has He taken, out of what He has created, daughters and chosen you for [having] sons?",""
  43,17,"And when one of them is given good tidings of that which he attributes to the Most Merciful in comparison [i.e., a daughter], his face becomes dark, and he suppresses grief.",""
  43,18,"So is one brought up in ornaments while being during conflict unevident[1] [attributed to Allāh]?","[1] Not \"obvious\" or \"distinct\" in an argument. Or not \"seen,\" i.e., absent from battles. The reference is to a daughter."
  43,19,"And they described the angels, who are servants of the Most Merciful, as females. Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be recorded, and they will be questioned.",""
  43,20,"And they said, \"If the Most Merciful had willed, we would not have worshipped them.\" They have of that no knowledge. They are not but misjudging.",""
  43,21,"Or have We given them a book before it [i.e., the Qur’ān] to which they are adhering?",""
  43,22,"Rather, they say, \"Indeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and we are in their footsteps [rightly] guided.\"",""
