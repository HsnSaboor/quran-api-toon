quran[3]{c,v,t,f}:
  4,12,"And for you is half of what your wives leave if they have no child. But if they have a child, for you is one fourth of what they leave, after any bequest they [may have] made or debt. And for them [i.e., the wives] is one fourth if you leave no child. But if you leave a child, then for them is an eighth of what you leave, after any bequest you [may have] made or debt. And if a man or woman leaves neither ascendants nor descendants but has a brother or a sister, then for each one of them is a sixth. But if they are more than two, they share a third,[1] after any bequest which was made or debt, as long as there is no detriment [caused].[2] [This is] an ordinance from Allāh, and Allāh is Knowing and Forbearing.","[1] These shares are divided equally between males and females. The siblings referred to in this verse are from the mother's side only. Those from \nthe father or both parents are mentioned in Āyah 176.\n[2] This is a condition for any bequest. If it has been violated by the deceased, his bequest is not to be honored, or it may be adjusted by the executor. See 2:182."
  4,13,"These are the limits [set by] Allāh, and whoever obeys Allāh and His Messenger will be admitted by Him to gardens [in Paradise] under which rivers flow, abiding eternally therein; and that is the great attainment.",""
  4,14,"And whoever disobeys Allāh and His Messenger and transgresses His limits - He will put him into the Fire to abide eternally therein, and he will have a humiliating punishment.",""
