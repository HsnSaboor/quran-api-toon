  18,5,"They have no knowledge of it,[1] nor had their fathers. Grave is the word that comes out of their mouths; they speak not except a lie.","[1] i.e., they could not have had knowledge of something which is not true."
  18,6,"Then perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them, [O Muḥammad], if they do not believe in this message, [and] out of sorrow.",""
  18,7,"Indeed, We have made that which is on the earth adornment for it that We may test them [as to] which of them is best in deed.",""
  18,8,"And indeed, We will make that which is upon it [into] a barren ground.",""
  18,9,"Or have you thought that the companions of the cave and the inscription were, among Our signs, a wonder?[1]","[1] Rather, it is only one of the many wonders of Allāh."
  18,10,"[Mention] when the youths retreated to the cave and said, \"Our Lord, grant us from Yourself mercy and prepare for us from our affair right guidance.\"",""

  18,14,"And We bound [i.e., made firm] their hearts when they stood up and said, \"Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. Never will we invoke besides Him any deity. We would have certainly spoken, then, an excessive transgression.",""
  18,15,"These, our people, have taken besides Him deities. Why do they not bring for [worship of] them a clear evidence? And who is more unjust than one who invents about Allāh a lie?\"",""
