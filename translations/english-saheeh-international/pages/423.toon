  33,36,"It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allāh and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allāh and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error.",""
  33,37,"And [remember, O Muḥammad], when you said to the one on whom Allāh bestowed favor and you bestowed favor,[1] \"Keep your wife and fear Allāh,\" while you concealed within yourself that which Allāh is to disclose.[2] And you feared the people,[3] while Allāh has more right that you fear Him.[4] So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort [i.e., guilt] concerning the wives of their claimed [i.e., adopted] sons when they no longer have need of them. And ever is the command [i.e., decree] of Allāh accomplished.","[1] Referring to the Prophet's freed slave, Zayd bin Ḥārithah.\n[2] i.e., Allāh's command to the Prophet (ﷺ) to marry Zaynab after Zayd divorced her. This was to demonstrate that a man may marry a woman formerly married to his adopted son.\n[3] i.e., feared their saying that the Prophet (ﷺ) had married the (former) wife of his son (which is prohibited by Allāh in the case of a true, begotten son).\n[4] By making known His command."

An additional meaning is that He praises you in the presence of the angels."
