quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,113,"The Jews say, \"The Christians have nothing [true] to stand on,\" and the Christians say, \"The Jews have nothing to stand on,\" although they [both] recite the Scripture. Thus do those who know not [i.e., the polytheists] speak the same as their words. But Allāh will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.",""
  2,114,"And who are more unjust than those who prevent the name of Allāh from being mentioned [i.e., praised] in His mosques and strive toward their destruction. It is not for them to enter them except in fear. For them in this world is disgrace, and they will have in the Hereafter a great punishment.",""
  2,115,"And to Allāh belongs the east and the west. So wherever you [might] turn, there is the Face[1] of Allāh. Indeed, Allāh is all-Encompassing and Knowing.","[1] See footnote to 2:19."
  2,116,"They say, \"Allāh has taken a son.\" Exalted is He![1] Rather, to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. All are devoutly obedient to Him,","[1] Subḥānahu means \"far exalted is He above all they falsely attribute to Him.\""
  2,117,"Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, \"Be,\" and it is.",""
  2,118,"Those who do not know say, \"Why does Allāh not speak to us or there come to us a sign?\" Thus spoke those before them like their words. Their hearts resemble each other. We have shown clearly the signs to a people who are certain [in faith].",""
  2,119,"Indeed, We have sent you, [O Muḥammad], with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner, and you will not be asked about the companions of Hellfire.",""
