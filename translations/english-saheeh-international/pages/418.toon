quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  33,1,"O Prophet, fear Allāh and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Indeed, Allāh is ever Knowing and Wise.",""
  33,2,"And follow that which is revealed to you from your Lord. Indeed Allāh is ever, of what you do, Aware.",""
  33,3,"And rely upon Allāh; and sufficient is Allāh as Disposer of affairs.[1]","[1] Refer to footnote in 3:173."
  33,4,"Allāh has not made for a man two hearts in his interior. And He has not made your wives whom you declare unlawful[1] your mothers. And He has not made your claimed [i.e., adopted] sons your [true] sons. That is [merely] your saying by your mouths, but Allāh says the truth, and He guides to the [right] way.","[1] By the expression \"You are to me like the back of my mother.\" Such an oath taken against approaching one's wife was a pre-Islāmic practice declared by Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) to be a sin requiring expiation as described in 58:3-4."
  33,5,"Call them[1] by [the names of] their fathers; it is more just in the sight of Allāh. But if you do not know their fathers - then they are [still] your brothers in religion and those entrusted to you. And there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred but [only for] what your hearts intended. And ever is Allāh Forgiving and Merciful.","[1] Those children under your care."
  33,6,"The Prophet is more worthy of the believers than themselves,[1] and his wives are [in the position of] their mothers. And those of [blood] relationship are more entitled [to inheritance] in the decree of Allāh than the [other] believers and the emigrants, except that you may do to your close associates a kindness [through bequest]. That was in the Book[2] inscribed.","[1] He (ﷺ) is more worthy of their obedience and loyalty and is more concerned for them than they are for one another.\n[2] The Preserved Slate (al-Lawḥ al-Maḥfūẓ)."
