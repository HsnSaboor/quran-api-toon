quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  22,73,"O people, an example is presented, so listen to it. Indeed, those you invoke besides Allāh will never create [as much as] a fly, even if they gathered together for it [i.e., that purpose]. And if the fly should steal from them a [tiny] thing, they could not recover it from him. Weak are the pursuer and pursued.[1]","[1] A comparison is made here to the worshipper of a false deity and that which he worships."
  22,74,"They have not appraised Allāh with true appraisal.[1] Indeed, Allāh is Powerful and Exalted in Might.","[1] They have not assessed Him with the assessment due to Him, meaning that they did not take into account His perfect attributes."
  22,75,"Allāh chooses from the angels messengers and from the people. Indeed, Allāh is Hearing and Seeing.",""
  22,76,"He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them.[1] And to Allāh will be returned [all] matters.","[1] See footnote to 20:110."
  22,77,"O you who have believed, bow and prostrate and worship your Lord and do good - that you may succeed.",""
  22,78,"And strive for Allāh with the striving due to Him. He has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty. [It is] the religion of your father, Abraham. He [i.e., Allāh] named you \"Muslims\" before [in former scriptures] and in this [revelation] that the Messenger may be a witness over you and you may be witnesses over the people. So establish prayer and give zakāh and hold fast to Allāh. He is your protector; and excellent is the protector, and excellent is the helper.",""
