quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  6,60,"And it is He who takes your souls by night[1] and knows what you have committed by day. Then He revives you therein [i.e., by day] that a specified term[2] may be fulfilled. Then to Him will be your return; then He will inform you about what you used to do.","[1] i.e., when you sleep.\n[2] One's decreed life span."
  6,61,"And He is the subjugator over His servants, and He sends over you guardian-angels until, when death comes to one of you, Our messengers [i.e., angels of death] take him, and they do not fail [in their duties].",""
  6,62,"Then they [i.e., His servants] are returned to Allāh, their true Lord. Unquestionably, His is the judgement, and He is the swiftest of accountants.",""
