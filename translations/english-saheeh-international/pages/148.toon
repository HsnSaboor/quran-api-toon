quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,147,"So if they deny you, [O Muḥammad], say, \"Your Lord is the possessor of vast mercy; but His punishment cannot be repelled from the people who are criminals.\""
  6,148,"Those who associated [others] with Allāh will say, \"If Allāh had willed, we would not have associated [anything] and neither would our fathers, nor would we have prohibited anything.\" Likewise did those before deny until they tasted Our punishment. Say, \"Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? You follow not except assumption, and you are not but misjudging.\""
  6,149,"Say, \"With Allāh is the far-reaching [i.e., conclusive] argument. If He had willed, He would have guided you all.\""
  6,150,"Say, [O Muḥammad], \"Bring forward your witnesses who will testify that Allāh has prohibited this.\" And if they testify, do not testify with them. And do not follow the desires of those who deny Our verses and those who do not believe in the Hereafter, while they equate [others] with their Lord."
  6,151,"Say, \"Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you. [He commands] that you not associate anything with Him, and to parents, good treatment, and do not kill your children out of poverty; We will provide for you and them. And do not approach immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed. And do not kill the soul which Allāh has forbidden [to be killed] except by [legal] right. This has He instructed you that you may use reason.\""
