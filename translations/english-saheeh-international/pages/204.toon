quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,107,"And [there are] those [hypocrites] who took for themselves a mosque for causing harm and disbelief and division among the believers and as a station for whoever had warred against Allāh and His Messenger before. And they will surely swear, \"We intended only the best.\" And Allāh testifies that indeed they are liars.",""
  9,108,"Do not stand [for prayer] within it - ever. A mosque founded on righteousness from the first day[1] is more worthy for you to stand in. Within it are men who love to purify themselves; and Allāh loves those who purify themselves.","[1] This description is of the Qubā’ mosque."
  9,109,"Then is one who laid the foundation of his building on righteousness [with fear] from Allāh and [seeking] His approval better or one who laid the foundation of his building on the edge of a bank about to collapse, so it collapsed with him into the fire of Hell? And Allāh does not guide the wrongdoing people.",""
  9,110,"Their building which they built will not cease to be a [cause of] skepticism in their hearts until their hearts are cut [i.e., stopped]. And Allāh is Knowing and Wise.",""
  9,111,"Indeed, Allāh has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties [in exchange] for that they will have Paradise. They fight in the cause of Allāh, so they kill and are killed. [It is] a true promise [binding] upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur’ān. And who is truer to his covenant than Allāh? So rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted. And it is that which is the great attainment.",""
