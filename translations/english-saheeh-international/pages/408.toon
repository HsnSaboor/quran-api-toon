quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  30,33,"And when adversity touches the people, they call upon their Lord, turning in repentance to Him. Then when He lets them taste mercy from Him, at once a party of them associate others with their Lord,",""
  30,34,"So that they will deny what We have granted them.[1] Then enjoy yourselves, for you are going to know.","[1] Or \"So let them deny what We have granted them.\""
  30,35,"Or have We sent down to them an authority [i.e., a proof or scripture], and it speaks of what they have been associating with Him?",""
  30,36,"And when We let the people taste mercy, they rejoice therein, but if evil afflicts them for what their hands have put forth, immediately they despair.",""
  30,37,"Do they not see that Allāh extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]? Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.",""
  30,38,"So give the relative his right, as well as the needy and the traveler. That is best for those who desire the face [i.e., approval] of Allāh, and it is they who will be the successful.",""
  30,39,"And whatever you give for interest [i.e., advantage] to increase within the wealth of people[1] will not increase with Allāh. But what you give in zakāh,[2] desiring the face [i.e., approval] of Allāh - those are the multipliers.[3]","[1] The phrase includes several connotations, among them: a) that which is given as usury or interest, b) that which is given on the condition that it be repaid with interest, and c) a gift given with the intention of obtaining from the recipient greater benefit or a larger gift.\n[2] The meaning of ṣadaqah (voluntary charity) is included here.\n[3] Of their blessings on earth and their rewards in the Hereafter."
  30,40,"Allāh is the one who created you, then provided for you, then will cause you to die, and then will give you life. Are there any of your \"partners\" who does anything of that? Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.",""
  30,41,"Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by [reason of] what the hands of people have earned so He [i.e., Allāh] may let them taste part of [the consequence of] what they have done that perhaps they will return [to righteousness].",""
