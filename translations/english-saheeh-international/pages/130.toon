  6,19,"Say, \"What thing is greatest in testimony?\" Say, \"Allāh is witness between me and you. And this Qur’ān was revealed to me that I may warn you thereby and whomever it reaches.[1] Do you [truly] testify that with Allāh there are other deities?\" Say, \"I will not testify [with you].\" Say, \"Indeed, He is but one God, and indeed, I am free of what you associate [with Him].\"","[1] At every time and place until the Day of Judgement."
  6,20,"Those to whom We have given the Scripture recognize it[1] as they recognize their [own] sons. Those who will lose themselves [in the Hereafter] do not believe.","[1] The Qur’ān. Also interpreted as \"him,\" meaning Muḥammad (ﷺ)."

  6,26,"And they prevent [others] from him and are [themselves] remote from him. And they do not destroy except themselves, but they perceive [it] not.",""
