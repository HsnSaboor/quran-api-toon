  27,36,"So when they came to Solomon, he said, \"Do you provide me with wealth? But what Allāh has given me is better than what He has given you. Rather, it is you who rejoice in your gift.",""
  27,37,"Return to them, for we will surely come to them with soldiers that they will be powerless to encounter, and we will surely expel them therefrom in humiliation, and they will be debased.\"",""
  27,38,"[Solomon] said, \"O assembly [of jinn], which of you will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?\"",""
  27,39,"A powerful one from among the jinn said, \"I will bring it to you before you rise from your place, and indeed, I am for this [task] strong and trustworthy.\"",""
  27,40,"Said one who had knowledge from the Scripture, \"I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you.\" And when [Solomon] saw it placed before him, he said, \"This is from the favor of my Lord to test me whether I will be grateful or ungrateful. And whoever is grateful - his gratitude is only for [the benefit of] himself. And whoever is ungrateful - then indeed, my Lord is Free of need and Generous.\"",""
  27,41,"He said, \"Disguise for her her throne; we will see whether she will be guided [to truth] or will be of those who is not guided.\"",""
  27,42,"So when she arrived, it was said [to her], \"Is your throne like this?\" She said, \"[It is] as though it was it.\" [Solomon said], \"And we were given knowledge before her, and we have been Muslims [in submission to Allāh].",""
  27,43,"And that which she was worshipping other than Allāh had averted her [from submission to Him]. Indeed, she was from a disbelieving people.\"",""
  27,44,"She was told, \"Enter the palace.\" But when she saw it, she thought it was a body of water[1] and uncovered her shins [to wade through]. He said, \"Indeed, it is a palace [whose floor is] made smooth with glass.\" She said, \"My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, and I submit with Solomon to Allāh, Lord of the worlds.\"","[1] The floor was transparent, and beneath it was flowing water."
