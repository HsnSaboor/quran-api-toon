quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  11,82,"So when Our command came, We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of layered hard clay, [which were]",""
  11,83,"Marked from your Lord. And it [i.e., Allāh's punishment] is not from the wrongdoers [very] far.",""
  11,84,"And to Madyan [We sent] their brother Shuʿayb. He said, \"O my people, worship Allāh; you have no deity other than Him. And do not decrease from the measure and the scale. Indeed, I see you in prosperity, but indeed, I fear for you the punishment of an all-encompassing Day.",""
  11,85,"And O my people, give full measure and weight in justice and do not deprive the people of their due and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption.",""
  11,86,"What remains [lawful] from Allāh is best for you, if you would be believers. But I am not a guardian over you.\"",""
  11,87,"They said, \"O Shuʿayb, does your prayer [i.e., religion] command you that we should leave what our fathers worship or not do with our wealth what we please? Indeed, you are the forbearing, the discerning!\"[1]","[1] This is a sarcastic description implying the opposite."
  11,88,"He said, \"O my people, have you considered: if I am upon clear evidence from my Lord and He has provided me with a good provision from Him...?[1] And I do not intend to differ from you in that which I have forbidden you; I only intend reform as much as I am able. And my success is not but through Allāh. Upon Him I have relied, and to Him I return.[2]","[1] The conclusion of the sentence is estimated as \"...would it not be my duty to warn you against corruption and disobedience?\"\n[2] i.e., I turn to Allāh frequently in supplication and repentance."
