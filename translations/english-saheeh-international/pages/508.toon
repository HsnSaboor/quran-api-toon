quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  47,12,"Indeed, Allāh will admit those who have believed and done righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow, but those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as grazing livestock eat, and the Fire will be a residence for them.",""
  47,13,"And how many a city was stronger than your city [i.e., Makkah] which drove you out? We destroyed them; and there was no helper for them.",""
  47,14,"So is he who is on clear evidence from his Lord like him to whom the evil of his work has been made attractive and they follow their [own] desires?",""
  47,15,"Is the description of Paradise, which the righteous are promised, wherein are rivers of water unaltered,[1] rivers of milk the taste of which never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of purified honey, in which they will have from all [kinds of] fruits and forgiveness from their Lord... [Are its inhabitants] like those who abide eternally in the Fire and are given to drink scalding water that will sever their intestines?","[1] In taste or smell, neither stagnant nor polluted."
  47,16,"And among them, [O Muḥammad], are those who listen to you, until when they depart from you, they say to those who were given knowledge,[1] \"What has he said just now?\" Those are the ones of whom Allāh has sealed over their hearts and who have followed their [own] desires.","[1] From among the Prophet's companions."
  47,17,"And those who are guided - He increases them in guidance and gives them their righteousness.[1]","[1] Taqwā, meaning piety, consciousness and fear of Allāh, and care to avoid His displeasure."
  47,18,"Then do they await except that the Hour should come upon them unexpectedly? But already there have come [some of] its indications. Then how [i.e., what good] to them, when it has come, will be their remembrance?",""
