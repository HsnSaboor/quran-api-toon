quran[6]{c,v,t,f}:
  57,19,"And those who have believed in Allāh and His messengers - those are [in the ranks of] the supporters of truth and the martyrs, with their Lord. For them is their reward and their light.[1] But those who have disbelieved and denied Our verses - those are the companions of Hellfire.","[1] Another accepted meaning is \"And those who have believed in Allāh and His messengers - they are the supporters of truth. And the martyrs, with their Lord, will have their reward and their light.\""
  57,20,"Know that the life of this world is but amusement and diversion and adornment and boasting to one another and competition in increase of wealth and children - like the example of a rain whose [resulting] plant growth pleases the tillers; then it dries and you see it turned yellow; then it becomes [scattered] debris. And in the Hereafter is severe punishment and forgiveness from Allāh and approval. And what is the worldly life except the enjoyment of delusion.",""
  57,21,"Race [i.e., compete] toward forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden whose width is like the width of the heavens and earth, prepared for those who believed in Allāh and His messengers. That is the bounty of Allāh which He gives to whom He wills, and Allāh is the possessor of great bounty.",""
  57,22,"No disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a register[1] before We bring it into being - indeed that, for Allāh, is easy -","[1] i.e., the Preserved Slate (al-Lawḥ al-Maḥfūẓ)."
  57,23,"In order that you not despair over what has eluded you and not exult [in pride] over what He has given you. And Allāh does not like everyone self-deluded and boastful -",""
  57,24,"[Those] who are stingy and enjoin upon people stinginess. And whoever turns away[1] - then indeed, Allāh is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.","[1] Refusing to spend for Allāh's cause or refusing obedience to Him."
