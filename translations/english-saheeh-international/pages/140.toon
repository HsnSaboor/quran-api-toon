  6,95,"Indeed, Allāh is the cleaver of grain and date seeds.[1] He brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living. That is Allāh; so how are you deluded?","[1] He (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) causes them to split and sprout."
  6,96,"[He is] the cleaver of daybreak and has made the night for rest and the sun and moon for calculation.[1] That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.","[1] Or \"according to calculation,\" referring to their precise movement."

  6,99,"And it is He who sends down rain from the sky, and We produce thereby the growth of all things. We produce from it greenery from which We produce grains arranged in layers. And from the palm trees - of its emerging fruit are clusters hanging low. And [We produce] gardens of grapevines and olives and pomegranates, similar yet varied. Look at [each of] its fruit when it yields and [at] its ripening. Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.",""
