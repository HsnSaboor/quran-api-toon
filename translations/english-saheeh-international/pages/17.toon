quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,106,"We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allāh is over all things competent?",""
  2,107,"Do you not know that to Allāh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and [that] you have not besides Allāh any protector or any helper?",""
  2,108,"Or do you intend to ask[1] your Messenger as Moses was asked before? And whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.","[1] i.e., persistently question or, as in the case of the disbelievers, demand a miracle of the Prophet (ﷺ) ."
  2,109,"Many of the People of the Scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from themselves [even] after the truth has become clear to them. So pardon and overlook until Allāh delivers His command. Indeed, Allāh is over all things competent.",""
  2,110,"And establish prayer and give zakāh, and whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with Allāh. Indeed Allāh, of what you do, is Seeing.",""
  2,111,"And they say, \"None will enter Paradise except one who is a Jew or a Christian.\" That is [merely] their wishful thinking. Say, \"Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.\"",""
  2,112,"Yes, [on the contrary], whoever submits his face [i.e., self] in Islām to Allāh while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.",""
