quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  3,101,"And how could you disbelieve while to you are being recited the verses of Allāh and among you is His Messenger? And whoever holds firmly to Allāh[1] has [indeed] been guided to a straight path.","[1] i.e., adhering to His ordinances strictly, then trusting in Him and relying upon Him completely."
  3,102,"O you who have believed, fear Allāh as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims [in submission to Him].",""
  3,103,"And hold firmly to the rope[1] of Allāh all together and do not become divided. And remember the favor of Allāh upon you - when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together and you became, by His favor, brothers. And you were on the edge of a pit of the Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does Allāh make clear to you His verses that you may be guided.","[1] Referring either to His covenant or the Qur’ān."
  3,104,"And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong,[1] and those will be the successful.","[1] According to the laws of Allāh."
  3,105,"And do not be like the ones who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them. And those will have a great punishment",""
  3,106,"On the Day [some] faces will turn white and [some] faces will turn black. As for those whose faces turn black, [to them it will be said], \"Did you disbelieve [i.e., reject faith] after your belief? Then taste the punishment for what you used to reject.\"",""
  3,107,"But as for those whose faces turn white, [they will be] within the mercy of Allāh. They will abide therein eternally.",""
  3,108,"These are the verses of Allāh. We recite them to you, [O Muḥammad], in truth; and Allāh wants no injustice to the worlds [i.e., His creatures].",""
