And if they breastfeed for you, then give them their payment and confer among yourselves in the acceptable way; but if you are in discord, then there may breastfeed for him [i.e., the father] another woman.[3]","[1] During their waiting period (referring to wives whose divorce has been pronounced).\n[2] So that they would be forced to leave or to ransom themselves.\n[3] See 2:233."
  65,7,"Let a man of wealth spend from his wealth, and he whose provision is restricted - let him spend from what Allāh has given him. Allāh does not charge a soul except [according to] what He has given it. Allāh will bring about, after hardship, ease [i.e., relief].",""
