quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  57,12,"On the Day you see the believing men and believing women, their light proceeding before them and on their right, [it will be said], \"Your good tidings today are [of] gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein you will abide eternally.\" That is what is the great attainment.",""
  57,13,"On the [same] Day the hypocrite men and hypocrite women will say to those who believed, \"Wait for us that we may acquire some of your light.\" It will be said, \"Go back behind you[1] and seek light.\" And a wall will be placed between them with a door, its interior containing mercy, but on the outside of it is torment.","[1] To where light was acquired, i.e., in the worldly life."
  57,14,"They [i.e., the hypocrites] will call to them [i.e., the believers], \"Were we not with you?\" They will say, \"Yes, but you afflicted yourselves[1] and awaited [misfortune for us] and doubted, and wishful thinking deluded you until there came the command of Allāh. And the Deceiver [i.e., Satan] deceived you concerning Allāh.","[1] By hypocrisy or by falling into temptations."
  57,15,"So today no ransom will be taken from you or from those who disbelieved. Your refuge is the Fire. It is most worthy of you, and wretched is the destination.\"",""
  57,16,"Has the time not come for those who have believed that their hearts should become humbly submissive at the remembrance of Allāh and what has come down of the truth? And let them not be like those who were given the Scripture before, and a long period passed over them, so their hearts hardened; and many of them are defiantly disobedient.",""
  57,17,"Know that Allāh gives life to the earth after its lifelessness. We have made clear to you the signs; perhaps you will understand.[1]","[1] That similarly, Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) can soften a heart after its hardness and guide one who had previously been astray."
  57,18,"Indeed, the men who practice charity and the women who practice charity and [they who] have loaned Allāh a goodly loan - it will be multiplied for them, and they will have a noble reward.",""
