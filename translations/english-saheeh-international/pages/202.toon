  9,94,"They will make excuses to you when you have returned to them. Say, \"Make no excuse - never will we believe you. Allāh has already informed us of your news [i.e., affair]. And Allāh will observe your deeds, and [so will] His Messenger; then you will be taken back to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed,[1] and He will inform you of what you used to do.\"","[1] See footnotes to 6:73."
  9,95,"They will swear by Allāh to you when you return to them that you would leave them alone. So leave them alone; indeed they are evil; and their refuge is Hell as recompense for what they had been earning.",""
  9,96,"They swear to you so that you might be satisfied with them. But if you should be satisfied with them - indeed, Allāh is not satisfied with a defiantly disobedient people.",""
  9,97,"The bedouins are stronger in disbelief and hypocrisy and more likely not to know the limits of what [laws] Allāh has revealed to His Messenger. And Allāh is Knowing and Wise.",""
  9,98,"And among the bedouins are some who consider what they spend as a loss[1] and await for you turns of misfortune. Upon them will be a misfortune of evil. And Allāh is Hearing and Knowing.","[1] i.e., a fine or penalty."
  9,99,"But among the bedouins are some who believe in Allāh and the Last Day and consider what they spend as means of nearness to Allāh and of [obtaining] invocations of the Messenger. Unquestionably, it is a means of nearness for them. Allāh will admit them to His mercy. Indeed, Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.",""
