quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  10,71,"And recite to them the news of Noah, when he said to his people, \"O my people, if my residence and my reminding of the signs of Allāh has become burdensome upon you - then I have relied upon Allāh. So resolve upon your plan and [call upon] your associates. Then let not your plan be obscure to you.[1] Then carry it out upon me and do not give me respite.","[1] i.e., Do not let it be a source of doubt or anxiety to you but let it be clear, open and defined."
  10,72,"And if you turn away [from my advice] - then no payment have I asked of you. My reward is only from Allāh, and I have been commanded to be of the Muslims [i.e., those who submit to Allāh].\"",""
  10,73,"And they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ship and made them successors, and We drowned those who denied Our signs. Then see how was the end of those who were warned.",""
  10,74,"Then We sent after him messengers to their peoples, and they came to them with clear proofs. But they were not to believe in that which they had denied before.[1] Thus We seal over the hearts of the transgressors.","[1] i.e., the succeeding generations were persistent in disbelief."
  10,75,"Then We sent after them Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his establishment with Our signs, but they behaved arrogantly and were a criminal people.",""
  10,76,"So when there came to them the truth from Us, they said, \"Indeed, this is obvious magic.\"",""
  10,77,"Moses said, \"Do you say [thus] about the truth when it has come to you? Is this magic? But magicians will not succeed.\"",""
  10,78,"They said, \"Have you come to us to turn us away from that upon which we found our fathers and so that you two may have grandeur in the land? And we are not believers in you.\"",""
