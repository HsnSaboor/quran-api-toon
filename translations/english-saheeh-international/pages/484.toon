quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  42,11,"[He is] Creator of the heavens and the earth. He has made for you from yourselves, mates, and among the cattle, mates; He multiplies you thereby. There is nothing like unto Him,[1] and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.[2]","[1] There is no similarity whatsoever between the Creator and His creation in essence, in attributes or in deed.\n[2] See footnotes to 17:1."
  42,12,"To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. He extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]. Indeed He is, of all things, Knowing.",""
  42,13,"He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon Noah and that which We have revealed to you, [O Muḥammad], and what We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus - to establish the religion and not be divided therein. Difficult for those who associate others with Allāh is that to which you invite them. Allāh chooses for Himself whom He wills and guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him].",""
  42,14,"And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them - out of jealous animosity between themselves. And if not for a word[1] that preceded from your Lord [postponing the penalty] until a specified time, it would have been concluded between them. And indeed, those who were granted inheritance of the Scripture after them are, concerning it, in disquieting doubt.","[1] Decree. See footnote to 10:19."
  42,15,"So to that [religion of Allāh] invite, [O Muḥammad],[1] and remain on a right course as you are commanded and do not follow their inclinations but say, \"I have believed in what Allāh has revealed of scripture [i.e., the Qur’ān], and I have been commanded to do justice among you. Allāh is our Lord and your Lord. For us are our deeds, and for you your deeds.[2] There is no [need for] argument between us and you.[3] Allāh will bring us together, and to Him is the [final] destination.\"","[1] Another meaning understood from the Arabic is \"So because of that [division and separation into sects], invite [them back to Allāh]...\"\n[2] i.e., the consequences thereof.\n[3] Since the truth has been made clear and since those who refuse it do so only out of stubbornness or worldly interests."
