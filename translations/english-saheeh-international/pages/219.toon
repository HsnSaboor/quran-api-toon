  10,89,"[Allāh] said, \"Your supplication has been answered.\"[1] So remain on a right course and follow not the way of those who do not know.\"","[1] Literally, \"the supplication of both of you,\" i.e., that of Moses and of Aaron, who joined by saying, \"Āmeen\" (\"O Allāh, respond\")."
  10,90,"And We took the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them in tyranny and enmity until, when drowning overtook him, he said, \"I believe that there is no deity except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of the Muslims.\"",""

  10,93,"And We had certainly settled the Children of Israel in an agreeable settlement and provided them with good things. And they did not differ until [after] knowledge had come to them.

  10,96,"Indeed, those upon whom the word [i.e., decree] of your Lord has come into effect will not believe,",""
