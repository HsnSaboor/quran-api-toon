  8,1,"They ask you, [O Muḥammad], about the bounties [of war]. Say, \"The [decision concerning] bounties is for Allāh and the Messenger.\" So fear Allāh and amend that which is between you and obey Allāh and His Messenger, if you should be believers.",""
  8,2,"The believers are only those who, when Allāh is mentioned, their hearts become fearful, and when His verses are recited to them, it increases them in faith; and upon their Lord they rely -",""
  8,3,"The ones who establish prayer, and from what We have provided them, they spend.",""
  8,4,"Those are the believers, truly. For them are degrees [of high position] with their Lord and forgiveness and noble provision.",""

  8,6,"Arguing with you concerning the truth after it had become clear, as if they were being driven toward death while they were looking on.",""
  8,7,"[Remember, O believers], when Allāh promised you one of the two groups[1] - that it would be yours - and you wished that the unarmed one would be yours. But Allāh intended to establish the truth by His words and to eliminate the disbelievers","[1] i.e., either the caravan of Quraysh or their army."
  8,8,"That He should establish the truth and abolish falsehood, even if the criminals disliked it.",""
