quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  28,29,"And when Moses had completed the term and was traveling with his family, he perceived from the direction of the mount a fire. He said to his family, \"Stay here; indeed, I have perceived a fire. Perhaps I will bring you from there [some] information or burning wood from the fire that you may warm yourselves.\"",""
  28,30,"But when he came to it, he was called from the right side of the valley in a blessed spot - from the tree,[1] \"O Moses, indeed I am Allāh, Lord of the worlds.\"","[1] Which was within the fire."
  28,31,"And [he was told], \"Throw down your staff.\" But when he saw it writhing as if it was a snake, he turned in flight and did not return.[1] [Allāh said], \"O Moses, approach and fear not. Indeed, you are of the secure.","[1] Or \"did not look back.\""
  28,32,"Insert your hand into the opening of your garment; it will come out white, without disease. And draw in your arm close to you [as prevention] from fear, for those are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his establishment. Indeed, they have been a people defiantly disobedient.\"",""
  28,33,"He said, \"My Lord, indeed I killed from among them someone, and I fear they will kill me.",""
  28,34,"And my brother Aaron is more fluent than me in tongue, so send him with me as support, verifying me. Indeed, I fear that they will deny me.\"",""
  28,35,"[Allāh] said, \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother and grant you both supremacy so they will not reach you. [It will be] through Our signs; you and those who follow you will be the predominant.\"",""
