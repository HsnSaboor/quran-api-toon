quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  22,1,"O mankind, fear your Lord. Indeed, the convulsion of the [final] Hour is a terrible thing.",""
  22,2,"On the Day you see it every nursing mother will be distracted from that [child] she was nursing, and every pregnant woman will abort her pregnancy, and you will see the people [appearing] intoxicated while they are not intoxicated; but the punishment of Allāh is severe.",""
  22,3,"And of the people is he who disputes about Allāh without knowledge and follows every rebellious devil.",""
  22,4,"It has been decreed for him [i.e., every devil] that whoever turns to him - he will misguide him and will lead him to the punishment of the Blaze.",""
  22,5,"O people, if you should be in doubt about the Resurrection, then [consider that] indeed, We created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clinging clot, and then from a lump of flesh, formed and unformed[1] - that We may show you.[2] And We settle in the wombs whom We will for a specified term, then We bring you out as a child, and then [We develop you] that you may reach your [time of] maturity. And among you is he who is taken in [early] death, and among you is he who is returned to the most decrepit [old] age so that he knows, after [once having] knowledge, nothing. And you see the earth barren, but when We send down upon it rain, it quivers and swells and grows [something] of every beautiful kind.","[1] That which is incomplete. This may include what is aborted at that stage.\n[2] Our power and creative ability."
