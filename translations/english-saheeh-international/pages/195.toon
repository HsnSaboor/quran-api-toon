quran[7]{c,v,t,f}:
  9,48,"They had already desired dissension before and had upset matters for you[1] until the truth came and the ordinance [i.e., victory] of Allāh appeared, while they were averse.","[1] Or \"turned matters related to you over [in their minds, considering how to cause you failure].\""
  9,49,"And among them is he who says, \"Permit me [to remain at home] and do not put me to trial.\" Unquestionably, into trial they have fallen.[1] And indeed, Hell will encompass the disbelievers.","[1] By avoiding their obligation, they fell into destruction."
  9,50,"If good befalls you, it distresses them; but if disaster strikes you, they say, \"We took our matter [in hand] before,\"[1] and turn away while they are rejoicing.","[1] The hypocrites claim to have protected themselves by remaining behind."
  9,51,"Say, \"Never will we be struck except by what Allāh has decreed for us; He is our protector.\" And upon Allāh let the believers rely.",""
  9,52,"Say, \"Do you await for us except one of the two best things [i.e., martyrdom or victory] while we await for you that Allāh will afflict you with punishment from Himself or at our hands? So wait; indeed we, along with you, are waiting.\"",""
  9,53,"Say, \"Spend willingly or unwillingly; never will it be accepted from you. Indeed, you have been a defiantly disobedient people.\"",""
  9,54,"And what prevents their expenditures from being accepted from them but that they have disbelieved in Allāh and in His Messenger and that they come not to prayer except while they are lazy and that they do not spend except while they are unwilling.",""
