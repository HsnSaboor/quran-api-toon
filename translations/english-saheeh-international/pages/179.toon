quran[9]{c,v,t,f}:
  8,17,"And you did not kill them, but it was Allāh who killed them.[1] And you threw not, [O Muḥammad], when you threw, but it was Allāh who threw[2] that He might test the believers with a good test.[3] Indeed, Allāh is Hearing and Knowing.","[1] i.e., Your strength was insufficient to overcome them, but Allāh supported you and gave you victory.\n[2] When the Prophet (ﷺ) threw a handful of dust into the faces of the disbelievers, Allāh caused it to fill the eyes and nose of every soldier, preventing their advance.\n[3] So that they would appreciate Allāh's favor to them."
  8,18,"That [is so], and [also] that Allāh will weaken the plot of the disbelievers.",""
  8,19,"If you [disbelievers] seek the decision [i.e., victory] - the decision [i.e., defeat] has come to you. And if you desist [from hostilities], it is best for you; but if you return [to war], We will return, and never will you be availed by your [large] company at all, even if it should increase; and [that is] because Allāh is with the believers.",""
  8,20,"O you who have believed, obey Allāh and His Messenger and do not turn from him while you hear [his order].",""
  8,21,"And do not be like those who say, \"We have heard,\" while they do not hear.",""
  8,22,"Indeed, the worst of living creatures in the sight of Allāh are the deaf and dumb who do not use reason [i.e., the disbelievers].",""
  8,23,"Had Allāh known any good in them, He would have made them hear. And if He had made them hear, they would [still] have turned away, while they were refusing.",""
  8,24,"O you who have believed, respond to Allāh and to the Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life. And know that Allāh intervenes between a man and his heart and that to Him you will be gathered.",""
  8,25,"And fear a trial[1] which will not strike those who have wronged among you exclusively, and know that Allāh is severe in penalty.","[1] i.e., an affliction or punishment during life upon this earth. When corruption spreads among a people, its consequences will affect everyone."
