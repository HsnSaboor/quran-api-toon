quran[3]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,246,"Have you not considered the assembly of the Children of Israel after [the time of] Moses when they said to a prophet of theirs, \"Send to us a king, and we will fight in the way of Allāh\"? He said, \"Would you perhaps refrain from fighting if battle was prescribed for you?\" They said, \"And why should we not fight in the cause of Allāh when we have been driven out from our homes and from our children?\" But when battle was prescribed for them, they turned away, except for a few of them. And Allāh is Knowing of the wrongdoers.",""
  2,247,"And their prophet said to them, \"Indeed, Allāh has sent to you Saul as a king.\" They said, \"How can he have kingship over us while we are more worthy of kingship than him and he has not been given any measure of wealth?\" He said, \"Indeed, Allāh has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allāh gives His sovereignty to whom He wills. And Allāh is all-Encompassing [in favor] and Knowing.\"",""
  2,248,"And their prophet said to them, \"Indeed, a sign of his kingship is that the chest will come to you in which is assurance[1] from your Lord and a remnant of what the family of Moses and the family of Aaron had left, carried by the angels. Indeed in that is a sign for you, if you are believers.\"","[1] Signs giving reassurance."
