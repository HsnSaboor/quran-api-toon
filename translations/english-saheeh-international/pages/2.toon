quran[5]{c,v,t,f}:
  2,1,"Alif, Lām, Meem.[1]","[1] These are among the fourteen opening letters which occur in various combinations at the beginning of twenty-nine sūrahs in the Qur’ān. Although there has been much speculation as to their meaning, it was not, in fact, revealed by Allāh to anyone and is known only to Him."
  2,2,"This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allāh[1] -","[1] Literally, \"those who have taqwā,\" i.e., who have piety, righteousness, fear and love of Allāh, and who take great care to avoid His displeasure."
  2,3,"Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer,[1] and spend out of what We[2] have provided for them,","[1] At its proper times and according to its specified conditions.\n[2] It is to be noted that the reference of Allāh (Subḥānahu wa taʿālā) to Himself as \"We\" in many Qur’ānic verses is necessarily understood in the Arabic language to denote grandeur and power, as opposed to the more intimate singular form \"I\" used in specific instances."
  2,4,"And who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muḥammad], and what was revealed before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].",""
  2,5,"Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.",""
