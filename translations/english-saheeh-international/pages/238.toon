quran[8]{c,v,t,f}:
  12,23,"And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him. She closed the doors and said, \"Come, you.\" He said, \"[I seek] the refuge of Allāh. Indeed, he[1] is my master, who has made good my residence. Indeed, wrongdoers will not succeed.\"","[1] Her husband, al-ʿAzeez."
  12,24,"And she certainly determined [to seduce] him, and he would have inclined to her had he not seen the proof [i.e., sign] of his Lord. And thus [it was] that We should avert from him evil and immorality. Indeed, he was of Our chosen servants.",""
  12,25,"And they both raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back, and they found her husband at the door. She said, \"What is the recompense of one who intended evil for your wife but that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment?\"",""
  12,26,"[Joseph] said, \"It was she who sought to seduce me.\" And a witness from her family testified, \"If his shirt is torn from the front, then she has told the truth, and he is of the liars.",""
  12,27,"But if his shirt is torn from the back, then she has lied, and he is of the truthful.\"",""
  12,28,"So when he [i.e., her husband] saw his shirt torn from the back, he said, \"Indeed, it is of your [i.e., women's] plan. Indeed, your plan is great [i.e., vehement].",""
  12,29,"Joseph, ignore this.[1] And, [my wife], ask forgiveness for your sin. Indeed, you were of the sinful.\"","[1] i.e., conceal it and act as if it had not taken place."
  12,30,"And women in the city said, \"The wife of al-ʿAzeez is seeking to seduce her slave boy; he has impassioned her with love. Indeed, we see her [to be] in clear error.\"",""
