  3,78,"And indeed, there is among them a party who alter the Scripture with their tongues so you may think it is from the Scripture, but it is not from the Scripture. And they say, \"This is from Allāh,\" but it is not from Allāh. And they speak untruth about Allāh while they know.",""
  3,79,"It is not for a human [prophet][1] that Allāh should give him the Scripture[2] and authority and prophethood and then he would say to the people, \"Be servants to me rather than Allāh,\" but [instead, he would say], \"Be pious scholars of the Lord because of what you have taught of the Scripture and because of what you have studied.\"","[1] Or any believer.\n[2] Or in the case of Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ), \"the Book\" (i.e., the Qur’ān) ."
  3,80,"Nor could he order you to take the angels and prophets as lords. Would he order you to disbelief after you had been Muslims?",""
  3,81,"And [recall, O People of the Scripture], when Allāh took the covenant of the prophets, [saying], \"Whatever I give you of the Scripture and wisdom and then there comes to you a messenger confirming what is with you, you [must] believe in him and support him.\" [Allāh] said, \"Have you acknowledged and taken upon that My commitment?\"[1] They said, \"We have acknowledged it.\" He said, \"Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses.\"","[1] i.e., Have you accepted this obligation?"
  3,82,"And whoever turned away after that - they were the defiantly disobedient.",""
  3,83,"So is it other than the religion of Allāh they desire, while to Him have submitted [all] those within the heavens and earth, willingly or by compulsion, and to Him they will be returned?",""
