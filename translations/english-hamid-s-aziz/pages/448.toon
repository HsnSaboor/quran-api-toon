quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"Who said, ´What! are you indeed of those who bear witness to (the truth)"
  37,53,"´What! When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then, indeed, be brought to judgment?´"
  37,54,"(A voice) Will say, \"Will you look down"
  37,55,Then he looked down and saw him in the midst of hell
  37,56,"He shall say (to the sceptic), \"By Allah! You had almost caused me to perish"
  37,57,"And had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought there"
  37,58,Is it then true that we shall not die
  37,59,Except our previous death? And that we shall not be chastised
  37,60,Most surely this is the supreme achievement
  37,61,For the like of this then let the workers work
  37,62,Is this better as an entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum (having bitter fruit)
  37,63,Surely We have made it to be a trial to the unjust
  37,64,Surely it is a tree that grows in the bottom of hell
  37,65,Its produce is as it were the heads of the serpents (or devils)
  37,66,"Then verily, they shall eat of it and fill (their) bellies with it"
  37,67,Then afterwards they shall drink a mixture prepared in boiling water
  37,68,Then most surely their return shall be to hell
  37,69,"Certainly, they found their fathers going astray"
  37,70,So in their footsteps they hasten on
  37,71,And certainly most of the ancients went astray before them
  37,72,And certainly We sent among them Warners
  37,73,Then see what was the end of those who were warned
  37,74,"Except the servants of Allah, the purified ones"
  37,75,"And Noah did certainly call upon Us, and the most gracious of Hearer of prayer are We"
  37,76,And We delivered him and his followers from the mighty distress
