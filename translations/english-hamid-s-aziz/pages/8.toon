quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  2,49,"When We saved you from Pharaoh´s people who sought to wreak evil and woe on you, slaughtering your sons and letting your women live; in that was a great trial for you from your Lord"
  2,50,When We divided for you the sea and saved you and drowned Pharaoh´s people while you looked on
  2,51,"When We treated with Moses forty nights, then you chose the calf after he had gone and you did wrong"
  2,52,Yet then We forgave you after that; perhaps you may be grateful
  2,53,And remember when We gave Moses the Scriptures and the Criterion; you had a chance to be guided
  2,54,"And remember when Moses said to his people, \"O my people! You have wronged yourselves in taking this calf; repent unto your Creator and kill the guilty yourselves; that will be better for you in your Creator´s eyes; and He relented towards you"
  2,55,"And remember when you said to Moses, \"O Moses! We will not believe in you until we see Allah manifestly,\" and the thunderbolt caught you while you yet looked on"
  2,56,Then We raised you up after your death; perhaps you may be grateful
  2,57,"And We overshadowed you with the cloud, and sent down the manna and the quails; \"Eat of the good things we have given you.\" They did not wrong Us, but it was themselves they were wronging"
