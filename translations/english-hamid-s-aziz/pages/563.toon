quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  67,13,And whether you conceal your opinion or express it; surely He is Aware of what is in the heart
  67,14,"Should He not know, He Who created? And He is the Knower of the Subtleties, the Aware"
  67,15,"He it is Who made the earth smooth (manageable) for you, therefore go about in the spacious paths thereof, and eat of His provisions, and to Him is the Resurrection after death"
  67,16,Have you taken security from Him Who is in heaven that He will not make the earth swallow you when it is shaken (convulsed)
  67,17,Or have you taken security from Him Who is in heaven that He will not send down upon you a hurricane so that you shall know how terrible was My warning
  67,18,"And verily those before them rejected the truth, then how terrible was My wrath"
  67,19,Have they not seen the birds above them expanding (their wings) and contracting (them)? What is it that withholds them save the Beneficent? Lo! He is Seer of all things
  67,20,Or who is it that will be an army to assist you besides the Beneficent? The unbelievers are in naught but delusion
  67,21,Or who is it that will provide you if He should withhold His sustenance? Nay! They persist in disdain and aversion (from truth)
  67,22,What! Is he who goes prone upon his face better guided or he who walks upright upon a Straight Way
  67,23,"Say, \"He it is Who brought you into being and made for you the faculties of hearing and seeing and heart: little is it that you give thanks"
  67,24,"Say, \"He it is Who multiplied you in the earth and to Him you shall be gathered"
  67,25,"And they say, \"When shall this promise be (fulfilled) if you are truthful"
  67,26,"Say, \" The knowledge thereof is only with Allah and I am only a plain Warner"
