quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,Nay! Most surely the record of the wicked is in Sijjin
  83,8,And what will explain to you what Sijjin is
  83,9,It is an inscribed Record
  83,10,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  83,11,Who give the lie to the Day of Judgment
  83,12,"And none deny it but the transgressors beyond bounds, the sinful one"
  83,13,"When Our revelations are recited to him, he says, \"Stories of those of yore"
  83,14,Nay! But what they used to do has become like rust upon their heart
  83,15,Nay! Most surely they shall on that day be debarred (or veiled) from their Lord
  83,16,Then most surely they shall enter the burning Fire
  83,17,"Then shall it be said, \"This is what you gave the lie to"
  83,18,Nay! Most surely the record of the righteous shall be in Iliyin
  83,19,And what will explain to you what Iliyin is
  83,20,It is an inscribed Record
  83,21,Those who are drawn near to Allah shall witness it
  83,22,Most surely the righteous shall be in bliss
  83,23,"On thrones, they shall gaze"
  83,24,You will see in their faces the brightness of bliss
  83,25,"They are given to drink pure wine, sealed"
  83,26,The sealing of it is with musk; and for that let the aspirers aspire
  83,27,And the admixture of it is a water of Tasnim
  83,28,A fountain from which drink they who are nearest to Allah
  83,29,Surely they who are guilty used to laugh at those who believe
  83,30,"And when they passed by them, they winked at one another"
  83,31,And when they returned to their own folk they returned exulting
  83,32,"And when they saw them, they said, \"Most surely these are truly astray"
  83,33,But they were not sent to be keepers over them
  83,34,This day it is the believers who shall laugh at the unbelievers
