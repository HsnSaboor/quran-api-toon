quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,When his Lord called upon him in the holy valley of Tuwa
  79,17,"(Saying,) \"Go to Pharaoh, surely he has transgressed beyond bounds"
  79,18,"Then say, \"Have you a desire to purify yourself"
  79,19,And I will guide you to your Lord so that you may fear
  79,20,So he showed him the Mighty Sign
  79,21,But he (Pharaoh) rejected it and disobeyed
  79,22,Then turned he away (from Allah) in haste
  79,23,Then he gathered (men) and made a proclamation
  79,24,"Saying, \"I am your Lord, the most high"
  79,25,So Allah seized him with the punishment of the Hereafter and the former life
  79,26,Most surely there is in this a lesson to him who fears
  79,27,Are you the harder to create or the heaven? He created it
  79,28,"He raised high its height, and gave it order and perfection"
  79,29,And He made dark its night and its splendour does He bring out with light
  79,30,And after that He expanded (spread) the earth
  79,31,He brought forth from it its water and its pasturage
  79,32,"And the mountains, He made them firm"
  79,33,A provision for you and for your cattle
  79,34,But when the great overwhelming calamity comes
  79,35,The Day on which man shall recollect all he strove after
  79,36,And Hell shall be made manifest to him who sees
  79,37,Then for him who has transgressed all bounds
  79,38,And prefers the life of this world
  79,39,"Surely, Hell will be his abode"
  79,40,And as for him who had feared standing in the presence of his Lord and restrains his soul from lust (or low desires)
  79,41,"Then surely the Garden, that is his abode"
  79,42,"They ask you (Muhammad) about the Hour, when it will come"
  79,43,"What,\" ask they, \"have you to say about it"
  79,44,To your Lord belongs the knowledge of it
  79,45,you are only a Warner to him who would fear it
  79,46,"On the day that they behold it, it will be as though they had not tarried but an evening or the morning"
