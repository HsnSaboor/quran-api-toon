quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,"None shall broil thereon, but the most wretched"
  92,16,Who says it is a lie and turns his back
  92,17,But the pious shall be kept away from it
  92,18,He who gives his wealth that he may grow
  92,19,And who gives no favour expecting a return
  92,20,But only desiring the face of his Lord Most High
  92,21,In the end he shall be well fulfilled
  93,1,By the glorious morning light
  93,2,And the night when it is still
  93,3,"Your Lord has not forsaken you (Muhammad), nor is displeased with you"
  93,4,And surely the Hereafter is better for you than the present
  93,5,"And in the end your Lord will give you, and you shall be well pleased"
  93,6,"Did He not find you an orphan, and give you protection"
  93,7,"And find you wandering (or astray), and guide you"
  93,8,"And find you in need, and enriched you (or made you independent)"
  93,9,"Therefore, the orphan oppress him not"
  93,10,Nor the beggar (or petitioner) drive away
  93,11,"And as for the favour of your Lord, discourse (proclaim) thereof"
  94,1,Have We not expanded for you your breast
  94,2,And set down from you your load
  94,3,Which galled your back
  94,4,And exalted for you your renown
  94,5,"Verily, with difficulty comes ease"
  94,6,"Verily, with difficulty comes ease"
  94,7,"So when you are at relieved, then still toil"
  94,8,And to your Lord turn all your yearning (or attention)
