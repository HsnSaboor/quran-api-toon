quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,That which they had to enjoy will avail them not
  26,208,But We destroy not any population but it had its Warners
  26,209,"For reminder, for We are never unjust"
  26,210,No devils (or evil ones) brought down this revelation (the Quran)
  26,211,It is not fit work for them; nor is it in their power to do so
  26,212,"Verily, they are banished from listening"
  26,213,"Therefore, call not upon gods other than Allah, lest you be of the doomed"
  26,214,But warn your people who are near of kin
  26,215,And lower your wing (in kindness and protection as the hen does over its chicks) to those of the believers who follow you
  26,216,"But if they rebel against you, say, \"Verily, I am innocent of what you do"
  26,217,"And put your trust (rely) upon the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,218,Who sees you when you do stand up (to pray)
  26,219,And your postures (or movements) among those who prostrate themselves (in obeisance)
  26,220,"Verily, He, only He, is the Hearer, the Knower"
  26,221,Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend
  26,222,They descend upon every wicked liar
  26,223,And impart what they have heard; but most of them are liars
  26,224,"As for poets, those follow them who are astray"
  26,225,Have you not seen how they wander confused in every valley (or by way)
  26,226,And that they say that which they do not do
  26,227,"Save those who believe and do good works, and remember Allah much, and defend themselves after they are wronged. Those who do wrong will come to know with what a turn they shall be turned"
