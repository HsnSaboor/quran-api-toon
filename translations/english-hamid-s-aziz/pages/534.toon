quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  55,68,In both are fruits and date-palms and pomegranates
  55,69,Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
  55,70,In them are goodly things and beautiful ones
  55,71,Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
  55,72,Pure ones confined to pavilions
  55,73,Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
  55,74,Man has not touched them before them nor jinn
  55,75,Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
  55,76,Reclining on green cushions and rich carpets of beauty
  55,77,Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
  55,78,"Blessed be the name of your Lord, Mighty and Glorious"
  56,1,When the Inevitable Event comes to pass
  56,2,There is no denying that it will come
  56,3,"Abasing some, exalting others"
  56,4,When the earth shall be shaken to its foundations
  56,5,And the mountains shall be crumbled
  56,6,So that they shall be as scattered dust
  56,7,And you shall be sorted into three classes
  56,8,First the companions of the right hand - what will be the companions of the right hand
  56,9,And then the companions of the left hand - what will be the companions of the left hand
  56,10,And those foremost (in faith) will be the foremost (in the Hereafter)
  56,11,These are they who are drawn nigh (to Allah)
  56,12,In the Gardens of Bliss
  56,13,A multitude of those of old
  56,14,And a few of those of later times
  56,15,On thrones decorated
  56,16,"Reclining on them, facing one another"
