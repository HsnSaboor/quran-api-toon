  42,52,"And thus did We reveal to you (Muhammad) an inspired Book by Our command. You did not know what the Book was, nor what the faith was, but We made it a light, guiding thereby whom We will of Our servants; and most surely you guide unto the Straight Way"
  42,53,"The Way of Allah, to Whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth; now surely to Allah do all affairs eventually come"

  43,2,By the Book that makes things clear
  43,3,Surely We have made it an Arabic Lecture (Quran) that you may understand
  43,4,"And surely it is in the Mother of the Books with Us, truly sublime, full of wisdom"
  43,5,"What! Shall We, then, turn away the Reminder (Quran) from you altogether because you are a wanton (transgressing) people"

  43,7,And there came not to them a prophet but they mocked at him
  43,8,"Then We destroyed those who were stronger than these in prowess, and the case of the ancients has gone before them"
