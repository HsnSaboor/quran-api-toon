quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,Nay! But you do love the fleeting Now
  75,21,And neglect the Hereafter
  75,22,Some faces on that Day shall be bright
  75,23,Looking to their Lord
  75,24,And other faces on that Day shall be gloomy
  75,25,Knowing that there will be made to befall them some great calamity
  75,26,Nay! When the soul comes up to the throat
  75,27,"And it is said, \"Who will be a magician (to restore him)"
  75,28,And he is sure that it is the time of parting
  75,29,And one leg will be tied to another (i.e. after death)
  75,30,To your Lord on that day shall be the driving
  75,31,"So he did not accept the truth, nor did he pray"
  75,32,But called the truth a lie and turned back
  75,33,"Then he went to his folk, arrogant"
  75,34,Nearer unto you and nearer (comes the doom)
  75,35,"Again, nearer unto you and nearer (comes the doom)"
  75,36,Does man think that he is to be left to wander aimless (or purposeless)
  75,37,Was he not a small seed in the seminal elements
  75,38,"Then he was a clot of blood, so He created (him) then made (him) perfect"
  75,39,"Then He made of him two kinds, the male and the female"
  75,40,Is not He able to give life to the dead
  76,1,"Was there not over man a long period of time when he was a thing unremembered (nothing, not worth mention)"
  76,2,"Surely We have created man from a small mingled life-germ; in order to try him, We made him hearing and seeing"
  76,3,"Surely We have shown him the way: he may be thankful or unthankful"
  76,4,Surely We have prepared for the unbelievers chains and yokes and a burning fire
  76,5,Surely the righteous shall drink of a cup the admixture of which is camphor
