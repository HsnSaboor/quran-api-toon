quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"And when it is said to them, \"Come, the Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for you\", they turn back their heads and you may see them turning away while they are inflated with pride"
  63,6,It is alike to them whether you beg forgiveness for them or do not beg forgiveness for them; Allah will never forgive them; surely Allah does not guide the transgressing people
  63,7,"They it is who say, \"Do not spend upon those who are with the Messenger of Allah.\" hoping that they will disperse (or break up). But to Allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, and the hypocrites understand not"
  63,8,"They say, \"If we return to Medina, the mighty will surely drive out the weaker there from; but Might belongs to Allah, and to His Messenger and to the believers, but the hypocrites know not"
  63,9,"O you who believe! Let not your wealth, or your children, divert you from the remembrance of Allah; and whoever does that, these are the losers"
  63,10,"And spend out of what We have given you before death comes to any of you, lest he should say, \"My Lord! Why did you not respite me for a little while longer, so that I could have given alms and been of the doers of good deeds"
  63,11,But Allah grants not respite to a soul when its appointed term has come and Allah is Aware of what you do
