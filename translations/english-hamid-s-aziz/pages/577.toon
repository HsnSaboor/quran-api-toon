quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,The intercession of no mediators shall avail them then
  74,49,What is then the matter with them that they turn away from the admonition
  74,50,As if they were frightened asses
  74,51,Fleeing from a lion
  74,52,Nay; every one of them desires that he may be given pages spread out (or open)
  74,53,Nay! But they do not fear the Hereafter
  74,54,Nay! This surely is an admonition
  74,55,"Let any who will, pay heed (or remember)"
  74,56,But none will remember (or heed) unless Allah wills. He is the source of fear (or righteousness) and the source of Mercy
  75,1,Nay! I swear by (or call to witness) the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,Nay! I swear by (or call to witness) the self-accusing soul
  75,3,Does man think that We shall not gather his bones
  75,4,Yea! We are able to make complete his very fingertips
  75,5,Nay! Man desires to give the lie to what is before him
  75,6,"He asks, \"When is the day of resurrection"
  75,7,So when the sight becomes dazzled
  75,8,And the moon becomes dark
  75,9,And the sun and the moon are brought together
  75,10,"Man shall say on that day, \"Whither can I flee for refuge"
  75,11,By no means! There shall be no place of refuge
  75,12,With your Lord alone shall on that day be the place of rest
  75,13,Man shall on that day be informed of what he sent before and what he put off
  75,14,Nay! Man is telling evidence against himself
  75,15,Though he puts forth his excuses
  75,16,Move not your tongue with it (the Quran) to make haste with it
  75,17,Surely it is for Us to collect it and to recite (or enact) it
  75,18,"Therefore when We have recited it, follow its recitation"
  75,19,"Nay, more, it is for Us to explain (and clarify) it"
