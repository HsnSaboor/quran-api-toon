quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,By the declining day
  103,2,"Verily, man is in a state of loss"
  103,3,"Save those who believe and do good works, and bid each other to truth, and bid each other endurance"
  104,1,Woe to every slanderous scandal-monger and backbiter
  104,2,Who collects wealth and counts it
  104,3,He thinks that his wealth can immortalize him
  104,4,Not so! He shall be hurled into El´Hutamah
  104,5,"Ah, what shall make you understand what El´Hutamah is"
  104,6,The Fire by Allah kindled
  104,7,Which leaps into the heart
  104,8,Lo! It closes in as a vault on them
  104,9,In outstretched columns
  105,1,See you not how your Lord dealt with the people of the elephant
  105,2,Did He not make their stratagem lead them astray
  105,3,And sent down on them birds in flocks
  105,4,To pelt them with stones of baked clay
  105,5,And make them like stalks left by herbage eaten down
