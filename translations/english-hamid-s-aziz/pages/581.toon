quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Did We not create you from a fluid regarded contemptible
  77,21,Which We laid in a safe abode (the womb)
  77,22,Till an appointed term
  77,23,Thus We arrange things - how well are We at arranging things
  77,24,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,25,Have We not made the earth draw together to itself
  77,26,The living and the dead
  77,27,"And placed therein lofty mountains, and given you to drink sweet water from them"
  77,28,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,29,Go on to that which you used to deny
  77,30,Go on to the smoke with three branches (or three fold shadow)
  77,31,Neither having the coolness of the shade nor availing against the flame
  77,32,Surely it sends up sparks like palaces
  77,33,As if they were tawny camels
  77,34,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,35,This is the day on which they shall not speak
  77,36,Nor are they permitted to make excuses (or pleas)
  77,37,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,38,"This is the Day of Decision: We have gathered you and those of yore"
  77,39,"So if you have a plan, plan against Me now"
  77,40,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,41,Surely those who guard against evil shall be amid shades and fountains
  77,42,And fruits such as they desire
  77,43,Eat and drink pleasantly because of what you did
  77,44,Surely thus do We reward the doers of good
  77,45,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,46,Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little; surely you are guilty
  77,47,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,48,"And when it is said to them, \"Bow down (in humility), they bow not"
  77,49,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,50,"In what announcement, then, after this, will they believe"
