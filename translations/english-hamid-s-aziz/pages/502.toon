  45,33,And the evil consequences of what they did shall become manifest to them and that which they mocked shall encompass them
  45,34,"And it shall be said, \"Today We forsake you as you neglected the meeting of this Day of yours and your abode is the Fire, and there are not for you any helpers"
  45,35,"That is because you took the Signs of Allah for a jest and the life of this world deceived you.\" So on that Day they shall not be brought forth from it, nor shall they be granted Grace"
  45,36,"Therefore to Allah is due all praise, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, the Lord of all worlds"
  45,37,"And unto Him alone belongs Majesty in the heavens and the earth, and He is the Mighty, the Wise"

  46,2,"The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise"
  46,3,We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them two save with Truth and for an appointed term; and those who disbelieve turn aside from what they are warned of
  46,4,"Say, \"Have you considered what you call upon besides Allah? Show me what they have created of the earth, or have they a share in the heavens? Bring me a Book before this or traces of knowledge (confirming this), if you are truthful"
  46,5,And who is in greater error than he who calls besides Allah upon those that will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection and they are heedless of their call
