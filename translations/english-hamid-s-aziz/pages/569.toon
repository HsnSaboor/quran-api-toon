quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,Though they shall be given sight of each other. The guilty one would fain redeem himself from the chastisement of that day by sacrificing his children
  70,12,And his wife and his brother
  70,13,And the nearest of his kinsfolk who gave him shelter
  70,14,"And all those that are in the earth, hoping to be delivered"
  70,15,By no means! Surely it is a flaming Fire
  70,16,Dragging him right to his skull
  70,17,It calls him who turned and fled from truth
  70,18,And amasses wealth then locks it up
  70,19,Surely man is created anxious (or impatient)
  70,20,Fretful when evil afflicts him
  70,21,And niggardly when good befalls him
  70,22,Except those who pray
  70,23,Those who are constant (or devoted) at their prayer
  70,24,And those in whose wealth there is a fixed portion
  70,25,For him who begs and for him who is destitute
  70,26,And those who accept the truth of the Day of Judgment
  70,27,And those who are fearful of the displeasure of their Lord
  70,28,Surely the displeasure of their Lord is a thing before which none can feel secure (or is the opposite of peace and tranquillity)
  70,29,And those who guard their chastity
  70,30,Except in the case of their wives or those whom their right hands possess - for on these surely is no blame
  70,31,"But he who seeks to go beyond this, these it is that transgress beyond bounds"
  70,32,And those who are faithful to their trusts and their covenant
  70,33,And those who are upright in their testimonies
  70,34,And those who keep guard (the sacredness of) their worship
  70,35,"Those shall be in Gardens, honoured"
  70,36,But what ails those who disbelieve that they rush around you (Muhammad) open-eyed (in mock amazement)
  70,37,"On the right hand and on the left, in sundry groups"
  70,38,Does every man of them desire that he should be made to enter the Garden of Bliss
  70,39,By no means! Surely We have created them of what they know (earth and spirit)
