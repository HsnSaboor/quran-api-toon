quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,"And that He created pairs, the male and the female"
  53,46,From the small seed when it is placed (or lodged)
  53,47,And that on Him depends (or He has ordained) the bringing forth a second time
  53,48,And that He it is Who enriches and gives satisfaction (or fulfilment)
  53,49,And that He is the Lord of Sirius
  53,50,And that He did destroy the A´ad of old
  53,51,And Thamud He spared not
  53,52,And the people of Noah before them; surely they were most unjust and insolent transgressors
  53,53,And He destroyed the Overthrown Cities (of Sodom and Gomorrah)
  53,54,So that they were covered with that which covers
  53,55,Then about which of your Lord´s gifts will you dispute
  53,56,This is a Warner of (the series or like) the Warners of old
  53,57,The threatened event (or Hour) draws nigh
  53,58,There is none besides Allah to disclose (or actualise) it
  53,59,Marvel you then at this announcement
  53,60,And will you laugh and not weep
  53,61,While you are indulging in vanities
  53,62,So make obeisance (or prostrations) to Allah and serve Him
  54,1,The hour drew nigh (or is nigh) and the moon was rent in twain (or is rent)
  54,2,"And if they see a Sign they turn aside and say, \"Transient magic"
  54,3,"And they call it a lie, and follow their own low desires; but every affair has its appointed term"
  54,4,And certainly some narratives have come to them wherein is a deterrent
  54,5,Consummate wisdom - but warnings avail not
  54,6,So turn your back on them for the Day when the Summoner summons them unto a terrible affair
