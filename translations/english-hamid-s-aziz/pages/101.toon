quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,141,"Those who lie in wait for you, and if the victory be your s from Allah, say, \"Were we not with you?\" and if the unbelievers have a chance of success, they say, \"Did we not gain an advantage over you, and defend you from the believers"
  4,142,"Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but He deceives them; and when they rise up to pray, they rise up lazily to be seen of men, and little do they remember Allah"
  4,143,"Wavering (in distraction) between this and that, (belonging) neither to these nor yet to those! But whomsoever Allah causes to go astray you shall not find for him a Way"
  4,144,O you who believe! Take not disbelievers for friends rather than believers; do you wish to give Allah a proof (or warrant) against you
  4,145,"Verily, the hypocrites are in the lowest depths of hell-fire, and you will not find for them a help"
  4,146,"Save those who repent, and do right, and take tight hold on Allah, and are sincere in religion for (or purify religion for) Allah; these are with the believers, and Allah will give to the believers mighty reward"
  4,147,"Why should Allah punish you, if you are grateful and believe? For Allah is Responsive and Aware"
