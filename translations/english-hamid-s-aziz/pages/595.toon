quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun and its noonday brightness
  91,2,And the moon when it follows him
  91,3,And the day when it displays him
  91,4,And the night when it covers him
  91,5,And the wondrous structure of the heavens and Him who built it
  91,6,And the earth and Who spread it
  91,7,And the soul and Who fashioned it
  91,8,And enlightened it with what is wrong and right for it
  91,9,He indeed is successful who causes it to grow (or purifies it)
  91,10,And he indeed is a failure who corrupts it
  91,11,The Thamud people denied (the Messenger) in their rebellious pride (or outrage)
  91,12,When the basest of them rose up
  91,13,"And the Messenger of Allah (Salih) said to them, \"(This is) Allah´s she-camel! So give her to drink"
  91,14,"But they called him a liar, and they ham-strung her; so their Lord destroyed them in their sins, and served them all alike"
  91,15,And He fears not the result thereof
  92,1,By the night when it veils
  92,2,And the day when it is displayed
  92,3,And by (the mystery) of male and female
  92,4,"Verily, your efforts are diverse"
  92,5,But as for him who gives alms and fears Allah
  92,6,And believes in goodness
  92,7,We will ease his way to ease
  92,8,But as for him who is niggardly and thinks himself independent (or self-sufficient)
  92,9,And calls the good a lie
  92,10,We will ease his way to misery (adversity)
  92,11,And his wealth shall not avail him when he falls down (into hell)
  92,12,"Verily, it is for Us to guide"
  92,13,"And, verily, Ours are the Latter and the Former life"
  92,14,"Therefore, I have warned you of a Fire that flames fiercely"
