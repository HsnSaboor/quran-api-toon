quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,"On thrones (of dignity), they will gaze"
  83,36,Are not the disbelievers rewarded for what they did
  84,1,When the heaven is rent asunder
  84,2,"And gives ear unto its Lord, and is dutiful"
  84,3,And when the earth is stretched out
  84,4,"And casts forth what is within it, and is emptied (or clean)"
  84,5,"And gives ear unto its Lord, and is dutiful"
  84,6,"O man! Verily, you are toiling on towards your Lord, painfully toiling; wherefore shall you meet Him"
  84,7,And as for him who is given his record in his right hand
  84,8,His account shall be taken with an easy reckoning
  84,9,And he shall go back to his people rejoicing
  84,10,But as for him who is given his book behind his back
  84,11,He shall call out for destruction
  84,12,But he shall broil in a blazing Fire
  84,13,"Verily, he was amongst his family joyful"
  84,14,"Verily, he thought that he should never return to Allah"
  84,15,"Nay, nay! Verily, his Lord did watch him"
  84,16,So I do call as witness the glow of sunset
  84,17,"Or the night, and its homing"
  84,18,Or the moon in her fullness
  84,19,You shall surely travel from stage to stage
  84,20,What ails them that they believe not
  84,21,"And, when the Quran is read to them, they fall not prostrate"
  84,22,"On the contrary, the unbelievers reject it"
  84,23,But Allah knows best the (malice) that they hide
  84,24,So announce to them the grievous woe
  84,25,Save those who believe and work right. For them is an unfailing reward
