quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,44,"Or do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are but like the cattle, nay, they are further astray in the path"
  25,45,Have you not seen how your Lord spreads the shadow? Had He willed He could have made it still - We make the sun its guide
  25,46,Then We contract it towards Us with a gradual contraction in easy stages
  25,47,"And He it is who made the night a covering for you; and sleep for repose, and made the day a resurrection"
  25,48,And He it is who sent the winds as glad tidings heralding His mercy; and We send down purifying water from the sky
  25,49,"That We may quicken therewith the dead land, and slake the thirst of the things We have created - beasts and men in great numbers"
  25,50,"And verily, We have repeated it (the lesson) in various ways among them that they may remember; but most of mankind begrudge aught save ingratitude"
  25,51,"But, had We pleased, We could have raised a Warner in every village (or population centre)"
  25,52,"So obey not the disbelievers, but strive against them herewith (with the Quran) with great endeavour"
  25,53,"He it is who has set free the two bodies of water (rivers and seas), one palatable and sweet, and the other salty and bitter, and has set a barrier between them, forbidding passage"
  25,54,"And He it is who has created man from water, and has appointed for him kindred by blood and kindred by marriage for your Lord is ever Powerful"
  25,55,Yet they worship beside Allah what can neither profit them nor harm them; but the disbeliever is ever a partisan of evil against his Lord
