quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"He said, \"What is your errand then, O Messengers"
  51,32,"They said, \"Surely we are sent to a guilty people"
  51,33,That we may send down upon them stone of clay (or brimstones)
  51,34,Sent forth from your Lord for the extravagant (those who transgress beyond bounds)
  51,35,Then We brought forth such believers as were therein
  51,36,But We found not therein but one house of those who had Surrendered (Muslims)
  51,37,And We left therein a sign for those who fear the grievous penalty
  51,38,And in Moses (was another sign). When We sent him to Pharaoh with clear authority
  51,39,"But he turned away with his forces and said, \"A sorcerer or a mad man"
  51,40,So We seized him and his hosts and hurled them into the sea and his was the blame
  51,41,And in A´ad (was another sign). When We sent upon them the destructive wind
  51,42,"It spared naught on which it blew, but made it like dust"
  51,43,"And in Thamud (was another sign). When it was said to them, \"Enjoy yourselves for a while"
  51,44,"But they revolted against the commandment of their Lord, so the rumbling (thunderbolt or stunning noise of an earthquake) overtook them while they looked"
  51,45,"And they were not able to rise up, nor could they defend themselves"
  51,46,"And the people of Noah (were also a sign) before that, surely they were a transgressing people"
  51,47,"And the heaven, We raised it high with power, and it is We that expand the vastness of space (or We are the expanders of it)"
  51,48,"And the earth, We have spread it out; how gracious was the Spreader thereof"
  51,49,"And of all things have We created pairs, that you may reflect (or receive instruction)"
  51,50,"Therefore flee unto Allah, surely I am a plain Warner to you from Him"
  51,51,"And set not up with Allah another God: surely I am a plain Warner to you from Him"
