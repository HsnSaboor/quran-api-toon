quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  26,112,"He said, \"What knowledge have I of what they were doing"
  26,113,"Their account is only with my Lord, if you but understood"
  26,114,And I am not here to drive away the believers
  26,115,I am only a plain Warner
  26,116,"They said, \"Verily, if you desist not, O Noah! you shall surely be of those who are stoned"
  26,117,"Said he, \"My Lord! Verily, my own people reject me"
  26,118,"Judge you between us openly, and deliver me and those of the believers who are with me"
  26,119,So We saved him and those with him in the laden ark
  26,120,Then We drowned the rest
  26,121,"Verily, in this indeed is a sign, yet most of them are not believers"
  26,122,"And, verily, your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,123,And (the people of) A´ad denied the messengers
  26,124,"When their brother Hud said to them, \"Will you not fear"
  26,125,"Verily, I am to you a faithful messenger"
  26,126,So keep your duty to Allah and obey me
  26,127,I ask of you no fee for it; my wage is only the concern of the Lord of the Worlds
  26,128,Do you build on every height a monument of vain delight
  26,129,And build you fine strong buildings that per chance (or possibly) you may be immortal
  26,130,"And when you seize by force, assault you like tyrants"
  26,131,Rather fear Allah and obey me
  26,132,And keep your duty to Him who has bestowed on you freely all that you know
  26,133,And has aided you with cattle and sons
  26,134,And gardens and springs
  26,135,"Verily, I fear for you the retribution of an awful day"
  26,136,"They said, \"It is the same to us if you admonish or are not of those who admonish"
