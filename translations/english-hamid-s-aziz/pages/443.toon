quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,And a sign to them is that We bear their offspring in the laden vessels (or their race in an ark through the flood)
  36,42,"And We have created for them the like of it, in which they ride"
  36,43,"And if We please, We can drown them, then there shall be no helper for them, nor shall they be rescued"
  36,44,Unless by mercy from Us and for enjoyment for a time
  36,45,"And when it is said to them, \"Guard against what is before you and what is behind you, that per chance (or possibly) you may find mercy.... (they are heedless)"
  36,46,And there comes not to them a sign from among the signs of their Lord but they turn away from it
  36,47,"And when it is said to them, \"Spend of that which Allah has given you\", those who disbelieve say to those who believe, \"Shall we feed him whom, if Allah please, He could feed? You are in naught but clear error"
  36,48,"And they say, \"When will this threat come to pass, if you are truthful"
  36,49,They wait not for aught but a single Shout (or Blast) which will surprise them while they yet dispute with one another
  36,50,"So they shall not be able to make a bequest, nor shall they return to their families"
  36,51,"And the trumpet shall be blown, when lo! From their graves they shall hasten on to their Lord"
  36,52,"They shall say, \"O woe to us! Who has raised us up from our sleeping-place? This is what the Beneficent Allah promised and the messengers told the truth"
  36,53,"It will be naught but a single Shout (or Blast), when lo! They shall all be brought before Us"
  36,54,So this day no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; and you shall not be rewarded aught but that which you did
