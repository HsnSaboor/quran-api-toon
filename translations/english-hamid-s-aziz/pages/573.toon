quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  72,14,"Some of us are those who have Surrendered (to Allah), and some of us are deviators. Those who have Surrender have surely taken the right path purposefully"
  72,15,"As for the deviators, they are the fuel of Hell"
  72,16,"If they should keep to the right way, We would certainly give them to drink of abundant water"
  72,17,"So that We might test them therewith. And whoever turns aside from the remembrance of his Lord, He will afflict him with a severe penalty"
  72,18,"The places of worship are only Allah´s, therefore call not upon any one along with Allah"
  72,19,"And yet when the servant of Allah stood up in prayer to Him, they crowded almost stifling him"
  72,20,"Say, \"I only call upon my Lord, and I do not associate any one with Him"
  72,21,"Say, \"I do not control for you evil or good"
  72,22,"Say, \"Surely no one can protect me against Allah, nor can I find besides Him any place of refuge"
  72,23,Unless I proclaim what I receive from Allah and His messages; and whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger surely he shall have the fire of Hell to abide therein for ever
  72,24,"Until when they see what they are promised, then shall they know who it is that is weaker in helpers and fewer in number"
  72,25,"Say, \"I do not know whether that which you are promised be nigh or whether my Lord will appoint for it a distant term"
  72,26,He is the Knower of the unseen! And He reveals unto none His secrets
  72,27,Except messengers whom He has chosen; and then He makes a guard to go before him and after him
  72,28,So that He may know that they have truly delivered the messages of their Lord. He encompasses what is with them and He keeps count of all things
