quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  54,7,"With downcast eyes, they come forth from their graves as if they were scattered locusts"
  54,8,"Hastening towards the Summoner. The unbelievers shall say, \"This is a hard day"
  54,9,"Before them the people of Noah rejected, yea they reject Our servant and called him mad, and he was driven away"
  54,10,"Therefore he called upon his Lord, \"I am overcome, come you then to help"
  54,11,So We opened the gates of heaven with water pouring forth
  54,12,And We caused water to gush forth from the land in springs; so the waters gathered together and rose according to a measure already ordained
  54,13,And We bore him on that (the Ark) which was made of planks and nails (or ties of palm-fibre)
  54,14,"Floating before Our eyes, a reward for him who was rejected"
  54,15,"And certainly We left it as a sign, but is there anyone that remembers (or takes heed)"
  54,16,How great was then My punishment after My warning
  54,17,"And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who will heed"
  54,18,"A´ad treated the truth as a lie, so how great was My punishment after My warning"
  54,19,Surely We sent on them a tornado in a day of violent disaster
  54,20,Tearing men away as if they were the trunks of palm-trees uprooted
  54,21,How great was then My punishment after My warning
  54,22,"And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who will heed"
  54,23,Thamud rejected the warning
  54,24,"So they said, \"What! A single mortal from among us! Shall we follow him? Most surely we shall then be in sure error and madness"
  54,25,Can it be that the reminder has been sent to him of all the people among us? Nay! He is an insolent liar
  54,26,"Ah, tomorrow shall they know who is the liar, the insolent one"
  54,27,"Surely We shall send them the she-camel as a trial; therefore, watch them and have patience"
