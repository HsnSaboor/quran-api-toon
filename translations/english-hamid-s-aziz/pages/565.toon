  68,17,"Surely We will try them as We tried the people of the garden, when they resolved to cut the produce in the morning"
  68,18,And were not willing to set aside a portion (for the poor)
  68,19,Then there encompassed it (the garden) a visitation from your Lord while they were sleeping
  68,20,"So it became as black, barren land"
  68,21,And they called out to each other in the morning (unaware of what had happened)
  68,22,"Saying, \"Go early to your tilth if you would cut the produce"
  68,23,"So they went, while they murmured to each other secretly"
  68,24,"Saying, \"Let no poor man enter it today besides you"
  68,25,"And in the morning they went, strong in this (evil) resolve"
  68,26,"But when they saw it (the garden), they said, \"Most surely we have gone astray"
  68,27,Nay! We are made to suffer privation
  68,28,"The best of them said, \"Did I not say to you, ´Why not glorify (Allah)?´"
  68,29,"They said, \"Glory be to our Lord, surely we were unjust"
  68,30,"Then some of them advanced against others, blaming each other"
  68,31,"Said they, \"O woe to us! Surely we were outrageous transgressors"
  68,32,"Maybe, our Lord will give us instead a garden better than this; lo! We beseech (or turn in repentance to) our Lord"

  68,36,What ails you? How do you judge
  68,37,Or have you a Book wherein you learn
  68,38,That you shall have through it whatever you choose
  68,39,"Or have you received from Us an agreement, confirmed by an oath, extending until the Day of Resurrection, that you shall have what you demand"
