quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,Of what do they question one another
  78,2,About the Great News
  78,3,About which they are in disagreement
  78,4,"Verily, they shall soon come to know"
  78,5,"Verily, verily, they shall soon come to know"
  78,6,Have We not made the earth an expanse
  78,7,And the mountains as projections (thereon)
  78,8,And created you in pairs
  78,9,And made your sleep for rest
  78,10,And made the night to be a covering
  78,11,And made the day for livelihood and activity
  78,12,And made above you seven firmaments (heavens)
  78,13,And placed therein a shining lamp (the Sun)
  78,14,And do We not send down from the clouds water in abundance
  78,15,That We may bring forth thereby corn and vegetable
  78,16,And gardens dense and luxuriant
  78,17,Surely the Day of Decision (or Sorting ) is a thing appointed
  78,18,The day on which the trumpet shall be blown so you shall come forth in hosts
  78,19,And the heaven shall be opened as if it were all doors
  78,20,And the mountains shall be moved off so that they shall remain a mere semblance
  78,21,Surely hell lies in ambush
  78,22,A destination for those who transgress the bounds
  78,23,Abiding therein for ages
  78,24,They shall not taste therein anything cool nor drink
  78,25,But boiling and intensely cold water
  78,26,Requital corresponding (or proportional to their state)
  78,27,Surely they feared not the account
  78,28,And called Our revelations a lie with strong denial
  78,29,And We have preserved all things in a Record
  78,30,So taste you (the fruits of your deeds)! For We will not add to you aught but torment
