quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  43,23,"And even so, We did not send before you (Muhammad) any Warner into any town, but those who led easy lives in it (the wealthy or leisured) said, \"Surely we found our fathers in a religion, and surely we will follow in their footsteps"
  43,24,"He (The Warner) said, \"What! Even if I bring to you a better guide than that in which you found your fathers?\" They said, \"Lo! We deny that you are sent (or that with which you are sent)"
  43,25,"So We inflicted retribution on them, then see how was the end of the rejecters"
  43,26,"And when Abraham said to his father and his people, \"Surely I am innocent of what you worship"
  43,27,"Save Him Who created me, for surely He will guide me"
  43,28,And he left it as a word to endure in his posterity that they may return (to Allah)
  43,29,Nay! I let them and their fathers enjoy life until there came to them the Truth and a Messenger making things clear
  43,30,"And when the Truth came to them they said, \"This is magic, and lo! We are disbelievers in it"
  43,31,"And they say, \"Why was not this Quran revealed to a man of importance in the two towns"
  43,32,"Will they distribute (portion out, administer) the mercy of your Lord? We distribute among them their livelihood in the life of this world, and We have exalted some of them above others in degrees, that some of them may take others in subjection (or take)"
  43,33,"And were it not that all mankind might have become of a single (evil) community (or way of life), We might well have assigned to those who blaspheme against the Beneficent silver for the roofs of their houses and the stairs by which they ascend"
