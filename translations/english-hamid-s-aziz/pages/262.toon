  15,1,ALIF LAM RA. Those are the ayats (signs or verses) of Revelation and of a clear Reading (Quran) (or that clarifies)
  15,2,Many a time will those who disbelieve wish they had surrendered (obeyed or been Muslims)
  15,3,"Leave them to eat and enjoy the good things of life and let hope beguile them, but they shall come to know"
  15,4,We never did destroy a community but there was a fixed term decreed for it
  15,5,"No nation can hasten on its appointed time, nor put it off"
  15,6,"But they say, \"O you to whom the Reminder (the Quran) has been sent down! Verily, you are possessed"
  15,7,Why do you not bring us the angels if you do tell the truth
  15,8,"We sent not down the angels save as a Fact (for a just or right cause, effect or reason); but then (if We did) they would have no respite"
  15,9,"Verily, We have revealed (sent down) the Reminder, and, verily, We are its Guardian"
  15,10,"We, verily, sent Messengers before you among the sects of men in past ages"

  15,12,Even so do We let it traverse the heart of the guilty
  15,13,"They will not believe therein, though the example of those of past times is before them"
  15,14,But had We opened to them a Gate of Heaven and they had continued to ascend through it
  15,15,"They would only say, \"Our eye-sight is only intoxicated; nay, we have been bewitched by sorcery (or hypnotized)"
