quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  21,11,"How many a community that had done wrong have We shattered, and raised up after it another people"
  21,12,"And when they perceived Our Might, behold, they tried to flee from it"
  21,13,"Flee not away, but return to what you delighted in, and to your dwellings, that you may be questioned"
  21,14,"Said they, \"O woe is us! Verily, we were wrong-doers"
  21,15,"And that ceased not to be their cry until We made them like mown down fields, extinct (or as smouldering ashes)"
  21,16,We did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between the two in play
  21,17,"Had We wished to find a pastime, We could have found it in (or nearer) Our Presence, if We would do such a thing"
  21,18,"Nay, We hurl the True against the False and it does break its head, and lo! It vanishes. But woe to you for what you attribute (to Allah)"
  21,19,"Unto Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth, and those who dwell in His Presence are not too proud to serve Him, nor do they weary"
  21,20,They glorify Him by night and day without intermission
  21,21,Or have they chosen gods from the earth who can raise the dead
  21,22,"Were there in both (heaven and earth) gods beside Allah, both would surely have been disordered. Glorified is Allah, the Lord of the Throne, above all they ascribe unto Him"
  21,23,"He can not be questioned concerning what He does, but They shall be questioned"
  21,24,"Have they chosen gods beside Him? Say, \"Bring your proofs. This is the reminder (Message) of those who are with me (Muhammad), and of those who were before me.\" Nay, most of them know not the truth, so they turn away"
