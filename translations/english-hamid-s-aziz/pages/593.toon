quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,I swear by (or call to witness) the dawn
  89,2,And by the nights twice five (of pilgrimage)
  89,3,And the even and the odd
  89,4,And the night when it passes on
  89,5,Is there not in these a lesson (evidence or admonition) for a man of understanding
  89,6,Have you not seen how your Lord did with the people of A´ad
  89,7,With the city of Iram of the lofty pillars
  89,8,The like of which has not been created in all the land
  89,9,And with the people of Thamud when they hewed the great stones in the valley
  89,10,"And with Pharaoh, Lord of the stakes"
  89,11,All these were outrageous in the land
  89,12,And did multiply wickedness therein
  89,13,"Therefore, your Lord poured out upon them the scourge of diverse torments"
  89,14,"Verily, your Lord is ever watchful"
  89,15,"Now as for man, whenever his Lord tries him and honours him and grants him favour, then he says, \"My Lord has honoured me"
  89,16,"But whenever he tries him and restricts his subsistence, then he says, \"My Lord despises me"
  89,17,"Nay, nay! But you do not honour the orphan"
  89,18,Nor do you urge each other to feed the poor
  89,19,And you devour the inheritance (of the weak) with greed
  89,20,And you love wealth with an abounding love
  89,21,"Nay, when the earth is crushed to pieces"
  89,22,"And your Lord comes with the angels, rank on rank"
  89,23,"And Hell is brought near on that Day, on that Day shall man remember! But how shall the remembrance profit him"
