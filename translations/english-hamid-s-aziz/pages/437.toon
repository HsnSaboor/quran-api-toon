  35,19,And the blind and the seeing are not alike
  35,20,Nor the darkness and the light
  35,21,Nor the shade and the heat
  35,22,"Neither are the living and the dead alike. Surely Allah makes whom He pleases hear, and you cannot make those hear who are in the graves"
  35,23,You (Muhammad) are naught but a Warner
