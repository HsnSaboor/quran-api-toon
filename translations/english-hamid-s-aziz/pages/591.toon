quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the heaven and by the night or (morning) star
  86,2,And what shall make you know what the night star is
  86,3,The star of piercing brightness
  86,4,"Verily, every soul has a guardian over it"
  86,5,Then let man look from what he is created
  86,6,He is created from a drop emitted
  86,7,Which comes out from between the loins and the breast bones
  86,8,"Surely, He is able to bring back (to life)"
  86,9,On the day when the secrets shall be tried
  86,10,And man shall have neither strength nor helper
  86,11,By the Firmament which returns in its rounds
  86,12,And the earth with its sprouting
  86,13,"Verily, this is indeed a discriminating word"
  86,14,And it is no frivolity
  86,15,"As for them, they do plot a scheme"
  86,16,But I plot my scheme too
  86,17,So give respite to the unbelievers; deal you gently with them for a while
  87,1,Glorify the name of your Guardian Lord most High
  87,2,Who created and makes order and proportion
  87,3,Who ordains Laws and Guides
  87,4,Who brings forth the pasture
  87,5,Then turns it to dusky stubble
  87,6,"We will teach you by degrees to declare (or recite), and you shall not forget"
  87,7,"Save what Allah wills. Verily, Lo! He knows the open and the hidden"
  87,8,And We will ease your way into the simple (path)
  87,9,"Therefore, remind men, for, verily, the reminder is useful"
  87,10,But he who fears will be mindful
  87,11,And the wretch will avoid it
  87,12,He will broil in the great Fire
  87,13,Wherein he shall neither die nor live
  87,14,He is successful who grows
  87,15,And remembers the name of his Lord and prays
