quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,78,"And certainly We sent messengers before you: there are some of them that We have mentioned to you and there are others whom We have not mentioned to you; and it was not meet for a messenger that he should bring a sign except with Allah´s permission"
  40,79,"Allah is He Who made the cattle for you that you may ride on some of them, and some of them you eat"
  40,80,"And there are many benefits for you in them, and that you may attain through them a want which is in your breasts, and are borne upon them as upon the ships"
  40,81,"And He shows you His signs: which then of Allah´s signs will you deny"
  40,82,"Have they not then journeyed in the land and seen how was the end of those before them? They were more numerous than these and greater in strength and in the traces they made in the earth, but what they earned availed them not"
  40,83,"Then when their messengers came to them with clear arguments, they exulted in what they had with them of knowledge, and there beset them that which they used to mock"
  40,84,"But when they saw Our punishment, they said, \"We believe in Allah alone and we deny what we used to associate with Him"
  40,85,"But their belief could not avail them when they had seen Our punishment; this is Allah´s law, which has indeed held true for His servants, and then the disbelievers perished (or were ruined)"
