quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,"What ails you, how is it that you judge"
  37,155,Will you not then reflect
  37,156,Or have you a clear authority
  37,157,"Then bring your book (writ, record), if you are truthful"
  37,158,And they assert a relationship between Him and the Jinn; and certainly the Jinn do know that they shall surely be brought forth
  37,159,Glory be to Allah from all that they attribute (unto Him)
  37,160,"But not so the servants of Allah, the purified ones"
  37,161,So surely you and what you worship
  37,162,Cannot lead into temptation anyone against Him
  37,163,Save him who will go to hell
  37,164,"(The angels or those who are ranged in ranks say,) \"And there is none of us but has an assigned place"
  37,165,"Verily, we, even we, are they who draw out in ranks"
  37,166,"Verily, we, even we, are they who declare the glory (of Allah)"
  37,167,And there are those who used to say
  37,168,Had we a reminder from those of yore
  37,169,We would certainly have been the single-minded servants of Allah
  37,170,But (now that it is come) they disbelieve in it; but they will come to know
  37,171,And certainly Our word has already gone forth before this unto Our servants sent
  37,172,That most surely they shall be helped
  37,173,And most surely Our host alone shall be the victorious ones
  37,174,"Therefore, turn away from them till a time"
  37,175,"And watch, for they will soon come to see"
  37,176,What! Would they then hasten Our chastisement
  37,177,"But when it descends on them, evil will then be the morning for those who have been warned"
  37,178,And turn away from them for a time
  37,179,"And watch, for they will soon come to see"
  37,180,"Glorified be your Lord, the Lord of Majesty, above all that which they attribute (unto Him)"
  37,181,And peace be unto those who are sent
  37,182,"And all praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds"
