quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  44,40,Assuredly the Day of Decision (or of Sorting) is the term appointed for all of them
  44,41,"The day on which friend can in naught avail friend, nor can they be helped"
  44,42,Save those on whom Allah has mercy; surely He is the Mighty the Merciful
  44,43,Behold the tree of Zaqqum
  44,44,Is the food of the sinful
  44,45,"Like molten brass, it shall boil in (their) bellies"
  44,46,Like the seesing of boiling water
  44,47,"(It will be said,) \"Seize him, then drag him down into the midst of hell"
  44,48,Then pour above his head of the torment of the boiling water
  44,49,"Saying, ´Taste; lo! You were forsooth the mighty, the noble"
  44,50,´Surely this is what you used to doubt!´
  44,51,Surely the righteous are in a secure place
  44,52,Amidst Gardens and springs
  44,53,"Attired in fine silk and rich brocade, face to face"
  44,54,"Thus shall it be, and We will join them with Houris (pure and beautiful companions) with wide, lovely eyes"
  44,55,They shall call in safety therein for every fruit
  44,56,"They taste not death therein except the first death (i.e. in this physical life), and He will have saved them from the doom of hell"
  44,57,A grace from your Lord; this is the supreme achievement (or triumph)
  44,58,Verily We have made it (the Quran) easy in your tongue that they may be mindful
  44,59,Therefore wait (O Muhammad); they too are waiting
