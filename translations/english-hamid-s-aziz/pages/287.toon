  17,51,"Or a created thing which, in your mind, is greater (or harder to reproduce) yet you shall be raised\" Then they shall say, \"Who is to restore us?\" Say, \"He who originated you at first;\" Then they will wag their heads and say"

  17,53,"And tell My servants to speak only that which is best (kindly, reasonably, truthfully, beautifully, usefully to enemy, friend and relative). Truly, Satan does sow dissension (or ill will) among them, for Satan is ever unto man an open foe"
  17,54,"Your Lord is best aware; if He please He will have mercy upon you, or if He please He will punish you. We have not sent you to take charge of them"

  17,56,"Say, \"Call on those other than Allah whom you assume to be gods.\" But they have no power to remove distress from you, nor to change it"
  17,57,"Those on whom they call, themselves seek for a means of approaching to their Lord, to see which of them is nearest: and they hope for His mercy and they fear His doom; verily, the doom of your Lord is to be shunned"
  17,58,"There is no community but We will destroy it before the Day of Judgment, or punish it with dire penalty. That is inscribed in the Eternal Book"
