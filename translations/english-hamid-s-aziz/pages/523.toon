quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  51,52,"Thus there did not come to those before them a messenger but they said, \"(He is) A sorcerer or a mad man"
  51,53,Is this the legacy (or tradition) they have transmitted to each other? Nay! They are a people extravagant (transgressing beyond bounds)
  51,54,Then turn your back upon them for you are not to blame
  51,55,"And continue to teach (or remind), for surely the reminder profits the believers"
  51,56,And I have not created the jinn and mankind except to worship (serve) Me
  51,57,"No sustenance do I require from them, nor do I require that they should feed Me"
  51,58,"Surely it is Allah Who is the Bestower of sustenance, the Lord of Power, the ever Steadfast"
  51,59,"And lo! Those who do wrong shall have a portion like the portion of those of earlier generations, therefore let them not ask Me to hasten"
  51,60,Woe to those who disbelieve because of their Day which they are promised
  52,1,(I swear) By the Mount
  52,2,By a Decree inscribed
  52,3,"On a fine parchment, unrolled"
  52,4,And the much visited House
  52,5,And the canopy exalted
  52,6,And the swollen sea
  52,7,Most surely the doom of your Lord will come to pass
  52,8,There shall be none to avert it
  52,9,On the day when the heaven shall heave with awful commotion
  52,10,And the mountains shall move with awful movement
  52,11,Then woe on that Day unto the deniers (of the truth)
  52,12,Those who sport in vain discourses
  52,13,The Day on which they shall be driven irresistibly to the Fire of Hell
  52,14,This is the Fire which you used to deny
