quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,And what is in the breasts is brought to light
  100,11,"Verily, your Lord upon that day indeed is well aware"
  101,1,The calamity
  101,2,What is the calamity
  101,3,And what will convey to you what the calamity is
  101,4,The day when men shall be like scattered moths
  101,5,And the mountains shall be like flocks of carded wool
  101,6,And as for him whose balance is heavy
  101,7,He shall be in a well-pleasing life
  101,8,But as for him whose balance is light
  101,9,His mother will be the Bereft and Hungry One
  101,10,And who shall convey to you what she is
  101,11,A raging fire
  102,1,The rivalry in worldly increase deludes you
  102,2,Till you visit the graves
  102,3,Nay! In the end you shall know
  102,4,And again Nay! In the end you shall know
  102,5,Nay! Did you but know with certain knowledge
  102,6,You shall surely see hell
  102,7,And again you shall surely see it with an eye of certainty
  102,8,Then you shall surely be asked about pleasure
