quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Your Lord does know that you stand in prayer nearly two-thirds of the night, and sometimes half of it, and sometimes a third of it, and so also do a party of those with you; and Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you are not able to keep"
  74,1,O you enveloped in your cloak
  74,2,Arise and warn
  74,3,And magnify your Lord
  74,4,And your cloak do purify
  74,5,And uncleanness do shun
  74,6,And bestow not favours that you may receive again with increase
  74,7,"And for the sake of your Lord, be patient"
  74,8,For when the trumpet is sounded
  74,9,"That, at that time, shall be a Day of distress"
  74,10,Far from easy for the unbelievers
  74,11,Leave Me alone to deal with him whom I created
  74,12,And gave vast riches
  74,13,And sons to be by his side
  74,14,And I adjusted the affairs of life to go smoothly and appropriately for him
  74,15,And yet he desires that I should add more
  74,16,By no means! For lo! He stubbornly opposes Our revelations
  74,17,Will impose on him a fearful doom
