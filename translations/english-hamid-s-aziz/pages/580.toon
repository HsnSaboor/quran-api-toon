quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  76,26,"And during part of the night adore Him, and glorify Him a long part of the night"
  76,27,But they love the transitory life and put away behind them (ignore the remembrance of) a grievous Day
  76,28,"We, even We created them and made firm their frame, and when We will We will replace them, bringing others like them in their stead"
  76,29,"Surely this is an admonition; whoever will, let him take a straight path to his Lord"
  76,30,"But you will not, except as Allah wills, surely Allah is Knower, Wise"
  76,31,"He makes whom He will enter into His mercy; and for evildoers, He has prepared a painful doom"
  77,1,I swear by (or call to witness) the emissary winds sent one after another for men´s benefit
  77,2,By the raging hurricanes
  77,3,Which scatter things far and wide
  77,4,And separate things one from another
  77,5,Then I swear by the angels who bring down the revelation (or message)
  77,6,To clarify or to warn
  77,7,Most surely what you are promised must come to pass
  77,8,So when the stars are made dim
  77,9,And when the heaven is rent asunder
  77,10,And when the mountains are carried away as dust
  77,11,And when the messengers are gathered at their appointed time
  77,12,To what Day are these signs appointed
  77,13,To the Day of Decision
  77,14,And what will make you comprehend what the day of decision is
  77,15,Woe on that day to the rejecters
  77,16,Did We not destroy the former generations
  77,17,Then did We follow them up with later ones
  77,18,Even thus shall We deal with the guilty
  77,19,Woe on that day to the rejecters
