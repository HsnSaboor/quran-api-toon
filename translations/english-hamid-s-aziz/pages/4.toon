quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindles a fire; and when it lights up all around, Allah goes off with their light, and leaves them in darkness that they cannot see"
  2,18,"Deaf, dumb, blind, and they shall not return"
  2,19,"Or like a storm-cloud from the sky, wherein is darkness and thunder and lightning; they put their fingers in their ears at the thunder-clap, for fear of death, for Allah encompasses the disbelievers"
  2,20,"The lightning well-nigh snatches off their sight, whenever it shines for them they walk therein; but when it is dark for them they halt; and if Allah willed He would go off with their hearing and their sight; verily, Allah is mighty over all"
  2,21,O you folk! Serve (adore) your Lord (Guardian) who created you and those before you; per chance (or possibly) you may fear evil (learn righteousness)
  2,22,"Who made the earth for you a bed and the heaven a canopy; and sent down from heaven water, and brought forth therewith fruits for your sustenance; so make no peers (rivals) for Allah, when you know better"
  2,23,"And if you are in doubt of what we have revealed unto Our servant, then bring a chapter like it, and call your witnesses other than Allah if you tell truth"
  2,24,"But if you do it not - and you surely cannot - then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for disbelievers"
