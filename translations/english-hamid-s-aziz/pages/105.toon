quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,171,"O you people of the Book! Do not commit excesses in your religion, nor say against Allah anything save the truth. The Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, was but the messenger of Allah and His Word, which He cast into Mary and a Spirit from Him; believe then"
  4,172,"The Messiah does surely not disdain to be a servant of Allah, nor do the angels who are nigh to Him; and whoever disdains His service and is too proud, He will gather them altogether to Himself"
  4,173,"But as for those who believe and do what is right, He will pay their due reward and will give increase to them from His Bounty. But as for those who are disdainful and arrogant, He will punish them with a grievous woe. Nor will they find, other than Allah"
  4,174,"O you people! Convincing Proof has come to you from your Lord, for We have sent down to you manifest light"
  4,175,"Then those who believe in Allah, and take tight hold of Him, He will admit them into His mercy and Grace; and He will guide them to Himself by a Straight Way"
