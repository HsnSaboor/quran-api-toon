quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,By the Fig and the Olive
  95,2,And by Mount Sinai
  95,3,And by this Safe City
  95,4,"Surely, We have created man in the best of moulds"
  95,5,Then We reduced him to the lowest of the low
  95,6,Save those who believe and act right; for theirs is a reward unfailing
  95,7,But what shall make you call the judgment after this a lie
  95,8,Is not Allah the most wise (just or conclusive) of judges
  96,1,"READ (or proclaim), in the name of your Lord! Who created"
  96,2,Created man from a clot
  96,3,"Read (or proclaim), for your Lord is most Bountiful"
  96,4,Who teaches by the pen
  96,5,Taught man what he did not know
  96,6,"Nay, verily, man is indeed rebellious"
  96,7,In that he thinks himself independent (or self-sufficient or rich)
  96,8,"Verily, unto your Lord is the return"
  96,9,Have you considered him who forbids
  96,10,A servant when he prays
  96,11,Have you considered if he were in guidance
  96,12,Or bade piety
  96,13,"Have you considered if he denied the truth, and turned his back"
  96,14,Does he not know that Allah can see
  96,15,"Nay, surely, if he does not desist, We will drag him by the forelock"
  96,16,The lying sinful forelock
  96,17,So let him call his council (or comrades)
  96,18,We will call the guards of Hell
  96,19,"Nay, obey him not, but adore and draw nigh (unto Allah)"
