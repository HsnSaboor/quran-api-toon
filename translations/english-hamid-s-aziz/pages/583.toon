quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,"Surely for the righteous is achievement (or success, self-fulfilment)"
  78,32,Gardens and vineyards
  78,33,"And those showing freshness of youth, equals in age"
  78,34,And a pure cup
  78,35,They shall not hear therein any vain words nor lying
  78,36,"A reward from your Lord, a gift according to reckoning (or sufficient)"
  78,37,"From the Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, the Beneficent Allah, with whom none can argue"
  78,38,The day on which the Spirit and the angels shall stand arrayed; they speak not except him whom the Beneficent permits and who speaks aright
  78,39,"That is the Day of Certain Reality, so whoever desires may take refuge with his Lord"
  78,40,"Surely We have warned you of a doom near at hand: the day when man shall see that which his two hands have sent before, and the unbeliever shall say, \"O! Would that I were dust"
  79,1,I swear by (or call to witness) those who tear out to destruction
  79,2,And by those rushing
  79,3,And by those who float
  79,4,Then press forward as in a race
  79,5,And those who regulate affairs
  79,6,The day on which the first trump resounds (or that which can quake shall quake)
  79,7,And others follow it
  79,8,Hearts on that day shall palpitate
  79,9,While eyes are cast down
  79,10,"They say, \"Shall we indeed be restored to our first state"
  79,11,What! When we are rotten bones
  79,12,"They said, \"That then would be a return, causing loss"
  79,13,But it shall be only a single cry
  79,14,When lo! They will be fully awake
  79,15,Has not there come to you the story of Moses
