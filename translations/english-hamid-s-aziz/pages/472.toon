  40,41,"And, O my people! How (strange) is it that I call you to salvation and you call me to the fire"
  40,42,"You call on me that I should disbelieve in (or blaspheme against) Allah and associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, and I call you to the Mighty, the most Forgiving"
  40,43,"Assuredly that to which you call me to has no claim to be called to in this world, nor in the Hereafter, and that our return is to Allah, and the extravagant (or transgressors, those who go beyond the limits) will be inmates of the Fire"
  40,44,"And you will remember what I say unto you, and I entrust my cause to Allah. Verily, Allah is Seer of his servants"

  40,46,"The Fire, they shall be brought before it morning and evening and on the Day when the Hour (of Judgment) shall come to pass, (it will be said,) \"Make Pharaoh´s people enter the severest penalty"
  40,47,"And when they shall contend one with another in the Fire, then the weak shall say to those who were proud, \"Surely we were your followers; will you then avert from us a portion of the fire"
  40,48,"Those who were proud shall say, \"Surely we are all in it: surely Allah has judged between His servants"
  40,49,"And those who are in the fire shall say to the keepers of Hell, \"Call upon your Lord that He may lighten to us one day of this punishment"
