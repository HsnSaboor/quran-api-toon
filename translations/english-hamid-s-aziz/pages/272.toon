quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  16,43,"And We have not sent before you any but men, whom We inspired - Ask you those who possess the Reminder (or the Message), if you know not yourselves"
  16,44,"With Manifest (clear) Signs and with Books of Prophecy; and We have sent down the Reminder to you too, that you may explain to men clearly what has been sent down to them, and that they may reflect"
  16,45,"Are those, who devise evil plots, secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them up, or that His Wrath will not seize them from whence they cannot perceive"
  16,46,"Or that He may not call them to account in the midst of their going to and fro, without the possibility of frustrating Him"
  16,47,"Or that He should seize them with a gradual wasting? Verily, your Lord is indeed Kind, Merciful"
  16,48,"Do they not look at Allah´s creations, even among (inanimate things) - how their shadows turn to the right or the left, in prostration (obeisance or submission) to Allah and they are humble (or shrinking)"
  16,49,"And unto Allah does prostration (obeisance) whatever is in the heavens and in the earth, whether living creature or angel; nor are they arrogant (inflated with pride)"
  16,50,"They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded"
  16,51,"And Allah says, \"Take not two gods; He is only one God; then fear Me, and Me alone"
  16,52,"To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and in the earth, and to Him is duty (obedience) due unceasingly (or religion is for Him fundamentally and forever). Will you then fear other than Allah"
  16,53,"And whatever favours you enjoy, they are from Allah; then, whenever distress touches you, unto Him you turn for succour"
  16,54,"Yet, when He removes the distress from you, lo! A party of you join partners with their Lord"
