quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"And if We send a wind and they see it to yellow (scorch the crop), they would after that certainly continue in their disbelief"
  30,52,For surely you can not make the dead to hear and you can not make the deaf to hear the call when they have turned away (or their backs to flee)
  30,53,Nor can you lead away the blind out of their error. you can not make to hear any but those who believe in Our revelations so that they Surrender (in Islam)
  30,54,"Allah is He Who created you from a state of weakness then He gave strength after weakness, then ordained weakness and grey hair after strength. He creates what He will, and He is the Knower, the Mighty"
  30,55,"And on the day when the Hour shall come, the guilty shall swear that they did not tarry but an hour - thus are they ever deceived"
  30,56,"And those who are given knowledge and faith will say, \"Certainly (indeed, in truth) you tarried according to the ordinance of Allah till the Day of Resurrection, so this is the Day of Resurrection, but you were not aware"
  30,57,"But on that day their excuse shall not profit those who were unjust, nor shall they be allowed to make amends"
  30,58,"Verily, We have set forth for men every kind of similitude (parable, example) in this Quran; and, indeed, if you should bring them a miracle, those who disbelieve would certainly say: You are naught but false claimants"
  30,59,Thus does Allah set a seal on the heart of those who know not
  30,60,Therefore be patient; surely the promise of Allah is true and let not those who have no certainty of faith shake your firmness
