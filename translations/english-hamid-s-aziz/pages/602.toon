quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,For the taming (civilizing) of the Qureysh
  106,2,Their covenant covers their caravans in winter and summer
  106,3,So let them serve the Lord of this house
  106,4,"Who feeds them against hunger, and makes them safe against fear"
  107,1,Have you considered him who calls the judgment (or Religion) a lie
  107,2,He it is who pushes the orphan away
  107,3,And urges not (others) to feed the needy
  107,4,But woe to those who pray
  107,5,But are careless in their prayers
  107,6,Who pretend for show
  107,7,Yet withhold small kindnesses (or necessaries)
  108,1,"Verily, We have given you (Muhammad) El Kauthar (The Fountain of Abundance)"
  108,2,So pray to your Lord and sacrifice
  108,3,"Verily, he who insults you shall be issueless (cut off)"
