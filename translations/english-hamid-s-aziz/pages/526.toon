quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,(I swear) By the star when it sets
  53,2,"Your companion (Muhammad) does not err, nor is he deceived (or astray or is misled)"
  53,3,Nor does he speak out of (his own) desire
  53,4,It (the Quran) is naught but revelation that is inspired (sent down to him)
  53,5,"Taught by one of mighty power, (The Archangel Gabriel)"
  53,6,Endowed with wisdom; for he appeared in clear vision
  53,7,While he was in the highest part of the horizon
  53,8,"Then he drew near, and descended"
  53,9,Until he was two bows distant or closer still
  53,10,And He revealed to His servant what He revealed
  53,11,The heart (of the Prophet) lied not in (making him see) what he saw
  53,12,What! Do you then dispute with him as to what he saw
  53,13,And certainly he saw him in another descent
  53,14,At the Lote-tree of the furthest boundary
  53,15,Near which is the Garden of Abode (or Presence)
  53,16,When that which shrouds (in mystery) covered the Lote-tree
  53,17,"The eye did not swerve, nor did it exceed the limit (or was over bold or went wrong)"
  53,18,Certainly he saw of the Greatest Signs of his Lord
  53,19,Have you seen Lat and Uzza
  53,20,"And Manat, the third, the last"
  53,21,What! For you the males and for Him the females
  53,22,This indeed is an unjust division
  53,23,"They are naught but names which you have named, you and your fathers; Allah has not sent for them any authority. They follow naught but conjecture and the low desires which their souls incline to, even though true guidance has come to them from their Lord"
  53,24,Or shall man have whatever whims he wishes
  53,25,Nay! To Allah belongs the after and the former life (or the End and the Beginning)
  53,26,"And how many so ever angels are in the heavens, their intercession does not avail at all except after Allah has given permission to whom He wills and chooses to accept"
