quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,"But they called him a liar, therefore they shall most surely be brought forth (to the doom)"
  37,128,"But not the servants of Allah, the purified ones"
  37,129,And We perpetuated to him among the later generations
  37,130,"(This blessing) \"Peace be on Elias"
  37,131,Even thus do We reward the doers of good
  37,132,Surely he was one of Our believing servants
  37,133,And Lot was most surely one of those sent
  37,134,"When We delivered him and his followers, everyone"
  37,135,Except an old woman who was amongst those who lingered behind
  37,136,Then We destroyed the others
  37,137,And most surely you pass by their (ruins) in the morning
  37,138,And at night; do you not then understand
  37,139,And Jonah was most surely of those sent
  37,140,When he ran away to a ship completely laden
  37,141,"Then he drew lots, but was of those rejected"
  37,142,And the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy
  37,143,But had it not been that he was of those who glorify (Us)
  37,144,He would certainly have tarried in its belly to the day when they are raised
  37,145,Then We cast him on to the desert shore while he was sick
  37,146,And We caused a gourd plant to grow above him
  37,147,And We sent him to a hundred thousand folk or more
  37,148,"And they believed; therefore, We gave them provision for a time"
  37,149,Now ask them (O Muhammad) has your Lord daughters while they have sons
  37,150,Or did We create the angels females while they were witnesses
  37,151,"Verily, it is of their own lies that they say"
  37,152,"Allah has begotten\"; and most surely they are liars"
  37,153,Has He chosen daughters in preference to sons
