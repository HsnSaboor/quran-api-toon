quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,Round about them shall serve youths of permanent freshness (immortal or never altering in age)
  56,18,With goblets and ewers and a cup filled from a pure fountain
  56,19,"They shall not suffer with headache thereby, nor shall they get intoxicated (or exhausted)"
  56,20,And fruits such as they choose
  56,21,And the flesh of fowl and any as they desire
  56,22,"And pure, beautiful companions"
  56,23,The like of the well-preserved pearls
  56,24,A reward for what they used to do
  56,25,They shall not hear therein vain or sinful discourse
  56,26,"Except the saying, \"Peace! Peace"
  56,27,And the companions of the right hand; what of the companions of the Right Hand
  56,28,Amid thornless Lote-trees
  56,29,And tall trees with clusters of flowers (or fruits) one above another
  56,30,And spreading shade
  56,31,And water flowing constantly
  56,32,And abundant fruit
  56,33,Neither intercepted nor forbidden
  56,34,And exalted thrones
  56,35,Surely We have created them into a new creation
  56,36,And made them virgins pure
  56,37,"Loving friends, equals in age"
  56,38,For the sake of the companions of the right hand
  56,39,A multitude of those of old
  56,40,And a multitude of those of later times
  56,41,And those of the left hand; what of those of the Left Hand
  56,42,In hot wind and boiling water
  56,43,And the shade of black smoke
  56,44,Neither cool nor honourable
  56,45,Surely they were before this made to live in ease and plenty
  56,46,And they persisted in the great violation (or great sin)
  56,47,"And they used to say, \"What! When we die and have become dust and bones, shall we then indeed be raised"
  56,48,Or our fathers of yore
  56,49,"Say, \"The first and the last"
  56,50,Shall most surely be gathered together for the appointed hour of a known day
