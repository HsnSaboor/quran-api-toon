quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and turned his back
  80,2,Because there came to him the blind man
  80,3,And what would make you know that he would grow (spiritually)
  80,4,Or that he might become heedful so that the reminder should profit him
  80,5,As for him who considers himself independent (or self-sufficient)
  80,6,To him do you attend
  80,7,Yet no blame is on you if he grow not (spiritually)
  80,8,And as to him who comes to you striving earnestly
  80,9,And with the fear of Allah in his heart
  80,10,From him were you unmindful (or distracted)
  80,11,"Nay! Verily, it is an admonishment (or a message of instructions)"
  80,12,So let whoever will pay heed to it
  80,13,It is in honoured books
  80,14,"Exalted, purified"
  80,15,Set down by scribes
  80,16,Noble and righteous
  80,17,Cursed (self-destroyed) is man! How ungrateful (to Allah) is he
  80,18,Of what stuff did He create him
  80,19,"Of a small seed; He created him, then gave him due proportions"
  80,20,Then He made his way easy for him
  80,21,Then He causes him to die and buries him in his grave
  80,22,"Then when He wills, He will raise him to life again"
  80,23,Nay; but man has not done that which He bade him
  80,24,Then let man consider his food
  80,25,That We pour down the water in abundance
  80,26,Then We cleave the earth
  80,27,Then We cause to grow therein the grain
  80,28,And grapes and clover
  80,29,And the olive and the palm
  80,30,And dense luxurious gardens
  80,31,And fruits and herbage
  80,32,A provision for you and for your cattle
  80,33,But when the Deafening Noise (cataclysm) comes
  80,34,The Day on which a man shall fly from his brother
  80,35,And his mother and his father
  80,36,And his spouse and his children
  80,37,Every man of them shall on that Day be occupied with concerns which will make him heedless of others
  80,38,Many faces on that Day shall be bright as dawn (or beaming with light)
  80,39,"Laughing, rejoicing"
  80,40,"And many faces on that Day, shall be covered with dust"
  80,41,Veiled in darkness
  80,42,"These are the disbelievers, the wicked"
