  6,152,"And draw not nigh unto the property of the orphan, except to improve it, until he reaches full age; and give weight and measure with justice - We place not a greater burden on the soul than he can bear - and when you speak (or give your word), then speak"
  6,153,"Verily, this is My Straight Way; so follow it. Follow not other ways, lest you part yourselves from His way. This is what He has ordained for you, per chance (or possibly) you may fear (and avoid evil)"
  6,154,"Moreover, We gave Moses the Book, completing for him who would do right, and an explanation and a guidance and a mercy, that per chance (or possibly) they might believe in the meeting with their Lord"
  6,155,And this is the Book which We have revealed as a blessing; so follow it and fear (be righteous) that per chance (or possibly) you may obtain mercy
  6,156,"Lest you say, \"The Book (Scripture) was only sent down to two sects before us; verily, we care naught for (or are unaware of) what they read"
  6,157,"Or, lest you should say, \"Had we had a Book (Scripture) revealed to us we should surely have been more guided than they;\" But now there is come to them a manifest sign from their Lord, and a guidance and a mercy; who then is more unjust (does greater wrong) than he who denies the Signs (revelations) of Allah, and turns away from them? We will reward those who turn from our Signs with a severe punishment because of their turning"
