quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,Most surely it is an honoured Quran
  56,78,In a book that is protected
  56,79,None shall touch it save the purified ones
  56,80,A revelation by the Lord of the worlds
  56,81,Do you then hold this announcement in contempt
  56,82,And make denial of it your means of subsistence
  56,83,Why then do you not (intervene) when the soul comes up to the throat (of a dying person)
  56,84,And you the while look on
  56,85,"And We are nearer to it (the soul) than you, but you see not"
  56,86,"Then why, if you are not under Our authority"
  56,87,"Force back (the soul), if you are truthful (about your independence)"
  56,88,Then if he is one of those Near to Allah
  56,89,(There is for him) Satisfaction and Bounty and a Garden of Bliss
  56,90,And if he is one of those on the Right Hand
  56,91,"Then (the salutation) \"Peace to you\" from the companions of the Right Hand"
  56,92,"And if he is one of the rejecters, the erring ones"
  56,93,He shall have an entertainment of boiling water
  56,94,And burning in Hell
  56,95,Most surely this is a certain truth (or the Truth of Certainty)
  56,96,"Therefore glorify the name of your Lord, the Supreme"
  57,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and the earth declares the glory of Allah, and He is the Mighty, the Wise"
  57,2,His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He gives life and causes death; and He has power over all things
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last and the Evident (or Outer) and the Imminent (or Hidden or Inner), and He is Aware of all things"
