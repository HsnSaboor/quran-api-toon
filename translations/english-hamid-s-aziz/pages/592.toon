quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,Nay! But you prefer the life of this world
  87,17,Although the Hereafter is better and more lasting
  87,18,"Verily, this was in the former books"
  87,19,The books of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,"Has the story reached you, of the overwhelming"
  88,2,Some faces on that day shall be humbled
  88,3,"Toiling, weary"
  88,4,While they broil upon a burning Fire
  88,5,While they drink from a boiling spring
  88,6,No food shall they have save from the bitter Dhari
  88,7,Which shall not nourish nor avail against hunger
  88,8,Other faces on that day shall be joyful
  88,9,Content with their past endeavours
  88,10,In a lofty (sublime) Garden
  88,11,Wherein they shall hear no foolish word
  88,12,Wherein is a flowing fountain
  88,13,Wherein are Thrones (of dignity) raised on high
  88,14,And goblets set down ready
  88,15,And cushions arranged
  88,16,And carpets spread
  88,17,"Do they not look then at the camel, how she is created"
  88,18,And at the heaven how it is raised high
  88,19,And at the mountains how they are set firm
  88,20,And at the earth how it is spread out
  88,21,"Therefore, remind them: for you are only one to remind"
  88,22,you are not in authority over them
  88,23,But such as turns his back and disbelieves
  88,24,Him will Allah punish with the greatest torment
  88,25,"Verily, unto us is their return"
  88,26,"And, verily, for Us is their accounting"
