quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  39,57,"Or should say, \"Had Allah guided me, I would certainly have been of those who are dutiful"
  39,58,"Or should say when it sees the punishment, \"O, if I only had another chance that I might be among the righteous"
  39,59,"(But the answer will be,) \"Nay! For My revelations came to you, but you rejected them, and were haughty and you were among the unbelievers"
  39,60,And on the Day of Resurrection you shall see those who lied against Allah; their faces shall be blackened. Is there not in hell an abode for the haughty
  39,61,"And Allah shall deliver those who guard (against evil) with their achievement; evil shall not touch them, nor shall they grieve"
  39,62,Allah is the Creator of all things and He is the Guardian and Disposer of all things
  39,63,"His are the keys of the heavens and the earth; and those who disbelieve in the revelations of Allah, these it is that are the losers"
  39,64,"Say, \"What! Do you then bid me serve others than Allah, O you ignorant (or stupid) ones"
  39,65,"And certainly, it has been revealed to you and to those before you, \"Surely if you ascribe partners (with Allah), your work would certainly come to naught and you would certainly be of the losers"
  39,66,Nay! But serve Allah alone and be of the thankful
  39,67,"And they have not honoured Allah with the honour that is due to Him; and the whole earth shall be in His grip on the Day of Resurrection and the heavens rolled up in His right hand; Glorified is He, and High Exalted above all that they ascribe as partners"
