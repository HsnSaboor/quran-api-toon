quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  76,6,"A fountain from which the servants of Allah shall drink, flows with abundance"
  76,7,Because they fulfil their vows and fear a day the evil of which spreads far and wide
  76,8,And they give food out of love for Allah to the poor and the orphan and the captive
  76,9,(Saying) We only feed you for Allah´s sake; we desire from you neither reward nor thanks
  76,10,"Surely we fear from our Lord a stern, distressful day"
  76,11,Therefore Allah will deliver them from the evil of that day and will shed on them the Light of Beauty and Joy
  76,12,"And reward them, because they were patient, with a Garden and garments of silk"
  76,13,"Reclining therein on raised couches, they shall find therein neither the severe heat of the sun nor intense cold"
  76,14,"And shade thereof is close upon them, and clustered fruits thereof bow down"
  76,15,And amongst them shall be passed vessels of silver and goblets of crystal
  76,16,(Transparent as) glass but made of silver; they will determine the measure thereof
  76,17,And they will be given to drink therein a cup whereof the mixture is of Zanjabil
  76,18,From a fountain therein named Salsabil
  76,19,And they will be served by youths never altering in age; when you see them you will think them to be scattered pearls
  76,20,"And when you look, you will see blessings and a magnificent kingdom"
  76,21,"Upon them will be garments of fine green silk and gold brocade, and they shall be adorned with bracelets of silver, and their Lord will give them a drink pure and holy"
  76,22,"Lo! This is a reward for you, and your striving has been recognised and accepted"
  76,23,"Lo! We, even We have revealed the Quran to you in stages"
  76,24,"Therefore wait patiently for the command of your Lord, and obey not from among them one who is guilty or ungrateful"
  76,25,And glorify the name of your Lord morning and evening
