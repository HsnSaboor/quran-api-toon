quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun is overthrown (or folded up)
  81,2,And when the stars darken
  81,3,And when the mountains pass away
  81,4,And when the she-camels (with young) are left untended
  81,5,And when the wild beasts are herded together
  81,6,And when the seas swell and boil
  81,7,And when souls are sorted and reunited
  81,8,And when the female infant buried alive is asked
  81,9,For what sin she was killed
  81,10,And when the Record Books are spread open
  81,11,And when the heavens are unveiled
  81,12,And when Hell is kindled up
  81,13,And when the Garden is brought nigh
  81,14,Every soul shall then know what it has prepared
  81,15,But nay! I swear by (or call to witness) the Planets
  81,16,That run their course and hide themselves
  81,17,And the Night when it departs
  81,18,And the Dawn when it breaths away the darkness
  81,19,Most surely it is the Word of an honourable Messenger
  81,20,The possessor of power and high rank with the Lord of the Throne
  81,21,"One to be obeyed, and faithful to his trust"
  81,22,And your companion is not one possessed (or mad)
  81,23,And of a truth he saw himself on the clear horizon
  81,24,Nor is he a tenacious concealer of the unseen
  81,25,Nor is it the word of the cursed Satan
  81,26,Whither then will you go
  81,27,It is naught but a reminder unto all creation (or all the worlds)
  81,28,For him among you who wills to go straight
  81,29,"And you will not, unless Allah wills, the Lord (or Cherisher) of Creation (or all the Worlds)"
