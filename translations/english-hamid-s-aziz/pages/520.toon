quran[16]{c,v,t}:
  50,36,And how many a generation did We destroy before them who were mightier in prowess than they. Then they wander through (or overrun) the land; but was there for them a place of refuge (when the Judgment came)
  50,37,Most surely there is a reminder in this for him who has a heart or he gives ear and is a witness (or understands intelligently)
  50,38,And certainly We created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six periods and there touched Us not any fatigue (Allah required no rest)
  50,39,"Therefore be patient of what they say, and sing the praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting"
  50,40,And glorify Him in the night and after the prescribed prostrations
  50,41,And listen for the Day when the Caller shall cry from a near place
  50,42,The Day when they shall hear the Call (or Cry or Blast) in truth; that is the day of coming forth
  50,43,"Surely We give life and cause to die, and to Us is the final destination (or goal)"
  50,44,"The day on which the earth shall be rent asunder from under them, they will hasten forth; that will be a gathering together easy to Us"
  50,45,"We know best what they say, and you (O Muhammad) are not one to compel them; but admonish by means of the Quran him who fears My warning"
  51,1,(I swear) By the wind that scatters far and wide
  51,2,And those that lift and bear heavy loads
  51,3,And those that flow with ease and gentleness
  51,4,And those that distribute and apportion by Our command
  51,5,That of which you are warned is most surely true
  51,6,And the judgment must most surely come about
