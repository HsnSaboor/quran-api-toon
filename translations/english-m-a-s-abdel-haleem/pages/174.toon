quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  7,179,"We have created many jinn and people who are destined for Hell, with hearts they do not use for comprehension, eyes they do not use for sight, ears they do not use for hearing. They are like cattle, no, even further astray: these are the ones who are entirely heedless"
  7,180,"The Most Excellent Names belong to God: use them to call on Him, and keep away from those who abuse them- they will be requited for what they do"
  7,181,Among those We created are a group of people who guide with truth and act justly according to it
  7,182,"But We lead on those who reject Our messages, step by step, without them realizing it"
  7,183,"I will give them respite, but My plan is sure"
  7,184,Has it not occurred to them that their companion is not mad but is giving clear warning
  7,185,"Have they not contemplated the realm of the heavens and earth and all that God created, and that the end of their time might be near? What [other revelation] will they believe in if they do not believe in this"
  7,186,"No one can guide those God allows to stray: He leaves them blundering about in their insolence"
  7,187,"They ask you [Prophet] about the Hour, ‘When will it happen?’ Say, ‘My Lord alone has knowledge of it: He alone will reveal when its time will come, a time that is momentous in both the heavens and earth. All too suddenly it will come upon you.’ They ask you about it as if you were eager [to find out]. Say, ‘God alone has knowledge of [when it will come], though most people do not realize it.’"
