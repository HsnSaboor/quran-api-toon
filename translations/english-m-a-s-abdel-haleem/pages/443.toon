quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,Another sign for them is that We carried their seed in the laden Ark
  36,42,and We have made similar things for them to ride in
  36,43,"If We wished, We could drown them, and there would be no one to help them: they could not be saved"
  36,44,Only by Our mercy could they be reprieved to enjoy life for a while
  36,45,"Yet when they are told, ‘Beware of what lies before and behind you, so that you may be given mercy,’"
  36,46,they ignore every single sign that comes to them from their Lord

  36,48,"And they say, ‘When will this promise be fulfilled, if what you say is true?’"
  36,49,But all they are waiting for is a single blast that will overtake them while they are still arguing with each other
  36,50,"They will have no time to make bequests, nor will they have the chance to return to their own people"

  36,53,It was just one single blast and then- lo and behold!- they were all brought before Us
  36,54,"‘Today, no soul will be wronged in the least: you will only be repaid for your deeds"
