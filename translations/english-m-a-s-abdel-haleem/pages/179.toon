quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  8,17,"It was not you who killed them but God, and when you [Prophet] threw [sand at them] it was not your throw [that defeated them] but God’s, to do the believers a favour: God is all seeing and all knowing"
  8,18,‘That is what you get!’––and God will weaken the disbelievers’ designs
  8,19,"[Disbelievers], if you were seeking a decision, now you have witnessed one: if you stop here, it will be better for you. If you return, so shall We, and your forces, though greater in number, will be of no use to you. God is with the believers"
  8,20,"Believers, obey God and His Messenger: do not turn away when you are listening to him"
  8,21,"do not be like those who say, ‘We heard,’ though in fact they were not listening"
  8,22,"the worst creatures in God’s eyes are those who are [wilfully] deaf and dumb, who do not reason"
  8,23,"If God had known there was any good in them, He would have made them hear, but even if He had, they would still have turned away and taken no notice"
  8,24,"Believers, respond to God and His Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life. Know that God comes between a man and his heart, and that you will be gathered to Him"
  8,25,"Beware of discord that harms not only the wrongdoers among you: know that God is severe in His punishment"
