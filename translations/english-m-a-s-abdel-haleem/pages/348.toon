quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,90,"The fact is, We brought them the truth and they are lying"
  23,91,"God has never had a child. Nor is there any god beside Him- if there were, each god would have taken his creation aside and tried to overcome the others. May God be exalted above what they describe"
  23,92,He knows what is not seen as well as what is seen; He is far above any partner they claim for Him
  23,93,"Say, ‘Lord, if You are going to show me the punishment You have promised them"
  23,94,"then Lord, do not include me among the evildoers!’"
  23,95,We certainly are able to show you the punishment We have promised them
  23,96,Repel evil with good- We are well aware of what they attribute to Us
  23,97,"and say, ‘Lord, I take refuge with You from the goadings of the evil ones"
  23,98,"I seek refuge with you, Lord, so that they may not come near me.’"
  23,99,"When death comes to one of them, he cries, ‘My Lord, let me return"
  23,100,"so as to make amends for the things I neglected.’ Never! This will not go beyond his words: a barrier stands behind such people until the very Day they are resurrected"
  23,101,"On that Day when the Trumpet is blown, the ties between them will be as nothing and they will not ask about each other"
  23,102,those whose good deeds weigh heavy will be successful
  23,103,but those whose balance is light will have lost their souls for ever and will stay in Hell
  23,104,the Fire will scorch their faces and their lips will be twisted in pain
