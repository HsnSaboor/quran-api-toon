quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,23,"Intercession will not work with Him, except by those to whom He gives permission.’ They will be asked, after the terror is lifted from their hearts [on the Day of Judgement], ‘What did your Lord speak?’ and they will answer, ‘The Truth. He is the Most High, the Most Great.’"
  34,24,"Say [Prophet], ‘Who gives you sustenance from the heavens and earth?’ Say, ‘God does,’ and ‘[One party of us] must be rightly guided and the other clearly astray.’"
  34,25,"Say, ‘You will not be ques-tioned about our sins, nor will we be questioned about what you do.’"
  34,26,"Say, ‘Our Lord will gather us together, then He will judge justly between us; He alone is the All Knowing Judge.’"
  34,27,"Say, ‘Show me those you joined to Him as partners. No indeed! He alone is God, the Almighty, the All Wise.’"
  34,28,"We have sent you [Prophet] only to bring good news and warning to all people, but most of them do not understand"
  34,29,"And they say, ‘If what you say is true, when will this promise be fulfilled?’"
  34,30,"Say, ‘You have an appointment for a Day which you cannot put off nor bring forward, even by a single moment.’"
  34,31,"The disbelievers say, ‘We will believe neither this Qur an nor the Scriptures that came before it.’ If only you could see [Prophet] how the wrongdoers will be made to stand before their Lord, hurling reproaches at one another. Those who were oppressed will say to the oppressors, ‘If it were not for you, we would have been believers.’"
