quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Have you considered the man who rejects Our revelation, who says, ‘I will certainly be given wealth and children’"
  19,78,Has he penetrated the unknown or received a pledge to that effect from the Lord of Mercy
  19,79,No! We shall certainly record what he says and prolong his punishment
  19,80,We shall inherit from him all that he speaks of and he will come to Us all alone
  19,81,They have taken other gods beside God to give them strength
  19,82,but these gods will reject their worship and will even turn against them
  19,83,"Have you [Prophet] not seen how We send devils to incite the disbelievers to sin"
  19,84,"There is no need for you to be impatient concerning them: We are counting down their [allotted] time"
  19,85,On the Day We gather the righteous as an honoured company before the Lord of Mercy
  19,86,and drive the sinful like a thirsty herd into Hell
  19,87,no one will have power to intercede except for those who have permission from the Lord of Mercy
  19,88,"The disbelievers say, ‘The Lord of Mercy has offspring.’"
  19,89,How terrible is this thing you assert
  19,90,"it almost causes the heavens to be torn apart, the earth to split asunder, the mountains to crumble to pieces"
  19,91,that they attribute offspring to the Lord of Mercy
  19,92,"It does not befit the Lord of Mercy [to have offspring]"
  19,93,there is no one in the heavens or earth who will not come to the Lord of Mercy as a servant
  19,94,"He has counted them all: He has numbered them exactly"
  19,95,and they will each return to Him on the Day of Resurrection all alone
