  11,15,"If any desire [only] the life of this world with all its finery, We shall repay them in full in this life for their deeds- they will be given no less"
  11,16,"but such people will have nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire: their work here will be fruitless and their deeds futile"
  11,17,"Can they be compared to those who have clear proof from their Lord, recited by a witness from Him, and before it the Book of Moses, as a guide and mercy? These people believe in it, whereas those groups that deny its truth are promised the Fire. So have no doubt about it [Prophet]: it is the Truth from your Lord, though most people do not believe so"
  11,18,"Who could do more wrong than someone who invents lies about God? Such people will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, ‘These are the ones that lied about their Lord.’ God’s rejection is the due of those who do such wrong"
  11,19,"who hinder others from God’s path, trying to make it crooked, and deny the life to come"
