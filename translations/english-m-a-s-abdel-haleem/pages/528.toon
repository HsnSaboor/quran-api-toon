quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  53,45,"that He Himself created the two sexes, male and female"
  53,46,from an ejected drop of sperm
  53,47,that He will undertake the second Creation
  53,48,that it is He who gives wealth and possessions
  53,49,that He is the Lord of Sirius
  53,50,"that it was He who destroyed, in their entirety, ancient 'Ad"
  53,51,and Thamud
  53,52,and before them the people of Noah who were even more unjust and insolent
  53,53,that it was He who brought down the ruined cities
  53,54,and enveloped them in the punishment He ordained for them
  53,55,Which then of your Lord’s blessings do you deny
  53,56,This is a warning just like the warnings sent in former times
  53,57,The imminent Hour draws near
  53,58,and only God can disclose it
  53,59,"Do you [people] marvel at this"
  53,60,Why do you laugh instead of weeping
  53,61,Why do you pay no heed
  53,62,Bow down before God and worship
  54,1,The Hour draws near; the moon is split in two
  54,2,"Whenever the disbelievers see a sign, they turn away and say, ‘Same old sorcery!’"
  54,3,They reject the truth and follow their own desires––everything is recorded––
  54,4,although warning tales that should have restrained them have come down to them––
  54,5,farreaching wisdom––but these warnings do not help
  54,6,"so [Prophet] turn away from them. On the Day the Summoner will summon them to a horrific event"
