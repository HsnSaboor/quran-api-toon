quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  75,20,"Truly you [people] love this fleeting world"
  75,21,and neglect the life to come
  75,22,On that Day there will be radiant faces
  75,23,looking towards their Lord
  75,24,and on that Day there will be the sad and despairing faces
  75,25,of those who realize that a great calamity is about to befall them
  75,26,"Truly, when the soul reaches the collarbone"
  75,27,"when it is said, ‘Could any charm-healer save him now?’"
  75,28,when he knows it is the final parting
  75,29,when his legs are brought together
  75,30,on that day he will be driven towards your Lord
  75,31,He neither believed nor prayed
  75,32,but denied the truth and turned away
  75,33,walking back to his people with a conceited swagger
  75,34,Closer and closer it comes to you
  75,35,Closer and closer still
  75,36,Does man think he will be left alone
  75,37,Was he not just a drop of spilt-out sperm
  75,38,"which became a clinging form, which God shaped in due proportion"
  75,39,"fashioning from it the two sexes, male and female"
  75,40,Does He who can do this not have the power to bring the dead back to life
  76,1,Was there not a period of time when man was nothing to speak of
  76,2,We created man from a drop of mingled fluid to put him to the test; We gave him hearing and sight
  76,3,"We guided him to the right path, whether he was grateful or not"
  76,4,"We have prepared chains, iron collars, and blazing Fire for the disbelievers, but"
  76,5,the righteous will have a drink mixed with kafur
