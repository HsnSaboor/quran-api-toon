quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  58,12,"You who believe, when you come to speak privately with the Messenger, offer something in charity before your conversation: that is better for you and purer. If you do not have the means, God is most forgiving and merciful"
  58,13,"Were you afraid to give charity before consulting the Prophet? Since you did not give charity, and God has relented towards you, you should [at least] observe your prayers, pay the prescribed alms, and obey God and His Messenger: God is well aware of your actions"
  58,14,"Have you not seen [Prophet] those who give their loyalty to people with whom God is angry? They are neither with you nor with them, and knowingly swear to lies"
  58,15,"God has prepared a severe torment for them: what they do is truly evil"
  58,16,"They have used their oaths to cover up [their false deeds], and barred others from the path of God. A humiliating torment awaits them"
