quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  15,1,"Alif Lam Ra These are the verses of the Scripture, a Quran that makes things clear"
  15,2,The disbelievers may well come to wish they had submitted to God
  15,3,"so [Prophet] leave them to eat and enjoy themselves. Let [false] hopes distract them: they will come to know"
  15,4,Never have We destroyed a community that did not have a set time
  15,5,"no community can bring its time forward, nor delay it"
  15,6,"They say, ‘Receiver of this Quran! You are definitely mad"
  15,7,"Why do you not bring us the angels, if you are telling the truth?’"
  15,8,But We send down the angels only to bring justice and then these people will not be reprieved
  15,9,"We have sent down the Quran Ourself, and We Ourself will guard it. Even before you [Prophet]"
  15,10,We sent messengers among the various communities of old
  15,11,but they mocked every single messenger that came to them
  15,12,in this way We make the message slip through the hearts of evildoers
  15,13,They will not believe in it. That was what happened with the peoples of long ago
  15,14,"and even if We opened a gateway into Heaven for them and they rose through it, higher and higher"
  15,15,"they would still say, ‘Our eyes are hallucinating. We are bewitched.’"
