quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  41,21,"They will say to their skins, ‘Why did you testify against us?’ and their skins will reply, ‘God, who gave speech to everything, has given us speech- it was He who created you the first time and to Him you have been returned"
  41,22,"yet you did not try to hide yourselves from your ears, eyes, and skin to prevent them from testifying against you. You thought that God did not know about much of what you were doing"
  41,23,"so it was the thoughts you entertained about your Lord that led to your ruin, and you became losers.’"
  41,24,"The Fire will still be their home, even if they resign themselves to patience, and if they pray to be allowed to make amends, they will not be given permission to do so"
  41,25,"We have appointed, for the disbelievers, companions who make their past and present seem fair and right to them, but the sentence has already been passed on them, along with generations of jinn and men before them: they were losers"
  41,26,"The disbelievers say, ‘Do not listen to this Quran; drown it in frivolous talk: you may gain the upper hand.’"
  41,27,We shall certainly give the disbelievers a taste of severe punishment. We shall repay them according to their worst deeds
  41,28,"that is the reward of the enemies of God- the Fire will be their lasting home, a payment for their rejection of Our revelations"
  41,29,"The disbelievers will say, ‘Our Lord, show us those jinn and men who misled us and we shall trample them underfoot, so that they may be among the lowest of the low.’"
