quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  8,70,"Prophet, tell those you have taken captive, ‘If God knows of any good in your hearts, He will give you something better than what has been taken from you, and He will forgive you: God is forgiving and merciful.’"
  8,71,"But if they mean to betray you, they have betrayed God before, and He has given you mastery over them: He is all knowing, all wise"
  8,72,"Those who believed and emigrated [to Medina] and struggled for God’s cause with their possessions and persons, and those who gave refuge and help, are all allies of one another. As for those who believed but did not emigrate, you are not responsible for their protection until they have done so. But if they seek help from you against persecution, it is your duty to assist them, except against people with whom you have a treaty: God sees all that you do"
  8,73,"The disbelievers support one another. If you do not do the same, there will be persecution in the land and great corruption"
  8,74,"Those who believed and emigrated, and struggled for God’s cause, and those who gave refuge and help- they are the true believers and they will have forgiveness and generous provision"
  8,75,"And those who came to believe afterwards, and emigrated and struggled alongside you, they are part of you, but relatives still have prior claim over one another in God’s Scripture: God has full knowledge of all things"
