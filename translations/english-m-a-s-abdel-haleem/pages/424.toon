quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  33,44,when they meet Him they will be greeted with ‘Peace’- and He has prepared a generous reward for them
  33,45,"Prophet, We have sent you as a witness, as a bearer of good news and warning"
  33,46,"as one who calls people to God by His leave, as a light-giving lamp"
  33,47,Give the believers the good news that great bounty awaits them from God
  33,48,"Do not give in to the disbelievers and the hypocrites: ignore the harm they cause you and put your trust in God. God is enough to trust"
  33,49,"Believers, you have no right to expect a waiting period when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them: make provision for them and release them in an honourable way"
  33,50,"Prophet, We have made lawful for you the wives whose bride gift you have paid, and any slaves God has assigned to you through war, and the daughters of your uncles and aunts on your father’s and mother’s sides, who migrated with you. Also any believing woman who has offered herself to the Prophet and whom the Prophet wishes to wed- this is only for you [Prophet] and not the rest of the believers: We know exactly what We have made obligatory for them concerning their wives and slave-girls- so you should not be blamed: God is most forgiving, most merciful"
