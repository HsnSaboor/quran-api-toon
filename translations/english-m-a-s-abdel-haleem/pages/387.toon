  28,15,"He entered the city, unnoticed by its people, and found two men fighting: one from his own people, the other an enemy.

  28,16,"He said, ‘Lord, I have wronged myself. Forgive me,’ so He forgave him; He is truly the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful"
  28,17,"He said, ‘My Lord, because of the blessings You have bestowed upon me, I shall never support those who do evil.’"
  28,18,"Next morning, he was walking in the city, fearful and vigilant, when suddenly the man he had helped the day before cried out to him for help. Moses said, ‘You are clearly a troublemaker.’"
  28,19,"As he was about to attack the man who was an enemy to both of them, the man said, ‘Moses, are you going to kill me as you killed that person yesterday? You clearly want to be a tyrant in the land; you do not intend to put things right.’"
  28,20,"Then a man came running from the furthest part of the city and said, ‘Moses, the authorities are talking about killing you, so leave- this is my sincere advice.’"
  28,21,"So Moses left the city, fearful and wary, and prayed, ‘My Lord, save me from people who do wrong.’"
