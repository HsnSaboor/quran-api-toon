quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun is shrouded in darkness
  81,2,when the stars are dimmed
  81,3,when the mountains are set in motion
  81,4,when pregnant camels are abandoned
  81,5,when wild beasts are herded together
  81,6,when the seas boil over
  81,7,when souls are sorted into classes
  81,8,when the baby girl buried alive is asked
  81,9,for what sin she was killed
  81,10,when the records of deeds are spread open
  81,11,when the sky is stripped away
  81,12,when Hell is made to blaze
  81,13,and Paradise brought near
  81,14,then every soul will know what it has brought about
  81,15,I swear by the planets
  81,16,"that recede, move, and hide"
  81,17,by the night that descends
  81,18,by the dawn that softly breathes
  81,19,this is the speech of a noble messenger
  81,20,who possesses great strength and is held in honour by the Lord of the Throne––
  81,21,he is obeyed there and worthy of trust
  81,22,Your companion is not mad
  81,23,he did see him on the clear horizon
  81,24,He does not withhold what is revealed to him from beyond
  81,25,This is not the word of an outcast devil
  81,26,"So where are you [people] going"
  81,27,This is a message for all people
  81,28,for those who wish to take the straight path
  81,29,"But you will only wish to do so by the will of God, the Lord of all people"
