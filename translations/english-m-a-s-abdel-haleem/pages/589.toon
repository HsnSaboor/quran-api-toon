quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  83,35,"as they sit on couches, gazing around"
  83,36,"Have the disbelievers [not] been repaid for their deeds"
  84,1,When the sky is ripped apart
  84,2,obeying its Lord as it rightly must
  84,3,when the earth is levelled out
  84,4,"casts out its contents, and becomes empty"
  84,5,obeying its Lord as it rightly must
  84,6,"you humans, toiling laboriously towards your Lord, will meet Him"
  84,7,whoever is given his record in his right hand
  84,8,will have an easy reckoning
  84,9,and return to his people well pleased
  84,10,but whoever is given his record from behind his back
  84,11,will cry out for destruction––
  84,12,he will burn in the blazing Fire
  84,13,He used to live among his people well pleased
  84,14,"He thought he would never return [to his Lord]––"
  84,15,indeed he will! His Lord was watching him
  84,16,I swear by the glow of sunset
  84,17,by the night and what it covers
  84,18,by the full moon
  84,19,you will progress from stage to stage
  84,20,So why do they not believe
  84,21,"Why, when the Quran is read to them, do they not prostrate themselves [to God]"
  84,22,No! The disbelievers reject the Quran––
  84,23,God knows best what they keep hidden inside––
  84,24,so give them news of a painful torment
  84,25,But those who believe and do good deeds will have a never-ending reward
