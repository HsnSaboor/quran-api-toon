quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  43,11,"who sends water down from the sky in due measure––We resurrect dead land with it, and likewise you will be resurrected from the grave––"
  43,12,"who created every kind of thing, who gave you ships and animals to ride on"
  43,13,"so that you may remember your Lord’s grace when you are seated on them and say, ‘Glory be to Him who has given us control over this; we could not have done it by ourselves"
  43,14,Truly it is to our Lord that we are returning.’
  43,15,Yet they assign some of His own servants to Him as offspring!Man is clearly ungrateful
  43,16,Has He taken daughters for Himself and favoured you with sons
  43,17,"When one of them is given news of the birth of a daughter, such as he so readily ascribes to the Lord of Mercy, his face grows dark and he is filled with gloom"
  43,18,"‘Someone who is brought up amongst trinkets, who cannot put together a clear argument?’"
  43,19,They consider the angels- God’s servants- to be female. Did they witness their creation? Their claim will be put on record and they will be questioned about it
  43,20,"They say, ‘If the Lord of Mercy had willed it, we would not have worshipped them,’ but they do not know that- they are only guessing"
  43,21,"or have We perhaps given them a book before this one, to which they hold fast"
  43,22,"No indeed! They say, ‘We saw our fathers following this tradition; we are guided by their footsteps.’"
