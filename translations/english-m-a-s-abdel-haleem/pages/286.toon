quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  17,39,"[Prophet], this is some of the wisdom your Lord has revealed to you: do not set up another god beside God, or you will be thrown into Hell, blamed and rejected"
  17,40,What? Has your Lord favoured you people with sons and taken daughters for Himself from the angels?What a monstrous thing for you to say
  17,41,"We have explained things in various ways in this Quran, so that such people might take notice, but it has only turned them further away"
  17,42,"Say, ‘If there were other gods along with Him, as they say there are, then they would have tried to find a way to the Lord of the Throne.’"
  17,43,Glory to Him! He is far above what they say
  17,44,"The seven heavens and the earth and everyone in them glorify Him. There is not a single thing that does not celebrate His praise, though you do not understand their praise: He is most forbearing, most forgiving"
  17,45,"[Prophet], when you recite the Quran, We put an invisible barrier between you and those who do not believe in the life to come"
  17,46,"We have put covers on their hearts that prevent them from understanding it, and heaviness in their ears. When you mention your Lord in the Quran, and Him alone, they turn their backs and run away"
  17,47,"We know best the way they listen, when they listen to you and when they confer in secret, and these wrongdoers say, ‘You are only following a man who is bewitched.’"
  17,48,See what they think you are like! But they are lost and cannot find the right way
  17,49,"They also say, ‘What? When we are turned to bones and dust, shall we really be raised up in a new act of creation?’"
