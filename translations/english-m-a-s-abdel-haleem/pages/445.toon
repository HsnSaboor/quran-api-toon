quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  36,71,"Can they not see how, among the things made by Our hands, We have created livestock they control"
  36,72,"and made them obedient, so that some can be used for riding, some for food"
  36,73,"some for other benefits, and some for drink? Will they not give thanks"
  36,74,Yet they have taken other gods besides God to help them
  36,75,though these could not do so even if they called a whole army of them together
  36,76,"So [Prophet] do not be distressed at what they say: We know what they conceal and what they reveal"
  36,77,Can man not see that We created him from a drop of fluid? Yet- lo and behold!- he disputes openly
  36,78,"producing arguments against Us, forgetting his own creation. He says, ‘Who can give life back to bones after they have decayed?’"
  36,79,"Say, ‘He who created them in the first place will give them life again: He has full knowledge of every act of creation"
  36,80,It is He who produces fire for you out of the green tree- lo and behold!- and from this you kindle fire
  36,81,Is He who created the heavens and earth not able to create the likes of these people? Of course He is! He is the All Knowing Creator
  36,82,"when He wills something to be, His way is to say, “Be”- and it is"
  36,83,So glory be to Him in whose Hand lies control over all things. It is to Him that you will all be brought back.’
