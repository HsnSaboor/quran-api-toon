quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,25,“Why do you not support each other now?” ’––
  37,26,no indeed! They will be in complete submission on that Day––
  37,27,and they will turn on one another accusingly
  37,28,"They will say, ‘You came to us from a position of power.’"
  37,29,"They will say, ‘No! It was you who would not believe"
  37,30,we had no power over you- and you were already exceeding all limits
  37,31,Our Lord’s sentence on us is just and we must all taste the punishment
  37,32,We led you astray as we ourselves were astray.’
  37,33,On that Day they will all share the torment
  37,34,this is how We deal with the guilty
  37,35,"Whenever it was said to them, ‘There is no deity but God,’ they became arrogant"
  37,36,"and said, ‘Are we to forsake our gods for a mad poet?’"
  37,37,"‘No: he brought the truth and confirmed the earlier messengers"
  37,38,you will taste the painful torment
  37,39,and be repaid only according to your deeds.’
  37,40,Not so God’s true servants
  37,41,They will have familiar provisions––
  37,42,fruits- and will be honoured
  37,43,in gardens of delight
  37,44,"seated on couches, facing one another"
  37,45,A drink will be passed round among them from a flowing spring
  37,46,"white, delicious to those who taste it"
  37,47,causing no headiness or intoxication
  37,48,With them will be spouses- modest of gaze and beautiful of eye
  37,49,like protected eggs
  37,50,They will turn to one another with questions
  37,51,"one will say, ‘I had a close companion on earth"
