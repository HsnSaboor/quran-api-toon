quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,197,"The pilgrimage takes place during the prescribed months. There should be no indecent speech, misbehaviour, or quarrelling for anyone undertaking the pilgrimage- whatever good you do, God is well aware of it. Provide well for yourselves: the best provision is to be mindful of God- always be mindful of Me, you who have understanding"
  2,198,"but it is no offence to seek some bounty from your Lord. When you surge down from Arafat remember God at the sacred place. Remember Him: He has guided you. Before that you were astray"
  2,199,"Surge down where the rest of the people do, and ask forgiveness of God: He is most forgiving and merciful"
  2,200,"When you have completed your rites, remember God as much as you remember your own fathers, or even more. There are some who pray, ‘Our Lord, give us good in this world,’ and they will have no share in the Hereafter"
  2,201,"others pray, ‘Our Lord, give us good in this world and in the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire.’"
  2,202,"They will have the share they have worked for: God is swift in reckoning"
