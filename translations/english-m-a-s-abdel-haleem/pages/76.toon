quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  3,195,"Their Lord has answered them: ‘I will not allow the deeds of any one of you to be lost, whether you are male or female, each is like the other [in rewards]. I will certainly wipe out the bad deeds of those who emigrated and were driven out of their homes, who suffered harm for My cause, who fought and were killed. I will certainly admit them to Gardens graced with flowing streams, as a reward from God: the best reward is with God.’"
  3,196,"[Prophet], do not be deceived by the disbelievers’ [lucrative] trading to and fro in the land"
  3,197,"this is only a brief enjoyment, after which Hell will be their home- a miserable resting place"
  3,198,But those who were mindful of their Lord will have Gardens graced with flowing streams where they will stay as a reward from God. What God has is best for those who are truly good
  3,199,"Some of the People of the Book believe in God, in what has been sent down to you and in what was sent down to them: humbling themselves before God, they would never sell God’s revelation for a small price. These people will have their rewards with their Lord: God is swift in reckoning"
  3,200,"You who believe, be steadfast, more steadfast than others; be ready; always be mindful of God, so that you may prosper"
