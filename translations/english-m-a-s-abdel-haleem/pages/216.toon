quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,62,"But for those who are on God’s side there is no fear, nor shall they grieve"
  10,63,For those who believe and are conscious of God
  10,64,for them there is good news in this life and in the Hereafter- there is no changing the promises of God- that is truly the supreme triumph
  10,65,"Do not let their words grieve you [Prophet]. Power belongs entirely to God; He hears all and knows all"
  10,66,"indeed, all who are in the heavens and on the earth belong to Him. Those who call upon others beside God are not really following partner-gods; they are only following assumptions and telling lies"
  10,67,It is He who made the night so that you can rest in it and the daylight so that you can see- there truly are signs in this for those who hear
  10,68,"They say, ‘God has children!’ May He be exalted! He is the Self-Sufficient One; everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. You have no authority to say this. How dare you say things about God without any knowledge"
  10,69,"Say [Prophet], ‘Those who invent lies about God will not prosper.’"
  10,70,"They may have a little enjoyment in this world, but then they will return to Us. Then We shall make them taste severe punishment for persisting in blasphemy"
