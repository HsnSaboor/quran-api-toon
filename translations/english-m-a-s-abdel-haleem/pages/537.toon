quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,that this is truly a noble Quran
  56,78,in a protected Record
  56,79,that only the purified can touch
  56,80,sent down from the Lord of all being
  56,81,How can you scorn this statement
  56,82,"And how, in return for the livelihood you are given, can you deny it"
  56,83,When the soul of a dying man comes up to his throat
  56,84,while you gaze on
  56,85,"We are nearer to him than you, though you do not see Us"
  56,86,"why, if you are not to be judged"
  56,87,"do you not restore his soul to him, if what you say is true"
  56,88,If that dying person is one of those who will be brought near to God
  56,89,"he will have rest, ease, and a Garden of Bliss"
  56,90,if he is one of those on the Right
  56,91,"[he will hear], ‘Peace be on you,’ from his companions on the Right"
  56,92,but if he is one of those who denied the truth and went astray
  56,93,he will be welcomed with scalding water
  56,94,He will burn in Hell
  56,95,This is the certain truth
  56,96,"[Prophet], glorify the name of your Lord the Supreme"
  57,1,"Everything in the heavens and earth glorifies God––He is the Almighty, the Wise"
  57,2,Control of the heavens and earth belongs to Him; He gives life and death; He has power over all things
  57,3,He is the First and the Last; the Outer and the Inner; He has knowledge of all things
