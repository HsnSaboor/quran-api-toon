quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  56,51,and you who have gone astray and denied the truth
  56,52,will eat from the bitter tree of Zaqqum
  56,53,filling your bellies with it
  56,54,and drink scalding water
  56,55,lapping it like thirsty camels.’
  56,56,This will be their welcome on the Day of Judgement
  56,57,"It was We who created you: will you not believe"
  56,58,"Consider [the semen] you eject"
  56,59,do you create it yourselves or are We the Creator
  56,60,We ordained death to be among you. Nothing could stop Us
  56,61,if We intended to change you and recreate you in a way unknown to you
  56,62,"You have learned how you were first created: will you not reflect"
  56,63,Consider the seeds you sow in the ground
  56,64,is it you who make them grow or We
  56,65,"If We wished, We could turn your harvest into chaff and leave you to wail"
  56,66,‘We are burdened with debt
  56,67,we are bereft.’
  56,68,Consider the water you drink
  56,69,was it you who brought it down from the rain-cloud or We
  56,70,"If We wanted, We could make it bitter: will you not be thankful"
  56,71,Consider the fire you kindle
  56,72,is it you who make the wood for it grow or We
  56,73,"We made it a reminder, and useful to those who kindle it"
  56,74,"so [Prophet] glorify the name of your Lord, the Supreme"
  56,75,I swear by the positions of the stars
  56,76,"a mighty oath, if you only knew"
