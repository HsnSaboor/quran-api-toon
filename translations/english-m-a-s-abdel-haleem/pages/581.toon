quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  77,20,Did We not make you from an underrated fluid
  77,21,which We housed in a safe lodging
  77,22,for a determined period
  77,23,"We determine [it]: how excellently We determine"
  77,24,"Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth"
  77,25,Did We not make the earth a home
  77,26,for the living and the dead
  77,27,"Did We not place firm, lofty mountains on it and provide you with sweet water"
  77,28,"Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth"
  77,29,"They will be told, ‘Go to that which you used to deny"
  77,30,Go to a shadow of smoke!’ It rises in three columns
  77,31,"no shade does it give, nor relief from the flame"
  77,32,it shoots out sparks as large as treetrunks
  77,33,and as bright as copper
  77,34,"Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth"
  77,35,On that Day they will be speechless
  77,36,and they will be given no chance to offer any excuses
  77,37,"Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth"
  77,38,"[They will be told], ‘This is the Day of Decision: We have gathered you and earlier generations"
  77,39,"If you have any plots against Me, try them now.’"
  77,40,"Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth"
  77,41,"But those who took heed of God will enjoy cool shade, springs"
  77,42,and any fruit they desire
  77,43,"[they will be told], ‘Eat and drink to your hearts’ content as a reward for your deeds"
  77,44,this is how We reward those who do good.’
  77,45,"Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth"
  77,46,"[You may] eat and enjoy yourselves for a short while, evildoers that you are"
  77,47,"Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth"
  77,48,"When they are told, ‘Bow down in prayer,’ they do not do so"
  77,49,"Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth"
  77,50,"In what revelation, after this, will they believe"
