quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  10,34,"Ask them, ‘Can any of your partner-gods originate creation, then bring it back to life again in the end?’ Say, ‘It is God that originates creation, and then brings it back to life, so how can you be misled?’"
  10,35,"Say, ‘Can any of your partner-gods show the way to the Truth?’ Say, ‘God shows the way to the Truth. Is someone who shows the way to the Truth more worthy to be followed, or someone who cannot find the way unless he himself is shown? What is the matter with you? How do you judge?’"
  10,36,"Most of them follow nothing but assumptions, but assumptions can be of no value at all against the Truth: God is well aware of what they do"
  10,37,Nor could this Quran have been devised by anyone other than God. It is a confirmation of what was revealed before it and an explanation of the Scripture- let there be no doubt about it- it is from the Lord of the Worlds
  10,38,"Or do they say, ‘He has devised it’? Say, ‘Then produce a sura like it, and call on anyone you can beside God if you are telling the truth.’"
  10,39,"But they are denying what they cannot comprehend- its prophecy has yet to be fulfilled for them. In the same way, those before them refused to believe- see what was the end of those evildoers"
  10,40,"Some of them believe in it, and some do not: your Lord knows best those who cause corruption"
  10,41,"If they do not believe you, [Prophet], say, ‘I act for myself, and you for yourselves. You are not responsible for my actions nor am I responsible for yours.’"
  10,42,"Some of them do listen to you: but can you make the deaf hear if they will not use their minds"
