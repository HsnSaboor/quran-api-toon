  42,23,"it is of this that God gives good news to His servants who believe and do good deeds. Say [Prophet], ‘I ask no reward from you for this, only the affection due to kin.’ If anyone does good, We shall increase it for him; God is most forgiving and most appreciative"

  42,29,"Among His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and all the living creatures He has scattered throughout them: He has the power to gather them all together whenever He will"
  42,30,"Whatever misfortune befalls you [people], it is because of what your own hands have done- God forgives much"
  42,31,"you cannot escape Him anywhere on earth: you have no protector or helper other than God"
