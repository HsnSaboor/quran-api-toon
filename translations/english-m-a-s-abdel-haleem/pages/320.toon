quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  20,114,"exalted be God, the one who is truly in control. [Prophet], do not rush to recite before the revelation is fully complete but say, ‘Lord, increase me in knowledge!’"
  20,115,"We also commanded Adam before you, but he forgot and We found him lacking in constancy"
  20,116,"When We said to the angels, ‘Bow down before Adam,’ they did. But Iblis refused"
  20,117,"so We said, ‘Adam, this is your enemy, yours and your wife’s: do not let him drive you out of the garden and make you miserable"
  20,118,"In the garden you will never go hungry, feel naked"
  20,119,"be thirsty, or suffer the heat of the sun.’"
  20,120,"But Satan whispered to Adam, saying, ‘Adam, shall I show you the tree of immortality and power that never decays?’"
  20,121,and they both ate from it. They became conscious of their nakedness and began to cover themselves with leaves from the garden. Adam disobeyed his Lord and was led astray
  20,122,"later his Lord brought him close, accepted his repentance, and guided him"
  20,123,"God said, ‘Get out of the garden as each other’s enemy.’ Whoever follows My guidance, when it comes to you [people], will not go astray nor fall into misery"
  20,124,but whoever turns away from it will have a life of great hardship. We shall bring him blind to the Assembly on the Day of Resurrection
  20,125,"and he will say, ‘Lord, why did You bring me here blind? I was sighted before!’"
