quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  22,47,"They will challenge you [Prophet] to hasten the punishment. God will not fail in His promise- a Day with your Lord is like a thousand years by your reckoning"
  22,48,"To many a town steeped in wrongdoing I gave more time and then struck them down: they all return to Me in the end"
  22,49,"Say [Prophet], ‘People, I am sent only to give you clear warning.’"
  22,50,Those who believe and do good deeds will be forgiven and have a generous reward
  22,51,but those who strive to oppose Our messages and try in vain to defeat Us are destined for the Blaze
  22,52,"We have never sent any messenger or prophet before you [Muhammad] into whose wishes Satan did not insinuate something, but God removes what Satan insinuates and then God affirms His message. God is all knowing and wise"
  22,53,"He makes Satan’s insinuations a temptation only for the sick at heart and those whose hearts are hardened- the evildoers are profoundly opposed [to the Truth]"
  22,54,"and He causes those given knowledge to realize that this Revelation is your Lord’s Truth, so that they may believe in it and humble their hearts to Him: God guides the faithful to the straight path"
  22,55,The disbelievers will remain in doubt about it until the Hour suddenly overpowers them or until torment descends on them on a Day devoid of all hope
