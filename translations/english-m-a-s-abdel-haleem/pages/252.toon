quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  13,19,Can someone who knows that the revelation from your Lord is the Truth be equal to someone who is blind? Only those with understanding will take it to heart
  13,20,those who fulfil the agreements they make in God’s name and do not break their pledges
  13,21,who join together what God commands to be joined; who are in awe of their Lord and fear the harshness of the Reckoning
  13,22,"who remain steadfast through their desire for the face of their Lord; who keep up the prayer; who give secretly and openly from what We have provided for them; who repel evil with good. These will have the reward of the [true] home"
  13,23,"they will enter perpetual Gardens, along with their righteous ancestors, spouses, and descendants; the angels will go in to them from every gate"
  13,24,"‘Peace be with you, because you have remained steadfast. What an excellent reward is this home of yours!’"
  13,25,"But there will be rejection for those who break their confirmed agreements made in God’s name, who break apart what God has commanded to be joined and who spread corruption on earth: theirs is the dreadful home"
  13,26,"God gives abundantly to whoever He will, and sparingly to whoever He will- and though they may revel in the life of this world, it is but a fleeting comfort compared with the Life to come"
  13,27,"The disbelievers say, ‘Why has no miracle been sent down to him from his Lord?’ [Prophet], say, ‘God leaves whoever He will to stray, and guides to Himself those who turn towards Him"
  13,28,those who have faith and whose hearts find peace in the remembrance of God- truly it is in the remembrance of God that hearts find peace
