quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  37,127,but they rejected him. They will be brought to punishment as a consequence
  37,128,not so the true servants of God
  37,129,We let him be praised by succeeding generations
  37,130,‘Peace be to Elijah!’
  37,131,This is how We reward those who do good
  37,132,truly he was one of Our faithful servants
  37,133,Lot was also one of the messengers
  37,134,We saved him and all his family
  37,135,except for an old woman who stayed behind
  37,136,and We destroyed the rest
  37,137,"You [people] pass by their ruins morning"
  37,138,"and night: will you not take heed"
  37,139,Jonah too was one of the messengers
  37,140,He fled to the overloaded ship
  37,141,"They cast lots, he suffered defeat"
  37,142,"and a great fish swallowed him, for he had committed blameworthy acts"
  37,143,If he had not been one of those who glorified God
  37,144,he would have stayed in its belly until the Day when all are raised up
  37,145,"but We cast him out, sick, on to a barren shore"
  37,146,and made a gourd tree grow above him
  37,147,We sent him to a hundred thousand people or more
  37,148,"They believed, so We let them live out their lives"
  37,149,"Now [Muhammad], ask the disbelievers: is it true that your Lord has daughters, while they choose sons for themselves"
  37,150,Did We create the angels as females while they were watching
  37,151,No indeed! It is one of their lies when they say
  37,152,‘God has begotten.’ How they lie
  37,153,Did He truly choose daughters in preference to sons
