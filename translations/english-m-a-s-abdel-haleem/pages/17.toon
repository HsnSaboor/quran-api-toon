  2,106,"Any revelation We cause to be superseded or forgotten, We replace with something better or similar. Do you [Prophet] not know that God has power over everything"
  2,107,"Do you not know that control of the heavens and the earth belongs to Him? You [believers] have no protector or helper but God"
  2,108,Do you wish to demand of your messenger something similar to what was demanded of Moses? Whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has strayed far from the right path
  2,109,"Even after the truth has become clear to them, many of the People of the Book wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of their selfish envy. Forgive and forbear until God gives his command: He has power over all things"
  2,110,"Keep up the prayer and pay the prescribed alms. Whatever good you store up for yourselves, you will find it with God: He sees everything you do"
  2,111,"They also say, ‘No one will enter Paradise unless he is a Jew or a Christian.’ This is their own wishful thinking. [Prophet], say, ‘Produce your evidence, if you are telling the truth.’"
  2,112,"In fact, any who direct themselves wholly to God and do good will have their reward with their Lord: no fear for them, nor will they grieve"
