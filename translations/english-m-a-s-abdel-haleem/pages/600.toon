  101,1,The Crashing Blow

  101,5,and the mountains like tufts of wool
  101,6,the one whose good deeds are heavy on the scales
  101,7,will have a pleasant life
  101,8,but the one whose good deeds are light
  101,9,will have the Bottomless Pit for his home––

  102,2,until you go into your graves
  102,3,No indeed! You will come to know
  102,4,No indeed! In the end you will come to know
  102,5,No indeed! If only you knew for certain
  102,6,You will most definitely see Hellfire
  102,7,you will see it with the eye of certainty
  102,8,"On that Day, you will be asked about your pleasures"
