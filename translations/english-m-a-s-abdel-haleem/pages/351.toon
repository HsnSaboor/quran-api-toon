  24,11,"It was a group from among you that concocted the lie––do not consider it a bad thing for you [people]; it was a good thing––and every one of them will be charged with the sin he has earned. He who took the greatest part in it will have a painful punishment"

  24,13,"And why did the accusers not bring four witnesses to it? If they cannot produce such witnesses, they are the liars in God’s eyes"
  24,14,"If it were not for God’s bounty and mercy towards you in this world and the next, you would already have been afflicted by terrible suffering for indulging in such talk"
  24,15,"When you took it up with your tongues, and spoke with your mouths things you did not know [to be true], you thought it was trivial but to God it was very serious"
  24,16,"When you heard the lie, why did you not say, ‘We should not repeat this- God forbid!- It is a monstrous slander’"
  24,17,"God warns you never to do anything like this again, if you are true believers"
  24,18,"God makes His messages clear to you: God is all knowing, all wise"
  24,19,"A painful punishment waits in this world and the next for those who like indecency to spread among the believers: God knows and you do not"
