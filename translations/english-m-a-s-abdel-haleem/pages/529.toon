quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  54,7,"eyes downcast, they will come out of their graves like swarming locusts"
  54,8,"rushing towards the Summoner. The disbelievers will cry, ‘This is a stern day!’"
  54,9,"The people of Noah rejected the truth before them: they rejected Our servant, saying, ‘He is mad!’ Noah was rebuked"
  54,10,"and so he called upon his Lord, ‘I am defeated: help me!’"
  54,11,So We opened the gates of the sky with torrential water
  54,12,"burst the earth with gushing springs: the waters met for a preordained purpose"
  54,13,We carried him along on a vessel of planks and nails
  54,14,"that floated under Our watchful eye, a reward for the one who had been rejected"
  54,15,"We have left this as a sign: will anyone take heed"
  54,16,"How [terrible] was My punishment and [the fulfilment of] My warnings"
  54,17,"We have made it easy to learn lessons from the Quran: will anyone take heed"
  54,18,"The people of 'Ad also rejected the truth. How [terrible] was My punishment and [the fulfilment of] My warnings"
  54,19,We released a howling wind against them on a day of terrible disaster
  54,20,it swept people away like uprooted palm trunks
  54,21,"How [terrible] was My punishment and [the fulfilment of] My warnings"
  54,22,"We have made it easy to learn lessons from the Quran: will anyone take heed"
  54,23,The people of Thamud also rejected the warnings
  54,24,"they said, ‘What? A man? Why should we follow a lone man from amongst ourselves? That would be misguided; quite insane"
  54,25,"Would a mes-sage be given to him alone out of all of us? No, he is an insolent liar!’"
  54,26,‘Tomorrow they will know who is the insolent liar
  54,27,"for We shall send them a she-camel to test them: so watch them [Salih] and be patient"
