quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,73,"Prophet, strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be tough with them. Hell is their final home- an evil destin-ation"
  9,74,"They swear by God that they did not, but they certainly did speak words of defiance and became defiant after having submitted; they tried to do something, though they did not achieve it, ––being spiteful was their only response to God and His Messenger enriching them out of His bounty. They would be better off turning back [to God]: if they turn away, God will punish them in this world and the Hereafter, and there will be no one on earth to protect or help them"
  9,75,"There are some among them who pledged themselves to God, saying, ‘If God gives us some of His bounty, we shall certainly give alms and be righteous,’"
  9,76,"yet when He did give them some of His bounty, they became mean and turned obstinately away"
  9,77,"Because they broke their promise to God, because of all the lies they told, He made hypocrisy settle in their hearts until the Day they meet Him"
  9,78,Do they not realize that God knows their secrets and their private discussions? That God knows all that is hidden
  9,79,"It is they who criticize the believers who give freely and those who can only give a little with great effort: they scoff at such people, but it is God who scoffs at them- a painful punishment awaits them"
