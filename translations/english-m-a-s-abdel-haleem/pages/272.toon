quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  16,43,"[Prophet], all the messengers We sent before you were simply men to whom We had given the Revelation: you [people] can ask those who have knowledge if you do not know"
  16,44,"We sent them with clear signs and scriptures. We have sent down the message to you too [Prophet], so that you can explain to people what was sent for them, so that they may reflect"
  16,45,"Are those who plan evil so sure that God will not make the earth swallow them up, that punishment will not come on them from some unimagined direction"
  16,46,that it will not catch them suddenly in the midst of their comings and goings- for they cannot frustrate God
  16,47,or that it will not catch up with them gradually? Indeed your Lord is kind and merciful
  16,48,"Do the [disbelievers] not observe the things that God has created, casting their shadows right and left, submitting themselves to God obediently"
  16,49,"It is to God that everything in the heavens and earth submits, every beast that moves, even the angels- they are free from arrogance"
  16,50,"they fear their Lord above them, and they do as they are commanded"
  16,51,"God said, ‘Do not take two gods’- for He is the One God––‘ I alone am the One that you should hold in awe.’"
  16,52,"Everything in the heavens and earth belongs to Him: everlasting obedience is His right. Will you heed anyone other than God"
  16,53,"Whatever good things you possess come from God, and when hardship afflicts you, it is to Him alone you cry out for help"
  16,54,yet when He has relieved you of your hardship- lo and behold!- some of you attribute partners to your Lord
