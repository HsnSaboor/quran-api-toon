quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,even when they are within sight of one another. The guilty person will wish he could save himself from the suffering of that Day by sacrificing his sons
  70,12,"his spouse, his brother"
  70,13,the kinsfolk who gave him shelter
  70,14,"and everyone on earth, if it could save him"
  70,15,But no! There is a raging flame
  70,16,that strips away the skin
  70,17,"and it will claim everyone who rejects the truth, turns away"

  70,21,but tight-fisted when good fortune comes his way
  70,22,Not so those who pray
  70,23,and are constant in their prayers

  70,34,and are steadfast in their prayers
  70,35,They will be honoured in Gardens of bliss
  70,36,"What is wrong with the disbelievers? Why do they rush to peer at you [Prophet]"
  70,37,"from right and left, in crowds"
  70,38,Does every one of them expect to enter a Garden of bliss
  70,39,No! We created them from the substance they know
