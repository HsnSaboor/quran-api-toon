quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,What are they asking about
  78,2,The momentous announcement
  78,3,about which they differ
  78,4,They will find out
  78,5,In the end they will find out
  78,6,Did We not make the earth smooth
  78,7,and make the mountains to keep it stable
  78,8,Did We not create you in pairs
  78,9,give you sleep for rest
  78,10,the night as a cover
  78,11,and the day for your livelihood
  78,12,"Did We not build seven strong [heavens] above you"
  78,13,and make a blazing lamp
  78,14,Did We not send water pouring down from the clouds
  78,15,"to bring forth with it grain, plants"
  78,16,and luxuriant gardens
  78,17,A time has been appointed for the Day of Decision
  78,18,a Day when the Trumpet will sound and you will come forward in crowds
  78,19,when the sky will open up like wide portals
  78,20,when the mountains will vanish like a mirage
  78,21,Hell lies in wait
  78,22,a home for oppressors
  78,23,"to stay in for a long, long time"
  78,24,where they will taste no coolness nor drink
  78,25,except one that is scalding and dark––
  78,26,a fitting requital
  78,27,for they did not fear a reckoning
  78,28,and they rejected Our messages as lies
  78,29,We have recorded everything in a Record
  78,30,"‘Taste this: all you will get from Us is more torment.’"
