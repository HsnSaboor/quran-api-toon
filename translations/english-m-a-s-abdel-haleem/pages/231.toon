quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,82,"And so when what We had ordained came about, We turned their town upside down and rained down stones of baked clay on it, layer upon layer"
  11,83,marked from your Lord. It is not far from the evildoers
  11,84,"And to Midian, We sent their brother Shuayb. He said, ‘My people, worship God. You have no god other than Him. Do not give short measure nor short weight. I see you are prospering, but I fear you will have torment on an overwhelming Day"
  11,85,"My people, in fairness, give full measure and weight. Do not withhold from people things that are rightly theirs, and do not spread corruption in the land"
  11,86,"What lasts with God is best for you, if you are believers: I am not your keeper.’"
  11,87,"They said, ‘Shuayb, does your prayer tell you that we should abandon what our forefathers worshipped and refrain from doing whatever we please with our own property? Indeed you are a tolerant and sensible man.’"
  11,88,"He answered, ‘My people, can you not see? What if I am acting on clear evidence from my Lord? He Himself has given me good provision: I do not want to do what I am forbidding you to do, I only want to put things right as far as I can. I cannot succeed without God’s help: I trust in Him, and always turn to Him"
