quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  78,31,For those who were aware of God there is supreme fulfilment
  78,32,"private gardens, vineyards"
  78,33,"nubile, well-matched companions"
  78,34,and an overflowing cup
  78,35,There they will hear no vain or lying talk
  78,36,"a reward from your Lord, a fitting gift"
  78,37,"from the Lord of the heavens and earth and everything between, the Lord of Mercy. They will have no authority from Him to speak"
  78,38,"On the Day when the Spirit and the angels stand in rows, they will not speak except for those to whom the Lord of Mercy gives permission, who will say only what is right"
  78,39,That is the Day of Truth. So whoever wishes to do so should take the path that leads to his Lord
  78,40,"We have warned you of imminent torment, on the Day when every person will see what their own hands have sent ahead for them, when the disbeliever will say, ‘If only I were dust!’"
  79,1,By the forceful chargers
  79,2,raring to go
  79,3,sweeping ahead at full stretch
  79,4,overtaking swiftly
  79,5,to bring the matter to an end
  79,6,on the Day when the blast reverberates
  79,7,and the second blast follows
  79,8,hearts will tremble
  79,9,and eyes will be downcast
  79,10,"They say, ‘What? shall we be brought back to life"
  79,11,after we have turned into decayed bones?’ and they say
  79,12,‘Such a return is impossible!’
  79,13,But all it will take is a single blast
  79,14,and they will be back above ground
  79,15,"Have you [Prophet] heard the story of Moses"
