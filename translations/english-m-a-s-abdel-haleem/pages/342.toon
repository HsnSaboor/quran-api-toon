quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,"[How] prosperous are the believers"
  23,2,Those who pray humbly
  23,3,who shun idle talk
  23,4,who pay the prescribed alms
  23,5,who guard their chastity
  23,6,except with their spouses or their slaves––with these they are not to blame
  23,7,but anyone who seeks more than this is exceeding the limits––
  23,8,who are faithful to their trusts and pledges
  23,9,and who keep up their prayers
  23,10,will rightly be given
  23,11,"Paradise as their own, there to remain"
  23,12,We created man from an essence of clay
  23,13,then We placed him as a drop of fluid in a safe place
  23,14,"then We made that drop into a clinging form, and We made that form into a lump of flesh, and We made that lump into bones, and We clothed those bones with flesh, and later We made him into other forms––glory be to God, the best of creators!––"
  23,15,then you will die
  23,16,"and then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will be raised up again"
  23,17,"We created seven levels above you: We are never unmindful of Our creation"
