quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,203,"Remember God on the appointed days. If anyone is in a hurry to leave after two days, there is no blame on him, nor is there any blame on anyone who stays on, so long as they are mindful of God. Be mindful of God, and remember that you will be gathered to Him"
  2,204,"There is [a kind of] man whose views on the life of this world may please you [Prophet], he even calls on God to witness what is in his heart, yet he is the bitterest of opponents"
  2,205,"When he leaves, he sets out to spread corruption in the land, destroying crops and live-stock- God does not like corruption"
  2,206,"When he is told, ‘Beware of God,’ his arrogance leads him to sin. Hell is enough for him: a dreadful resting place"
  2,207,"But there is also a kind of man who gives his life away to please God, and God is most compassionate to His servants"
  2,208,"You who believe, enter wholeheartedly into submission to God and do not follow in Satan’s footsteps, for he is your sworn enemy"
  2,209,"If you slip back after clear proof has come to you, then be aware that God is almighty and wise"
  2,210,"Are these people waiting for God to come to them in the shadows of the clouds, together with the angels? But the matter would already have been decided by then: all matters are brought back to God"
