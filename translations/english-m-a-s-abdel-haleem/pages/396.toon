quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  28,85,"He who has made the Quran binding on you [Prophet] will bring you back home. So say, ‘My Lord knows best who has brought true guidance and who is blatantly astray.’"
  28,86,You yourself could not have expected the Scripture to be sent to you; it came only as a mercy from your Lord. So give no help to the disbelievers
  28,87,Do not let them turn you away from God’s revelations after they have been revealed to you. Call people to your Lord. Never become one of those who ascribe partners to God
  28,88,"Do not call out to any other god beside God, for there is no god but Him. Everything will perish except His Face. His is the Judgement and to Him you shall all be brought back"

  29,2,Do people think they will be left alone after saying ‘We believe’ without being put to the test
  29,3,"We tested those who went before them: God will certainly mark out which ones are truthful and which are lying"
  29,4,Do the evildoers think they can escape us? How ill they judge
  29,5,"But as for those who strive for their meeting with God, God’s appointed time is bound to come; He is the All Seeing, the All Knowing"
  29,6,Those who exert themselves do so for their own benefit––God does not need His creatures––
