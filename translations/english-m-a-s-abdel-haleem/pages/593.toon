quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,By the Daybreak
  89,2,by the Ten Nights
  89,3,by the even and the odd
  89,4,by the passing night––
  89,5,is this oath strong enough for a rational person
  89,6,"Have you [Prophet] considered how your Lord dealt with [the people] of 'Ad"
  89,7,"of Iram, [the city] of lofty pillars"
  89,8,whose like has never been made in any land
  89,9,"and the Thamud, who hewed into the rocks in the valley"
  89,10,and the mighty and powerful Pharaoh
  89,11,All of them committed excesses in their lands
  89,12,and spread corruption there
  89,13,your Lord let a scourge of punishment loose on them
  89,14,Your Lord is always watchful
  89,15,"[The nature of] man is that, when his Lord tries him through honour and blessings, he says, ‘My Lord has honoured me,’"
  89,16,"but when He tries him through the restriction of his provision, he says, ‘My Lord has humiliated me.’"
  89,17,"No indeed! You [people] do not honour orphans"
  89,18,you do not urge one another to feed the poor
  89,19,you consume inheritance greedily
  89,20,and you love wealth with a passion
  89,21,"No indeed! When the earth is pounded to dust, pounded and pounded"
  89,22,"when your Lord comes with the angels, rank upon rank"
  89,23,"when Hell is that Day brought near- on that Day man will take heed, but what good will that be to him then"
