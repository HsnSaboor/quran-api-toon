quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,106,"Ask God for forgiveness: He is most forgiving and merciful"
  4,107,"Do not argue for those who betray their own souls: God does not love anyone given to treachery and sin"
  4,108,"They try to hide themselves from people, but they cannot hide from God. He is with them when they plot at night, saying things that do not please Him: He is fully aware of everything they do"
  4,109,"There you [believers] are, arguing on their behalf in this life, but who will argue on their behalf with God on the Day of Resurrection? Who will be their defender"
  4,110,Yet anyone who does evil or wrongs his own soul and then asks God for forgiveness will find Him most forgiving and merciful
  4,111,He who commits sin does so against his own soul- God is all knowing and wise
  4,112,"and anyone who commits an offence or a sin, and then throws the blame on to some innocent person, has burdened himself with deceit as well as flagrant sin"
  4,113,"If it were not for the grace of God and His mercy to you [Prophet], a party of them would have tried to lead you astray; they only lead themselves astray, and cannot harm you in any way, since God has sent down the Scripture and Wisdom to you, and taught you what you did not know. God’s bounty to you is great indeed"
