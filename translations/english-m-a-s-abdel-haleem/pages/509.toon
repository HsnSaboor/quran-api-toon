quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"Those who believe ask why no sura [about fighting] has been sent down. Yet when a decisive sura [that mentions fighting] is sent down, you can see the sick at heart looking at you [Prophet] and visibly fainting at the prospect of death- better for them"

  47,22,"‘If you turn away now, could it be that you will go on to spread corruption all over the land and break your ties of kinship?’"
  47,23,"These are the ones God has rejected, making their ears deaf and their eyes blind"
  47,24,Will they not contemplate the Quran? Do they have locks on their hearts
  47,25,Those who turn on their heels after being shown guidance are duped and tempted by Satan
  47,26,"they say to those who hate what God has sent down, ‘We will obey you in some matters’––God knows their secret schemes"
  47,27,How will they feel when the angels take them in death and beat their faces and their backs
  47,28,"because they practised things that incurred God’s wrath, and disdained to please Him? He makes their deeds go to waste"
  47,29,Do the corrupt at heart assume that God will not expose their malice
