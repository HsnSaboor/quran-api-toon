quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  71,11,He will send down abundant rain from the sky for you
  71,12,He will give you wealth and sons; He will provide you with gardens and rivers
  71,13,What is the matter with you? Why will you not fear God’s majesty
  71,14,when He has created you stage by stage
  71,15,"Have you ever wondered how God created seven heavens, one above the other"
  71,16,placed the moon as a light in them and the sun as a lamp
  71,17,how God made you spring forth from the earth like a plant
  71,18,how He will return you into it and then bring you out again
  71,19,and how He has spread the Earth out for you
  71,20,to walk along its spacious paths?” ’
  71,21,"Noah said, ‘My Lord, they have disobeyed me and followed those whose riches and children only increase their ruin"
  71,22,who have made a grand plan
  71,23,"saying, “Do not renounce your gods"
  71,24,"Do not renounce Wadd, Suwa, Yaghuth, Yauq, or Nasr!” They have led many astray. Lord, bring nothing but destruction down on the evildoers!’"
  71,25,"They were drowned and sent to Hell for their evildoings: they found no one to help them against God"
  71,26,"And Noah said, ‘Lord, do not leave any of the disbelievers on the earth"
  71,27,if you leave them they will lead Your servants astray and beget only sinners and disbelievers
  71,28,"Lord, forgive me, my parents, and whoever enters my house as a believer. Forgive believing men and women but bring nothing but ruin down on the evildoers!’"
