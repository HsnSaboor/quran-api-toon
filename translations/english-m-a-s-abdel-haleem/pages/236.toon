quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  12,5,"and he replied, ‘My son, tell your brothers nothing of this dream, or they may plot to harm you––Satan is man’s sworn enemy"
  12,6,"This is about how your Lord will choose you, teach you to interpret dreams, and perfect His blessing on you and the House of Jacob, just as He perfected it earlier on your forefathers Abraham and Isaac: your Lord is all knowing and wise.’"
  12,7,There are lessons in the story of Joseph and his brothers for all who seek them
  12,8,"The brothers said [to each other], ‘Although we are many, Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are–– our father is clearly in the wrong.’"
  12,9,"[One of them said], ‘Kill Joseph or banish him to another land, and your father’s attention will be free to turn to you. After that you can be righteous.’"
  12,10,"[Another of them] said, ‘Do not kill Joseph, but, if you must, throw him into the hidden depths of a well where some caravan may pick him up.’"
  12,11,"They said to their father, ‘Why do you not trust us with Joseph? We wish him well"
  12,12,Send him with us tomorrow and he will enjoy himself and play- we will take good care of him.’
  12,13,"He replied, ‘The thought of you taking him away with you worries me: I am afraid a wolf may eat him when you are not paying attention.’"
  12,14,"They said, ‘If a wolf were to eat him when there are so many of us, we would truly be losers!’"
