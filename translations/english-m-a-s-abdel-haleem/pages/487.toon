quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  42,32,"Among His signs are the ships, sailing like floating mountains"
  42,33,"if He willed, He could bring the wind to a standstill and they would lie motionless on the surface of the sea- there truly are signs in this for anyone who is steadfast and thankful"
  42,34,or He could cause them to be wrecked on account of what their passengers have done- God pardons much
  42,35,to let those who argue about Our messages know that there is no escape for them
  42,36,What you have been given is only the fleeting enjoyment of this world. Far better and more lasting is what God will give to those who believe and trust in their Lord
  42,37,who shun great sins and gross indecencies; who forgive when they are angry
  42,38,respond to their Lord; keep up the prayer; conduct their affairs by mutual consultation; give to others out of what We have provided for them
  42,39,and defend themselves when they are oppressed
  42,40,"Let harm be requited by an equal harm, though anyone who forgives and puts things right will have his reward from God Himself––He does not like those who do wrong"
  42,41,There is no cause to act against anyone who defends himself after being wronged
  42,42,but there is cause to act against those who oppress people and transgress in the land against all justice- they will have an agonizing torment
  42,43,"though if a person is patient and forgives, this is one of the greatest things"
  42,44,"Anyone God allows to stray will have no one else to protect him: you [Prophet] will see the wrongdoers, when they face the punishment, exclaiming, ‘Is there any way of going back?’"
