quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  14,11,"Their messengers answered, ‘True, we are only men like you, but God favours whichever of His servants He chooses. We cannot bring you any proof unless God permits it, so let the believers put all their trust in Him"
  14,12,"why should we not put our trust in God when it is He who has guided us to this way we follow? We shall certainly bear steadfastly whatever harm you do to us. Let anyone who trusts, trust in God.’"
  14,13,"The disbelievers said to their messengers, ‘We shall expel you from our land unless you return to our religion.’ But their Lord inspired the messengers: ‘We shall destroy the evildoers"
  14,14,"and leave you to dwell in the land after them. This reward is for those who are in awe of meeting Me, and of My warnings.’"
  14,15,"They asked God to decide, and every obstinate tyrant failed"
  14,16,Hell awaits each one; he will be given foul water to drink
  14,17,"which he will try to gulp but scarcely be able to swallow; death will encroach on him from every side, but he will not die; more intense suffering will lie ahead of him"
  14,18,"The deeds of those who reject their Lord are like ashes that the wind blows furiously on a stormy day: they have no power over anything they have gained. This is to stray far, far away"
