quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"There is no good in most of their secret talk, only in commanding charity, or good, or reconciliation between people. To anyone who does these things, seeking to please God, We shall give a rich reward"
  4,115,"if anyone opposes the Messenger, after guidance has been made clear to him, and follows a path other than that of the believers, We shall leave him on his chosen path- We shall burn him in Hell, an evil destination"
  4,116,"God does not forgive the worship of others beside Him- though He does forgive whoever He will for lesser sins- for whoever does this has gone far, far astray"
  4,117,"In His place the idolaters invoke only females, and Satan, the rebel"
  4,118,"God rejected, who said, ‘I will certainly take my due share of Your servants"
  4,119,I will mislead them and incite vain desires in them; I will command them to slit the ears of cattle; I will command them to tamper with God’s creation.’ Whoever chooses Satan as a patron instead of God is utterly ruined
  4,120,"he makes them promises and raises false hopes, but Satan’s promises are nothing but delusion"
  4,121,Such people will have Hell for their home and will find no escape from it
