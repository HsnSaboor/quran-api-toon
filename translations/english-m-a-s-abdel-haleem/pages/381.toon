quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  27,45,"To the people of Thamud We sent their brother, Salih, saying, ‘Worship God alone,’ but they split into two rival factions"
  27,46,"Salih said, ‘My people, why do you rush to bring [forward] what is bad rather than good? Why do you not ask forgiveness of God, so that you may be given mercy?’"
  27,47,"They said, ‘We see you and your fol-lowers as an evil omen.’ He replied, ‘God will decide on any omen you may see: you people are being put to the test.’"
  27,48,There were nine men in the city who spread corruption in the land without making amends
  27,49,"They said, ‘Swear by God: we shall attack this man and his household in the night, then say to his next of kin, “We did not witness the destruction of his household. We are telling the truth.”’"
  27,50,"So they devised their evil plan, but We too made a plan of which they were unaware"
  27,51,"See how their scheming ended: We destroyed them utterly, along with all their people"
  27,52,"As a result of their evil deeds, their homes are desolate ruins- there truly is a sign in this for those who know"
  27,53,but We saved those who believed and were mindful of God
  27,54,"We also sent Lot to his people. He said to them, ‘How can you commit this outrage with your eyes wide open"
  27,55,How can you lust after men instead of women? What fools you are!’
