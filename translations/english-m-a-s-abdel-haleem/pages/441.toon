quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  36,13,Give them the example of the people to whose town messengers came
  36,14,We sent two messengers but they rejected both. Then We reinforced them with a third
  36,15,"They said, ‘Truly, we are messengers to you,’"
  36,16,"but they answered, ‘You are only men like ourselves. The Lord of Mercy has sent nothing; you are just lying.’ They said, ‘Our Lord knows that we have been sent to you"
  36,17,"Our duty is only to deliver the message to you,’"
  36,18,"but they answered, ‘We think you are an evil omen. If you do not stop, we shall stone you, and inflict a painful torment on you.’"
  36,19,"The messengers said, ‘The evil omen is within yourselves. Why do you take it as an evil omen when you are reminded of the Truth? You are going too far!’"
  36,20,"Then, from the furthest part of the city, a man came running. He said, ‘My people, follow the messengers"
  36,21,"Follow them: they are not asking you to reward them and they are rightly guided"
  36,22,Why should I not worship the One who created me? It is to Him that you will be returned
  36,23,"How could I take besides Him any other gods, whose intercession will not help me and who would not be able to save me if the Lord of Mercy wished to harm me"
  36,24,Then I would clearly be in the wrong
  36,25,"I believe in your Lord, so listen to me.’"
  36,26,"He was told, ‘Enter the Garden,’ so he said, ‘If only my people knew"
  36,27,how my Lord has forgiven me and set me among the highly honoured.’
