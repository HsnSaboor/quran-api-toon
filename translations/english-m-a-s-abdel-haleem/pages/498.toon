quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  44,40,The Day of Decision is the time appointed for all
  44,41,a Day when no friend can take another’s place
  44,42,"No one will receive any help except for those to whom God shows mercy: He is the Mighty, the Merciful Lord"
  44,43,The tree of Zaqqum
  44,44,will be food for the sinners
  44,45,"[hot] as molten metal, it boils in their bellies"
  44,46,like seething water
  44,47,‘Take him! Thrust him into the depths of Hell
  44,48,Pour scalding water over his head as punishment!’
  44,49,"‘Taste this, you powerful, respected man"
  44,50,This is what you doubted.’
  44,51,But those mindful of God will be in a safe place
  44,52,amid Gardens and springs
  44,53,"clothed in silk and fine brocade, facing one another"
  44,54,"so it will be. We shall wed them to maidens with large, dark eyes"
  44,55,"Secure and contented, they will call for every kind of fruit"
  44,56,After the one death they will taste death no more. God will guard them from the torment of Hell
  44,57,a bounty from your Lord. That is the supreme triumph
  44,58,"We have made this Quran easy to understand- in your own language [Prophet]- so that they may take heed"
  44,59,So wait; the disbelievers too are waiting
