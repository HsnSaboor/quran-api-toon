quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"They are like people who [labour to] kindle a fire: when it lights up everything around them, God takes away all their light, leaving them in utter darkness, unable to see"
  2,18,"deaf, dumb, and blind: they will never return"
  2,19,"Or [like people who, under] a cloudburst from the sky, with its darkness, thunder, and lightning, put their fingers into their ears to keep out the thunderclaps for fear of death- God surrounds the disbelievers"
  2,20,"The lightning almost snatches away their sight: whenever it crashes on"
  2,21,"People, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, so that you may be mindful [of Him]"
  2,22,"who spread out the earth for you and built the sky; who sent water down from it and with that water produced things for your sustenance. Do not, knowing this, set up rivals to God"
  2,23,"If you have doubts about the revelation We have sent down to Our servant, then produce a single sura like it- enlist whatever supporters you have other than God- if you truly [think you can]"
  2,24,"If you cannot do this- and you never will- then beware of the Fire prepared for the disbelievers, whose fuel is men and stones"
