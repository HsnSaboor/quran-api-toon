quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,By the sun in its morning brightness
  91,2,and by the moon as it follows it
  91,3,by the day as it displays the sun’s glory
  91,4,and by the night as it conceals it
  91,5,by the sky and how He built it
  91,6,and by the earth and how He spread it
  91,7,by the soul and how He formed it
  91,8,"and inspired it [to know] its own rebellion and piety"
  91,9,The one who purifies his soul succeeds
  91,10,and the one who corrupts it fails
  91,11,"In their arrogant cruelty, the people of Thamud called [their messenger] a liar"
  91,12,"when the most wicked man among them rose [against him]"
  91,13,"The messenger of God said to them, ‘[Leave] God’s camel to drink,’"
  91,14,but they called him a liar and hamstrung her. Their Lord destroyed them for their crime and levelled them
  91,15,He did not hesitate to punish them
  92,1,By the enshrouding night
  92,2,by the radiant day
  92,3,by His creation of male and female
  92,4,The ways you take differ greatly
  92,5,"There is the one who gives, who is mindful of God"
  92,6,who testifies to goodness––
  92,7,We shall smooth his way towards ease
  92,8,"There is the one who is miserly, who is self-satisfied"
  92,9,who denies goodness––
  92,10,We shall smooth his way towards hardship
  92,11,and his wealth will not help him as he falls
  92,12,Our part is to provide guidance––
  92,13,this world and the next belong to Us––
  92,14,so I warn you about the raging Fire
