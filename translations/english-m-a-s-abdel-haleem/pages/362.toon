quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  25,21,"Those who do not fear to meet Us say, ‘Why are the angels not sent down to us?’ or ‘Why can we not see our Lord?’ They are too proud of themselves and too insolent"
  25,22,"There will be no good news for the guilty on the Day they see the angels. The angels will say, ‘You cannot cross the forbidden barrier,’"
  25,23,and We shall turn to the deeds they have done and scatter them like dust
  25,24,"But the companions in the Garden will have a better home on that Day, and a fairer place to rest"
  25,25,On the Day when the sky and its clouds are split apart and the angels sent down in streams
  25,26,"on that Day, true authority belongs to the Lord of Mercy. It will be a grievous Day for the disbelievers"
  25,27,"On that Day the evildoer will bite his own hand and say, ‘If only I had taken the same path as the Messenger"
  25,28,Woe is me! If only I had not taken so and so as a friend
  25,29,he led me away from the Revelation after it reached me. Satan has always betrayed mankind.’
  25,30,"The Messenger has said, ‘Lord, my people treat this Quran as something to be shunned,’"
  25,31,"but We have always appointed adversaries from the wicked, for every prophet: Your Lord is sufficient guide and helper"
  25,32,"The disbelievers also say, ‘Why was the Quran not sent down to him all at once?’ We sent it in this way to strengthen your heart [Prophet]; We gave it to you in gradual revelation"
