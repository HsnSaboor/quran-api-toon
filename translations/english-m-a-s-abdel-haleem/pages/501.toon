quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  45,23,"[Prophet], consider the one who has taken his own desire as a god, whom God allows to stray in the face of knowledge, sealing his ears and heart and covering his eyes- who can guide such a person after God [has done this]? Will you [people] not take heed"
  45,24,"They say, ‘There is only our life in this world: we die, we live, nothing but time destroys us.’ They have no knowledge of this; they only follow guesswork. Their only argument"
  45,25,"when Our clear revelations are recited to them, is to say, ‘Bring back our forefathers if what you say is true.’"
  45,26,"[Prophet], say, ‘It is God who gives you life, then causes you to die, and then He gathers you all to the Day of Resurrection of which there is no doubt, though most people do not comprehend.’"
  45,27,"Control of everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to God. When the Hour comes, those who follow falsehood will be the losers on that Day"
  45,28,"You will see every community kneeling. Every community will be summoned to its record: ‘Today you will be repaid for what you did"
  45,29,"Here is Our record that tells the truth about you: We have been recording everything you do.’"
  45,30,Those who believed and did good deeds will be admitted by their Lord into His mercy- that is the clearest triumph
  45,31,"but those who disbelieved [will be asked]: ‘When My revelations were recited to you, were you not arrogant and persistent in wicked deeds"
  45,32,"When it was said to you, “God’s promise is true: there is no doubt about the Hour,” did you not reply, “We know nothing of the Hour. This is only conjecture in our opinion. We are not convinced”?’"
