quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"[Prophet], your Lord is well aware that you sometimes spend nearly two-thirds of the night at prayer––sometimes half, sometimes a third––as do some of your followers. God determines the division of night and day. He knows that you will not be able to keep a measure of it and He has relented towards all of you, so recite as much of the Quran as is easy for you. He knows that some of you will be sick, some of you travelling through the land seeking God’s bounty, some of you fighting in God’s way: recite as much as is easy for you, keep up the prayer, pay the prescribed alms, and make God a good loan. Whatever good you store up for yourselves will be improved and increased for you. Ask God for His forgiveness, He is most forgiving, most merciful"

  74,3,Proclaim the greatness of your Lord
  74,4,cleanse yourself

  74,8,When the Trumpet sounds
  74,9,that will be a Day of anguish for the disbelievers
  74,10,They will have no ease
  74,11,"[Prophet], leave Me to deal with the one I created helpless"
  74,12,then gave vast wealth
  74,13,and sons by his side
  74,14,making everything easy for him––
  74,15,yet he still hopes I will give him more
  74,16,No! He has been stubbornly hostile to Our revelation
  74,17,I will inflict a spiralling torment on him
