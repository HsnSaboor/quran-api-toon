quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,43,no community can advance or delay its time
  23,44,"and We sent Our messengers in succession: whenever a messenger came to a community they invariably called him a liar, so We destroyed them one after the other and made them into cautionary tales. Away with the disbelievers"
  23,45,"Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron, with Our signs and clear authority"
  23,46,"to Pharaoh and his prominent leaders, but they responded with arrogance: they were a haughty people"
  23,47,"They said, ‘Are we to believe in two mortals like us? And their people are our servants?’"
  23,48,"and so they called them both liars: they became another ruined people"
  23,49,"We gave Moses the Scripture, so that they might be rightly guided"
  23,50,We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign; We gave them shelter on a peaceful hillside with flowing water
  23,51,"Messengers, eat good things and do good deeds: I am well aware of what you do"
  23,52,"This community of yours is one- and I am your Lord: be mindful of Me"
  23,53,"but they have split their community into sects, each rejoicing in their own"
  23,54,"So [Muhammad] leave them for a while steeped [in their ignorance]"
  23,55,"Do they reckon that, by giving them wealth and sons"
  23,56,We race to give them good things? They really have no idea
  23,57,Those who stand in awe of their Lord
  23,58,who believe in His messages
  23,59,who do not ascribe partners to Him
