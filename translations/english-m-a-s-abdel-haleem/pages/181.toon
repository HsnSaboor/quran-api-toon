quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  8,34,"yet why should God not punish them when they debar people from the Sacred Mosque, although they are not its [rightful] guardians? Only those mindful of God are its rightful guardians, but most of the disbelievers do not realize this"
  8,35,Their prayers before the House are nothing but whistling and clapping. ‘So taste the punishment for your disbelief.’
  8,36,"They use their wealth to bar people from the path of God, and they will go on doing so. In the end this will be a source of intense regret for them: they will be overcome and herded towards Hell"
  8,37,"God will separate the bad from the good, place the bad on top of one another- heaping them all up together- and put them in Hell. They will be the losers"
  8,38,"[Prophet], tell the disbelievers that if they desist their past will be forgiven, but if they persist, they have an example in the fate of those who went before"
  8,39,"[Believers], fight them until there is no more persecution, and all worship is devoted to God alone: if they desist, then God sees all that they do"
  8,40,"but if they pay no heed, be sure that God is your protector, the best protector and the best helper"
