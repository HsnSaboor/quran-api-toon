quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,184,"Be mindful of God who created you and former generations,’"
  26,185,"but they replied, ‘You are bewitched"
  26,186,You are nothing but a man like us. In fact we think you are a liar
  26,187,"Make bits of the heavens fall down on us, if you are telling the truth.’"
  26,188,"He said, ‘My Lord knows best what you do.’"
  26,189,"They called him a liar, and so the torment of the Day of Shadow came upon them- it was the torment of a terrible day"
  26,190,"There truly is a sign in this, though most of them will not believe"
  26,191,"your Lord alone is the Almighty, the Merciful"
  26,192,"Truly, this Quran has been sent down by the Lord of the Worlds"
  26,193,the Trustworthy Spirit brought it down
  26,194,"to your heart [Prophet], so that you could bring warning"
  26,195,in a clear Arabic tongue
  26,196,This was foretold in the scriptures of earlier religions
  26,197,Is it not proof enough for them that the learned men of the Children of Israel have recognized it
  26,198,If We had sent it down to someone who was not an Arab
  26,199,"and he had recited it to them, they still would not have believed in it"
  26,200,So We make it pass straight through the hearts of the guilty
  26,201,they will not believe in it until they see the grievous torment
  26,202,which will suddenly hit them when they are not expecting it
  26,203,"and then they will say, ‘Can we have more time?’"
  26,204,How can they ask that Our punishment be brought to them sooner
  26,205,"Think, if we let them enjoy this life for some years"
  26,206,and then the promised torment came upon them
