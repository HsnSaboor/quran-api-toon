quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  89,24,"He will say, ‘Would that I had provided for this life to come!’"
  89,25,"On that Day, no one will punish as He punishes"
  89,26,and no one will bind as He binds
  89,27,"‘[But] you, soul at peace"
  89,28,return to your Lord well pleased and well pleasing
  89,29,go in among My servants
  89,30,and into My Garden.’
  90,1,I swear by this city––
  90,2,"and you [Prophet] are an inhabitant of this city––"
  90,3,"[I swear] by parent and offspring"
  90,4,that We have created man for toil and trial
  90,5,Does he think that no one will have power over him
  90,6,"‘I have squandered great wealth,’ he says"
  90,7,Does he think no one observes him
  90,8,Did We not give him eyes
  90,9,"a tongue, lips"
  90,10,"and point out to him the two clear ways [of good and evil]"
  90,11,Yet he has not attempted the steep path
  90,12,What will explain to you what the steep path is
  90,13,It is to free a slave
  90,14,to feed at a time of hunger
  90,15,an orphaned relative
  90,16,or a poor person in distress
  90,17,and to be one of those who believe and urge one another to steadfastness and compassion
  90,18,Those who do this will be on the right-hand side
  90,19,but those who disbelieve in Our revelations will be on the left-hand side
  90,20,and the Fire will close in on them
