quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,"By the fig, by the olive"
  95,2,by Mount Sinai
  95,3,by this safe town
  95,4,We create man in the finest state
  95,5,then reduce him to the lowest of the low
  95,6,except those who believe and do good deeds––
  95,7,"they will have an unfailing reward. After this, what makes you [man] deny the Judgement"
  95,8,Is God not the most decisive of judges
  96,1,Read! In the name of your Lord who created
  96,2,He created manfrom a clinging form
  96,3,Read! Your Lord is the Most Bountiful One
  96,4,"who taught by [means of] the pen"
  96,5,who taught man what he did not know
  96,6,But man exceeds all bounds
  96,7,when he thinks he is self-sufficient
  96,8,"[Prophet], all will return to your Lord"
  96,9,Have you seen the man who forbids
  96,10,"[Our] servant to pray"
  96,11,Have you seen whether he is rightly guided
  96,12,or encourages true piety
  96,13,Have you seen whether he denies the truth and turns away from it
  96,14,Does he not realize that God sees all
  96,15,"No! If he does not stop, We shall drag him by his forehead––"
  96,16,"his lying, sinful forehead"
  96,17,Let him summon his comrades
  96,18,We shall summon the guards of Hell
  96,19,"No! Do not obey him [Prophet]: bow down in worship and draw close"
