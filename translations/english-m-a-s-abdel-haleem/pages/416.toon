  32,12,"[Prophet], if only you could see the wrongdoers hang their heads before their Lord: ‘Our Lord, now that we have seen and heard, send us back and we shall do good. [Now] we are convinced.’"
  32,13,"‘If it had been Our will, We could certainly have given every soul its true guidance, but My words have come true. “I shall be sure to fill Hell with jinn and men together.”"
  32,14,"So since you ignored the meeting on this Day of yours, now We shall ignore you: taste the lasting suffering for all you have done.’"
  32,15,"The only people who truly believe in Our messages are those who, when they are reminded of them, bow down in worship, cele-brate their Lord’s praises, and do not think themselves above this"
  32,16,Their sides shun their beds in order to pray to their Lord in fear and hope; they give to others some of what We have given them
  32,17,No soul knows what joy is kept hidden in store for them as a reward for what they have done
  32,18,"So, is someone who believes equal to someone who defies God? No, they are not equal"
  32,19,Those who believe and do good deeds will have Gardens awaiting them as their home and as a reward for what they have done
  32,20,"As for those who defy God, their home will be the Fire. Whenever they try to escape it, they will be driven back into it, and they will be told, ‘Taste the torment of the Fire, which you persistently denied.’"
