quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When the sky is torn apart
  82,2,when the stars are scattered
  82,3,when the seas burst forth
  82,4,when graves turn inside out
  82,5,each soul will know what it has done and what it has left undone
  82,6,"Mankind, what has lured you away from God"
  82,7,"your generous Lord, who created you, shaped you, proportioned you"
  82,8,in whatever form He chose
  82,9,Yet you still take the Judgement to be a lie
  82,10,Over you stand
  82,11,"watchers, noble recorders"
  82,12,who know what you do
  82,13,the good will live in bliss
  82,14,and the wicked will burn in the Fire
  82,15,They will enter it on the Day of Judgement
  82,16,and they will find no escape
  82,17,What will explain to you what the Day of Judgement is
  82,18,Yes! What will explain to you what the Day of Judgement is
  82,19,"The Day when no soul will be able to do anything for another; on that Day, command will belong to God"
  83,1,Woe to those who give short measure
  83,2,who demand of other people full measure for themselves
  83,3,but give less than they should when it is they who weigh or measure for others
  83,4,Do these people not realize that they will be raised up
  83,5,on a mighty Day
  83,6,a Day when everyone will stand before the Lord of the Worlds
