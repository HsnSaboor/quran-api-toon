  6,1,Praise belongs to God who created the heavens and the earth and made darkness and light; yet the disbelievers set up equals to their Lord
  6,2,"He is the one who created you from clay and specified a term [for you] and another fixed time, known only to Him; yet still you doubt"
  6,3,"He is God in the heavens and on earth, He knows your secrets and what you reveal, and He knows what you do"
  6,4,"but every time revelation comes to them from their Lord, they turn their backs on it"
  6,5,"So they denied the truth when it came to them, but the very thing they laughed at will be brought home to them"
  6,6,"Do they not realize how many generations We destroyed before them? We established them in the earth more firmly than you, sent down abundant rain on them from the sky and made running rivers flow at their feet, yet We destroyed them for their misdeeds and raised other generations after them"
  6,7,"Even if We had sent down to you [Prophet] a book inscribed on parchment, and they had touched it with their own hands, the disbelievers would still say, ‘This is nothing but blatant sorcery.’"
  6,8,"They say, ‘Why was no angel sent down to [support] him?’ But had We sent down an angel, their judgement would have come at once with no respite given"
