quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,No indeed! The list of the wicked is in Sijjin––
  83,8,what will explain to you what Sijjin is?––
  83,9,a clearly numbered list
  83,10,Woe on that day to the deniers
  83,11,those who deny the Day of Judgement
  83,12,Only the evil aggressor denies it
  83,13,"when Our revelations are recited to him, he says, ‘Ancient fables!’"
  83,14,No indeed! Their hearts are encrusted with what they have done
  83,15,No indeed! On that Day they will be screened offfrom their Lord
  83,16,they will burn in Hell
  83,17,"and they will be told, ‘This is what you called a lie.’"
  83,18,No indeed! The list of the truly good is in 'Illiyyin––
  83,19,what will explain to you what 'Illiyyin is?––
  83,20,a clearly written list
  83,21,witnessed by those brought near
  83,22,The truly good will live in bliss
  83,23,"seated on couches, gazing around"
  83,24,You will recognize on their faces the radiance of bliss
  83,25,They will be served a sealed nectar
  83,26,"its seal [perfumed with] a fragrant herb––let those who strive, strive for this––"
  83,27,mixed with the water of Tasnim
  83,28,a spring from which those brought near will drink
  83,29,The wicked used to laugh at the believers––
  83,30,they would wink at one another when the believers passed by them
  83,31,joke about them when they got back to their own people
  83,32,"and say, when they saw them, ‘These people are misguided,’"
  83,33,though they were not sent to be their keepers
  83,34,so today the believers are laughing at the disbelievers
