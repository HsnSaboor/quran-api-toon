quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,No intercessor’s plea will benefit them now
  74,49,What is the matter with them? Why do they turn away from the warning
  74,50,like frightened asses
  74,51,fleeing from a lion
  74,52,Each one of them demands that a scripture be sent down to him and unrolled before his very eyes
  74,53,No! Truly they have no fear of the life to come
  74,54,but truly this is a reminder
  74,55,Let whoever wishes to take heed do so
  74,56,"they will only take heed if God so wishes. He is the Lord who should be heeded, the Lord of forgiveness"
  75,1,By the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,and by the self-reproaching soul
  75,3,Does man think We shall not put his bones back together
  75,4,"In fact, We can reshape his very fingertips"
  75,5,Yet man wants to deny what is ahead of him
  75,6,"he says, ‘So, when will this Day of Resurrection be?’"
  75,7,When eyes are dazzled
  75,8,and the moon eclipsed
  75,9,when the sun and the moon are brought together
  75,10,"on that Day man will say, ‘Where can I escape?’"
  75,11,"Truly, there is no refuge"
  75,12,they will all return to your Lord on that Day
  75,13,"On that Day, man will be told what he put first and what he put last"
  75,14,"Truly, man is a clear witness against himself"
  75,15,despite all the excuses he may put forward
  75,16,"[Prophet], do not rush your tongue in an attempt to hasten [your memorization of] the Revelation"
  75,17,We shall make sure of its safe collection and recitation
  75,18,"When We have recited it, repeat the recitation"
  75,19,and We shall make it clear
