quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  55,68,With fruits- date palms and pomegranate trees
  55,69,"Which, then, of your Lord’s blessings do you both deny"
  55,70,"There are good-natured, beautiful maidens"
  55,71,"Which, then, of your Lord’s blessings do you both deny"
  55,72,"Dark-eyed, sheltered in pavilions"
  55,73,"Which, then, of your Lord’s blessings do you both deny"
  55,74,Untouched beforehand by man or jinn
  55,75,"Which, then, of your Lord’s blessings do you both deny"
  55,76,They will all sit on green cushions and fine carpets
  55,77,"Which, then, of your Lord’s blessings do you both deny"
  55,78,"Blessed is the name of your Lord, full of majesty, bestowing honour"
  56,1,When that which is coming arrives
  56,2,no one will be able to deny it has come
  56,3,bringing low and raising high
  56,4,When the earth is shaken violently
  56,5,and the mountains are ground to powder
  56,6,and turn to scattered dust
  56,7,then you will be sorted into three classes
  56,8,Those on the Right––what people they are
  56,9,Those on the Left––what people they are
  56,10,And those in front––ahead indeed
  56,11,For these will be the ones brought nearest to God
  56,12,in Gardens of Bliss
  56,13,many from the past
  56,14,and a few from later generations
  56,15,On couches of well-woven cloth
  56,16,they will sit facing each other
