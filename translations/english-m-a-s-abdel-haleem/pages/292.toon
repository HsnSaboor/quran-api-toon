quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  17,97,"[Prophet], anyone God guides is truly guided, and you will find no protector other than Him for anyone He leaves astray. On the Day of Resurrection We shall gather them, lying on their faces, blind, dumb, and deaf. Hell will be their Home. Whenever the Fire goes down, We shall make it blaze more fiercely for them"
  17,98,"This is what they will get for rejecting Our signs and saying, ‘What? When we are turned to bones and dust, how can we be raised in a new act of creation?’"
  17,99,"Do they not see that God, who created the heavens and earth, can create the likes of them [anew]? He has ordained a time for them- there is no doubt about that- but the evildoers refuse everything except disbelief"
  17,100,"Say, ‘If you possessed the very stores of my Lord’s bounty, you would hold them back in your fear of spending: man is ever grudging.’"
  17,101,"In the past, We gave Moses nine clear signs- ask the Children of Israel. When Moses came to [the Egyptians], Pharaoh said to him, ‘Moses, I think you are bewitched.’"
  17,102,"He said, ‘You know very well that only the Lord of the heavens and earth could have sent these signs as clear proof. I think that you, Pharaoh, are doomed.’"
  17,103,"So he wanted to wipe them off the [face of the] earth, but We drowned him and those with him"
  17,104,"After his death, We told the Children of Israel, ‘Live in the land, and when the promise of the Hereafter is fulfilled, We shall bring you to the assembly of all people.’"
