quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,"Yet you [people] prefer the life of this world"
  87,17,even though the Hereafter is better and more lasting
  87,18,All this is in the earlier scriptures
  87,19,the scriptures of Abraham and Moses
  88,1,"Have you heard tell [Prophet] about the Overwhelming Event"
  88,2,"On that Day, there will be downcast faces"
  88,3,toiling and weary
  88,4,as they enter the blazing Fire
  88,5,and are forced to drink from a boiling spring
  88,6,with no food for them except bitter dry thorns
  88,7,that neither nourish nor satisfy hunger
  88,8,On that Day there will also be faces radiant with bliss
  88,9,well pleased with their labour
  88,10,in a lofty garden
  88,11,where they will hear no idle talk
  88,12,with a flowing spring
  88,13,raised couches
  88,14,goblets placed before them
  88,15,cushions set in rows
  88,16,and carpets spread
  88,17,Do the disbelievers not see how rain clouds are formed
  88,18,how the heavens are lifted
  88,19,how the mountains are raised high
  88,20,how the earth is spread out
  88,21,"So [Prophet] warn them: your only task is to give warning"
  88,22,you are not there to control them
  88,23,As for those who turn away and disbelieve
  88,24,God will inflict the greatest torment upon them
  88,25,It is to Us they will return
  88,26,and then it is for Us to call them to account
