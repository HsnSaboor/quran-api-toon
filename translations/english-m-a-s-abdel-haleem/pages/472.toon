quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  40,41,"My people, why do I call you to salvation when you call me to the Fire"
  40,42,"You call me to disbelieve in God and to associate with Him things of which I have no knowledge; I call you to the Mighty, the Forgiving One"
  40,43,"There is no doubt that what you call me to serve is not fit to be invoked either in this world or the Hereafter: our return is to God alone, and it will be the rebels who will inhabit the Fire"
  40,44,"[One Day] you will remember what I am saying to you now, so I commit my case to God: God is well aware of His servants.’"
  40,45,So God saved him from the harm they planned. A terrible punishment engulfed Pharaoh’s people
  40,46,"they will be brought before the Fire morning and evening. On the Day the Hour comes, it will be said, ‘Throw Pharaoh’s people into the worst torment.’"
  40,47,"In the Fire they will quarrel with one another: the weak will say to the haughty, ‘We were your followers, so can you now relieve us from some share of the Fire?’"
  40,48,"but they will say, ‘We are all in this together. God has judged between His creatures.’"
  40,49,"Those in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell, ‘Ask your Lord to lessen our suffering for one day,’"
