quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,26,"and Pharaoh said, ‘Leave me to kill Moses- let him call upon his Lord!- for I fear he may cause you to change your religion, or spread disorder in the land.’"
  40,27,"Moses said, ‘I seek refuge with my Lord and yours from every tyrant who refuses to believe in the Day of Reckoning.’"
  40,28,"A secret believer from Pharaoh’s family said, ‘How can you kill a man just for saying, “My Lord is God”? He has brought you clear signs from your Lord- if he is a liar, on his own head be it- and if he is truthful, then at least some of what he has threatened will happen to you. God does not guide any rebellious, outrageous liar"
  40,29,"My people, as masters in the land you have the power today, but who will help us against God’s might if it comes upon us?’ But Pharaoh said, ‘I have told you what I think; I am guiding you along the right path.’"
  40,30,"The believer said, ‘My people, I fear your fate will be the fate of those others who opposed [their prophets]"
  40,31,"the fate of the people of Noah, Ad, Thamud, and those who came after them- God never wills injustice on His creatures"
  40,32,"My people, I fear for you on the Day you will cry out to one another"
  40,33,the Day you will turn tail and flee with no one to defend you from God! Whoever God leaves to stray will have no one to guide him
