quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,40,‘Are you all coming? We may follow the sorcerers if they win!’
  26,41,"When the sorcerers came, they said to Pharaoh, ‘Shall we be rewarded if we win?’"
  26,42,"and he said, ‘Yes, and you will join my inner court.’"
  26,43,"Moses said to them, ‘Throw down whatever you will.’"
  26,44,"They threw their ropes and staffs, saying, ‘By Pharaoh’s might, we shall be victorious.’"
  26,45,But Moses threw his staff and- lo and behold!- it swallowed up their trickery
  26,46,and the sorcerers fell down on their knees
  26,47,"exclaiming, ‘We believe in the Lord of the Worlds"
  26,48,the Lord of Moses and Aaron.’
  26,49,"Pharaoh said, ‘How dare you believe in him before I have given you permission? He must be the master who taught you sorcery! Soon you will see: I will cut off your alternate hands and feet and then crucify the lot of you!’"
  26,50,"‘That will do us no harm,’ they said, ‘for we are sure to return to our Lord"
  26,51,"We hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins, as we were the first to believe.’"
  26,52,"Then We revealed Our will to Moses, ‘Leave with My servants by night, for you will be pursued!’"
  26,53,"Pharaoh sent messengers into the cities, proclaiming"
  26,54,‘These people are a puny band––
  26,55,they have enraged us
  26,56,"and we are a large army, on the alert.’"
  26,57,So it was that We made them leave their gardens and their springs
  26,58,their treasures and their noble dwellings
  26,59,"We gave [such] things [later]to the Children of Israel"
  26,60,Pharaoh and his people pursued them at sunrise
