quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"Yet they will continue in their disbelief, even if We send a [scorching] wind and they see their crops turn yellow"
  30,52,"You [Prophet] cannot make the dead hear and you cannot make the deaf hear your call when they turn their backs and leave"
  30,53,"you cannot lead the blind out of their error: the only ones you can make hear you are those who believe in Our revelations and devote themselves [to Us]"
  30,54,"It is God who creates you weak, then gives you strength, then weakness after strength, together with your grey hair: He creates what He will; He is the All Knowing, the All Powerful"
  30,55,"On the Day the Hour comes, the guilty will swear they lingered no more than an hour- they have always been deluded"
  30,56,"but those endowed with knowledge and faith will say, ‘In accordance with God’s decree, you actually lingered till the Day of Resurrection: this is the Day of Resurrection, yet you did not know.’"
  30,57,"On that Day the evildoers’ excuses will be of no use to them: they will not be allowed to make amends"
  30,58,"In this Quran We have set every kind of illustration before people, yet if you [Prophet] brought them a miracle, the disbelievers would still say, ‘You [prophets] deal only in falsehood.’"
  30,59,In this way God seals the hearts of those who do not know
  30,60,"so be patient, for God’s promise is true: do not let those with no firm beliefs discourage you"
