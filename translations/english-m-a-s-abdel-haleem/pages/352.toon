quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  24,21,"Believers, do not follow in Satan’s footsteps- if you do so, he will urge you to indecency and evil. If it were not for God’s bounty and mercy towards you, not one of you would ever have attained purity. God purifies whoever He will: God is all hearing, all seeing"
  24,22,"Those who have been graced with bounty and plenty should not swear that they will [no longer] give to kinsmen, the poor, those who emigrated in God’s way: let them pardon and forgive. Do you not wish that God should forgive you? God is most forgiving and merciful"
  24,23,"Those who accuse honourable but unwary believing women are rejected by God, in this life and the next. A painful punishment awaits them"
  24,24,"on the Day when their own tongues, hands, and feet will testify against them about what they have done"
  24,25,"on that Day, God will pay them their just due in full- and they will realize that God is the Truth that makes everything clear"
  24,26,"Corrupt women are for corrupt men, and corrupt men are for corrupt women; good women are for good men and good men are for good women. The good are innocent of what has been said against them; they will have forgiveness and a generous provision"
  24,27,"Believers, do not enter other people’s houses until you have asked permission to do so and greeted those inside- that is best for you: perhaps you will bear this in mind"
