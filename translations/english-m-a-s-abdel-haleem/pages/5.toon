quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,25,"[Prophet], give those who believe and do good the news that they will have Gardens graced with flowing streams. Whenever they are given sustenance from the fruits of these Gardens, they will say, ‘We have been given this before,’ because they were provided with something like it. They will have pure spouses and there they will stay"
  2,26,"God does not shy from drawing comparisons even with something as small as a gnat, or larger: the believers know it is the truth from their Lord, but the disbelievers say, ‘What does God mean by such a comparison?’ Through it He makes many go astray and leads many to the right path. But it is only the rebels He makes go astray"
  2,27,"those who break their covenant with God after it has been confirmed, who sever the bonds that God has commanded to be joined, who spread corruption on the earth- these are the losers"
  2,28,"How can you ignore God when you were lifeless and He gave you life, when He will cause you to die, then resurrect you to be returned to Him"
  2,29,"It was He who created all that is on the earth for you, then turned to the sky and made the seven heavens; it is He who has knowledge of all things"
