quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,55,"The Prophet’s wives are not to blame [if they are seen by] their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons, their sisters’ sons, their women, or their slaves. [Wives of the Prophet], be mindful of God. God observes everything"

  33,59,"Prophet, tell your wives, your daughters, and women believers to make their outer garments hang low over them so as to be recog-nized and not insulted: God is most forgiving, most merciful"
  33,60,"If the hypocrites, the sick at heart, and those who spread lies in the city do not desist, We shall rouse you [Prophet] against them, and then they will only be your neighbours in this city for a short while"
  33,61,"They will be rejected. Wherever they are found, they will be arrested and put to death"
  33,62,This has been God’s practice with those who went before. You will find no change in God’s practices
