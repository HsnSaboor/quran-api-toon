quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He frowned and turned away
  80,2,when the blind man came to him––
  80,3,"for all you know, he might have grown in spirit"
  80,4,or taken note of something useful to him
  80,5,For the self-satisfied one
  80,6,you go out of your way––
  80,7,though you are not to be blamed for his lack of spiritual growth––
  80,8,but from the one who has come to you full of eagerness
  80,9,and awe
  80,10,you allow yourself to be distracted
  80,11,"No indeed! This [Quran] is a lesson"
  80,12,from which those who wish to be taught should learn
  80,13,"[written] on honoured"
  80,14,"exalted, pure pages"
  80,15,by the hands of
  80,16,noble and virtuous scribes
  80,17,Woe to man! How ungrateful he is
  80,18,From what thing does God create him
  80,19,"He creates him from a droplet, He proportions him"
  80,20,He makes the way easy for him
  80,21,then He causes him to die and be buried
  80,22,"When He wills, He will raise him up again"
  80,23,Yet mandoes not fulfil God’s commands
  80,24,Let man consider the food he eats
  80,25,We pour down abundant water
  80,26,and cause the soil to split open
  80,27,We make grain grow
  80,28,"and vines, fresh vegetation"
  80,29,"olive trees, date palms"
  80,30,luscious gardens
  80,31,"fruits, and fodder"
  80,32,all for you and your livestock to enjoy
  80,33,When the Deafening Blast comes––
  80,34,the Day man will flee from his own brother
  80,35,"his mother, his father"
  80,36,"his wife, his children"
  80,37,each of them will be absorbed in concerns of their own on that Day
  80,38,on that Day some faces will be beaming
  80,39,"laughing, and rejoicing"
  80,40,but some faces will be dust-stained
  80,41,and covered in darkness
  80,42,"those are the disbelievers, the licentious"
