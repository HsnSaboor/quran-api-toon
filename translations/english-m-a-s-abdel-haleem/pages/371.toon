quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,give me a good name among later generations
  26,85,make me one of those given the Garden of Bliss
  26,86,"forgive my father, for he is one of those who have gone astray"
  26,87,and do not disgrace me on the Day when all people are resurrected
  26,88,the Day when neither wealth nor children can help
  26,89,when the only one who will be saved is the one who comes before God with a heart devoted to Him.’
  26,90,When the Garden is brought near to the righteous
  26,91,and the Fire is placed in full view of the misguided
  26,92,"it will be said to them, ‘Where are those you worshipped"
  26,93,"beside God? Can they help you now, or even help themselves?’"
  26,94,"and then they will all be hurled into Hell, together with those that misled them"
  26,95,and all Iblis’s supporters
  26,96,"There they will say to their gods, as they bicker among themselves"
  26,97,‘We were clearly misguided
  26,98,when we made you equal with the Lord of the Worlds
  26,99,It was the evildoers who led us astray
  26,100,and now we have no intercessor
  26,101,and no true friend
  26,102,"If only we could live our lives again, we would be true believers!’"
  26,103,"There truly is a sign in this, though most of them do not believe"
  26,104,"your Lord alone is the Almighty, the Merciful"
  26,105,"The people of Noah, too, called the messengers liars"
  26,106,"Their brother Noah said to them, ‘Will you not be mindful of God"
  26,107,I am a faithful messenger sent to you
  26,108,be mindful of God and obey me
  26,109,"I ask no reward of you, for my only reward is with the Lord of the Worlds"
  26,110,be mindful of God and obey me.’
  26,111,"They answered, ‘Why should we believe you when the worst sort of people follow you?’"
