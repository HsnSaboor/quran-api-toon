quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  3,1,Alif Lam Mim
  3,2,"God: there is no god but Him, the Ever Living, the Ever Watchful"
  3,3,"Step by step, He has sent the Scripture down to you [Prophet] with the Truth, confirming what went before: He sent down the Torah and the Gospel"
  3,4,"earlier as a guide for people and He has sent down the distinction [between right and wrong]. Those who deny God’s revelations will suffer severe torment: God is almighty and capable of retribution"
  3,5,Nothing on earth or in heaven is hidden from God
  3,6,"it is He who shapes you all in the womb as He pleases. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Wise"
  3,7,"it is He who has sent this Scripture down to you [Prophet]. Some of its verses are definite in meaning- these are the cornerstone of the Scripture- and others are ambiguous. The perverse at heart eagerly pursue the ambiguities in their attempt to make trouble and to pin down a specific meaning of their own: only God knows the true meaning. Those firmly grounded in knowledge say, ‘We believe in it: it is all from our Lord’- only those with real perception will take heed"
  3,8,"‘Our Lord, do not let our hearts deviate after You have guided us. Grant us Your mercy: You are the Ever Giving"
  3,9,"Our Lord, You will gather all people on the Day of which there is no doubt: God never breaks His promise.’"
