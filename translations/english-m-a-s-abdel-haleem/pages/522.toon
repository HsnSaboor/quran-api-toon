quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"Abraham said, ‘What is your errand, messengers?’"
  51,32,"They said, ‘We are sent to a people lost in sin"
  51,33,to bring down rocks of clay
  51,34,marked by your Lord for those who exceed all bounds.’
  51,35,We brought out such believers as were there
  51,36,We found only one household devoted to God
  51,37,and left the town to be a sign for those who fear the painful punishment
  51,38,"There is another sign in Moses: We sent him to Pharaoh with clear authority"
  51,39,"Pharaoh turned away with his supporters, saying, ‘This is a sorcerer, or maybe a madman,’"
  51,40,"so We seized him and his forces and threw them into the sea: he was to blame"
  51,41,"There is another sign in the Ad: We sent the life-destroying wind against them"
  51,42,and it reduced everything it came up against to shreds
  51,43,"And also in the Thamud: it was said to them, ‘Make the most of your lives for a while,’"
  51,44,"but they rebelled against their Lord’s command, so the blast took them. They looked on helplessly"
  51,45,"they could not even remain standing, let alone defend themselves"
  51,46,Before that We destroyed the people of Noah. They were a truly sinful people
  51,47,We built the heavens with Our power and made them vast
  51,48,We spread out the earth- how well We smoothed it out
  51,49,"and We created pairs of all things so that you [people] might take note"
  51,50,"[So, say to them, Prophet], ‘Quickly, turn to God- I am sent by Him to give you clear warning"
  51,51,and do not set up any other god alongside Him. I am sent by Him to give you clear warning!’
