quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,207,what good would their past enjoyment be to them
  26,208,Never have We destroyed a town without sending down messengers to warn it
  26,209,"as a reminder from Us: We are never unjust"
  26,210,It was not the jinn who brought down this Quran
  26,211,it is neither in their interests nor in their power
  26,212,indeed they are prevented from overhearing it
  26,213,"So [Prophet] do not invoke any gods beside God, or you will incur punishment"
  26,214,Warn your nearest kinsfolk
  26,215,and lower your wing tenderly over the believers who follow you
  26,216,"If they disobey you, say, ‘I bear no responsibility for your actions.’"
  26,217,"Put your trust in the Almighty, the Merciful"
  26,218,"who sees you when you stand up [for prayer]"
  26,219,and sees your movements among the worshippers
  26,220,"He is the All Hearing, the All Knowing"
  26,221,Shall I tell you who the jinn come down to
  26,222,They come down to every lying sinner
  26,223,"who readily lends an ear to them, and most of them are liars"
  26,224,only those who are lost in error follow the poets
  26,225,Do you not see how they rove aimlessly in every valley
  26,226,how they say what they do not do
  26,227,"Not so those [poets] who believe, do good deeds, remember God often, and defend themselves after they have been wronged. The evildoers will find out what they will return to"
