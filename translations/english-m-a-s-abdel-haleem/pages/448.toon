quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  37,52,"who used to ask me, “Do you really believe that"
  37,53,"after we die and become dust and bone, we shall be brought for judgement?”’"
  37,54,"Then he will say, ‘Shall we look for him?’"
  37,55,He will look down and see him in the midst of the Fire
  37,56,"and say to him, ‘By God, you almost brought me to ruin"
  37,57,"Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I too would have been taken to Hell.’"
  37,58,"Then he will say [to his blessed companions], ‘Are we never to die again after our earlier death"
  37,59,Shall we never suffer
  37,60,This truly is the supreme triumph!’
  37,61,Everyone should strive to attain this
  37,62,"Is this the better welcome, or the tree of Zaqqum"
  37,63,which we have made a test for the evildoers
  37,64,This tree grows in the heart of the blazing Fire
  37,65,and its fruits are like devils’ heads
  37,66,They will fill their bellies eating from it
  37,67,then drink scalding water on top of it
  37,68,then return to the blazing Fire
  37,69,They found their forefathers astray
  37,70,"and rushed to follow in their footsteps- before the disbelievers [of Mecca]"
  37,71,most men in the past went astray
  37,72,even though We sent messengers to warn them
  37,73,See how those who were warned met their end
  37,74,Not so the true servants of God
  37,75,"Noah cried to Us, and how excellent was Our response"
  37,76,We saved him and his people from great distress
