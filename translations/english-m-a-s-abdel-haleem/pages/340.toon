quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  22,65,Have you not considered how God has made everything on the earth of service to you? That ships sail the sea at His command? That He keeps the heavens from falling down on the earth without His permission? God is most compassionate and most merciful to mankind
  22,66,"it is He who gave you [people] life, will cause you to die, then will give you life again- but man is ungrateful"
  22,67,"We have appointed acts of devotion for every community to observe, so do not let them argue with you [Prophet] about this matter. Call them to your Lord- you are on the right path"
  22,68,"and if they argue with you, say, ‘God is well aware of what you are doing.’"
  22,69,"On the Day of Resurrection, God will judge between you regarding your differences"
  22,70,"Are you [Prophet] not aware that God knows all that is in the heavens and earth? All this is written in a Record; this is easy for God"
  22,71,"Yet beside God they serve that for which He has sent no authority and of which they have no knowledge: the evildoers will have no one to help them"
  22,72,"[Prophet], you can see the hostility on the faces of the disbelievers when Our messages are recited clearly to them: it is almost as if they are going to attack those who recite Our messages to them. Say, ‘Shall I tell you what is far worse than what you feel now? The Fire that God has promised the disbelievers! What a dismal end!’"
