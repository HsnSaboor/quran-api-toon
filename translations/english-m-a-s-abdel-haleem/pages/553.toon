quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  62,1,"Everything in the heavens and earth glorifies God, the Controller, the Holy One, the Almighty, the Wise"
  62,2,"It is He who raised a mes-senger, among the people who had no Scripture, to recite His revelations to them, to make them grow spiritually and teach them the Scripture and wisdom––before that they were clearly astray––"
  62,3,"to them and others yet to join them. He is the Almighty, the Wise"
  62,4,such is God’s favour that He grants it to whoever He will; God’s favour is immense
  62,5,"Those who have been charged to obey the Torah, but do not do so, are like asses carrying books: how base such people are who disobey God’s revelations! God does not guide people who do wrong"
  62,6,"Say [Prophet], ‘You who follow the Jewish faith, if you truly claim that out of all people you alone are friends of God, then you should be hoping for death.’"
  62,7,But because of what they have stored up for themselves with their own hands they would never hope for death––God knows the wrongdoers very well––
  62,8,"so say, ‘The death you run away from will come to meet you and you will be returned to the One who knows the unseen as well as the seen: He will tell you everything you have done.’"
