quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star when it sets
  53,2,Your companion has not strayed; he is not deluded
  53,3,he does not speak from his own desire
  53,4,The Quran is nothing less than a revelation that is sent to him
  53,5,"It was taught to him by [an angel] with mighty powers"
  53,6,"and great strength, who stood"
  53,7,on the highest horizon
  53,8,and then approached––coming down
  53,9,until he was two bow-lengths away or even closer––
  53,10,and revealed to God’s servant what He revealed
  53,11,"[The Prophet’s] own heart did not distort what he saw"
  53,12,Are you going to dispute with him what he saw with his own eyes
  53,13,A second time he saw him
  53,14,by the lote tree beyond which none may pass
  53,15,near the Garden of Restfulness
  53,16,"when the tree was covered in nameless [splendour]"
  53,17,"His sight never wavered, nor was it too bold"
  53,18,and he saw some of the greatest signs of his Lord
  53,19,"[Disbelievers], consider al-Lat and al-Uzza"
  53,20,"and the third one, Manat––"
  53,21,are you to have the male and He the female
  53,22,That would be a most unjust distribution!––
  53,23,"these are nothing but names you have invented yourselves, you and your forefathers. God has sent no authority for them. These people merely follow guesswork and the whims of their souls, even though guidance has come to them from their Lord"
  53,24,Is man to have everything he wishes for
  53,25,when the present life and the life to come belong only to God
  53,26,"There are many angels in heaven whose intercession will be of no use until God gives permission to those He will, whose words He will accept"
