quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  20,99,"In this way We relate to you [Prophet] stories of what happened before. We have given you a Quran from Us"
  20,100,Whoever turns away from it will bear on the Day of Resurrection a heavy burden
  20,101,and will remain under it. What a terrible burden to carry on that Day
  20,102,"When the trumpet is sounded and We gather the sinful, sightless"
  20,103,"they will murmur to one another, ‘You stayed only ten days [on earth]’"
  20,104,"We know best what they say- but the more perceptive of them will say, ‘Your stay [on earth] was only a single day.’"
  20,105,"They ask you [Prophet] about the mountains: say, ‘[On that Day] my Lord will blast them into dust"
  20,106,and leave a flat plain
  20,107,with no peak or trough to be seen
  20,108,"On that Day, people will follow the summoner from whom there is no escape; every voice will be hushed for the Lord of Mercy; only whispers will be heard"
  20,109,"On that Day, intercession will be useless except from those to whom the Lord of Mercy has granted permission and whose words He approves"
  20,110,"He knows what is before and behind them, though they do not comprehend Him"
  20,111,"and [all] faces will be humbled before the Living, Ever Watchful One. Those burdened with evil deeds will despair"
  20,112,but whoever has done righteous deeds and believed need have no fear of injustice or deprivation.’
  20,113,"We have sent the Quran down in the Arabic tongue and given all kinds of warnings in it, so that they may beware or take heed"
