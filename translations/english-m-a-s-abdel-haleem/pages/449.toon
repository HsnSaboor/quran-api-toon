  37,78,We let him be praised by later generations
  37,79,‘Peace be upon Noah among all the nations!’
  37,80,This is how We reward those who do good
  37,81,he was truly one of Our faithful servants
  37,82,We drowned the rest
  37,83,Abraham was of the same faith
  37,84,he came to his Lord with a devoted heart
  37,85,"He said to his father and his people, ‘What are you worshipping"
  37,86,How can you choose false gods instead of the true God
  37,87,So what is your opinion about the Lord of all the Worlds?’
  37,88,then he looked up to the stars
  37,89,"He said, ‘I am sick,’"
  37,90,"so [his people] turned away from him and left"
  37,91,He turned to their gods and said
  37,92,‘Do you not eat? Why do you not speak?’
  37,93,then he turned and struck them with his right arm
  37,94,His people hurried towards him
  37,95,"but he said, ‘How can you worship things you carve with your own hands"
  37,96,when it is God who has created you and all your handiwork?’
  37,97,"They said, ‘Build a pyre and throw him into the blazing fire.’"

  37,100,"Lord, grant me a righteous son,’"
  37,101,so We gave him the good news that he would have a patient son
  37,102,"When the boy was old enough to work with his father, Abraham said, ‘My son, I have seen myself sacrificing you in a dream. What do you think?’ He said, ‘Father, do as you are commanded and, God willing, you will find me steadfast.’"
