quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,His Lord called out to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa
  79,17,"‘Go to Pharaoh, for he has exceeded all bounds"
  79,18,"and ask him, “Do you want to purify yourself [of sin]"
  79,19,"Do you want me to guide you to your Lord, so that you may hold Him in awe?” ’"
  79,20,Moses showed him the great sign
  79,21,"but he denied it and refused [the faith]"
  79,22,He turned away and hastily
  79,23,"gathered his people, proclaiming"
  79,24,"‘I am your supreme lord,’"
  79,25,so God condemned him to punishment in the life to come as well as in this life
  79,26,there truly is a lesson in this for anyone who stands in awe of God
  79,27,"Which is harder to create: you people or the sky that He built"
  79,28,raising it high and perfecting it
  79,29,giving darkness to its night and bringing out its morning brightness
  79,30,"and the earth, too, He spread out"
  79,31,bringing waters and pastures out of it
  79,32,"and setting firm mountains [in it]"
  79,33,for you and your animals to enjoy
  79,34,When the great overwhelming event arrives
  79,35,on the Day that man remembers what he has done
  79,36,and Hell is there for all to see
  79,37,for anyone who has transgressed
  79,38,and preferred the present life
  79,39,Hell will be home
  79,40,for anyone who feared the meeting with his Lord and restrained himself from base desires
  79,41,Paradise will be home
  79,42,"They ask you [Prophet] about the Hour"
  79,43,"saying, ‘When will it arrive?’, but how can you tell [them that]"
  79,44,Its time is known only to your Lord
  79,45,you are only sent to warn those who fear it
  79,46,"On the Day they see it, it will seem they lingered [in this life] an evening [at most,] or its morning"
