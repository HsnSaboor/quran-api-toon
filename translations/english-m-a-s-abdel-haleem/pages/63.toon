quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,101,How can you disbelieve when God’s revelations are being recited to you and His Messenger is living among you? Whoever holds fast to God will be guided to the straight path
  3,102,"You who believe, be mindful of God, as is His due, and make sure you devote yourselves to Him, to your dying moment"
  3,103,"Hold fast to God’s rope all together; do not split into factions. Remember God’s favour to you: you were enemies and then He brought your hearts together and you became brothers by His grace; you were about to fall into a pit of Fire and He saved you from it- in this way God makes His revelations clear to you so that you may be rightly guided"
  3,104,"Be a community that calls for what is good, urges what is right, and forbids what is wrong: those who do this are the successful ones"
  3,105,"Do not be like those who, after they have been given clear revelation, split into factions and fall into disputes: a terrible punishment awaits such people"
  3,106,"On the Day when some faces brighten and others darken, it will be said to those with darkened faces, ‘How could you reject your faith after believing? Taste the torment for doing so,’"
  3,107,"but those with brightened faces will be in God’s grace, there to remain"
  3,108,"These are God’s revelations: We recite them to you [Prophet] with the Truth. God does not will injustice for His creatures"
