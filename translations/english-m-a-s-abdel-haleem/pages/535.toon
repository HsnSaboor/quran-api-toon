quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,everlasting youths will go round among them
  56,18,"with glasses, flagons, and cups of a pure drink"
  56,19,that causes no headache or intoxication
  56,20,"[there will be] any fruit they choose"
  56,21,the meat of any bird they like
  56,22,and beautiful companions
  56,23,like hidden pearls
  56,24,a reward for what they used to do
  56,25,They will hear no idle or sinful talk there
  56,26,only clean and wholesome speech
  56,27,"Those on the Right, what people they are"
  56,28,They will dwell amid thornless lote trees
  56,29,and clustered acacia
  56,30,with spreading shade
  56,31,constantly flowing water
  56,32,abundant fruits
  56,33,"unfailing, unforbidden"
  56,34,with incomparable companions
  56,35,We have specially created––
  56,36,virginal
  56,37,"loving, of matching age––"
  56,38,for those on the Right
  56,39,many from the past
  56,40,and many from later generations
  56,41,"But those on the Left, what people they are"
  56,42,They will dwell amid scorching wind and scalding water
  56,43,in the shadow of black smoke
  56,44,neither cool nor refreshing
  56,45,"Before, they overindulged in luxury"
  56,46,and persisted in great sin
  56,47,"always saying, ‘What? When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then be raised up"
  56,48,And our earliest forefathers too?’
  56,49,"Say [Prophet], ‘The earliest and latest generations"
  56,50,will all be gathered on a predetermined Day
