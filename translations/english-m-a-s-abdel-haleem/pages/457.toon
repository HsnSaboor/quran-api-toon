  38,63,and took as a laughing-stock? Have our eyes missed them?’
  38,64,"This is how it will really be: the inhabitants of the Fire will blame one another in this way"
  38,65,"[Prophet] say, ‘I am only here to give warning. There is no god but God the One, the All Powerful"
  38,66,"Lord of the heavens and earth and everything between, the Almighty, the Most Forgiving.’"
  38,67,"Say, ‘This message is a mighty one"
  38,68,yet you ignore it
  38,69,I have no knowledge of what those on high discuss
