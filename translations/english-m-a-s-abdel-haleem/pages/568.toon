quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,so today he has no real friend here
  69,36,and the only food he has is the filth
  69,37,that only sinners eat.’
  69,38,So I swear by what you can see
  69,39,and by what you cannot see
  69,40,"this [Quran] is the speech of an honoured messenger"
  69,41,not the words of a poet- how little you believe
  69,42,nor the words of a soothsayer- how little you reflect
  69,43,"This [Quran] is a message sent down from the Lord of the Worlds"
  69,44,"if [the Prophet] had attributed some fabrication to Us"
  69,45,We would certainly have seized his right hand
  69,46,and cut off his lifeblood
  69,47,and none of you could have defended him
  69,48,"This [Quran] is a reminder for those who are aware of God"
  69,49,We know that some of you consider it to be lies
  69,50,this will be a source of bitter regret for the disbelievers
  69,51,but it is in fact the certain Truth
  69,52,"So [Prophet] glorify the name of your Lord, the Almighty"
  70,1,"A man [mockingly] demanded the punishment"
  70,2,It will fall on the disbelievers––none can deflect it––
  70,3,"from God, the Lord of the Ways of Ascent"
  70,4,"by which the angels and the Spirit ascend to Him, on a Day whose length is fifty thousand years"
  70,5,"So be patient, [Prophet], as befits you"
  70,6,The disbelievers think it is distant
  70,7,but We know it to be close
  70,8,On a Day when the heavens will be like molten brass
  70,9,and the mountains like tufts of wool
  70,10,when no friend will ask about his friend
