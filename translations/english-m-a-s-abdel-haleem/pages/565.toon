quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  68,16,We shall brand him on the snout
  68,17,"We have tried them as We tried the owners of a certain garden, who swore that they would harvest its fruits in the morning"
  68,18,"and made no allowance [for the Will of God]"
  68,19,a disaster from your Lord struck the garden as they slept
  68,20,"and by morning it was stripped bare, a desolate land"
  68,21,Still they called each other at daybreak
  68,22,"‘Go early to your field if you wish to gather all its fruits,’"
  68,23,"and went off, whispering"
  68,24,‘Make sure no poor person enters the garden today!’––
  68,25,"they left early, bent on their purpose"
  68,26,"but when they saw the garden, they said, ‘We must have lost our way"
  68,27,No- we are ruined!’
  68,28,"The wisest of them said, ‘Did I not say to you, “Will you not glorify God?”’"
  68,29,"they said, ‘Glory be to God, Our Lord! Truly, we were doing wrong!’"
  68,30,and then they turned to each other in mutual reproach
  68,31,"They said, ‘Alas for us! We have done terrible wrong"
  68,32,"but maybe our Lord will give us something better in its place: we truly turn to Him in hope.’"
  68,33,"Such is the punishment [in this life], but greater still is the punishment in the Hereafter, if only they knew"
  68,34,There will be Gardens of bliss for those who are mindful of God
  68,35,Should We treat those who submit to Us as We treat those who do evil
  68,36,What is the matter with you? On what basis do you judge
  68,37,Do you have a Scripture that tells you
  68,38,that you will be granted whatever you choose
  68,39,"Have you received from Us solemn oaths, binding to the Day of Resurrection, that you will get whatever you yourselves decide"
  68,40,"Ask them [Prophet] which of them will guarantee this"
  68,41,"Do they have ‘partners’ [besides God]? Let them produce their ‘partners’, if what they say is true"
  68,42,"On the Day when matters become dire, they will be invited to prostrate themselves but will be prevented from doing so"
