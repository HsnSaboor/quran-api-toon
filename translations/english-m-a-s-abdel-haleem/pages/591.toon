quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,By the sky and the night-comer––
  86,2,What will explain to you what the night-comer is
  86,3,The piercing star––
  86,4,there is a watcher over every soul
  86,5,Man should reflect on what he was created from
  86,6,He is created from spurting fluid
  86,7,then he emerges from between the backbone and breastbone
  86,8,God is certainly able to bring him back to life
  86,9,On the Day when secrets are laid bare
  86,10,he will have no power and no one to help him
  86,11,By the sky and its recurring rain
  86,12,by the earth that cracks open
  86,13,This is truly a decisive statement
  86,14,it is not something to be taken lightly
  86,15,They plot and scheme
  86,16,but so do I
  86,17,"[Prophet], let the disbelievers be, let them be for a while"
  87,1,"[Prophet], glorify the name of your Lord the Most High"
  87,2,"who created [all things] in due proportion"
  87,3,who determined their destinies and guided them
  87,4,who brought out the green pasture
  87,5,then made it dark debris
  87,6,"[Prophet], We shall teach you [the Quran] and you will not forget––"
  87,7,unless God wishes; He knows both what is open and what is hidden––
  87,8,We shall show you the easy way
  87,9,"So remind, if reminding will help"
  87,10,Those who stand in awe of God will heed the reminder
  87,11,but it will be ignored by the most wicked
  87,12,who will enter the Great Fire
  87,13,where they will neither die nor live
  87,14,Prosperous are those who purify themselves
  87,15,"remember the name of their Lord, and pray"
