  35,31,"The Scripture We have revealed to you [Prophet] is the Truth and confirms the scriptures that preceded it. God is well informed about His servants, He sees everything"
  35,32,"We gave the Scripture as a heritage to Our chosen servants: some of them wronged their own souls, some stayed between [right and wrong], and some, by God’s leave, were foremost in good deeds. That is the greatest favour"
  35,33,"they will enter lasting Gardens where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, where they will wear silk garments"
  35,34,"They will say, ‘Praise be to God, who has separated us from all sorrow! Our Lord is truly most forgiving, most appreciative"
  35,35,"He has, in His bounty, settled us in the everlasting Home where no toil or fatigue will touch us.’"
  35,36,"But those who reject the truth will stay in Hellfire, where they will neither be finished off by death, nor be relieved from Hell’s torment: this is how We reward hardened disbelievers"
  35,37,"They will cry out loud in Hell, ‘Lord, let us out, and we will do righteous deeds, not what we did before!’- ‘ Did We not give you a life long enough to take warning if you were going to? The warner came to you, now taste the punishment.’ The evildoers will have nobody to help them"
  35,38,God knows all that is hidden in the heavens and earth; He knows the thoughts contained in the heart
