  18,62,"They journeyed on, and then Moses said to his servant, ‘Give us our lunch! This journey of ours is very tiring,’"
  18,63,"and [the servant] said, ‘Remember when we were resting by the rock? I forgot the fish- Satan made me forget to pay attention to it- and it [must have] made its way into the sea.’ ‘How strange!’"
  18,64,"Moses said, ‘Then that was the place we were looking for.’ So the two turned back, retraced their footsteps"
  18,65,and found one of Our servants- a man to whom We had granted Our mercy and whom We had given knowledge of Our own
  18,66,"Moses said to him, ‘May I follow you so that you can teach me some of the right guidance you have been taught?’"
  18,67,"The man said, ‘You will not be able to bear with me patiently"
  18,68,How could you be patient in matters beyond your knowledge?’
  18,69,"Moses said, ‘God willing, you will find me patient. I will not disobey you in any way.’"
  18,70,"The man said, ‘If you follow me then, do not query anything I do before I mention it to you myself.’"
  18,71,"They travelled on. Later, when they got into a boat, and the man made a hole in it, Moses said, ‘How could you make a hole in it? Do you want to drown its passengers? What a strange thing to do!’"
  18,72,"He replied, ‘Did I not tell you that you would never be able to bear with me patiently?’"
  18,73,"Moses said, ‘Forgive me for forgetting. Do not make it too hard for me to follow you.’"
