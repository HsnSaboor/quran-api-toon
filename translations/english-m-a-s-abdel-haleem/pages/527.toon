quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  53,27,Those who deny the life to come give the angels female names
  53,28,"They have no knowledge to base this on: they merely follow guesswork. Guesswork is of no value against the Truth"
  53,29,"So [Prophet] ignore those who turn away from Our revelation, who want only the life of this world"
  53,30,Their knowledge does not go beyond that. Your Lord knows best who strays from His path and who follows guidance
  53,31,"Everything in the heavens and earth belongs to God. He will repay those who do evil according to their deeds, and reward, with what is best, those who do good"
  53,32,"As for those who avoid grave sins and foul acts, though they may commit small sins, your Lord is ample in forgiveness. He has been aware of you from the time He produced you from the earth and from your hiding places in your mothers’ wombs, so do not assert your own goodness:He knows best who is mindful of Him"
  53,33,"[Prophet], consider that man who turned away"
  53,34,he only gave a little and then he stopped
  53,35,"Does he have knowledge of the Unseen? Can he see [the Hereafter]"
  53,36,Has he not been told what was written in the Scriptures of Moses
  53,37,"and of Abraham, who fulfilled his duty"
  53,38,that no soul shall bear the burden of another
  53,39,that man will only have what he has worked towards
  53,40,that his labour will be seen
  53,41,and that in the end he will be repaid in full for it
  53,42,that the final goal is your Lord
  53,43,that it is He who makes people laugh and weep
  53,44,that it is He who gives death and life
