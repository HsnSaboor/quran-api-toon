quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  3,187,"God took a pledge from those who were given the Scripture- ‘Make it known to people; do not conceal it’- but they tossed the pledge over their shoulders, they bartered it for a small price: what a bad bargain they made"
  3,188,"Do not think [Prophet] that those who exult in what they have done and seek praise for things they have not done will escape the torment; agonizing torment awaits them"
  3,189,Control of the heavens and earth belongs to God; God has power over everything
  3,190,"There truly are signs in the creation of the heavens and earth, and in the alternation of night and day, for those with understanding"
  3,191,"who remember God standing, sitting, and lying down, who reflect on the creation of the heavens and earth: ‘Our Lord! You have not created all this without purpose- You are far above that!- so protect us from the torment of the Fire"
  3,192,Our Lord! You will truly humiliate those You commit to the Fire. The evildoers have no one to help them
  3,193,"Our Lord! We have heard someone calling us to faith- “ Believe in your Lord”- and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, wipe out our bad deeds, and grant that we join the righteous when we die"
  3,194,Our Lord! Bestow upon us all that You have promised us through Your messengers- do not humiliate us on the Day of Resurrection- You never break Your promise.’
