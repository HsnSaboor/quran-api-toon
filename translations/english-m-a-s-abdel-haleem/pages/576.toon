quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,He planned and plotted––
  74,19,devilishly he plotted
  74,20,ferociously he plotted!––
  74,21,and looked
  74,22,and frowned and scowled
  74,23,and turned away and behaved arrogantly
  74,24,"and said, ‘This is just old sorcery"
  74,25,just the talk of a mortal!’
  74,26,I will throw him into the scorching Fire
  74,27,What will explain to you what the scorching Fire is
  74,28,It spares nothing and leaves nothing
  74,29,it scorches the flesh of humans
  74,30,there are nineteen in charge of it––
  74,31,"none other than angels appointed by Us to guard Hellfire- and We have made their number a test for the disbelievers. So those who have been given the Scripture will be certain and those who believe will have their faith increased: neither those who have been given the Scripture nor the believers will have any doubts, but the sick at heart and the disbelievers will say, ‘What could God mean by this description?’ God leaves whoever He will to stray and guides whoever He will- no one knows your Lord’s forces except Him- this [description] is a warning to mortals"
  74,32,Yes––by the moon
  74,33,By the departing night
  74,34,By the shining dawn
  74,35,It is one of the mightiest things
  74,36,a warning to all mortals
  74,37,to those of you who choose to go ahead and those who lag behind
  74,38,Every soul is held in pledge for its deeds
  74,39,but the Companions of the Right will stay
  74,40,in Gardens and ask
  74,41,about the guilty
  74,42,"‘What drove you to the Scorching Fire?’ [they will ask]"
  74,43,"and they will answer, ‘We did not pray"
  74,44,we did not feed the poor
  74,45,"we indulged with others [in mocking the believers]"
  74,46,we denied the Day of Judgement
  74,47,until the Certain End came upon us.’
