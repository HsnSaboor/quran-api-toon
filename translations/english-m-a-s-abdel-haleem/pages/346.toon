quran[15]{c,v,t}:
  23,60,who always give with hearts that tremble at the thought that they must return to Him
  23,61,"are the ones who race toward good things, and they will be the first to get them"
  23,62,We do not burden any soul with more than it can bear- We have a Record that tells the truth- they will not be wronged
  23,63,"But the disbelievers’ hearts are steeped [in ignorance of ] all this; and there are other things besides this that they do"
  23,64,"When We bring Our punishment on those corrupted with wealth, they will cry for help"
  23,65,"‘Do not cry out today: you will get no help from Us"
  23,66,"Time and time again My messages were recited to you, but you turned arrogantly on your heels"
  23,67,"and spent the evening making fun of [the Quran].’"
  23,68,Have they not contemplated the Word of God? Has something come to them that did not come to their forefathers
  23,69,Do they not recognize their Messenger? So why do they reject him
  23,70,Why do they say he is possessed? He has brought them the truth and most of them hate it
  23,71,"but if the truth were in accordance with their desires, the heavens, the earth, and everyone in them would disintegrate. We have brought them their Reminder and they turn away from it"
  23,72,"Do you [Prophet] ask them for any payment? Your Lord’s is the best payment: He is the Best of Providers"
  23,73,You call them to a straight path
  23,74,and those who do not believe in the Hereafter turn away from that path
