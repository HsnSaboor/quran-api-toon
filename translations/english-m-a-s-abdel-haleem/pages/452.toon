quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you? How do you form your judgements
  37,155,Do you not reflect
  37,156,Do you perhaps have clear authority
  37,157,"Bring your scriptures, if you are telling the truth"
  37,158,"They claim that He has kinship with the jinn, yet the jinn themselves know that they will be brought before Him"
  37,159,God is far above what they attribute to Him
  37,160,the true servants of God do not do such things
  37,161,and neither you nor what you worship
  37,162,can lure away from God any
  37,163,except those who will burn in Hell
  37,164,"[The angels say], ‘Every single one of us has his appointed place"
  37,165,we are ranged in ranks
  37,166,We glorify God.’
  37,167,"[The disbelievers] used to say"
  37,168,‘If only we had a scripture like previous people
  37,169,"we would be true servants of God,’"
  37,170,"yet now they reject [the Quran]. They will soon realize"
  37,171,Our word has already been given to Our servants the messengers
  37,172,it is they who will be helped
  37,173,and the ones who support Our cause will be the winners
  37,174,"So [Prophet] turn away from the disbelievers for a while"
  37,175,"Watch them: they will soon see"
  37,176,Do they really wish to hasten Our punishment
  37,177,"When it descends on their courtyards, how ter-rible that morning will be for those who were warned"
  37,178,"[Prophet], turn away from the disbelievers for a while"
  37,179,"Watch them: they will soon see"
  37,180,"Your Lord, the Lord of Glory, is far above what they attribute to Him"
  37,181,Peace be upon the messengers
  37,182,and praise be to God the Lord of all the Worlds
