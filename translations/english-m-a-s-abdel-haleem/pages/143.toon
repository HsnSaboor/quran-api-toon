  6,119,"Why should you not eat such animals when God has already fully explained what He has forbidden you, except when forced by hunger? But many lead others astray by their desires, without any true knowledge: your Lord knows best who oversteps the limit"
  6,120,"Avoid committing sin, whether openly or in secret, for those who commit sin will be repaid for what they do"
  6,121,"and do not eat anything over which God’s name has not been pronounced, for that is breaking the law. The evil ones incite their followers to argue with you: if you listen to them, you too will become idolaters"
  6,122,"Is a dead person brought back to life by Us, and given light with which to walk among people, comparable to someone trapped in deep darkness who cannot escape? In this way the evil deeds of the disbelievers are made to seem alluring to them"
  6,123,"And so We have put chief evildoers in every city to perpetrate their schemes there- but they scheme only against themselves, without realizing it"
  6,124,"When a revelation is brought before them they say, ‘We shall not believe unless we ourselves are given a revelation as God’s messengers were.’ But God knows best where to place His messages: humiliation before God and severe torment will befall the evildoers for their scheming"
