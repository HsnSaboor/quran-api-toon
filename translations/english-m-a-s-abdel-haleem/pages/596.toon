quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,in which none but the most wicked one will burn
  92,16,"who denied [the truth], and turned away"
  92,17,The most pious one will be spared this––
  92,18,who gives his wealth away as self-purification
  92,19,not to return a favour to anyone
  92,20,but for the sake of his Lord the Most High––
  92,21,and he will be well pleased
  93,1,By the morning brightness
  93,2,and by the night when it grows still
  93,3,"your Lord has not forsaken you [Prophet], nor does He hate you"
  93,4,and the future will be better for you than the past
  93,5,your Lord is sure to give you so much that you will be well satisfied
  93,6,Did He not find you an orphan and shelter you
  93,7,Did He not find you lost and guide you
  93,8,Did He not find you in need and make you self-sufficient
  93,9,So do not be harsh with the orphan
  93,10,and do not chide the one who asks for help
  93,11,talk about the blessings of your Lord
  94,1,"Did We not relieve your heart for you [Prophet]"
  94,2,and remove the burden
  94,3,that weighed so heavily on your back
  94,4,and raise your reputation high
  94,5,So truly where there is hardship there is also ease
  94,6,truly where there is hardship there is also ease
  94,7,"The moment you are freed [of one task] work on"
  94,8,and turn to your Lord for everything
