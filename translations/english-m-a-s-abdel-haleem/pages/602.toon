quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  106,1,"[He did this] to make the Quraysh feel secure"
  106,2,secure in their winter and summer journeys
  106,3,So let them worship the Lord of this House
  106,4,"who provides them with food to ward off hunger, safety to ward off fear"
  107,1,"[Prophet], have you considered the person who denies the Judgement"
  107,2,It is he who pushes aside the orphan
  107,3,and does not urge others to feed the needy
  107,4,So woe to those who pray
  107,5,but are heedless of their prayer
  107,6,those who are all show
  107,7,and forbid common kindnesses
  108,1,"We have truly given abundance to you [Prophet]––"
  108,2,so pray to your Lord and make your sacrifice to Him alone––
  108,3,it is the one who hates you who has been cut off
