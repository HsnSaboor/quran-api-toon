  16,106,"Whoever rejects his faith in Allah after having believed in Him — not the one who is compelled (to utter a word of disbelief) under duress while his heart is at peace with Faith, but the one who has laid his breast wide open for disbelief — upon such people is the wrath of Allah, and for them there is a heavy punishment"
