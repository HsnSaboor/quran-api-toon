quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  47,20,"And the believers say, .Why has a (new) Surah not been revealed?. Then, once an operative Surah is sent down, and fighting (in Allah‘s way) is mentioned in it, you notice those who have disease in their hearts, looking to you like one who is faint because of death. So, destruction is very close to them"
  47,21,"The (reality of their) obedience and (truthfulness of their) speech is fully known (as being mere deception). So, had they been truthful to Allah when the matter had become serious, it would have been much better for them"
  47,22,"So, (O hypocrites,) do you not apprehend that, in case you turn away (from Jihad ), you will spread disorder in the land and will sever your ties of kinship"
  47,23,"Those are the ones whom Allah has cursed; so He has made them deaf, and made their eyes blind"
  47,24,"Then, do they not give serious thought to the Qur‘an, or do they have locks on their hearts"
  47,25,"Surely those who turn back after the guidance has appeared to them clearly, it is Satan who has tempted them and involved them in far-fetched fancies"
  47,26,"That is because they say to those who hate that which Allah has revealed, .We will obey you in some respects. And Allah knows their secret talk"
  47,27,"So, how (miserable) will they be when the angels will exact their souls, smiting their faces and their backs"
  47,28,"That is because they followed that which has angered Allah, and they disliked His pleasure; therefore He has nullified their deeds"
  47,29,Do those having malady in their hearts think that Allah will never expose their grudges (against Islam)
