quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  58,12,"O you who believe, when you consult the Messenger in private, then offer something in charity before your consultation. That is better for you and purer. But if you find nothing (to offer), then Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful"
  58,13,"Have you become afraid of offering charities before your consultation? So when you did not do so, and Allah has forgiven you, then establish Salah, and pay Zakah, and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah is well aware of what you do"
  58,14,Have you not seen those who have friendship with a people with whom Allah is angry. They are neither of you nor of them. They swear false oaths while they know
  58,15,"Allah has prepared a severe punishment for them. Indeed, evil is what they have been doing"
  58,16,"They have taken their oaths as a shield, and then have prevented (people) from the way of Allah. Therefore, for them there is a humiliating punishment"
  58,17,Their riches and their children will never benefit them against Allah. They are the inmates of the Fire. They will live there forever
  58,18,"the Day Allah will raise all of them, and they will swear before Him as they swear before you, and will think that they have something to stand upon. Be assured that they are sheer liars"
  58,19,The ShaiTan (Satan) has prevailed upon them; so he has made them neglect to remember Allah. They are the party of ShaiTan . Be assured that it is (the members of the) party of ShaiTan that are the losers
  58,20,"Indeed, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, they are among the lowest"
  58,21,"Allah has written (in His pre-destined decree), .I will certainly prevail, both I and My messengers. Surely Allah is All-Strong, All-Mighty"
