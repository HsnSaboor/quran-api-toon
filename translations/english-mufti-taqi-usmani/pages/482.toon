quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,47,"To Him alone the knowledge of the Hour (the exact time of Doomsday) is to be referred. No fruits come out of their sheaths, nor does a female conceive a baby, nor does she deliver it, but with His knowledge. And (remember) the Day when He will call them: .Where are My partners?. They will say, .We declare to you that no one of us is to testify (that you have partners)"
  41,48,"And whatever they used to invoke earlier will vanish from them, and they will realize that they have no way to escape"
  41,49,"Man does not get weary of craving for (all sorts of ) good things; and if he is touched by some evil, he is disappointed, devoid of any hope"
  41,50,"And if We give him a taste of some mercy from Us after some hardship that has touched him, he will surely say, .This is my right. And I do not think the Hour (the Day of Judgment) is going to occur. And even if I am brought back to my Lord, I will surely have the best (life) with Him (too). So, We will let the disbelievers know what they did, and let them taste a stern punishment"
  41,51,"When We bestow Our favor upon man, he avoids (to appreciate it) and keeps himself far aside (from obedience), and when some evil touches him, he is full of lengthy prayers"
  41,52,"Say (to the disbelievers), .Tell me, if it (the Qur‘an) is from Allah, and still you reject it, then who can be more erroneous than him who is (involved) in far reaching schism"
  41,53,We will show them Our signs in the universe and within their own beings until it will become manifest to them that it is the truth. Is it not enough about your Lord that He is witness to everything
  41,54,"Beware, they are in doubt about meeting their Lord. Beware, He is the One who encompasses everything"
