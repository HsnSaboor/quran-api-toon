quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  24,21,"O you who believe, do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Whoever follows the footsteps of Satan, (should know that) he orders (one to commit) shameful acts and evil deeds. Had it not been for the grace of Allah upon you, and His mercy, not a single person from you would have ever attained purity. But Allah purifies whomsoever He wills. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
  24,22,"The men of grace and wealth among you should not swear against giving (their charitable gifts) to the kinsmen and the poor and to those who have migrated in the way of Allah, and they should forgive and forego. Do you not like that Allah forgives you? Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very- Merciful"
  24,23,"Surely, those who level a false charge against the chaste, natve and believing women are cursed in this world and the Hereafter, and for them there is a mighty punishment"
  24,24,"on the Day when their tongues, their hands and their legs will testify against themselves of what they used to do"
  24,25,"On that day Allah will give them their rightful recompense in full, and they will know that Allah is the Very Truth who makes all things manifest"
  24,26,"Vile women are for vile men, and vile men are for vile women; and good women are for good men, and good men are for good women. Those are free from what they (the accusers) say. For them there is forgiveness, and a graceful provision"
  24,27,"O you who believe, do not enter any houses, other than your own houses unless you seek permission and greet their inmates with Salam . That is good for you, so that you may be heedful"
