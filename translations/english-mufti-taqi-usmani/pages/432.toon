quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  34,32,"Those who were overbearing will say to those weak, .Had we stopped you from (accepting) guidance after it came to you? Rather, you yourselves were guilty"
  34,33,"And those weak will say to those overbearing, .But (it was your) intriguing day and night (that stopped us from accepting guidance), when you were directing us to disbelieve in Allah and to set up rivals to Him. And all of them will conceal (their) regrets when they will see the punishment. And We will place iron-collars around the necks of those who disbelieved. They will not be recompensed except for what they used to do"
  34,34,"We did not send a warner to a township, but said those who lived a luxurious life in it, .We reject what you have been sent with"
  34,35,"And they said, .We are superior in riches and children, and we are not going to be punished"
  34,36,"Say, .In fact, my Lord extends provision to whom He wills, and straitens (it for whom He wills), but most of the people do not know"
  34,37,"Your riches or your children are not the things that bring you near Us closely; however, the one who believes and acts righteously (is close to Us). Therefore, such people will have the double reward for what they did, and they will be at peace in the upper chambers (of Paradise)"
  34,38,"As for those who strive against our signs trying to frustrate (them), they will be arraigned into the torment"
  34,39,"Say, . Surely, my Lord extends provision for whomsoever He wills, and straitens (it) for him. And whatever thing you spend, He replaces it, and He is the best of the sustainers"
