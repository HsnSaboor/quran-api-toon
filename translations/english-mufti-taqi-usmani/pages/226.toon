quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  11,38,"He started making the Ark. Whenever the leaders of his people passed by him, they mocked at him. He said, .If you mock at us, we mock at you like you mock at us"
  11,39,"So, you shall soon know who will be visited by a scourge that will humiliate him, and upon whom a lasting punishment will settle forever"
  11,40,"At last, when Our command came and the oven overflowed, We said, .Take into the Ark a pair of two from every species, along with your family,__except those against whom the Word has already been pronounced__and (also take into it) those who have believed. And there were only a few who had believed with him"
  11,41,"He (NuH) said, .Embark it. With the name of Allah it sails and anchors. Surely, my Lord is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful"
  11,42,"And it was sailing with them amidst the waves like mountains. And NuH called out to his son, who was at an isolated place, .O my child, come on board with us, and do not be in the company of the disbelievers"
  11,43,"He said, .I shall take shelter on a mountain which will save me from the water. He said, .There is no saver today from the command of Allah, except the one to whom He shows mercy. And the waves rose high between the two, and he was among those who were drowned"
  11,44,"It was said (by Allah), .O earth, suck in your water, and O heaven, stop. And water subsided, and the matter was over. It (the Ark) came to rest on the Judi, and it was said, .Away with the wrongdoers"
  11,45,"NuH called unto his Lord and said, .My Lord, my son is a part of my family, and surely Your promise is true, and You are the greatest of all judges"
