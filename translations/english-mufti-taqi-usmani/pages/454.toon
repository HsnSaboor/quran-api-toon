quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  38,17,"Bear patiently with what they say, and remember Our servant Dawud, the man of might. Surely he was ever-turning to Allah"
  38,18,We had subjugated the mountains to join him (in) making tasbiH (i.e. pronouncing Allah‘s purity) at evening and sunrise
  38,19,"and the birds as well, mustered together. All were turning to Allah with him"
  38,20,"And We made his kingdom strong, and gave him wisdom and decisive speech"
  38,21,"Has there come to you the story of the litigants, when they entered the sanctuary by climbing over the wall"
  38,22,"When they entered upon Dawud, and he was scared of them, they said, .Be not scared. We are two litigants; one of us has wronged the other, so decide between us with truth, and do not cross the limits, and guide us to the right path"
  38,23,"This is my brother; he has ninety nine ewes, and I have a single ewe; still he said, ‘Give it into my charge.‘ And he overpowered me in speech"
  38,24,"He (Dawud) said, .He has certainly wronged you by demanding your ewe to be added to his ewe. Many partners oppress one another, except those who believe and do righteous deeds, and very few they are. And Dawud realized that We had put him to a test, so he prayed to his Lord for forgiveness, and bowing down, he fell in prostration, and turned (to Allah)"
  38,25,"So we forgave him that (lapse), and surely he has a place of nearness in Our presence, and an excellent resort"
  38,26,"O Dawud, We have made you a vicegerent on earth, so judge between people with truth, and do not follow the selfish desire, lest it should lead you astray from Allah‘s path. Surely those who go astray from Allah‘s path will have a severe punishment, because they had forgotten the Day of Reckoning"
