They will say, .Had Allah guided us, we would have guided you. It is all the same for us whether we deplore or endure, we have no way out"
  14,22,"The Satan will say when the matter will have been decided, .Allah promised you a truthful promise while I gave you a promise and did not fulfill it. I had no authority over you, except that I invited you and you accepted my call. So, do not blame me, but blame yourselves. Neither I can come to your help, nor can you come to my help. I disown your associating me with Allah in the past. Surely, there is a painful punishment for the unjust"
