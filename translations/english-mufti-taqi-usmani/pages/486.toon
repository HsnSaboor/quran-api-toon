quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  42,23,"That is the good news that Allah gives to His servants who believed and did righteous deeds. Say, .I do not ask you any fee for it, except the love of kinship. And whoever performs a good act, We will increase for him goodness therein. Surely Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Appreciative"
  42,24,"Is it that they say, .He has forged a lie against Allah.? So, if Allah wills, He may put a seal on your heart. And Allah blots out falsehood and establishes truth with His words. Surely, He is fully aware of what lies in the hearts"
  42,25,And He is the One who accepts repentance from His servants and forgives evil deeds and knows whatever you do
  42,26,"And He responds to (the prayer of) those who believe and do righteous deeds, and gives them more out of His grace. As for the disbelievers, for them there is a severe punishment"
  42,27,"Should Allah expand the provision for His servants (to its full extent), they would spread mischief on earth; but He sends down what He wills in (due) measure. Surely, with regard to His slaves, He is All-Aware, Ever-Watchful"
  42,28,"And He is the One who sends down rain after they have lost hope, and He extends His mercy. And He is the Guardian, Worthy of all praise"
  42,29,Among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the creatures He has spread in them. He is Powerful to assemble them whenever He so wills
  42,30,"Whatever hardship befalls you is because of what your own hands have committed, while He overlooks many (of your faults)"
  42,31,"You are not able to frustrate (Him) in the earth. And, besides Allah, you have neither someone to protect, nor someone to help"
