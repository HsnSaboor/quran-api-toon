quran[19]{c,v,t}:
  19,77,"Have you, then, seen him who rejected Our verses and said, .I shall certainly be given wealth and children"
  19,78,Has he peeped into the Unseen or taken a covenant with the All-Merciful (Allah)
  19,79,Never! We will write what he says and extend for him the punishment extensively
  19,80,"And We will inherit from him what he is talking about, and he will come to Us all alone"
  19,81,"They have taken gods other than Allah, so that they may be a source of might for them"
  19,82,"Never! They (their fabricated deities) will soon reject their having worshipped them, and they will be just the opposite for them"
  19,83,Have you not seen that We have sent the devils onto the disbelievers inciting them with all their incitements
  19,84,So make no hurry about them; We are but counting for them a count down
  19,85,The day We will assemble the God-fearing before the All-Merciful (Allah) as guests
  19,86,and will drive the sinners towards the Jahannam as herds of cattle (are driven) towards water
  19,87,"none will have power to intercede, except the one who has entered into a covenant with the All-Merciful (Allah)"
  19,88,"They say, .The All-Merciful (Allah) has got a son"
  19,89,Indeed you have come up with such an abominable statement
  19,90,"that the heavens are well-nigh to explode at it, and the earth to burst apart, and the mountains to fall down crumbling"
  19,91,for they have ascribed a son to the All-Merciful (Allah)
  19,92,while it does not behove the All-Merciful to have a son
  19,93,"There is none in the heavens and the earth, but bound to come to the All-Merciful as a salve"
  19,94,He has fully encompassed them and precisely calculated their numbers
  19,95,"and each one of them is bound to come to Him on the Day of Judgment, all alone"
