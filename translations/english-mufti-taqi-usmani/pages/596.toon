quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  92,15,None will enter it but the wretched one
  92,16,who rejected (the truth) and turned away (from it)
  92,17,And saved from it will be the most God-fearing one
  92,18,who gives his wealth (in charity) to become purified
  92,19,while no one has conferred any favour on him for which he would give a return
  92,20,"but (he gave his wealth in charity) only to seek the Countenance of his Lord, the Most High"
  92,21,And surely he will soon be happy
  93,1,I swear by the forenoon
  93,2,and by the night when it becomes peaceful
  93,3,"your Lord (O Prophet,) has neither forsaken you, nor has become displeased"
  93,4,Surely the Hereafter is much better for you than the present life
  93,5,"And of course, your Lord will give you so much that you will be pleased"
  93,6,"Did He not find you an orphan, and give you shelter"
  93,7,"And He found you unaware of the way (the Shari‘ah ), then He guided you"
  93,8,"and He found you in need, then made you need-free"
  93,9,"Therefore, as for orphan, do not oppress him"
  93,10,"and as for the beggar, do not scold him"
  93,11,"And about the bounty of your Lord, do talk"
  94,1,Have We not caused your bosom to be wide open for you
  94,2,And We removed from you your burden
  94,3,that had (almost) broken your back
  94,4,and We raised high your name
  94,5,"So, undoubtedly, along with the hardship there is ease"
  94,6,"Undoubtedly, along with the hardship there is ease"
  94,7,"So, when you are free (from collective services), toil hard (in worship)"
  94,8,and towards your Lord turn with eagerness
