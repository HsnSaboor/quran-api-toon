quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  10,15,"When Our verses are recited to them in all their clarity, say those who do not believe in meeting Us, .Bring a Qur‘an other than this, or make changes in it (to suit our fancies). Say, .It is not possible for me to make changes in it on my own. I follow nothing but what is revealed to me. If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a terrible day"
  10,16,"Say, .Had Allah so willed, I would have not recited it to you, nor would He have let you know it. Then, I have lived among you for years before it. Have you, then, no sense"
  10,17,"So, who is more unjust than the one who forges a lie against Allah or gives the lie to His signs? Indeed (such) guilty people shall not achieve success"
  10,18,"Beside Allah, they worship those who can neither harm nor benefit them, and they say, .These are our intercessors with Allah. Say, .Are you informing Allah of what He does not know as existing in the heavens or on the earth?. Pure is He, and far higher than what they associate with Him"
  10,19,"All the people were no more than a single community; later, they differed. But for a word from your Lord that had already come to pass, a decisive judgment would have been made about their mutual differences"
  10,20,"And they say, .Why is it that no sign has been sent down to him from his Lord?. Say, .The Unseen is only for Allah. So, wait. I am waiting with you"
