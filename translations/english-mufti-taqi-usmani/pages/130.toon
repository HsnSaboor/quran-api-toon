quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  6,19,"Say, .Whose testimony is the greatest?. Say, .Allah is the witness between me and you, and this Qur‘an has been revealed to me so that I should thereby warn you, and whomsoever it may reach. Do you really bear witness that there are other gods along with Allah?. Say, .I bear no such witness. Say, .In fact, He is one God. I disown what you associate (with Him)"
  6,20,"Those to whom We have given the Book recognize him (the Messenger) as (certainly as) they would recognize their sons. Those who have brought loss to themselves, they are not going to believe"
  6,21,"Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His signs? Beware, the unjust shall not prosper"
  6,22,"(Be mindful of) the Day We shall gather them together, then We will say to those who associated partners with Allah, .Where are those you claimed to be partners of Allah"
  6,23,"Then, they will have no other mischievous move but that they will say, .By Allah, our Lord, we ascribed no partners to Allah"
  6,24,"See how they will lie about themselves, and all that they used to forge will vanish from them"
  6,25,"There are those among them who (apparently) listen to you, but We have put coverings on their hearts, so that they do not understand, and heaviness in their ears. If they were to see all the signs, they would still not believe in them, so much so that, when they come to quarrel with you, the disbelievers say (of the Qur‘an), .It is nothing but tales of the ancients"
  6,26,"From it (the Qur‘an) they prevent others, and from it they keep themselves away. They ruin none but their own selves, while they do not realize it"
  6,27,"If only you could (be there to) see when they will be made to stand by the Fire, and they will say, .Would that we were sent back, then we would not reject the signs of our Lord, and would join the believers"
