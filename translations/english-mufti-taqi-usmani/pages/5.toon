quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,25,"And give good news to those who believe and do righteous deeds that for them there are gardens beneath which rivers flow. Every time they are given a fruit from there to eat, they will say, .This is what we have been given before.; and they will be given (fruits) resembling one another. And for them there shall be wives purified; and there they will live forever"
  2,26,"Indeed, Allah does not feel shy in citing any parable, be it that of a gnat or of something above it (in meanness). Now, as for those who believe, they know it is the truth from their Lord; while those who disbelieve say, .What could Allah have meant by this parable?. By this He lets many go astray, and by this He makes many find guidance. But He does not let anyone go astray thereby except those who are sinful"
  2,27,"— those who break the Covenant of Allah after it has been made binding, and cut off the relations Allah has commanded to be joined, and spread disorder on the earth - it is these who are the losers"
  2,28,"How is it that you deny Allah, while you were lifeless and He gave you life; then He will make you die, and then He will make you live again, and then to Him you will be returned"
  2,29,It is He who created for you all that the earth contains; then He turned to the heavens and made them seven skies — and He is the knower of all things
