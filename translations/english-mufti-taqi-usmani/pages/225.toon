quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  11,29,"And, O my people, I do not demand from you any wealth for it. My reward is with none but Allah. And I am not the one who could drive the believers away. Surely, they will be meeting their Lord (gracefully), but I do see your behavior is that of ignorance"
  11,30,"O my people, who would help me against (the punishment of) Allah, if I were to drive them away? Would you still take no lesson"
  11,31,"And I do not say to you that I have the treasures of Allah, nor that I have the knowledge of the unseen, nor do I say that I am an angel. Nor do I say (as you do) about those who are contemptible in your eyes that Allah will never award them any good; Allah knows best what lies in their hearts. (If I were to say so,) then, I would indeed be one of the unjust"
  11,32,"They said, .O NuH, you have debated with us, and debated too much. Now bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are one of the truthful"
  11,33,"He said, .Only Allah will bring it to you, if He so wills, and you cannot frustrate (His will)"
  11,34,"My good counsel will not profit you, even though I wish you the best, if Allah wills to let you go astray. He is your Lord, and to Him you shall be made to return"
  11,35,"Do they (the pagans of Makkah) still say that he (Muhammad) has forged it? Say, .If I have forged it, then, I am responsible for my sin, and I am free of the sins you commit"
  11,36,"And it was revealed to NuH: None of your people would come to believe any more, except those who have already believed. So, be not distressed by what they have been doing"
  11,37,"And make an ark under Our eyes and according to Our revelation; and do not speak to Me about those who have crossed the limits, as they are destined to be drowned"
