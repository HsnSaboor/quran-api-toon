quran[42]{c,v,t}:
  80,1,He (the Prophet) frowned and turned his face
  80,2,because the blind man came to him
  80,3,"What could tell you (O prophet about the prospects of the blind man?) May be, (if you had attended him properly,) he would have attained purity"
  80,4,"or have received the advice, and the advice would have benefited him"
  80,5,As for the one who does not care (about faith)
  80,6,you are anxious to pursue him
  80,7,"while there is no blame on you, if he does not attain purity"
  80,8,As regards the one who has come to you rushing eagerly
  80,9,while he fears (Allah)
  80,10,to him you pay no heed
  80,11,"Never! (you should never act in this way,) Indeed this (Qur‘an) is an advice"
  80,12,"So, whoever so wills may pay heed to it"
  80,13,It is (recorded) in those scripts (of the Preserved Tablet) that are honoured
  80,14,"exalted, purified"
  80,15,in the hands of those scribes
  80,16,"who are honorable, righteous"
  80,17,Damned is the man! How ungrateful he is
  80,18,From which stuff did He (Allah) create him
  80,19,"from a drop of semen! He created him, and designed him in due proportion"
  80,20,then He made the way easy for him
  80,21,"Later, he made him die, and put him into grave"
  80,22,"Thereafter, when He will intend, He will raise him up"
  80,23,No! He has not yet fulfilled what He (Allah) had commanded him
  80,24,"So, the man should consider his food"
  80,25,how well We poured water
  80,26,then how nicely We split the earth
  80,27,then We grew in it grain
  80,28,and grapes and greens
  80,29,and olive and date-palms
  80,30,"and gardens, full of thick trees"
  80,31,and fruits and fodder
  80,32,as a benefit for you and your cattle
  80,33,So when the Deafening Noise will occur
  80,34,the Day when one will flee from his brother
  80,35,and from his mother and father
  80,36,and from his wife and sons
  80,37,every one of them will be too engaged in his own affairs to care for others
  80,38,"Many faces, on that day, will be bright"
  80,39,"laughing, rejoicing"
  80,40,"and many faces, on that day, will be stained with dust"
  80,41,covered by darkness
  80,42,"Those are the disbelievers, the nefarious"
