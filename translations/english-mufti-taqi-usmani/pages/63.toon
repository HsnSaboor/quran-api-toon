  3,101,"How could you disbelieve while you are the ones to whom the verses of Allah are recited, and present amidst you is His Messenger? Whoever holds on to Allah, is surely led to the straight path"
  3,102,"O you who believe, fear Allah, as He should be feared, and let not yourself die save as Muslims"
  3,103,"Hold fast, all of you, to the cord of Allah, and be not divided. Remember the blessing of Allah upon you: When you were enemies to each other, and He brought your hearts together, so that, you became brothers through His blessing. You were at the brink of a pit of Fire, then He saved you from it. This is how Allah makes His signs clear to you, so that you may take the right path"
  3,104,"There has to be a group of people from among you who call towards the good, and bid the Fair and forbid the Unfair. And it is these who are successful"

  3,108,These are the verses of Allah We recite to you with all veracity. Allah does not intend to do injustice to (anyone in) the worlds
