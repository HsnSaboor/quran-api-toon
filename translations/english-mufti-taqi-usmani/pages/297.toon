quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,28,"Keep yourself content with those who call their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure, and let not your eyes overlook them, seeking the splendor of the worldly life. And do not obey the one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, and who has followed his desire and whose behavior has exceeded the limits"
  18,29,"And say, .The truth is from your Lord. Now, whoever so wills may believe and whoever so wills may deny. Surely, We have prepared for the unjust a fire, whose tent will envelop them. And if they will beg for help, they shall be helped with water like oily dregs that will scald the faces. Vile is the drink, and evil is the Fire as a resting-place"
  18,30,"As for those who believe and do righteous deeds,__of course, We do not waste the reward of those who are good in deeds"
  18,31,"Those are the ones for whom there are eternal gardens, rivers flowing beneath them. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, and they will be dressed in green garments, made of fine silk and thick silk, reclining therein on couches. Excellent is the reward and beautiful is the Paradise as a resting-place"
  18,32,"Give them an example. There were two men; We gave one of them two gardens of grapes, and surrounded both of them with date-palms, and placed vegetation between them"
  18,33,"Both the gardens brought forth their fruit, and suppressed nothing from it, and We caused a stream to flow through them"
  18,34,"And he had wealth. So, he said to his companion while conversing with him, .I am greater than you in wealth and stronger in manpower"
