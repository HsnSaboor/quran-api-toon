quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  6,53,"Thus We have tested some of them through others, so that they should say, .Are these the ones among all of us whom Allah has chosen for His favour?. Yes, does Allah not know well who are the grateful"
  6,54,"When those who believe in Our verses come to you, say to them, .Peace on you. Your Lord has prescribed for Himself mercy, so that if any one of you does an evil deed out of ignorance and thereafter repents and mends his ways, then (you will see that) He is Most-Forgiving, Very- Merciful"
  6,55,"This is how We explain the verses in detail, so that the way of the guilty may become exposed"
  6,56,"Say, .I have been forbidden from worshiping those whom you invoke beside Allah. Say, .I do not follow your desires, because if I were to do that, I would be going astray and would no more be of those on the right path"
  6,57,"Say, .I am on clear guidance from my Lord, and you have cried lies to it. That which you demand to be hastened is not up to me. The Decision belongs to none but Allah. He relates the Truth and He is the best of all judges"
  6,58,"Say, .If what you demand to be hastened were up to me, the matter between me and you would have been over. Allah well knows who the wrongdoers are"
  6,59,"With Him are the keys of the Unseen. No one knows them but He. He knows what is in the land and the sea. No leaf ever falls but that He knows about it, and there is no grain in the dark layers of the earth, or anything fresh or dry that is not recorded in a manifest book"
