quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  47,1,"Those who disbelieved, and prevented (others) from Allah‘s way, He (Allah) has rendered their deeds vain"
  47,2,"And those who believed and did righteous deeds and believed in that which is revealed to MuHammad,_and it is the truth (that has come) from their Lord__He will write off their evil deeds, and will set aright their state of affairs"
  47,3,"That is because the disbelievers have followed falsehood, while the believers have followed the truth (that has come) from their Lord. This is how Allah explains their (respective) situations to the people"
  47,4,"So, when you encounter those who disbelieve, then (aim at) smiting the necks, until when you have broken their strength thoroughly, then tie fast the bond, (by making them captives). Then choose (to release them) either (as) a favour (shown to them,), or (after receiving) ransom, until the war throws down its load of arms. That (is Our command.) If Allah willed, He would have (Himself) subjected them to retribution, but (Allah ordered you to fight,) so that He may test some of you through some others. And those who are killed in Allah‘s way, He will never let their deeds go to waste"
  47,5,"(Instead,) He will guide them, and will set aright their state of affairs"
  47,6,and will admit them to the Paradise He has identified for them
  47,7,"O you who believe, if you will help (the religion prescribed by) Allah, He will help you, and will stabilize your footings"
  47,8,"As for those who disbelieve, (destined) for them is destruction, and He has rendered their deeds vain"
  47,9,That is because they hate what Allah has sent down; therefore Allah has nullified their deeds
  47,10,Have they not travelled in the land so that they might see how was the end of those before them? Allah brought utter destruction to them. And (ready) for (these) disbelievers are the likes thereof
  47,11,"That is because Allah is the supporter of those who believe. As for the disbelievers, there is no supporter for them"
