quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,26,"For those who do good there is the best, and something more. Neither gloom shall cover their faces, nor disgrace. Those are the people of Paradise. Therein they shall live forever"
  10,27,"As for those who commit evils, the recompense of each evil shall be similar to that evil, and disgrace shall cover them. For them, there is none to save from Allah. Their faces will seem to be covered with layers of a dark night. Those are the people of the Fire. Therein they shall live forever"
  10,28,"And (be mindful of) the Day when We shall gather them together, then We shall say to those who associated partners with Allah, .Wait in your place, you and your associate-gods. Then We will cause a split between them, and their associate-gods will say, .It was not us that you worshipped"
  10,29,"So, Allah is enough as witness between us and between you. We were totally unaware of your worship"
  10,30,"Thereupon, everyone shall assess what one had sent ahead, and they will be sent back to Allah, their true Lord, and whatever they used to fabricate will vanish from them"
  10,31,"Say, .Who gives you sustenance from the heavens and the earth? Or, who controls the (powers of) hearing and seeing? And who brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the living? And who manages everything?. They will say, .Allah. Then, (you) say, .Would you not, then, fear Allah (by desisting from holding others as gods)"
  10,32,"So, that is Allah, your Lord in truth. And what is there after truth but error? To where, then, are you being diverted (by your whims)"
  10,33,This is how the Word of your Lord has come true about the sinners that they will not believe
