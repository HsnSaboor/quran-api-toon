quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  29,64,"This worldly life is nothing but an amusement and play, and the Last Abode is the real life indeed. Only if they know"
  29,65,"So when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allah, having their faith purely in Him. But when He saves them (and brings them) to the land, in no time they start committing shirk (ascribing partners to Allah)"
  29,66,"thus becoming ungrateful for what We gave to them. Let them have some enjoyment, then they will soon come to know (the ill-fate of their attitude)"
  29,67,Did they not see that We have made a peaceful sanctuary (Haram ) while (other) people around them are being snatched away? Do they still believe in falsity and reject Allah‘s grace
  29,68,Who is more unjust than the one who forges a lie against Allah or rejects the truth when it comes to him? Is there not in Jahannam a home for disbelievers
  29,69,"As for those who strive in Our way, We will certainly take them onto Our paths, and indeed Allah is with those who are good in deeds"

  30,5,"with Allah‘s help. He helps whomsoever He wills. And He is the Mighty, the Very-Merciful"
