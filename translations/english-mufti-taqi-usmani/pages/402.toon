quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  29,46,"Do not debate with the people of the Book unless it is in the best manner, except with those of them who commit injustice. And say, .We believe in what is sent down to us and sent down to you, and our God and your God is One, and to Him we submit (ourselves)"
  29,47,"Thus We have sent down the Book to you. So those to whom We have given the Book believe in it. And from these (the people of Makkah) there are ones who believe in it, and no one rejects Our verses except the infidels"
  29,48,"You (O Prophet,) have never been reciting any book before this, nor have you been writing it with your right hand; had it been so, the adherents of falsehood would have raised doubts"
  29,49,But it (the Qur‘an in itself) is (a package of) evident signs in the hearts of those who are given knowledge. And no one rejects our verses except the wrongdoers
  29,50,"And they say, .Why is it that no signs (miracles) have been sent down to him from his Lord?. Say, .Signs are only with Allah, and I am only a plain warner"
  29,51,Is it not sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book that is being recited to them? Surely in it there is mercy and advice for a people who believe
  29,52,"Say, .Allah is enough as a witness between me and you. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. And those who believe in falsity and do not believe in Allah,__those are the losers"
