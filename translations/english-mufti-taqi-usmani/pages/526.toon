quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  53,1,By the star when it goes down to set
  53,2,"your fellow (the Holy Prophet) has neither missed the way, nor did he deviate"
  53,3,He does not speak out of (his own) desire
  53,4,It is but revelation revealed (to him)
  53,5,It is taught to him by one (angel) of strong faculties
  53,6,the one of vigour. So he stood poised
  53,7,while he was on the upper horizon
  53,8,"Then he drew near, and came down"
  53,9,"so as he was at a distance like that of two bows (joined together), rather even nearer"
  53,10,Thus He (Allah) revealed to His slave what He revealed
  53,11,The heart did not err in what he saw
  53,12,Do you quarrel with him in what he sees
  53,13,Indeed he saw him another time
  53,14,by Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (the lote-tree in the upper realm)
  53,15,near which there is Jannat-ul-Ma‘wa (the Paradise of Abode)
  53,16,when the lote-tree was covered by that which covered it
  53,17,"The eye neither went wrong, nor did exceed the limit"
  53,18,He has indeed seen a part of the biggest signs of your Lord
  53,19,Have you ever considered about the (idols of) Lat and ‘Uzza
  53,20,"and about the other, the third (idol), namely, Manat"
  53,21,Is it that you have males and He (Allah) has females
  53,22,"If so, it is a bizarre division"
  53,23,"These are nothing but names you and your fathers have invented; Allah has sent down no authority attached to them. They are following nothing but conjecture and what their own souls desire, while guidance from their Lord has surely reached them"
  53,24,Is it that man can get whatever he wishes
  53,25,"(No,) because to Allah alone belongs the (good of) the Hereafter and the former life (of this world)"
  53,26,"How many angels there are in the heavens whose intercession cannot benefit (any one) at all, but after Allah allows (it) for whomsoever He wills and pleases"
