  3,2,"Allah: There is no god but He, the Alive, the All-Sustaining"
  3,3,"He has revealed to you the Book with the truth, confirming what has been before it, and has sent down the Torah and the Injil"

  3,5,"Surely, Allah is such that nothing is hidden from Him, neither in the earth nor in the sky"
  3,6,"He is the One Who shapes you in the wombs as He likes. There is no god but He, the Mighty, the Wise"
  3,7,"He is the One who has revealed to you the Book (the Qur‘an).

Only the men of understanding observe the advice"
  3,8,"Our Lord, do not let our hearts deviate from the right path after You have given us guidance, and bestow upon us mercy from Your own. Surely, You, and You alone, are the One who bestows in abundance"
  3,9,"Our Lord, You are going to assemble all the people on a day in (the occurrence of) which there is no doubt. Verily, Allah does not back out of His promise"
