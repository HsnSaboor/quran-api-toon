quran[4]{c,v,t}:
  4,20,"If you want to take a wife in place of the one (you have), and you have given her plenty of wealth, then do not take any of it back. Would you take it through imputation and open sin"
  4,21,How can you take it when you have had access to each other and they have taken a firm covenant from you
  4,22,"Do not marry those women whom your fathers had married except what has passed. It is indeed shameful and detestable, and it is an evil practice"
  4,23,"Prohibited for you are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal aunts, your maternal aunts, daughters of brother, daughters of sister, your mothers who suckled you, your sisters through suckling, mothers of your wives and your step-daughters under your care who are born of your women with whom you have had intercourse,_though if you have not had intercourse with them, there is no sin on you,_and the wives of your sons from your loins, and that you combine two sisters (in wedlock), except what has passed. Surely, Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful"
