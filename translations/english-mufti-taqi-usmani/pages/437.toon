quran[12]{c,v,t}:
  35,19,The blind and the sighted are not equal
  35,20,nor are darkness and light
  35,21,nor shade and heat of the sun
  35,22,And the living and the dead are not alike. Allah makes to hear whomsoever He wills. And you cannot make to hear those who are in the graves
  35,23,You are but a warner
  35,24,"Surely We have sent you with truth as a bearer of good news and as a warner, and there was no community without a warner having passed among them"
  35,25,"If they reject you, (it is not something new, because) those before them have (also) rejected (messengers). Their messengers came to them with clear proofs and with scriptures and with the enlightening book"
  35,26,"Then I seized those who disbelieved. So, how was My censure"
  35,27,"Did you not see that Allah has sent down water from the sky? Then We brought forth with it fruits having different colours. And among the mountains there are tracks, white and red— of different colours, and ( others) utterly black"
  35,28,"And among humans and beasts and cattle, there are those having different colours as well. Only those of His slaves fear Allah who are knowledgeable. Surely Allah is Mighty, Forgiving"
  35,29,"Surely those who recite Allah‘s Book and have established Salah and have spent, secretly and openly, from what We have provided to them –— they hope for a trade that will never crash"
  35,30,"so that He pays them their rewards in full, and gives them more out of His grace. Surely He is Most-Forgiving, Very-Appreciative"
