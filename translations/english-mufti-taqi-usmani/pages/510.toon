quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  47,30,"Had We willed, We would have shown them to you (by identifying each one of them,) so as you would definitely recognize them by their features. However, you will recognize them by the tone of (their) speech. And Allah knows (all) your deeds"
  47,31,"And We will certainly test you until We know those of you who carry out Jihad (struggle in Allah‘s way) and observe patience, and until We check your episodes"
  47,32,"Those who disbelieve and prevent (others) from Allah‘s way, and oppose the Messenger, after the Guidance has appeared to them clearly, shall never bring harm to Allah in the least, and He will render their deeds vain"
  47,33,"O you who believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and do not nullify your deeds"
  47,34,"Those who disbelieved and prevented (others) from Allah‘s way, then died as disbelievers, Allah will never forgive them"
  47,35,"So, do not lose heart, and do not appeal for peace; you will be the uppermost, and Allah is with you; and He will never deprive you of your deeds"
  47,36,"The worldly life is but play and pastime. If you believe and be God-fearing, He will give you your rewards, and will not ask you your riches"
  47,37,"If He were to ask you of it, and press you (to spend all your wealth), you would show miserliness, and He would expose your disgusts"
  47,38,"Yes, you are such that you are called upon to spend in Allah‘s way, but some of you withhold in miserliness_ and he who withholds in miserliness withholds against himself_ and Allah is the Need-Free, and you are the needy. And if you turn away, He will replace you by some other people, then they will not be like you"
