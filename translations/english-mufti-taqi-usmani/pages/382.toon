quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  27,56,"So, the answer of his people was not else but that they said, .Expel the family of LuT from your town. They are a people who over-indulge in purity"
  27,57,"So, We saved him and his family, except his wife. We destined her to remain among those who stayed behind"
  27,58,And We rained on them a rain. So evil was the rain of those who were warned
  27,59,"Say, .Praise belongs to Allah, and peace be on those of His servants whom He has chosen. Is Allah better or that which they associate (with Him as His partners)"
  27,60,"Or the One who created the heavens and the earth and sent down for you water from the sky? Then We caused to grow with it gardens, full of glamour. It was not within your ability to grow their trees. Is there any god along with Allah? No, but they are a people who equate (others with Allah)"
  27,61,"Or the One who made the earth a place to settle and made rivers amidst it and made mountains for (making) it (firm), and made a barrier between two seas? Is there any god along with Allah? No, but most of them do not have knowledge"
  27,62,"Or the One who responds to a helpless person when He prays to Him and removes distress, and who makes you vicegerents of the earth? Is there any god along with Allah? No, but little you heed to advice"
  27,63,"Or the One who guides you in depths of darkness on land and sea, and who sends the winds bearing good news before His mercy? Is there any god along with Allah? Allah is far higher than the partners they ascribe to Him"
