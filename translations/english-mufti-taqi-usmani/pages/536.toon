quran[26]{c,v,t}:
  56,51,"Then O you, the erring, the denying people"
  56,52,you will have to eat from the tree of zaqqum
  56,53,and to fill with it the bellies
  56,54,then on top of it you will have to drink boiling water
  56,55,and to drink like camels suffering from the disease of over-thirst
  56,56,This will be their welcome entertainment on the Day of Requital
  56,57,We have created you; then why do you not believe in it
  56,58,"So, tell Me about the semen you drop (in the wombs)"
  56,59,"Is it you who create it, or are We the Creator"
  56,60,"We have appointed (the times of) death among you, and We cannot be frustrated"
  56,61,"from replacing you with others like you, and creating you (afresh) in that (form) which you do not know"
  56,62,And you certainly know the first creation; then why do you not take lesson
  56,63,"Well, tell Me about that (seed) which you sow"
  56,64,"Is it you who grow it, or are We the One who grows"
  56,65,"If We so will, We can certainly make it crumbled, and you will remain wondering"
  56,66,"(and saying,) .We are laden with debt"
  56,67,rather we are totally deprived
  56,68,"Again, tell Me about the water you drink"
  56,69,"Is it you who have brought it down from the clouds, or are We the One who sends (it) down"
  56,70,"If We so will, We can make it bitter in taste. So why do you not offer gratitude"
  56,71,Now tell Me about the fire you kindle
  56,72,"Is it you who have originated its tree, or are We the Originator"
  56,73,"We have made it a reminder (of Our infinite power, and of the fire of Hell) and a benefit for travelers in deserts"
  56,74,"So, proclaim purity of the name of your Lord, the Magnificent"
  56,75,"So, I swear by the setting places of the stars"
  56,76,"and indeed it is a great oath, if you are to appreciate"
