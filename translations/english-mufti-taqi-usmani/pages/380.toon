quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  27,36,"So when he (the envoy) came to Sulaiman, he said, .Are you extending a financial aid to me? So what Allah has given me is much better than what He has given to you. But you yourselves are proud of your gift"
  27,37,"Go back to them, and we will bring to them forces they have no power to face, and we will certainly drive them out from there in humiliation while they are disgraced"
  27,38,"He said, .O chieftains, which one of you will bring her throne to me before they come to me submissively"
  27,39,"A stalwart of the Jinn said, .I will bring it to you before you rise up from your place, and for this (task) I am powerful, reliable"
  27,40,"Said the one who had the knowledge of the book, .I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you. So when he saw it (the throne) well placed before him, he said, .This is by the grace of my Lord, so that He may test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful. Whoever is grateful is grateful for his own benefit, and whoever is ungrateful, then my Lord is Need-Free, Bountiful"
  27,41,"He said, .Disguise the throne for her, and we will see whether she discovers the truth, or she does not recognize it"
  27,42,"So when she came, it was said (to her), .Is your throne like this?. She said, .It seems to be the same. We have been made to recognize the truth even before this, and we have already submitted"
  27,43,And she was prevented (from submitting before this) by that which she used to worship instead of Allah. Indeed she was from a disbelieving people
  27,44,"It was said to her, .Enter the palace. Then once she saw it, she thought it was flowing water, and uncovered her legs. He (Sulaiman) said, .This is a palace made of glasses. She said, .My Lord, I had surely wronged myself, and now I submit, along with Sulaiman, to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds"
