quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,36,"It is not open for a believing man or a believing woman, once Allah and His messenger have decided a thing, that they should have a choice about their matter; and whoever disobeys Allah and His messenger, he indeed gets off the track, falling into an open error"
  33,37,"(Remember) when you (O Prophet,) were saying to the one who was favored by Allah and favored by you. Keep your wife to your self, and fear Allah. And you were concealing in your heart what Allah was going to reveal, and you were fearing people, while Allah is more entitled to be feared by you. So, when Zaid finished his desire for her, We gave her into your marriage, so that there may not be a problem for the believers in marrying wives of their adopted sons, when they finish their desire for them; and Allah‘s decree had to be enforced"
  33,38,"There is no problem for the prophet in (doing) what Allah has prescribed for him, a customary practice of Allah in the case of those who have gone before – and Allah‘s command is pre-determined by destiny –"
  33,39,"those who convey the messages of Allah and have awe of Him, and have no awe of anyone except Allah. Allah is sufficient to take account (of everyone)"
  33,40,"MuHammad is not a father of any of your men, but he is a messenger of Allah and the last of the prophets. And Allah has the Knowledge of every thing"
  33,41,"O you who believe, remember Allah abundantly"
  33,42,and proclaim His purity at morn and eve
  33,43,"He is such that He and His angels send blessings to you, so that He brings you out from all sorts of darkness into Light; and He is Very-Merciful to the believers"
