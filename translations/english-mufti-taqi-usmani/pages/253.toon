quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  13,29,"Those who believe and do good deeds, for them there is the bliss and a good place to return"
  13,30,"Thus We have sent you, amidst a community before which many communities have passed away, so that you may recite to them what We have revealed to you, while they disbelieve in Ar-RaHman (the All-Merciful Allah). Say, .He is my Lord. There is no god but He. In Him I place my trust, and to Him is my return"
  13,31,"And even if there were a Qur‘an wherewith the mountains could be moved, or the earth could be split apart, or wherewith the dead are spoken to, (they would not believe). In fact, every decision rests only with Allah. Are the believers not satisfied with the fact that, if Allah willed, He would have brought all the people to the right path? And the disbelievers are continually receiving affliction because of what they did, or it visits somewhere close to their homes, until Allah‘s promise will come to pass. Surely, Allah does not go back upon His promise"
  13,32,"Messengers have been mocked at before you, so I let the disbelievers go on for a while. Then I seized them. So, how was My punishment"
  13,33,"Is then He, who is watchful over everyone and over whatever he does, (equal to their false deities?) Still they have made partners with Allah. Say, .Give their names. Is it that you are informing Him of something on earth He does not know, or of just empty words?. But, their ill- designs have been made alluring for the disbelievers, and they have been barred from the Path. And for the one whom Allah deprives of guidance, there is no one to guide"
  13,34,"For them there is punishment in the worldly life, and indeed the punishment of the Hereafter is even harder, and for them there is none to save them from Allah"
