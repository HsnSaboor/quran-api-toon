quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  6,158,"They are waiting for nothing less than that the angels should come to them, or your Lord or some signs of your Lord should come. The day some signs of your Lord will come, the believing of a person shall be of no use to him who had never believed before, or had not earned some good through his faith. Say, .Wait. Of course, we are waiting"
  6,159,"Surely, those who have made divisions in their religion and turned into factions, you have nothing to do with them. Their case rests with Allah alone; then He will tell them what they have been doing"
  6,160,"Whoever comes with a good deed will receive ten times as much, and whoever comes with an evil deed will be requited with no more than the like of it, and they shall not be wronged"
  6,161,"Say, .As for me, my Lord has guided me to a straight path, the straight religion, the faith of Ibrahim who was upright and was not of those who associate partners with Allah"
  6,162,"Say, .My prayer, my offering, my life and my death are for Allah, the Lord of all the worlds"
  6,163,"For Him there is no partner. And thus I have been commanded, and I am the first one to submit"
  6,164,"Say, .Should I seek a lord other than Allah while He is the Lord of everything? And nobody does anything but to his own account, and no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return. Then He will let you know what you were disputing about"
  6,165,"It is He who made you the vicegerents of the earth and raised some of you in ranks over others, so that He may test you in what He has given you. Surely, your Lord is swift in punishing, and surely He is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful"
