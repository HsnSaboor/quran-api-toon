quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  91,1,I swear by the sun and his broad light
  91,2,and by the moon when she follows him
  91,3,and by the day when it shows his brightness
  91,4,and by the night when it envelops him
  91,5,"and by the sky, and the One who built it"
  91,6,"and by the earth, and the One who spread it"
  91,7,"and by the soul, and the One who made it well"
  91,8,then inspired it with its (instincts of) evil and piety
  91,9,success is really attained by him who purifies it
  91,10,and failure is really suffered by him who pollutes it
  91,11,(The People of) Thamud denied the truth because of their transgression
  91,12,when rose up the one who was most wretched of them
  91,13,"So, the Messenger of Allah said to them, .Be careful of Allah‘s she-camel and her right to drink"
  91,14,"But they rejected him and killed her, so their Lord sent eradicating torment upon them because of their sin, and made it equal for all"
  91,15,And He has no fear of its consequence
  92,1,I swear by the night when it covers (the sun)
  92,2,and by the day when it unveils itself
  92,3,and by the One who created the male and the female
  92,4,your efforts are diverse
  92,5,As for the one who gives (in charity) and fears Allah
  92,6,and believes in the best (religion)
  92,7,We will facilitate for him the way to extreme ease (i.e. the comforts of Paradise)
  92,8,But the one who is miser and deems himself self-sufficient
  92,9,and rejects the best (religion)
  92,10,We will facilitate for him the way to extreme distress
  92,11,And his wealth will not help him when he will fall down (into Hell)
  92,12,"Of course, it is undertaken by Us to guide"
  92,13,and in Our control is the Hereafter and the worldly life
  92,14,So I have warned you of a blazing fire
