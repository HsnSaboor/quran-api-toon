  26,61,"And when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of Musa said, .Surely we are overtaken"
  26,62,"He said, .Never! Indeed with me is my Lord. He will guide me"
  26,63,"So We revealed to Musa saying, .Strike the sea with your staff. So it was severed apart, and each part became like a big mountain"
  26,64,Then We brought others close to that place
  26,65,And We saved Musa and all those with him
  26,66,Then we drowned the others
  26,67,"Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers"
  26,68,"and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful"
