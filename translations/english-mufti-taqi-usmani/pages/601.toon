quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  103,1,(I swear) by the Time
  103,2,man is in a state of loss indeed
  103,3,"except those who believed and did righteous deeds, and exhorted each other to follow truth, and exhorted each other to observe patience"
  104,1,"Woe to every backbiter, derider"
  104,2,who accumulates wealth and counts it
  104,3,He thinks that his wealth has made him eternal
  104,4,Never! He will certainly be thrown into the Crushing Fire
  104,5,And what may let you know what the Crushing Fire is
  104,6,It is Allah‘s kindled fire
  104,7,that will peep into the hearts
  104,8,It will be closed on them
  104,9,in outstretched columns
  105,1,Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the People of the Elephant
  105,2,Has He not turned their plan into nullity
  105,3,And He sent upon them flying birds in flocks
  105,4,throwing upon them stones of baked clay
  105,5,and thus He turned them into an eaten-up chaff
