  22,52,"We did not send any messenger before you nor a prophet, but (he faced a situation that) when he recited (the revelation), the Satan cast (doubts in the hearts of his opponents) about what he recited. So, Allah nullifies what the Satan casts, then Allah makes His verses firm, and Allah is All- Knowing, All-Wise"
  22,53,"(All this is allowed to be done) so that He may make what Satan casts a trial for those in whose hearts there is a disease, and whose hearts are hard;__and surely the wrongdoers are in the utmost antagonism"

  22,55,"Those who disbelieve will remain in doubt about it (the Qur‘an) forever, until the Hour (of Judgment) comes upon them suddenly, or there comes to them the punishment of a barren day"
