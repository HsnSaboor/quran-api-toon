quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  33,44,"Their greeting, on the Day when they will meet Him, will be, .Salam . . And He has prepared for them a noble reward"
  33,45,"O prophet, We have sent you as a witness and as a bearer of good news and a warner"
  33,46,"and as the one who calls (people) towards Allah with His permission, and as a luminous lamp"
  33,47,So give good news to the believers that they are going to receive a huge bounty from Allah
  33,48,"and do not obey the infidels and the hypocrites, and just ignore any hurt (that afflicts you) from them, and place your trust in Allah. Allah is sufficient (for you) to take care of all matters"
  33,49,"O you who believe, when you marry the believing women, and then divorce them before you have touched them, then they have no obligation of any ‘iddah (waiting period) for you that you may count. So give them (due) benefits, and release them in a pleasant manner"
  33,50,"O prophet, We have made lawful for you all your wives whom you have given their dowers, and those (bondwomen) whom you own, out of the captives Allah has given to you as spoils of war, and daughters of your paternal uncle, and daughters of your paternal aunts, and daughters of your maternal uncle, and daughters of your maternal aunts, who have migrated with you, and a believing woman who offers herself for (marrying) the prophet without dower, if the prophet wishes to bring her into his marriage, these rules being exclusive for you, and not for the (rest of the) believers, — We know what We have prescribed for them in respect of their wives and the slave-girls they own — so that there should be no difficulty for you. Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful"
