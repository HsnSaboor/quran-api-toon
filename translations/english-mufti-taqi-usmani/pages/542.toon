quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  58,1,"Allah has heard the talk of the woman who was debating with you about her husband, and was complaining to Allah. Allah was hearing the conversation between both of you. Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
  58,2,"Those of you who declare Zihar against their wives, they are not their mothers. Their mothers are none else but those who gave birth to them. Undoubtedly they utter an evil word and a lie; and Allah is surely Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful"
  58,3,"Those who declare Zihar against their wives, then retract what they said, obligated on them is to free the neck (of a slave) before the two (spouses) touch one another. This is what you are advised, and Allah is well aware of what you do"
  58,4,But whoever does not find (a slave) has to fast for two consecutive months before the two (spouses) touch one another. Then the one who is not able to do so has to feed sixty indigent persons. This is (laid down) so that you believe in Allah and His Messenger. These are the limits set by Allah; and for the disbelievers there is a painful punishment
  58,5,"Surely those who oppose Allah and His Messenger shall be disgraced, just as those before them were disgraced. We have sent down clear verses, and for the disbelievers there is a humiliating punishment"
  58,6,"on the Day when Allah will resurrect them all together, and will tell them what they did; Allah has its full account, while they have forgotten it. Allah is witness to every thing"
