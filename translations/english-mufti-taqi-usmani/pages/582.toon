quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  78,1,About what are they asking each other
  78,2,About the Great Event
  78,3,in which they dispute
  78,4,Indeed they will soon know
  78,5,"Again, indeed they will soon know"
  78,6,Did We not make the earth a floor
  78,7,and the mountains bulwarks
  78,8,And We have created you in pairs
  78,9,and made your sleep a source of rest
  78,10,and made the night a covering
  78,11,and made the day a source of livelihood
  78,12,And We have built seven strong (skies)
  78,13,and created a luminous lamp (the sun)
  78,14,And We have sent down abundant water from the rain-laden clouds
  78,15,so that We bring out therewith grain and vegetation
  78,16,and thick gardens
  78,17,Surely the Day of Decision is an appointed time
  78,18,"a day when the trumpet will be blown, so you will come in multitudes"
  78,19,"and the sky will be opened, so it will become as gates"
  78,20,"and the mountains will be set in motion, so they will be as mirage"
  78,21,Surely Jahannam (the Hell) lurks in ambush
  78,22,(It is) abode for the rebellious people
  78,23,who will be abiding in it for ages
  78,24,"They will taste nothing cool in it, nor a drink"
  78,25,except boiling water and pus
  78,26,"this being a punishment, fully commensurate (with their deeds)"
  78,27,They did not expect (to face) accounting (of their deeds)
  78,28,and they rejected Our signs totally
  78,29,And everything (from their deeds) is thoroughly recorded by Us in writing
  78,30,So now taste! We will add nothing to you but torment
