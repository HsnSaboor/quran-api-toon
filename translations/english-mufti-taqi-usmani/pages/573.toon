  72,15,"As for the unjust, they have become firewood for Hell"
  72,16,"(And it is also revealed to me) that if they (the people of Makkah) had stood firm on the (right) way, We would have supplied water to them in abundance"
  72,17,"so that We test them thereby; and if one turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, He will thrust him into a severe torment"
  72,18,"and that masajid (mosques) belong to Allah; so, do not invoke anyone along with Allah"
  72,19,"and that when Allah‘s servant stood invoking Him, they almost rushed on him in crowds"
  72,20,"Say, .I invoke my Lord, and do not associate anyone with Him"

  72,26,(He is the) Knower of the Unseen. So He does not let anyone know the Unseen created by Him

  72,28,"so that He knows that they (angels) have conveyed the messages of their Lord. And He has encompassed all that is with them, and has comprehensive knowledge of every thing by numbers"
