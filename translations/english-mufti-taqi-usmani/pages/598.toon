  97,1,We have sent it (the Qur‘an) down in the Night of Qadr
  97,2,And what may let you know what the Night of Qadr is
  97,3,The Night of Qadr is much better than one thousand months
  97,4,"The angels and the Spirit descend in it, with the leave of your Lord, along with every command"
  97,5,Peace it is till the debut of dawn
  98,1,Those who disbelieved from among the People of the Book and the polytheists were not (expected) to desist (from their wrong beliefs) unless there comes to them a clear proof
  98,2,a messenger from Allah who recites the purified scrolls
  98,3,containing (right and) straight writings
  98,4,And those who were given the Book did not disagree but after the clear proof came to them
  98,5,"while they were not ordered but to worship Allah, making their submission exclusive for him with no deviation, and to establish Salah and pay Zakah . That is the way of the straight religion"
  98,6,"Surely those who disbelieved from among the People of the Book and the polytheists will be in the fire of Jahannam , in which they will be living forever. Those are the worst of all human beings"
  98,7,"As for those who believed and did righteous deeds, they are the best of all human beings"
