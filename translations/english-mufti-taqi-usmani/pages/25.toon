quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,164,"Surely, in the creation of heavens and earth, and the alternation of night and day, and the ships that sail in the sea, carrying that which benefits men, and in the water Allah sent down from the sky, then revived with it the earth after it was dead, and in every creature He has scattered on it, and in turning of winds, and in the clouds employed to serve between heaven and earth, there are signs for those who have sense"
  2,165,"Among the people there are some who set up co-gods beside Allah whom they love like the love due to Allah. But those who believe are most firm in their love for Allah. Would that the unjust people could perceive - when they see the torment (i.e. any calamity in this world) - that all power belongs to Allah alone, and that Allah is severe in punishment"
  2,166,"(Imagine the time) when those who were followed will disown their followers, and they (all) will see the punishment, and the bonds between them will be cut asunder"
  2,167,"and those who followed will say, .We wish we had another (chance to) return (to the world), so that we may disown them as they had disowned us. Thus Allah will show them that their deeds were (nothing but) causes of remorse for them, and they are not to come out of the Fire"
  2,168,"O people, eat permissible good things out of what lies in the earth, and do not follow the footsteps of ShaiTan (Satan); indeed, he is an open enemy for you"
  2,169,"He orders you only to (do) evil and immodest acts, and that you ascribe to Allah what you do not know"
