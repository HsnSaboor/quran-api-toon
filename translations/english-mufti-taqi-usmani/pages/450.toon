quran[24]{c,v,t}:
  37,103,"So, (it was a great episode) when both of them submitted themselves (to Allah‘s will), and he laid him on his forehead (to slaughter him)"
  37,104,"and then We called out to him, .O Ibrahim"
  37,105,you did make the dream come true. This is how We reward those who are good in their deeds
  37,106,This was indeed a trial that clearly demonstrated (their obedience)
  37,107,And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice
  37,108,and We left for him (a word of praise) among the later people
  37,109,"(that is,) .Salam be on Ibrahim"
  37,110,This is how We reward those who are good in their deeds
  37,111,"Surely, he is among Our believing servants"
  37,112,"And We gave him the good news of IsHaq (Isaac), a prophet from among the righteous"
  37,113,"And We did bless him, and IsHaq. And among the progeny of both of them, some are good and some are utterly unjust to their own selves"
  37,114,Certainly We bestowed favors upon Musa and Harun
  37,115,and We delivered them and their people from the great agony
  37,116,"and We helped them, so they became victors"
  37,117,and We gave them the clear book
  37,118,and guided them to the straight path
  37,119,And We left for them (a word of praise) among the later people
  37,120,"(that is,) Salam be on Musa and Harun"
  37,121,This is how We reward those who are good in their deeds
  37,122,"Surely, both of them were among Our believing servants"
  37,123,"And surely, Ilyas is one of the messengers"
  37,124,"(Remember) when he said to his people: .Do you not fear Allah"
  37,125,"Do you invoke Ba‘l, and ignore the Best of the creators"
  37,126,"that is, Allah who is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers"
