quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,52,"Surely We have brought them a book that We have elaborated with knowledge, as guidance and mercy for a people who believe"
  7,53,"They are waiting for nothing but its final result (i.e. the punishment promised in the Qur‘an). The day when its final result will come, those who had ignored it earlier will say, .Surely, the messengers of our Lord had come with truth. So, are there any intercessors for us who could intercede in our favor? Or, could we be sent back, so that we might do contrary to what we used to do?. Indeed, they have put their selves to loss, and vanished from them all that they used to fabricate"
  7,54,"Surely, your Lord is Allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then He positioned himself on the Throne. He covers the day with the night that pursues it swiftly. (He created) the sun and the moon and the stars, subjugated to His command. Lo! To Him alone belong the creation and the command. Glorious is Allah, the Lord of all the worlds"
  7,55,"Supplicate to your Lord humbly and secretly. Surely, He does not like those who cross the limits"
  7,56,"Do not make mischief on the earth after it has been set in order. Supplicate Him in fear and hope. Surely, the mercy of Allah is close to those who are good in their deeds"
  7,57,"He is the One who sends the winds carrying good news before His blessings, until when they lift up the heavy clouds, We drive them to a dead land. Then, there We pour down water. Then, We bring forth with it all sorts of fruits. In similar way, We will bring forth all the dead. (All this is being explained to you), so that you may learn a lesson"
