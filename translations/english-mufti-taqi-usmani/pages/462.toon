quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  39,32,"So, who is more unjust than him who forges a lie against Allah and rejects the truth when it reached him? Is it not that in Jahannam (Hell) there is an abode for the disbelievers"
  39,33,"As for the one who has come with the truth and believed it to be true, then such people are the ones who are God-fearing"
  39,34,"For them, with their Lord, there is what they wish. That is the reward of those who are good in their deeds"
  39,35,"so that Allah wipes out from them the worst deeds they did, and gives their reward to them for the best of what they used to do"
  39,36,"Is Allah not sufficient for (the protection of) His slave? They are frightening you of those (false gods whom they worship) other than Him. Whomsoever Allah would let go astray, for him there is no one to guide"
  39,37,"And whomsoever Allah gives guidance, for him there is no one to misguide. Is it not that Allah is Mighty, Powerful to avenge"
  39,38,"If you ask them as to who created the heavens and the earth, they will certainly say, .Allah. Say, .Then, tell me about those whom you invoke other than Allah, if Allah intends to cause some harm to me, are they (able) to remove the harm caused by Him? Or if He intends to bless me with mercy, are they (able) to hold back His mercy (from me)?. Say, .Allah is sufficient for me. In Him trust those who (rightly) trust (in someone)"
  39,39,"Say, .O my people, do at your place (what you are doing). I am to do (what I have been ordered to). Very soon, you will come to know"
  39,40,"as to who will be visited by a punishment that will disgrace him, and upon whom a lasting punishment will rest"
