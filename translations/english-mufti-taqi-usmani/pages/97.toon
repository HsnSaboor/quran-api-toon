quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,114,"There is no good in most of their whisperings, unless one bids charity or a fair action, or reconciliation between people. The one who does this, to seek Allah‘s pleasure, We shall give him a great reward"
  4,115,"Whoever breaks away with the Messenger after the right path has become clear to him, and follows what is not the way of the believers, We shall let him have what he chose, and We shall admit him to Jahannam, which is an evil place to return"
  4,116,"Surely, Allah does not forgive that a partner is ascribed to Him, and forgives anything short of that for whomsoever He wills. Whoever ascribes a partner to Allah has indeed gone far astray"
  4,117,"They invoke none, besides Him, but feminine objects; and they invoke none but Satan, the rebel"
  4,118,"whom Allah has cursed. He (the Satan) said, .Surely I will take an appointed share from Your slaves"
  4,119,"and I will lead them astray, and I will tempt them with false hopes, and I will command them, whereby they shall slit the ears of cattle, and I will command them, whereby they shall alter the creation of Allah. Whoever takes the Satan for friend, instead of Allah, incurs an obvious loss"
  4,120,"He (the Satan) makes promises to them, and he tempts them with hopes. The Satan does not make a promise to them but to deceive"
  4,121,"As for such people, their refuge is Jahannam, and they shall find no escape from it"
