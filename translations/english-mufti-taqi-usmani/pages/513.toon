quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  48,16,"Say to those of the Bedouins who remained behind, .You will be called against a people possessed of strong fighting power; you will have to fight them until they submit. So if you obey, Allah will give you a good reward, and if you turn away, as you had turned away earlier, He will punish you with a painful punishment"
  48,17,"There is no blame on the blind, nor is there any blame on the lame, nor is there any blame on the sick. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him to the gardens beneath which rivers flow. But whoever turns away, He will punish him with a painful punishment"
  48,18,"Allah was pleased with the believers when they were pledging allegiance with you (by placing their hands in your hands) under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquility upon them, and rewarded them with a victory, near at hand"
  48,19,"and many spoils that they would receive. And Allah is Mighty, Wise"
  48,20,"Allah had promised you many spoils that you would receive, so He gave these to you sooner, and stopped the hands of the people from (harming) you. And (He did this) so that it becomes a sign for believers, and so that He guides you to the right path"
  48,21,"And (there is) another (victory) that has not come within your power as yet, (but) Allah has encompassed it. And Allah is Powerful over every thing"
  48,22,"Had the disbelievers fought you, they would have certainly turned their backs, then they would have found neither a supporter nor a helper"
  48,23,"according to the consistent practice of Allah that went on since before, and you will never find a change in Allah‘s consistent practice"
