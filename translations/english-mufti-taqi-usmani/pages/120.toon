quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  5,71,"They thought that no harm would follow. Therefore, they became blind and deaf. Then, Allah accepted their repentance, but again they turned blind and deaf, many of them. Allah is watchful of what they do"
  5,72,"Surely, disbelievers are those who say, .Allah is the MasiH, son of Maryam. while the MasiH had said, .O children of Isra‘il , worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. In fact, whoever ascribes any partner to Allah, Allah has prohibited for him the Jannah (the Paradise), and his shelter is the Fire, and there will be no supporters for the unjust"
  5,73,"Surely, disbelievers are those who say, .Allah is the third of the three. while there is no god but One God. If they do not desist from what they say, a painful punishment shall certainly befall such disbelievers"
  5,74,"Why then do they not turn to Allah in repentance and seek His forgiveness, while Allah is most forgiving, very merciful"
  5,75,"The MasiH, son of Maryam, is no more than a Messenger. There have been messengers before him. His mother was very truthful. Both of them used to eat food. Look how We explain signs to them, then see how far they are turned away"
  5,76,"Say, .Do you worship, besides Allah, what has no power to do you harm or bring you benefit?. Allah is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing"
