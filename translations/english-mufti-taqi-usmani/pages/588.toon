quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  83,7,Never! (i.e. they should never act in such a way.) Indeed the record of deeds of the sinners is in Sijjin
  83,8,And what may let you know what Sijjin is
  83,9,"A register, inscribed"
  83,10,Woe that day to the deniers
  83,11,who deny the Day of Requital
  83,12,And none denies it but every sinful transgressor
  83,13,"When Our verses are recited to him, he says, .(These are) tales of the ancients"
  83,14,No! But that which they used to commit has covered their hearts with rust
  83,15,No! Indeed they will be screened off from their Lord on that Day
  83,16,Then they will have to enter the Hell
  83,17,"Then it will be said, .This is what you used to deny"
  83,18,No! The record of deeds of the righteous is in ‘Illiyyun
  83,19,And what may let you know what ‘Illiyyun is
  83,20,A register inscribed
  83,21,attended by those (angels) who are blessed with nearness to Allah
  83,22,Indeed the righteous will be in absolute bliss
  83,23,While (sitting) on thrones they will be watching (the scenes of Paradise)
  83,24,You will recognize the glamour of bliss on their faces
  83,25,They will be served with a pure sealed wine to drink
  83,26,the seal of which will be of musk.___It is this (bliss) in aspiring for which the competitors should race each other
  83,27,and it will be blended with (a drink from) Tasnim
  83,28,a spring from which will drink those who are blessed with nearness
  83,29,Indeed those who were guilty used to laugh at those who believed
  83,30,"and when they passed by them, they used to wink at one another"
  83,31,"and when they went back to their family, they went enjoying their mockery"
  83,32,"and when they saw them, they said, .Surely these are the ones who have gone astray"
  83,33,while they were not sent as watchmen over them
  83,34,"So, today those who believed will laugh at the disbelievers"
