quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,1,"They ask you about the spoils. Say, .The spoils are for Allah and the Messenger. So, fear Allah, and set your relations right, and obey Allah and His Messenger, if you are believers"
  8,2,"Certainly, the believers are those whose hearts are filled with awe when (the name of) Allah is mentioned; and when His verses are recited to them, it makes them more developed in faith; and in their Lord they place their trust"
  8,3,"(They are) those who establish Salah, and give away from what We have given to them"
  8,4,"Those are the believers in reality. For them there are high ranks with their Lord, and forgiveness, and dignified provision"
  8,5,"It is like when your Lord made you leave your home for the sake of truth, while a group from the believers were averse to it"
  8,6,"they were disputing with you about the truth after it became clear, as if they were being driven to death being seen by them"
  8,7,"And recall when Allah was promising you that one of the two groups would become yours, and you were wishing that the one without strength should fall to you. And Allah wanted to establish the truth through His words and to cut off the very root of the disbelievers"
  8,8,"so that He proves the truth to be true and the falsehood to be false, even though the sinners might dislike it"
