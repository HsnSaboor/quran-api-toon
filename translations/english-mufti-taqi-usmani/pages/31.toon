quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  2,197,"The Hajj is (to be performed in) the months that are well-known. So whoever undertakes Hajj in them, there should be no obscenity, no sin, no quarrel in the Hajj. Whatever good you do, Allah will know it. Take provisions along, for the merit of (having) provision is to abstain (from begging), and fear Me, O men of understanding"
  2,198,"There is no sin on you that you seek the grace of your Lord (by trading). Later, when you flow down from ‘Arafat, recite the name of Allah near Al-Mash‘ar-ul-Haram (the Sacred Monument), and recite His name as He has guided you, while before it, you were among the astray"
  2,199,"Then flow down from where the people flow, and seek forgiveness from Allah. Certainly Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful"
  2,200,"Once you have fulfilled your modes of worship in Hajj, recite the name of Allah, as you would speak of your forefathers or even with greater fervor. Now among the people there is one who says: .Our Lord, give to us in this world.. and he has no share in the Hereafter"
  2,201,"Yet there is another among them who says: .Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and save us from the punishment of Fire"
  2,202,For them there is a share of what they have earned; and Allah is swift at reckoning
