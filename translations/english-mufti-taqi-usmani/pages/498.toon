quran[20]{c,v,t}:
  44,40,The Day of Decision is the appointed time for all of them
  44,41,"the day when no close relation will be of any use to any close relation, nor will they be helped"
  44,42,"except the One on whom Allah has mercy. Of course, He is the All-Mighty, the Very-Merciful"
  44,43,Indeed the tree of zaqqum
  44,44,is the food of the sinful
  44,45,like dregs of oil. It will boil in the bellies
  44,46,like the boiling of hot water
  44,47,"(It will be said to angels,) .Seize him, and drag him into the midst of the Hell"
  44,48,Then pour on his head some torment of boiling water
  44,49,"Have a taste! You are the ‘man of might‘, the ‘man of honour‘"
  44,50,This is the thing about which you used to be skeptic
  44,51,Indeed the God-fearing will be in a place free from fear
  44,52,in gardens and fountains
  44,53,"They will be dressed in fine silk and thick silk, facing each other"
  44,54,"Thus (it will happen,) and We will marry them with houris having big dark eyes"
  44,55,They will call therein for every fruit peacefully
  44,56,They will not taste death therein beyond the first death (they faced in the world). And He (Allah) will save them from the torment of Hell
  44,57,as a favour from your Lord. That is the great achievement
  44,58,"So, We had made it (the Qur‘an) easy in your tongue, so that they may take lesson"
  44,59,Now wait. They too are waiting
