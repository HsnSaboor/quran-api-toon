quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,75,"What has happened to you that you do not fight in the way of Allah, and for the oppressed among men, women and children who say, .Our Lord, take us out from this town whose people are cruel, and make for us a supporter from Your own, and make for us a helper from Your own"
  4,76,"The believers fight in the way of Allah, and the disbelievers fight in the way of Taghut. So, fight the friends of Satan. No doubt, the guile of Satan is feeble"
  4,77,"Have you not seen those to whom it was said, .Hold your hands (from fighting) and be steadfast in Salah and pay Zakah. However, when fighting is enjoined upon them, then surprisingly, a group from them starts fearing people, as one would fear Allah, or fearing even more. They say, .Our Lord, why have you enjoined fighting upon us? Would you have not spared us for a little more time?. Say, .The enjoyment of the world is but a little, and the Hereafter is far better for the one who fears Allah, and you shall not be wronged, even to the measure of a fiber"
  4,78,"Wherever you will be, Death will overtake you, even though you are in fortified castles. If some good comes to them, they say, .This is from Allah. But if some evil visits them, they say, .This is from you. Say, .All is from Allah. So, what is wrong with these people, they do not seem to understand anything"
  4,79,"Whatever good comes to you, it is from Allah and whatever evil visits you, it comes from your own selves. We have sent you to be a Messenger for the people. Allah is enough to be a witness"
