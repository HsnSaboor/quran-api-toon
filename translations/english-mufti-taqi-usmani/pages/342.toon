quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,1,Success is really attained by the believers
  23,2,who concentrate their attention in humbleness when offering Salah (prayers)
  23,3,and who keep themselves away from vain things
  23,4,and who are performers of Zakah
  23,5,and who guard their private parts
  23,6,"except from their wives or from those (bondwomen who are) owned by their hands, as they are not to be blamed"
  23,7,"However, those who seek (sexual pleasure) beyond that are the transgressors"
  23,8,– and (success is attained) by those who honestly look after their trusts and covenant
  23,9,and who consistently observe their prayers
  23,10,Those are the inheritors
  23,11,who will inherit Firdaus (the Paradise). They will be there forever
  23,12,We have created man from an extract of clay
  23,13,Then We made him a sperm-drop in a firm resting place
  23,14,"Then We turned the sperm-drop into a clot, then We turned the clot into a fetus-lump, then We turned the fetus-lump into bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh; thereafter We developed it into another creature. So, glorious is Allah, the Best of the creators"
  23,15,"Then, after all this, you are to die"
  23,16,Then you are to be raised again on the Day of Judgment
  23,17,"And We created above you seven paths (heavens), and We were never neglectful of the creation"
