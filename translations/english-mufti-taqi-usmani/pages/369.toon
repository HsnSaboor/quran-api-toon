quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  26,40,so that we may follow the sorcerers if they are victorious
  26,41,"So, when the sorcerers came, they said to Pharaoh, .Will there be a sure reward for us, if we are the victorious"
  26,42,"He said, .Yes, and of course, you will then be among the closer ones"
  26,43,"Musa said to them, .Throw you down what you are to throw"
  26,44,"So they threw down their ropes and their staffs and said, .By the majesty of Pharaoh, we will be the triumphant for sure"
  26,45,"Then Musa threw down his staff, and in no time it started swallowing the falsehood they invented"
  26,46,So the sorcerers were made (by the truth they saw) to fall down in prostration
  26,47,"They said, .We have believed in the Lord of the worlds"
  26,48,the Lord of Musa and Harun
  26,49,"He (Pharaoh) said, .You have believed in him before I permit you. Surely, he (Musa) is the chief of you all, who has taught you sorcery. So you will soon know (your fate). I will cut off your hands and feet from different sides, and will crucify you all together"
  26,50,"They said, .There is no harm. We will return to our Lord"
  26,51,"We really hope that our Lord will forgive us our faults, as we are the first of the believers"
  26,52,"And We revealed to Musa saying, .Make My servants travel at night. You will be pursued"
  26,53,So Pharaoh sent into the cities (his) men to muster (people)
  26,54,"saying, .These are a small band"
  26,55,and indeed they are enraging us
  26,56,"and we are a host, well-armed"
  26,57,Thus We expelled them (i.e. the people of Pharaoh) from gardens and springs
  26,58,and from treasures and a noble abode
  26,59,Thus it was. And We made the children of Isra‘il inherit all such things
  26,60,So they (the people of Pharaoh) pursued them (the people of Musa) at the time of sunrise
