quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  30,51,"Should We send a (harmful) wind, and they see it (the tillage) turning yellow, then they will turn ungrateful, even after all the aforesaid (bounties of Allah)"
  30,52,"So, you cannot make the dead to hear, nor can you make the deaf to hear the call when they turn their backs in retreat"
  30,53,"Nor are you (able) to show the right path to the blind against their straying. You can make none to listen except those who believe in Our signs, hence they submit"
  30,54,"Allah is the One who created you in a state of weakness, then He created strength after weakness, then created weakness and old age after strength. He creates what He wills, and He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful"
  30,55,"And on the Day when the Hour (Qiyamah : the Day of Judgement) will take place, the sinners will swear that they did not remain (in the graves) more than one hour. In the similar way they used to be contrary (to truth in their worldly life)"
  30,56,"As for those who were given knowledge and belief, they will say, .You remained, according to the destiny written by Allah, up to the Day of Resurrection. So this is the Day of Resurrection, but you had no belief"
  30,57,"So, on that Day, their apology will not benefit the wrongdoers, nor will they be asked to repent"
  30,58,"Indeed We have given in this Qur‘an all kinds of examples for the benefit of mankind. (Still) if you bring to them a sign, the disbelievers will certainly say, .You are nothing but men of falsehood"
  30,59,Thus Allah seals up the hearts of those who do not believe
  30,60,"So, be patient. Surely Allah‘s promise is true, and let not the disbelievers shake your firmness"
