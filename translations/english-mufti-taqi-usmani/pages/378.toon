quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  27,14,"And they denied them out of sheer injustice and arrogance, though their hearts believed them (to be true). See, then, how was the fate of the mischief-makers"
  27,15,"Surely We gave knowledge to Dawud and Sulaiman, and they said, .Praise belongs to Allah who made us excel many of His believing servants"
  27,16,"And Sulaiman inherited (the traits of) Dawud and said, .O people we have been taught the speech of birds, and all sorts of things are given to us. Indeed, this is the evident grace (of Allah)"
  27,17,And mustered for Sulaiman were his forces from among the Jinns and the humans and the birds. So all of them were kept under (his) control
  27,18,"until when they reached the valley of the ants, one of the ants said, .O ants, enter your dwelling places, lest Sulaiman and his armies crush you unknowingly"
  27,19,"So he (Sulaiman) smiled, laughing on her speech and said, .My Lord, enable me to become grateful to Your favor that you have bestowed on me and on my parents, and to do good deeds that You like, and admit me, with Your mercy, among Your righteous servants"
  27,20,"And (once) he (Sulaiman) checked the birds and said, .How is it with me that I do not see the hudhud (hoopoe)? Rather he has disappeared"
  27,21,I will punish him with a severe punishment or slaughter him unless he brings to me a clear plea
  27,22,"Then the hoopoe did not take long and said (to Sulaiman), .I have discovered what you did not, and have brought to you a sure information from Saba‘ (Sheba)"
