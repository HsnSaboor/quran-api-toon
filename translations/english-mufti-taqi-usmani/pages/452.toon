quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  37,154,What is the matter with you? How (arbitrarily) do you judge
  37,155,"Then, is it that you do not think about it"
  37,156,"Or, is it that there is some open authority with you"
  37,157,"Then bring your book, if you are truthful"
  37,158,"And they have made up between Him (Allah) and the Jinns some kinship, while the Jinns already know that they are bound to be seized"
  37,159,Pure is Allah from what they describe
  37,160,except Allah‘s chosen servants
  37,161,"So, you and those whom you worship"
  37,162,none of you can make anyone turn away from Him (Allah)
  37,163,except him who is to burn in Jahannam
  37,164,"And (the angels say,) .There is no one among us who does not have a known station"
  37,165,"and We, surely We, are those who stand in rows"
  37,166,"and We, surely We, are those who proclaim Allah‘s purity"
  37,167,And they (the pagans) used to say
  37,168,Had there been a scripture with us like that of the former people
  37,169,we would have certainly been Allah‘s chosen servants
  37,170,"Then (once the divine book came to them,) they disbelieved in it. So, very soon they will come to know"
  37,171,"And Our Word has already come to pass in favor of Our servants, the messengers"
  37,172,(that) they are the ones who will be supported
  37,173,and verily it is Our army (of chosen servants) that prevails
  37,174,"So, withdraw your attention from them for some time"
  37,175,"But, watch them. They shall soon see (the reality)"
  37,176,Are they asking for Our punishment to come sooner
  37,177,"So, when it will descend in their courtyard, then, evil will be the morning of those warned"
  37,178,"So, withdraw your attention from them for some time"
  37,179,and watch. They shall soon see (the reality)
  37,180,"Pure is your Lord, the Lord of all might and honor, from what they describe"
  37,181,and Salam be on the messengers
  37,182,"and praised is Allah, the Lord of all the worlds"
