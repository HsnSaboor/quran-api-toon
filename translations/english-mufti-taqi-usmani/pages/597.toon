quran[27]{c,v,t}:
  95,1,I swear by the Fig and the Olive
  95,2,"and by Tur, the mount of Sinai"
  95,3,and by this peaceful city
  95,4,We have created man in the best composition
  95,5,then We turned him into the lowest of the low
  95,6,"except those who believed and did righteous deeds, because for them there is a reward never ending"
  95,7,"So, what can make you, after all this, to deny the Requital"
  95,8,Is Allah not the Greatest Ruler of all the rulers
  96,1,Read with the name of your Lord who created (every thing)
  96,2,He created man from a clot of blood
  96,3,"Read, and your Lord is the most gracious"
  96,4,who imparted knowledge by means of the pen
  96,5,He taught man what he did not know
  96,6,"In fact, man crosses the limits"
  96,7,because he deems himself to be free of need
  96,8,Surely to your Lord is the return
  96,9,Have you seen him who forbids
  96,10,a servant of Allah when he prays
  96,11,"Tell me, if he is on the right path"
  96,12,"or bids piety, (would the former still forbid him)"
  96,13,"Tell me, if he rejects (the true faith) and turns away"
  96,14,does he not know that Allah is watching (him)
  96,15,"No! If he does not desist, We will certainly drag (him) by forelock"
  96,16,"a lying, sinful forelock"
  96,17,So let him call the men of his council
  96,18,We will call the soldiers of the Hell
  96,19,"No! Never obey him, and bow down in sajdah, and come close to Me"
