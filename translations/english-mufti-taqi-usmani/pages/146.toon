quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  6,138,"They say, .These are prohibited cattle and produce; none can eat them except those whom we wish. - so they claimed - .and there are cattle whose backs are prohibited (for riding or loading)., and there are cattle over which they do not pronounce the name of Allah,__all being fabrications against Him. He will soon punish them for what they have been fabricating"
  6,139,"They say, .Whatever is in the wombs of these cattle is purely for our males, and forbidden to our wives. If it be born dead, then all of them share in it. Soon, He will punish them for what they attribute. Surely, He is All-Wise, All-Knowing"
  6,140,"Losers are those who kill their children foolishly, without knowledge, and hold as prohibited what Allah has provided them, falsely ascribing it to Allah. They have gone astray, and they are not on the right path"
  6,141,"He is the One who has created gardens, trellised and untrellised, and date-palms and crops with a variety of edibles, and the olive and the pomegranate, (some) similar to one another, and (some) dissimilar. Eat of its fruit when it bears fruits, and pay its due on the day of harvest, and do not be extravagant. Surely, Allah does not like the extravagant"
  6,142,"Among cattle (He has created) those fit for loading and those fit for laying on the floor. Eat of what Allah has provided you, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Surely, he is an open enemy to you"
