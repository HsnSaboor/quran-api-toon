quran[25]{c,v,t}:
  82,1,When the sky will be cleft asunder
  82,2,and when the stars will disperse
  82,3,and when the seas will be burst forth
  82,4,and when the graves will be overturned
  82,5,then one will know what he sent ahead and what he left behind
  82,6,O man! What has deceived you about your Gracious Lord
  82,7,"who created you, then perfected you, then brought you in due proportion"
  82,8,He composed you in whichever form He willed
  82,9,Never! (i.e. one should never be heedless towards him.) But you deny the Requital
  82,10,while (appointed) over you there are watchers
  82,11,"who are noble, writers (of the deeds)"
  82,12,who know whatever you do
  82,13,Surely the righteous will be in bliss
  82,14,and the sinners in Hell
  82,15,in which they will enter on the Day of Requital
  82,16,and they will not (be able to) keep away from it
  82,17,And what may let you know what the Day of Requital is
  82,18,"Again, what may let you know what the Day of Requital is"
  82,19,"A Day when no one will have power to do any thing for another! And command, on that Day, will belong to Allah (alone)"
  83,1,Woe to the curtailers
  83,2,"who, when they measure something to receive from people, take it in full"
  83,3,"and when they measure or weigh something to give it to them, give less than due"
  83,4,Do they not think that they have to be raised up
  83,5,on a Great Day
  83,6,the Day when all the people will stand before the Lord of the worlds
