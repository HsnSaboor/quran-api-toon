quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,27,"Then, on the Day of Judgment, He will put them to disgrace and will say, .Where are My partners for whose sake you used to quarrel (with the believers)?. Those endowed with knowledge will say, .Today, the disgrace and the evil (chastisement) has to befall the unbelievers"
  16,28,"the ones to whom the angels brought death while they were (still) wronging themselves. Then, they will resort to submission, (yet will say), .We used to do nothing wrong. (They will be answered) Why not? Allah knows well what you used to do"
  16,29,"Hence, enter the gates of Jahannam to live in it forever. So evil is the abode of the arrogant"
  16,30,"And (on the other hand,) it is said to the God-fearing, .What has your Lord sent down?. They say, .(He has sent down) excellent (discourse). For those who do good, there is good (end) in this world, and indeed the abode of the Hereafter is much better. Excellent is the abode of the God- fearing"
  16,31,"the eternal gardens they enter, with rivers flowing beneath them. For them there is what they desire. That is how Allah rewards the God-fearing"
  16,32,"the ones to whom angels bring death while they are pure (in beliefs and deeds). They (angels) say, .Peace on you! Enter Paradise for the deeds you have been doing"
  16,33,"They (the unbelievers) are waiting for nothing but that the angels should come to them, or comes the command of your Lord. Similar was the reaction of those who were before them. Allah did not wrong them; rather they were doing wrong to themselves"
  16,34,"So, the evils of what they did overtook them, and they were encircled by the very thing they used to ridicule"
