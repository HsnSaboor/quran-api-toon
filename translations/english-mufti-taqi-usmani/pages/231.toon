quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,82,"So, when Our command came to pass, We turned their habitations upside down, and rained on it stones of hard clay, one over another"
  11,83,marked from your Lord. And it is not far from the transgressors
  11,84,"And to Madyan (We sent) their brother, Shu‘aib. He said, .O my people, worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. And do not curtail the measure and the weight. I see you quite well off, and I fear for you the punishment of an encircling day"
  11,85,"And O my people, perfect the measure and the balance with justice and do not make the people short of their things, and do not go about the earth spreading disorder"
  11,86,"Whatever is allowed by Allah to retain (lawfully) is better for you, if you are believers. And I am not a watchman over you"
  11,87,"They said, .O Shu‘aib, does your Salah (prayer) command you that we should forsake what our fathers used to worship or that we should not deal with our wealth as we please? You pretend to be the only man of wisdom and guidance"
  11,88,"He said, .O my people, tell me, if I am on a clear path from my Lord and He has provided me with a good provision from Himself, (should I still leave you unguided?) I do not want to do in your absence what I forbid you from. I want nothing but to set things right as far as I can. My ability to do any thing comes from none but Allah. In Him alone I have placed my trust and to Him alone I turn in humbleness"
