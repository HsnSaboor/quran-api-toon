quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  36,41,And it is a sign for them that We boarded their children in the loaded ship
  36,42,and created for them things similar to it on which they ride
  36,43,"And if We so will, We can drown them; then no one will respond to their cry, nor will they be rescued"
  36,44,"unless there be mercy from Us, and (unless) We let them enjoy for a while"
  36,45,"And (they pay no heed) when it is said to them, .Save yourselves from that (punishment) which is before you (in this world) and that which will come after you (die), so that you may receive mercy"
  36,46,"There comes to them no sign from the signs of your Lord, but they turn averse to it"
  36,47,"And when it is said to them, .Spend (to the needy) from the provision Allah has given to you., the disbelievers say to the believers, .Shall we feed those whom Allah could have fed, if Allah so willed? You are but in open error"
  36,48,"And they say, .When will this promise come true, if you are truthful"
  36,49,They are looking for nothing but for a single Cry that will seize them when they will be quarrelling
  36,50,"So they will not be able to make a bequest, nor will they return to their household"
  36,51,"And the Horn will be blown, and suddenly they will be rushing from their graves towards their Lord"
  36,52,"They will say, .Woe to us! Who has raised us from our sleeping place? .This is what RaHman (the All-Merciful Allah) had promised, and the messengers had told the truth"
  36,53,"It will be no more than a single Cry, and in no time they will all be arraigned before Us"
  36,54,"Then, nobody will be subjected to injustice in the least, and you will not be recompensed but for what you used to do"
