quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  24,11,"Those who have come up with the false imputation are a gang among you. Do not think it is bad for you; rather, it is good for you. Every one of them is liable for what he earned of the sin. And the one who played the major role in it, for him there is a mighty punishment"
  24,12,"Why - when you (O believers) heard of it – did the believing men and the believing women not think well about their own selves, and (why did they not) say, .This is a manifest lie"
  24,13,"Why did they (the accusers) not bring four witnesses to prove this? So, as they did not bring the witnesses, they are the liars in the sight of Allah"
  24,14,"Had it not been for the grace of Allah upon you, and His mercy in this world and in the Hereafter, a severe punishment would have reached you for what you indulged in"
  24,15,"when you were welcoming it with your tongues, and were saying with your mouths something of which you had no knowledge, and were taking it as a trivial matter, while in the sight of Allah it was grave"
  24,16,"And why, when you heard of it, did you not say, .It is not for us to speak about this. Pure are You (O Allah). This is a terrible calumny"
  24,17,"Allah admonishes you never to repeat something like this, if you are believers"
  24,18,"Allah makes the signs clear to you, and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  24,19,"Surely, those who like that lewdness spreads among the believers, for them there is painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. Allah knows, and you do not know"
  24,20,"Had it not been for the grace of Allah upon you, and His mercy, and that Allah is Very-Kind, Very-Merciful (you would have been destroyed)"
