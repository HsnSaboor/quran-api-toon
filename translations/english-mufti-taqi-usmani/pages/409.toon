quran[9]{c,v,t}:

  30,43,Then set your face to the straight Faith before the arrival of a day that will never be repulsed by Allah. On that Day the people will be split apart
  30,44,"Whoever disbelieves, his unbelief will be against him; and whoever acts righteously, then such people are paving the path for themselves"
  30,45,"so that Allah may give reward, out of His grace, to those who believed and did righteous deeds. Surely He does not love the unbelievers"
  30,46,"And among His signs is that He sends winds giving good news (of rain), and so that He gives you a taste of His mercy, and that the ships may sail with His command, and that you may search for His grace, and you may be grateful"
  30,47,We had indeed sent before you messengers to their people. So they came to them with clear proofs. Then We took vengeance upon those who were guilty; and it was due on Us to help the believers
  30,48,"Allah is the One who sends the winds, so they stir up a cloud, then He spreads it in the sky however he wills, and makes it (split) into pieces. Then you see the rain coming out from its midst. So, once He makes it reach those whom He wills from His slaves, they start rejoicing"
  30,49,even though they were absolutely hopeless before it was sent down to them
  30,50,"So, look to the effects of Allah‘s mercy, how He gives life to the earth after its death. Surely, That (Allah) is the One who will give life to the dead; and He has the power to do everything"
