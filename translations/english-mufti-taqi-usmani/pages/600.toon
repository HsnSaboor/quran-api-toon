quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  100,10,and all that is contained in the hearts will be exposed
  100,11,"Surely your Lord, that day, is fully aware of them"
  101,1,The Striking Event
  101,2,What is the Striking Event
  101,3,And what may let you know what the Striking Event is
  101,4,(It will happen) on a day when people will be like scattered moths
  101,5,and the mountains will be like carded wool
  101,6,"Then, as for him whose scales (of good deeds) are heavy"
  101,7,he will be in a happy life
  101,8,But he whose scales are light
  101,9,his abode will be Abyss
  101,10,And what may let you know what that (Abyss) is
  101,11,A blazing Fire
  102,1,You are distracted by mutual competition in amassing (worldly benefits)
  102,2,until you reach the graves
  102,3,No! (This is not a correct attitude.) You will soon know (the reality)
  102,4,"Again, you will soon know"
  102,5,No! Only if you knew (it) with a sure knowledge
  102,6,You will certainly see the Hell
  102,7,then you will see it with full certitude
  102,8,Then you will be asked about all the pleasures (you enjoyed in the world)
