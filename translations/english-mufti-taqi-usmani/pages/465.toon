  39,58,"or, (lest) someone should say when he sees the punishment, .Would that I have a chance to return, so that I may become one of those who are good in their deeds"
  39,59,"No! My verses had reached you, but you called them untrue, and waxed proud, and became of those who disbelieved"
  39,60,"And on the Day of Judgment, you will see those who had forged lies against Allah (in a state) that their faces are turned black. Is it not that in Jahannam there is an abode for the arrogant"
  39,61,"And Allah will save the God-fearing (from Jahannam ), with utmost success granted to them, so as no evil will touch them, nor will they grieve"
  39,62,"Allah is Creator of everything, and He is the Guardian over everything"

  39,65,"It has already been revealed to you and to those before you (that): If you associate (partners with Allah), your deeds shall be rendered useless, and you shall be among the losers"
  39,66,"On the contrary, it is Allah whom you should worship; and be among the grateful"
  39,67,"They did not hold Allah in His true esteem. The whole earth will be in a single grip of His hand on the Day of Doom, and the heavens (will be) rolled up on his right hand. Pure is He, far too higher than what they associate with Him"
