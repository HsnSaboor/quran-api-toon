quran[32]{c,v,t}:
  86,1,I swear by the sky and by the Night-Comer
  86,2,and what may let you know what the Night-Comer is
  86,3,The star of piercing brightness
  86,4,"there is no human being, but there is a watcher over him"
  86,5,"So, let man consider of which stuff he is created"
  86,6,He is created of spouting water
  86,7,that comes out from between the loins and the chest-bones
  86,8,Surely He is Powerful to bring him back
  86,9,on a day when all the secrets will be searched out
  86,10,"and he will have neither strength (to defend), nor a supporter"
  86,11,I swear by the sky that rains
  86,12,and the earth that cracks open (for plants)
  86,13,this is a decisive word
  86,14,and it is not a joke
  86,15,They are devising plans
  86,16,and I Am devising plans
  86,17,So leave the disbelievers alone at the moment; give them respite for a while
  87,1,Pronounce the purity of the name of your most exalted Lord
  87,2,"who created (everything), then made (it) well"
  87,3,"and who determined a measure (for everything), then guided (it)"
  87,4,and who brought forth pasturage
  87,5,then turned it into a blackening stubble
  87,6,"We will make you recite, then you will not forget"
  87,7,except that which Allah wills. Indeed He knows what is manifest and what is hidden
  87,8,And We will facilitate for you (to reach) the easiest way
  87,9,"So, extend advice (to people) if advice is useful"
  87,10,The one who fears (Allah) will observe the advice
  87,11,and it will be avoided by the most wretched one
  87,12,who will enter the Biggest Fire
  87,13,"then he will neither die therein, nor live (a desirable life)"
  87,14,Success is surely achieved by him who purifies himself
  87,15,"and pronounces the name of his Lord, then offers prayer"
