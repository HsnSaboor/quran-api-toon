quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  13,19,"Now, can the one who knows that whatever has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, be equal to one who is blind? Only the people of understanding respond to the advice —"
  13,20,those who fulfill (their) pledge with Allah and do not break the covenant
  13,21,and those who maintain the relationships Allah has commanded to be maintained and fear their Lord and are frightful of evil reckoning
  13,22,"and those who observe patience in order to seek the pleasure of their Lord and establish Salah and spend secretly and openly from what We have given to them, and repel evil with good. Those are the ones for whom there is the ultimate abode"
  13,23,"the eternal gardens they enter, and those as well who are righteous from their fathers, spouses, and progeny. The angels will enter onto them from every gate"
  13,24,"(saying) .Peace on you for the patience you observed. So, how excellent is the ultimate abode"
  13,25,"As for those who break their pledge with Allah after it has been made binding, and cut off the relationships Allah has commanded to be joined, and make mischief in the land, those are the ones for whom there is the curse, and for them there is the evil abode"
  13,26,"Allah expands the provision for whom He wills and narrows it (for whom He wills). They are happy with the worldly life, while the worldly life, compared to the Hereafter, is nothing but a little enjoyment"
  13,27,"The disbelievers say, .Why is it that no sign (of their choice) has been sent down to him from his Lord?. Say, .Allah lets go astray whom He wills and gives guidance to those who turn to Him"
  13,28,"the ones who believe and their hearts are peaceful with the remembrance of Allah. Listen, the hearts find peace only in the remembrance of Allah"
