quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  5,109,"(Be mindful of) the day when Allah will assemble the messengers and will say to them, .How were you responded to?. They will say, .We have no knowledge. Surely You alone have the full knowledge of all that is unseen"
  5,110,"(Call to mind the time) when Allah will say, .O ‘Isa, son of Maryam, remember My blessing upon you and upon your mother; when I supported you with the Holy Spirit. You spoke to people while you were still in the cradle and when you grew to middle age. I taught you the Book and the Wisdom, the Torah and the Injil. You created from clay something in the shape of a bird, then you blew on it, and it became a bird by My leave. You cured those born blind and lepers by My leave. You raised the dead by My leave. I kept the children of Isra‘il away from you when you came to them with clear signs, and the disbelievers among them said, .This is nothing but a clear magic"
  5,111,"When I enjoined upon the disciples (of ‘Isa ), .Believe in Me and in My Messenger,. they said, .We believed. Bear witness that we are the submitting ones"
  5,112,"When the disciples said, .O ‘Isa, son of Maryam, can your Lord send down to us a repast from the heavens?. He said, .Fear Allah if you are believers"
  5,113,"They said, .We wish that we eat from it, and our hearts be satisfied, and we may know for sure that you have told us the truth, and we may become witnesses to it"
