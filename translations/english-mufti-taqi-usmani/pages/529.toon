  54,11,So We opened the gates of the sky with water pouring forth profusely
  54,12,and We caused the earth to gush forth as springs; so the water (of both kinds) met together for a destined event
  54,13,And We caused him (NuH) to board that (ship) which had planks and nails
  54,14,"which sailed under Our Eyes, as a reward for the one who was rejected (by the infidels)"
