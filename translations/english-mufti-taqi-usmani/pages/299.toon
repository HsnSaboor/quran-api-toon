quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  18,46,"Wealth and children are the embellishment of the worldly life, and the everlasting virtues are better with your Lord, both in rewards and in creating good hopes"
  18,47,"And (visualize) the Day when We will make mountains move, and you will see the earth fully exposed, and We shall gather them together, so as not to leave a single one of them"
  18,48,"And they shall be presented lined-up before your Lord. (It will be said to them,) .Lo! You have come to Us just as We had created you for the first time, while you claimed that We would not make any appointed time for you"
  18,49,"And the book (of deeds) will be placed (before them), then you will see the guilty people scared of its contents and saying, .Woe to us! What a book is this! It has missed nothing, minor or major, but has taken it into account. Thus they will find whatever they did present before them, and your Lord will not wrong anyone"
  18,50,"(Recall) when We said to the angels, .Prostrate yourselves before ‘Adam. So, they prostrated themselves, all of them but Iblis (Satan). He was of the Jinn, so he rebelled against the command of your Lord. Do you still take him and his progeny as friends instead of Me, while they are enemy to you? Evil is he as substitute (of obedience to Allah) for wrongdoers"
  18,51,"I did not make them witnesses of the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor of their own creation. I was not such that I should take the misleaders as helpers"
  18,52,"(Recall) the Day when He will say, .Call My ‘partners‘ whom you claimed as such. So, they will call them, but they will not respond to them, and We will put a destructive barrier between them"
  18,53,"And the sinners will see the Fire; so they will know that they will have to fall into it, and they will find no way to bypass it"
