quran[34]{c,v,t}:
  56,17,Immortal boys will rotate around them
  56,18,with bowls and jugs and a goblet of pure wine
  56,19,"from which they will neither suffer headache, nor will they be intoxicated"
  56,20,and with fruits that they choose
  56,21,and the flesh of birds that they desire
  56,22,"And (for them there will be) houris, having lovely big eyes"
  56,23,all (neat and clean) like a hidden pearl
  56,24,as a reward for what they used to do
  56,25,"They will hear neither an absurd talk in it, nor something leading to sin"
  56,26,"but (they will hear) the words of Salam , Salam (as greetings)"
  56,27,And the People of the right? How (lucky) are the People of the Right
  56,28,(They will be) amid lote-trees with no thorns
  56,29,"and the trees of TalH , (banana, or a fragrant tree) having layers one upon the other"
  56,30,"and a shade, spread all over"
  56,31,"and water, poured forth"
  56,32,and a lot of fruits
  56,33,"neither interrupted (in any season), nor prohibited"
  56,34,and mattresses of high quality
  56,35,Surely We have made up those females in a special creation
  56,36,and have made them virgins
  56,37,"amorous to their husbands, matching them in age"
  56,38,for the People of the Right
  56,39,(comprising) many from the first generations
  56,40,and many from the later ones
  56,41,And the People of the Left? How (wretched) are the People of the Left
  56,42,(They will be) in scorching wind and boiling water
  56,43,and in a shade of black smoke
  56,44,neither cool nor graceful
  56,45,They were earlier in luxuries
  56,46,and used to persist in major sins
  56,47,"and used to say, .Is it that when we die and become dust__is it that we will be raised again"
  56,48,and our ancient fathers as well
  56,49,"Say, .All the earlier and the later ones"
  56,50,will be gathered together for a fixed time of a specified Day
