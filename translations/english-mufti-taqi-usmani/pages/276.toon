quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  16,80,"Allah has made your houses a place of comfort for you, and made for you houses from the hides of cattle, which you find so light on the day you travel and the day you camp, and out of their wool and their fur and their hair (He created) furnishings and goods of enjoyment for a period of time"
  16,81,"Allah has made for your benefit shades from what He has created, and made for you shelters in the mountains, and made for you shirts that protect you from heat, and shirts that protect you in your battles. This is how He perfects His favor upon you, so that you may submit"
  16,82,"If they still turn away, then, your responsibility is only to convey the message clearly"

  16,86,"When the Mushriks (i.e. those who ascribe partners to Allah) will see those whom they made partners with Allah, they will say: .Our Lord, these are the partners we made whom we called in worship besides you. Then, they (the partners) will turn to them saying: .You are indeed liars"
  16,87,"On that day they will tender submission to Allah, and all that they used to fabricate will have vanished from them"
