  10,90,"And We let the children of Isra‘il cross the sea. So, Pharaoh and his troops chased them in transgression and hostility, until when he was about to drown, he said, .I believe that there is no god but the One in whom the children of Isra‘il believe, and I am among those who submit to Allah"
