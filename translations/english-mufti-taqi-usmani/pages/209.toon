quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  10,7,"As for those who do not believe in meeting Us and are quite happy with the life of this world and are content with it, and those who are heedless to Our signs"
  10,8,"they are the ones whose abode is the Fire, because of what they used to earn for themselves"
  10,9,"As for those who believe and do good deeds, their Lord will guide them by virtue of their belief; rivers will be flowing beneath them in the Gardens of Bliss"
  10,10,"Their call therein will be, .Pure are You, O Allah. and their greeting therein will be Salam . And the end of their call will be, .Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds"
  10,11,"And if Allah were to hasten in sending evil to the people, as they hasten in seeking good, their time would have been all over. So, We leave alone those who do not believe in meeting Us to wander blindly in their rebellion"
  10,12,"When man is afflicted by a hardship, he prays to Us (at all times), when reclining or sitting or standing. But when We remove his hardship, he just takes his way as though he had never prayed to Us in any hardship that afflicted him. This is how their deeds appear beautified to the transgressors"
  10,13,"Indeed We have destroyed generations before you when they transgressed, and their Messengers had come to them with clear signs, but they were not the ones who would believe. This is how We punish the guilty people"
