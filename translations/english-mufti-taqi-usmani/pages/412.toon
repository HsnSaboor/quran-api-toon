quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  31,12,"We gave wisdom to Luqman, and said, .Be grateful to Allah;. and whoever is grateful is, in fact, grateful for his own benefit, and whoever is ungrateful, then Allah is free of all needs, worthy of all praise"
  31,13,"(Remember) when Luqman said to his son, while he was advising him, .My dear son, do not ascribe partners to Allah. Indeed, ascribing partners to Allah (shirk) is grave transgression"
  31,14,"We commanded man (to be good) in respect of his parents. His mother carried him (in her womb) despite weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years. (We said to man,) .Be grateful to Me, and to your parents. To Me is the ultimate return"
  31,15,"However, if they force you to ascribe partners to Me about whom you (can) have no (source of) knowledge, then do not obey them. Remain with them in this world with due fairness, but follow the way of the one who has turned himself towards Me. Then, towards Me is your return, so I shall tell you what you had been doing"
  31,16,"(Luqman went on saying to his son,) .My dear son, in fact, if there be anything to the measure of a grain of rye, and it be (hidden) in a rock or in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth. Surely, Allah is All-Fine, All-Aware"
  31,17,"My dear son, establish Salah , and bid the Fair and forbid the Unfair, and observe patience on what befalls you. Surely, this is among the matters of determination"
  31,18,"and do not turn your cheek away from people, and do not walk on the earth haughtily. Surely, Allah does not like anyone who is arrogant, proud"
  31,19,"and be moderate in your walk, and lower your voice. Surely, the ugliest of voices is the voice of the donkeys"
