quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  8,62,"If they intend to deceive you, then, Allah is all-sufficient for you. He is the One who supported you with His help and with the believers"
  8,63,"and united their hearts. Had you spent all that is on earth, you could not have united their hearts. But Allah did unite their hearts. Surely, He is All-Mighty, All-Wise"
  8,64,"O Prophet, Allah is sufficient for you, and the believers who followed you"
  8,65,"O Prophet, rouse the believers to fighting. If there are twenty among you, who are patient, they will overcome two hundred; and if there are one hundred among you, they will overcome one thousand of those who disbelieve, because they are a people who do not understand"
  8,66,"Now Allah has lightened your burden, and He knew that there is weakness in you. So, if there are one hundred among you, who are patient, they will overcome two hundred; and if there are one thousand among you, they will overcome two thousand by the will of Allah. Allah is with the patient"
  8,67,"It is not befitting a prophet that he has captives with him unless he has subdued the enemy by shedding blood in the land. You intend to have the stuff of this world, while Allah intends the Hereafter (for you). And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise"
  8,68,"Had there not been a decree from Allah that came earlier, a great punishment would have overtaken you because of what you have taken"
  8,69,"So, eat of the spoils you have got, lawful and pure, and fear Allah. Surely, Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful"
