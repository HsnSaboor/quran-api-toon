quran[21]{c,v,t}:
  51,31,"He (Ibrahim) said (to the angels), .Then, what is your mission O messengers"
  51,32,"They said, .We are sent to a guilty people, (i.e. the people of Sodom)"
  51,33,so that we may send down upon them stones of clay
  51,34,marked by your Lord for the transgressors
  51,35,"So, We let the believers who were there to come out (from danger)"
  51,36,"but We did not find in it any Muslims, except one house"
  51,37,And We left in this (event) a sign (of deterrence) for those who fear the painful punishment
  51,38,"And (We left a similar sign) in (the story of) Musa, when We sent him to Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) with a clear proof"
  51,39,"So he turned away along with his chiefs and said, . (Musa is) a magician or a madman"
  51,40,"So We seized him and his army, and cast them into the sea, as he was of culpable behaviour"
  51,41,"And (a similar sign was left) in (the story of) ‘Ad, when We sent upon them the wind that was barren (from any benefit)"
  51,42,"it spared nothing it came upon, but rendered it like a stuff smashed by decay"
  51,43,"And (a similar sign was left) in (the story of) Thamud, when it was said to them, .Enjoy yourselves for a while"
  51,44,"Then they rebelled against the command of your Lord; so the thunderbolt (of divine punishment) seized them, while they were looking on"
  51,45,"Then they were neither able to stand (before the punishment), nor could they defend themselves"
  51,46,And (We have destroyed) the people of NuH even before; indeed they were a sinful people
  51,47,And the sky was built by Us with might; and indeed We are the expanders
  51,48,And the earth was spread out by Us as a floor; so how well have We spread it out
  51,49,"And from every thing We have created pairs of twos, so that you may heed"
  51,50,"So, flee to Allah. Indeed I am a plain warner sent by Him for you"
  51,51,And do not make up any other god along with Allah. Indeed I am a plain warner sent by Him for you
