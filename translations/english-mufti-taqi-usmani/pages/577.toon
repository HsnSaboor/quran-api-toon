quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  74,48,Then intercession of intercessors will not benefit them
  74,49,So what has happened to them that they are turning away from the Reminder
  74,50,as if they were wild donkeys
  74,51,fleeing from a lion
  74,52,"Rather, every one of them wishes that he should be given unrolled (divine) scriptures"
  74,53,Never! But they do not fear the Hereafter
  74,54,"Never! Indeed, this is a Reminder"
  74,55,"So, whoever so wishes may take advice from it"
  74,56,"And they will not take advice unless Allah so wills. He is worthy to be feared, and worthy to forgive"
  75,1,I swear by the Day of Resurrection
  75,2,"and I swear by the self-reproaching conscience, (that Resurrection is a reality)"
  75,3,Does man think that We will never reassemble his bones
  75,4,"Why (can We) not (do so), while We are able to reset (even) his fingertips perfectly"
  75,5,But man wishes to go on violating Allah‘s injunctions (even in future) ahead of him
  75,6,"He asks, .When will be this Day of Resurrection"
  75,7,"So, when the eyes will be dazzled"
  75,8,and the moon will lose its light
  75,9,and the sun and the moon will be joined together
  75,10,"on that day man will say, .Where to escape"
  75,11,Never! There will be no refuge at all
  75,12,"On that day, towards your Lord will be the destination (of everyone)"
  75,13,Man will be informed of what he sent ahead and what he left behind
  75,14,"Rather, man will be a witness against himself"
  75,15,even though he may offer his excuses
  75,16,"(O Prophet,) do not move your tongue (during revelation) for (reciting) it (the Qur‘an) to receive it in hurry"
  75,17,"It is surely undertaken by Us to store it (in your heart), and to let it be recited (by you after revelation is completed)"
  75,18,"Therefore, when it is recited by Us (through the angel), follow its recitation (by concentration of your heart)"
  75,19,"Then, it is undertaken by Us to explain it"
