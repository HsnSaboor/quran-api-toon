quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  18,21,"And in this way, We made them known to the people (of the city), so that they realize that Allah‘s promise is true, and that there is no doubt about the Hour (the Day of Resurrection). When they were disputing among themselves in their matter, they said, .Erect a building over them. Their Lord knows them best. Said those who prevailed in their matter, .We will certainly make a mosque over them"
  18,22,"Some will say, .(They were) three, the fourth of them being their dog,. and some will say, .Five, the sixth of them being their dog, just making conjectures. And others will say, .Seven, the eighth of them is their dog. Say, .My Lord knows best about their number. No one knows them except a few, so do not argue about them except an apparent argumentation. And do not ask anyone of these about them"
  18,23,"And never say about anything, .I will do this tomorrow"
  18,24,"unless (you say - ‘if) Allah wills.‘ And remember your Lord if you forget, and say (to those who asked you about the story of the People of the Cave), .May be, my Lord will lead me to something closer than this to guidance"
  18,25,They stayed in their Cave for three hundred years and added nine
  18,26,"Say, .Allah knows best how long they stayed. To Him belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth - how well He sees and how well He hears! They have no supporter other than Him and He lets no one share His authority"
  18,27,"And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord. There is no one to change His words, and you will never find a refuge beside Him"
