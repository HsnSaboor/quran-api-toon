quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  89,1,I swear by the dawn
  89,2,and by Ten Nights
  89,3,and by the even and the odd
  89,4,and by the night when it moves away
  89,5,Is there (not) in such an oath (enough assurance) for a man of sense
  89,6,Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with (the people) of ‘Ad
  89,7,"of Iram , the men of tall pillars"
  89,8,the like of whom were never created in the lands
  89,9,and (how He dealt) with (the people of) Thamud who had carved out the rocks in the Valley (of Qura)
  89,10,"and with Fir‘aun (Pharaoh), the man of the stakes"
  89,11,those who had rebelled in the cities
  89,12,and spread a lot of mischief therein
  89,13,"So, your Lord let loose on them the whip of torment"
  89,14,Surely your Lord is ever on the watch
  89,15,"As for man, when his Lord tests him, and thus gives him honour and bounties, he says, .My Lord has honoured me"
  89,16,"But when he tests him, and thus straitens his provision for him, he says, .My Lord has disgraced me"
  89,17,No! But you do not honour the orphan
  89,18,and do not encourage one another to feed the needy
  89,19,And you devour the inheritance with a sweeping gulp
  89,20,"and love wealth, an excessive love"
  89,21,No! When the earth will be crushed thoroughly to be turned into bits
  89,22,"and your Lord will come, and the angels as well, lined up in rows"
  89,23,"and Jahannam (Hell), on that day, will be brought forward, it will be the day when man will realize the truth, but from where will he take advantage of such realization"
