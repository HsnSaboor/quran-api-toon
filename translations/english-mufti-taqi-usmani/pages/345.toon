quran[17]{c,v,t}:
  23,43,"No community can go ahead of its appointed time, nor can they become late"
  23,44,"Thereafter, We sent Our messengers successively. Whenever its messenger came to a community, they rejected him. Then We made some of them follow others (in destruction) and turned them into tales (of history). So, away with a people who do not believe"
  23,45,"Thereafter, We sent Musa and his brother Harun with Our signs and a clear proof"
  23,46,towards Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his advisors. But they showed arrogance and they were haughty people
  23,47,"So they said, .shall we believe in two humans who are like ourselves and whose people are serving us as slaves"
  23,48,Thus they rejected both of them and were among the destroyed
  23,49,"And, of course, We gave Musa the Book, so that they may take the right path"
  23,50,"And We made the son of Maryam (Mary) and his mother a sign, and gave them shelter on a height, having a place of rest and running springs"
  23,51,"O messengers, eat from the good things, and act righteously. Of whatever you do, I am fully aware"
  23,52,"Surely, this is your creed, a single creed, and I am your Lord. So fear Me"
  23,53,"But they split up ways from one another (dividing themselves) into factions, each faction happy with what lies before it"
  23,54,So leave them in their negligence for some time
  23,55,Do they think that by consistently providing them with wealth and children
  23,56,"We are accelerating the (real) good things to them? The fact, however, is that they do not understand (the reality)"
  23,57,(Contrarily) those who are anxious out of awe of their Lord
  23,58,and those who believe in the verses of their Lord
  23,59,and those who do not associate any partner to their Lord
