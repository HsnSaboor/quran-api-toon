quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  7,188,"Say, .I have no power to bring a benefit or a harm to myself, except that which Allah wills. If I had the knowledge of the Unseen, I would have accumulated a lot of good things, and no evil would have ever touched me. I am but a warner, and a herald of good news for a people who believe"
  7,189,"He is the One who has created you from a single soul, and out of him created his wife, so that he may find comfort in her. So when he covers her with himself, she carries a light burden and moves about with it. Thereafter, when she grows heavy, they both pray to Allah, their Lord, .If You bless us with a perfect child, we shall be grateful"
  7,190,"But when We bless them with a perfect child, they ascribe partners to Him in what He blessed them with. Indeed Allah is much higher than what they associate with Him"
  7,191,"Do they associate those with Allah who do not create any thing, rather, they are created (themselves)"
  7,192,"And they (the alleged partners) cannot extend to them any help, nor can they help themselves"
  7,193,"If you call them to the right path, they will not follow you. It is all the same for them whether you call them or remain silent"
  7,194,"Surely, those whom you invoke beside Allah are slaves (of Allah) like you. So, call them, and they should respond to you if you are true"
  7,195,"Do they have legs to walk with? Or do they have hands to grasp with? Or do they have eyes to see with or do they have ears to hear with? Say, .Call to your associate-gods, then, plot against me and allow me no respite"
