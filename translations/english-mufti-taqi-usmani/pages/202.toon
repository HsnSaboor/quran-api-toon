quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  9,94,"They will make excuses to you when you return to them. Say, .Do not make excuses. We shall never believe you. Allah has told us the facts about you. Allah will see what you do, and His Messenger as well. Then you shall be returned to the Knower of the Seen and the Unseen, and He will tell you what you have been doing"
  9,95,"They will swear by Allah before you when you will go back to them, so that you may ignore their misdeeds. So, just ignore them. They are filth, and their abode is Jahannam, a recompense for what they used to do"
  9,96,"They swear before you, so that you may be pleased with them. So, even if you are pleased with them, Allah will not be pleased with the sinning people"
  9,97,"The Bedouins are often more strict in disbelief and hypocrisy, and are most likely to be ignorant of the limits of what Allah has sent down to His Messenger. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
  9,98,"And among the Bedouins there are those who take what they spend as a fine, and they look forward to the cycles of time to turn against you. Upon those is the evil cycle. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"
  9,99,"And among the Bedouins there are others who believe in Allah and in the Last Day and take what they spend as a source of nearness to Allah and of prayers from the Messenger. It is indeed a source of nearness for them. Allah will admit them to His mercy. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Very Merciful"
