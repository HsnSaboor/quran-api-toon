quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  63,5,"And when it is said to them, .Come on, so that Allah‘s Messenger may pray for your forgiveness., they twist their heads (in aversion), and you see them turning away in arrogance"
  63,6,"It is equal in their case, whether you (O prophet,) pray for their forgiveness or do not pray, Allah will never forgive them. Indeed Allah does not guide the sinning people"
  63,7,"They are those who say, .Do not spend on those who are with Allah‘s Messenger until they disperse. And to Allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not understand"
  63,8,"They say, .If we return to Madinah, the more honorable ones will drive out the meaner ones from there. And to Allah belongs the honour, and to His Messenger, and to the believers, but the hypocrites do not know"
  63,9,"O you who believe, your riches and your children must not divert you from the remembrance of Allah. And those who do that are the losers"
  63,10,"And spend out of what We have given to you before death overtakes one of you and he says, .My Lord, would you not give me respite to a near term, so that I should pay Sadaqah (alms) and become one of the righteous"
  63,11,"But Allah will never give respite to anyone, once his appointed time will come. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do"
