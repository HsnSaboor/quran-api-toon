  30,9,"Have they not traveled on earth to see how was the end of those before them? They were stronger than these in power, and they had tilled the land and had made it more populous than these have made it, and their messengers had come to them with clear proofs. So Allah was not such as could do injustice to them, but they used to do injustice to themselves"
  30,10,"Then the end of those who did evil was evil, because they rejected the verses of Allah and used to make mockery of them"

  30,13,"They will have no intercessors from among their (so-called) ‘partners of Allah‘, and they themselves will reject their (such) ‘partners‘"
  30,14,"And the day when the Hour (Qiyamah : the Day of Judgement)) will take place__it will be on that day that they will turn into separate groups"
  30,15,"Then, those who had believed and had done righteous deeds__they will be in a garden, extremely delighted"
