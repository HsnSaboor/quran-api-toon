  39,2,Surely We have revealed the Book to you with truth; so worship Allah making your submission exclusive for Him
  39,3,"Remember, Allah alone deserves the exclusive submission. As for those who have adopted guardians other than Him (saying), .We worship them for no other reason but because they would bring us near to Allah closely., Allah will judge between them in the matters in which they are differing.
