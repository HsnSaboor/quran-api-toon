quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  34,8,"Has he forged a lie against Allah, or is there a madness in him?. No, but those who do not believe in the Hereafter are in torment and far astray from the right path"
  34,9,"Have they not, then, looked to the sky and the earth that lies before them and behind them? If We so will, We would make the earth swallow them up, or cause pieces of the sky to fall upon them. Surely, in this there is a sign for a servant (of Allah) who turns to Him"
  34,10,"Surely We bestowed grace on Dawud from Us: .O mountains, pronounce with him Allah‘s purity repeatedly – and you too O birds!. And We made the iron soft for him"
  34,11,"(saying to him,) .Make coats of armour, and maintain balance in combining rings, and do, all of you, righteous deeds. Surely I am watchful of what you do"

Whoever of them would deviate from Our command, We would make him taste the punishment of the blazing fire"

So, when he fell down, the Jinns came to know that if they had the knowledge of the Unseen, they would not have stayed (so long) in the humiliating punishment"
