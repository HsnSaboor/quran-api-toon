quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,95,"Those among the believers who sit back, except the handicapped, are not equal to those who fight in the way of Allah with their riches and their lives. Allah has raised the rank of those who fight with their riches and their lives, over those who sit; and to each, Allah has promised good. Allah has given precedence to those who fight over those who sit in giving them a great reward"
  4,96,"— high ranks from Him and forgiveness and mercy. Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful"
  4,97,"Those whose souls the angels take while they had wronged themselves, the angels say (to them), .In what business were you (involved)?. They say, .We were oppressed in the earth. They say, .Was not the earth of Allah wide enough for you to emigrate to it?. Those people are such that their refuge is Jahannam . It is an evil place to return"
  4,98,"except the oppressed men and women and children, who cannot have means (to emigrate), nor can find a way"
  4,99,"As for such, it is likely that Allah would pardon them. Allah is Most-Pardoning, Most-Forgiving"
  4,100,"Whoever migrates in the way of Allah shall find on the earth many a place to settle, and a wide dimension (of resources). Whoever leaves his home migrating for the sake of Allah and His Messenger, and death overtakes him, then, his reward is established with Allah. Allah is Most- Forgiving, Very-Merciful"
  4,101,"When you travel on the earth, there is no sin on you in shortening your Salah, if you fear that the disbelievers would put you in trouble. Surely, the disbelievers are an open enemy for you"
