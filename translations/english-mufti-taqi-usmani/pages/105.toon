quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  4,171,"O people of the Book, be not excessive in your Faith, and do not say about Allah anything but the truth. The Masih 'Isa, the son of Maryam, is only a Messenger of Allah, and His Word that He had delivered to Maryam, and a spirit from Him. So, believe in Allah and His Messengers. Do not say \"Three\". Stop it. That is good for you. Allah is the only One God. He is far too pure to have a son. To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. And Allah is enough to trust in"
  4,172,"The Masih shall never spurn to be a slave of Allah, nor shall the angels who are stationed near to Him. And whoever spurns to worship Him, and shows arrogance, ___then, He shall gather all of them before Himself"
  4,173,"As for those who believe and do good deeds, He shall give them their reward in full, and give them more out of His grace. But, to those who spurn and show arroagance, He shall give a painful punishment, and they shall find for themselves neither a friend other than Allah, nor a helper"
  4,174,"O people, a proof has come to you from you Lord, and We have sent down to you a vivid light"
  4,175,"Now those who believe in Allah and hold on to Him - He shall admit them into Mercy from Him, and Grace, and shall lead to Himself through a straight path"
