quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,60,"Have you not seen those who claim that they have believed in what was revealed to you and what was revealed before you? They want to take their disputes to the Taghut, while they were ordered to reject it. Satan wants to mislead them to a remote wrong way"
  4,61,"When it is said to them, .Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Messenger,. you will see the hypocrites turning away from you in aversion"
  4,62,"But, how (apologetic) they are when they suffer a calamity because of the acts of their own hands, and they come to you swearing by Allah, .We meant nothing but to promote good and bring about harmony"
  4,63,"Those are the ones Allah knows what is in their hearts. So, ignore them, and give them good counsel, and speak to them about themselves in appealing words"
  4,64,"We did not send any Messenger but to be obeyed by the leave of Allah. Had they, after having wronged themselves, come to you and sought forgiveness from Allah, and had the Messenger prayed for their forgiveness, they would certainly have found Allah Most-Relenting, Very- Merciful"
  4,65,"So, never by your Lord! Never shall they become believers, unless they make you the judge in the disputes that arise between them, then find no discomfort in their hearts against what you have decided, and surrender to it in total submission"
