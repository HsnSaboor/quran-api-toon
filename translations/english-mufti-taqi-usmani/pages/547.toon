quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  59,10,"And (fai‘ is also) for those who came after them saying, .Our Lord, forgive us and those of our brothers who preceded us in faith, and do not place in our hearts any rancor against those who believe; Surely, Our Lord, you are Very-Kind, Very-Merciful"
  59,11,"Did you not see the hypocrites saying to their brothers from those of the people of the Book who are unbelievers, .If you are expelled, we will certainly go out with you, and we will never obey anyone about you. And if you are fought against, we will definitely help you. Allah bears witness that they are pure liars"
  59,12,"If they are expelled, they will not go out with them, and if they are fought against, they will not help them. And even if they help them, they will surely turn their backs, then they will not be helped"
  59,13,"In fact, your fear in their hearts is greater than (that of) Allah. That is because they are a people who do not understand"
  59,14,"They do not fight you, even assembled together, but in fortified towns, or from behind the walls. Their quarrelling between themselves is severe. You think that they are united, while their hearts are divided. That is because they are a people who have no sense"
  59,15,"The example (of Banu NaDir) is like those who were before them in near past, who tasted the evil consequence of their conduct, and for them (in the Hereafter) there is a painful punishment"
  59,16,"The example (of the hypocrites) is like the ShaiTan when he says to a human being, .Become disbeliever. then once he disbelieves, he says, .I disown you; I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds"
