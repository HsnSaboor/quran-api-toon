quran[14]{c,v,t}:
  20,38,when We revealed to your mother what was to be revealed
  20,39,"that is, ‘Put him (the baby) in the chest, then cast it into the river, then let the river throw it by the shore, and it will be picked up by one who is enemy to Me and enemy to him.‘ And I had cast love on you from Myself (so that you might be favourite of all), and that you might be brought up under My eye"
  20,40,"(Remember) when your sister was going (to the family of Pharaoh) and was saying, ‘Shall I lead you to one who nurses him?‘ Thus We brought you back to your mother, so that her eyes might have comfort and she might not grieve. And you had killed a person, then We brought you out of the trouble; and We tested you with a great ordeal. Then you lived a number of years amidst the people of Madyan. After all this, you came O Musa, to a destined point of time"

  20,47,"So, come to him and say, ‘We are the messengers of your Lord. So, let the children of Isra‘il go with us, and do not persecute them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord; and peace be upon the one who follows the guidance"
  20,48,"Verily, it has been revealed to us that the punishment is for the one who denies and turns away.‘"
