quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  46,6,"and when people will be assembled (on the Day of Judgment), they will be enemies to them, and will refuse even their having worshipped them"
  46,7,"When Our verses are recited to them in all their clarity, the disbelievers say about the truth when it comes to them, .This is an open magic"
  46,8,"Is it that they say, .He has forged it (the Qur‘an).? Say, .If I have forged it, then you do not have any power to help me against Allah. He is well aware of what you are engaged in. He is enough as a witness between me and you, and He is the Most-Forgiving, the Very-Merciful"
  46,9,"Say, .I am not something unprecedented among the messengers, and I do not know what will be done to me or to you. I do not follow anything but what is revealed to me, and I am only a clear warner"
  46,10,"Say, .Tell me, If it (the Qur‘an) is from Allah and you reject it, and a witness from the children of Isra‘il testifies about something similar to it and comes to believe (in it), while you persist in your arrogance, (then, how unjust you are!) Surely, Allah does not give guidance to the unjust people"
  46,11,"The disbelievers say about the believers, .Had it (Islamic faith) been a good thing, these (weak and poor) people would not have preceded us (in proceeding) towards it. Since they did not accept guidance through it (the Qur‘an), they will say, .This is a classical lie"
  46,12,"And before this there was the Book of Musa, a guide and a mercy. And this is a Book confirming (it) in Arabic tongue, so that it may warn the wrongdoers and give good news to those who are good in their deeds"
  46,13,"Surely, those who say, .Our Lord is Allah. and then stay firm, they will have no fear, nor shall they grieve"
  46,14,"Those are the people of Paradise, who will live there for ever as a reward for what they used to do"
