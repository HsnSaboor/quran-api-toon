quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  24,54,"Say, .Obey Allah and obey the messenger. But if you turn away, then on him (the messenger) lies (the responsibility of) what he is burdened with, and on you lies (the responsibility of) what you are burdened with. And if you obey him, you will get the right path. The duty of the Messenger is no more than to convey the message clearly"
  24,55,"Allah has promised those of you who believe and do good deeds that He will certainly make them (His) vicegerents in the land, as He made those before them, and will certainly establish for them their religion which He has chosen for them, and will certainly give them peace in place of fear in which they were before; (provided that) they worship Me, ascribing no partner to Me. And those who turn infidel after that are the transgressors"
  24,56,"Establish Salah and pay Zakah and obey the messenger, so that you may be favored with mercy"
  24,57,Never think that the disbelievers are (able) to frustrate (Allah‘s plan) on the earth. Their abode is the Fire. Indeed it is an evil terminus
  24,58,"O you who believe, the slaves owned by you, and those of you who have not reached puberty, must seek your permission (to see you) at three times: before the prayer of Fajr, and when you take off your clothes at noon, and after the prayer of ‘Isha‘. These are three times of privacy for you. There is no harm, neither to you nor to them, after these (three times). They are your frequent visitors, as some of you are (frequent visitors) of the others. This is how Allah explains the verses to you. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"
