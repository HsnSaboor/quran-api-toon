quran[13]{c,v,t}:
  72,1,"Say, .It has been revealed to me that a group from Jinn has listened (to the Qur‘an), and said (to their people), ‘Indeed we have heard an amazing Recital (Qur‘an)"
  72,2,"that guides to the right way, so we have believed in it, and we will never associate a partner with our Lord.‘"
  72,3,"and (then the Jinns started talking to each other) that exalted is the Glory of our Lord; He has taken neither a wife, nor a son"
  72,4,and that the fools among us used to attribute to Allah extremely absurd things
  72,5,"and that we thought that the humans and the Jinn would never tell a lie about Allah, (therefore, we had followed them in shirk under this impression)"
  72,6,"and that some guys from human beings used to seek refuge with some guys of the Jinn, and thus they increased them (the Jinns) in arrogance"
  72,7,and that they (humans) thought as you (O Jinns) thought that Allah will never resurrect anyone
  72,8,"and that we sought (to reach) the sky, but we found it filled with stern guards and flames"
  72,9,"and that we used to sit at places therein to listen; but if one will (try to) listen now, he will find a flame in ambush for him"
  72,10,"and that we do not know whether it is a bad end that is intended for those on earth, or their Lord has intended for them a right thing"
  72,11,"and that some of us are (already) righteous, and some of us are otherwise, and we were on different ways"
  72,12,"and that we have now believed that we can never frustrate Allah on the earth, nor can we baffle Him by escape"
  72,13,"and that when we heard the Guiding Discourse, we believed in it; so if one believes in his Lord, he will have no fear of either any curtailment (in his reward) or any excess (in his punishment)"
