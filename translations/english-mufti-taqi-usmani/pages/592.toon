quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  87,16,But you prefer the worldly life
  87,17,while the Hereafter is much better and much more durable
  87,18,Indeed this is (written) in the earlier divine scripts
  87,19,the scripts of Ibrahim and Musa
  88,1,Has there come to you the description of the Overwhelming Event
  88,2,Many faces that day will be humbled
  88,3,"laboring, exhausted"
  88,4,They will enter into the scorching fire
  88,5,They will be made to drink water from a boiling spring
  88,6,There will be no food for them except from a thorny plant
  88,7,"that will neither nourish, nor satisfy hunger"
  88,8,Many faces that day will be full of glamour
  88,9,well pleased with their endeavor
  88,10,in a lofty garden
  88,11,in which they will not hear any absurd talk
  88,12,In it there is a flowing spring
  88,13,In it there are elevated couches
  88,14,"and goblets, well placed"
  88,15,"and cushions, arrayed"
  88,16,"and carpets, spread around"
  88,17,"So, do they not look at the camels how they are created"
  88,18,"and at the sky, how it is raised high"
  88,19,"and at the mountains, how they are installed"
  88,20,"and at the earth, how it is spread out"
  88,21,"So, (O Prophet,) keep on preaching; you are only a preacher"
  88,22,You are not a taskmaster set up over them
  88,23,but whoever turns away and disbelieves
  88,24,Allah will punish him with the greatest torment
  88,25,Surely towards Us they have to return
  88,26,then it is Our job to call them to account
