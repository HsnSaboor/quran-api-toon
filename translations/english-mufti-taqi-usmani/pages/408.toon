quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  30,33,"When the people are visited by some affliction, they invoke their Lord with exclusive concentration on Him. Then once He gives them a taste of His mercy, a group of them starts at once ascribing partners to their Lord"
  30,34,so as to become ungrateful for what We gave to them. So enjoy yourselves awhile; then you will soon come to know
  30,35,Is it that We have sent down to them any authority that speaks to them about their associating partners with Him
  30,36,"When We give people a taste of mercy, they are happy with it, and if they are touched by an evil because of what their hands sent ahead, they are at once in despair"
  30,37,"Did they not see that Allah extends provision to whomsoever He wills, and straitens (it for whomsoever He wills)? Surely in this there are signs for a people who believe"
  30,38,"So give to the kinsman his right, and to the needy and the wayfarer. That is better for those who seek Allah‘s pleasure, and it is they who will be successful"
  30,39,"Whatever Riba (increased amount) you give, so that it may increase in the wealth of the people, it does not increase with Allah; and whatever Zakah you give, seeking Allah‘s pleasure with it, (it is multiplied by Allah, and) it is such people who multiply (their wealth in real terms)"
  30,40,"Allah is the One who created you, then gave sustenance to you, then He will make you dead, then He will make you alive. Is there any one from your (so-called) ‘partners of God‘ who can do anything of that (kind)? Pure is He, and far higher than what they associate (with Him)"
  30,41,"Calamities have appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of the people have earned, so that He (Allah) makes them taste some of what they did, in order that they may return (to the right way)"
