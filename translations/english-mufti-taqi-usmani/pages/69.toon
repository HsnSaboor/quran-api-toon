  3,150,"Instead, Allah is your Lord, and He is the best of all helpers"
  3,151,"We shall put awe into the hearts of those who disbelieve, since they have associated with Allah something for which He has not sent any authority. Their ultimate place is the Fire; and evil is the abode of the unjust"
  3,152,"Allah has surely fulfilled His promise to you when you, with His will, were killing them off, until you showed weakness and disputed in the matter and disobeyed after He had shown you what you liked.

Of course, He has forgiven you. Allah is All-Gracious to the believers"
  3,153,"When you were going away, not even turning to look at anyone, and the Messenger was calling you from behind you. He awarded you sorrow for sorrow, so that you should not grieve (in future) over what you lost, or for what you suffered. Allah is All-Aware of what you do"
