quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  40,26,"And Pharaoh said, .Let me kill Musa, and let him call his Lord. I am afraid that he will change your religion or he will cause havoc to appear in the land"
  40,27,"And Musa said, .I have sought protection of my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant man who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning"
  40,28,"And said a believing man from the House of Pharaoh who had kept his faith secret, .Would you kill a man because he says – ‘Allah is my Lord‘ – while he has come to you with clear signs from your Lord? If he is a liar, his lie will fall back on himself, and if he is truthful, some of that (punishment) of which he warns you will afflict you. Indeed, Allah does not give guidance to anyone who is transgressor, a liar"
  40,29,"O my people, the kingdom is yours today, while you are dominant on the land. But, who is going to help us against Allah‘s punishment, if it comes upon us?. Pharaoh said, .I do not give you an opinion unless I myself believe it to be correct, and I do not direct you to anything but to the right way"
  40,30,"Said he who had believed, .I fear for you something like a day of the (disbelieving) groups (of the past)"
  40,31,like the fate of the people of NuH and ‘Ad and Thamud and those who were after them – and Allah does not intend to do any injustice to His servants
  40,32,"And O my people, I fear for you a day in which people will call one another"
  40,33,"a day when you will turn back on your heels, having no one to save you from Allah – but, whomever Allah lets go astray, for him there is no one to guide"
