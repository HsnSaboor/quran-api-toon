quran[8]{c,v,t}:
  2,17,"Their situation is like that of a man who kindles a fire, and when it illuminates everything around him, Allah takes away their lights and leaves them in layers of darkness, so that they see nothing"
  2,18,"Deaf, dumb and blind, they shall not return"
  2,19,"Or (it is) like a rainstorm from the sky, bringing darkness, thunder and lightning; they thrust their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps for fear of death, - and Allah encompasses the disbelievers"
  2,20,"and lightning (all but) snatches away their eyesight; every time a flash gives them light, they walk by it; and when darkness falls upon them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He would certainly take away their hearing and their eyes: surely Allah is powerful to do anything"
  2,21,"O people, worship your Lord who created you and those before you, so that you may become God-fearing"
  2,22,"He is the One who made the earth a bed for you, and the sky a roof, and sent down water from the sky, then brought forth with it fruits, as a provision for you. So, do not set up parallels to Allah when you know"
  2,23,"If you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then bring a Surah similar to this, and do call your supporters other than Allah, if you are true"
  2,24,"But if you do not – and you will never be able to – then guard yourselves against the Fire, the fuel of which will be men and stones. It has been prepared for disbelievers"
