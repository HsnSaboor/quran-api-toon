quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  26,84,and destine for me a truthful description among the next generations
  26,85,and make me among those who will inherit the Garden of Bliss
  26,86,and forgive my father. Indeed he was one of those who went astray
  26,87,and do not put me to disgrace on the Day when all will be raised to life
  26,88,the Day when neither wealth will be of any use (to any one) nor sons
  26,89,except to him who will come to Allah with a sound heart
  26,90,and the Paradise will be brought near to the God-fearing
  26,91,and the Hell will be fully uncovered for the perverse
  26,92,"and it will be said to them, ‘Where is that which you used to worship"
  26,93,beside Allah? Can they help you or help themselves?‘
  26,94,So they (their false gods) will be thrown on their faces into it - they and the erring people
  26,95,"and the entire army of Iblis (Satan), all together"
  26,96,They will say when they will be quarreling there with each other
  26,97,NAME
  26,98,when we used to equate you with the Lord of the worlds
  26,99,and it is only the sinners who misguided us
  26,100,Now we have neither any intercessors
  26,101,nor any true friend
  26,102,Would that we have a chance to return whereby we may join the believers!‘
  26,103,"Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers"
  26,104,"and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful"
  26,105,The people of NuH rejected the messengers
  26,106,"when their brother NuH said to them, .Do you not fear Allah"
  26,107,I am an honest messenger for you
  26,108,"So, fear Allah and obey me"
  26,109,I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is with none but with the Lord of the worlds
  26,110,"so, fear Allah and obey me"
  26,111,"They said, .Shall we believe in you while you are followed by the lowest people"
