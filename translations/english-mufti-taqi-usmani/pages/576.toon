quran[30]{c,v,t}:
  74,18,He pondered and surmised
  74,19,Death onto him! How (bad) is the surmise he put forward
  74,20,"Again, death unto him! How (bad) is the surmise he put forward"
  74,21,Then he looked (to those around him)
  74,22,then he frowned and scowled
  74,23,"then turned his back, and waxed proud"
  74,24,"then said, .This is nothing but traditional magic"
  74,25,this is nothing but saying of a mortal
  74,26,I will put him into Saqar (Hell)
  74,27,And what can let you know what Saqar is
  74,28,It neither spares (anything inside it from burning) nor leaves (any disbeliever outside)
  74,29,It will disfigure the skins
  74,30,Appointed on it are nineteen (wardens)
  74,31,"And We did not make wardens of the Fire but (from) angels, and did not fix their number but as a test for those who disbelieve, so that those who are given the Book may come to believe, and those who believe may improve in belief, and so that those who are given the Book and those who believe may not doubt (its correctness), and so that those having malady in their hearts and the disbelievers say, .What has Allah meant by this strange statement?. Thus Allah lets go astray whomever He wills, and leads to the right path whomever He wills. And no one knows the hosts of your Lord but He. And this is nothing else but a reminder for mankind"
  74,32,"Truly, I swear by the moon"
  74,33,and by the night when it goes back
  74,34,and by the morning when it becomes bright
  74,35,"it (Saqar : Hell) is one of the greatest things"
  74,36,as a warning to the mankind
  74,37,to the one from among you who wishes to come forward (towards good deeds) or to go back (from them)
  74,38,Everyone will be detained (in the Hell) because of what he did
  74,39,"except the People of the Right, (i.e. those who will be given their Book of Deeds in their right hands)"
  74,40,"who will be in gardens, asking"
  74,41,about the guilty persons
  74,42,What has brought you to Saqar? (Hell)
  74,43,"They will say, .We were not among those who offered Salah , (obligatory prayer)"
  74,44,and we did not give food to the needy
  74,45,and we indulged (in mocking at the truth) along with those who indulged
  74,46,and we used to deny the Day of Requital
  74,47,until when we were overtaken by that which is certain
