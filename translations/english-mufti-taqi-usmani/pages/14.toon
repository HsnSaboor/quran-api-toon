quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,89,"And when there came to them a Book from Allah, which confirms what was with them,__ while earlier, they used to seek help against those who disbelieved, __ yet when there came to them that which they did recognize, they denied it. So the curse of Allah is upon the disbelievers"
  2,90,"Vile is that for which they have sold out their selves: that they should deny what Allah has revealed, grudging that Allah should send down some of His bounty to whomsoever He wills from among His servants. So, they came out with wrath upon wrath. And for the unbelievers, there is humiliating punishment"
  2,91,"When it is said to them, .Believe in what Allah has revealed,. they say, .We believe in what has been revealed to us. — and they deny what is beyond it, whereas that is the truth which confirms what is with them. Say, .Why then have you been slaying the prophets of Allah earlier, if you were believers"
  2,92,"And certainly Musa came to you with clear signs, then you adopted the calf (as god) after his departure (to the mount of Tur) — and you were transgressors"
  2,93,"And when We took a pledge from you, and raised high the (mount of) Tur above you: .Hold fast to what We have given you, and listen.! They said, .We have heard and disobeyed. And, on account of their denial, they were soaked with love for the calf in their hearts. Say: .Evil is that which your faith enjoins upon you, if you are believers"
