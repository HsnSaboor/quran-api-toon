quran[11]{c,v,t}:
  28,60,"Moreover, whatever of anything you are given is (no more than) an enjoyment of the worldly life and its decoration, and that which lies with Allah is much better and far more lasting. So do you not use reason"
  28,61,"Is then the one, to whom We have made a good promise which he is going to meet, like the one whom We have given the benefit of enjoying the worldly life, then on the Day of Judgment he will be among those arraigned"
  28,62,"(Remember) the Day when He will call them and say, .Where are My ‘partners‘ you used to claim"
  28,63,"Those against whom the word will come true will say, .Our Lord, these are the ones whom we led astray. We led them astray as we ourselves went astray. We negate before you our responsibility (in respect of them); it was not we whom they worshipped"
  28,64,"And it will be said, .Call those whom you held as co-gods. So they will call them, but they will not respond to them, and they will see the punishment. Would that they had taken the right path"
  28,65,"(Remember) the Day when He (Allah) will call them and say, .What response did you give to the messengers"
  28,66,"So all events will become too obscure for them (to give a correct reply), and they will not (be able to) consult each other"
  28,67,"As for the one who repents and becomes a believer and acts righteously, hopefully he will be among the successful"
  28,68,Your Lord creates what He wills and chooses. Choice is not theirs. Pure is Allah and far higher than their ascribing of partners to Him
  28,69,Your Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they reveal
  28,70,"And He is Allah. There is no god but He. Praise is only for Him in the beginning and at the end, and He alone has the right to judge, and to Him you are to be returned"
