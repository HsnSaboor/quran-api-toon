quran[28]{c,v,t}:
  69,35,"So, he has no friend here today"
  69,36,nor any food except that which comes out from wounds when washing
  69,37,which is eaten by none but the sinners
  69,38,I swear by what you see
  69,39,and what you do not see
  69,40,"it is surely the speech of a noble Messenger, (that he conveys from Allah)"
  69,41,"and it is not the speech of a poet, (but) little you believe"
  69,42,"nor is it the speech of a soothsayer, (but) little you heed to the advice"
  69,43,It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
  69,44,Had he (the prophet) forged some statements in Our name
  69,45,We would have certainly seized him by the right hand
  69,46,and then severed his life-artery
  69,47,and none of you could have saved him from it
  69,48,It is infact a Reminder for the God-fearing
  69,49,"And, of course, We know that among you there are deniers"
  69,50,"And surely, it is a cause of remorse for the disbelievers"
  69,51,And it is surely an absolute truth
  69,52,"So, pronounce the purity of the name of your magnificent Lord"
  70,1,A demanding person has asked for the punishment that is going to befall
  70,2,the disbelievers; there is no one to avert it
  70,3,"(and it will come) from Allah, the Lord of the stairways"
  70,4,to whom ascend the angels and the Spirit in a day the length of which is fifty thousand years
  70,5,"So, observe patience, a good patience"
  70,6,They see it far off
  70,7,and We see it near
  70,8,(This punishment will befall) on the Day when the sky will be like dregs of oil
  70,9,and the mountains will be like dyed wool
  70,10,and no friend will ask about any friend
