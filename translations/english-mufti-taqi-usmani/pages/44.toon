quran[5]{c,v,t}:
  2,260,"(Remember) when Ibrahim said: .My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead. He said: .Is it that you do not believe?‘‘ He said: .Of course, I do, but it is just to make my heart at peace.‘‘ He said: .Then take four birds and tame them to your call, then put on every mountain a part from them, then give them a call, and they shall come to you rushing, and know that Allah is Mighty, Wise.‘‘"
  2,261,"The example of those who spend in the way of Allah is just like a grain that produced seven ears, each ear having a hundred grains, and Allah multiplies (the reward) for whom He wills. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing"
  2,262,"Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, then do not make their spending followed by boasting about favour, or with causing hurt,__ they have their reward with their Lord and there is no fear for them nor shall they grieve"
  2,263,"A graceful word and forgiving is better than charity followed by causing hurt. Allah is All-Independent, Forbearing"
  2,264,"O you who believe, do not nullify your acts of charity by boasting about (doing people a) favour and by causing (them) hurt, like the one who spends his wealth to show off before people and does not believe in Allah and in the Last Day. So, his example is like a rock on which there is dust, then a heavy rain came over it and left it barren. They have no ability to gain anything out of what they have done, and Allah does not give guidance to the people who disbelieve"
