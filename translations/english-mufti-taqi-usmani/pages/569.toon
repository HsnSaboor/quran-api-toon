quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  70,11,(though) they will be made to see each other. A guilty person will desire that he may be able to ransom himself from the torment of that day even by his sons
  70,12,and his wife and his brother
  70,13,and his kindred that sheltered him
  70,14,"and all those on earth, then he may redeem himself"
  70,15,By no means! It is the flaming fire
  70,16,that will pull out the skin of the scalp
  70,17,It will call him who had turned his back and fled away (from the truth)
  70,18,and accumulated (wealth) and hoarded (it)
  70,19,Indeed man is created weak in courage
  70,20,very upset when touched by evil
  70,21,and very niggard when visited by good (fortune)
  70,22,except the performers of Salah
  70,23,who are regular in their Salah
  70,24,and those in whose riches there is a specified right
  70,25,for the one who asks and the one who is deprived
  70,26,and those who believe in the Day of Judgment as true
  70,27,and those who are fearful of the torment of their Lord
  70,28,Indeed the torment of their Lord is not something to be fearless from
  70,29,and those who guard their private parts
  70,30,"except from their wives and those (slave-girls) owned by their hands,__ because they are not to be blamed"
  70,31,"but the one who seeks (sexual gratification) beyond that, then such people are the transgressors"
  70,32,and those who are careful about their trusts and covenants
  70,33,and those who are upright in their testimonies
  70,34,and those who take due care of their Salah
  70,35,Those will be honoured in gardens (of Jannah)
  70,36,So what has happened to those who disbelieve that they are rushing towards you
  70,37,"from the right and from the left, in groups"
  70,38,Does every one of them aspire to be admitted to the garden of bliss
  70,39,By no means! We have created them from what they know
