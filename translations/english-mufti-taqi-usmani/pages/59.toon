quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  3,71,"O People of the Book, why do you confound the truth with falsehood, and conceal the truth when you know (the reality)"
  3,72,"And a group from the people of the Book said (to their people), .Believe in what has been revealed to the believers in the early part of the day, and disbelieve at the end of it, so that they may turn back"
  3,73,"But do not believe (for real) except in those who follow your faith. Say, .(Real) guidance is the guidance of Allah. (But all that you do is due to your envy) that someone is given what is similar to that which you have been given, or that they argue against you before your Lord. Say, .The bounty is in the hands of Allah. He gives it to whom He wills. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing"
  3,74,He chooses for His grace whom He wills. Allah is the Lord of great bounty
  3,75,"Among the people of the Book there is one who, if you entrust him with a heap (of gold or silver), will give it back to you; and among them there is one who, if you entrust him with a single dinar (a coin of gold), he will not give it back to you, unless you keep standing over him. This is because they have said, .There is no way we can be blamed in the matter of the unlettered.And they tell lies about Allah knowingly"
  3,76,"Why (will they) not (be blamed)? Whoever fulfils his pledge and fears Allah, then, Allah loves the God-fearing"
  3,77,"Surely, those who take a small price by (breaking) the covenant of Allah and their oaths, for them there is no share in the Hereafter, and Allah will neither speak to them, nor will He look towards them on the Day of Judgment, nor will He purify them. For them there is a painful punishment"
