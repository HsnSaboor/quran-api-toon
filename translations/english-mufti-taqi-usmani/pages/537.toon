quran[23]{c,v,t}:
  56,77,it is surely the Noble Qur‘an
  56,78,(recorded already) in a protected book (i.e. the Preserved Tablet)
  56,79,that is not touched except by the purified ones (the angels)
  56,80,a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
  56,81,Is it this discourse that you take lightly
  56,82,and take your denial as your livelihood
  56,83,So why (do you) not (intervene) when the soul (of a dying person) reaches the throat
  56,84,and you are watching
  56,85,"And We are closer to him than you, but you do not perceive"
  56,86,"So, if you are not going to be recompensed (in the Hereafter for your deeds), then why do you not"
  56,87,"bring the soul back, if you are truthful"
  56,88,"So, in case he (the dying person) is from among those blessed with nearness"
  56,89,then (for him) there is comfort and fragrance and garden of bliss
  56,90,And in case he is from among the People of the Right
  56,91,"then, (it will be said to him,) .Peace is for you, as you are one of the People of the Right"
  56,92,"But if he is one of the deniers, the astray"
  56,93,then (for him) there is entertainment from boiling water
  56,94,and burning in the Hell
  56,95,Indeed this is certainty in its true sense
  56,96,"So, proclaim purity of the name of your Lord, the Magnificent"
  57,1,"All that is in the heavens and the earth proclaims Allah‘s purity, and He is the Mighty, the Wise"
  57,2,"To Him belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and brings death, and He is Powerful to do any thing"
  57,3,"He is the First and the Last, and the Manifest and the Hidden, and He is All-Knowing about every thing"
