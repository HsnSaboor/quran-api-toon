quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  28,44,"And (O prophet,) you were not there at the Western side (of the mount Tur) when We delegated the matter to Musa, nor were you among those present"
  28,45,"but We created generations (after him) and a long time passed over them. And you were not dwelling among the people of Madyan, reciting Our verses to them, but it is We who do send messengers"
  28,46,"And you were not at the side of (the mount) Tur when We called (Musa), but it (your prophet-hood through which you knew all this) is a mercy from your Lord, so that you warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, that they may receive the advice"
  28,47,"And (We have sent you as a messenger) lest, in case they suffered a calamity because of what their hands sent ahead, they should say, .Our Lord, why did You not send a messenger to us, so that we might have followed your verses and been among the believers"
  28,48,"But when the Truth came to them from Us, they said, .Why has he (the messenger) not been given (a book) similar to what Musa had been given?. Is it not that they denied what Musa had been given before? They said, .Both (Qur‘an and Torah) are works of magic that support each other. And they said, .We disbelieve each one of them"
  28,49,"Say, .Then bring a book from Allah which is better than both, in guidance, and I shall follow it, if you are true"
  28,50,"So if they do not respond to you, be sure that they are only following their desires. And who is more astray than the one who follows his desire without guidance from Allah. Surely Allah does not take the wrongdoing people onto the right path"
