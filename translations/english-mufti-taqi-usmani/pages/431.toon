quran[9]{c,v,t}:
  34,23,"Intercession before Him is of no benefit, but for the one whom He has permitted. (And those who receive a command from Allah remain fearful) until when fear is removed from their hearts, they say (to each other), .What did your Lord say?. They say, .The Truth. He is the High, the Great"
  34,24,"Say, .Who gives you sustenance from the heavens and the earth?. Say, .Allah. And We or you are either on the right path or in open error"
  34,25,"Say, .You will not be asked about the sins we committed, and we will not be asked about what you do"
  34,26,"Say, .Our Lord will assemble us together, then will judge between us with truth. He is the best Judge, the All-Knowing"
  34,27,"Say, .Show me the ones whom you have associated with Him as partners. Never! (You can never produce such partners.) He is but Allah, the Mighty, the Wise"
  34,28,"Even if you do not find anyone in them, do not enter therein until permission is given to you. And if it is said to you, ‘Go back‘, just go back; it is more decent for you. Allah is All-Aware of what you do"
  34,29,"They say, . When will this promise (of the Day of Judgment) be fulfilled, if you are truthful"
  34,30,"Say, .You hold an appointment for a day that you can neither put back for a while, nor can you put it forward"
  34,31,"Those who disbelieve say, .We will never believe in this Qur‘an, nor in that which was before it. But if only you could see when the wrongdoers will be made to stand before their Lord, repulsing words (of blame) to one another! Those who were held as weak will say to the overbearing, .Had you not been there, we would have been believers"
