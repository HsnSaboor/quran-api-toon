quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  11,6,There is no creature on earth whose sustenance is not undertaken by Allah. He knows its permanent and its temporary place. Everything is in a clear book
  11,7,"He is the One who created the heavens and the earth in six days, while His throne was on water, so that He might test you as to who among you is better in deed. And if you say, .You shall be raised after death,. the disbelievers will surely say, .This is nothing but sheer magic"
  11,8,"And if We defer the punishment for them for a certain time, they will say, .What is holding it back?. Beware, the day it will visit them, it shall not be turned back from them, and they shall be besieged by what they used to ridicule"
  11,9,"If We give man a taste of Our mercy and then take it away from him, he becomes highly desperate, utterly ungrateful"
  11,10,"And if We give him a taste of comfort after a hardship has touched him, he will say, .Evils have gone away from me., (and thus) He will become over-exulting, boastful"
  11,11,except those who are patient and do good deeds. Such people will have Allah‘s forgiveness and a great reward
  11,12,"Is it then possible from you (O Prophet,) that you will abandon some of what is being revealed to you, and that your heart will be straitened thereby, because they say, .Why has a treasure not been sent down to him or an angel not come with him?. You are but a warner. And Allah takes care of everything"
