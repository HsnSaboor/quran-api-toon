quran[6]{c,v,t}:
  4,1,"O men, fear your Lord who created you from a single soul, and from it created its match, and spread many men and women from the two.

  4,4,"Give women their dower in good cheer. Then, if they forego some of it, of their own will, you may have it as pleasant and joyful"
  4,5,"Do not give the feeble-minded your property that Allah has made a means of support for you, and do feed them from it, and clothe them, and speak to them in fair words"
  4,6,"Test the orphans until they reach the marriageable age. Then, if you perceive in them proper understanding, hand their property over to them, and do not consume it extravagantly and hastily, lest they should grow up.

So, when you hand their property over to them, make witnesses upon them. Allah is sufficient for reckoning"
