quran[31]{c,v,t}:
  79,16,(Recall) when his Lord called to him in the blessed valley of Tuwa
  79,17,"Go to Fir‘aun (Pharaoh). Indeed, he has crossed all bounds"
  79,18,"And say (to him,) ‘Would you like to purify yourself"
  79,19,"and that I should guide you to your Lord, so that you fear (Him)?‘"
  79,20,"So, he (Musa) showed him the biggest sign"
  79,21,But he rejected and disobeyed
  79,22,"then he turned back, and tried hard (to refute the Messenger)"
  79,23,then he gathered (his people) and shouted
  79,24,"and said, .I am your supreme lord"
  79,25,"So, Allah seized him for an exemplary punishment in the Hereafter and the present world"
  79,26,"Indeed, there is a lesson for him who fears (Allah)"
  79,27,Is your creation more difficult or that of the sky? He has built it
  79,28,"He has raised its height, then made it proper"
  79,29,"and darkened its night, and brought forth its daylight"
  79,30,"and, after that, He spread out the earth"
  79,31,"From it, He brought out its water and its meadows"
  79,32,and firmly fixed the mountains
  79,33,(all this) as a benefit to you and your cattle
  79,34,So when the Greatest Havoc will take place
  79,35,on the day when man will recall what he did
  79,36,and the Hell will be exposed for all who see
  79,37,then for the one who had rebelled
  79,38,and preferred the worldly life (to the Hereafter)
  79,39,the Hell will be the abode
  79,40,"whereas for the one who feared to stand before his Lord, and restrained his self from the (evil) desire"
  79,41,the Paradise will be the abode
  79,42,"They ask you (O Prophet,) about the Hour (the Day of Judgment) as to when it will take place"
  79,43,In which capacity are you to tell this
  79,44,With your Lord is the final word about it
  79,45,You are only a warner for anyone who fears it
  79,46,"The day they will see it, it will seem to them as if they did not live (in the world) but only for one afternoon or for the morning thereof"
