quran[18]{c,v,t}:
  73,20,"Your Lord knows that you stand (in prayer) for nearly two thirds of the night, and (at times) for half of it, and (at times) for one third of it, and (so do) a group of those who are with you. And Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you (O Muslims,) cannot do it in regular way; therefore He turned to you in mercy. Now, recite as much of the Qur‘an as is easy (for you). He knows that some of you may be sick, and others traveling in the land, seeking the grace of Allah, and yet others fighting in Allah‘s way. Therefore, recite as much of it as is easy. And establish Salah, and pay Zakah, and advance to Allah a goodly loan. And whatever good you will send ahead for your own-selves, you will find it with Allah much better in condition, and much greater in reward. And seek forgiveness from Allah. Indeed Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful"
  74,1,"O you, enveloped in a mantle"
  74,2,stand up and warn
  74,3,and pronounce the greatness of your Lord
  74,4,and purify your clothes
  74,5,and keep away from filth
  74,6,and do not do a favour (to anyone merely) to seek more (in return)
  74,7,"And for the sake of your Lord, observe patience"
  74,8,For when the trumpet will be blown
  74,9,that day will be a difficult day
  74,10,not easy for the disbelievers
  74,11,Leave me alone (to deal) with the one whom I created lonely
  74,12,and gave him extensive wealth
  74,13,and sons present before (his) eyes
  74,14,and extended (power and honour) to him pretty well
  74,15,"Still, he aspires that I should give him more"
  74,16,Never! He is inimical towards Our verses
  74,17,I will force him to climb the mountain Sa‘ud
