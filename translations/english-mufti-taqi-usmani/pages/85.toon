quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  4,38,"and (for) those who spend their wealth only to show people, and do not believe in Allah and the Last Day. Anyone for whom Satan is companion, evil he is as a companion"
  4,39,"What harm was there for them if they had believed in Allah and the Last Day, and spent out of what Allah had given them. Allah knows all about them"
  4,40,"Surely, Allah does not wrong (anyone), even to the measure of a particle. If it is a good deed, He multiplies it, and gives a great reward out of His Own pleasure"
  4,41,"Then, how (awful a spectacle) would it be when We shall bring a witness from every community, and shall bring you over them as a witness"
  4,42,"On that Day, those who have disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger shall wish that the earth were leveled with them. They shall not (be able to) conceal anything from Allah"
  4,43,"O you who believe! Do not go near Salah when you are intoxicated, until you know what you say, nor in a state of ‘major impurity‘., __save when you are traversing a way__until you take a bath. If you are sick, or in travel, or if one of you has come after relieving himself, or you have had contact with women, and you find no water, go for some clean dust and wipe your faces and hands (with it). Surely, Allah is Most- Pardoning, Most-Forgiving"
  4,44,Have you not observed those who have been given a share from the Book? They buy misguidance and wish that you (too) lose the way
