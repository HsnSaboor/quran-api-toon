quran[7]{c,v,t}:
  9,80,"(It is all equal whether you) ask pardon for them or do not ask pardon for them. Even if you ask pardon for them seventy times, Allah will never pardon them. That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger. Allah does not lead the sinning people to the right path"
  9,81,"Those who were left behind were happy with their sitting back to the displeasure of the Messenger of Allah, and they disliked carrying out Jihad in the way of Allah with their wealth and lives, and they said, .Do not march in this hot weather. Say, .The fire of Jahannam is much more intense in heat,. only if they could understand"
  9,82,"So, let them laugh a little, and weep a lot, this being a reward of what they used to earn"
  9,83,"Then, if Allah brings you back to a group of them and they seek your permission to march, say to them, .You shall never march with me ever after, and shall never fight an enemy in my company. You were happy with sitting back the first time; now, sit with those remaining behind"
  9,84,"And never offer a prayer on any one of them who dies, and do not stand by his grave. They disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and died while they were sinners"
  9,85,Their wealth and children should not attract you. Allah only wills to punish them with these in this world and that their souls depart while they are disbelievers
  9,86,"When a Surah is revealed (saying), .Believe in Allah and carry out Jihad in the company of His Messenger. the capable ones from them seek your permission and say, .Let us remain with those sitting back"
