quran[10]{c,v,t}:
  10,79,"And Pharaoh said, .Bring to me every knowledgeable magician"
  10,80,"So, when the magicians came, Musa said to them, .Cast what you have to cast"
  10,81,"So, when they had cast, Musa said, .All that you have brought is magic. Allah will certainly bring it to naught. Be assured that Allah does not set right the work of the mischief-makers"
  10,82,"And Allah establishes the truth through His words, even though the guilty ones may dislike it"
  10,83,"Then, except some youths of his people, no one believed in Musa for the fear of Pharaoh and his group, lest he should persecute them. Pharaoh was high-handed in the land and he was of those who crossed all limits"
  10,84,"And Musa said, .My people, if you have believed in Allah, then, in Him place your trust if you are obedient"
  10,85,"So, they said, .In Allah we have placed our trust: Our Lord, do not make us a victim of the unjust people"
  10,86,"and save us, through Your mercy, from the disbelieving people"
  10,87,"And We revealed to Musa and his brother: .Have houses for your people in Egypt, and make your houses worship oriented, and establish Salah, and give good tidings to the believers"
  10,88,"Musa said, .Our Lord, You have given Pharaoh and his group glamour and riches in the worldly life, so that, our Lord, they mislead (people) from Your path. Our Lord, obliterate their riches and harden their hearts, so that they may not come to believe until they witness the painful punishment"
