quran[29]{c,v,t}:
  81,1,When the sun will be folded up
  81,2,and when the stars will swoop down
  81,3,and when the mountains will be set in motion
  81,4,and when the ten-months pregnant she-camels will be abandoned
  81,5,and when the wild beasts will be gathered together
  81,6,and when the seas will be flared up
  81,7,and when the people will be arranged in categories
  81,8,and when the girl-child that was buried alive will be asked
  81,9,for what sin she was killed
  81,10,and when the scrolls (of deeds) will be unrolled
  81,11,and when the sky will be stripped off
  81,12,and when the Hell will be set ablaze
  81,13,and when the Paradise will be brought close
  81,14,then everyone will know what he (or she) has put forward
  81,15,"So, I swear by those (stars) that recede"
  81,16,"that proceed, that withdraw from the scene"
  81,17,and by the night when it departs
  81,18,and the morning when it starts breathing
  81,19,it (the Qur‘an) is surely the word of a noble messenger (Jibra‘il X)
  81,20,the one possessing power and a high status with the Lord of the Throne
  81,21,"the one obeyed there, trusted"
  81,22,Your companion (Muhammad ) is not a madman
  81,23,and he did see him (Jibra‘il X) on the clear horizon
  81,24,And he (the Prophet) is not stingy about (the news of) the unseen
  81,25,Nor is it the word of an outcast satan (devil)
  81,26,Then where are you going
  81,27,It is nothing else but a message of advice for all the worlds
  81,28,for the benefit of any one from among you who intends to go straight
  81,29,"And you cannot intend (to do anything) unless it is so willed by Allah, the Lord of all the worlds"
