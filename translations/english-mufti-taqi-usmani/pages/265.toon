  15,53,"They said, .Do not be scared. We give you good news of a boy who will be knowledgeable"
  15,54,"He said, .Do you give me the good news despite the old age has befallen me? So what good news you are giving to me"
  15,55,"They said, .We have given to you the good news of a fact. So do not be one of those who lose hope"
  15,56,"He said, .Who can lose hope in the mercy of his Lord except those who have lost the straight path"
  15,57,"He said, .Then, what is your mission, O messengers"
  15,58,"They said, .We have been sent to a sinful people"
  15,59,except the family of LuT - all of whom we shall save
  15,60,but his wife. We have ordained that she will be among those who will remain behind

  15,62,"he said, .You are an unfamiliar people"
  15,63,"They said, .No, but we have brought to you that (scourge) in which they have been doubting"

  15,67,And the people of the city came rejoicing
  15,68,"He (LuT) said, .They are my guests; so do not put me to shame"
  15,69,and fear Allah and do not disgrace me
  15,70,"They said, .Had we not forbidden you from (being the guardian of) the whole world"
