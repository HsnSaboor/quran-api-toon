  3,174,"So, they returned with bounty from Allah, and grace, with no evil having even touched them, and submitted to the pleasure of Allah. Allah is the Lord of great bounty"
  3,175,"It is none but Satan who frightens (you) of his friends. So, do not fear them; but fear Me, if you are believers"
  3,176,Those who hasten towards disbelief should not make you grieve. They cannot harm Allah at all. Allah intends not to spare for them any share in the Hereafter. For them there is a mighty punishment
  3,177,"Certainly, those who bought disbelief in exchange for Belief cannot harm Allah at all. For them there is a painful punishment"
  3,178,"Those who disbelieve should not think that the respite We give them is good for them. In fact, We give them respite only that they may increase in sin, and for them there is a humiliating punishment"
  3,179,"Allah is not to leave the believers in the state you are in, unless He separates the impure from the pure. Allah is not to inform you of the Unseen. But Allah selects from His messengers whom He wills. So, believe in Allah and His messengers. If you believe, and fear Allah, you will deserve a great reward"
  3,180,"Those who withhold in miserliness what Allah has given them out of His grace should not take it as good for them. Instead, it is bad for them. They shall be forced, on the Doomsday, to put on what they withheld, as iron-collars round their necks. To Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth. Allah is All-Aware of what you do"
