  55,25,"<h2>The Creation of Humans and Jinns</h2> Allah mentions that He created mankind from clay, like that used in pottery, and created the Jinns from the tip of the flame of a smokeless fire. This was said by Ad-Dahhak from Ibn `Abbas. It was also said by `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"From the best part of the fire, from its smokeless flame.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,  «خُلِقَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ مِنْ نُورٍ، وَخُلِقَ الْجَانُّ مِنْ مَارِجٍ مِنْ نَارٍ، وَخُلِقَ آدَمُ مِمَّا وُصِفَ لَكُم»  (The angels were created from light, the Jinns from a smokeless flame of fire, and `Adam from what was described to you.) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Allah's statement:  فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ  (Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) was explained above. <h2>Allah is the Lord of the Two Easts and the Two Wests</h2> Allah said,  رَبُّ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ وَرَبُّ الْمَغْرِبَيْنِ  ((He is) the Lord of the two easts and the Lord of the two wests.) meaning the sunrise of summer and winter and the sunset of summer and winter. Allah said in another Ayah,  فَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِرَبِّ الْمَشَـرِقِ وَالْمَغَـرِبِ  (So, I swear by the Lord of all the points of sunrise and sunset in the east and the west.)(70:40), referring to the different places from which the sun rises and then sets on people every day. Allah said in another Ayah,  رَّبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَاتَّخِذْهُ وَكِيلاً  (The Lord of the east and the west; none has the right to be worshipped but He. So take Him alone as a trustee.)(73:9), referring to the different places of sunrise and sunset and the benefits that this variation brings to the created, mankind and Jinns,  فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ  (Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) <h2>Allah created Different Types of Water</h2> Allah said,  مَرَجَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ يَلْتَقِيَانِ  (He has Maraja the two seas), or let them loose, according to Ibn `Abbas. Allah's statement,  يَلْتَقِيَانِ  (meeting together.) Ibn Zayd said, \"He prevents them from meeting by the dividing barrier He placed between them to separate them.\" The two seas are the fresh and salty waters, the former coming from running rivers. We discussed this topic in Surat Al-Furqan when explaining Allah's statement;  وَهُوَ الَّذِى مَرَجَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ هَـذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ وَهَـذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخاً وَحِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً  (And it is He Who has let free the two seas: one palatable and sweet, and the other salty and bitter; and He has set a barrier and a complete partition between them.)(25:53) Allah said,  بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخٌ لاَّ يَبْغِيَانِ  (Between them is a barrier which none of them can transgress.) meaning, He has placed a barrier of land between these two types of waters, so that they do not transgress upon each other, which would spoil the characteristics they were created with. Allah said,  يَخْرُجُ مِنْهُمَا الُّلؤْلُؤُ وَالمَرْجَانُ  (Out of them both come out pearls and Al-Marjan. ) pearls are well-known. As for Marjan they say it means small pearls. Mujahid, Qatadah, Abu Ruzayn, Ad-Dahhak said it, and it has also been reported from `Ali. It was also said that it means large, precious pearls, this was mentioned by Ibn Jarir from some of the Salaf. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"When it rains, the oysters in the sea open their mouths. What falls in them, the drops, turns into pearls.\" Its chain of narrators is Sahih. Since this type of adornment is a favor from Allah to the people of earth, He reminded them of it,  فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ  (Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) Allah said,  وَلَهُ الْجَوَارِ الْمُنشَئَاتُ  (And His are Al-Jawar Al-Munsha'at), meaning the ships that float,  فِى الْبَحْرِ  (in the seas), Mujahid said, \"Whatever ship hoists a sail, it is from Munsha'at, if it does not hoist a sail, it is not from the Munsha'at.\" Qatadah said, \"Al-Munsha'at means created.\" Others said that it is Al-Munshi'at meaning, \"launched.\"  كَالاٌّعْلَـمِ  (like A`lam.) This means, they are like mountains with their great size, and it also refers to the trade and commercial services they make possible, transporting cargo from one area to another and from one province to another. Ships provide various benefits for people, including transporting different types of goods they need. Therefore,  فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ  (Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny)  كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ - وَيَبْقَى وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلْـلِ وَالإِكْرَامِ فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ "

  55,30,"<h2>Allah is the Ever Living, Free of all Need</h2> Allah states that all the residents of earth will perish and die. The residents of the heavens will die, except whomever Allah wills. Only Allah's Honorable Face will remain, because our Lord, the Exalted, the Blessed, is the Ever Living Who never dies. Qatadah said, \"First, Allah mentioned His creatures and then He said that all of this will perish.\" And in the reported supplication: `O You the Ever Living Who sustains all that exists! O You Who created the heavens and the earth without precedence. O You, Who Owns the glory and the honor, none has the right to be worshipped except You. We seek refuge with Your mercy. Grant Us success in all of our matters. Please, do not abandon us to rely on ourselves even for an instant nor on any of Your creation.\" Ash-Sha`bi said, \"When you have recited, ﴾كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ ﴿ (Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish.) do not stop, continue reading, ﴾وَيَبْقَى وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلْـلِ وَالإِكْرَامِ ﴿ (And the Face of your Lord Dhul-Jalal wal-Ikram will remain forever.)\"  This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement, ﴾كُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلاَّ وَجْهَهُ﴿ (Everything will perish save His Face.)(28:88) In this Ayah, Allah describes His Noble Face as being Dhul-Jalal wal-Ikram, indicating that He is Worthy of being revered, and thus, never defied; and obeyed, and thus, never disobeyed, ﴾وَاصْبِرْ نَفْسَكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُم بِالْغَدَاةِ وَالْعَشِىِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَهُ﴿ (And keep yourself patiently with those who call on their Lord morning and afternoon, seeking His Face.)(18:28), And as He said about those giving charity: ﴾إِنَّمَا نُطْعِمُكُمْ لِوَجْهِ اللَّهِ﴿ (We feed you seeking Allah's Face only.)(76:9) Ibn `Abbas commented on the meaning of Dhul-Jalal wal-Ikram, by saying, \"Owner of greatness and pride.\" After Allah stated that all of the inhabitants of the earth will die and end up in the Hereafter when He, Dhul-Jalal wal-Ikram, will judge them by His fair judgement, He said, ﴾فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ ﴿ (Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) Allah said, ﴾يَسْأَلُهُ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ هُوَ فِى شَأْنٍ ﴿ (Whosoever is in the heavens and on the earth begs of Him. Every day He is (engaged) in some affair.) In this Ayah, Allah affirms that He is Rich, Free of all wants for anyone else and that all creatures stand in need of Him, in all conditions and situations. They all seek His help willingly or unwillingly. Everyday, He is engaged in some affair. Al-A`mash reported from Mujahid, from `Ubayd bin `Umayr, ﴾كُلَّ يَوْمٍ هُوَ فِى شَأْنٍ﴿ (Every day He is (engaged) in some affair.) He said, \"Of His affairs is that He answers the supplicant, or gives to the one requesting, or removing adversity, or cures the one seeking to be cured.\" "

  55,36,"<h2>A Warning for Humans and Jinn</h2> Ibn Jurayj said that the Ayah, ﴾سَنَفْرُغُ لَكُمْ﴿ (We shall attend to you,) means, `We shall judge you,' while Al-Bukhari said that it means, \"We shall recompense you. Surely, nothing will busy Allah from attending to anything else.\" This type of speech pattern is common in the Arabic language. For example, one would say, \"I will attend to you,\" even when one is not busy with anything else. Allah's saying; ﴾أَيُّهَا الثَّقَلاَنِ﴿ (O you Thaqalan!) refers to the humans and the Jinns, as in the Hadith; ﴾«يَسْمَعُهَا كُلُّ شَيْءٍ إِلَّا الثَّقَلَيْن»﴿ (Everyone will be able to hear it, except the Thaqalayn.) In another narration that explains it, the Prophet said, ﴾«إِلَّا الْإِنْسَ وَالْجِن»﴿ (...except mankind and the Jinns.) Allah said, ﴾فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ ﴿ (Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny), then, ﴾يمَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنسِ إِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَن تَنفُذُواْ مِنْ أَقْطَـرِ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ فَانفُذُواْ لاَ تَنفُذُونَ إِلاَّ بِسُلْطَـنٍ ﴿ (O assembly of Jinn and men! If you are able to pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth, then pass beyond (them)! But you will never be able to pass them, except with authority (from Allah)!) meaning, `you will never be able to escape Allah's orders and decrees, because it encompasses you. You will never be able to avoid or avert His rule and judgement over you, you are surrounded by it wherever you may be.' This is also about the Gathering when the angels, comprising seven lines in every direction, will surround the creatures. None of the creatures will be able to escape on that Day, ﴾إِلاَّ بِسُلْطَـنٍ﴿ (except with authority) meaning, except with the commandment from Allah, ﴾يَقُولُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ - كَلاَّ لاَ وَزَرَ - إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ ﴿ (On that Day man will say: \"Where (is the refuge) to flee\" No! There is no refuge! Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.)(75:10-12), ﴾وَالَّذِينَ كَسَبُواْ السَّيِّئَاتِ جَزَآءُ سَيِّئَةٍ بِمِثْلِهَا وَتَرْهَقُهُمْ ذِلَّةٌ مَّا لَهُمْ مِّنَ اللَّهِ مِنْ عَاصِمٍ كَأَنَّمَا أُغْشِيَتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ قِطَعًا مِّنَ الَّيْلِ مُظْلِماً أُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ ﴿ (And those who earned evil deeds, the recompense of an evil deed is the like thereof, and humiliating disgrace will cover them. No defender will they have from Allah. Their faces will be covered as it were with pieces from the darkness of night. They are the dwellers of Fire, they will abide therein forever.)(10:27) Allah's statement, ﴾يُرْسَلُ عَلَيْكُمَا شُوَاظٌ مِّن نَّارٍ وَنُحَاسٌ فَلاَ تَنتَصِرَانِ ﴿ (There will be sent against you both, Shuwaz of fire and Nuhas, and you will not be able to defend yourselves.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that Shuwaz is the flame of fire. Abu Salih said, \"It is the flame above the fire below the smoke.\" Ad-Dahhak said, ﴾شُوَاظٌ مِّن نَّارٍ﴿ (Shuwaz of fire) \"A flood of fire.\" Allah said; ﴾وَنُحَاسٌ﴿ (and Nuhas) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas; \"The smoke of the fire.\" Similar was reported from Abu Salih, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Abu Sinan. Ibn Jarir said that the Arabs used to call the smoke of the fire, Nuhas and Nihas. But he said that the scholars of Qur'anic recitation said that in this Ayah, the word recited is Nuhas. Mujahid said, \"Molten brass poured over their heads.\" Qatadah held the same view. Ad-Dahhak said,\"Nuhas is liquid copper.\" The Ayah means, `if you, mankind and the Jinns, try to escape on the Day of Resurrection, then the angels, including those among them who guard Hellfire, will bring you back by directing smoke of fire and molten brass on you.' Allah's statement, ﴾فَلاَ تَنتَصِرَانِفَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ ﴿ (and you will not be able to defend yourselves. Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) ﴾فَإِذَا انشَقَّتِ السَّمَآءُ فَكَانَتْ وَرْدَةً كَالدِّهَانِ فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ ﴿"
