  91,10,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2> Recitation of Surah Ash-Shams wa Duhaha in the `Isha' Prayer The Hadith of Jabir which was recorded in the Two Sahihs has already been mentioned. In it the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Mu`adh,  «هَلَّا صَلَّيْتَ بِــ  سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى  وَالشَّمْسِ وَضُحَـهَا  وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى »  (Why didn't you pray with (the recitation of) (Glorify the Name of your Lord the Most High) (87), (By the sun and Duhaha) (91), and (By the night as it envelops) (92))  بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ  In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <h2>Allah swears by His Creation that the Person Who purifies Himself will be Successful and the Person Who corrupts Himself will fail</h2> Mujahid said,  وَالشَّمْسِ وَضُحَـهَا  (By the sun and Duhaha.) \"This means, by its light.\" Qatadah said,  وَضُحَـهَا  (wa Duhaha.) \"The whole day.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"The correct view is what has been said, `Allah swears by the sun and its daytime, because the clear light of the sun is daytime.\"'  وَالْقَمَرِ إِذَا تَلـهَا  (By the moon as it Talaha.) Mujahid said, \"It follows it (the sun).\" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,  وَالْقَمَرِ إِذَا تَلـهَا  (By the moon as it Talaha.) \"It follows the day.\" Qatadah said, \"`as it Talaha (follows it)' is referring to the night of the Hilal (the new crescent moon). When the sun goes down, the Hilal is visible.\" Concerning Allah's statement,  وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا جَلَّـهَا  (By the day as it Jallaha.) Mujahid said, \"When it illuminates.\" Thus, Mujahid said,  وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا جَلَّـهَا  (By the day as it Jallaha.) \"This is similar to Allah's statement,  وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا تَجَلَّى  (By the day as it Tajalla.) (92:2)\" And they have said concerning Allah's statement,  وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَـهَا  (By the night as it Yaghshaha.) meaning, when it covers the sun, which takes place when sun disappears and the horizons become dark. Concerning Allah's statement,  وَالسَّمَآءِ وَمَا بَنَـهَا  (By the heaven and Ma Banaha.) The meaning here could be for descriptive purposes, meaning \"By the heaven and its construction.\" This was said by Qatadah. It could also mean \"By the heaven and its Constructor.\" This was stated by Mujahid. Both views are interrelated, and construction means raising. This is as Allah says,  وَالسَّمَآءَ بَنَيْنَـهَا بِأَيْدٍ  (With Hands did We construct the heaven.) (51:47) meaning, with strength.  وَالسَّمَآءَ بَنَيْنَـهَا بِأَيْدٍ وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ - وَالاٌّرْضَ فَرَشْنَـهَا فَنِعْمَ الْمَـهِدُونَ  (Verily, We are able to extend the vastness of space thereof. And We have spread out the earth: how excellent a spreader are We!) (51:47-48) This is also similar to Allah's statement,  وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا طَحَـهَا  (By the earth and Ma Tahaha.) Mujahid said, \"Tahaha means He spread it out.\" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,  وَمَا طَحَـهَا  (and Ma Tahaha.) \"This means what He created in it.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"Tahaha means that He proportioned it.\" Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Ath-Thawri, Abu Salih and Ibn Zayd all said that  طَحَـهَا  (Tahaha) means, He spread it out. Allah then says,  وَنَفْسٍ وَمَا سَوَّاهَا  (By Nafs, and Ma Sawwaha (Who apportioned it).) meaning, He created it sound and well-proportioned upon the correct nature (Al-Fitrah). This is as Allah says,  فَأَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفاً فِطْرَةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى فَطَرَ النَّاسَ عَلَيْهَا لاَ تَبْدِيلَ لِخَلْقِ اللَّهِ  (So set you your face towards the religion, Hanif. Allah's Fitrah with which He has created mankind. No change let there be in the Khalqillah.) (30:30) The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «كُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلى الْفِطْرَةِ فَأَبَوَاهُ يُهَوِّدَانِهِ أَوْ يُنَصِّرَانِهِ أَوْ يُمَجِّسَانِهِ، كَمَا تُولَدُ الْبَهِيمَةُ بَهِيمَةً جَمْعَاءَ، هَلْ تُحِسُّونَ فِيهَا مِنْ جَدْعَاءَ؟»  (Every child that is born, is born upon the Fitrah, but his parents make him a Jew, a Christian, or a Zoroastrian. This is just as the animal is born, complete with all of its parts. Do you notice any mutilation in it) Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this Hadith from Abu Hurayrah. In Sahih Muslim, it has been narrated from `Iyad bin Himar Al-Mujashi`i that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «يَقُولُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: إِنِّي خَلَقْتُ عِبَادِي حُنَفَاءَ فَجَاءَتْهُمُ الشَّيَاطِينُ فَاجْتَالَتْهُمْ عَنْ دِينِهِم»  (Allah the Mighty and Majestic says, \"Verily I created My servants Hunafa' (as monotheists), but then the devils came to them and distracted them from their religion.)\" Then Allah says,  فَأَلْهَمَهَا فُجُورَهَا وَتَقْوَاهَا  (Then He showed it its Fujur and its Taqwa.) meaning, He showed him to his transgression and his Taqwa. This means that He clarified that for it and He guided it to what has been ordained for him. Ibn `Abbas said,  فَأَلْهَمَهَا فُجُورَهَا وَتَقْوَاهَا  (Then He showed it its Fujur and its Taqwa.) \"He explained the good and the evil to it (the soul).\" Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Ath-Thawri all said the same. Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"He gave him inspiration (to see what was) good and evil.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"He made its Fujur and its Taqwa inside of it.\" Ibn Jarir recorded from Abul-Aswad Ad-Dili that he said, \"`Imran bin Husayn said to me, `Do you think that what the people do, and what they strive for is a thing that is pre-ordained and predestined for them, or is it a thing which is only written after the Message comes to them from the Prophet , when there will be an evidence against them' I said, `Rather it is something preordained upon them.' Then he said, `Is that an injustice' Then I became extremely frightened of him (due to what he was saying), and I said to him, `There is nothing except that He (Allah) created it and possesses it in His Hand. He is not asked about what He does, while they (His creation) will be asked.' He (`Imran) then said, `May Allah guide you! I only asked you about that in order to inform you that a man from Muzaynah or Juhaynah tribe came to the Allah's Messenger ﷺ and asked him: \"O Messenger of Allah! Do you consider the actions of mankind and their struggles to be preordained for them and written for them from Qadr, or something written for them only after the Message came to them from their Prophet, when there will be an evidence against them\" He (the Prophet ) replied:  «بَلْ شَيْءٌ قَدْ قُضِيَ عَلَيْهِم»  (Rather it is something preordained for them.) So the man said, \"Then what is the point of our actions\" The Prophet replied,  «مَنْ كَانَ اللهُ خَلَقَهُ لإِحْدَى الْمَنْزِلَتَيْنِ يُهَيِّئُهُ لَهَا، وَتَصْدِيقُ ذَلِكَ فِي كِتَابِ اللهِ تَعَالَى:  وَنَفْسٍ وَمَا سَوَّاهَا - فَأَلْهَمَهَا فُجُورَهَا وَتَقْوَاهَا »  (Whoever Allah created for one of the two positions (Paradise or Hell), He makes it easy for him (to attain). The proof of that is in the Book of Allah (By Nafs, and Ma Sawwaha (Who apportioned it). Then He showed it its Fujur and its Taqwa).)\" Ahmad and Muslim both recorded this Hadith. Allah then says,  قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن زَكَّـهَا - وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّـهَا  (Indeed he succeeds who purifies it. And indeed he fails who Dassaha.) This could mean that whoever purifies himself by obedience to Allah, then he will be successful. This is as Qatadah said, \"He cleanses it from the lowly and despicable characteristics.\" Similar to this has been reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Sa`id bin Jubayr.  وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّـهَا  (And indeed he fails who Dassaha.) meaning, to conceal it. This means that he makes it dull, and he disregards it by neglecting to allow it to receive guidance. He treats it in this manner until he performs acts of disobedience and he abandons obedience of Allah. It also could mean that he is indeed successful whose soul Allah purifies, and he has failed whose soul Allah corrupts. This is like what was reported by Al-`Awfi and `Ali bin Abi Talhah from Ibn `Abbas. At-Tabarani recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to stop whenever he recited this Ayah,  وَنَفْسٍ وَمَا سَوَّاهَا - فَأَلْهَمَهَا فُجُورَهَا وَتَقْوَاهَا  (By Nafs, and Ma Sawwaha (Who apportioned it). Then He showed it its Fujur and its Taqwa.) Then he would say,  «اللْهُمَّ آتِ نَفْسِي تَقْوَاهَا، أَنْتَ وَلِيُّهَا وَمَوْلَاهَا، وَخَيْرُ مَنْ زَكَّاهَا»  (O Allah! Give my soul its good. You are its Guardian and Master, and the best to purify it.)\" Another Hadith Imam Ahmad recorded that Zayd bin Arqam said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «اللْهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ الْعَجْز وَالْكَسَلِ، وَالْهَرَمِ وَالْجُبْنِ وَالْبُخْلِ وَعَذَابِ الْقَبْرِ. اللْهُمَّ آتِ نَفْسِي تَقْوَاهَا، وَزَكِّهَا أَنْتَ خَيْرُ مَنْ زَكَّاهَا، أَنْتَ وَلِيُّهَا وَمَوْلَاهَا. اللْهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ قَلْبٍ لَا يَخْشَعُ، وَمِنْ نَفْسٍ لَا تَشْبَعُ، وَعِلْمٍ لَا يَنْفَعُ، وَدَعْوَةٍ لَا يُسْتَجَابُ لَهَا»  (O Allah! Verily, I seek refuge with You from weakness, laziness, senility (of old age), cowardliness, stinginess and the torment of the grave. O Allah! Give my soul its good and purify it, for You are the best to purify it. You are its Guardian and Master. O Allah! Verily, I seek refuge with You from a heart that is not humble, a soul that is not satisfied, knowledge that does not benefit and a supplication that is not answered.) Zayd then said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to teach us these (words) and we now teach them to you.\" Muslim also recorded this Hadith. "

  91,15,"<h2>The Rejection of Thamud and Allah's Destruction of Them</h2> Allah informs that Thamud rejected their Messenger because of the injustice and transgression they practiced. This was said by Mujahid, Qatadah and others. Therefore, this resulted in a rejection in their hearts for the guidance and conviction their Messenger came to them with.  إِذِ انبَعَثَ أَشْقَـهَا  (When their most wicked went forth.) meaning, the most wicked person of the tribe, and he was Qudar bin Salif, the one who killed the she-camel. He was leader of the tribe of Thamud, and he is the one whom Allah refers to in His saying,  فَنَادَوْاْ صَـحِبَهُمْ فَتَعَاطَى فَعَقَرَ  (But they called their comrade and he took (a sword) and killed (her).) (54:29) This man was mighty and respected among his people. He was of noble lineage and a leader who was obeyed. This is just as Imam Ahmad recorded from `Abdullah bin Zam`ah. He said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave a sermon in which he mentioned the she-camel and he mentioned the man who killed her. Then he said,  «إِذِ انبَعَثَ أَشْقَـهَا  انْبَعَثَ لَهَا رَجُلٌ عَارِمٌ عَزِيزٌ مَنِيعٌ فَي رَهْطِهِ مِثْلُ أَبِي زَمْعَة»  ((When their most wicked went forth.)( A strong and mighty man who was invincible among his tribe, like Abu Zam`ah, went forth to her.) This Hadith was recorded by Al-Bukhari in his Book of Tafsir, and Muslim in his Book of the Description of the Hellfire. At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i both recorded it in their Sunans in their Books of Tafsir. <h2>The Story of Salih's She-Camel</h2> Allah then says,  فَقَالَ لَهُمْ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ  (But the Messenger of Allah said to them) referring to Salih.  نَاقَةُ اللَّهِ  (That is the she-camel of Allah!) meaning, `beware of touching the she-camel of Allah with any harm.'  وَسُقْيَـهَا  (and its drink!) meaning, `do not transgress against her in her drinking, for she has been allocated a day to drink and you have been allocated a day to drink, as is known to you.' Then Allah says,  فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَعَقَرُوهَا  (Then they denied him and they killed it.) which means they rejected what he came with. This resulted in them killing the she-camel that Allah had brought out of the rock as a sign for them and a proof against them.  فَدَمْدمَ عَلَيْهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ بِذَنبِهِمْ  (So their Lord destroyed them because of their sin,) meaning, He became angry with them and He annihilated them.  فَسَوَّاهَا  (Fasawwaha!) meaning, He made the punishment descend upon them all equally. Qatadah said, \"It has reached us that the leader of tribe of Thamud did not kill the she-camel until their youth, their elderly, their males and their females all pledged allegiance to him. So when the people cooperated in killing her, Allah destroyed them all with the same punishment due to their sin.\" Allah said,  وَلاَ يَخَافُ  (And He feared not) it has also been recited as (فَلَا يَخَافُ) (So He feared not)  عُقْبَـهَا  (the consequences thereof.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Allah does not fear any consequences from anyone else.\" Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Bakr bin `Abdullah Al-Muzani and others all said the same. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Ash-Shams, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah. "

  92,11,"<h2>The Recitation of Surat Al-Layl in the `Isha' Prayer</h2> The statement of the Prophet to Mu`adh has already preceded, where he said,  «فَهَلَّا صَلَّيْتَ ب  سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى  وَالشَّمْسِ وَضُحَـهَا  وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى»  (Why did you not pray with (the recitation of) (Glorify the Name of your Lord the Most High) (87), and (By the sun and Duhaha) (91), and (By the night as it envelops) (92))  بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ  In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <h2>Swearing by the Diversity of Mankind in Their Efforts and informing of the Different Results of that</h2> Allah swears by saying:  الْلَّيْلَإِذَا يَغْشَى  (By the night as it envelops.) meaning, when it covers the creation with its darkness.  وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا تَجَلَّى  (By the day as it appears.) meaning, with its light and its radiance.  وَمَا خَلَقَ الذَّكَرَ وَالاٍّنثَى  (By Him Who created male and female.) This is similar to Allah's saying,  وَخَلَقْنَـكُمْ أَزْوَجاً  (And We have created you in pairs.) (78:8) It is also similar to saying,  وَمِن كُلِّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَا زَوْجَيْنِ  (And of everything We have created pairs.) (51:49) And just as these things that are being sworn by are opposites, likewise that which this swearing is about are opposing things. This is why Allah says,  إِنَّ سَعْيَكُمْ لَشَتَّى  (Certainly, your efforts and deeds are diverse. ) meaning, the actions of the servants that they have performed are also opposites and diverse. Therefore, there are those who do good and there are those who do evil. Allah then says,  فَأَمَّا مَنْ أَعْطَى وَاتَّقَى  (As for him who gives and has Taqwa.) meaning, he gives what he has been commanded to give and he fears Allah in his affairs.  وَصَدَّقَ بِالْحُسْنَى  (And believes in Al-Husna.) meaning, in the compensation for that. This was said by Qatadah. Khusayf said, \"In the reward.\" Then Allah says,  فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَى  (We will make smooth for him the path of ease.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Meaning for goodness.\" Thus, Allah says,  وَأَمَّا مَن بَخِلَ  (But he who is greedy) meaning, with that which he has.  وَاسْتَغْنَى  (and thinks himself self-sufficient,) `Ikrimah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means he is stingy with his wealth and considers himself to be in no need of his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.\" This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim.  وَكَذَّبَ بِالْحُسْنَى  (And denies Al-Husna.) meaning, the recompense in the abode of the Hereafter.  فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْعُسْرَى  (We will make smooth for him the path to evil.) meaning, the path of evil. This is as Allah says,  وَنُقَلِّبُ أَفْئِدَتَهُمْ وَأَبْصَـرَهُمْ كَمَا لَمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَنَذَرُهُمْ فِى طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ  (And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away, as they refused to believe therein for the first time, and We shall leave them in their trespass to wander blindly.) (6:110) And there are many Ayat with this meaning, proving that Allah rewards those who intend good with success, while whoever intends evil is abandoned, and all of this is in accordance with a preordained decree. There are also many Hadiths that prove this. <h2>The Narration of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq</h2> Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Bakr that he said to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, \"O Messenger of Allah! Do we act according to what has already been decided, or is the matter just beginning (i.e., still undecided)\" He replied,  «بَلْ عَلَى أَمْرٍ قَدْ فُرِغَ مِنْه»  (Indeed it is according to what has already been decided.) Then Abu Bakr said, \"Then what (good) are deeds, O Messenger of Allah\" He replied,  «كُلٌّ مُيَسَّرٌ لِمَا خُلِقَ لَه»  (Everyone will find it easy to do such deeds that will lead him to what he was created for.) <h2>The Narration of `Ali</h2> Al-Bukhari recorded from `Ali bin Abi Talib that they (the Companions) were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ at the cemetery of Baqi` Al-Gharqad for a funeral, when the Prophet said,  «مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا وَقَدْ كُتِبَ مَقْعَدُهُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَمَقْعَدُهُ مِنَ النَّار»  (There is none among you except that his place has already been written, a seat in Paradise and a seat in the Hellfire.) They said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Should we depend on this\" He replied,  «اعْمَلُوا ، فَكُلٌّ مُيَسَّرٌ لِمَا خُلِقَ لَه»  (Perform deeds for everyone will have the deeds of what he was created for (Paradise or Hell) made easy for him.) Then he recited the Ayah  فَأَمَّا مَنْ أَعْطَى وَاتَّقَى - وَصَدَّقَ بِالْحُسْنَى - فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَى  (As for him who gives and has Taqwa, and believes in Al-Husna. We will make smooth for him the path of ease.)\" until the Ayah:  لِلْعُسْرَى  (the path to evil) He (Imam Al-Bukhari) also recorded another similar narration from `Ali bin Abi Talib in which he said, \"We were at a funeral in the cemetery of Baqi` Al-Gharqad when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came and sat down. So we came and sat around him and he had a stick with him. Then he bowed his head and he began to scratch the ground with his stick. He then said,  «مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ أَوْ مَا مِنْ نَفْسٍ مَنْفُوسَةٍ إِلَّا كُتِبَ مَكَانُهَا مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَالنَّارِ،وَإِلَّا قَدْ كُتِبَتْ شَقِيَّةً أَوْ سَعِيدَة»  (There is not anyone among you -- or is not a single soul (that has been created) -- except that his place has been written in Paradise or in the Fire, and it has been written that he will be miserable or happy.) A man said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Should we just depend on what has been written for us and give up performing deeds For whoever of us is of the people of happiness then he will be of the people of happiness, and whoever among us is of the people of misery then he will be of the people of misery.\" The Prophet replied,  «أَمَّا أَهْلُ السَّعَادَةِ فَيُيَسَّرُونَ لِعَمَلِ أَهْلِ السَّعَادَةِ، وَأَمَّا أَهْلُ الشَّقَاءِ فَيُيَسَّرُونَ إِلَى عَمَلِ أَهْلِ الشَّقَاءِ، ثُمَّ قَرَأَ:  (Those people who are the people of happiness, they will have the deeds of the people of happiness made easy for them. And those people who are the people of misery, they will have the deeds of the people of misery made easy for them.) Then he recited the Ayah:  فَأَمَّا مَنْ أَعْطَى وَاتَّقَى - وَصَدَّقَ بِالْحُسْنَى - فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَى - وَأَمَّا مَن بَخِلَ وَاسْتَغْنَى  وَكَذَّبَ بِالْحُسْنَى- فَسَنُيَسّرُهُ لِلْعُسْرَى-»  (As for him who gives and has Taqwa, and believes in Al-Husna. We will make smooth for him the path of ease (goodness). But he who is greedy and thinks himself self-sufficient, and belies Al-Husna. We will make smooth for him the path to evil.)) The other compilers of the Group have also recorded this Hadith. <h2>The Narration of `Abdullah bin `Umar</h2> Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Umar that `Umar said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Do you think that the deeds that we do are a matter that is already predetermined or are they something just beginning or new\" The Prophet replied,  «فِيمَا قَدْ فُرِغَ مِنْهُ، فَاعْمَلْ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ، فَإِنَّ كُلًّا مُيَسَّرٌ، أَمَّا مَنْ كَانَ مِنْ أَهْلِ السَّعَادَةِ فَإِنَّهُ يَعْمَلُ لِلسَّعَادَةِ، وَأَمَّا مَنْ كَانَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الشَّقَاءِ فَإِنَّهُ يَعْمَلُ لِلشَّقَاء»  (It is something that has already been predetermined. Therefore, work deeds, O son of Al-Khattab! For verily, each person will have things made easy for him. So whoever is from the people of happiness, then he will work deeds for happiness, and whoever is from the people of misery, then he will work deeds for misery.)\" This Hadith has been recorded by At-Tirmidhi in the Book of Al-Qadar and he said \"Hasan Sahih.\" Another Hadith Narrated by Jabir Ibn Jarir recorded from Jabir bin `Abdullah that he said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Are we performing deeds for something that has already been predetermined or is the matter based upon what we are just doing (now)\" The Prophet replied,  «لِأَمْرٍ قَدْ فُرِغَ مِنْه»  (It is a matter that has been predetermined.) Then Suraqah said, \"Then what is the purpose of deeds\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ then said,  «كُلُّ عَامِلٍ مُيَسَّرٌ لِعَمَلِه»  (Everyone who does deeds will have his deeds made easy for him.) Muslim also recorded this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded from `Amir bin `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr that he said, \"Abu Bakr used to free servants upon their acceptance of Islam in Makkah. He used to free the elderly and the women when they accepted Islam. So his father said to him, `O my son! I see that you are freeing people who are weak. But if you freed strong men they could stand with you, defend you and protect you.' Abu Bakr replied, `O my father! I only want -- and I think he said -- what is with Allah.' Some people of my family have told me this Ayah was revealed about him:  فَأَمَّا مَنْ أَعْطَى وَاتَّقَى - وَصَدَّقَ بِالْحُسْنَى - فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَى  (As for him who gives and has Taqwa, and believes in Al-Husna. We will make smooth for him the path of ease.)\" Then Allah says,  وَمَا يُغْنِى عَنْهُ مَالُهُ إِذَا تَرَدَّى  (And what will his wealth avail him when he goes down) Mujahid said, \"This means when he dies.\" Abu Salih and Malik said -- narrating from Zayd bin Aslam, \"When he goes down into the Fire.\" "
