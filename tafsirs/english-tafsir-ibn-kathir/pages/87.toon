tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  4,52,"<h2>Chastising and Cursing the Jews for Claiming Purity for Themselves and Believing in Jibt and Taghut</h2> Al-Hasan and Qatadah said, \"This Ayah, ﴾أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ يُزَكُّونَ أَنفُسَهُمْ﴿ (Have you not seen those who claim sanctity for themselves) was revealed about the Jews and Christians when they said, `We are Allah's children and His loved ones.\"' Ibn Zayd also said, \"This Ayah was revealed concerning their statement, ﴾نَحْنُ أَبْنَاءُ اللَّهِ وَأَحِبَّاؤُهُ﴿ (We are the children of Allah and His loved ones) and their statement, ﴾لَن يَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ إِلاَّ مَن كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَـرَى﴿ (None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian).\" This is why Allah said, ﴾بَلِ اللَّهُ يُزَكِّى مَن يَشَآءُ﴿ (Nay, but Allah sanctifies whom He wills,) meaning, the decision in this matter is with Allah Alone, because He has perfect knowledge of the true reality and secrets of all things. Allah then said, ﴾وَلاَ يُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلاً﴿ (And they will not be dealt with injustice even equal to the extent of a Fatil, ) meaning, He does no injustice with anyone's compensation in any part of his reward, even if it was the weight of a Fatil. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, `Ata', Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others among the Salaf said that Fatil means, \"The scalish thread in the long slit of the date-stone.\" Allah said, ﴾انظُرْ كَيفَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الكَذِبَ﴿ (Look, how they invent a lie against Allah,) claiming purity for themselves, their claim that they are Allah's children and His loved ones, their statement; ﴾لَن يَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ إِلاَّ مَن كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَـرَى﴿ (None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian) their statement; ﴾لَن تَمَسَّنَا النَّارُ إِلاَ أَيَّامًا مَّعْدُودَتٍ﴿ (The Fire shall not touch us but for a number of days) and their reliance on the righteous deeds of their forefathers. Allah has decreed that the good actions of the fathers do not help the children, when He said, ﴾تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُم مَّا كَسَبْتُم﴿ (That was a nation who has passed away. They shall receive the reward of what they earned and you of what you earn). Allah then said, ﴾وَكَفَى بِهِ إِثْماً مُّبِيناً﴿ (and enough is that as a manifest sin. ) meaning, these lies and fabrications of theirs are sufficent. Allah's statement, ﴾أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ نَصِيباً مِّنَ الْكِتَـبِ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْجِبْتِ وَالطَّـغُوتِ﴿ (Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture They believe in Jibt and Taghut). Muhammad bin Ishaq said from Hassan bin Fa'id that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, \"Jibt is sorcery and Taghut is the Shaytan.\" Abu Nasr Isma`il bin Hammad Al-Jawhari, the renowned scholar, said in his book As-Sihah, \"Al-Jibt means idol, soothsayer and sorcerer.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah was asked about Taghut, and he said, \"They are soothsayers upon whom the devils descend.\" Mujahid said \"Taghut is a devil in the shape of man, and they refer to him for judgment.\" Imam Malik said, \"Taghut is every object that is worshipped instead of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.\" <h2>Disbelievers Are not Better Guided Than Believers</h2> Allah said, ﴾وَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ هَـؤُلاءِ أَهْدَى مِنَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ سَبِيلاً﴿ (and say to those who disbelieve, \"These people are better guided on the way,\" than the believers.) preferring the disbelievers over Muslims, because of their ignorance, un-religious nature and disbelief in Allah's Book which is before them. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Ikrimah said, \"Huyay bin Akhtab and Ka`b bin Al-Ashraf (two Jewish leaders) came to the people of Makkah, who said to them, `You (Jews) are people of the Book and knowledge, so judge us and Muhammad.' They said, `Describe yourselves and describe Muhammad.' They said, `We keep relation with kith and kin, slaughter camels (for the poor), release the indebted and provide water for the pilgrims. As for Muhammad he is without male children, he severed our relations, and the thieves who rob pilgrims (the tribe of) Ghifar follow him. So who is better, we or him' They said, `You are more righteous and better guided.' Thereafter, Allah sent down, ﴾أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ نَصِيبًا﴿ (Have you not seen those who were given a portion).\" This story was also reported from Ibn `Abbas and several others among the Salaf. Allah's Curse on the Jews This Ayah 4:52 contains a curse for the Jews and informs them that they have no supporter in this life or the Hereafter, because they sought the help of the idolators. They uttered this statement in Ayah 4:51 to lure the disbelievers into supporting them, and they ultimately gathered their forces for the battle of Al-Ahzab, forcing the Prophet and his Companions to dig a defensive tunnel around Al-Madinah. But, Allah saved the Muslims from their evil, ﴾وَرَدَّ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِغَيْظِهِمْ لَمْ يَنَالُواْ خَيْراً وَكَفَى اللَّهُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ الْقِتَالَ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ قَوِيّاً عَزِيزاً ﴿ (And Allah drove back those who disbelieved in their rage, they gained no advantage (booty). Allah sufficed for the believers in the fighting. And Allah is Ever All-Strong, All-Mighty). "

  4,55,"<h2>The Envy and Miserly Conduct of the Jews</h2> Allah asked the Jews if they have a share in the dominion. That is merely a statement of rebuke, since they do not have any share in the dominion. Allah then described them as misers, ﴾فَإِذاً لاَّ يُؤْتُونَ النَّاسَ نَقِيراً﴿ (Then in that case they would not give mankind even a Naqir.) Meaning, if they had a share in the sovereignty and dominion, they would not give anyone anything, especially Muhammad , even if it was the speck on the back of a date-stone, which is the meaning of Naqir according to Ibn `Abbas and the majority of the scholars. This Ayah is similar to another of Allah's statements, ﴾قُل لَّوْ أَنتُمْ تَمْلِكُونَ خَزَآئِنَ رَحْمَةِ رَبِّى إِذًا لأمْسَكْتُمْ خَشْيَةَ الإِنفَاقِ﴿ (Say: \"If you possessed the treasure of the mercy of my Lord, then you would surely withold it out of fear of spending it.) meaning, for fear that what you have might end, although there is no such possibility here. This only demonstrates their greedy and stingy nature. This is why Allah said, ﴾وَكَانَ الإنْسَـنُ قَتُورًا﴿ (And man is ever Qatur) meaning Bakhil (stingy). Allah then said, ﴾أَمْ يَحْسُدُونَ النَّاسَ عَلَى مَآ ءَاتَـهُمُ اللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ﴿ (Or do they envy men for what Allah has given them of His Bounty) referring to their envy of the Prophet for the great prophethood that Allah entrusted him with. Their envy made them reject him, because he was an Arab and not from the Children of Israel. At-Tabarani recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that, ﴾أَمْ يَحْسُدُونَ النَّاسَ﴿ (Or do they envy men) means, \"We are the worthy people, rather than the rest of the people.\" Allah said, ﴾فَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَآ ءَالَ إِبْرَهِيمَ الْكِتَـبَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ مُّلْكاً عَظِيماً﴿ (Then, We have already given the family of Ibrahim the Book and Al-Hikmah, and conferred upon them a great kingdom.) meaning, We gave the prophethood to the tribes of the Children of Israel, who are among the offspring of Ibrahim and sent down the Books to them. These Prophets ruled the Jews with the prophetic tradition, and We made kings among them. Yet, ﴾فَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ ءَامَنَ بِهِ﴿ (Of them were (some) who believed in it;) referring to Allah's favor and bounty (Prophets, Books, kingship), ﴾وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن صَدَّ عَنْهُ﴿ (and of them were (some) who rejected it) by disbelieving in it, ignoring it, and hindering the people from its path, although this bounty was from and for them, the Children of Israel. They disputed with their own Prophets; so what about you, O Muhammad , especially since you are not from the Children of Israel Mujahid said, ﴾فَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ ءَامَنَ بِهِ﴿ (Of them were (some) who believed in him,) \"Muhammad , ﴾وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن صَدَّ عَنْهُ﴿ (and of them were (some) who rejected him.)\" Therefore, O Muhammad, the rejection of you because of their disbelief is even more severe and they are even further from the truth that you brought them. This is why Allah threatened them, ﴾وَكَفَى بِجَهَنَّمَ سَعِيراً﴿ (and enough is Hell for burning (them).), meaning, the Fire is a just punishment for them because of their disbelief, rebellion and defiance of Allah's Books and Messengers. "

  4,57,"<h2>The Punishment of Those Who Disbelieve in Allah's Books and Messengers</h2> Allah describes the torment in the Fire of Jahannam for those who disbelieve in His Ayat and hinder from the path of His Messengers. Allah said, ﴾إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا﴿ (Surely, those who disbelieved in Our Ayat ,) meaning, We will place them in the Fire which will encompass every part of their bodies. Allah then states that their punishment and torment are everlasting, ﴾كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُمْ بَدَّلْنَـهُمْ جُلُوداً غَيْرَهَا لِيَذُوقُواْ الْعَذَابَ﴿ (We shall burn them in Fire. As often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for other skins that they may taste the punishment). Al-A`mash said that Ibn `Umar said, \"When their skin are burned, they will be given another skin in replacement, and this skin will be as white as paper.\" This was collected by Ibn Abi Hatim, who also recorded that Al-Hasan said, ﴾كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُمْ﴿ (As often as their skins are roasted through,) \"Their skin will be roasted through, seventy thousand times every day.\" Husayn said; Fudayl added that Hisham said that Al-Hasan also said that, ﴾كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُمْ﴿ (As often as their skins are roasted through, ) means, \"Whenever the Fire has roasted them through and consumed their flesh, they will be told, `Go back as you were before,' and they will.\" <h2>The Wealth of the Righteous; Paradise and its Joy</h2> Allah said, ﴾وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ سَنُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً﴿ (But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall admit them to Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), abiding therein forever.) describing the destination of the happy ones in the gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers flow in all of its areas, spaces and corners, wherever they desire and wish. They will reside in it for eternity, and they will not be transferred or removed from it, nor would they want to move from it. Allah said, ﴾لَّهُمْ فِيهَآ أَزْوَجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ﴿ (Therein they shall have Azwajun Mutahharatun (purified mates),) free of menstruation, postnatal bleeding, filth, bad manners and shortcomings. Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah means, \"They are purified of filth and foul things.\" Similar was said by `Ata', Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, An-Nakha`i, Abu Salih, `Atiyah, and As-Suddi. Mujahid said that they are, free of urine, menstruation, spit, mucous and pregnancies.\" Allah's statement, ﴾وَنُدْخِلُهُمْ ظِـلاًّ ظَلِيلاً﴿ (And We shall admit them to shades, wide and ever deepening (Paradise).) means, wide, extensive, pure and elegant shade. Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said, ﴾«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لَشَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا: شَجَرَةَ الْخُلْد»﴿ (There is a tree in Paradise, that if a rider travels under its shade for a hundred years, he will not cross it. It is the Tree of Everlasting Life.) "
  4,58,"<h2>The Command to Return the Trusts to Whomever They Are Due</h2> Allah commands that the trusts be returned to their rightful owners. Al-Hasan narrated that Samurah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «أَدِّ الْأَمَانَةَ إِلى مَنِ ائْتَمَنَكَ، وَلَا تَخُنْ مَنْ خَانَك»  (Return the trust to those who entrusted you, and do not betray those who betrayed you.) Imam Ahmad and the collectors of Sunan recorded this Hadith. This command refers to all things that one is expected to look after, such as Allah's rights on His servants: praying, Zakah, fasting, penalties for sins, vows and so forth. The command also includes the rights of the servants on each other, such as what they entrust each other with, including the cases that are not recorded or documented. Allah commands that all types of trusts be fulfillled. Those who do not implement this command in this life, it will be extracted from them on the Day of Resurrection. It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «لَتُؤَدَّنَّ الْحُقُوقُ إِلى أَهْلِهَا حَتَّى يُقْتَصَّ لِلشَّاةِ الْجَمَّاءِ مِنَ الْقَرْنَاء»  (The rights will be rendered back to those to whom they are due, and even the sheep that does not have horns will take revenge from the horned sheep.) Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Jurayj said about this Ayah, \"It was revealed concerning `Uthman bin Talhah from whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ took the key of the Ka`bah and entered it on the Day of the victory of Makkah. When the Prophet went out, he was reciting this Ayah,  إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَن تُؤدُّواْ الاحَمَـنَـتِ إِلَى أَهْلِهَا  (Verily, Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due). He then called `Uthman and gave the key back to him.\" Ibn Jarir also narrated that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ went out of the Ka`bah, he was reciting this Ayah,  إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَن تُؤدُّواْ الاحَمَـنَـتِ إِلَى أَهْلِهَا  (Verily, Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due). May I sacrifice my father and mother for him, I never heard him recite this Ayah before that.\" It is popular that this is the reason behind revealing the Ayah (4:58). Yet, the application of the Ayah is general, and this is why Ibn `Abbas and Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah said, \"This Ayah is for the righteous and wicked,\" meaning it is a command that encompasses everyone. <h2>The Order to Be Just</h2> Allah said,  وَإِذَا حَكَمْتُمْ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ أَن تَحْكُمُواْ بِالْعَدْلِ  (and that when you judge between men, you judge with justice.) commanding justice when judging between people. Muhammad bin Ka`b, Zayd bin Aslam and Shahr bin Hawshab said; \"This Ayah was revealed about those in authority\", meaning those who judge between people. A Hadith states,  «إِنَّ اللهَ مَعَ الْحَاكِمِ مَا لَمْ يَجُرْ، فَإِذَا جَارَ وَكَلَهُ اللهُ إِلى نَفْسِه»  (Allah is with the judge as long as he does not commit injustice, for when he does, Allah will make him reliant on himself.) A statement goes, \"One day of justice equals forty years of worship.\" Allah said,  إِنَّ اللَّهَ نِعِمَّا يَعِظُكُمْ بِهِ  (Verily, how excellent is the teaching which He (Allah) gives you!) meaning, His commands to return the trusts to their owners, to judge between people with justice, and all of His complete, perfect and great commandments and laws. Allah's statement,  إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ سَمِيعاً بَصِيراً  (Truly, Allah is Ever All-Hearer, All-Seer.) means, He hears your statements and knows your actions. "
  4,59,"<h2>The Necessity of Obeying the Rulers in Obedience to Allah</h2> Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah,  أَطِيعُواْ اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُواْ الرَّسُولَ وَأُوْلِى الاٌّمْرِ مِنْكُمْ  (Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and those of you who are in authority.) \"Was revealed about `Abdullah bin Hudhafah bin Qays bin `Adi, who the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent on a military expedition.\" This statement was collected by the Group, with the exception of Ibn Majah At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan, Gharib\". Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ali said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent a troop under the command of a man from Al-Ansar. When they left, he became angry with them for some reason and said to them, `Has not the Messenger of Allah ﷺ commanded you to obey me' They said, `Yes.' He said, `Collect some wood,' and then he started a fire with the wood, saying, `I command you to enter the fire.' The people almost entered the fire, but a young man among them said, `You only ran away from the Fire to Allah's Messenger ﷺ. Therefore, do not rush until you go back to Allah's Messenger ﷺ, and if he commands you to enter it, then enter it.' When they went back to Allah's Messenger ﷺ , they told him what had happened, and the Messenger said,  «لَوْ دَخَلْتُمُوهَا مَا خَرَجْتُمْ مِنْهَا أَبَدًا، إِنَّمَا الطَّاعَةُ فِي الْمَعْرُوف»  (Had you entered it, you would never have departed from it. Obedience is only in righteousness.)\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Abu Dawud recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «السَّمْعُ وَالطَّاعَةُ عَلَى الْمَرْءِ الْمُسْلِمِ فِيمَا أَحَبَّ وَكَرِهَ، مَا لَمْ يُؤْمَرْ بِمَعْصِيَةٍ، فَإِذَا أُمِرَ بِمَعْصِيَةٍ فَلَا سَمْعَ وَلَا طَاعَة»  (The Muslim is required to hear and obey in that which he likes and dislikes, unless he was commanded to sin. When he is commanded with sin, then there is no hearing or obeying.) This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. `Ubadah bin As-Samit said, \"We gave our pledge to Allah's Messenger ﷺ to hear and obey (our leaders), while active and otherwise, in times of ease and times of difficulty, even if we were deprived of our due shares, and to not dispute this matter (leadership) with its rightful people. The Prophet said,  «إِلَّا أَنْ تَرَوْا كُفْرًا بَوَاحًا، عِنْدَكُمْ فِيهِ مِنَ اللهِ بُرْهَان»  (Except when you witness clear Kufr about which you have clear proof from Allah.)\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Another Hadith narrated by Anas states that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «اسْمَعُوا وَأَطِيعُوا، وَإِنْ أُمِّرَ عَلَيْكُمْ عَبْدٌحَبَشِيٌّ كَأَنَّ رَأْسَهُ زَبِيبَة»  (Hear and obey (your leaders), even if an Ethiopian slave whose head is like a raisin, is made your chief.) Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith. Umm Al-Husayn said that she heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ giving a speech during the Farewell Hajj, in which he said;  «وَلَوِ اسْتُعْمِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ عَبْدٌيَقُودُكُمْ بِكِتَابِ اللهِ، اسْمَعُوا لَهُ وَأَطِيعُوا»  (Even if a slave was appointed over you, and he rules you with Allah's Book, then listen to him and obey him.) Muslim recorded this Hadith. In another narration with Muslim, the Prophet said,  «عَبْدًا حَبَشِيًّا مَجْدُوعًا»  (Even if an Ethiopian slave, whose nose was mutilated...) In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «مَنْ أَطَاعَنِي فَقَدْ أَطَاعَ اللهَ، وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَقَدْ عَصَى اللهَ، وَمَنْ أَطَاعَ أَمِيرِي فَقَدْ أَطَاعَنِي، وَمَنْ عَصَى أَمِيرِي فَقَدْ عَصَانِي»  (Whoever obeys me, obeys Allah, and whoever disobeys me, disobeys Allah. Whoever obeys my commander, obeys me, and whoever disobeys my commander, disobeys me.) This is why Allah said,  أَطِيعُواْ اللَّهَ  (Obey Allah), adhere to His Book,  وَأَطِيعُواْ الرَّسُولَ  (and obey the Messenger), adhere to his Sunnah,  وَأُوْلِى الاٌّمْرِ مِنْكُمْ  (And those of you who are in authority) in the obedience to Allah which they command you, not what constitutes disobedience of Allah, for there is no obedience to anyone in disobedience to Allah, as we mentioned in the authentic Hadith,  «إِنَّمَا الطَّاعَةُ فِي الْمَعْرُوف»  (Obedience is only in righteousness.) <h2>The Necessity of Referring to the Qur'an and Sunnah for Judgment</h2> Allah said,  فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِى شَىْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ  ((And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger). Mujahid and several others among the Salaf said that the Ayah means, \"(Refer) to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger.\" This is a command from Allah that whatever areas the people dispute about, whether major or minor areas of the religion, they are required to refer to the Qur'an and Sunnah for judgment concerning these disputes. In another Ayah, Allah said,  وَمَا اخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِن شَىْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ  (And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allah). Therefore, whatever the Book and Sunnah decide and testify to the truth of, then it, is the plain truth. What is beyond truth, save falsehood This is why Allah said, u  إِن كُنتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ  (if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day.) meaning, refer the disputes and conflicts that arise between you to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger for judgment. Allah's statement,  إِن كُنتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ  (if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. ) indicates that those who do not refer to the Book and Sunnah for judgment in their disputes, are not believers in Allah or the Last Day. Allah said,  ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ  (That is better) meaning, referring to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger for judgment in various disputes is better,  وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلاً  (and more suitable for final determination.) meaning, \"Has a better end and destination,\" as As-Suddi and several others have stated while Mujahid said, \"Carries a better reward.\" "
