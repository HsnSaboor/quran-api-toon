  72,7,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2>﴾بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ﴿ (In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <h2>The Jinns listening to the Qur'an and Their Belief in It</h2> Allah commands His Messenger to inform his people that the Jinns listened to the Qur'an, believed in it, affirmed its truthfulness and adhered to it. So Allah says, ﴾قُلْ أُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ أَنَّهُ اسْتَمَعَ نَفَرٌ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ فَقَالُواْ إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا قُرْءَانَاً عَجَباً يَهْدِى إِلَى الرُّشْدِ﴿ (Say: \"It has been revealed to me that a group of Jinn listened. They said: `Verily, we have heard a wonderful Recitation! It guides to the right path\"') meaning, to what is correct and success. ﴾فَـَامَنَّا بِهِ وَلَن نُّشرِكَ بِرَبِّنَآ أَحَداً﴿ (and we have believed therein, and we shall never join anything with our Lord.) This position (that they took) is similar to what Allah said, ﴾وَإِذْ صَرَفْنَآ إِلَيْكَ نَفَراً مِّنَ الْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقُرْءَانَ﴿ (And when We sent towards you a group of the Jinns listening to the Qur'an.) (46:29) We have already presented the Hadiths that have been narrated concerning this, so there is no need to repeat them here. Concerning Allah's statement, ﴾وَأَنَّهُ تَعَـلَى جَدُّ رَبِّنَا﴿ (And He, exalted be the Jadd of our Lord,) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning Allah's statement, ﴾جَدُّ رَبِّنَا﴿ (the Jadd of our Lord,) \"This means, His actions, His commands and His power.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"Allah's Jadd is His blessings, His power and His favor upon His creation.\" It has been reported from Mujahid and `Ikrimah that they said, \"It (Jadd) is the magnificence of our Lord.\" Qatadah said, \"Exalted is His magnificence, His greatness and His command.\" As-Suddi said, \"Exalted is the command of our Lord.\" It has been reported from Abu Ad-Darda', Mujahid and Ibn Jurayj that they said, \"Exalted is His remembrance (Dhikr).\" <h2>The Jinns Affirmation that Allah does not have a Wife and Children</h2> Allah says, ﴾مَا اتَّخَذَ صَـحِبَةً وَلاَ وَلَداً﴿ (He has taken neither a wife nor a son.) meaning, far exalted is He above taking a mate and having children. This means that when the Jinns accepted Islam and believed in the Qur'an they professed Allah's magnificence above having taken a spouse and a child (or a son). Then they said, ﴾وَأَنَّهُ كَانَ يَقُولُ سَفِيهُنَا عَلَى اللَّهِ شَطَطاً ﴿ (And that the foolish among us used to utter against Allah that which was an enormity in falsehood.) Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah and As-Suddi, all said, ﴾سَفِيهُنَا﴿ (the foolish among us) \"They were referring to Iblis.\" ﴾شَطَطًا﴿ (that which was an enormity in falsehood.) As-Suddi reported from Abu Malik that he said, \"This means a transgression.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"A great injustice.\" The foolish (Safih) also carries the meaning of everyone in the category who claims that Allah has a spouse or a son. This is why Allah says here, ﴾وَأَنَّهُ كَانَ يَقُولُ سَفِيهُنَا﴿ (And that the foolish among us used to utter) meaning, nd He, eeA ? The Jinns Affirmation that Allah does not have a Wife and Children Allah says, ﴾مَا اتَّخَذَ صَـحِبَةً وَلاَ وَلَداً﴿ (He has taken neither a wife nor a son.) meaning, far exalted is He above taking a mate and having children. This means that when the Jinns accepted Islam and believed in the Qur'an they professed Allah's magnificence above having taken a spouse and a child (or a son). Then they said, ﴾وَأَنَّهُ كَانَ يَقُولُ سَفِيهُنَا عَلَى اللَّهِ شَطَطاً ﴿ (And that the foolish among us used to utter against Allah that which was an enormity in falsehood.) Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah and As-Suddi, all said, ﴾سَفِيهُنَا﴿ (the foolish among us) \"They were referring to Iblis.\" ﴾شَطَطًا﴿ (that which was an enormity in falsehood.) As-Suddi reported from Abu Malik that he said, \"This means a transgression.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"A great injustice.\" The foolish (Safih) also carries the meaning of everyone in the category who claims that Allah has a spouse or a son. This is why Allah says here, ﴾وَأَنَّهُ كَانَ يَقُولُ سَفِيهُنَا﴿ (And that the foolish among us used to utter) meaning, before his acceptance of Islam. ﴾عَلَى اللَّهِ شَطَطاً﴿ (against Allah that which was an enormity in falsehood.) meaning, falsehood and a lie. Thus, Allah says, ﴾وَأَنَّا ظَنَنَّآ أَن لَّن تَقُولَ الإِنسُ وَالْجِنُّ عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِباً ﴿ (And verily, we thought that men and Jinn would not utter a lie against Allah.) meaning, `we did not think that humans and Jinns would join each other in lying about Allah by attributing a spouse and a son to Him. So when we heard this Qur'an we believed in it and we knew that they (Jinns and men) had been lying about Allah in this matter.' <h2>Among the Causes of the Transgression of the Jinns were that Humans sought Refuge with Them</h2> Allah says, ﴾وَأَنَّهُ كَانَ رِجَالٌ مِّنَ الإِنسِ يَعُوذُونَ بِرِجَالٍ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ فَزَادوهُمْ رَهَقاً ﴿ (And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the Jinn, but they increased them in Rahaq.) meaning, `we used to think that we had some virtuous status over mankind because they used to seek refuge with us whenever they (men) would settle in a valley or any place in the wilderness, the open country steppes and other places.' This was the custom of the Arabs in the pre-Islamic days of ignorance. They used to seek refuge with the greatest Jinn of a particular place so that no harm or evil would afflict them. Like one would do if he entered into the land of his enemies, in the vicinity of a great and powerful man, he would seek the protection and guardianship of that man. So when the Jinns saw that the humans were seeking refuge with them due to their fear of them, they increased them in Rahaq which means fear, terror and fright. They did this so that the people would be more afraid of them and seek refuge with them even more. As Qatadah said concerning this Ayah, ﴾فَزَادوهُمْ رَهَقاً﴿ (but they increased them in Rahaq.) means, \"the Jinns were courageous and increased in insolence against them.\" As-Suddi said, \"A man used to set out with his family (on a journey) until he came to a piece of land where he would settle. Then he would say, `I seek refuge with the master (Jinn) of this valley from the Jinns, or that myself, my wealth, my child or my animals are harmed in it.\"' Qatadah said, \"When they sought refuge with them instead of Allah, the Jinns would overcome them with harm because of that.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from `Ikrimah that he said, \"The Jinns used to fear humans just like humans fear them, or even worse. So whenever humans would come to a valley the Jinns would flee. So the leader of the people would say, `We seek refuge with the leader of the inhabitants of this valley.' So the Jinns said, `We see these people fleeing from us just like we flee from them.' Thus, the Jinns started coming near the humans and afflicting them with insanity and madness.\" Thus, Allah said, ﴾وَأَنَّهُ كَانَ رِجَالٌ مِّنَ الإِنسِ يَعُوذُونَ بِرِجَالٍ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ فَزَادوهُمْ رَهَقاً ﴿ (And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the Jinn, but they increased them in Rahaq.) meaning, in sin. Abu `Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` and Zayd bin Aslam, all said, ﴾رَهَقاً﴿ (in Rahaq) \"This means in fear.\" Mujahid said, \"The disbelievers would increase in transgression.\" Concerning Allah's statement, ﴾وَأَنَّهُمْ ظَنُّواْ كَمَا ظَنَنتُمْ أَن لَّن يَبْعَثَ اللَّهُ أَحَداً ﴿ (And they thought as you thought,) means, \"the Jinns were courageous and increased in insolence against them.\" As-Suddi said, \"A man used to set out with his family (on a journey) until he came to a piece of land where he would settle. Then he would say, `I seek refuge with the master (Jinn) of this valley from the Jinns, or that myself, my wealth, my child or my animals are harmed in it.\"' Qatadah said, \"When they sought refuge with them instead of Allah, the Jinns would overcome them with harm because of that.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from `Ikrimah that he said, \"The Jinns used to fear humans just like humans fear them, or even worse. So whenever humans would come to a valley the Jinns would flee. So the leader of the people would say, `We seek refuge with the leader of the inhabitants of this valley.' So the Jinns said, `We see these people fleeing from us just like we flee from them.' Thus, the Jinns started coming near the humans and afflicting them with insanity and madness.\" Thus, Allah said, ﴾وَأَنَّهُ كَانَ رِجَالٌ مِّنَ الإِنسِ يَعُوذُونَ بِرِجَالٍ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ فَزَادوهُمْ رَهَقاً ﴿ (And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the Jinn, but they increased them in Rahaq.) meaning, in sin. Abu `Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` and Zayd bin Aslam, all said, ﴾رَهَقاً﴿ (in Rahaq) \"This means in fear.\" Mujahid said, \"The disbelievers would increase in transgression.\" Concerning Allah's statement, ﴾وَأَنَّهُمْ ظَنُّواْ كَمَا ظَنَنتُمْ أَن لَّن يَبْعَثَ اللَّهُ أَحَداً ﴿ (And they thought as you thought, that Allah will not send any Messenger.) meaning, Allah would never send a Messenger after this long period of time. This was said by Al-Kalbi and Ibn Jarir. "

  72,10,"<h2>The Jinns stealing Information from the Sky before the the Messenger ﷺ was sent and striking Them with flaming Fire after His Coming.</h2> Allah informs about the Jinns when He sent His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ and revealed the Qur'an to him. Among the ways He protected it (the Qur'an) was by filling sky with stern guards guarding it from all of its sides. The devils were then expelled from the places where they used to sit prior to that. This was so that they could not steal anything from the Qur'an and tell it to the soothsayers, thereby causing matters to be confused and mixed up. If this happened it would not be known who was being truthful. Allah did this out of His kindness to His creation, His mercy upon His servants and His protection of His Mighty Book (the Qur'an). This is why the Jinns said,  وَأَنَّا لَمَسْنَا السَّمَآءَ فَوَجَدْنَـهَا مُلِئَتْ حَرَساً شَدِيداً وَشُهُباً - وَأَنَّا كُنَّا نَقْعُدُ مِنْهَا مَقَـعِدَ لِلسَّمْعِ فَمَن يَسْتَمِعِ الاٌّنَ يَجِدْ لَهُ شِهَاباً رَّصَداً  (And we have sought to reach the heaven; but found it filled with stern guards and flaming fires. And verily, we used to sit there in stations, to (steal) a hearing, but any who listens now will find a flaming fire watching him in ambush.) meaning, whoever would like to steal some information by listening, he will find a flaming fire waiting in ambush for him. It will not pass him or miss him, but it will wipe him out and destroy him completely.  وَأَنَّا لاَ نَدْرِى أَشَرٌّ أُرِيدَ بِمَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ أَمْ أَرَادَ بِهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ رَشَداً  (And we know not whether evil is intended for those on earth, or whether their Lord intends for them guidance.) meaning, `we do not know if this -- the matter which has occurred in the sky -- is intended for those who are in the earth or if their Lord intends some guidance for them.' They stated this in such a manner out of their etiquette in phrasing their speech, because they did not attribute the doing of evil to anyone and they attributed the good to Allah. Verily, it has been recorded in the Sahih,  «وَالشَّرُّ لَيْسَ إِلَيْك»  (And evil is not attributed to You (Allah).) It used to be that shooting stars (meteors) occurred before this, however it did not happen much, rather only occasionally. As was reported in the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas when he said, \"While we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ a shooting star flashed in the sky. So the Prophet said,  «مَا كُنْتُمْ تَقُولُونَ فِي هَذَا؟»  (What did you all used to say about this) We replied, \"We used to say that a great person has been born and a great person has died.\" The Prophet said,  «لَيْسَ كَذَلِكَ، وَلَكِنَّ اللهَ إِذَا قَضَى الْأَمْرَ فِي السَّمَاء»  (This is not so, rather whenever Allah decrees a matter in the heaven...)\" and then he went on to narrate the rest of the Hadith which we have already mentioned in its entirety in Surah Saba'. This is what caused them to seek the reason for this occurrence. So they set out searching in the east and the west. Then they found the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reciting (the Qur'an) while leading his Companions in prayer. Thus, they knew that this Qur'an was the reason for the sky being guarded. Therefore, some among them believed in it and the others became more rebellious in their transgression. A discussion of this has preceded in a Hadith of Ibn `Abbas concerning Allah's statement in Surat Al-Ahqaf,  وَإِذْ صَرَفْنَآ إِلَيْكَ نَفَراً مِّنَ الْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقُرْءَانَ  (And (remember) when We sent towards you (Muhammad ﷺ) a group of the Jinn (quietly) listening to the Qur'an.) (46:29) There is no doubt that when so many shooting stars began appearing in the sky, it horrified humans and Jinns alike. They were very disturbed and alarmed by it. They thought that it was the destruction of the world. As-Suddi said, \"The sky was never guarded except if there was a Prophet in the earth or the religion of Allah was victorious and dominant in the earth.\" So the devils before the time of Muhammad ﷺ had taken sitting stations for themselves in the heaven of this world and they would listen to the matters that occurred in the heaven. But when Allah sent Muhammad ﷺ as a Prophet and Messenger, they were suddenly pelted one night (with the flaming, shooting stars). So the people of Ta'if were frightened because of this and they began to say, `The dwellers of the sky have been destroyed.' This was because they saw the severe fires in the sky and the shooting flames. They began freeing their servants and abandoning their luxuries. So `Abd Yalayl bin `Amr bin `Umayr said to them and he was referred to for judgement among them \"Woe to you O people of Ta'if! Hold on to your wealth and look at these guiding stars in the sky.If you see them remaining in their place, then the dwellers of the sky have not been destroyed, rather this has happened because of Ibn Abi Kabshah (-- meaning Muhammad ﷺ). And if you look and see that you can no longer see these stars, then verily the dwellers of the sky have been destroyed.\" So, they looked and saw that the stars still remained, and thus, they kept their wealth. The devils also were frightened during that night. They went to Iblis and informed him of what happened to them. So he (Iblis) said, \"Bring me a handful of dirt from every land so that I may smell it.\" So they brought it and he smelled it and said, \"It is your friend in Makkah.\" Then he sent a group of seven Jinns to Makkah, and they found the Prophet of Allah standing in prayer in Al-Masjid Al-Haram while reciting the Qur'an. They drew near to him eager to hear the Qur'an, until their chests almost pressed against him. Then they accepted Islam and Allah revealed their matter to His Messenger . We have mentioned this chapter in its entirety in the first section of the Kitab As-Sirah with lengthy discussion. Allah knows best and unto Him is all praise and blessings. "
