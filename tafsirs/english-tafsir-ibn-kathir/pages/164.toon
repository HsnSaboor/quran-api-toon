  7,106,"﴾وَقَالَ مُوسَى يَفِرْعَوْنُ إِنَّى رَسُولٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ ﴿ (And Musa said: \"O Fir`awn! Verily, I am a Messenger from the Lord of all that exists\".) meaning Musa said, `the one Who sent me is the Creator, Lord and King of all things,'  ﴾حَقِيقٌ عَلَى أَن لاَ أَقُولَ عَلَى اللَّهِ إِلاَّ الْحَقَّ﴿ (\"Proper it is for me that I say nothing concerning Allah but the truth. \") `It is incumbent and a duty for me to convey only the Truth from Him, because of what I know of His might and power.'  ﴾قَدْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِبَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ﴿ (\"Indeed I have come unto you from your Lord with a clear proof.\") `I brought unequivocal evidence that Allah gave me to prove that I am conveying the truth to you,'  ﴾فَأَرْسِلْ مَعِىَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ﴿ (\"So let the Children of Israel depart along with me.\") means, release them from your slavery and subjugation. Let them worship your Lord and their Lord. They are from the offspring of an honorable Prophet, Isra'il, who is Ya`qub son of Ishaq son of Ibrahim, the Khalil (intimate friend) of Allah.  ﴾قَالَ إِن كُنتَ جِئْتَ بِـَايَةٍ فَأْتِ بِهَآ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ ﴿ (Fir`awn said: \"If you have come with a sign, show it forth, if you are one of those who tell the truth.\") Fir`awn said, `I will not believe in what you have said nor entertain your request'. Therefore, he said, `if you have proof, then produce it for us to see, so that we know if your claim is true.'  "

  7,108,"﴾ثُعْبَانٌ مُّبِينٌ﴿ (a Thu`ban serpent, manifest), refers to \"The male snake.\" As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said similarly. A report from Ibn `Abbas said,  ﴾فَأَلْقَى عَصَاهُ﴿ \"(Then (Musa) threw his staff), and it turned into a huge snake that opened its mouth and rushed towards Fir`awn. When Fir`awn saw the snake rushing towards him, he jumped from his throne and cried to Musa for help, so that Musa would remove the snake from his way. Musa did that.\" As-Suddi commented,  ﴾فَإِذَا هِىَ ثُعْبَانٌ مُّبِينٌ﴿ (and behold! It was a Thu`ban serpent, manifest!) \"This Thu`ban refers to male snakes. The snake opened its mouth and headed towards Fir`awn to swallow him, placing its lower jaw on the ground and its upper jaw reaching the (top of the) wall of the palace. When Fir`awn saw the snake, he was frightened, so he jumped and wet himself and he never wet himself before this incident. He cried, `O Musa! Take it away and I will believe in you and release the Children of Israel to you.' So Musa, peace be on him, took it, and it became a staff again. \"  ﴾وَنَزَعَ يَدَهُ فَإِذَا هِىَ بَيْضَآءُ لِلنَّـظِرِينَ ﴿ (And he drew out his hand, and behold! it was white (with radiance) for the beholders.) Musa took his hand out of his cloak after he inserted his hand in it and it was shining, not because of leprosy or sickness. Allah said in another Ayah,  ﴾وَأَدْخِلْ يَدَكَ فِى جَيْبِكَ تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوءٍ﴿ (And put your hand into your bosom, it will come forth white without hurt.) 27:12 Ibn `Abbas said, \"without hurt', means, `not because of leprosy'. Musa inserted his hand again in his sleeve and it returned back to its normal color.\" Mujahid and several others said similarly.  "

  7,110,"<h2>Fir`awn's People say that Musa is a Magician!</h2> The chiefs and noblemen of the people of Fir`awn agreed with Fir`awn's statement about Musa. After Fir`awn felt safe and returned to his throne, he said to the chiefs of his people,  ﴾إِنَّ هَـذَا لَسَـحِرٌ عَلِيمٌ﴿ (This is indeed a well-versed sorcerer) and they agreed. They held counsel to decide what they should do about Musa. They conspired to extinguish the light that he brought and bring down his word. They plotted to portray Musa as a liar and fake. They feared that he might lure people to his side by his magic, they claimed, and thus prevail over them and drive them away from their land. What they feared occured, just as Allah said,  ﴾وَنُرِىَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَهَـمَـنَ وَجُنُودَهُمَا مِنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَحْذَرونَ﴿ (And We let Fir`awn and Haman and their hosts receive from them that which they feared.) 28:6 After they conferred about Musa, they agreed on a plot, as Allah said about them,  "

  7,112,"﴾أَرْجِهْ﴿ (\"Put him off\"), means, \"delay him (for a time).\"  ﴾وَأَرْسِلْ فِى الْمَدَآئِنِ﴿ (\"and send to the cities\"), areas and provinces of your kingdom -- O Fir`awn,  ﴾حَـشِرِينَ﴿ (\"to collect\") to gather magicians from various lands. At this time, magic was the trade of the day and it was widespread and popular. They had the idea that what Musa brought was a type of magic similar to the magic that the sorcerers of their time practiced. Because of this incorrect assumption, they brought all the magicians in order to defeat the miracles that he showed them. Allah said about Fir`awn,  ﴾فَلَنَأْتِيَنَّكَ بِسِحْرٍ مِّثْلِهِ فَاجْعَلْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكَ مَوْعِداً لاَّ نُخْلِفُهُ نَحْنُ وَلاَ أَنتَ مَكَاناً سُوًى ﴿﴾قَالَ مَوْعِدُكُمْ يَوْمُ الزِّينَةِ وَأَن يُحْشَرَ النَّاسُ ضُحًى - فَتَوَلَّى فِرْعَوْنُ فَجَمَعَ كَيْدَهُ ثُمَّ أَتَى ﴿ (Then verily, we can produce magic the like thereof; so appoint a meeting between us and you, which neither we nor you shall fail to keep, in an open place where both shall have a just and equal chance.\" Musa said: \"Your appointed meeting is the day of the festival, and let the people assemble when the sun has risen (forenoon).\" So Fir`awn withdrew, devised his plot and then came back.) 20:58-60. Allah said,  "

  7,114,"<h2>The Magicians convene and change Their Ropes into Snakes before Musa</h2> Allah describes the conversation that took place between Fir`awn and the magicians he collected to defeat Musa, peace be upon him. Fir`awn told them that he will reward them and give them tremendous provisions. He made them hope in acquiring what they wished for and to make them among his private audience and best associates. When they were assured of the cursed Fir`awn's promises,  "

  7,116,"﴾إِمَّآ أَن تُلْقِىَ وَإِمَّآ أَن نَّكُونَ نَحْنُ الْمُلْقِينَ﴿ (Either you throw (first), or shall we have the (first) throw) before you. In another Ayah, they said,  ﴾وَإِمَّآ أَن نَّكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَلْقَى﴿ (Or we be the first to throw) 20:65. Musa said to them, you throw first. It was said that the wisdom behind asking them to throw first, is that - Allah knows best - the people might witness the magicians' sorcery first. When the magicians had cast their spell and captured the eyes, the clear and unequivocal truth came, at a time when they all anticipated and waited for it to come, thus making the truth even more impressive to their hearts. This is what happened. Allah said,  ﴾فَلَمَّآ أَلْقُوْاْ سَحَرُواْ أَعْيُنَ النَّاسِ وَاسْتَرْهَبُوهُمْ﴿ (So when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them,) meaning, they deceived the eyes and made them think that thet trick was real, when it was only an illusion, just as Allah said,  ﴾فَأَوْجَسَ فِى نَفْسِهِ خِيفَةً مُّوسَى - قُلْنَا لاَ تَخَفْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الاٌّعْلَى - وَأَلْقِ مَا فِى يَمِينِكَ تَلْقَفْ مَا صَنَعُواْ إِنَّمَا صَنَعُواْ كَيْدُ سَاحِرٍ وَلاَ يُفْلِحُ السَّـحِرُ حَيْثُ أَتَى ﴿ (So Musa conceived fear in himself. We (Allah) said: \"Fear not! Surely, you will have the upper hand. And throw that which is in your right hand! It will swallow up that which they have made. That which they have made is only a magician's trick, and the magician will never be successful, to whatever amount (of skill) he may attain\") 20:67-69. Ibn `Abbas commented that the magicians threw, \"Thick ropes and long sticks, and they appeared to be crawling, an illusion that they created with their magic.\"  "
