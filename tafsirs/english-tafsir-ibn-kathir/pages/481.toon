tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  41,39,"<h2>From among the Signs of Allah</h2> Here Allah reminds His Creation of His power, and that He is the One Who has no equal, and He is Able to do all things. Allah's saying; ﴾وَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ الَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ﴿ (And from among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon.) means, He created the night with its darkness and the day with its light, and they alternate without ceasing. And He created the sun with its shining light, and the moon with its reflected light. and He allotted their stages and gave them separate orbits in the heavens, so that by the variations in their movements man may know the stages of night and day, of weeks, months and years, and time periods related to people's rights, acts of worship and various transactions. Moreover, because the sun and moon are the most beautiful of the heavenly bodies that can be seen in both the upper and lower realms, Allah points out that they are created entities which are in a state of enthrallment to Him, subject to His dominion and control. So He says: ﴾لاَ تَسْجُدُواْ لِلشَّمْسِ وَلاَ لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُواْ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ﴿ (Do not prostrate yourselves to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate yourselves to Allah Who created them, if you (really) worship Him.) meaning, `do not associate anything in worship with Him, for your worship of Him will be of no benefit to you if you worship others alongside Him, because He does not forgive the association of others in worship with Him.' He says: ﴾فَإِنِ اسْتَكْبَرُواْ﴿ (But if they are too proud, ) i.e., to worship Him Alone, and they insist on associating others with Him, ﴾فَالَّذِينَ عِندَ رَبِّكَ﴿ (then there are those who are with your Lord) i.e., the angels, ﴾يُسَبِّحُونَ لَهُ بِاللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ وَهُمْ لاَ يَسْـَمُونَ﴿ (glorify Him night and day, and never are they tired.) This is like the Ayah: ﴾فَإِن يَكْفُرْ بِهَا هَـؤُلاءِ فَقَدْ وَكَّلْنَا بِهَا قَوْماً لَّيْسُواْ بِهَا بِكَـفِرِينَ﴿ (But if these disbelieve therein, then, indeed We have entrusted it to a people who are not disbelievers therein.) (6:89). ﴾وَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ﴿ (And among His signs) means, signs of His ability to bring the dead back to life. ﴾أَنَّكَ تَرَى الاٌّرْضَ خَـشِعَةً﴿ (that you see the earth barren,) means, lifeless, with nothing growing in it; it is dead. ﴾فَإِذَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَآءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ﴿ (but when We send down water (rain) to it, it is stirred to life and growth.) means, it brings forth all kinds of crops and fruits. ﴾إِنَّ الَّذِى أَحْيَـهَا لَمُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى إِنَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ﴿ (Verily, He Who gives it life, surely is able to give life to the dead. Indeed He is Able to do all things.) "

  41,43,"<h2>The Punishment of the Deniers and the Description of the Qur'an</h2>﴾إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِى ءَايَـتِنَا﴿ (Verily, Yulhiduna Fi Our Ayat) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Al-Ilhad means putting words in their improper places.\" Qatadah and others said, \"It means disbelief and obstinate behavior.\" ﴾لاَ يَخْفَوْنَ عَلَيْنَآ﴿ (are not hidden from Us.) This is a stern warning and dire threat, stating that He, may He be exalted, knows who denies His signs, Names and attributes, and He will punish them for that. He says: ﴾أَفَمَن يُلْقَى فِى النَّارِ خَيْرٌ أَم مَّن يَأْتِى ءَامِناً يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ﴿ (Is he who is cast into the Fire better or he who comes secure on the Day of Resurrection) means, are these two equal They are not equal. Then Allah warns the disbelievers: ﴾اعْمَلُواْ مَا شِئْتُمْ﴿ (Do what you will.) Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and `Ata' Al-Khurasani said that ﴾اعْمَلُواْ مَا شِئْتُمْ﴿ (Do what you will. ) is a threat. Meaning, `do what you will of good or evil, for He knows and sees all that you do.' He says: ﴾إِنَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ﴿ (Verily, He is All-Seer of what you do.) ﴾إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِالذِّكْرِ لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ﴿ (Verily, those who disbelieved in the Reminder when it came to them.) Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi and Qatadah said, \"This is the Qur'an.\" ﴾وَإِنَّهُ لَكِتَـبٌ عَزِيزٌ﴿ (And verily, it is an honorable well-fortified respected Book.) means, it is protected and preserved, and nobody can produce anything like it. ﴾لاَّ يَأْتِيهِ الْبَـطِلُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَلاَ مِنْ خَلْفِهِ﴿ (Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it,) means, there is no way to corrupt it, because it has been sent down by the Lord of the worlds. Allah says: ﴾تَنزِيلٌ مِّنْ حَكِيمٍ حَمِيدٍ﴿ ((it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise.) meaning, He is Wise in all that He says and does, Praiseworthy in all that He commands and forbids; everything that He does is for praiseworthy purposes and its consequences will be good. ﴾مَّا يُقَالُ لَكَ إِلاَّ مَا قَدْ قِيلَ لِلرُّسُلِ مِن قَبْلِكَ﴿ (Nothing is said to you except what was said to the Messengers before you.) Qatadah, As-Suddi and others said, \"Nothing is said to you by way of rejection and disbelief, that was not said to the Messengers who came before you. Just as you have been rejected, they were also rejected. Just as they bore their people's insults with patience, so too you must bear your people's insults with patience.\" ﴾وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ﴿ (Verily, your Lord is the Possessor of forgiveness,) means, for those who turn to Him in repentance. ﴾وَذُو عِقَابٍ أَلِيمٍ﴿ (and (also) the Possessor of painful punishment.) means, for those who persist in disbelief, transgression and stubborn opposition. "

  41,45,"<h2>Rejection of the Qur'an is pure Stubbornness</h2> Allah tells us that the Qur'an is so eloquent and perfect in its wording and meanings, yet despite that the idolators do not believe in it. He tells us that their disbelief is the disbelief of stubbornness, as He says elsewhere: ﴾وَلَوْ نَزَّلْنَـهُ عَلَى بَعْضِ الاٌّعْجَمِينَ ﴿﴾فَقَرَأَهُ عَلَيْهِم مَّا كَانُوا بِهِ مُؤْمِنِينَ ﴿ (And if We had revealed it unto any of the non-Arabs, and he had recited it unto them, they would not have believed in it.) (26:198-199). If the Qur'an had been revealed in the language of the non-Arabs, they would have said, because of their stubbornness: ﴾لَوْلاَ فُصِّلَتْ ءَايَـتُهُ ءَاعْجَمِىٌّ وَعَرَبِىٌّ﴿ (Why are not its verses explained in detail What! not in Arabic and an Arab) meaning, why is it not revealed in detail in Arabic And by way of denunciation they would have said, \"What! not in Arabic nor from an Arab -- i.e., how can foreign words be revealed to an Arab who does not understand them This interpretation was reported from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, As-Suddi and others. ﴾قُلْ هُوَ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ هُدًى وَشِفَآءٌ﴿ (Say: \"It is for those who believe, a guide and a cure...\") means, `say, O Muhammad: this Qur'an, for the one who believes in it, is guidance for his heart and a cure for the doubts and confusion that exists in people's hearts.' ﴾وَالَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ فِى ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرٌ﴿ (And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness in their ears,) means, they do not understand what is in it. ﴾وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِمْ عَمًى﴿ (and it is blindness for them.) means they are not guided to the explanations contained therein. This is like the Ayah: ﴾وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ الْقُرْءَانِ مَا هُوَ شِفَآءٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلاَ يَزِيدُ الظَّـلِمِينَ إَلاَّ خَسَارًا ﴿ (And We send down of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe, and it increases the wrongdoers nothing but loss.) (17:82). ﴾أُوْلَـئِكَ يُنَادَوْنَ مِن مَّكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ﴿ (They are called from a place far away.) Mujahid said, \"Far away from their hearts.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"It is as if the one who is addressing them is calling to them from a distant place, and they cannot understand what he is saying.\" This is like the Ayah: ﴾وَمَثَلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ كَمَثَلِ الَّذِى يَنْعِقُ بِمَا لاَ يَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ دُعَآءً وَنِدَآءً صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْىٌ فَهُمْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ ﴿ (And the example of those who disbelieve is as that of him who shouts to those (flock of sheep) that hears nothing but calls and cries. (They are) deaf, dumb and blind. So they do not understand.) (2:171) <h2>Taking Musa as an Example</h2>﴾وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَـبَ فَاخْتُلِفَ فِيهِ﴿ (And indeed We gave Musa the Scripture, but dispute arose therein.) means, they disbelieved in him and did not show him any respect. ﴾فَاصْبِرْ كَمَا صَبَرَ أُوْلُواْ الْعَزْمِ مِنَ الرُّسُلِ﴿ (Therefore be patient as did the Messengers of strong will) (46:35). ﴾وَلَوْلاَ كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِن رَّبِّكَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى﴿ (And had it not been for a Word that went forth before from your Lord,) i.e., to delay the Reckoning until the Day of Resurrection, ﴾لَّقُضِىَ بِيْنَهُمْ﴿ (the matter would have been settled between them.) means, the punishment would have been hastened for them. But they have an appointed time, beyond which they will find no escape. ﴾وَإِنَّهُمْ لَفِى شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مُرِيبٍ﴿ (But truly, they are in grave doubt thereto.) means, their words of disbelief are not due to any wisdom or insight on their part; rather they spoke without any attempt at examining it thoroughly. This was also the interpretation of Ibn Jarir, and it is a plausible interpretation. And Allah knows best. "
