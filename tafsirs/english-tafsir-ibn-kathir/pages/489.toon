  42,53,"<h2>How the Revelation comes down</h2> This refers to how Allah sends revelation. Sometimes He casts something into the heart of the Prophet , and he has no doubt that it is from Allah, as it was reported in Sahih Ibn Hibban that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «إِنَّ رُوْحَ الْقُدُسِ نَفَثَ فِي رُوعِي أَنَّ نَفْسًا لَنْ تَمُوتَ حَتْى تَسْتَكْمِلَ رِزْقَهَا وَأَجَلَهَا، فَاتَّقُوا اللهَ وَأَجْمِلُوا فِي الطَّلَب»  (Ar-Ruh Al-Qudus i.e., Jibril breathed into my heart that no soul will die until its allotted provision and time have expired, so have Taqwa of Allah and keep seeking in a good (and lawful) way.)  أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ  (or from behind a veil) -- as He spoke to Musa, peace be upon him. He asked to see Him after He had spoken to him, but this was not granted to him. In the Sahih, it recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Jabir bin `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him:  «مَا كَلَّمَ اللهُ أَحَدًا إِلَّا مِنْ وَرَاءِ حِجَابٍ، وَإِنَّهُ كَلَّمَ أَبَاكَ كِفَاحًا»  (Allah never speaks to anyone except from behind a veil, but He spoke to your father directly.) This is how it was stated in the Hadith. He Jabir's father was killed on the day of Uhud, but this refers to the realm of Al-Barzakh, whereas the Ayah speaks of this earthly realm.  أَوْ يُرْسِلَ رَسُولاً فَيُوحِىَ بِإِذْنِهِ مَا يَشَآءُ  (or (that) He sends a Messenger to reveal what He wills by His leave.) as Jibril, peace be upon him, and other angels came down to the Prophets, peace be upon them.  إِنَّهُ عَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ  (Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise.) He is Most High, All-Knowing, Most Wise.  وَكَذَلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ رُوحاً مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا  (And thus We have sent to you Ruh of Our command.) means, the Qur'an.  مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِى مَا الْكِتَـبُ وَلاَ الإِيمَـنُ  (You knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith.) means, `in the details which were given to you in the Qur'an.'  وَلَـكِن جَعَلْنَـهُ  (But We have made it) means, the Qur'an,  نُوراً نَّهْدِى بِهِ مَن نَّشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا  (a light wherewith We guide whosoever of Our servants We will. ) This is like the Ayah:  قُلْ هُوَ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ هُدًى وَشِفَآءٌ وَالَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ فِى ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرٌ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِمْ عَمًى  (Say: \"It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Qur'an) is blindness for them.\") (41:44).  وَأَنَّكَ  (And verily, you) means, `O Muhammad,'  لَتَهْدِى إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ  (are indeed guiding to a straight path.) means, the correct behavior. Then Allah explains this further by saying:  صِرَطِ اللَّهِ  (The path of Allah) meaning, His Laws which He enjoins.  الَّذِى لَهُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ  (to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth.) means, their Lord and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling and ruling them, Whose decree cannot be overturned.  أَلاَ إِلَى اللَّهِ تَصِيرُ الاٍّمُورُ  (Verily, all matters at the end go to Allah.) means, all matters come back to Him and He issues judgement concerning them. Glorified and exalted be He far above all that the evildoers and deniers say. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Ash-Shura "

  43,8,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2>﴾بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ﴿  In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful ﴾حـم - تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ مِنَ اللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ ﴿ (Ha-Mim. By the manifest Book.) means, plain and clear in both wording and meaning, because it was revealed in the language of the Arabs, which is the most eloquent language for communication among people. Allah says: ﴾إِنَّا جَعَلْنَـهُ﴿ (Verily, We have made it) meaning, revealed it, ﴾قُرْءَاناً عَرَبِيّاً﴿ (a Qur'an in Arabic) meaning, in the language of the Arabs, eloquent and clear; ﴾لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ﴿ (that you may be able to understand.) means, that you may understand it and ponder its meanings. This is like the Ayah: ﴾بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِىٍّ مُّبِينٍ ﴿ (In the plain Arabic language.) (26:195) ﴾وَإِنَّهُ فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ ﴿ (And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book with Us, indeed exalted, full of wisdom.) This explains the high status of the Qur'an among the hosts on high (the angels), so that the people of earth will respect it, venerate it and obey it. ﴾وَأَنَّهُ﴿ (And verily, it) means, the Qur'an, ﴾فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ﴿ (is in the Mother of the Book) meaning, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet). This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid. ﴾لَدَيْنَآ﴿ (with Us,) means, in Our presence. This was the view of Qatadah and others. ﴾لَّعَلِّى﴿ (indeed exalted) means, occupying a position of honor and virtue. This was the view of Qatadah. ﴾حَكِيمٌ﴿ (full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere: ﴾إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ ﴿ (That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation. In a Book well-guarded. Which none can touch but the pure. A revelation from the Lord of the all that exists.) (56:77-80) ﴾كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُ فَى صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍ بِأَيْدِى سَفَرَةٍ كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ ﴿ (Nay, indeed it is an admonition. So whoever wills, let him pay attention to it. (It is) in Records held (greatly) in honor, exalted, purified, in the hands of scribes (angels), honorable and obedient.) (80:11-16) ﴾أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً أَن كُنتُمْ قَوْماً مُّسْرِفِينَ ﴿ (Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you, because you are a people excessive.) means, `do you think that We will forgive you and not punish you, when you do not do as you have been commanded' This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Abu Salih, Mujahid and As-Suddi, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir. ﴾أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً﴿ (Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you,) Qatadah said, \"By Allah, if this Qur'an had been taken away when the first generations of this Ummah rejected it, they would have been doomed, but Allah by His mercy persisted in sending it and calling them to it for twenty years, or for as long as He willed.\" What Qatadah said is very good, and his point is that Allah, by His grace and mercy towards His creation, did not stop calling them to the truth and to the wise Reminder, i.e., the Qur'an, even though they were heedless and turned away from it. Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.  (In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.) <h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2> Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience. ﴾وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ ﴿ (And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old. ﴾وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ ﴿ (And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him. ﴾فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً﴿ (Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah: ﴾أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً﴿ (Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82). And there are many similar Ayat. ﴾وَمَضَى مَثَلُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ﴿ (and the example of the ancients has passed away. ) Mujahid said, \"The way of their life.\" Qatadah said, \"Their punishment.\" Others said, \"Their lesson,\" i.e., `We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same end as them,' as in the Ayah at the end of this Surah: ﴾فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ ﴿ (And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) (43:56); ﴾سُنَّةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى قَدْ خَلَتْ فِى عِبَادِهِ﴿ (this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His servants) (40:85). ﴾وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ اللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً﴿ (and you will not find any change in the way of Allah.) (33:62) "
