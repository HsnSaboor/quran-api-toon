  3,85,"<h2>The Only Valid Religion To Allah is Islam</h2> Allah rebukes those who prefer a religion other than the religion that He sent His Books and Messengers with, which is the worship of Allah Alone without partners, to Whom, ﴾وَلَهُ أَسْلَمَ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ﴿ (submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth,) Willingly, or not. Allah said in other Ayat, ﴾وَللَّهِ يَسْجُدُ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ طَوْعًا وَكَرْهًا﴿ (And unto Allah (Alone) falls in prostration whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly.) 13:15, and, ﴾أَوَ لَمْيَرَوْاْ إِلَىخَلَقَ اللَّهُ مِن شَىْءٍ يَتَفَيَّأُ ظِلَـلُهُ عَنِ الْيَمِينِ وَالْشَّمَآئِلِ سُجَّدًا لِلَّهِ وَهُمْوَلِلَّهِ يَسْجُدُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ مِن دَآبَّةٍ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَهُمْ لاَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ يَخَـفُونَ رَبَّهُمْ مِّن فَوْقِهِمْ وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُؤْمَرُونَ ﴿ (Have they not observed things that Allah has created: (how) their shadows incline to the right and to the left, making prostration unto Allah, and they are lowly And to Allah prostrate all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, of the moving creatures and the angels, and they are not proud. They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded) 16: 48-50.  Therefore, the faithful believer submits to Allah in heart and body, while the disbeliever unwillingly submits to Him in body only, since he is under Allah's power, irresistible control and mighty kingship that cannot be repelled or resisted. Waki` reported that Mujahid said that the Ayah, ﴾وَلَهُ أَسْلَمَ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ طَوْعًا وَكَرْهًا﴿ (While to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly), is similar to the Ayah, ﴾وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ﴿ (And verily, if you ask them: \"Who created the heavens and the earth\" Surely, they will say: \"Allah\") 39:38.  He also reported that Ibn `Abbas said about, ﴾وَلَهُ أَسْلَمَ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ طَوْعًا وَكَرْهًا﴿ (while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly.)  \"When He took the covenant from them.\" ﴾وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُونَ﴿ (And to Him shall they all be returned) on the Day of Return, when He will reward or punish each person according to his or her deeds.  Allah then said, ﴾قُلْ ءَامَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا﴿ (Say: \"We believe in Allah and in what has been sent down to us) the Qur'an, ﴾وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَى إِبْرَهِيمَ وَإِسْمَـعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ﴿ (and what was sent down to Ibrahim, Ismai`0l, Ishaq, Ya`qub) the scriptures and revelation, ﴾وَالأَسْبَاطَ﴿ (and the Asbat,) the Asbat are the twelve tribes who originated from the twelve children of Israel (Ya`qub). ﴾وَمَا أُوتِىَ مُوسَى وَعِيسَى﴿ (and what was given to Musa, `Isa) the Tawrah and the Injil, ﴾وَالنَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ﴿ (and the Prophets from their Lord.) and this encompasses all of Allah's Prophets. ﴾لاَ نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ﴿ (We make no distinction between one another among them) we believe in all of them, ﴾وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ﴿ (And to Him (Allah) we have submitted (in Islam))  Therefore, faithful Muslims believe in every Prophet whom Allah has sent and in every Book He revealed, and never disbelieve in any of them. Rather, they believe in what was revealed by Allah, and in every Prophet sent by Allah. Allah said next, ﴾وَمَن يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ الإِسْلَـمِ دِينًا فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ﴿ (And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him,) whoever seeks other than what Allah has legislated, it will not be accepted from him, ﴾وَهُوَ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ مِنَ الْخَـسِرِينَ﴿ (and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.)  As the Prophet said in an authentic Hadith, ﴾«مَنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلًا لَيْسَ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرُنَا، فَهُوَ رَد»﴿ (Whoever commits an action that does not conform to our matter (religion) then it is rejected).

  3,89,"<h2>Allah Does Not Guide People Who Disbelieve After they Believed, Unless They Repent</h2> Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"A man from the Ansar embraced Islam, but later reverted and joined the polytheists. He later on became sorry and sent his people to, `Ask the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for me, if I can repent.' Then,  كَيْفَ يَهْدِى اللَّهُ قَوْمًا كَفَرُواْ بَعْدَ إِيمَـنِهِمْ  (How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief) until,  فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ  (Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) was revealed and his people sent word to him and he re-embraced Islam.\"  This is the wording recorded by An-Nasa'i, Al-Hakim and Ibn Hibban. Al-Hakim said, \"Its chain is Sahih and they did not record it.\"  Allah's statement,  كَيْفَ يَهْدِى اللَّهُ قَوْمًا كَفَرُواْ بَعْدَ إِيمَـنِهِمْ وَشَهِدُواْ أَنَّ الرَّسُولَ حَقٌّ وَجَآءَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَـتُ  (How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and after they bore witness that the Messenger is true and after clear proofs came to them)  means, the proofs and evidences were established, testifying to the truth of what the Messenger was sent with. The truth was thus explained to them, but they reverted to the darkness of polytheism. Therefore, how can such people deserve guidance after they willingly leapt into utter blindness This is why Allah said,  وَاللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِى الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ  (And Allah guides not the people who are wrongdoers.)  He then said,  أُوْلَـئِكَ جَزَآؤُهُمْ أَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ لَعْنَةَ اللَّهِ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةِ وَالنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ  (They are those whose recompense is that on them (rests) the curse of Allah, of the angels and of all mankind.)  Allah curses them and His creation also curses them.  خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ  (They will abide therein) in the curse,  لاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابُ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ  (Neither will their torment be lightened nor will it be delayed or postponed.) for, the torment will not be lessened, not even for an hour. After that, Allah said,  إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ تَابُواْ مِن بَعْدِ ذَلِكَ وَأَصْلَحُواْ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ  (Except for those who repent after that and do righteous deeds. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)  This Ayah indicates Allah's kindness, graciousness, compassion, mercy and favor on His creatures when they repent to Him, for He forgives them in this case. "

  3,91,"<h2>Neither Repentance of the Disbeliever Upon Death, Nor His Ransoming Himself on the Day of Resurrection Shall be Accepted</h2> Allah threatens and warns those who revert to disbelief after they believed and who thereafter insist on disbelief until death. He states that in this case, no repentance shall be accepted from them upon their death. Similarly, Allah said, ﴾وَلَيْسَتِ التَّوْبَةُ لِلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ السَّيِّئَـتِ حَتَّى إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَهُمُ الْمَوْتُ﴿ (And of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of them) 4:18.  This is why Allah said, ﴾لَّن تُقْبَلَ تَوْبَتُهُمْ وَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الضَّآلُّونَ﴿ (never will their repentance be accepted. And they are those who went astray.) to those who abandon the path of truth for the path of wickedness. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that some people embraced Islam, reverted to disbelief, became Muslims again, then reverted from Islam. They sent their people inquiring about this matter and they asked the Messenger of Allah . On that, this Ayah was revealed, ﴾إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بَعْدَ إِيمَـنِهِمْ ثُمَّ ازْدَادُواْ كُفْرًا لَّن تُقْبَلَ تَوْبَتُهُمْ﴿ (Verily, those who disbelieved after their belief and then went on increasing in their disbelief never will their repentance be accepted). The chain of narration is satisfactory. Thereafter, Allah said, ﴾إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَمَاتُواْ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْ أَحَدِهِم مِّلْءُ الاٌّرْضِ ذَهَبًا وَلَوِ افْتَدَى بِهِ﴿ (Verily, those who disbelieved, and died while they were disbelievers, the (whole) earth full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them even if they offered it as a ransom.)  Those who die while disbelievers, shall have no good deed ever accepted from them, even if they spent the earth's fill of gold in what was perceived to be an act of obedience. The Prophet was asked about `Abdullah bin Jud`an, who used to be generous to guests, helpful to the indebted and who gave food (to the poor); will all that benefit him The Prophet said, ﴾«لَا، إِنَّهُ لَمْ يَقُلْ يَوْمًا مِنَ الدَّهْرِ: رَبِّ اغْفِر لِي خَطِيئَتِي يَوْمَ الدِّين»﴿ (No, for not even one day during his life did he pronounce, `O my Lord! Forgive my sins on the Day of Judgment.)  Similarly, if the disbeliever gave the earth's full of gold as ransom, it will not be accepted from him. Allah said, ﴾وَلاَ يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلاَ تَنفَعُهَا شَفَـعَةٌ﴿ (...nor shall compensation be accepted from him, nor shall intercession be of use to him,)2:123, and ﴾لاَّ بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلاَ خِلَـلٌ﴿ (...on which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending.) 14:31, and, ﴾إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْ أَنَّ لَهُمْ مَّا فِى الاٌّرْضِ جَمِيعاً وَمِثْلَهُ مَعَهُ لِيَفْتَدُواْ بِهِ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ مَا تُقُبِّلَ مِنْهُمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ ﴿ (Verily, those who disbelieve, if they had all that is in the earth, and as much again therewith to ransom themselves thereby from the torment on the Day of Resurrection, it would never be accepted of them, and theirs would be a painful torment) 5:36.  This is why Allah said here, ﴾إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَمَاتُواْ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْ أَحَدِهِم مِّلْءُ الاٌّرْضِ ذَهَبًا وَلَوِ افْتَدَى بِهِ﴿ ,(Verily, those who disbelieved, and died while they were disbelievers, the (whole) earth full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them if they offered it as a ransom).  The implication of this Ayah is that the disbeliever shall never avoid the torment of Allah, even if he spent the earth's fill of gold, or if he ransoms himself with the earth's fill of gold, - all of its mountains, hills, sand, dust, valleys, forests, land and sea.  Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said, ﴾«يُؤْتَى بِالرَّجُلِ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ فَيَقُولُ لَهُ: يَا ابْنَ آدَمَ، كَيْفَ وَجَدْتَ مَنْزِلَكَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: أَيْ رَبِّ خَيْرَ مَنْزِلٍ، فَيَقُولُ: سَلْ وَتَمَنَّ، فَيَقُولُ: مَا أَسْأَلُ وَلَا أَتَمَنَّى إِلَّا أَنْ تَرُدَّنِي إِلَى الدُّنْيَا فَأُقْتَلَ فِي سَبِيلِكَ عَشْرَ مِرَارٍ، لِمَا يَرَى مِنْ فَضْلِ الشَّهَادَةِ، وَيُؤْتَى بِالرَّجُلِ مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ فَيَقُولُ لَهُ: يَا ابْنَ آدَمَ، كَيْفَ وَجَدْتَ مَنْزِلَكَ؟ فَيَقُولُ: يَا رَبِّ شَرَّ مَنْزِلٍ، فَيَقُولُ لَهُ: تَفْتَدِي مِنِّي بِطِلَاعِ الْأَرْضِ ذَهَبًا؟ فَيَقُولُ: أَيْ رَبِّ نَعَمْ، فَيَقُولُ: كَذَبْتَ، قَدْ سَأَلْتُكَ أَقَلَّ مِنْ ذَلِكَ وَأَيْسَرَ فَلَمْ تَفْعَلْ، فَيُرَدُّ إِلَى النَّار»﴿ (A man from among the people of Paradise will be brought and Allah will ask him, \"O son of Adam! How did you find your dwelling\" He will say, \"O Lord, it is the best dwelling.\" Allah will say, \"Ask and wish.\" The man will say, \"I only ask and wish that You send me back to the world so that I am killed ten times in Your cause,\" because of the honor of martyrdom he would experience. A man from among the people of the Fire will be brought, and Allah will say to him, \"O son of Adam! How do you find your dwelling\" He will say, \"It is the worst dwelling, O Lord.\" Allah will ask him, \"Would you ransom yourself from Me with the earth's fill of gold\" He will say, \"Yes, O Lord.\" Allah will say, \"You have lied. I asked you to do what is less and easier than that, but you did not do it,\" and he will be sent back to the Fire.)  This is why Allah said, ﴾أُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ﴿ (For them is a painful torment and they will have no helpers.) for they shall not have anyone who will save them from the torment of Allah or rescue them from His painful punishment.
