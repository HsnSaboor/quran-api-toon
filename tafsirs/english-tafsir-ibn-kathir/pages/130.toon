  6,21,"<h2>Allah is the Irresistible, Able to Bring Benefit and Protect from Harm</h2> Allah states that He Alone brings benefit or harm, and that He does what He wills with His creatures, none can resist His judgment or prevent what He decrees,  وَإِن يَمْسَسْكَ اللَّهُ بِضُرٍّ فَلاَ كَـشِفَ لَهُ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَإِن يَمْسَسْكَ بِخَيْرٍ فَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدُيرٌ  (And if Allah touches you with harm, none can remove it but He, and if He touches you with good, then He is able to do all things.) Similarly, Allah said,  مَّا يَفْتَحِ اللَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ مِن رَّحْمَةٍ فَلاَ مُمْسِكَ لَهَا وَمَا يُمْسِكْ فَلاَ مُرْسِلَ لَهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ  (Whatever mercy, Allah may grant to mankind, none can withhold it, and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it thereafter) 35:2. It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to supplicate,  «اللَّهُمَّ لَا مَانِعَ لِمَا أَعْطَيْتَ وَلَا مُعْطِيَ لِمَا مَنَعْتَ، وَلَا يَنْفَعُ ذَا الْجَدِّ مِنْكَ الْجَد»  (O Allah, there is none Who can avert what You grant or give what You deprive, and no fortune ever helps the fortunate against You.) This is why Allah said,  وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ  (And He is the Irresistible, above His servants,) meaning, to Him the necks are subservient, the tyrants humble before Him and He has complete control over all things. The creatures have all bowed to Allah and are humbled before His grace, honor, pride, greatness, highness and ability over all things. The creatures are insignificant before Him, for they are all under His irresistible decision and power,  وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ  (and He is the All-Wise,) in all His actions,  الْخَبِيرُ  (Well-Acquainted with all things.) Who places everything in its rightful place, grants and favors whomever deserves His favor. Allah said next,  قُلْ أَىُّ شَىْءٍ أَكْبَرُ شَهَـدةً  (Say: \"What thing is the most great in witness\") or what is the greatest witness,  قُلِ اللَّهِ شَهِيدٌ بِيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمْ  (Say: \"Allah (the Most Great!) is Witness between you and I\") for He knows what I brought you and what you will answer me with,  وَأُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ لاٌّنذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ  (this Qur'an has been revealed to me that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach.) Therefore, this Qur'an is a warner for all those who hear of it. In another Ayah, Allah said,  وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ  (But those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place.) 11:17 Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said, \"Those who follow the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ought to call to what the Messenger of Allah ﷺ called to and warn against what he warned against.\" Allah said next,  أَئِنَّكُمْ لَتَشْهَدُونَ  (\"Can you verily bear witness...\") O idolators,  أَنَّ مَعَ اللَّهِ ءَالِهَةً أُخْرَى قُل لاَّ أَشْهَدُ  (\"that besides Allah there are other gods\" Say, \"I bear no (such) witness!\") Similarly, in another Ayah, Allah said;  فَإِن شَهِدُواْ فَلاَ تَشْهَدْ مَعَهُمْ  (Then if they testify, testify not you with them.) 6:150 Allah said next,  قُلْ إِنَّمَا هُوَ إِلَـهٌ وَحِدٌ وَإِنَّنِى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ  (Say: \"Only He is God, alone, and truly I am innocent of what you join in worship with Him.\") <h2>People of the Book Recognize the Prophet Just as They Recognize Their Own Children</h2> Allah says, the People of the Book know what you brought them, O Muhammad , as they know their own children. This is because they received good news from the previous Messengers and Prophets about the coming of Muhammad ﷺ, his attributes, homeland, his migration, and the description of his Ummah. Allah said next,  الَّذِينَ خَسِرُواْ أَنفُسَهُم  (Those who have lost (destroyed) themselves) and thus incurred the ultimate loss,  فَهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ  (will not believe.) in this clear matter. A matter about which the previous Prophets gave good news, and a matter extolled about in ancient and modern times. Allah said next,  وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَى عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِباً أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِـَايَـتِهِ  (And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Ayat) meaning, there is no person more unjust than he who lies about Allah and claims that Allah has sent him, while Allah did not send him. There is no person more unjust than he who denies Allah's proofs, signs and evidences,  إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الظَّـلِمُونَ  (Verily, the wrongdoers shall never be successful.) Surely, both of these people will never acquire success, whoever falsely claims that Allah sent him and whoever refuses Allah's Ayat. "

  6,26,"<h2>The Polythiests Shall be Questioned About the Shirk They Committed</h2> About the polytheists, Allah said:  وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعاً  (And on the Day when We shall gather them all together,) This is on the Day of Resurrection, when He will ask them about the idols and rivals that they worshipped instead of Him. Allah will say to them,  أَيْنَ شُرَكَآؤُكُمُ الَّذِينَ كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ  (Where are your partners (false deities) whom you used to assert (as partners in worship with Allah)) Allah said in Surat Al-Qasas,  وَيَوْمَ يُنَـدِيهِمْ فَيَقُولُ أَيْنَ شُرَكَآئِىَ الَّذِينَ كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ  (And (remember) the Day when He will call to them, and say, \"Where are My (so-called) partners whom you used to assert\") 28:62. Allah's statement,  ثُمَّ لَمْ تَكُنْ فِتْنَتُهُمْ  (There will then be (left) no Fitnah for them) means, argument. `Ata' Al-Khurasani said that,  ثُمَّ لَمْ تَكُنْ فِتْنَتُهُمْ  (There will then be (left) no Fitnah for them) in the face of the affliction that will be placed on them,  إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ  (but to say: \"By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others (in worship with Allah).\") Allah said next,  انظُرْ كَيْفَ كَذَبُواْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ  (Look! How they lie against themselves! But the (lie) which they invented will disappear from them.) which is similar to His other statement,  ثُمَّ قِيلَ لَهُمْ أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تُشْرِكُونَ - مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ قَـالُواْ ضَـلُّواْ عَنَّا بَل لَّمْ نَكُنْ نَّدْعُواْ مِن قَبْلُ شَيْئاً كَذَلِكَ يُضِلُّ اللَّهُ الْكَـفِرِينَ  (Then it will be said to them: \"Where are (all) those whom you used to join in worship as partners. Besides Allah\" They will say, \"They have vanished from us: Nay, we did not invoke (worship) anything before.\" Thus Allah leads astray the disbelievers.) 40:73-74 <h2>The Miserable Do Not Benefit from the Qur'an</h2> Allah's statement,  وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَسْتَمِعُ إِلَيْكَ وَجَعَلْنَا عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ أَكِنَّةً أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ وَفِى ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْراً وَإِن يَرَوْاْ كُلَّ ءَايَةٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَا  (And of them there are some who listen to you; but We have set veils on their hearts, so they understand it not, and deafness in their ears; if they see every one of the Ayat they will not believe therein;) means, they come to you, (O Muhammad ), so that they hear you recite the Qur'an, but its recitation does not benefit them, because Allah has set veils on their hearts, and so they do not understand the Qur'an,  وَفِى ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرًا  (and (set) deafness in their ears;) that prevents them from hearing what benefits them. In another Ayah, Allah said;  وَمَثَلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ كَمَثَلِ الَّذِى يَنْعِقُ بِمَا لاَ يَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ دُعَآءً وَنِدَآءً  (And the example of those who disbelieve, is as that of him who shouts at one who hears nothing but calls and cries.) 2:171 Allah said next,  وَإِن يَرَوْاْ كُلَّ ءَايَةٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَا  (if they see every one of the Ayat they will not believe therein;) meaning, they will not believe in any of the Ayat, proofs, clear evidences and signs they witness because they do not have sound comprehension or fair judgment. In another Ayah, Allah said,  وَلَوْ عَلِمَ اللَّهُ فِيهِمْ خَيْرًا لأَسْمَعَهُمْ  (Had Allah known of any good in them, He would indeed have made them listen.) 8:23 Allah said,  حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءُوكَ يُجَـدِلُونَكَ  (to the point that when they come to you to argue with you...) using falsehood against truth,  يَقُولُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ أَسَـطِيرُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ  (those who disbelieve say: \"These are nothing but tales of the men of old.\") The disbelievers say, what you (O Muhammad ) brought us was taken from the books of those who were before us, meaning plagiarized,  وَهُمْ يَنْهَوْنَ عَنْهُ وَيَنْأَوْنَ عَنْهُ  (And they prevent others from him and they themselves keep away from him,) They discourage people from following the truth, believing in Muhammad ﷺ and obeying the Qur'an,  وَيَنْأَوْنَ عَنْهُ  (and they themselves keep away from him,) They thus combine both evil acts, for they neither benefit themselves, nor let others benefit from the Prophet . `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah,  وَهُمْ يَنْهَوْنَ عَنْهُ  (And they prevent others from him.) means, they hinder people from believing in Muhammad ﷺ. Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah said, \"The disbelievers of Quraysh used to refrain from meeting Muhammad and they discouraged people from coming to him.\" Similar was reported from Qatadah, Mujahid and Ad-Dahhak and several others.  وَإِن يُهْلِكُونَ إِلاَّ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ  (and (by doing so) they destroy not but themselves, yet they perceive (it) not.) They destroy themselves by committing this evil action, and its harm will only touch them. Yet, they do not perceive this fact! "
