  23,107,"<h2>Rebuking the People of Hell, their admission of Their Wretchedness and their Request to be brought out of Hell</h2> This is a rebuke from Allah to the people of Hell for the disbelief, sins, unlawful deeds and evil actions that they committed, because of which they were doomed. Allah says: ﴾أَلَمْ تَكُنْ ءَايَـتِى تُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ فَكُنْتُمْ بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ ﴿ (\"Were not My Ayat recited to you, and then you used to deny them\") meaning, `I sent Messengers to you, and revealed Books, and cleared the confusion for you, so you have no excuse.' This is like the Ayat: ﴾لِئَلاَّ يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى اللَّهِ حُجَّةٌ بَعْدَ الرُّسُلِ﴿ (in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the Messengers) 4:165 ﴾وَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولاً﴿ (And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger) 17:15. ﴾كُلَّمَا أُلْقِىَ فِيهَا فَوْجٌ سَأَلَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَآ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَذِيرٌ﴿ (Every time a group is cast therein, its keeper will ask: \"Did no warner come to you\") Until His saying; ﴾فَسُحْقًا لاًّصْحَـبِ السَّعِيرِ﴿ (So, away with the dwellers of the blazing Fire!) They will say: ﴾رَبَّنَا غَلَبَتْ عَلَيْنَا شِقْوَتُنَا وَكُنَّا قَوْماً ضَآلِّينَ﴿ (Our Lord! Our wretchedness overcame us, and we were (an) erring people.) meaning, evidence has been established against us, but we were so doomed that we could not follow it, so we went astray and were not guided. Then they will say: ﴾رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْهَا فَإِنْ عُدْنَا فَإِنَّا ظَـلِمُونَ ﴿ (Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If ever we return (to evil), then indeed we shall be wrongdoers.) meaning, send us back to the world, and if we go back to what we used to do before, then we will indeed be wrongdoers who deserve punishment. This is like the Ayat: ﴾فَاعْتَرَفْنَا بِذُنُوبِنَا فَهَلْ إِلَى خُرُوجٍ مِّن سَبِيلٍ﴿ (Now we confess our sins, then is there any way to get out) Until His statement: ﴾فَالْحُكْمُ للَّهِ الْعَلِـىِّ الْكَبِيرِ﴿ (So the judgment is only with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great!\") 40:11-12 meaning, there will be no way out, because you used to associate partners in worship with Allah whereas the believers worshipped Him Alone.

  23,111,"<h2>Allah's Response and Rejection of the Disbelievers</h2> This is the response of Allah to the disbelievers when they ask Him to bring them out of the Fire and send them back to this world. He will say: ﴾اخْسَئُواْ فِيهَا﴿ (Remain you in it with ignominy!) meaning, abide therein, humiliated, despised and scorned. ﴾وَلاَ تُكَلِّمُونِ﴿ (And speak you not to Me!) means, `do not ask for this again, for I will not respond to you. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning this Ayah, ﴾اخْسَئُواْ فِيهَا وَلاَ تُكَلِّمُونِ﴿ (Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you not to Me!) \"These are the words of Ar-Rahman when silencing them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, \"The people of Hell will call on Malik for forty years, and he will not answer them. Then he will respond and tell them that they are to abide therein. By Allah, their cries will mean nothing to Malik or to the Lord of Malik. Then they will call on their Lord and will say, ﴾قَالُواْ رَبَّنَا غَلَبَتْ عَلَيْنَا شِقْوَتُنَا وَكُنَّا قَوْماً ضَآلِّينَ - رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْهَا فَإِنْ عُدْنَا فَإِنَّا ظَـلِمُونَ ﴿ (Our Lord! Our wretchedness overcame us, and we were (an) erring people. Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If ever we return (to evil), then indeed we shall be wrongdoers.) 23:106-107 Allah will not answer them for a time span equivalent to twice the duration of this world. Then He will reply: ﴾اخْسَئُواْ فِيهَا وَلاَ تُكَلِّمُونِ﴿ (Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you not to Me!) By Allah, the people will not utter a single word after that, and they will merely be in the Fire of Hell, sighing in a high and low tone. Their voices are likened to those of donkeys, which start in a high tone and end in a low tone.\" Then Allah will remind them of their sins in this world and how they used to make fun of His believing servants and close friends: ﴾إِنَّهُ كَانَ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْ عِبَادِى يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ ءَامَنَّا فَاغْفِرْ لَنَا وَارْحَمْنَا وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ الرَحِمِينَ فَاتَّخَذْتُمُوهُمْ سِخْرِيّاً﴿ (Verily, there was a party of My servants who used to say: \"Our Lord! We believe, so forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are the Best of all who show mercy!\" But you took them for a laughing stock,) meaning, `you made fun of them for calling on Me and praying to Me,' ﴾حَتَّى أَنسَوْكُمْ ذِكْرِى﴿ (so much so that they made you forget My remembrance) means, your hatred for them made you forget what I would do to you. ﴾وَكُنْتُمْ مِّنْهُمْ تَضْحَكُونَ﴿ (while you used to laugh at them!) means, at their deeds and worship. This is like the Ayah: ﴾إِنَّ الَّذِينَ أَجْرَمُواْ كَانُواْ مِنَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ يَضْحَكُونَ - وَإِذَا مَرُّواْ بِهِمْ يَتَغَامَزُونَ ﴿ (Verily, those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed. And, whenever they passed by them, used to wink one to another.) 83:29-30 meaning, they used to slander them in mockery. Then Allah tells us how He will reward His friends and righteous servants, and says: ﴾إِنِّى جَزَيْتُهُمُ الْيَوْمَ بِمَا صَبَرُواْ﴿ (Verily, I have rewarded them this Day for their patience;) meaning, `for the harm and mockery that you inflicted on them, ﴾أَنَّهُمْ هُمُ الْفَآئِزُونَ﴿ (they are indeed the ones that are successful.) I have caused them to attain the victory of joy, safety, Paradise and salvation from the Fire.' "

  23,116,"<h2>Allah tells them how much they wasted in their short lives in this world by failing to obey Allah and worship Him Alone.</h2> If they had been patient during their short stay in this world, they would have attained victory just like His pious close friends. ﴾قَـلَ كَمْ لَبِثْتُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ عَدَدَ سِنِينَ ﴿ (He will say: \"What number of years did you stay on earth\") means, how long did you stay in this world ﴾قَالُواْ لَبِثْنَا يَوْماً أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ فَاسْأَلِ الْعَآدِّينَ ﴿ (They will say: \"We stayed a day or part of a day. Ask of those who keep account.\") meaning, those who keep the records. ﴾قَالَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً﴿ (He will say: \"You stayed not but a little...\") meaning, it was only a short time, no matter how you look at it. ﴾لَّوْ أَنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ﴿ (if you had only known!) means, you would not have preferred the transient to the eternal, and treated yourself in this bad way, and earned the wrath of Allah in this short period. If you had patiently obeyed Allah and worshipped Him as the believers did, you would have attained victory just as they did. <h2>Allah did not create His Servants in vain</h2>﴾أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ عَبَثاً﴿ (Did you think that We had created you in play,) means, `did you think that you were created in vain, with no purpose, with nothing required of you and no wisdom on Our part' Or it was said that \"in play\" meant to play and amuse yourselves, like the animals were created, who have no reward or punishment. But you were created to worship Allah and carry out His commands. ﴾وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لاَ تُرْجَعُونَ﴿ (and that you would not be brought back to Us) means, that you would not be brought back to the Hereafter. This is like the Ayah: ﴾أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى ﴿ (Does man think that he will be left neglected) 75:36 ﴾فَتَعَـلَى اللَّهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ﴿ (So Exalted be Allah, the True King.) means, sanctified be He above the idea that he should create anything in vain, for He is the True King Who is far above doing such a thing. ﴾لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيمِ﴿ (None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of Al-`Arsh Al-Karim!) The Throne is mentioned because it is the highest point of all creation, and it is described as Karim, meaning beautiful in appearance and splendid in form, as Allah says elsewhere: ﴾أَنبَتْنَا فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ كَرِيمٍ﴿ (every good kind We cause to grow therein) 26:7. "

  23,118,"<h2>Shirk is the Worst form of Wrong, its Practitioner shall never succeed. Allah threatens those who associate anything else withHim and worship anything with Him. He informs that those whoassociate others with Allah:</h2>﴾لاَ بُرْهَانَ لَهُ﴿ (of whom he has no proof), meaning no evidence for what he says. Then Allah says: ﴾وَمَن يَدْعُ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهَا ءَاخَرَ لاَ بُرْهَانَ لَهُ بِهِ﴿ (And whoever invokes, besides Allah, any other god, of whom he has no proof;) this is a conditional sentence, whose fulfilling clause is: ﴾فَإِنَّمَا حِسَابُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ﴿ (then his reckoning is only with his Lord.) meaning, Allah will call him to account for that. Then Allah tells us: ﴾إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الْكَـفِرُونَ﴿ (Surely, disbelievers will not be successful.) meaning, they will not be successful with Him on the Day of Resurrection; they will not prosper or be saved. ﴾وَقُل رَّبِّ اغْفِرْ وَارْحَمْ وَأنتَ خَيْرُ الرَحِمِينَ ﴿ (And say: \"My Lord! Forgive and have mercy, for You are the best of those who show mercy!\") Here Allah is teaching us to recite this supplication, for forgiveness, in a general sense, means wiping away sins and concealing them from people, and mercy means guiding a person and helping him to say and do good things.
