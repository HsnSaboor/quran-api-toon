  31,7,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2>﴾بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ﴿	  In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful 	 <h2>The Doomed are preoccupied with Idle Talk and They turn away from the Ayat of Allah</h2> When Allah mentions the blessed -- who are those who are guided by the Book of Allah and benefit from hearing it, as He says: ﴾اللَّهُ نَزَّلَ أَحْسَنَ الْحَدِيثِ كِتَـباً مُّتَشَـبِهاً مَّثَانِيَ تَقْشَعِرُّ مِنْهُ جُلُودُ الَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ ثُمَّ تَلِينُ جُلُودُهُمْ وَقُلُوبُهُمْ إِلَى ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ﴿ (Allah has sent down the Best Statement, a Book, its parts resembling each other (and) oft-repeated. The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver from it. Then their skin and their heart soften to the remembrance of Allah) (39:23). He connect that with mention of the doomed, those who turn away from the Qur'an and do not benefit from hearing the Words of Allah. Instead, they turn to listening to flutes and singing accompanied by musical instruments. As Ibn Mas`ud commented about the Ayah: ﴾وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْتَرِى لَهْوَ الْحَدِيثِ لِيُضِلَّ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ﴿ (And of mankind is he who purchases Lahu Al-Hadith to mislead (men) from the path of Allah), he said, \"This -- by Allah -- refers to singing.\" ﴾وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْتَرِى لَهْوَ الْحَدِيثِ لِيُضِلَّ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ﴿ (And of mankind is he who purchases Lahw Al-Hadith to mislead (men) from the path of Allah without knowledge, ) Qatadah said: \"By Allah, he may not spend money on it, but his purchasing it means he likes it, and the more misguided he is, the more he likes it and the more he prefers falsehood to the truth and harmful things over beneficial things.\" It was said that what is meant by the words ﴾يَشْتَرِى لَهْوَ الْحَدِيثِ﴿ (purchases idle talks) is buying singing servant girls. Ibn Jarir said that it means all speech that hinders people from seeing the signs of Allah and following His path. His saying: ﴾لِيُضِلَّ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ﴿ (to mislead (men) from the path of Allah) means, he does this to oppose Islam and its followers. ﴾وَيَتَّخِذَهَا هُزُواً﴿ (and takes it by way of mockery.) Mujahid said, \"This means mocking the path of Allah and making fun of it.\" ﴾أُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ﴿ (For such there will be a humiliating torment.) Just as they showed no respect to the signs and path of Allah, so they will be shown no respect on the Day of Resurrection, and they will be subjected to a painful, ongoing torment. Then Allah says: ﴾وَإِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِ ءَايَـتُنَا وَلَّى مُسْتَكْبِراً كَأَن لَّمْ يَسْمَعْهَا كَأَنَّ فِى أُذُنَيْهِ وَقْراً﴿ (And when Our Ayat are recited to such a one, he turns away in pride, as if he heard them not -- as if there were deafness in his ear.) means, when these Qur'anic verses are recited to one who is fond of idleness and play, he turns away from them and does not want to hear them. He turns a deaf ear to them as if he can hear nothing, because it annoys him to hear them since he gains no benefit from them and has no interest in them. ﴾فَبَشِّرْهُ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ﴿ (So announce to him a painful torment.) i.e., on the Day of Resurrection, which will hurt him just as much as listening to the Book of Allah and its verses hurt him. "

  31,9,"<h2>The Good Destiny of the Believers</h2> Here Allah mentions the destiny of the righteous in the Hereafter, those who believe in Allah and His Messenger and do righteous deeds in accordance with the Laws of Allah. ﴾لَهُمْ جَنَّـتُ النَّعِيمِ﴿ (for them are Gardens of Delight.) means, there they will enjoy all kinds of delights and pleasures, food, drink, clothing, dwelling-places, means of transportation, women, a light of beauty and delightful sounds, which have never crossed the mind of any human being. They will stay there forever, never leaving and never desiring change. ﴾وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقًّا﴿ (It is a promise of Allah in truth.) meaning, this will undoubtedly come to pass, for it is a promise from Allah, and Allah never breaks His promise, because He is the Most Generous Bestower Who does what He wills and is able to do all things. ﴾وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ﴿ (And He is the All-Mighty,) Who has subjugated all things and to Whom all things submit, ﴾الْحَكِيمُ﴿ (the All-Wise.) in what He says and what He does, Who has made this Qur'an a guidance to the believers. ﴾قُلْ هُوَ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ هُدًى وَشِفَآءٌ وَالَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ فِى ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرٌ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِمْ عَمًى﴿ (Say: \"It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it is blindness for them) (41:44). ﴾وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ الْقُرْءَانِ مَا هُوَ شِفَآءٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلاَ يَزِيدُ الظَّـلِمِينَ إَلاَّ خَسَارًا ﴿ (And We send down of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe, and it increases the wrongdoers nothing but loss.) (17:82) "

  31,11,"<h2>Proofs of Tawhid</h2> Thus Allah explains His mighty power in creating the heavens and the earth, and everything that is within them and between them. He says: ﴾خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ بِغَيْرِ عَمَدٍ﴿ (He has created the heavens without any pillars) Al-Hasan and Qatadah said, \"It does not have any pillars, visible or invisible.\" ﴾وَأَلْقَى فِى الاٌّرْضِ رَوَاسِىَ﴿ (and has set on the earth firm mountains) means, the mountains which stabilize and lend weight to the earth, lest it should shake with its water. Allah says: ﴾أَن تَمِيدَ بِكُمْ﴿ (lest it should shake with you.) ﴾وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَآبَّةٍ﴿ (And He has scattered therein moving creatures of all kinds) means, He has placed throughout it all kinds of animals, the total number of whose kinds and colors is known to no one except the One Who created them. When Allah tells us that He is the Creator, He also reminds us that He is the Provider, as He says: ﴾وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَنْبَتْنَا فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ كَرِيمٍ﴿ (And We send down water from the sky, and We cause (plants) of every goodly kind to grow therein in pairs,) meaning, every kind of good produce in pairs, i.e., they are beautiful to look at. Ash-Sha`bi said: \"People are also produce of the earth, so whoever enters Paradise is goodly and whoever enters Hell is vile.\" ﴾هَـذَا خَلْقُ اللَّهِ﴿ (This is the creation of Allah.) means, all that Allah has mentioned here of the creation of the heavens and earth and everything in between stems from His power of creation and control alone, and He has no partner or associate in that, Allah says: ﴾فَأَرُونِى مَاذَا خَلَقَ الَّذِينَ مِن دُونِهِ﴿ (So, show Me that which those besides Him have created.) those idols and rivals whom you worship and call upon. ﴾بَلِ الظَّـلِمُونَ﴿ (Nay, the wrongdoers) means the idolators who associate others in worship with Allah ﴾فِى ضَلَـلٍ﴿ (in error) means, they are ignorant and blind. ﴾مُّبِينٌ﴿ (plain) means, it is clear and obvious, and not at all hidden.
