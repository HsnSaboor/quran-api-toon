  7,45,"<h2>People of Hellfire will feel Anguish upon Anguish</h2> Allah mentioned how the people of the Fire will be addressed, chastised and admonished when they take their places in the Fire,  ﴾قَدْ وَجَدْنَا مَا وَعَدَنَا رَبُّنَا حَقًّا فَهَلْ وَجَدتُّم مَّا وَعَدَ رَبُّكُمْ حَقًّا قَالُواْ نَعَمْ﴿ (\"We (dwellers of Paradise) have indeed found true what our Lord had promised us; have you (dwellers of Hell) also found true what your Lord promised (warned)\" They shall say: \"Yes.\") In Surat As-Saffat, Allah mentioned the one who had a disbelieving companion,  ﴾فَاطَّلَعَ فَرَءَاهُ فِى سَوَآءِ الْجَحِيمِ - قَالَ تَاللَّهِ إِن كِدتَّ لَتُرْدِينِ - وَلَوْلاَ نِعْمَةُ رَبِّى لَكُنتُ مِنَ الْمُحْضَرِينَ - أَفَمَا نَحْنُ بِمَيِّتِينَ - إِلاَّ مَوْتَتَنَا الاٍّولَى وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُعَذَّبِينَ ﴿ (So he looked down and saw him in the midst of the Fire. He said: \"By Allah! You have nearly ruined me. Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought forth (to Hell).\" (The dwellers of Paradise will say!) \"Are we then not to die (any more) Except our first death, and we shall not be punished\") 37:55-59. Allah will punish the disbeliever for the claims he used to utter in this life. The angels will also admonish the disbelievers, saying,  ﴾هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ - أَفَسِحْرٌ هَـذَا أَمْ أَنتُمْ لاَ تُبْصِرُونَ - اصْلَوْهَا فَاصْبِرُواْ أَوْ لاَ تَصْبِرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْكُمْ إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ ﴿ (This is the Fire which you used to belie. Is this magic or do you not see Taste you therein its heat and whether you are patient of it or impatient of it, it is all the same. You are only being requited for what you used to do) 52:14-16. The Messenger of Allah admonished the inhabitants of the well at Badr:  ﴾«يَا أَبَا جَهْلِ بْنَ هِشَامٍ وَيَا عُتْبَةَ بْنَ رَبِيعَةَ وَيَا شَيْبَةَ بْنَ رَبِيعَةَ وَسَمَّى رُؤُوسَهُمْ هَلْ وَجَدْتُمْ مَا وَعَدَ رَبُّكُمْ حَقًّا فَإِنِّي وَجَدْتُ مَا وَعَدَنِي رَبِّي حَقًّا»﴿ (O Abu Jahl bin Hisham! O `Utbah bin Rabi`ah! O Shaybah bin Rabi`ah (and he called their leaders by name)! Have you found what your Lord promised to be true (the Fire) I certainly found what my Lord has promised me to be true (victory).) `Umar said, \"O Allah's Messenger! Do you address a people who have become rotten carrion\" He said,  ﴾«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ مَا أَنْتُمْ بِأَسْمَعَ لِمَا أَقُولُ مِنْهُمْ وَلَكِنْ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ أَنْ يُجِيبُوا»﴿ (By He in Whose Hand is my soul! You do not hear what I am saying better than they do, but they cannot reply.) Allah's statement,  ﴾فَأَذَّنَ مُؤَذِّنٌ بَيْنَهُمْ﴿ (Then a crier will proclaim between them) will herald and announce,  ﴾أَن لَّعْنَةُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الظَّـلِمِينَ﴿ (The curse of Allah is on the wrongdoers) meaning, the curse will reside with the wrongdoers. Allah then described them by saying,  ﴾الَّذِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا﴿ (Those who hindered (men) from the path of Allah, and would seek to make it crooked) meaning, they hindered the people from following Allah's path, His Law, and what the Prophets brought. They sought to make Allah's path appear crooked and winding, so that no one would follow it. Allah said,  ﴾وَهُم بِالاٌّخِرَةِ كَـفِرُونَ﴿ (and they were disbelievers in the Hereafter) They disbelieved in the Meeting with Allah in the Hereafter, They used to deny this will ever occur, not accepting it nor believing in it. This is why they used to discount the seriousness of the evil deeds and statements that they committed, because they did not fear any reckoning or punishment. Therefore, they were and are indeed the worst people in statement and action.  "

  7,47,"<h2>The People of Al-A`raf</h2> After Allah mentioned that the people of Paradise will address the people of the Fire, He stated that there is a barrier between Paradise and the Fire, which prevents the people of the Fire from reaching Paradise. Ibn Jarir said, \"It is the wall that Allah described,  ﴾فَضُرِبَ بَيْنَهُم بِسُورٍ لَّهُ بَابٌ بَاطِنُهُ فِيهِ الرَّحْمَةُ وَظَـهِرُهُ مِن قِبَلِهِ الْعَذَابُ﴿ (So a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein. Inside it will be mercy, and outside it will be torment.) 57:13 It is also about Al-A`raf that Allah said,  ﴾وَعَلَى الاٌّعْرَافِ رِجَالٌ﴿ (and on Al-A`raf will be men).\" Ibn Jarir recorded that As-Suddi said about Allah's statement,  ﴾وَبَيْنَهُمَا حِجَابٌ﴿ (And between them will be a screen) \"It is the wall, it is Al-A`raf.\" Mujahid said, \"Al-A`raf is a barrier between Paradise and the Fire, a wall that has a gate.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"Al-A`raf is plural for `Urf, where every elevated piece of land is known as `Urf to the Arabs.\" As-Suddi said, \"Al-A`raf is so named because its residents recognize (Ya`rifun) the people. Al-A`raf's residents are those whose good and bad deeds are equal, as Hudhayfah, Ibn `Abbas, Ibn Mas`ud and several of the Salaf and later generations said.\" Ibn Jarir recorded that Hudhayfah was asked about the people of Al-A`raf and he said, \"A people whose good and bad deeds are equal. Their evil deeds prevented them from qualifying to enter Paradise, and their good deeds qualified them to avoid the Fire. Therefore, they are stopped there on the wall until Allah judges them.\" Ma`mar said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,  ﴾لَمْ يَدْخُلُوهَا وَهُمْ يَطْمَعُونَ﴿ (and at that time they will not yet have entered it (Paradise), but they will hope to enter (it).) Then he said, \"By Allah! Allah did not put this hope in their hearts, except for an honor that He intends to bestow on them.\" Qatadah said; \"Those who hope are those among you whom Allah informed of their places.\" Allah said next,  ﴾وَإِذَا صُرِفَتْ أَبْصَـرُهُمْ تِلْقَآءَ أَصْحَـبِ النَّارِ قَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لاَ تَجْعَلْنَا مَعَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّـلِمِينَ ﴿ (And when their eyes will be turned towards the dwellers of the Fire, they will say: \"Our Lord! Place us not with the people who are wrongdoers.\") Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When the people of Al-A`raf look at the people of the Fire and recognize them, they will supplicate, `O Lord! Do not place us with the people who are wrongdoers.\"'  ﴾وَنَادَى أَصْحَـبُ الاٌّعْرَافِ رِجَالاً يَعْرِفُونَهُمْ بِسِيمَـهُمْ قَالُواْ مَآ أَغْنَى عَنكُمْ جَمْعُكُمْ وَمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ ﴿"
  7,48,"1003"
  7,49,"﴾مَآ أَغْنَى عَنكُمْ جَمْعُكُمْ﴿ (\"Of what benefit to you was your gathering...\") meaning, your great numbers,  ﴾وَمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ﴿ (\"...and your arrogance\") This Ayah means, your great numbers and wealth did not save you from Allah's torment. Rather, you are dwelling in His torment and punishment. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas,  ﴾أَهَـؤُلاءِ الَّذِينَ أَقْسَمْتُمْ لاَ يَنَالُهُمُ اللَّهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ﴿ (Are they those, of whom you swore that Allah would never show them mercy) refers to the people of Al-A`raf who will be told when Allah decrees:  ﴾ادْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمْ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ﴿ ((Behold! It has been said to them): \"Enter Paradise, no fear shall be on you, nor shall you grieve.\")  "

  7,51,"<h2>The Favors of paradise are Prohibited for the People of the Fire</h2> Allah emphasizes the disgrace of the people of the Fire. They will ask the people of Paradise for some of their drink and food, but they will not be given any of that. As-Suddi said,  ﴾وَنَادَى أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ أَصْحَـبَ الْجَنَّةِ أَنْ أَفِيضُواْ عَلَيْنَا مِنَ الْمَآءِ أَوْ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ اللَّهُ﴿ (And the dwellers of the Fire will call to the dwellers of Paradise: \"Pour on us some water or anything that Allah has provided you with.\") \"That is food\". Ath-Thawri said that `Uthman Ath-Thaqafi said that Sa`id bin Jubayr commented on this Ayah, \"One of them will call his father or brother, `I have been burned, so pour some water on me.' The believers will be asked to reply, and they will reply,  ﴾إِنَّ اللَّهَ حَرَّمَهُمَا عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ﴿ (\"Both Allah has forbidden to the disbelievers.\")\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that,  ﴾إِنَّ اللَّهَ حَرَّمَهُمَا عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ﴿ (\"Both Allah has forbidden to the disbelievers.\") \"Refers to the food and drink of Paradise.\" Allah describes the disbelievers by what they used to do in this life, taking the religion as amusement and play, and being deceived by this life and its adornment, rather than working for the Hereafter as Allah commanded,  ﴾فَالْيَوْمَ نَنسَـهُمْ كَمَا نَسُواْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِهِمْ هَـذَا﴿ (So this Day We shall forget them as they forgot their meeting of this Day) meaning, Allah will treat them as if He has forgotten them. Certainly, nothing escapes Allah's perfect watch and He never forgets anything. Allah said in another Ayah,  ﴾فِى كِتَـبٍ لاَّ يَضِلُّ رَبِّى وَلاَ يَنسَى﴿ (In a Record. My Lord neither errs nor forgets) 20:52 Allah said -- that He will forget them on that Day -- as just recompense for them, because,  ﴾نَسُواْ اللَّهَ فَنَسِيَهُمْ﴿ (They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them) 9:67  ﴾كَذَلِكَ أَتَتْكَ آيَـتُنَا فَنَسِيتَهَا وَكَذلِكَ الْيَوْمَ تُنْسَى﴿ (Like this: Our Ayat came unto you, but you disregarded them, and so this Day, you will be neglected) 20:126 and,  ﴾وَقِيلَ الْيَوْمَ نَنسَاكُمْ كَمَا نَسِيتُمْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِكُمْ هَـذَا﴿ (And it will be said: \"This Day We will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours.\") 45:34 Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on,  ﴾فَالْيَوْمَ نَنسَـهُمْ كَمَا نَسُواْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِهِمْ هَـذَا﴿ (So this Day We shall forget them as they forgot their meeting of this Day) \"Allah will forget the good about them, but not their evil.\" And `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"We shall forsake them as they have forsaken the meeting of this Day of theirs.\" Mujahid said, \"We shall leave them in the Fire.\" As-Suddi said, \"We shall leave them from any mercy, just as they left any action on behalf of the meeting on this Day of theirs.\" It is recorded in the Sahih that Allah will say to the servant on the Day of Resurrection:  ﴾«أَلَمْ أُزَوِّجْكَ؟ أَلَمْ أُكْرِمْكَ؟ أَلَمْ أُسَخِّرْ لَكَ الْخَيْلَ وَالْإِبِلَ وَأَذَرْكَ تَرْأَسُ وَتَرْبَعُ؟ فَيَقُولُ: بَلَى، فَيَقُولُ: أَظَنَنْتَ أَنَّكَ مُلَاقِيَّ؟ فَيَقُولُ: لَا، فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: فَالْيَوْمَ أَنْسَاكَ كَمَا نَسِيتَنِي»﴿ (\"Have I not gotten you married Have I not honored you Have I not made horses and camels subservient for you and allowed you to become a leader and a master\" He will say, \"Yes.\" Allah will say, \"Did you think that you will meet Me\" He will say, \"No.\" Allah the Exalted will say, `Then this Day, I will forget you as you have forgotten Me.\")  "
