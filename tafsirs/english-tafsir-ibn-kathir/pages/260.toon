tafsir[9]{c,v,t}:
  14,34,"<h2>Describing Some of Allah's Tremendous Favors</h2> Allah mentions some of the favors He has done for His creatures, such as creating the heavens as a protective ceiling and the earth as a bed. He also sends down rain from the sky and, in its aftermath brings forth a variety of vegetation, fruits and plants of different colors, shapes, tastes, scents and uses. Allah also made the ships sail on the surface of the water by His command and He made the sea able to carry these ships in order that travelers can transfer from one area to another to transport goods. Allah also created the rivers that flow through the earth from one area to another as provision for the servants which they use to drink and irrigate, and for other benefits,  وَسَخَّر لَكُمُ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ دَآئِبَينَ  (And He has made the sun and the moon, both constantly pursuing their courses), rotating by night and by day,  لاَ الشَّمْسُ يَنبَغِى لَهَآ أَن تدْرِكَ القَمَرَ وَلاَ الَّيْلُ سَابِقُ النَّهَارِ وَكُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ  (It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor does the night outstrip the day. They all float, each in an orbit.)36:40 and,  يُغْشِى الَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ أَلاَ لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالاٌّمْرُ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ  (He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His command. His is the creation and commandment. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of all that exists!) 7:54 The sun and the moon rotate in succession, and the night and the day are opposites, each taking from the length of the other or giving up some of its length,  يُولِجُ الَّيْلَ فِى النَّهَارِ وَيُولِجُ النَّهَارَ فِى الَّيْلِ  ((Allah ) merges the night into day, and merges the day into night.) 35:13 and,  وَسَخَّـرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ كُـلٌّ يَجْرِى لاًّجَـلٍ مُّسَـمًّى أَلا هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْغَفَّارُ  (And He has subjected the sun and the moon. Each running (on a fixed course) for an appointed term. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Oft-Forgiving.) 39:5 Allah said next,  وَآتَاكُم مِّن كُلِّ مَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُ  (And He gave you of all that you asked for), He has prepared for you all that you need in all conditions, and what you ask Him to provide for you,  وَإِن تَعُدُّواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ لاَ تُحْصُوهَا  (and if you try to count the blessings of Allah, never will you be able to count them.) Allah states that the servants are never able to count His blessings, let alone thank Him duly for them. In Sahih Al-Bukhari it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to supplicate;  «اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ غَيْرَ مَكْفِيَ وَلَا مُوَدَّعٍ وَلَا مُسْتَغْنًى عَنْهُ رَبَّنَا»  (O Allah ! All praise is due to You, without being able to sufficiently thank You, nor ever wish to be cutoff from You, nor ever feeling rich from relying on You; our Lord!) It was reported that Prophet Dawud, peace be upon him, used to say in his supplication, \"O Lord! How can I ever duly thank You, when my thanking You is also a favor from You to me\" Allah the Exalted answered him, \"Now, you have thanked Me sufficiently, O Dawud,\" meaning, `when you admitted that you will never be able to duly thank Me.'

  14,36,"<h2>brahim's Supplication to Allah when He brought Isma`il to Makkah</h2> Allah mentions here, while bringing forth more evidences against Arab polytheists, that the Sacred House in Makkah was established on the worship of Allah alone, without partners. He also states that Ibrahim, who establsihed the city, has disowned those who worship others besides Allah, and that he begged Allah to make Makkah peaceful and secure,  رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِنًا  (O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) of peace and security,) and Allah accepted his supplication. Allah said in other Ayat,  أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا حَرَماً ءامِناً  (Have they not seen that We have made (Makkah) a secure sanctuary.) 29:67 and,  إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَيْتٍ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَلَّذِى بِبَكَّةَ مُبَارَكاً وَهُدًى لِّلْعَـلَمِينَ فِيهِ ءَايَـتٌ بَيِّـنَـتٌ مَّقَامُ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ ءَامِناً  (Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for Al-'Alamin. In it are manifest signs, the Maqam of Ibrahim; whosoever enters it, he attains security.)3:96 Allah said here that Ibrahim supplicated,  رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِنًا  (O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) a of peace and security, ) saying, \"this city\", after he established it, and this is why he said afterwards,  الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ الَّذِى وَهَبَ لِى عَلَى الْكِبَرِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـقَ  (All praise is due to Allah, Who has given me in old age Isma`il and Ishaq.) 14:39 It is well-known that Isma`il was thirteen years older than Ishaq. When Ibrahim took Isma`il and his mother to Makkah, while Isma`il was still young enough to nurse, he supplicated to Allah,  رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا بَلَدًا آمِنًا  (O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) a place of peace and security.) 2:126 as we in explained in Surat Al-Baqarah. Ibrahim then said,  وَاجْنُبْنِى وَبَنِىَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ الاٌّصْنَامَ  (and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.) It is proper for whoever supplicates to Allah to also ask for the benefit of his parents and offspring, as well as himself. Ibrahim next mentioned that many among mankind were led astray because of idols, and he disowned those who worship them and referred their matter to Allah; if Allah wills, He will punish them, and if He wills, He will forgive them. `Isa, peace be upon him, said similar words,  إِن تُعَذِّبْهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ عِبَادُكَ وَإِن تَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ فَإِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ  (If You punish them, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, verily, You, only You are the Almighty, the All-Wise.)5:118 This supplication refers this and all matters to Allah, not that it is actually going to happen. `Abdullah bin `Amr narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited Ibrahim's supplication,  رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ النَّاسِ  (O my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind.), and the supplication of `Isa,  إِن تُعَذِّبْهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ عِبَادُكَ  (If You punish them, they are Your servants.) 5:118 then raised his hands and said,  «اللَّهُمَّ أُمَّتِي، اللَّهُمَّ أُمَّتِي، اللَّهُمَّ أُمَّتِي»  (O Allah, Save my Ummah! O, Allah, Save my Ummah! O, Allah, Save my Ummah!) and cried. Allah said to the angel Jibril, \"O Jibril, go to Muhammad ﷺ, and Your Lord has more knowledge, and ask him what makes him cry.\" Jibril came to the Prophet and asked him, and he repeated to him what he said (in his supplication). Allah said, \"Go to Muhammad ﷺ and tell him this; `We will make you pleased with your Ummah, O Muhammad, and will not treat them in a way you dislike.\"' "
  14,37,"﴾عِندَ بَيْتِكَ الْمُحَرَّمِ﴿ (by Your Sacred House...) then he, ﴾رَبَّنَا لِيُقِيمُواْ الصَّلوةَ﴿ (O our Lord, that they may perform Salah.) Ibn Jarir At-Tabari commented that this, \"Refers to his earlier statement, ﴾الْمُحَرَّمِ﴿ (the Sacred...),\" meaning, `You have made this House Sacred so that people establish the prayer next to it,' ﴾فَاجْعَلْ أَفْئِدَةً مَّنَ النَّاسِ تَهْوِى إِلَيْهِمْ﴿ (So fill some hearts among men with love towards them,) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Sa'id bin Jubayr said, \"Had Ibrahim said, `The hearts of mankind', Persians, Romans, the Jews, the Christians and all other people would have gathered around it.\" However, Ibrahim said, ﴾مِنَ النَّاسِ﴿ (among men), thus making it exclusive to Muslims only. He said next, ﴾وَارْزُقْهُمْ مِّنَ الثَّمَرَتِ﴿ (and (O Allah) provide them with fruits) in order that they may be helped in obeying You, and because this is a barren valley; bring to them fruits that they might eat. Allah accepted Ibrahim's supplication, ﴾أَوَلَمْ نُمَكِّن لَّهُمْ حَرَماً ءَامِناً يُجْبَى إِلَيْهِ ثَمَرَاتُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ رِّزْقاً مِّن لَّدُنَّا﴿ (Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary (Makkah), to which are brought fruits of all kinds, a provision from Ourselves.) 28:57 This only indicates Allah's compassion, kindness, mercy and blessing, in that there are no fruit producing trees in the Sacred City, Makkah, yet all kinds of fruits are being brought to it from all around; this is how Allah accepted the supplication of the Khalil - Allah's intimate friend, Prophet Ibrahim, peace be upon him.

  14,41,"﴾رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ تَعْلَمُ مَا نُخْفِى وَمَا نُعْلِنُ﴿ (O our Lord! Certainly, You know what we conceal and what we reveal.) meaning, `You know the intention behind my supplication for the people of this town, seeking Your pleasure in sincerity to You. You know all things, apparent and hidden, and nothing escapes Your knowledge on the earth or in heaven.\"' He next praised and thanked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored for granting him offspring after he became old, ﴾الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ الَّذِى وَهَبَ لِى عَلَى الْكِبَرِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـقَ إِنَّ رَبِّى لَسَمِيعُ الدُّعَآءِ ﴿ (All praise is due to Allah, Who has given me in old age Isma'il (Ishmael) and Ishaq (Isaac). Verily, my Lord is indeed the All-Hearer of invocations.) `He accepts the supplication of those who invoke Him, and has accepted my invocation when I asked Him to grant me offspring. ' Ibrahim said next, ﴾رَبِّ اجْعَلْنِى مُقِيمَ الصَّلوةِ﴿ (O my Lord! Make me one who performs Salah,), preserving its obligations and limits, ﴾وَمِن ذُرِّيَتِى﴿ (and (also) from my offspring,), make them among those who establish the prayer, as well, ﴾رَبَّنَا وَتَقَبَّلْ دُعَآءِ﴿ (our Lord! And accept my invocation.), all of my invocation which I invoked You with herein, ﴾رَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لِى وَلِوَالِدَىَّ﴿ (Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents,) Ibrahim said this before he declared himself innocent from his father, after he became sure that he was an enemy of Allah, ﴾وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ﴿ (and the believers), all of them, ﴾يَوْمَ يَقُومُ الْحِسَابُ﴿ (on the Day when the reckoning will be established.) on the Day when You will reckon Your servants and recompense or reward them for their deeds - good for good and evil for evil.
