  42,46,"<h2>The State of the Wrongdoers on the Day of Resurrection</h2> Allah tells us that whatever He wills happens and whatever He does not will does not happen, and no one can make it happen. Whomever He guides, none can lead astray, and whomever He leads astray, none can guide, as He says: ﴾وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ وَلِيًّا مُّرْشِدًا﴿ (but he whom He sends astray, for him you will find no protecting to lead him.) (18:17). Then Allah tells us about the wrongdoers, i.e., the idolators who associate others in worship with Allah: ﴾لَمَّا رَأَوُاْ اْلَعَذَابَ﴿ (when they behold the torment,) i.e., on the Day of Resurrection, they will wish that they could go back to this world. ﴾يَقُولُونَ هَلْ إِلَى مَرَدٍّ مِّن سَبِيلٍ﴿ (they will say: \"Is there any way of return\") This is like the Ayah: ﴾وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُواْ يلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلاَ نُكَذِّبَ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ - بَلْ بَدَا لَهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يُخْفُونَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَوْ رُدُّواْ لَعَـدُواْ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ ﴿ (If you could but see when they will be held over the (Hell) Fire! They will say: \"Would that we were but sent back! Then we would not deny the Ayat of our Lord, and we would be of the believers!\" Nay, it has become manifest to them what they had been concealing before. But if they were returned, they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars.) (6:27-28) ﴾وَتَرَاهُمْ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَيْهَا﴿ (And you will see them brought forward to it) means, to the Fire. ﴾خَـشِعِينَ مِنَ الذُّلِّ﴿ (made humble by disgrace,) means, in a befitting manner, because of their previous disobedience towards Allah. ﴾يَنظُرُونَ مِن طَرْفٍ خَفِىٍّ﴿ ((and) looking with stealthy glance.) Mujahid said, \"In a humiliated manner.\" That is, they will steal glances at it, because they will be afraid of it. But the thing that they are afraid of will undoubtedly happen, and worse than that -- may Allah save us from that. ﴾وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ﴿ (And those who believe will say) means, on the Day of Resurrection they will say: ﴾إِنَّ الْخَـسِرِينَ﴿ (Verily, the losers...) means, the greatest losers. ﴾الَّذِينَ خَسِرُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ﴿ (are they who lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. ) means, they will be taken to the Fire and deprived of any pleasures in the Hereafter. They will lose themselves, and they will be separated from their loved ones, companions, families and relatives, and they will lose them. ﴾أَلاَ إِنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَ فِى عَذَابٍ مُّقِيمٍ﴿ (Verily, the wrongdoers will be in a lasting torment.) means, everlasting and eternal, with no way out and no escape. ﴾وَمَا كَانَ لَهُم مِّنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ يَنصُرُونَهُم مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ﴿ (And they will have no protectors to help them other than Allah.) means, no one to save them from the punishment and torment which they are suffering. ﴾وَمَن يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِن سَبِيلٍ﴿ (And he whom Allah sends astray, for him there is no way.) means, no salvation.

  42,48,"<h2>Encouragement to obey Allah before the Day of Resurrection</h2> When Allah tells us about the horrors and terrifying events of the Day of Resurrection, He warns us about it and commands us to prepare for it:  اسْتَجِيبُواْ لِرَبِّكُمْ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِىَ يَوْمٌ لاَّ مَرَدَّ لَهُ مِنَ اللَّهِ  (Answer the Call of your Lord before there comes from Allah a Day which cannot be averted.) means, once He issues the command, it will come to pass within the blinking of an eye, and no one will be able to avert it or prevent it.  مَا لَكُمْ مِّن مَّلْجَأٍ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّكِيرٍ  (You will have no refuge on that Day nor there will be for you any denying.) means, you will have no stronghold in which to take refuge, no place in which to hide from Allah, for He will encompass you with His knowledge and power, and you will have no refuge from Him except with Him.  يَقُولُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ - كَلاَّ لاَ وَزَرَ - إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ  (On that Day man will say: \"Where (is the refuge) to flee\" No! There is no refuge! Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) (75:10-12)  فَإِنْ أَعْرَضُواْ  (But if they turn away,) refers to the idolators,  فَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَـكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظاً  (We have not sent you as a Hafiz over them. ) means, `you have no power over them.' And Allah says elsewhere:  لَّيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَاهُمْ وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ  (Not upon you is their guidance, but Allah guides whom He wills) (2:272).  فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَـغُ وَعَلَيْنَا الْحِسَابُ  (your duty is only to convey (the Message) and on Us is the reckoning) (13:40). And Allah says here:  إِنْ عَلَيْكَ إِلاَّ الْبَلَـغُ  (Your duty is to convey.) meaning, `all that We require you to do is to convey the Message of Allah to them.'  وَإِنَّآ إِذَآ أَذَقْنَا الإِنسَـنَ مِنَّا رَحْمَةً فَرِحَ بِهَا  (And verily, when We cause man to taste of mercy from Us, he rejoices there at;) means, when a time of ease and comfort comes to him, he is happy about it.  وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ  (but when befalls them) means mankind.  سَيِّئَةٌ  (some evil) means, drought, punishment, tribulation or difficulty,  فَإِنَّ الإِنسَـنَ كَفُورٌ  (then verily, man (becomes) ingrate!) means, he forgets the previous times of ease and blessings and acknowledges nothing but the present moment. If times of ease come to him, he becomes arrogant and transgresses, but if any difficulty befalls him, he loses hope and is filled with despair. This is like what the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to the women:  «يَا مَعْشَرَ النِّسَاءِ، تَصَدَّقْنَ، فَإِنِّي رَأَيْتُكُنَّ أَكْثَرَ أَهْلِ النَّار»  )(O women, give in charity, for I have seen that you form the majority of the people of Hell.) A woman asked, \"Why is that, O Messenger of Allah\" He said:  «لِأَنَّكُنَّ تُكْثِرْنَ الشِّكَايَةَ وَتَكْفُرْنَ الْعَشِيرَ، لَوْ أَحْسَنْتَ إِلى إِحْدَاهُنَّ الدَّهْرَ ثُمَّ تَرَكْتَ يَوْمًا، قَالَتْ: مَا رَأَيْتُ مِنْكَ خَيْرًا قَط»  (Because you complain too much, and you are ungrateful to (your) husbands. If one of you were to be treated kindly for an entire lifetime, then that kindness was lacking for one day, she would say, `I have never seen anything good from you!') This is the case with most women, except for those whom Allah guides and who are among the people who believe and do righteous deeds. As the Prophet said, the believer is the one who:  «إِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ سَرَّاءُ شَكَرَ، فَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ، وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ ضَرَّاءُ صَبَرَ، فَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ، وَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ لِأَحَدٍ إِلَّا لِلْمُؤْمِن»  (... if something good happens to him, he is thankful, and that is good for him. If something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him. This does not happen to anyone except the believer.) "

  42,50,"<h2>Allah tells us that He is the Creator, Sovereign and Controller of the heavens and the earth.</h2> Whatever he wills happens, and whatever He does not will does not happen. He gives to whomsoever He wills and withholds from whomsoever he wills; none can withhold what He gives, and none can give what He withholds, and He creates whatever He wills. ﴾يَهَبُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ إِنَـثاً﴿ (He bestows female upon whom He wills.) means, He gives them daughters only. Al-Baghawi said, \"And among them (those who were given daughters only) was Lut, peace be upon him.\" ﴾وَيَهَبُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ الذُّكُورَ﴿ (and bestows male upon whom He wills.) means, He gives them sons only. Al-Baghawi said, \"Like Ibrahim Al-Khalil, peace be upon him, who did not have any daughters.\" ﴾أَوْ يُزَوِّجُهُمْ ذُكْرَاناً وَإِنَـثاً﴿ (Or He bestows both males and females,) means, He gives to whomsoever He wills both males and females, sons and daughters. Al-Baghawi said, \"Like Muhammad .\" ﴾وَيَجْعَلُ مَن يَشَآءُ عَقِيماً﴿ (and He renders barren whom He wills. ) means, so that he has no children at all. Al-Baghawi said, \"Like Yahya and `Isa, peace be upon them.\" So people are divided into four categories: some are given daughters, some are given sons, some are given both sons and daughters, and some are not given either sons or daughters, but they are rendered barren, with no offspring. ﴾إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ﴿ (Verily, He is the All-Knower) means, He knows who deserves to be in which of these categories. ﴾قَدِيرٌ﴿ (and is Able (to do all things).) means, to do whatever He wills and to differentiate between people in this manner. This issue is similar to that referred to in the Ayah where Allah says of `Isa, peace be upon him: ﴾وَلِنَجْعَلَهُ ءَايَةً لِّلْنَّاسِ﴿ (And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind) (19:21): i.e., proof for them of His power, for He created people in four different ways. Adam, peace be upon him, was created from clay, from neither a male nor a female. Hawwa', peace be upon her, was created from a male without a female. All other people, besides `Isa, peace be upon him, were created from male and female, and this sign of Allah was completed with the creation of `Isa bin Maryam, may peace be upon them both, who was created from a female without a male. Allah says: ﴾وَلِنَجْعَلَهُ ءَايَةً لِّلْنَّاسِ﴿ (And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind) (19: 21). This issue has to do with parents, whilst the previous issue has to do with children, and in each case there are four categories. Glory be to the All-Knower Who is Able to do all things. "
