tafsir[10]{c,v,t}:
  45,23,"<h2>The Life and the Death of the Believers and the Disbelievers are not Equal</h2> Allah the Exalted states here that the believers and the disbelievers are never equal. Allah said in another Ayah, ﴾لاَ يَسْتَوِى أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ وَأَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ هُمُ الْفَآئِزُونَ ﴿ (Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise. It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be successful.) (59:20) Allah said here, ﴾أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُواْ السَّيِّئَـتِ﴿ (Or do those who earn evil deeds think) those who commit and practice evil, ﴾أَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ سَوَآءً مَّحْيَـهُمْ وَمَمَـتُهُمْ﴿ (that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous good deeds, in their life and their death) treat them equally in the present life of the world and in the Hereafter ﴾سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ﴿ (Worst is the judgement that they make.) `worst is the thought that they have about Us and about Our justice, thinking that We will ever make the pious and the wicked equal in the Hereafter or this life.' At--Tabarani recorded that Shu`bah said that `Amr bin Murrah narrated that Abu Ad-Duha said that Masruq said that Tamim Ad-Dari once stood in voluntary prayer through the night until the morning only reciting this Ayah, ﴾أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُواْ السَّيِّئَـتِ أَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ﴿ (Or do those who earn evil deeds think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous good deeds) Allah said in reply: ﴾سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ﴿ (Worst is the judgement that they make.) Allah said, ﴾وَخَلَقَ اللَّهُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ بِالْحَقِّ﴿ (And Allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth,) meaning, in justice, ﴾وَلِتُجْزَى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ﴿ (in order that each person may be recompensed what he has earned, and they will not be wronged.) Allah the Exalted said, ﴾أَفَرَأَيْتَ مَنِ اتَّخَذَ إِلَـهَهُ هَوَاهُ﴿ (Have you seen him who takes his own lust as his god), who abides by his lust, and whatever his lust portrays as good he implements it, and whatever his lust portrays as evil, he abandons it! Allah's statement, ﴾وَأَضَلَّهُ اللَّهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ﴿ (And Allah left him astray with knowledge, ) has two meanings. One of them is that Allah knew that this person deserves to be misguided, so He left him astray. The second meaning is that Allah led this person astray after knowledge reached him and the proof was established before him. The second meaning includes the first meaning, but not the opposite. Allah said, ﴾وَخَتَمَ عَلَى سَمْعِهِ وَقَلْبِهِ وَجَعَلَ عَلَى بَصَرِهِ غِشَـوَةً﴿ (and sealed his hearing and his heart, and put a cover on his sight.) so he does not hear what benefits him, understands not what would lead him to the guidance and sees not the evidence with which he can be enlightened. This is why Allah said, ﴾فَمَن يَهْدِيهِ مِن بَعْدِ اللَّهِ أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ﴿ (Who then will guide him after Allah Will you not then remember) Allah said in a similar Ayah, ﴾مَن يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَلاَ هَادِيَ لَهُ وَيَذَرُهُمْ فِى طُغْيَـنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ ﴿ (Whomsoever Allah sends astray, none can guide him; and He lets them wander blindly in their transgressions.) (7:186). "

  45,26,"<h2>The Conviction of the Disbelievers, Their Argument and the Refutation of it</h2> Allah mentions here the creed of Ad-Dahriyyah and the Arab idolators who embraced their creed, denying Resurrection,  وَقَالُواْ مَا هِىَ إِلاَّ حَيَاتُنَا الدُّنْيَا نَمُوتُ وَنَحْيَا  (And they say: \"There is nothing but our life of this world, we die and we live....\") They say that there is only this life, some people die while others are born to life, without Resurrection or Judgement. This was the creed of Arab idolators who used to deny Resurrection, in addition to, the creed of the atheist philosophers among them who denied the creation and Resurrection. This was also the statement of atheist philosophers who deny the Creator and think that the world will return to its original form once every thirty--six thousand years, when everything will restart its life--cycle again! They claim that this cycle was repeated for infinity, thus contradicting the sound reason and the divine revelation. They said,  وَمَا يُهْلِكُنَآ إِلاَّ الدَّهْرُ  (and nothing destroys us except Ad-Dahr (time).) Allah the Exalted said in reply,  وَمَا لَهُمْ بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَظُنُّونَ  (And they have no knowledge of it, they only presume.) they speculate and guess! As for the Hadith recorded by the two collectors of the Sahih, and Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i, from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «يَقُولُ تَعَالَى: يُؤْذِينِي ابْنُ آدَمَ، يَسُبُّ الدَّهْرَ وَأَنَا الدَّهْرُ، بِيَدِيَ الْأَمْرُ، أُقَلِّبُ لَيْلَهُ وَنَهَارَه»  (Allah the Exalted says, \"The Son of `Adam annoys Me when he curses Ad-Dahr (time), while I am Ad-Dahr. In My Hand are all matters; I cause the alternation of his days and nights.\") In another narration;  «لَا تَسُبُّوا الدَّهْرَ فَإِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى هُوَ الدَّهْر»  (Do not curse Ad-Dahr (time), for Allah is Ad-Dahr.) Ash-Shafi`i, Abu `Ubaydah and several other Imams of Tafsir explained the meaning of the Prophet's statement,  «لَا تَسُبُّوا الدَّهْرَ فَإِنَّ اللهَ هُوَ الدَّهْر»  (Do not abuse Ad-Dahr (time), for Allah is Ad-Dahr.) They said, \"During the time of Jahiliyyah, when an affliction, a calamity or a disaster struck them, the Arabs used to say, `Woe to Ad-Dahr (time)!' So they used to blame such incidents on Ad-Dahr, cursing Ad-Dahr in the process. Surely, it is Allah the Exalted and Most Honored Who causes these (and all) things to happen. This is why when they cursed Ad-Dahr, it was as if they were cursing Allah Himself, since truthfully, He causes all incidents to happen. Therefore, abusing Ad-Dahr was prohibited due to this consideration, for it was Allah Whom they meant by abusing Ad-Dahr, which -- as we said-- they accused of causing (distressful) incidents.\" This is the best explanation for this subject, and it is the desired meaning. Allah knows best. We should mention that Ibn Hazm and those of the Zahiriyyah like him made an error when they used this Hadith to include Ad-Dahr among Allah's most beautiful Names. Allah's statement,  وَإِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتُنَا بَيِّنَاتٍ  (And when Our Clear Ayat are recited to them,) means, when the truth is made plain to them and used as evidence against them, asserting that Allah is able to resurrect the bodies after they have perished and disintegrated,  مَّا كَانَ حُجَّتَهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ ائْتُواْ بِـَابَآئِنَآ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ  (their argument is no other than that they say: \"Bring back our fathers, if you are truthful!\") `bring them back to life, if what you say is true.' Allah the Exalted said,  قُلِ اللَّهُ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ  (Say (to them): \"Allah gives you life and then causes you to die...\") `for you are witnesses that He brings you (or new life) to existence after non--existence,'  كَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَكُنتُمْ أَمْوَتًا فَأَحْيَـكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ  (How can you disbelieve in Allah Seeing that you were dead and He gave you life. Then He will give you death, then again will bring you to life.) (2:28) Therefore, He Who is able to initiate creation, is able to restart it, as well and more obviously,  وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ  (And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him.) (30:27) Allah said next,  ثُمَّ يَجْمَعُكُمْ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ  (then He will assemble you on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt.) `when He resurrects you, it will be on and for the Day of Resurrection, not in this life. Therefore, your statement is groundless,'  ائْتُواْ بِـَابَآئِنَآ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ  Bring back our (dead) fathers, if you are truthful! Allah said,  يَوْمَ يَجْمَعُكُمْ لِيَوْمِ الْجَمْعِ  The Day when He will gather you (all) on the Day of Gathering. )64:9(,  لأَيِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ - لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ  (For what Day are these signs postponed For the Day of sorting out.) (77:12-13), and,  وَمَا نُؤَخِّرُهُ إِلاَّ لاًّجَلٍ مَّعْدُودٍ  (And We delay it only for a term (already) fixed.) (11:104) Allah said here,  ثُمَّ يَجْمَعُكُمْ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ  (then He will assemble you on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt.) there is no doubt that it will come,  وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ  (But most of mankind know not.) and this is why they deny Resurrection and discount the fact that the bodies will be brought back to life. Allah the Exalted said,  إِنَّهُمْ يَرَوْنَهُ بَعِيداً - وَنَرَاهُ قَرِيباً  (Verily, they see it afar off. But We see it (quite) near.) (70:6), they discount the possibility that Resurrection will ever come, while the believers believe that its occurrence is easy and imminent. "

  45,29,"<h2>Some of the Conditions of the Day of Resurrection and its Horrors</h2> Allah mentions that He is the King and Owner of the heavens and earth, and the Only Ruler over them in this life and the Hereafter. Allah's statement, ﴾وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ﴿ (And on the Day that the Hour will be established) on the Day of Resurrection, ﴾يَخْسَرُ الْمُبْطِلُونَ﴿ (the followers of falsehood shall lose.) those who disbelieve in Allah and reject the clear proofs and unequivocal evidences that He has sent down to His Messengers. Allah said, ﴾وَتَرَى كُلَّ أُمَّةٍ جَاثِيَةً﴿ (And you will see each nation humbled to their knees (Jathiyah),) kneeling, fearful of the tremendous calamity and events. It was said that this will occur when Hellfire will be brought forth, for she will exhale once, and everyone will fall to their knees, including Ibrahim, the Khalil. He will proclaim, \"Myself, myself, myself! Today, I will not ask You (O Allah) but about myself.\" And even `Isa, will proclaim, \"Today, I will only argue before You on my own behalf, I will not ask You about Maryam, who gave birth to me.\" Allah said next, ﴾كُلُّ أمَّةٍ تُدْعَى إِلَى كِتَـبِهَا﴿ (each nation will be called to its Record. ) meaning, Record of deeds. Allah said in a similar Ayah, ﴾وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ﴿ (And the Book will be presented; and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward) (39:69). This is why Allah said here, ﴾الْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ﴿ (This Day you shall be recompensed for what you used to do.) `you will be judged according to your deeds, good and evil.' Allah said in similar Ayat; ﴾يُنَبَّأُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذِ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ - بَلِ الإِنسَـنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ - وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ﴿ (On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind. Nay! Man will be a witness against himself, though he may put forth his excuses.) (75:13-15) Allah said, ﴾هَـذَا كِتَـبُنَا يَنطِقُ عَلَيْكُم بِالْحَقِّ﴿ (This, Our Record speaks about you with truth.) It contains the record of all your actions, without addition or deletion. Allah also said: ﴾وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ فَتَرَى الْمُجْرِمِينَ مُشْفِقِينَ مِمَّا فِيهِ وَيَقُولُونَ يوَيْلَتَنَا مَا لِهَـذَا الْكِتَـبِ لاَ يُغَادِرُ صَغِيرَةً وَلاَ كَبِيرَةً إِلاَّ أَحْصَاهَا وَوَجَدُواْ مَا عَمِلُواْ حَاضِرًا وَلاَ يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا ﴿ (And the Book will be presented, and you will see the criminals, fearful of that which is therein. They will say:\"Woe to us! What sort of Book is this that leaves neither a small thing nor a big thing, but has recorded it with numbers!\" And they will find all that they did, placed before them, and your Lord treats no one with injustice.) (18:49) Allah's statement, ﴾إِنَّا كُنَّا نَسْتَنسِخُ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ﴿ (Verily, We were recording what you used to do.) means, `We ordered Our scribe angels to record your deeds.' Ibn `Abbas and others commented, \"The angels record the deeds of the servants and then ascend to heaven with them. There, they meet the angels entrusted with the Records of deeds sent down from Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz on each Night of Al-Qadr, containing what Allah has written will occur from the servants, long before He created them. They will compare their records and find out that not a single letter was added or deleted.\" He then recited this Ayah, ﴾إِنَّا كُنَّا نَسْتَنسِخُ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ﴿ (Verily, We were recording what you used to do.)
