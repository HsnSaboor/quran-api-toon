  28,88,"<h2>The Command to convey the Message of Tawhid</h2> Here Allah commands His Messenger to convey the Message and recite the Qur'an to people. He tells him that he will be brought back to the return, which is the Day of Resurrection, where he will be asked about the prophethood he was entrusted with. So Allah says:  إِنَّ الَّذِى فَرَضَ عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لَرَآدُّكَ إِلَى مَعَادٍ  (Verily, He Who has given you the Qur'an, will surely bring you back to the return.) meaning, `the One Who has commanded you to put it into practice among mankind,'  لَرَآدُّكَ إِلَى مَعَادٍ  (will surely bring you back to the return.) `On the Day of Resurrection, where He will question you concerning that,' as Allah said:  فَلَنَسْـَلَنَّ الَّذِينَ أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْهِمْ وَلَنَسْـَلَنَّ الْمُرْسَلِينَ  (Then surely, We shall question those to whom it was sent and verily, We shall question the Messengers.) (7:6) Allah said:  يَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ فَيَقُولُ مَاذَآ أُجِبْتُمْ  (On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together and say to them: \"What was the response you received\") (5:109). And He said:  وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ  (and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward) (39: 69) In his Tafsir of his Sahih, Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah:  لَرَآدُّكَ إِلَى مَعَادٍ  (will surely bring you back to the return.) \"To Makkah.\" This was also recorded by An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir in his Sunan, and by Ibn Jarir. Al-`Awfi also reported from Ibn `Abbas that the phrase:  لَرَآدُّكَ إِلَى مَعَادٍ  (will surely bring you back to the return.) means, \"will surely bring you back to Makkah as He brought you out of it.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded that Mujahid commented on:  لَرَآدُّكَ إِلَى مَعَادٍ  (will surely bring you back to the return.) He said, \"Back to your place of birth in Makkah.\" Ibn `Abbas is also reported to have interpreted it variously referring to death, to the Day of Resurrection which will come after death, and to Paradise which will be his reward and his destiny for putting the Message of Allah into practice and conveying it to the humans and Jinns, and because he is the most perfect, most eloquent and most noble of all the creation of Allah. Allah's saying:  قُل رَّبِّى أَعْلَمُ مَن جَآءَ بِالْهُدَى وَمَنْ هُوَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ  (Say: \"My Lord is Aware of him who brings guidance, and of him who is in manifest error.\") means: \"Say, O Muhammad, to those among your people who oppose you and disbelieve you, among the idolators and those who follow them in their disbelief, `My Lord knows best which of us, you or I, is rightly guided, and you will come to know for which of us will be the (happy) end in the Hereafter, and for which of us will be a good end and victory in this world and in the Hereafter'.\" Then Allah reminds His Prophet the numerous blessings He granted to him and mankind by virtue of sending him to them:  وَمَا كُنتَ تَرْجُو أَن يُلْقَى إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبُ  (And you were not expecting that the Book would be sent down to you,) `Before the revelation was sent down to you, you did not expect that revelation would be sent down to you.'  وَلَـكِن رَّحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ  (but it is a mercy from your Lord.) means, `but revelation has been sent down to you from Allah as a mercy to you and to mankind because of you. Since Allah has granted you this great blessing,'  فَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ ظَهيراً  (So never be a supporter) i.e., a helper,  لِلْكَـفِرِينَ  (of the disbelievers.) rather, separate from them, `express your hostility towards them and oppose them. '  وَلاَ يَصُدُّنَّكَ عَنْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ بَعْدَ إِذْ أُنزِلَتْ إِلَيْكَ  (And let them not turn you away from the Ayat of Allah after they have been sent down to you.) meaning, `Do not let their opposition to you affect you or put people off from following your way; do not worry about that or pay any attention to it, for Allah will make your word supreme, will support your religion and will make the Message with which He has sent you prevail over all other religions.' So He says:  وَادْعُ إِلَى رَبِّكَ  (and invite to your Lord) to worship your Lord Alone, with no partners or associates,  وَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكَينَ  (and be not of idolators.)  وَلاَ تَدْعُ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهاً ءَاخَرَ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ  (And invoke not any other god along with Allah, there is no God but Him.) means, it is not appropriate to worship anything or anybody except Him, and divinity does not befit any except His glory.  كُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلاَّ وَجْهَهُ  (Everything will perish save His Face.) Here Allah is telling us that He is Eternal, Ever Lasting, Ever Living, Self-Sustaining, Who, although His creation dies, He will never die, as He says:  كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ - وَيَبْقَى وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلْـلِ وَالإِكْرَامِ  (Whatsoever is on it will perish. And the Face of your Lord full of majesty and honor will remain forever.) (55:26-27). Allah used the word \"Face\" to refer to Himself, as He says here:  كُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلاَّ وَجْهَهُ  (Everything will perish save His Face.) meaning, everything except Him. It was reported in the Sahih via Abu Salamah that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «أَصْدَقُ كَلِمَةٍ قَالَهَا الشَّاعِرُ لَبِيدُ أَلَا كُلُّ شَيْءٍ مَا خَلَا اللهَ بَاطِلُ »  (The truest word of a poet was the saying of Labid - indeed everything except Allah is false.)  لَهُ الْحُكْمُ  (His is the decision,) means, dominion and control, and there is none who can reverse His judgement or decision.  وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ  (and to Him you shall be returned.) means, on the Day when you will be brought back, and He will reward or punish you according to your deeds: if they are good, then you will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then you will be punished. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Qasas. To Allah be praise and blessings. "

  29,4,"<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2>﴾بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ﴿ In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <h2>The Believers are tested so that it may be known Who is Sincere and Who is Lying</h2> Allah says: ﴾الم﴿ Alif Lam Mim.   In the beginning of the Tafsir of Surah Al-Baqarah, we discussed the letters which appear at the beginning of some Surahs. ﴾أَحَسِبَ النَّاسُ أَن يُتْرَكُواْ أَن يَقُولُواْ ءَامَنَّا وَهُمْ لاَ يُفْتَنُونَ ﴿ (Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: \"We believe,\" and will not be tested.) This is a rebuke in the form of a question, meaning that Allah will inevitably test His believing servants according to their level of faith, as it recorded in the authentic Hadith: ﴾«أَشَدُّ النَّاسِ بَلَاءً الْأَنْبِيَاءُ، ثُمَّ الصَّالِحُونَ، ثُمَّ الْأَمْثَلُ فَالْأَمْثَلُ، يُبْتَلَى الرَّجُلُ عَلَى حَسَبِ دِينِهِ، فَإِنْ كَانَ فِي دِينِهِ صَلَابَةٌ زِيدَ لَهُ فِي الْبَلَاء»﴿ (The people most severly tested are the Prophets, then the righteous, then the next best and the next best. A man will be tested in accordance with the degree of his religious commitment; the stonger his religious commitment, the stronger his test.) This Ayah is like the Ayah, ﴾أَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَن تَدْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَعْلَمِ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ جَـهَدُواْ مِنكُمْ وَيَعْلَمَ الصَّـبِرِينَ ﴿ (Do you think that you will enter Paradise without Allah knowing those of you who fought (in His cause) and knowing those who are the patient) (3:142) There is a similar Ayah in Surat At-Tawbah. And Allah says: ﴾أَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَن تَدْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَأْتِكُم مَّثَلُ الَّذِينَ خَلَوْاْ مِن قَبْلِكُم مَّسَّتْهُمُ الْبَأْسَآءُ وَالضَّرَّآءُ وَزُلْزِلُواْ حَتَّى يَقُولَ الرَّسُولُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَهُ مَتَى نَصْرُ اللَّهِ أَلاَ إِنَّ نَصْرَ اللَّهِ قَرِيبٌ ﴿ (Or think you that you will enter Paradise without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you They were afflicted with severe poverty and ailments and were so shaken that even the Messenger and those who believed along with him said, \"When (will come) the help of Allah\" Yes! Certainly, the help of Allah is near!) (2:214) Allah says here: ﴾وَلَقَدْ فَتَنَّا الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُواْ وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ الْكَـذِبِينَ ﴿ (And We indeed tested those who were before them so that Allah will know those who are true, and will know those who are liars.) meaning, He will make know which are sincere in their claim to be believers from those who are lying. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, knows what has happened in the past and what is yet to come, and He knows how that which will not happen would have happened if it were to happen. All the Imams of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah are agreed on this. This is the view of Ibn `Abbas and others concerning phrases such as the Ayah, ﴾إِلاَّ لِنَعْلَمَ﴿ (only that We know) (2:143). Meaning, only to see -- because seeing has to do with what is there, but knowledge is broader than seeing, since it includes what is not present as well as what is. <h2>The Evildoers cannot escape from Allah Allah said:</h2>﴾أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ السَّيِّئَاتِ أَن يَسْبِقُونَا سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ ﴿ (Or think those who do evil deeds that they can outstrip Us Evil is that which they judge!) means, those who are not believers should not think that they will escape such trials and tests, for ahead of them lies a greater and more severe punishment. Allah says: ﴾أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ السَّيِّئَاتِ أَن يَسْبِقُونَا﴿ (Or think those who do evil deeds that they can outstrip Us) meaning, \"escape\" from Us. ﴾سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ﴿ (Evil is that which they judge!) what they think is evil.
