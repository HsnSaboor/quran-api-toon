  2,50,"<h2>The Children of Israel were saved from Pharaoh and His Army Who drowned</h2> Allah said to the Children of Israel, \"Remember My favor on you  وَإِذْ نَجَّيْنَـكُم مِّنْ ءَالِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ  (And (remember) when We delivered you from Fir`awn's (Pharaoh) people, who were afflicting you with a horrible torment,) meaning, `I - Allah - saved you from them and delivered you from their hands in the company of Musa, after they subjected you to horrible torture.' This favor came after the cursed Pharaoh had a dream in which he saw a fire emerge from Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), and then the fire entered the houses of the Coptics in Egypt, with the exception of the Children of Israel. Its purport was that his kingship would be toppled by a man among the Children of Israel. It was also said that some of Pharaoh's entourage said that the Children of Israel were expecting a man among them to arise who would establish a state for them. We will mention the Hadith on this subject when we explain Surat Ta Ha (20), Allah willing. After the dream, Pharaoh ordered that every newborn male among the Children of Israel be killed and that the girls be left alone. He also commanded that the Children of Israel be given tasks of hard labor and assigned the most humiliating jobs.  The torment here refers to killing the male infants. In Surat Ibrahim (14) this meaning is clearly mentioned,  يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ وَيُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَآءَكُمْ  (Who were afflicting you with horrible torment, and were slaughtering your sons and letting your women live.) (14:6).  We will explain this Ayah in the beginning of Surat Al-Qasas (28), Allah willing, and our reliance and trust are with Him.  The meaning of,  يَسُومُونَكُمْ  (who were afflicting you) is, \"They humiliated you,\" as Abu `Ubaydah stated. It was also said that it means, \"They used to exaggerate in tormenting you\" according to Al-Qurtubi. As for Allah saying,  يُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَآءَكُمْ  (killing your sons and sparing your women) that explains His statement,  يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ  (who were afflicting you with horrible torment) then it explains the meaning of the favor He gave them, as mentioned in His statement,  اذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتِيَ الَّتِى أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ  (Remember My favor which I bestowed upon you). As for what Allah said in Surat Ibrahim,  وَذَكِّرْهُمْ بِأَيَّامِ اللَّهِ  (And remind them of the annals of Allah) (14:5) meaning, the favors and blessing He granted them, He then said,  يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ وَيُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَآءَكُمْ  (Who were afflicting you with horrible torment, and were slaughtering your sons and letting your women live.) (14:6)  So Allah mentioned saving their children from being slaughtered in order to remind them of the many favors that He granted them.  We should state here that `Pharaoh' (Fir`awn) is a title that was given to every disbelieving king who ruled Egypt, whether from the `Amaliq (Canaanites) or otherwise, just as Caesar (Qaysar) is the title of the disbelieving kings who ruled Rome and Damascus. Also, Khosrau (Kisra) is the title of the kings who ruled Persia, while Tubb`a is the title of the kings of Yemen, and the kings of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) were called Negus (An-Najashi).  Allah said,  وَفِى ذَلِكُمْ بَلاَءٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ  (And therein was a mighty trial from your Lord.)  Ibn Jarir commented that this part of the Ayah means, \"Our saving your fathers from the torment that they suffered by the hand of Pharaoh, is a great blessing from your Lord.\" We should mention that in the blessing there a is test, the same as with hardship, for Allah said,  وَنَبْلُوكُم بِالشَّرِّ وَالْخَيْرِ فِتْنَةً  (And We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good) (21:35) and,  وَبَلَوْنَـهُمْ بِالْحَسَنَـتِ وَالسَّيِّئَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ  (And We tried them with good (blessings) and evil (calamities) in order that they might turn (to obey Allah.)) (7:168).  Allah's statement next,  وَإِذْ فَرَقْنَا بِكُمُ الْبَحْرَ فَأَنجَيْنَـكُمْ وَأَغْرَقْنَا ءَالَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَأَنتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ  (And (remember) when We separated the sea for you and saved you and drowned Fir`awn's (Pharaoh) people while you were watching) means, `After We saved you from Fir`awn and you escaped with Musa; Fir`awn went out in your pursuit and We parted the sea for you.' Allah mentioned this story in detail, as we will come to know, Allah willing. One of the shortest references to this story is Allah's statement,  فَأَنجَيْنَـكُمْ  (And saved you) meaning, \"We saved you from them, drowning them while you watched, bringing relief to your hearts and humiliation to your enemy.\" <h2>Fasting the Day of `Ashura</h2> It was reported that the day the Children of Israel were saved from Fir`awn was called the day of `Ashura'. Imam Ahmad reported that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came to Al-Madinah and found that the Jews were fasting the day of `Ashura'. He asked them, \"What is this day that you fast\" They said, \"This is a good day during which Allah saved the Children of Israel from their enemy, and Musa used to fast this day.\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «أَنَا أَحَقُّ بِمُوسَى مِنْكُم»  (I have more right to Musa than you have.)  So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ fasted that day and ordered that it be fasted. This Hadith was collected by Al-Bukhari, Muslim, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. "

  2,53,"<h2>The Children of Israel worshipped the Calf</h2> Allah then said, \"Remember My favor on you when I forgave you for worshipping the calf.\" This happened after Musa went to the meeting place with his Lord at the end of that period which was forty days. These forty days were mentioned in Surat Al-A`raf, when Allah said,  ﴾وَوَعَدْنَا مُوسَى ثَلَـثِينَ لَيْلَةً وَأَتْمَمْنَاهَا بِعَشْرٍ﴿ (And We appointed for Musa thirty nights and added (to the period) ten (more)) (7:142).   It was said that these days were during the month of Dhul-Qa`dah plus the first ten days in Dhul-Hijjah, after the Children of Israel were delivered from Fir`awn and they safely crossed the sea. Allah's statement,  ﴾وَإِذْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَـبَ﴿ (And (remember) when We gave Musa the Scripture) means, the Tawrah,  ﴾وَالْفُرْقَانِ﴿ (And the criterion) that is that which differentiates between truth and falsehood, guidance and deviation.  ﴾لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ﴿ (So that you may be guided aright), after escaping the sea, as another Ayah in Surat Al-A`raf clearly stated,  ﴾وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَـبَ مِن بَعْدِ مَآ أَهْلَكْنَا الْقُرُونَ الاٍّولَى بَصَآئِرَ لِلنَّاسِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ ﴿ (And indeed We gave Musa ـ after We had destroyed the generations of old ـ the Scripture (the Tawrah) as an enlightenment for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy, that they might remember (or receive admonition)) (28:43).  "
  2,54,"<h2>The Children of Israel kill each other in Repentance</h2> This was the repentance required from the Children of Israel for worshipping the calf. Commenting on Allah's statement;  ﴾وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَى لِقَوْمِهِ يَـقَوْمِ إِنَّكُمْ ظَلَمْتُمْ أَنفُسَكُمْ بِاتِّخَاذِكُمُ الْعِجْلَ﴿ (And (remember) when Musa said to his people: \"O my people! Verily, you have wronged yourselves by worshipping the calf...), Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"When their hearts thought of worshipping the calf,  ﴾وَلَمَّا سُقِطَ فَى أَيْدِيهِمْ وَرَأَوْاْ أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ ضَلُّواْ قَالُواْ لَئِن لَّمْ يَرْحَمْنَا رَبُّنَا وَيَغْفِرْ لَنَا﴿ (And when they regretted and saw that they had gone astray, they (repented and) said: \"If our Lord does not have mercy upon us and forgive us\") (7:149). This is when Musa said to them,  ﴾يَـقَوْمِ إِنَّكُمْ ظَلَمْتُمْ أَنفُسَكُمْ بِاتِّخَاذِكُمُ الْعِجْلَ﴿ (O my people! Verily, you have wronged yourselves by worshipping the calf...).\" Abu `Al-`Aliyah, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas commented on,  ﴾فَتُوبُواْ إِلَى بَارِئِكُمْ﴿ (So turn in repentance to your Bari') that it means, \"To your Creator.\" Allah's statement,  ﴾إِلَى بَارِئِكُمْ﴿ (to your Bari' (Creator)) alerts the Children of Israel to the enormity of their error and means, \"Repent to He Who created you after you associated others with Him in worship.\"   An-Nasa'i, Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim recorded Ibn `Abbas saying, \"Allah told the Children of Israel that their repentance would be to slay by the sword every person they meet, be he father or son. They should not care whom they kill. Those were guilty whom Musa and Harun were not aware of their guilt, they admitted their sin and did as they were ordered. So Allah forgave both the killer and the one killed.\" This is part of the Hadith about the trials that we will mention in Surat Ta Ha, (20) Allah willing.   Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Musa said to his people,  ﴾فَتُوبُواْ إِلَى بَارِئِكُمْ فَاقْتُلُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ ذَلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ عِندَ بَارِئِكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِنَّهُ هُوَ التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ﴿ (\"So turn in repentance to your Creator and kill each other (the innocent kill the wrongdoers among you), that will be better for you with your Creator.\" Then He accepted your repentance. Truly, He is the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful.)   Allah ordered Musa to command his people to kill each other. He ordered those who worshipped the calf to sit down and those who did not worship the calf to stand holding knives in their hands. When they started killing them, a great darkness suddenly overcame them. After the darkness lifted, they had killed seventy thousand of them. Those who were killed among them were forgiven, and those who remained alive were also forgiven.\" p  "

  2,56,"<h2>The Best among the Children of Israel ask to see Allah; their subsequent Death and Resurrection</h2> Allah said, `Remember My favor on you for resurrecting you after you were seized with lightning when you asked to see Me directly, which neither you nor anyone else can bear or attain.' This was said by Ibn Jurayj. Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah  ﴾وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَـمُوسَى لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّى نَرَى اللَّهَ جَهْرَةً﴿ (And (remember) when you said: \"O Musa ! We shall never believe in you until we see Allah plainly.\") means, \"Publicly\", \"So that we gaze at Allah.\" Also, `Urwah bin Ruwaym said that Allah's statement,  ﴾وَأَنتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ﴿ (While you were looking) means, \"Some of them were struck with lightning while others were watching.\" Allah resurrected those, and struck the others with lightning. As-Suddi commented on,  ﴾فَأَخَذَتْكُمُ الصَّـعِقَةُ﴿ (But you were seized with a bolt of lightning) saying; \"They died, and Musa stood up crying and supplicating to Allah, `O Lord! What should I say to the Children of Israel when I go back to them after You destroyed the best of them,  ﴾لَوْ شِئْتَ أَهْلَكْتَهُم مِّن قَبْلُ وَإِيَّـىَ أَتُهْلِكُنَا بِمَا فَعَلَ السُّفَهَآءُ مِنَّآ﴿ (If it had been Your will, You could have destroyed them and me before; would You destroy us for the deeds of the foolish ones among us)' Allah revealed to Musa that these seventy men were among those who worshipped the calf. Afterwards, Allah brought them back to life one man at a time, while the rest of them were watching how Allah was bringing them back to life. That is why Allah's said,  ﴾ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَـكُم مِّن بَعْدِ مَوْتِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ ﴿ (Then We raised you up after your death, so that you might be grateful.)\"   Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said, \"Death was their punishment, and they were resurrected after they died so they could finish out their lives.\" Qatadah said similarly.   `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam commented on this Ayah, \"Musa returned from meeting with his Lord carrying the Tablets on which He wrote the Tawrah. He found that they had worshipped the calf in his absence. Consequently, he commanded them to kill themselves, and they complied, and Allah forgave them. He said to them, `These Tablets have Allah's Book, containing what He commanded you and what He forbade for you.' They said, `Should we believe this statement because you said it By Allah, we will not believe until we see Allah in the open, until He shows us Himself and says: This is My Book, therefore, adhere to it. Why does He not talk to us as He talked to you, O, Musa\"' Then he (`Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd) recited Allah's statement,  ﴾لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّى نَرَى اللَّهَ جَهْرَةً﴿ (We shall never believe in you until we see Allah plainly) and said, \"So Allah's wrath fell upon them, a thunderbolt struck them, and they all died. Then Allah brought them back to life after He killed them.\" Then he (`Abdur-Rahman) recited Allah's statement,  ﴾ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَـكُم مِّن بَعْدِ مَوْتِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ ﴿ (Then We raised you up after your death, so that you might be grateful), and said, \"Musa said to them, `Take the Book of Allah.' They said, `No.' He said, `What is the matter with you' They said, `The problem is that we died and came back to life.' He said, `Take the Book of Allah.' They said, `No.' So Allah sent some angels who made the mountain topple over them.\"   This shows that the Children of Israel were required to fulfill the commandments after they were brought back to life. However, Al-Mawardy said that there are two opinions about this matter. The first opinion is that since the Children of Israel witnessed these miracles, they were compelled to believe, so they did not have to fulfill the commandments. The second opinion states that they were required to adhere to the commandments, so that no responsible adult is free of such responsibilities. Al-Qurtubi said that this is what is correct, because, he said, although the Children of Israel witnessed these tremendous calamities and incidents, that did not mean that they were not responsible for fulfilling the commandments any more. Rather they are responsible for that, and this is clear. Allah knows best.  "
  2,57,"<h2>The Shade, the Manna and the Quail</h2> After Allah mentioned the calamities that He saved the Children of Israel from, He mentioned the favors that He granted them, saying,  وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ الْغَمَامَ  And We shaded you with clouds. This A0yah mentions the white clouds that provided shade for the Children of Israel, protecting them from the sun s heat during their years of wandering. In the Hadith about the trials, An-Nasa0 i recorded Ibn Abba0s saying, Allah shaded the Children of Israel with clouds during the years of wandering. Ibn Abi Hلa0tim said, Narrations similar to that of Ibn Abba0s were reported from Ibn Umar, Ar-Rab0 bin Anas, Abu Mijlaz, Adل-Dلahلhلa0k, and As-Suddi. Al-Hلasan and Qata0dah said that,  وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ الْغَمَامَ  (And We shaded you with clouds) \"This happened when they were in the desert and the clouds shielded them from the sun.\" Ibn Jarir said that several scholars said that the type of cloud the Ayah mentioned, \"was cooler and better than the type we know.\"  `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,  وَأَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ الْمَنَّ  And sent down on you Al-Manna, The manna used to descend to them to the trees, and they used to eat whatever they wished of it. Also, Qata0dah said, The manna, which was whiter than milk and sweeter than honey, used to rain down on the Children of Israel, just as the snow falls, from dawn until sunrise. One of them would collect enough for that particular day, for if it remained more than that, it would spoil. On the sixth day, Friday, one would collect enough for the sixth and the seventh day, which was the Sabbath during which one would not leave home to seek his livelihood, or for anything else. All this occurred in the wilderness. The type of manna that we know provides sufficient food when eaten alone, because it is nutritious and sweet. When manna is mixed with water, it becomes a sweet drink. It also changes composition when mixed with other types of food. However, this is not the only type. The evidence to this fact is that Al-Bukha0ri narrated, that Sa 0d bin Zayd said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «الْكَمْأَةُ مِنَ الْمَنِّ وَمَاؤُهَا شِفَاءٌ لِلْعَيْن»  (Kam'ah (truffles) is a type of manna, and its liquid is a remedy for the eyes.)  This Hadith was also collected by Imam Ahmad. The group of Hadith compilers, with the exception of Abu Dawud, also collected it, and At-Tirmidhi graded it Hasan Sahih. At-Tirmidhi recorded Abu Hurayrah saying that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «الْعَجْوَةُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَفِيهَا شِفَاءٌ مِنَ السُّمِّ وَالْكَمْأَةُ مِنَ الْمَنِّ وَمَاؤُهَا شِفَاءٌ لِلْعَيْن»  (The `Ajwah (pressed, dried date) is from Paradise and it cures poison, Al-Kam'ah (truffles) is a form of manna, and its liquid heals the eye.\") At-Tirmidhi is the only one of them who recorded this Hadith.  As for the quail (Salwa) in question, `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The (Salwa) is a bird that looks like the quail.\" This is the same opinion reported from Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, may Allah have mercy upon them. Also, `Ikrimah said that the Salwa is a bird in Paradise about the size of a sparrow. Qatadah said \"The Salwa is a bird that is similar to a sparrow. During that time, an Israelite could catch as many quails as was sufficient for that particular day, otherwise the meat would spoil. On the sixth day, Friday, he would collect what is enough for the sixth and the seventh day, the Sabbath, during which one was not allowed to depart his home to seek anything.\"  Allah said,  كُلُواْ مِن طَيِّبَـتِ مَا رَزَقْنَـكُمْ  (Eat of the good lawful things We have provided for you,) (7:160) this form of command is a simple order of allowance, guiding to what is good. Allah said,  وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ  (And they did not wrong Us but they wronged themselves) means, `We commanded them to eat from what We gave them, and to perform the acts of worship (but they rebelled).' This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement,  كُلُواْ مِن رِّزْقِ رَبِّكُمْ وَاشْكُرُواْ لَهُ  (Eat of the provision of your Lord, and be grateful to Him) (34:15).  Yet, the Children of Israel rebelled, disbelieved and committed injustice against themselves, even though they saw the clear signs, tremendous miracles and extraordinary events. <h2>The Virtue of Muhammad's ﷺ Companions over the Companions of all Other Prophets</h2> Here it is important to point out the virtue of Muhammad's ﷺ Companions over the companions of the other Prophets. This includes firmness in the religion, patience and the lack of arrogance, may Allah be pleased with them. Although the Companions accompanied the Prophet in his travels and battles, such as during the battle of Tabuk, in intense heat and hardship, they did not ask for a miracle, though this was easy for the Prophet by Allah's leave. And when the Companions became hungry, they merely asked the Prophet - to invoke Allah - for an increase in the amount of food. They collected whatever food they had and brought it to the Prophet , and he asked Allah to bless it, told each of them to take some food, and they filled every pot they had. Also, when they needed rain, the Prophet asked Allah to send down rain, and a rain cloud came. They drank, gave water to their camels and filled their water skins. When they looked around, they found that the cloud had only rained on their camp. This is the best example of those who were willing to accept Allah's decision and follow the Messenger of Allah ﷺ .
