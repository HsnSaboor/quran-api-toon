tafsir[13]{c,v,t}:
  20,52,"<h2>The Conversation between Musa and Fir`awn</h2> Allah, the Exalted, informs about Fir`awn that he said to Musa, in his rejection of the existence of a Supreme Maker and Creator, Who is the God of everything and his own Lord and Owner:  ﴾فَمَن رَّبُّكُمَا يمُوسَى﴿ (Who then, O Musa, is the Lord of you two) meaning \"Who is the one who called you forth and sent you For verily, I do not know him and I have not given you any god other than myself.\"  ﴾قَالَ رَبُّنَا الَّذِى أَعْطَى كُلَّ شَىءٍ خَلْقَهُ ثُمَّ هَدَى ﴿ ((Musa) said: \"Our Lord is He Who gave to each thing its form and nature, then guided it aright.\") `Ali bin Abi Talhah related that Ibn `Abbas said, \"He is saying that He created a mate for everything.\" Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"He made the man a man, and the donkey a donkey and the sheep a sheep.\" Layth bin Abi Sulaym reported from Mujahid that he said, \"He gave everything its form.\" Ibn Abi Najih said that Mujahid said, \"He fashioned the creation of every moving creature.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said concerning His statement,  ﴾أَعْطَى كُلَّ شَىءٍ خَلْقَهُ ثُمَّ هَدَى﴿ ((Who) gave to each thing its form and nature, then guided it aright.) \"He gave each of His creatures what is suitable for its creation.\" Therefore, He did not give man the form of a wild beast, nor did He give wild beasts the form of the dog. Likewise, the dog's form is not like the sheep's. He also gave creature a suitable spouse, and He influenced everything towards that mate. There is no species of creation that is exactly like another species. They are different in their actions, their forms, their sustenance and their mating. Some of the scholars of Tafsir have said that this statement, \"He gave to each thing its form and nature, then guided it aright,\" is similar to Allah's statement,  ﴾وَالَّذِى قَدَّرَ فَهَدَى ﴿ (And Who has measured; and then guided.) 87:3 This means He measured out an ordained amount (of sustenance, actions, etc.) and then guided His creatures to it. He wrote the deeds, the appointed times of death and the provisions. Then, the creatures traverse upon that and they are not able to avoid it, nor are they able to abandon it. In this Ayah Musa is saying that our Lord is the One Who created the creation, measured out its ordainment and compelled the creatures to that which He wanted.  ﴾قَالَ فَمَا بَالُ الْقُرُونِ الاٍّولَى ﴿ ((Fir`awn) said: \"What about the generations of old\") The most correct opinion concerning the meaning of this, is that when Musa informed Fir`awn that his Lord Who sent him is the One Who creates, sustains, ordains and guides, Fir`awn began to argue, using the previous generations as a proof. He was referring to those people of old who did not worship Allah. In other words, \"If the matter is as you say, then what happened to those people They did not worship your Lord. Instead they worshipped other gods besides Him.\" Musa said to him, in response to this, that if they did not worship Allah, then Allah knows precisely what happened to them and He will give them just recompense for their deeds, as is written in Allah's Book (of decrees). This Book is called Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (The Preserved Tablet) and it is the Book of Deeds.  ﴾لاَّ يَضِلُّ رَبِّى وَلاَ يَنسَى﴿ (My Lord neither errs nor forgets.) This means that nothing eludes Him and He does not miss anything, whether it is small or great. He does not forget anything and His Most Exalted knowledge is described as encompassing everything. Blessed be He, the Exalted, the Most Holy and free of any imperfections. The knowledge that creatures have has two deficiencies. The first is that it does not completely encompass anything, and the second is that the creature is prone to forget after knowing. Therefore, Allah has declared Himself above such deficiencies.  "

  20,56,"<h2>The Completion of Musa's Reply to Fir`awn</h2> This is from the completion of Musa's speech concerning the description of His Lord when Fir`awn asked him about Him. He (Musa) said,  ﴾الَّذِى أَعْطَى كُلَّ شَىءٍ خَلْقَهُ ثُمَّ هَدَى﴿ (He Who gave to each thing its form and nature, then guided it aright.) Then, Fir`awn attempted to present some argumentative rebuttal during Musa's reply. Yet, Musa continued by saying, \"He is the One Who made the earth as a bed for you.\" Some recited the word as Mihadan and others recited it as Mahdan, which means `a place of rest that you settle down upon.' It also may mean `that which you stand upon, sleep upon or travel upon its back.'  ﴾وَسَلَكَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً﴿ (and has opened ways for you therein.) This means, `He made roads for you to walk upon their shoulders.' This is just as He, the Exalted, said,  ﴾وَجَعَلْنَا فِيهَا فِجَاجاً سُبُلاً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ﴿ (And placed therein broad highways for them to pass through, that they may be guided.) 21:31  ﴾وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَخْرَجْنَا بِهِ أَزْوَاجاً مِّن نَّبَـتٍ شَتَّى﴿ (and has sent down water from the sky. And We have brought forth with it various kinds of vegetation.) referring to the various species of plants, such as vegetation and fruits. Some are sour, some are sweet, some are bitter and there are other kinds as well.  ﴾كُلُواْ وَارْعَوْا أَنْعَـمَكُمْ﴿ (Eat and pasture your cattle (therein);) meaning, `something that is food for you and a palatable fruit for you, and something that is for your cattle as fodder for them, both green and dry.'  ﴾إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لأيَـتٍ﴿ (Verily, in this are Ayat.) This means proofs, signs and evidences.  ﴾لاٌّوْلِى النُّهَى﴿ (for men of understanding.) meaning those who possess correct and upright intelligence realizing that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, and there is no true Lord other than Him.  ﴾مِنْهَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ وَفِيهَا نُعِيدُكُمْ وَمِنْهَا نُخْرِجُكُمْ تَارَةً أُخْرَى ﴿ (Thereof We created you, and into it we shall return you, and from it We shall bring you out once again.) meaning, `the earth is your beginning. For your father, Adam, was created with dirt from the surface of the earth. You also will be returned to the earth. This means that you will become dirt when you die and decay.' The statement, \"And from it We shall bring you out once again,\" means,  ﴾يَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَتَظُنُّونَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً ﴿ (On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer with His praise and obedience, and you will think that you have stayed (in this world) but a little while!) 17:52 This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement,  ﴾قَالَ فِيهَا تَحْيَوْنَ وَفِيهَا تَمُوتُونَ وَمِنْهَا تُخْرَجُونَ ﴿ (He said: \"Therein you shall live, and therein you shall die, and from it you shall be brought out.\") 7:25  <h2>Musa showed Fir`awn all of the Signs but He did not believe Concerning Allah's statement,</h2>﴾وَلَقَدْ أَرَيْنَـهُ ءَايَـتِنَا كُلَّهَا فَكَذَّبَ وَأَبَى ﴿ (And indeed We showed him (Fir`awn) all Our Ayat, but he denied and refused.) This means that the proofs, signs and evi- dences were establi- shed against Fir`awn and he saw them with his own eyes, but he still denied and rejec- ted them due to his disbelief, abstinence and transgression. This is as Allah, the Exalted, says,  ﴾وَجَحَدُواْ بِهَا وَاسْتَيْقَنَتْهَآ أَنفُسُهُمْ ظُلْماً وَعُلُوّاً﴿ (And they belied them wrongfully and arrogantly, though they themselves were convinced thereof.) 27:14  "

  20,59,"<h2>Fir`awn describes Musa's Proofs as being Magic and Their Agreement to hold a Contest</h2> Allah, the Exalted, informs of what Fir`awn said to Musa when he showed him the great proof. This great sign to Fir`awn was Musa casting down his stick which became a huge snake, and his pulling his hand out from under his arm while it was glowing white without any illness. At this, Fir`awn said, \"This is magic that you have brought to us to bewitch us and conquer the people, so that they will follow you. Then you will outnumber us.\" Fir`awn then said, \"Your plan will not work. We have magic just like yours, so do not let yourself be deceived by that what you are doing.\"  ﴾فَاجْعَلْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكَ مَوْعِداً﴿ (so appoint a meeting between us and you,) Meaning, `a day that we can come together to present some of our magic to confront yours. It will be at a specified place and time.' With this, Musa said to them,  ﴾مَوْعِدُكُمْ يَوْمُ الزِّينَةِ﴿ (Your appointed meeting is the day of festival,) That was the day of their celebration and their New Year's festivity. It was a holiday for them when they took vacation from their work and came together for a large gathering. This day was selected so that all of the people could witness the power of Allah to do whatever He wills. They would see the miracles of the prophets and the futility of magic to contest the supernatural prophetic powers. This is why Musa said,  ﴾وَأَن يُحْشَرَ النَّاسُ﴿ (and let the people assemble) meaning all of them.  ﴾ضُحًى﴿ (when the sun has risen (forenoon).) meaning in the morning, just before noon. In this way the contest will be most visible, well lit, apparent and obvious in plain view. This is the way of the Prophets. Their work is always clear and apparent. It is never something hidden, or something for sale. This is why he did not say that the meeting should be at night, but rather, it was to be held during the bright part of the day. Ibn `Abbas said, \"The day of their festivity was the day of `Ashura'.\" As-Suddi, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said, \"It was the day of their great celebration.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"It was the day of their great bazzar.\" These statements are not contradictory. I say that Allah destroyed Fir`awn and his armies on a day similar to this, just as is confirmed in the Sahih. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, \"It was a flat place where all of the people were on the same level, having an equal view of the event. There was nothing there that would obstruct the view so that some people could see what others did not.\"  "

  20,64,"<h2>The Meeting of the Two Parties, Musa's Propagation of the Message and the Magicians</h2> Allah, the Exalted informs that when Fir`awn and Musa agreed to an appointed meeting at a specified place and time, Fir`awn began to gather some magicians from the cities of his kingdom. Every person who had any affiliation with magic at that time was summoned, and magic was very widespread and in demand at that time. This is as Allah says,  ﴾وَقَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ ائْتُونِى بِكُلِّ سَـحِرٍ عَلِيمٍ ﴿ (And Fir`awn said: \"Bring me every well-versed sorcerer.\") 10:79 Then, the day came. It was the day when all of the people gathered, which was well-known, being the day of the festival. Fir`awn was there sitting upon his throne surrounded by the elite officials of his kingdom. The subjects were all standing on his right and his left. Then, Musa came forward leaning upon his stick accompanied by his brother Harun. The magicians were standing in front of Fir`awn in rows and he was prodding them, inciting them and encouraging them to do their best on this day. They wanted to please him and he was promising them and inspiring them. They said,  ﴾فَلَمَّا جَآءَ السَّحَرَةُ قَالُواْ لِفِرْعَوْنَ أَإِنَّ لَنَا لاّجْراً إِن كُنَّا نَحْنُ الْغَـلِبِينَ - قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ إِذاً لَّمِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ ﴿ (Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners He (Fir`awn) said: \"Yes, and you shall then verily be of those brought near (to myself).\") 26:41-42  ﴾قَالَ لَهُمْ مُّوسَى وَيْلَكُمْ لاَ تَفْتَرُواْ عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِباً﴿ (Musa said to them: \"Woe unto you! Invent not a lie against Allah...\") This means, \"Do not make an illusion before the people of something that is not real, making it appear as if it were a creature, when it is not really a creature. If you do this, then you would be lying on Allah.\"  ﴾فَيُسْحِتَكُم بِعَذَابٍ﴿ (lest He (Allah) should destroy you completely by a torment.) This means, `He will destroy you with a destructive punishment that will not spare anything, or anyone.'  ﴾وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنِ افْتَرَىفَتَنَـزَعُواْ أَمْرَهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ﴿ (\"...And surely, he who invents a lie will fail miserably.\" Then they debated one with another what they must do,) It has been said that this means that they argued among themselves. So one of them said, \"This is not the speech of a magician, but it is the speech of a Prophet.\" Another said, \"No, he is only a magician.\" There are other opinions that have been mentioned about what they discussed. And Allah knows best. Allah's statement,  ﴾وَأَسَرُّواْ النَّجْوَى﴿ (and they kept their talk secret.) means, they held secret counsel among themselves about this matter.  ﴾قَالُواْ إِنْ هَـذَنِ لَسَاحِرَنِ﴿ (They said: \"Verily, these are two Hadhan magicians...\") This is a way of speaking with some of the Arabs and this Ayah has been recited according to the grammar of their dialect. There are also others who recite it as, (إِنَّ هَذَيْنِ لَسَاحِرَانِ) Which carries the same meaning, \"Verily, these are two Hadhayn magicians.\" This is the popular style of language in Arabic grammar. The grammarians have extensive discussions in reply to the first recitation and its grammatical explanation, but this is not the place for such a discussion. The main point is that the magicians said among themselves, \"You all know that this man and his brother (Musa and Harun) are two knowledgeable magicians who are quite aware of the skill of magic. They want to defeat you and your people today and conquer the people, causing the masses to follow them. They want to fight against Fir`awn and his armies, and they are seeking victory over him. And their ultimate goal is to expel you from your land.\" Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾وَيَذْهَبَا بِطَرِيقَتِكُمُ الْمُثْلَى﴿ (and to take you away from your exemplary way.) This means, `they want to expose this way (of yours) openly, which is magic.' For verily, they were considered great because of their magic. They had wealth and sustenance because of this magic. They were actually saying, \"If these two (Musa and Harun) are victorious, they will destroy you and expel you from your land. In doing so, they will be the first individuals to do so, and they will be given great power of leadership without you.\" Ibn `Abbas mentioned concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾وَيَذْهَبَا بِطَرِيقَتِكُمُ الْمُثْلَى﴿ (and to take you away from your exemplary way. ) \"This means their kingdom, which they were in, and their livelihood.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd said, \"This superior way means that which they were upon.\"  ﴾فَأَجْمِعُواْ كَيْدَكُمْ ثُمَّ ائْتُواْ صَفّاً﴿ (So devise your plot, and assemble in line.) This means, \"All of you come together in one row, and throw that which is in your hands at one time in order to dazzle the eyes (of the people) and defeat this man and his brother.\"  ﴾وَقَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْيَوْمَ مَنِ اسْتَعْلَى﴿ (And whoever overcomes this day will be indeed successful.) meaning \"Between you and us. As for us (the magicians), we have been promised to be given an abundance of power and sovereignty. And in reference to him (Musa), He will gain great leadership.\"  "
