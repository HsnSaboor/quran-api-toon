tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  57,19,"<h2>Reward for the Charitable, the True Believers and the Martyrs; and the Destination of the Disbelieve</h2> Allah the Exalted describes the reward that He will award to those who spend from their wealth, whether male or female, on the needy, the poor and the meek,  اللَّهَ قَرْضاً حَسَناً وَمَا  (and lend Allah handsome loan,) meaning, they give in charity with a good heart seeking the pleasure of Allah. They do not seek worldly rewards or appreciation from those to whom they give in charity. Allah's statement,  يُضَـعَفُ لَهُمْ  (it shall be increased manifold,) indicating that He will multiply the good deeds from tenfold, up to seven hundredfold and even more than that,  وَلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ كَرِيمٌ  (and theirs shall be an honorable good reward.) theirs will be a generous, handsome reward, a good dwelling to return to and an honorable final destination. Allah's statement,  وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الصِّدِّيقُونَ  (And those who believe in Allah and His Messengers -- they are the Siddiqun) This completes His description of those who have faith in Him and in His Messengers, by describing them as Siddiqun, true believers. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas about  وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الصِّدِّيقُونَ  (And those who believe in Allah and His Messengers -- they are the Siddiqun) that its meaning does not continue to the next Ayah,  وَالشُّهَدَآءُ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ وَنُورُهُمْ  (and the martyrs (are) with their Lord. They shall have their reward and their light.) Abu Ad-Duha (stopped after he) recited,  أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الصِّدِّيقُونَ  (they are the Siddiqun), then initiated recitation:  وَالشُّهَدَآءُ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ  (and the martyrs (are) with their Lord.) Masruq, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil bin Hayyan and others said similarly. Al-A`mash narrated from Abu Ad-Duha from Masruq from `Abdullah bin Mas`ud commented on Allah's statement,  أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الصِّدِّيقُونَ وَالشُّهَدَآءُ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ  (they are the Siddiqun, and the martyrs with their Lord.) \"They are of three categories,\" meaning there are those who spend in charity, the Siddiqun and the martyrs. Allah the Exalted said,  وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّينَ وَالصِّدِّيقِينَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَالصَّـلِحِينَ  (And whoso obey Allah and the Messenger, then they will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His grace, of the Prophets, the Siddiqin, the martyrs, and the righteous.)(4:69) Therefore, Allah made a distinction between the Siddiqin and the martyrs, indicating that they are of two distinct categories, so there is no doubt that Siddiq is a better status than the martyr. Imam Malik bin Anas recorded in his Muwatta' that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِنَّ أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ لَيَتَرَاءَوْنَ أَهْلَ الْغُرَفِ مِنْ فَوْقِهِمْ، كَمَا تَتَرَاءَوْنَ الْكَوْكَبَ الدُّرِّيَّ الْغَابِرَ فِي الْأُفُقِ مِنَ الْمَشْرِقِ أَوِ الْمَغْرِبِ، لِتَفَاضُلِ مَا بَيْنَهُم»  (The people of Paradise will look at the dwellers of the lofty mansions as one looks at a brilliant star far away in the east or in the west on the horizon, because of their superiority over one another.) On that the people said, \"O Allah's Messenger! Are these lofty mansions for the Prophets whom none else can reach\" The Prophet replied,  «بَلَى، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، رِجَالٌ آمَنُوا بِاللهِ وَصَدَّقُوا الْمُرْسَلِين»  (No! By Him in Whose Hand is my soul! these are for men who believe in Allah and believe in the Messengers.) Al-Bukhari and Muslim also collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,  وَالشُّهَدَآءُ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ  (and the martyrs with their Lord.) means that they will be in the gardens of Paradise, as recorded in the Sahih:  «إِنَّ أَرْوَاحَ الشُّهَدَاءِ فِي حَوَاصِلِ طَيْرٍ خُضْرٍ تَسْرَحُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ شَاءَتْ، ثُمَّ تَأْوِي إِلَى تِلْكَ الْقَنَادِيلِ فَاطَّلَعَ عَلَيْهِمْ رَبُّكَ اطِّلَاعَةً فَقَالَ: مَاذَا تُرِيدُونَ؟ فَقَالُوا: نُحِبُّ أَنْ تَرُدَّنَا إِلَى الدَّارِ الدُّنْيَا فَنُقَاتِلَ فِيكَ فَنُقْتَلَ، كَمَا قُتِلْنَا أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ، فَقَالَ: إِنِّي قَدْ قَضَيْتُ أَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْهَا لَا يَرْجِعُون»  (The souls of the martyrs live in the bodies of green birds, who fly wherever they wish in Paradise and then return to their nests in chandeliers. Once your Lord cast a glance at them and said, `Do you want anything\" They said, \"We wish that You return us to the life of the world, so that we may fight in Your cause and be killed as we were killed the first time.\" Allah said, \"I have decreed that they shall not be returned to it again.\") Allah's statement,  لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ وَنُورُهُمْ  (They shall have their reward and their light.), means that Allah will grant them a generous reward and a tremendous light that will precede before them. In this, the believers vary regarding the level of reward they receive, according to their good actions in the life of this world. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,  «الشُّهَدَاءُ أَرْبَعَةٌ: رَجُلٌ مُؤْمِنٌ جَيِّدُ الْإِيمَانِ، لَقِيَ الْعَدُوَّ فَصَدَقَ اللهَ فَقُتِلَ، فَذَاكَ الَّذِي يَنْظُرُ النَّاسُ إِلَيْهِ هكَذَا»  (There are four ranks of martyrs. The first is a man who believes and who is true in faith, who meets the enemy (in battle), fulfills his duty to Allah and is killed. This is the type that the people will look up to (his level in Paradise), like this.) The Prophet raised his head until his cap fell off his head, and the same happened to `Umar. The Prophet continued,  «وَالثَّانِي مُؤْمِنٌ لَقِيَ الْعَدُوَّ فَكَأَنَّمَا يُضْرَبُ ظَهْرُهُ بِشَوْكِ الطَّلْحِ، جَاءَهُ سَهْمٌ غَرْبٌ فَقَتَلَهُ، فَذَاكَ فِي الدَّرَجَةِ الثَّانِيَةِ. وَالثَّالِثُ رَجُلٌ مُؤْمِنٌ خَلَطَ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا وَآخَرَ سَيِّئًا، لَقِيَ الْعَدُوَّ فَصَدَقَ اللهَ حَتْى قُتِلَ، فَذَاكَ فِي الدَّرَجَةِ الثَّالِثَةِ. وَالرَّابِعُ رَجُلٌ مُؤْمِنٌ أَسْرَفَ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ إِسْرَافًا كَثِيرًا، لَقِيَ الْعَدُوَّ فَصَدَقَ اللهَ حَتْى قُتِلَ، فَذَاكَ فِي الدَّرَجَةِ الرَّابِعَة»  (The second is a believer who meets the enemy and is struck by a stray arrow which causes him to die. This believer is in the second grade. The third is a believer who has combined good deeds with evil deeds; he meets the enemy and is truthful to his duty to Allah until he is killed. This is the third category. And the fourth is a believer who has committed sins excessively, so he meets the enemy and is truthful to his duty to Allah, and is killed. This is the fourth category.) `Ali bin Al-Madini also reported this Hadith and said, \"This Egyptian chain is Salih useful.\" At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Gharib.\" Allah's statement,  وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَآ أُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَحِيمِ  (But those who disbelieve and deny Our Ayat -- they shall be the dwellers of the blazing Fire.) mentions the destination and the condition of the miserable ones, after Allah mentioned the destination and rewards of the happy ones.

  57,21,"<h2>This Life of this World is Fleeting Enjoyment</h2> Allah the Exalted degrades the significance of this life and belittles it by saying,  أَنَّمَا الْحَيَوةُ الدُّنْيَا لَعِبٌ وَلَهْوٌ وَزِينَةٌ وَتَفَاخُرٌ بَيْنَكُمْ وَتَكَاثُرٌ فِى الاٌّمْوَلِ وَالاٌّوْلْـدِ  (that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children.) meaning, this is the significance of this life to its people, just as He said in another Ayah,  زُيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ حُبُّ الشَّهَوَتِ مِنَ النِّسَآءِ وَالْبَنِينَ وَالْقَنَـطِيرِ الْمُقَنطَرَةِ مِنَ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ وَالْخَيْلِ الْمُسَوَّمَةِ وَالأَنْعَـمِ وَالْحَرْثِ ذَلِكَ مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَاللَّهُ عِندَهُ حُسْنُ الْمَأَبِ  (Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women, children, much of gold and silver (wealth), branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land. This is the pleasure of the present world's life; but Allah has the excellent return with Him.)(3:14) Allah the Exalted also sets a parable for this life, declaring that its joys are fading and its delights are perishable, saying that life is,  كَمَثَلِ غَيْثٍ  (Like a rain (Ghayth),) which is the rain that comes down to mankind, after they had felt despair. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,  وَهُوَ الَّذِى يُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا قَنَطُواْ  (And He it is Who sends down the Ghayth (rain) after they have despaired.)(42:28) Allah's statement,  أَعْجَبَ الْكُفَّارَ نَبَاتُهُ  (thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller;) meaning that farmers admire the vegetation that grows in the aftermath of rain. And just as farmers admire vegetation, the disbelievers admire this life; they are the most eager to acquire the traits of life, and life is most dear to them,  ثُمَّ يَهِيجُ فَتَرَاهُ مُصْفَرّاً ثُمَّ يَكُونُ حُطَاماً  (afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw.) meaning, that vegetation soon turns yellow in color, after being fresh and green. After that, the green fades away and becomes scattered pieces of dust. This is the parable of this worldly life, it starts young, then matures and then turns old and feeble. This is also the parable of mankind in this life; they are young and strong in the beginning. In this stage of life, they look youthful and handsome. Slowly, they begin growing older, their mannerism changes and their strength weakens. They then grow old and feeble; moving becomes difficult for them, while doing easy things becomes beyond their ability. Allah the Exalted said,  اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن ضَعْفٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ ضَعْفٍ قُوَّةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ قُوَّةٍ ضَعْفاً وَشَيْبَةً يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيمُ الْقَدِيرُ  (Allah is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness and grey hair. He creates what He wills. And He is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.)(30:54) This parable indicates the near demise of this life and the imminent end of it, while in contrast, the Hereafter is surely coming. Those who hear this parable should, therefore, be aware of the significance of the Hereafter and feel eagerness in the goodness that it contains,  وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَنٌ وَمَا الْحَيَوةُ الدُّنْيَآ إِلاَّ مَتَـعُ الْغُرُورِ  (But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment, and (there is) forgiveness from Allah and (His) pleasure. And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.) meaning, surely, the Hereafter that will certainly come contains two things either severe punishment or forgiveness from Allah and His good pleasure. Allah the Exalted said,  وَما الْحَيَوةُ الدُّنْيَا إِلاَّ مَتَـعُ الْغُرُورِ  (And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.) meaning, this life is only a form of enjoyment that deceives those who incline to it. Surely, those who recline to this life will admire it and feel that it is dear to them, so much so, that they might think that this is the only life, no life or dwelling after it. Yet, in reality, this life is insignificant as compared to the Hereafter. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «لَلْجَنَّةُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَى أَحَدِكُمْ مِنْ شِرَاكِ نَعْلِهِ، وَالنَّارُ مِثْلُ ذلِك»  (Paradise is nearer to any of you than the strap on his shoe, and so is the (Hell) Fire.) Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith through the narration of Ath-Thawri. This Hadith indicates the close proximity of both good and evil in relation to mankind. If this is the case, then this is the reason Allah the Exalted encouraged mankind to rush to perform acts of righteousness and obedience and to avoid the prohibitions. By doing so, their sins and errors will be forgiven and they will acquire rewards and an exalted status. Allah the Exalted said,  سَابِقُواْ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا كَعَرْضِ السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ  (Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord, and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth,) Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,  وَسَارِعُواْ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا السَّمَـوَتُ وَالاٌّرْضُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ  (And march forth in the way (to) forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who have Taqwa.)(3:133) Allah said here,  أُعِدَّتْ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ ذَلِكَ فَضْلُ اللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ  (prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers. That is the grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He is pleased with. And Allah is the Owner of great bounty.) meaning, \"This, that Allah has qualified them for, is all a part of His favor, bounty and compassion.\" We mentioned a Hadith collected in the Sahih in which the poor emigrants said to the Messenger ﷺ, \"O Allah's Messenger! The wealthy people will get higher grades and permanent enjoyment.\" He asked,  «وَمَا ذَاكَ؟»  (Why is that) They said, \"They pray like us and fast as we do. However, they give in charity, whereas we cannot do that, and that free servants, whereas we cannot afford it.\" The Prophet said,  «أَفَلَا أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَى شَيْءٍ إِذَا فَعَلْتُمُوهُ سَبَقْتُمْ مَنْ بَعْدَكُمْ، وَلَا يَكُونُ أَحَدٌ أَفْضَلَ مِنْكُمْ إِلَّا مَنْ صَنَعَ مِثْلَ مَا صَنَعْتُمْ: تُسَبِّحُونَ وَتُكَبِّرُونَ وَتُحَمِّدُونَ دُبُرَ كُلِّ صَلَاةٍ ثَلَاثًا وَثَلَاثِين»  (Shall I tell you of a good deed that, if you acted upon, you would catch up with those who have surpassed you none would overtake you and be better than you, except those who might do the same. Say, \"Glorious is Allah,\" \"Allah is Most Great,\" and \"Praise be to Allah,\" thirty three times each after every prayer.) They later came back and said, \"Our wealthy brethren heard what we did and they started doing the same.\" Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,  «ذلِكَ فَضْلُ اللهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَنْ يَشَاء»  This is the favor of Allah that He gives to whom He wills.) "

  57,24,"<h2>Everything that affects Mankind, is duly measured and destined</h2> Allah reminds of His measuring and deciding the destiny of all things before He created the creation,  مَآ أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ فِى أَنفُسِكُمْ  (No calamity occurs on the earth nor in yourselves) meaning, `there is nothing that touches you or happens in existence,'  إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن نَّبْرَأَهَآ  (but it is inscribed in the Book of Decrees before We bring it into existence.) meaning, `before We created the creation and started life.' Qatadah commented on this Ayah,  مَآ أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِى الاٌّرْضِ  (No calamity occurs on the earth) refers to famine, while,  وَلاَ فِى أَنفُسِكُمْ  (or nor in yourselves) refers to suffering and diseases.\" He also said, \"We were told that every person who suffers a prick of a thorn, a twisted ankle, or a bleeding vein, has it occur on account of his sins. What Allah forgives is even more.\" This great, honorable Ayah provides clear evidence to the misguidance of the cursed Qadariyyah sect, who deny Allah's Preordaihnent and His knowledge of everything before it occurs. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,  «قَدَّرَ اللهُ الْمَقَادِيرَ قَبلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَة»  (Allah ordained the measures (of everything) fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth.)\" Muslim collected this Hadith in his Sahih with the addition:  «وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاء»  (And His Throne was over the water.) At-Tirmidhi also collected it and said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" Allah's statement,  إِنَّ ذلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ  (Verily, that is easy for Allah.) means that He knows all things before they occur, and He records them exactly as they will occur when they occur, and this is easy for Him. Verily, Allah knows what happened, what will happen and what did not happen, and what shape and form it will take if it were to happen. <h2>Ordering Patience and Gratitude</h2> Allah said,  لِّكَيْلاَ تَأْسَوْاْ عَلَى مَا فَاتَكُمْ وَلاَ تَفْرَحُواْ بِمَآ ءَاتَـكُمْ  (In order that you may not grieve at the things over that you fail to get, nor rejoice over that which has been given to you.) meaning, `We informed you of Our encompassing knowledge, recording all things before they occur and creating all things in due measure known to Us, so that you may know that what has met you would never have missed you and what has missed you would never have met you. Therefore, do not grieve for what you have missed of fortune, because had it been destined for you, you would have achieved it.' (It is also recited:) (وَلَا تَفْرَحُوْا بِمَا أَتَاكُمْ) (nor rejoice over that which came to you) meaning, come to you. According to the recitation,  ءَاتَـكُمُ  it means (which has been given to you.) Both meanings are related. Allah says here, `do not boast before people about what Allah has favored you with, because it is not you who earned it by your efforts. Rather, all this came your way because Allah destined them for you and provided them for you as provisions. Therefore, do not use what Allah has granted you as a reason to boast and become arrogant with others.' Allah's statement,  وَاللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ كُلَّ مُخْتَالٍ فَخُورٍ  (And Allah likes not prideful boasters.) meaning, who acts arrogantly with other people. `Ikrimah commented by saying, \"Everyone of us feels happiness and grief. However, make your joy with gratitude and endure your grief with patience.\" <h2>Censuring the Stinginess</h2> Allah the Exalted then said,  الَّذِينَ يَبْخَلُونَ وَيَأْمُرُونَ النَّاسَ بِالْبُخْلِ  (Those who are misers and enjoin miserliness upon people.) meaning those who commit evil and encourage people to commit it,  وَمَن يَتَوَلَّ  (And whosoever turns away,) from abiding by Allah's commandments and obeying Him,  فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْغَنِىُّ الْحَمِيدُ  (then Allah is Rich, Worthy of all praise.) As Musa, peace be upon him, said,  إِن تَكْفُرُواْ أَنتُمْ وَمَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ جَمِيعًا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَغَنِىٌّ حَمِيدٌ  (If you disbelieve, you and all on earth together, then verily, Allah is Rich, Owner of all praise.)(14:8) "
