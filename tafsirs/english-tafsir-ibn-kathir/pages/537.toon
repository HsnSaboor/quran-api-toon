  56,82,"<h2>Allah swears to the Greatness of the Qur'an</h2> The usage of La (in Fala) is not an extra character without meaning, as some of the scholars of Tafsir say. Rather it is used at the beginning of an oath when the oath is a negation. This is like when `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her said, \"La by Allah! Allah's Messenger ﷺ did not touch any woman's hand at all. So in this way, the meaning is, \"No! I swear by the Mawaqi` of the stars. The matter is not as you people claim - about the Qur'an - that it is a result of magic or sorcery, rather it is an Honorable Qur'an.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"Some of the scholars of the Arabic language said that the meaning of:  فَلاَ أُقْسِمُ  (Fala! I swear) is, `The matter is not as you people have claimed.' Then He renews the oath again by saying, `I swear.\"'  فَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِمَوَقِعِ النُّجُومِ  (Fala! I swear by the Mawaqi` of the stars.) Mujahid said, \"The setting positions of the stars in the sky,\" and he said that it refers to the rising and setting positions. This was said by Al-Hasan, Qatadah and preferred by Ibn Jarir. Qatadah also said that it means their positions. Allah said,  وَإِنَّهُ لَقَسَمٌ لَّوْ تَعْلَمُونَ عَظِيمٌ  (And verily that is indeed a great oath, if you but know.) meaning, `this is a great vow that I -- Allah -- am making; if you knew the greatness of this vow, you will know the greatness of the subject of the vow,'  إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ  (That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation.) means, verily, this Qur'an that was revealed to Muhammad ﷺ is a Glorious Book,  فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ  (In a Book Maknun.) meaning glorious; in a glorious, well-guarded, revered Book. Ibn Jarir narrated that Isma`il bin Musa said that Sharik reported from Hakim, that is Ibn Jubayr, from Sa`id bin Jubayr, from Ibn `Abbas that about:  لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ  (Which none touches but the pure ones.) he said, \"The Book that is in heaven.\" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas about:  لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ  (Which none touches but the pure ones.) that `the pure ones' means: \"The angels.\" Similar was said by Anas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak, Abu Ash-Sha`tha' Jabir bin Zayd, Abu Nahik, As-Suddi, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and others. Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abdul-A`la said that Ibn Thawr said that Ma`mar said from Qatadah about:  لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ  (Which none touches but the pure ones.) that he said, \"None can touch it, with Allah, except the pure ones. However, in this life, the impure Zoroastrian and the filthy hypocrite touch it.\" And he said, \"In the recitation of Ibn Mas`ud it is: (مَا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ) (It is not touched, except by the pure ones.) Abu Al-`Aliyah said:  لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ  (Which none touches but the pure ones.) \"It does not refer to you, because you are sinners!\" Ibn Zayd said, \"The Quraysh disbelievers claimed that the devils brought down the Qur'an. Allah the Exalted stated that only the pure ones touch the Qur'an, as He said:  وَمَا تَنَزَّلَتْ بِهِ الشَّيَـطِينُ - وَمَا يَنبَغِى لَهُمْ وَمَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ - إِنَّهُمْ عَنِ السَّمْعِ لَمَعْزُولُونَ  (And it is not the Shayatin who have brought it down. Neither would it suit them nor they can (produce it). Verily, they have been removed far from hearing it.)(26:210-212)\" This saying is a good saying, and does not contradict those before it. Allah said,  تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ  (A revelation from the Lord of all that exists. ) meaning this Qur'an is a revelation from the Lord of all that exists, not as they say that it is magic, sorcery or poetry. Rather it is the truth, no doubt about it; there is none beyond it of useful truth. Allah's statement,  أَفَبِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَنتُمْ مُّدْهِنُونَ  (Is it such a talk that you are Mudhinun) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that Mudhinun means, \"You do not believe in and deny.\" Similar to this was said by Ad-Dahhak, Abu Hazrah and As-Suddi. Mujahid said,  مُّدْهِنُونَ  (Mudhinun) means \"You want to fill yourselves with and rely upon.\"  وَتَجْعَلُونَ رِزْقَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ  (And you make your provision your denial!) some of them said that provision here has the meaning of gratitude, meaning: you deny without any gratitude. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he recited it as: (وَتَجْعَلُونَ شُكْرَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ) (And your show of your gratitude by denying!) Ibn Jarir narrated from Muhammad bin Bashshar, who narrated from Muhammad bin Ja`far, who narrated from Shu`bah, from Abu Bishr, from Sa`id bin Jubayr who said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"It has never rained upon a people except that some of them became disbelievers by saying, `Such and such position of a star sent rain!\"' And Ibn `Abbas recited: (وَتَجْعَلُونَ شُكْرَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ) (And you show of your gratitude by denying.) This chain of narration is Sahih to Ibn `Abbas. In his Muwatta', Malik reported from Salih bin Kaysan, from `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah bin Mas`ud, from Zayd bin Khalid Al-Juhani who said, \"The Prophet led us in the Subh (dawn) prayer at Al-Hudaybiyah after a rainy night. On completion of the prayer, he faced the congregation and said,  «هَلْ تَدْرُونَ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ؟»  (Do you know what your Lord has said (revealed)) Those present replied, `Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said,  «قَالَ: أَصْبَحَ مِنْ عِبَادِي مُؤْمِنٌ بِي وَكَافِرٌ، فَأَمَّا مَنْ قَالَ: مُطِرْنَا بِفَضْلِ اللهِ وَرَحْمَتِهِ، فَذلِكَ مُؤْمِنٌ بِي، كَافِرٌ بِالْكَوْكَبِ، وَأَمَّا مَنْ قَالَ: مُطِرْنَا بِنَوْءِ كَذَا وَكَذَا، فَذلِكَ كَافِرٌ بِي وَمُؤْمِنٌ بِالْكَوْكَب»  (Allah has said, \"During this morning some of my servants remained as true believers in Me and some became disbelievers. Whoever said that the rain was due to the blessings and the mercy of Allah, had belief in Me, and he disbelieves in the stars; and whoever said that it rained because of a particular star, had no belief in Me, but believes in that star.\")\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i, all using a chain of narration in which Imam Malik was included. Qatadah said, \"Al-Hasan used to say, `How evil is that all that some people have earned for themselves from the Book of Allah, is denying it!\"' Al-Hasan's statement means that such people gained no benefit from the Book of Allah because they denied it, as Allah said:  أَفَبِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَنتُمْ مُّدْهِنُونَ - وَتَجْعَلُونَ رِزْقَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ  (Is it such a talk that you Mudhinun And you make your provision that you deny!)

  56,87,"<h2>When the Soul reaches the Throat at the Time of Death, it cannot be brought back; this proves Reckon</h2> Allah the Exalted said, ﴾فَلَوْلاَ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ﴿ (Then why do you not (intervene) when it reaches), in reference to the soul, ﴾الْحُلْقُومَ﴿ (Al-Hulqum), i.e., the throat, at the time of death. Allah the Exalted said in other Ayat, ﴾كَلاَّ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ - وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ - وَظَنَّ أَنَّهُ الْفِرَاقُ - وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ - إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمَسَاقُ ﴿ (Nay, when (the soul) reaches to the collar bone, and it will be said: \"Who can cure him (and save him from death)\" And he will conclude that it was (the time) of parting (death); And one leg will be joined with another leg (shrouded). The drive will be on that Day to your Lord (Allah).)(75:26-30) Allah said here, ﴾وَأَنتُمْ حِينَئِذٍ تَنظُرُونَ ﴿ (And you at the moment are looking,) at the dying person and witnessing the stupor of death that he is experiencing, ﴾وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنكُمْ﴿ (But We are nearer to him than you, ) with Our angels, ﴾وَلَـكِن لاَّ تُبْصِرُونَ﴿ (but you see not.) you cannot see the angels. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah, ﴾وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ وَيُرْسِلُ عَلَيْكُم حَفَظَةً حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَ أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ تَوَفَّتْهُ رُسُلُنَا وَهُمْ لاَ يُفَرِّطُونَ - ثُمَّ رُدُّواْ إِلَى اللَّهِ مَوْلَـهُمُ الْحَقِّ أَلاَ لَهُ الْحُكْمُ وَهُوَ أَسْرَعُ الْحَـسِبِينَ ﴿ (He is the Irresistible over His servants, and He sends guardians (angels) over you, until when death approaches one of you, Our messengers (angel of death and his assistants) take his soul, and they never neglect their duty. Then they are returned to Allah, their true Protector. Surely, for Him is the judgement and He is the swiftest in taking account.)(6:61-62) Allah's statement, ﴾فَلَوْلاَ إِن كُنتُمْ غَيْرَ مَدِينِينَ تَرْجِعُونَهَآ﴿ (Then why do you not -- if you are not Madinin -- return the soul,) means, `Will you not return this soul, that has reached the throat, to its body as it used to be, if you are exempt from the reckoning and recompense' Sa`id bin Jubayr and Al-Hasan Al-Basri said: ﴾فَلَوْلاَ إِن كُنتُمْ غَيْرَ مَدِينِينَ ﴿ (Then why do you not -- if you are not Madinin. ..), \"If you do not believe that you will be reckoned, recompensed, resurrected and punished, then why do you not return this soul to its body\" Mujahid said that, ﴾غَيْرَ مَدِينِينَ﴿ (...if you are not Madinin), means, \"if you are not certain.\" "

  56,96,"<h2>The Condition of People at the Time of Their Death</h2> These are the three types of conditions that people face upon their death. Either they are among the near believers or those below their rank on the right, or those who denied the truth, were led astray from the guidance and were ignorant about Allah. Allah said,  فَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ  (Then if he), in reference to the dying person,  مِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ  (be of the Muqarrabun) who fulfilled the obligations and the recommended acts of worship and avoided the forbidden and disliked matters and even some of the allowed,  فَرَوْحٌ وَرَيْحَانٌ وَجَنَّـتُ نَعِيمٍ  (then for him Rawh, Rayhan and a Garden of Delights.) Theirs will be Rawh and Rayhan; and the glad tidings of these traits will be conveyed to them by the angels at the time of death. We mentioned before the Prophet's Hadith narrated from Al-Bara' in which the angels of mercy say (to a dying, believing person),  «أَيَّتُهَا الرُّوحُ الطَّيِّبَةُ فِي الْجَسَدِ الطَّيِّبِ كُنْتِ تَعْمُرِينَه، اخْرُجِي إِلَى رَوْحٍ وَرَيْحَانٍ وَرَبَ غَيْرِ غَضْبَان»  (O good soul in the good body that you inhabited, come to Rawh, Rayhan and a Lord Who is not angry.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"Rawh means rest, and Rayhan means place of rest.\" Mujahid said similarly that Rawh means rest. Abu Hazrah said that Rawh means: \"Rest from the world.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr and As-Suddi said that it means to rejoice. And from Mujahid:  فَرَوْحٌ وَرَيْحَانٌ  (Rawh and Rayhan) means: \"Paradise and delights.\" Qatadah said that Rawh means mercy. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Rayhan means provisions. All of these explanations are correct and similar in meaning. The near believers who die will earn all of these; mercy, rest, provision, joy, happiness and good delights,  وَجَنَّـتُ نَعِيمٍ  (and a Garden of Delights.) Abu Al-`Aliyah said, \"None of the near believers will depart (this life) until after he is brought a branch of the Rayhan of Paradise and his soul is captured in it.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"Every person who dies will know upon his death if he is among the people of Paradise or the people of the Fire.\" In the Sahih, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِنَّ أَرْوَاحَ الشُّهَدَاءِ فِي حَوَاصِلِ طُيُورٍ خُضْرٍ، تَسْرَحُ فِي رِيَاضِ الْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ شَاءَتْ، ثُمَّ تَأْوِي إِلَى قَنَادِيلَ مُعَلَّقَةٍ بِالْعَرْش»  (The souls of the martyrs live in the bodies of green birds flying wherever they wish in the Gardens of Paradise, and then rest to their nests in chandeliers hung from the Throne of the Almighty....) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ata' bin As-Sa'ib said, \"The first day I saw `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Layla, I saw an old man whose hair had become white on his head and beard. He was riding his donkey and following a funeral. I heard him say, `So-and-so narrated to me that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,  «مَنْ أَحَبَّ لِقَاءَ اللهِ أَحَبَّ اللهُ لِقَاءَهُ، وَمَنْ كَرِهَ لِقَاءَ اللهِ كَرِهَ اللهُ لِقَاءَه»  (He who likes to meet Allah, Allah likes to meet him, and he who hates to meet Allah, Allah hates to meet him.) The people around him started weeping, and he asked them why they wept. They said, `All of us hate death.' He said,  «لَيْسَ ذَاكَ، وَلكِنَّهُ إِذَا احْتُضِرَ  فَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ - فَرَوْحٌ وَرَيْحَانٌ وَجَنَّـتُ نَعِيمٍ  فَإِذَا بُشِّرَ بِذلِكَ أَحَبَّ لِقَاءَ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ، وَاللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ لِلِقَائِهِ أَحَبُّ  وَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ الضَّآلِّينَ - فَنُزُلٌ مِّنْ حَمِيمٍ - وَتَصْلِيَةُ جَحِيمٍ  فَإذَا بُشِّرَ بِذلِكَ كَرِهَ لِقَاءَ اللهِ،وَاللهُ تَعَالَى لِلِقَائِهِ أَكْرَه»  (It does not mean that. When one dies: (Then, if he be of the near believers, then for him are Rawh, Rayhan, and a Garden of Delights.)( and when this good news is conveyed to him, he likes to meet Allah the Exalted and Most Honored and Allah the Exalted and Most Honored likes, even more, to meet him, (But if he be of the denying, the erring, then for him is an entertainment with Hamim. And entry in Hellfire.)( and when this news is conveyed to him, he hates to meet Allah and Allah hates, even more, to meet him.)\" This is the narration that Imam Ahmad collected; and in the Sahih, there is a Hadith with this meaning collected from `A'ishah. Allah's statement,  وَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ مِنْ أَصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ  (And if he be of those on the right,) means, if he, the dying person, is among those on the right,  فَسَلَـمٌ لَّكَ مِنْ أَصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ  (Then Salam (peace) to you from those on the right) meaning, the angels will deliver the good news to them by saying, \"Peace be upon you,\" i.e., be calm, you will be led to safety, you are among those on the right, as `Ikrimah said, \"The angels will greet him with the Salam and convey to him the news that he is among those on the right. \" This is a good explanation, and it conforms with Allah's statement,  إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ أَلاَّ تَخَافُواْ وَلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ وَأَبْشِرُواْ بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ - نَحْنُ أَوْلِيَآؤُكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِى أَنفُسُكُمْ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَدَّعُونَ - نُزُلاً مِّنْ غَفُورٍ رَّحِيمٍ  (Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is Allah.\" and then they stand firm, on them the angles will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): \"Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised! We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have (all) that your souls desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask. An entertainment from the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\") (41:30-32). Allah's statement,  وَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ الضَّآلِّينَ - فَنُزُلٌ مِّنْ حَمِيمٍ - وَتَصْلِيَةُ جَحِيمٍ  (But if he be of the denying, the erring, then for him is an entertainment with Hamim (boiling water) and entry in Hellfire.) meaning, if the dying person is one of those who denied the truth, who were led astray from guidance,  فَنُزُلٌ  (then for him is an entertainment,) meaning, as a guest  مِنْ حَمِيمٍ  (with Hamim) that dissolves his intestines and skin,  وَتَصْلِيَةُ جَحِيمٍ  (And entry in Hellfire.) he will reside in Hellfire, which will engulf him from every direction. Allah the Exalted said, next,  إِنَّ هَـذَا لَهُوَ حَقُّ الْيَقِينِ  (Verily, this! This is an absolute truth with certainty.) meaning, this news is the truth; there is no doubt about it, nor escape from it for anyone,  فَسَبِّحْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الْعَظِيمِ  (So, glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.) Jabir narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «مَنْ قَالَ: سُبْحَانَ اللهِ الْعَظِيمِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ، غُرِسَتْ لَهُ نَخْلَةٌ فِي الْجَنَّة»  (He who says, \"Glory be to Allah the Magnificent and with His praise!\" then a date tree will be planted for him in Paradise.) This Hadith was collected by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i; At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Gharib.\" Al-Bukhari recorded in his book (Sahih) that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «كَلِمَتَانِ خَفِيفَتَانِ عَلَى اللِّسَانِ، ثَقِيلَتَانِ فِي الْمِيزَانِ، حَبِيبَتَانِ إِلَى الرَّحْمنِ: سُبْحَانَ اللهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ، سُبْحَانَ اللهِ الْعَظِيم»  ((There are) two statements that are light on the tongue, but heavy on the Balance, and most beloved to Ar-Rahman: \"Glory be to Allah and with His praise, glory be to Allah the Magnificent.\") The Group, with the exception of Abu Dawud, collected this. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Waqi`ah, all praise and thanks are due to Allah and all the favors come from Him. "

  57,3,"<h2>Which was revealed in Madina</h2><h2>The Virtues of Surat Al-Hadid</h2> Imam Ahmad recorded that `Irbad bin Sariyah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to recite Al-Musabbihat before he went to sleep, saying,  «إِنَّ فِيهِنَّ آيَةً أَفْضَلُ مِنْ أَلْفِ آيَة»  (In them there is an Ayah that is better than a thousand Ayat.) Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith; At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Gharib.\" The Ayah referred to in this Hadith is -- and Allah knows best --  هُوَ الاٌّوَّلُ وَالاٌّخِرُ وَالظَّـهِرُ وَالْبَـطِنُ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ  (He is Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir, Az-Zahir and Al-Batin. And He is the All-Knower of everything.)(57:3) Allah willing, we will again mention this subject. Upon Allah we trust and our total reliance and dependence are on Him, and sufficient He is to us as Supporter and Helper.  بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ  In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. <h2>Everything that exists glorifies Allah and mentioning some of His Attributes</h2> In this Ayah, Allah states that everything that exists in the heavens and earth praises and glorifies Him, including creatures and plants. Allah said in another Ayah,  تُسَبِّحُ لَهُ السَّمَـوَتُ السَّبْعُ وَالاٌّرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ وَإِن مِّن شَىْءٍ إِلاَّ يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدَهِ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تَفْقَهُونَ تَسْبِيحَهُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ حَلِيمًا غَفُورًا  (The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise. But you understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.)(17:44) And His saying:  وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ  (and He is the Almighty,) meaning the One to Whom all things submit humility,  الْحَكِيمُ  (All-Wise.) in His creating, commanding and legislating,  لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ يُحْىِ وَيُمِيتُ  (His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. It is He Who gives life and causes death;) He is the absolute Owner of His creation, bringing life and death and granting what He wills to whom He wills,  وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ  (and He is Able to do all things.) whatever He wills, is, and whatever He does not will, will never be. He said,  هُوَ الاٌّوَّلُ وَالاٌّخِرُ وَالظَّـهِرُ وَالْبَـطِنُ  (He is Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir, Az-Zahir and Al-Batin.) This is the Ayah indicated in the Hadith of `Irbad bin Sariyah that is better than a thousand Ayat. Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Zamil said, \"I mentioned to Ibn `Abbas that I felt something in my heart. He said, `Doubts' and then laughed. Next, he said, `No one can escape this. Allah the Exalted stated,  فَإِن كُنتَ فِي شَكٍّ مِّمَّآ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ فَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ يَقْرَءُونَ الْكِتَـبَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَقَدْ جَآءَكَ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ  (So if you are in doubt concerning that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who are reading the Book before you. Verily, the truth has come to you from your Lord.)(10:94)' He then said to me, `When you feel any of this in your heart, recite,  هُوَ الاٌّوَّلُ وَالاٌّخِرُ وَالظَّـهِرُ وَالْبَـطِنُ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ  (He is Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir, Az-Zahir and Al-Batin. And He is the All-Knower of everything.)\"' There are about ten and some odd number of different sayings collected from the scholars of Tafsir regarding the explanation of this Ayah. Al-Bukhari said, \"Yahya said, `Az-Zahir: knowing all things, Al-Batin: knowing all things.\"' Our Shaykh Al-Hafiz Al-Mizzi said, \"Yahya is Ibn Ziyad Al-Farra', who authored a book entitled Ma`ani Al-Qur'an.\" There are Hadiths mentioned about this. Among them, Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would recite this supplication while going to bed,  «اللْهُمَّ رَبَّ السَّموَاتِ السَّبْعِ، وَرَبَّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ، رَبَّنَا وَرَبَّ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ، مُنْزِلَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَالْإِنْجِيلِ وَالْفُرْقَانِ، فَالِقَ الْحَبِّ وَالنَّوَى، لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ، أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ أَنْتَ آخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهِ، أَنْتَ الْأَوَّلُ لَيْسَ قَبْلَكَ شَيْءٌ، وَأَنْتَ الْاخِرُ لَيْسَ بَعْدَكَ شَيْءٌ، وَأَنْتَ الظَّاهِرُ لَيْسَ فَوْقَكَ شَيْءٌ، وَأَنْتَ الْبَاطِنُ لَيْسَ دُونَكَ شَيْءٌ. اقْضِ عَنَّا الدَّيْنَ، وَأَغْنِنَا مِنَ الْفَقْر»  (O Allah, Lord of the seven heavens and Lord of the Magnificent Throne! Our Lord, and the Lord of everything, Revealer of the Tawrah, the Injil and the Furqan, the Splitter of the grain of corn and the date stone! I seek refuge with You from the evil of everything whose forhead You have control over. O Allah! You are Al-Awwal, nothing is before You; Al-Akhir, nothing is after You; Az-Zahir, nothing is above You; and Al-Batin, nothing is below You. Remove the burden of debt from us and free us from poverty.) Muslim recorded this Hadith via Sahl, who said, \"Abu Salih used to order us to lay on our right side when we were about to sleep, and then say,  «اللْهُمَّ رَبَّ السَّموَاتِ وَرَبَّ الْأَرْضِ وَرَبَّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ، رَبَّنَا وَرَبَّ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ، فَالِقَ الْحَبِّ وَالنَّوَى، وَمُنْزِلَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَالْإِنْجِيلِ وَالْفُرْقَانِ، أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ ذِي شَرَ أَنْتَ آخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهِ، اللْهُمَّ أَنْتَ الْأَوَّلُ فَلَيْسَ قَبْلَكَ شَيْءٌ، وَأَنْتَ الْاخِرُ فَلَيْسَ بَعْدَكَ شَيْءٌ، وَأَنْتَ الظَّاهِرُ فَلَيْسَ فَوْقَكَ شَيْءٌ، وَأَنْتَ الْبَاطِنُ فَلَيْسَ دُونَكَ شَيْءٌ، اقْضِ عَنَّا الدَّيْنَ، وَأَغْنِنَا مِنَ الْفَقْر»  (O Allah, Lord of the seven heavens and Lord of the Magnificent Throne! Our Lord, and the Lord of everything, Revealer of the Tawrah, the Injil and the Furqan, the Splitter of the grain of corn and the date stone! I seek refuge with You from the evil of everything whose forhead You have control over. O Allah! You are Al-Awwal, nothing is before You; Al-Akhir, nothing is after You; Az-Zahir, nothing is above You; and Al-Batin, nothing is below You. Remove the burden of debt from us and free us from poverty.) And he used to narrate that from Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet .\" "
