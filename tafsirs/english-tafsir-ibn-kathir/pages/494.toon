  43,65,"<h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2> Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:  وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ  (And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,  إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ  (Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad ﷺ claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad ﷺ whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:  «كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»  (Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:  إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ  (Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:  وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ  (And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:  وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ  (And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:  إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ  (He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.  فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ  (Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:  وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ  (And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:  إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ  (Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:  «ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»  (He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:  مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ  (They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"  وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ  (And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad ﷺ.  مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ  (They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,  إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ  (Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»  g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah:  مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ  (They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"  إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ  (He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.  وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ  (and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'  وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ  (And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:  وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ  (And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:  وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ  (And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --  وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً  And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:  وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ  (And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.  فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا  (Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.  وَاتَّبِعُونِ  (And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'  هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ  (This is the straight path. And let not Shaytan hinder you.) means, from following the truth.  إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌوَلَمَّا جَآءَ عِيسَى بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ قَالَ قَدْ جِئْتُكُم بِالْحِكْمَةِ  (Verily, he (Satan) to you is a plain enemy. And when `Isa came with (Our) clear proofs, he said: \"I have come to you with Al-Hikmah...\"), meaning prophethood:  وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ  (and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ.) Ibn Jarir said, \"This means religious matters, not worldly matters.\" What he said is good.  فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ  (Therefore have Taqwa of Allah) means, `with regard to what I command you to do.'  وَأَطِيعُونِ  (and obey me.) means, `in what I bring to you.'  إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ  (Verily, Allah! He is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is the straight path.) means, `you and I are enslaved to Him, in need of Him and we commonly share in the worship of Him Alone, associating none with Him.'  هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ  (This is the straight path) means, `what I have brought to you is the straight path, which is the worship of the Lord, may He exalted, Alone.'  فَاخْتَلَفَ الاٌّحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ  (But the sects from among themselves differed. ) means, they differed and became parties and factions, some who stated that he (`Isa) was the servant and Messenger of Allah -- which is true - while others claimed that he was the son of Allah or that he himself was Allah -- glorified be Allah far above what they say. Allah says:  فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ  (So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)! "

  43,73,"<h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2> Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait' ﴾إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ﴿ (only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection. ﴾الاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ ﴿ (Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people: ﴾إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ﴿ (You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25) <h2>Good News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise</h2>﴾يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُوَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ﴿ (My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) Then He will give them the glad tidings: ﴾الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ ﴿ ((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) means, their hearts believed and they submitted inwardly and outwardly to the Laws of Allah. Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: \"When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out: ﴾يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ ﴿ (My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words: ﴾الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ ﴿ ((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers.\" ﴾ادْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ﴿ (Enter Paradise, ) means, they will be told to enter Paradise. ﴾أَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَجُكُمْ﴿ (you and your wives,) means, your counterparts ﴾تُحْبَرُونَ﴿ (in happiness (Tuhbarun).) means, in delight and joy. ﴾يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِصِحَـفٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَبٍ﴿ (Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;) means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. (وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِي الْأَنْفُسُ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited: ﴾مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ﴿ (that their souls desire,) ﴾وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ﴿ (and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes. ﴾وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا﴿ (and you will therein) means, in Paradise ﴾خَـلِدُونَ﴿ (abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah: ﴾وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ ﴿ (This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds. ﴾لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ﴿ (Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds. ﴾مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ﴿ (of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best. "
