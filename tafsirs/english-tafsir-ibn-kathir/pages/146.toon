  6,138,"<h2>The Idolators Forbade Certain Types of Cattle</h2> `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Hijr refers to what they forbade, such as the Wasilah, and the like.\" Similar was said by Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Qatadah, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and others. Qatadah commented on,  ﴾وَقَالُواْ هَـذِهِ أَنْعَـمٌ وَحَرْثٌ حِجْرٌ﴿ (They say that such and such cattle and crops are Hijr,) \"It is a prohibition that the Shayatin appointed for their wealth, and a type of exaggeration and extremism that did not come from Allah.\" `Abdur-Rahman Ibn Zayd bin Aslam said that, d  ﴾حِجْرٍ﴿ (Hijr,) refers to what the idolators designated for their deities. As-Suddi said that the Ayah,  ﴾لاَّ يَطْعَمُهَآ إِلاَّ مَن نَّشَآءُ بِزَعْمِهِمْ﴿ (And none should eat of them except those whom we allow, they claimed...) means, \"They said, only those whom we choose can eat of them., and the rest are prohibited from eating them.\" Similar to this honorable Ayah, Allah said,  ﴾قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ مَّآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ مِّن رِّزْقٍ فَجَعَلْتُمْ مِّنْهُ حَرَامًا وَحَلاَلاً قُلْ ءَآللَّهُ أَذِنَ لَكُمْ أَمْ عَلَى اللَّهِ تَفْتَرُونَ ﴿ (Say: \"Tell me, what provision Allah has sent down to you! And you have made of it lawful and unlawful.\" Say: \"Has Allah permitted you (to do so), or do you invent a lie against Allah\") 10:59, and,  ﴾مَا جَعَلَ اللَّهُ مِن بَحِيرَةٍ وَلاَ سَآئِبَةٍ وَلاَ وَصِيلَةٍ وَلاَ حَامٍ وَلَـكِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ وَأَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ ﴿ (Allah has not instituted things like Bahirah or a Sa'ibah or a Wasilah or a Ham. But those who disbelieve invent lies against Allah, and most of them have no understanding.) 5:103 As-Suddi said that cattle forbidden to be used for burden were the Bahirah, Sa'ibah, Wasilah and Ham, as well as cattle for which the idolators did not mention Allah's Name when slaughtering them nor when they were born. Abu Bakr bin `Ayyash said that `Asim bin Abi An-Najud said, \"Abu Wa'il said to me, `Do you know the meaning of the Ayah,  ﴾وَأَنْعَـمٌ حُرِّمَتْ ظُهُورُهَا وَأَنْعَـمٌ لاَّ يَذْكُرُونَ اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَا﴿ (And (they say) there are cattle forbidden to be used for burden, and cattle on which the Name of Allah is not pronounced.) I said, `No.' He said, `It is the Bahirah, which they would not use to for Hajj (either by riding it or carrying things on it).\"' Mujahid also said that they were some of the camels belonging to idolators on which Allah's Name was not mentioned when riding, milking, carrying things, copulation or any other action.  ﴾افْتِرَآءً عَلَيْهِ﴿ (lying against Him.) against Allah. The idolators indeed lied when they attributed this evil to Allah's religion and Law; He did not allow them to do that nor did He approve of it,  ﴾سَيَجْزِيهِم بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ﴿ (He will recompense them for what they used to fabricate.) against Him, and falsely attribute to Him.  "
  6,139,"﴾وَقَالُواْ مَا فِى بُطُونِ هَـذِهِ الأَنْعَـمِ خَالِصَةٌ لِّذُكُورِنَا﴿ (And they say: \"What is in the bellies of such and such cattle is for our males alone...\") refers to milk. `Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said about this Ayah,  ﴾وَقَالُواْ مَا فِى بُطُونِ هَـذِهِ الأَنْعَـمِ خَالِصَةٌ لِّذُكُورِنَا﴿ (And they say: \"What is in the bellies of such and such cattle is for our males alone...\") \"It is about milk, which they prohibited for their females and allowed only their males to drink. When a sheep would give birth to a male sheep, they would slaughter it and feed it to their males, but not to their females. If the newly born lamb was a female, they would not slaughter it, but if it was stillborn, they would share in it (with their females)! Allah forbade this practice.\" Similar was said by As-Suddi. Ash-Sha`bi said, \"The Bahirah's milk was only given to the men. But if any cattle from the Bahirah died, both men and women would share in eating it.\" Similar was said by `Ikrimah, Qatadah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. Mujahid commented;  ﴾وَقَالُواْ مَا فِى بُطُونِ هَـذِهِ الأَنْعَـمِ خَالِصَةٌ لِّذُكُورِنَا وَمُحَرَّمٌ عَلَى أَزْوَجِنَا﴿ (And they say: \"What is in the bellies of such and such cattle is for our males alone, and forbidden to our females...\") \"It refers to the Sa'ibah and the Bahirah.\" Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid and Qatadah said that Allah's statement,  ﴾سَيَجْزِيهِمْ وَصْفَهُمْ﴿ (He will punish them for their attribution. ) means, uttering such falsehood. This is explained by Allah's statement,  ﴾وَلاَ تَقُولُواْ لِمَا تَصِفُ أَلْسِنَتُكُمُ الْكَذِبَ هَـذَا حَلَـلٌ وَهَـذَا حَرَامٌ لِّتَفْتَرُواْ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ لاَ يُفْلِحُونَ ﴿ (And say not concerning that which your tongues falsely utter: \"This is lawful and this is forbidden.\" so as to invent lies against Allah. Verily, those who invent lies against Allah will never prosper.) 16:116 Allah said,  ﴾إِنَّهُ حَكِيمٌ﴿ (Verily, He is All-Wise.) in His actions, statements, Law and decree,  ﴾عَلِيمٌ﴿ (All-Knower), in the actions of His servants, whether good or evil, and He will recompense them for these deeds completely.  "
  6,140,"<h2>Allah says that those who committed these evil acts have earned the loss of this life and the Hereafter.</h2>As for this life, they lost when they killed their children and made it difficult for themselves by prohibiting some types of their wealth, as an act of innovation that they invented on their own. As for the Hereafter, they will end up in the worst dwellings, because they used to lie about Allah and invent falsehood about Him. Allah also said,﴾قُلْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ لاَ يُفْلِحُونَ - مَتَـعٌ فِى الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ نُذِيقُهُمُ الْعَذَابَ الشَّدِيدَ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ ﴿ (Say: \"Verily, those who invent a lie against Allah will never be successful.\" (A brief) enjoyment in this world! And then unto Us will be their return, then We shall make them taste the severest torment because they used to disbelieve.) 10:69-70 Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented, \"If it pleases you to know how ignorant the Arabs used to be, then recite the Ayat beyond Ayah one hundred and thirty in Surat Al-An`am,  ﴾قَدْ خَسِرَ الَّذِينَ قَتَلُواْ أَوْلَـدَهُمْ سَفَهاً بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَحَرَّمُواْ مَا رَزَقَهُمُ اللَّهُ افْتِرَآءً عَلَى اللَّهِ قَدْ ضَلُّواْ وَمَا كَانُواْ مُهْتَدِينَ ﴿ (Indeed lost are they who have killed their children, foolishly, without knowledge, and they have forbidden that which Allah has provided for them, inventing a lie against Allah. They have indeed gone astray and were not guided.)\" Al-Bukhari also recorded this in the section of his Sahih on the virtues of the Quraysh.  "

  6,142,"<h2>Allah Created the Produce, Seed Grains and Cattle</h2> Allah states that He created everything, including the produce, fruits and cattle that the idolators mishandled by their misguided ideas, dividing them into various designated parts, allowing some and prohibiting some. Allah said,  ﴾وَهُوَ الَّذِى أَنشَأَ جَنَّـتٍ مَّعْرُوشَـتٍ وَغَيْرَ مَعْرُوشَـتٍ﴿ (And it is He Who produces gardens Ma`rushat and not Ma`rushat,) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented, \"Ma`rushat refers to what the people trellise, while `not Ma`rushat' refers to fruits (and produce) that grow wild inland and on mountains.\" `Ata' Al-Khurasani said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Ma`rushat are the grapevines that are trellised, while `not Ma`rushat' refers to grapevines that are not trellised.\" As-Suddi said similarly. As for these fruits being similar, yet different, Ibn Jurayj said, \"They are similar in shape, but different in taste.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b said that the Ayah,  ﴾كُلُواْ مِن ثَمَرِهِ إِذَآ أَثْمَرَ﴿ (Eat of their fruit when they ripen,) means, \"(Eat) from the dates and grapes they produce.\" Allah said next,  ﴾وَءَاتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ﴿ (but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest, ) Mujahid commented, \"When the poor people are present (on the day of harvest), give them some of the produce.\" `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Mujahid commented on the Ayah,  ﴾وَءَاتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ﴿ (but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest.) \"When planting, one gives away handfuls (of seed grains) and on harvest, he gives away handfuls and allows them to pick whatever is left on the ground of the harvest.\" Ath-Thawri said that Hammad narrated that Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"One gives away some of the hay.\" Ibn Al-Mubarak said that Shurayk said that Salim said that Sa`id bin Jubayr commented;  ﴾وَءَاتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ﴿ (but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest,) \"This ruling, giving the poor the handfuls (of seed grains) and some of the hay as food for their animals, was before Zakah became obligatory.\" Allah has chastised those who harvest, without giving away a part of it as charity. Allah mentioned the story of the owners of the garden in Surat Nun,  ﴾إِنَّا بَلَوْنَـهُمْ كَمَا بَلَوْنَآ أَصْحَـبَ الْجَنَّةِ إِذْ أَقْسَمُواْ لَيَصْرِمُنَّهَا مُصْبِحِينَ - وَلاَ يَسْتَثْنُونَ - فَطَافَ عَلَيْهَا طَآئِفٌ مِّن رَّبِّكَ وَهُمْ نَآئِمُونَ - فَأَصْبَحَتْ كَالصَّرِيمِ - فَتَنَادَوْاْ مُصْبِحِينَ - أَنِ اغْدُواْ عَلَى حَرْثِكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـرِمِينَ - فَانطَلَقُواْ وَهُمْ يَتَخَـفَتُونَ - أَن لاَّ يَدْخُلَنَّهَا الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّسْكِينٌ - وَغَدَوْاْ عَلَى حَرْدٍ قَـدِرِينَ - فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهَا قَالُواْ إِنَّا لَضَآلُّونَ بَلْ نَحْنُ مَحْرُومُونَ قَالَ أَوْسَطُهُمْ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَّكُمْ لَوْلاَ تُسَبِّحُونَ قَالُواْ سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَـلِمِينَ فَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ يَتَلَـوَمُونَ قَالُواْ يوَيْلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا طَـغِينَ عَسَى رَبُّنَآ أَن يُبْدِلَنَا خَيْراً مِّنْهَآ إِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا رَغِبُونَ كَذَلِكَ الْعَذَابُ وَلَعَذَابُ الاٌّخِرَةِ أَكْبَرُ لَوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ ﴿ (When they swore to pluck the fruits of the (garden) in the morning. Without saying: \"If Allah wills.\" Then there passed by on the (garden) a visitation (fire) from your Lord at night, burning it while they were asleep. So the (garden) became black by the morning, like a pitch dark night (in complete ruins). Then they called out one to another as soon as the morning broke. Saying: \"Go to your tilth in the morning, if you would pluck the fruits.\" So they departed, conversing in secret low tones (saying). \"No poor person shall enter upon you into it today.\" And they went in the morning with strong intention, thinking that they have power (to prevent the poor taking anything of the fruits therefrom). But when they saw the (garden), they said: \"Verily, we have gone astray.\" (Then they said): \"Nay! Indeed we are deprived of (the fruits)!\" The best among them said: \"Did I not tell you, why say you not: `If Allah wills'.\" They said: \"Glory to Our Lord! Verily, we have been wrongdoers.\" Then they turned one against another, blaming. They said: \"Woe to us! We have transgressed. We hope that our Lord will give us in exchange a better (garden) than this. Truly, we turn to our Lord.\" Such is the punishment (in this life), but truly, the punishment of the Hereafter is greater if they but knew.) 68:18-33.  <h2>Prohibiting Extravagance</h2> Allah said,  ﴾وَلاَ تُسْرِفُواْ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْمُسْرِفِينَ﴿ (And waste not by extravagance. Verily, He likes not the wasteful.) It was said that the extravagance prohibited here refers to excessive charity beyond normal amounts. Ibn Jurayj said, \"This Ayah was revealed concerning Thabit bin Qays bin Shammas, who plucked the fruits of his date palms. Then he said to himself, `This day, every person who comes to me, I will feed him from it.' So he kept feeding (them) until the evening came and he ended up with no dates. Allah sent down,  ﴾وَلاَ تُسْرِفُواْ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْمُسْرِفِينَ﴿ (And waste not by extravagance. Verily, He likes not the wasteful.)\" Ibn Jarir recorded this statement from Ibn Jurayj. However, thhe apparent meaning of this Ayah, and Allah knows best, is that;  ﴾كُلُواْ مِن ثَمَرِهِ إِذَآ أَثْمَرَ وَءَاتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ وَلاَ تُسْرِفُواْ﴿ (Eat of their fruit when they ripen, but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest, and waste not...) refers to eating, meaning, do not waste in eating because this spoils the mind and the body. Allah said in another Ayah,  ﴾وكُلُواْ وَاشْرَبُواْ وَلاَ تُسْرِفُواْ﴿ (And eat and drink but waste not by extravagance.) 7: 31 In his Sahih, Al-Bukhari recorded a Hadith without a chain of narration; a  ﴾«كُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا وَالْبَسُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ إِسْرَافٍ وَلَا مَخِيلَة»﴿ (Eat, drink and clothe yourselves without extravagance or arrogance.) Therefore, these Ayat have the same meaning as this Hadith. and Allah knows best.  <h2>Benefits of Cattle</h2> Allah's statement,  ﴾وَمِنَ الأَنْعَـمِ حَمُولَةً وَفَرْشًا﴿ (And of the cattle (are some) for burden and (some smaller) for Farsh.) means, He created cattle for you, some of which are suitable for burden, such as camels, and some are Farsh. Ath-Thawri narrated that Abu Ishaq said that Abu Al-Ahwas said that `Abdullah said that `animals for burden' are the camels that are used for carrying things, while, `Farsh', refers to small camels. Al-Hakim recorded it and said, \"Its chain is Sahih and they did not record it.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that `animals for burden' refers to the animals that people ride, while, `Farsh' is that they eat (its meat) and milk it. The sheep is not able to carry things, so you eat its meat and use its wool for covers and mats (or clothes). This statement of `Abdur-Rahman is sound, and the following Ayat testify to it,  ﴾أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَا لَهُم مِمَّا عَمِلَتْ أَيْدِينَآ أَنْعـماً فَهُمْ لَهَا مَـلِكُونَ - وَذَلَّلْنَـهَا لَهُمْ فَمِنْهَا رَكُوبُهُمْ وَمِنْهَا يَأْكُلُونَ ﴿ (Do they not see that We have created for them of what Our Hands have created, the cattle, so that they are their owners. And We have subdued them unto them so that some of them they have for riding and some they eat.) 36:71-72, and,  ﴾وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ فِى الاٌّنْعَـمِ لَعِبْرَةً نُّسْقِيكُمْ مِّمَّا فِى بُطُونِهِ مِن بَيْنِ فَرْثٍ وَدَمٍ لَّبَنًا خَالِصًا سَآئِغًا لِلشَّارِبِينَ ﴿ (And verily, in the cattle, there is a lesson for you. We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies, from between excretions and blood, pure milk; palatable to the drinkers.) 16:66, until,  ﴾وَمِنْ أَصْوَافِهَا وَأَوْبَارِهَا وَأَشْعَارِهَآ أَثَـثاً وَمَتَـعاً إِلَى حِينٍ﴿ (And of their wool, fur and hair, furnishings and articles of convenience, comfort for a while.) 16:80.  <h2>Eat the Meat of These Cattle, But Do Not Follow Shaytan's Law Concerning Them</h2> Allah said,  ﴾كُلُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ اللَّهُ﴿ (Eat of what Allah has provided for you,) of fruits, produce and cattle. Allah created all these and provided you with them as provision.  ﴾وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ خُطُوَتِ الشَّيْطَـنِ﴿ (and follow not the footsteps of Shaytan.) meaning, his way and orders, just as the idolators followed him and prohibited fruits and produce that Allah provided for them, claiming that this falsehood came from Allah.  ﴾إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ﴿ (Surely, he is to you) meaning; Shaytan, O people, is to you,  ﴾عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ﴿ (an open enemy) and his enmity to you is clear and apparent. Allah said in other Ayat,  ﴾إِنَّ الشَّيْطَـنَ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ فَاتَّخِذُوهُ عَدُوّاً إِنَّمَا يَدْعُو حِزْبَهُ لِيَكُونُواْ مِنْ أَصْحَـبِ السَّعِيرِ ﴿ (Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy. He only invites his Hizb (followers) that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire. ) 35:6 and,  ﴾يَـبَنِى آدَمَ لاَ يَفْتِنَنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ كَمَآ أَخْرَجَ أَبَوَيْكُم مِّنَ الْجَنَّةِ يَنزِعُ عَنْهُمَا لِبَاسَهُمَا لِيُرِيَهُمَا سَوْءَتِهِمَآ﴿ (O Children of Adam! Let not Shaytan deceive you, as he got your parents out of Paradise, stripping them of their raiment, to show them their private parts.) 7:27 and,  ﴾أَفَتَتَّخِذُونَهُ وَذُرِّيَّتَهُ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِى وَهُمْ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ بِئْسَ لِلظَّـلِمِينَ بَدَلاً﴿ (Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you What an evil is the exchange for the wrongdoers.)18:50 There are many other Ayat on this subject.  "
