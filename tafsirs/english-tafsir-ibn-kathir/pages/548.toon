tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  59,17,"<h2>The False Promise of Support the Hypocrites gave to the Jews</h2> Allah states that the hypocrites, `Abdullah bin Ubayy and his like, sent a messenger to Bani An-Nadir promising them help. Allah the Exalted said, ﴾أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ نَـفَقُواْ يَقُولُونَ لإِخْوَانِهِمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ لَئِنْ أُخْرِجْتُمْ لَنَخْرُجَنَّ مَعَكُمْ وَلاَ نُطِيعُ فيكُمْ أَحَداً أَبَداً وَإِن قُوتِلْتُمْ لَنَنصُرَنَّكُمْ﴿ (Have you not observed the hypocrites who say to their friends among the People of the Scripture who disbelieve: \"If you are expelled, we indeed will go out with you, and we shall never obey anyone against you; and if you are attacked, we shall indeed help you.\") Allah then said, ﴾وَاللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ﴿ (But Allah is Witness that they verily are liars.) meaning, the hypocrites lied when they issued this promise, because it was just words that they did not intend to fulfill. Also, what they said they would do, would never have been fulfilled by them, and this is why Allah said, ﴾وَلَئِن قُوتِلُواْ لاَ يَنصُرُونَهُمْ﴿ (and if they are attacked, they will never help them.) meaning, the hypocrites will not fight along with the Jews, ﴾وَلَئِن نَّصَرُوهُمْ﴿ (And (even) if they do help them, ) and even if the hypocrites did fight along their side, ﴾لَيُوَلُّنَّ الاٌّدْبَـرَ ثُمَّ لاَ يُنصَرُونَ﴿ (they will turn their backs, and they will not be victorious.) This Ayah contains good news, just as the good news that this following Ayah conveys, ﴾لاّنتُمْ أَشَدُّ رَهْبَةً فِى صُدُورِهِمْ مِّنَ اللَّهِ﴿ (Verily, you are more fearful in their breasts than Allah.) meaning, the hypocrites fear you more than they fear Allah, as He says; ﴾إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً﴿ (Behold! a section of them fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77)  This is why Allah said, ﴾ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يَفْقَهُونَ﴿ (That is because they are a people who comprehend not.) Allah then said, ﴾لاَ يُقَـتِلُونَكُمْ جَمِيعاً إِلاَّ فِى قُرًى مُّحَصَّنَةٍ أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ جُدُرٍ﴿ (They fight not against you even together, except in fortified townships, or from behind walls.) meaning, they will not fight Muslims except from behind besieged fortified forts, because of their cowardice and fear of Muslims. They only fight when they have to defend themselves (even though they threaten Muslims of reprisals). Allah the Exalted said, ﴾بَأْسُهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ شَدِيدٌ﴿ (Their enmity among themselves is very great.) meaning, the enmity they feel against each other is intense, ﴾وَيُذِيقَ بَعْضَكُمْ بَأْسَ بَعْضٍ﴿ (And make you to taste the violence of one another.)(6:65) Allah said in the Ayah, ﴾تَحْسَبُهُمْ جَمِيعاً وَقُلُوبُهُمْ شَتَّى﴿ (You would think they were united, but their hearts are divided.) meaning, even though one might see them combining forces and think that these forces are harmonious, yet in reality, they are divided severely. Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said that this Ayah refers to the hypocrites and the People of the Scriptures, ﴾ذلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يَعْقِلُونَ﴿ (That is because they are a people who understand not.) Allah said, ﴾كَمَثَلِ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ قَرِيباً ذَاقُواْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ ﴿ (They are like their immediate predecessors; they tasted the evil result of their conduct, and for them a painful torment.) referring to the Jewish tribe of Bani Qaynuqa`, according to Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and Muhammad bin Ishaq. <h2>The Parable of the Hypocrites and the Jews</h2> Allah said, ﴾كَمَثَلِ الشَّيْطَـنِ إِذْ قَالَ لِلإِنسَـنِ اكْفُرْ فَلَمَّا كَفَرَ قَالَ إِنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّنكَ﴿ (Like Shaytan, when he says to man: \"Disbelieve.\" But when (man) disbelieves, Shaytan says: \"I am free of you...\") meaning, the example of the Jews being deceived by the promises of the hypocrites, who said that they will help them if Muslims fight them, is that of the devil. When matters got serious and the Jews were besieged, the hypocrites betrayed them and abandoned them to taste utter defeat. Likewise, the devil lures mankind into disbelief and when they obey him, he disowns them and declares himself free of their actions, saying, ﴾إِنِّى أَخَافُ اللَّهَ رَبَّ الْعَـلَمِينَ﴿ (I fear Allah, the Lord of all that exists!) Allah said, ﴾فَكَانَ عَـقِبَتَهُمَآ أَنَّهُمَا فِى النَّارِ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا﴿ (So, the end of both will be that they will be in the Fire, abiding therein.) meaning, the end of both he, Shaytan, who commanded that dis- belief be committed, and those who accep- ted his call, was in the fire of Hell forever, ﴾وَذَلِكَ جَزَآءُ الظَّـلِمِينَ﴿ (Such is the recompense of the wrongdoers. ) means, this is the recompense of every unjust person.

  59,20,"<h2>The Command to have Taqwa and to prepare for the Day of Resurrection</h2> Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Mundhir bin Jarir narrated that his father said, \"While we were in the company of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in the early hours of the morning, some people came there who were barefooted, naked, wearing striped woolen clothes, or cloaks, with their swords hung (around their necks). Most of them, nay, all of them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar. The color of the face of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ underwent a change when he saw them in poverty. He then entered (his house) and came out and commanded Bilal to pronounce Adhan. Bilal pronounced Adhan and Iqamah, and the Prophet led the prayer. He then addressed them, first reciting,  يَـأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ  (O mankind! Have Taqwa of your Lord, Who created you from a single person... ) (4:1), until the end of the Ayah. Then he recited the Ayah that is in Surat Al-Hashr:  وَلْتَنظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ  (and let every person look to what he has sent forth for tomorrow,\") He then said, \"A man donated his Dinar, his Dirham, from his clothes, from his Sa` of wheat, from his Sa` of dates\" -- until he said -- \"even if it was half a date.\" Then a person among the Ansar came there with a moneybag, which his hands could scarcely lift; in fact, his hands could not lift it. Then the people followed continuously, until I saw two heaps of eatables and clothes. I saw the face of the Messenger radiate with pleasure, like gold. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «مَنْ سَنَّ فِي الْإِسْلَامِ سُنَّةً حَسَنَةً فَلَهُ أَجْرُهَا وَأَجْرُ مَنْ عَمِلَ بِهَا بَعْدَهُ، مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يُنْقَصَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْءٌ، وَمَنْ سَنَّ فِي الْإِسْلَامِ سُنَّةً سَيِّئَةً كَانَ عَلَيْهِ وِزْرُهَا وَوِزْرُ مَنْ عَمِلَ بِهَا، مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يُنْقَصَ مِنْ أَوْزَارِهِمْ شَيْء»  (He who sets a good example in Islam, there is a reward for him for this (act of goodness) and reward of that also who acted according to it subsequently, without any deduction from their rewards. Whoever sets in Islam an evil example, there is upon him the burden of that evil and the burden of him also who acted upon it subsequently, without any deduction from their burden.)\" Muslim recorded this Hadith via the chain of Shu`bah. Therefore, Allah's statement,  يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ اتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ  (O you who believe! Have Taqwa of Allah), ordains the Taqwa of Allah which pertains to obeying what He ordered and staying away from what He forbade. Allah said,  وَلْتَنظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ  (and let every person look to what he has sent forth for tomorrow,) meaning, hold yourselves accountable before you are recompensed, and contemplate what you have kept for yourselves of good deeds for the Day of your return and being paraded before your Lord,  وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ  (Have Taqwa of Allah), again ordering Taqwa,  إِنَّ اللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ  (Verily, Allah is All-Aware of what you do.) Allah asserts that surely, He knows all of your deeds -- O mankind -- and actions. Nothing that pertains to you ever escapes His observation, nor any matter of yours, whether major or minor, is ever beyond His knowledge,  وَلاَ تَكُونُواْ كَالَّذِينَ نَسُواْ اللَّهَ فَأَنسَـهُمْ أَنفُسَهُمْ  (And be not like those who forgot Allah, and He caused them to forget themselves.) meaning, do not forget the remembrance of Allah, the Exalted, otherwise, He will make you forget to perform the good deeds that benefit you in your return, because the recompense is equated with the action. This is why Allah the Exalted said,  أُولَـئِكَ هُمُ الْفَـسِقُونَ  (Those are the rebellious.) referring to those who rebel against obedience to Allah, who will earn destruction on the Day of Resurrection and failure upon their return,  يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تُلْهِكُمْ أَمْوَلُكُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلَـدُكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَلِكَ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْخَـسِرُونَ  (O you who believe! Let not your properties or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. And whosoever does that, then they are the losers.)(63:9) <h2>The Residents of Paradise and the Residents of Hell are never Equal</h2> Allah said,  لاَ يَسْتَوِى أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ وَأَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ  (Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise.) meaning, these two categories of people are never the same with regards to the judgement of Allah, the Exalted, on the Day of Resurrection. Allah said in other Ayat,  أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُواْ السَّيِّئَـتِ أَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ سَوَآءً مَّحْيَـهُمْ وَمَمَـتُهُمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ  (Or do those who earn evil deeds think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous good deeds, in their present life and after their death Worst is the judgement that they make.)(45:21),  وَمَا يَسْتَوِى الاٌّعْـمَى وَالْبَصِيرُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ وَلاَ الْمُسِىءُ قَلِيـلاً مَّا تَتَذَكَّرُونَ  (And not equal are the blind and those who see; nor are those who believe and do righteous good deeds and those who do evil. Little do you remember!)(40:58), and,  أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ كَالْمُفْسِدِينَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الْمُتَّقِينَ كَالْفُجَّارِ  (Shall We treat those who believe and do righteous good deeds as corrupters on earth Or shall We treat those who have Taqwa as the wicked)(38:28) Therefore, Allah asserts that He will honor the righteous and humiliate the sinners, and this is why He said here,  أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ هُمُ الْفَآئِزُونَ  (It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be successful.) that is, they are those who will earn safety and deliverance from the torment of Allah the Exalted and Most Honored.

  59,24,"<h2>Asserting the Greatness of the Qur'an</h2> Allah the Exalted emphasizes the greatness of the Qur'an, its high status and of being worthy of making hearts humble and rent asunder upon hearing it, because of the true promises and sure threats that it contains,  لَوْ أَنزَلْنَا هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانَ عَلَى جَبَلٍ لَّرَأَيْتَهُ خَـشِعاً مُّتَصَدِّعاً مِّنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ  (Had We sent down this Qur'an on a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rent asunder by the fear of Allah.) If this is the case with a mountain which is hard and huge, that if it was made able to comprehend and understand this Qur'an, will feel humble and crumble from fear of Allah the Exalted, then what about you -- O mankind Why do your hearts not feel softness and humbleness from the fear of Allah, even though you understand Allah's command and comprehend His Book This is why Allah said,  وَتِلْكَ الاٌّمْثَـلُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ  (Such are the parables which We put forward to mankind that they may reflect.) There is a Hadith of the Mutawatir grade that states that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ had someone make him a Minbar. Before that, he used to stand next to a tree trunk in the Masjid to deliver speeches. So, when the Minbar was made and placed in the Masjid, the Prophet came to deliver a speech and passed the tree trunk, headed towards the Minbar, the tree trunk started weeping, just like an infant. The tree trunk missed hearing the remembrance of Allah and the revelation that were being recited next to it. In one of the narrations for this Hadith, Al-Hasan Al-Basri said after narrating the Hadith, \"You - mankind -- are more worthy to miss the Messenger of Allah ﷺ than the tree trunk!\" tLikewise, this honorable Ayah asks that if the solid mountains feel humble and are rent asunder from the fear of Allah, if it heard Allah's Speech and comprehended it, what about you -- O mankind -- who heard the Qur'an and understood it Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,  وَلَوْ أَنَّ قُرْآنًا سُيِّرَتْ بِهِ الْجِبَالُ أَوْ قُطِّعَتْ بِهِ الاٌّرْضُ أَوْ كُلِّمَ بِهِ الْمَوْتَى  (And if there had been a Qur'an with which mountains could be moved, or the earth could be cloven asunder, or the dead could be made to speak.)(13:31) We mentioned the meaning of this Ayah as stating that, if there were a Qur'an that has these qualities, it would be this Qur'an. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,  وَإِنَّ مِنَ الْحِجَارَةِ لَمَا يَتَفَجَّرُ مِنْهُ الأَنْهَـرُ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَشَّقَّقُ فَيَخْرُجُ مِنْهُ الْمَآءُ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَهْبِطُ مِنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ  (And indeed, there are stones out of which rivers gush forth, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which split asunder so that water flows from them, and indeed, there are of them which fall down for fear of Allah.)(2:74) <h2>Glorifying Allah the Exalted by mentioning His Names and Attributes</h2> Allah the Exalted said,  هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِى لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَـدَةِ هُوَ الرَّحْمَـنُ الرَّحِيمُ  (He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.) Allah states that He Alone is worthy of worship, there is no Lord or God for the existence, except Him. All that is being worshipped instead of Allah are false deities. Allah is the All-Knower in the unseen and the seen, He knows all that pertains to the creations that we see, and those we cannot see. Nothing in heaven or on earth ever escapes His knowledge, no matter how great or insignificant, big or small, including ants in darkness. Allah's statement,  هُوَ الرَّحْمَـنُ الرَّحِيمُ  (He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.) was duly explained before at the very beginning of this Tafsir, so it is not necessary to repeat it here, and it asserts that Allah is the Owner of the wide encompassing mercy that entails all of His creation. He is Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim of this life and the Hereafter. Allah the Exalted said in other Ayat,  وَرَحْمَتِى وَسِعَتْ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ  (And My mercy embraces all things.)(7:156),  كَتَبَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ الرَّحْمَةَ  (Your Lord has written (prescribed) mercy for Himself.)(6:54), and,  قُلْ بِفَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَبِرَحْمَتِهِ فَبِذَلِكَ فَلْيَفْرَحُواْ هُوَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ  (Say: \"In the bounty of Allah, and in His mercy; -- therein let them rejoice.\" That is better than what (the wealth) they amass.)(10:58) Allah the Exalted said,  هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِى لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْمَلِكُ  (He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, Al-Malik.) Al-Malik, meaning \"The Owner and King of all things,\" Who has full power over them without resistance or hindrance. Allah's statement,  الْقُدُّوسُ  (Al-Quddus,) meaning \"The Pure,\" according to Wahb bin Munabbih, while Mujahid and Qatadah said that Al-Quddus means \"The Blessed.\" Ibn Jurayj said that Al-Quddus means \"He Whom the honorable angels glorify.\"  السَّلَـمُ  (As-Salam,) meaning \"Free from any defects or shortcomings that lessen or decrease His perfect attributes and actions.\" Allah's statement,  الْمُؤْمِنُ  (Al-Mu'min,) means \"Who has granted safety to His servants by promising that He will never be unjust to them, \" according to Ad-Dahhak who reported it from Ibn `Abbas. Qatadah said that Al-Mu'min means that \"Allah affirms that His statements are true,\" while Ibn Zayd said that it means, \"He attested to His faithful servants' having faith in Him.\" Allah's statement,  الْمُهَيْمِنُ  (Al-Muhaymin,) means, according to Ibn `Abbas and others, \"The Witness for His servants actions,\" that is, the Ever-Watcher over them. Allah said in similar Ayat,  وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيدٌ  (And Allah is Witness over all things.)(58:6),  ثُمَّ اللَّهُ شَهِيدٌ عَلَى مَا يَفْعَلُونَ  (and moreover Allah is Witness over what they used to do.)(10:46), and,  أَفَمَنْ هُوَ قَآئِمٌ عَلَى كُلِّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ  (Is then He (Allah) Who takes charge (guards) of every person and knows all that he has earned)(13:33) Allah said,  الْعَزِيزُ  (Al-`Aziz,) meaning that \"He is the Almighty, Dominant over all things.\" Therefore, His majesty is never violated, due to His might, greatness, irresistible power and pride. Allah said;  الْجَبَّارُ الْمُتَكَبِّرُ  (Al-Jabbar, Al-Mutakabbir), meaning \"The Only One worthy of being the Compeller and Supreme.\" There is a Hadith in the Sahih Collection in which Allah said,  «الْعَظَمَةُ إِزَارِي، وَالْكِبْرِيَاءُ رِدَائِي، فَمَنْ نَازَعَنِي وَاحِدًا مِنْهُمَا عَذَّبْتُه»  (Might is My Izar and pride is My Rida; if anyone disputes any one of them with Me, then I will punish him.) Allah the Exalted said,  سُبْحَـنَ اللَّهِ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ  (Glory be to Allah! (High is He) above all that they associate as partners with Him.), then He said,  هُوَ اللَّهُ الْخَـلِقُ الْبَارِىءُ الْمُصَوِّرُ  (He is Allah, Al-Khaliq, Al-Bari, Al-Musawwir.) Al-Khaliq refers to measuring and proportioning, Al-Bari refers to inventing and bringing into existence what He has created and measured. Surely, none except Allah is able to measure, bring forth and create whatever He wills to come to existence. Allah's statement,  الْخَـلِقُ الْبَارِىءُ الْمُصَوِّرُ  (Al-Khaliq, Al-Bari, Al-Musawwir.) means, if Allah wills something, He merely says to it \"be\" and it comes to existence in the form that He wills and the shape He chooses,  فِى أَىِّ صُورَةٍ مَّا شَآءَ رَكَّبَكَ  (In whatever form He willed, He put you together.)(82:8) Allah describing Himself as being Al-Musawwir, Who brings into existence anything He wills in the shape and form He decides. <h2>Al-Asma' Al-Husna</h2> Allah the Exalted said,  لَهُ الاٌّسْمَآءُ الْحُسْنَى  (To Him belong Al-Asma' Al-Husna (the Best Names).) We explained the meaning of this Ayah in the Tafsir of Surat Al-A`raf. The Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «إِنَّ للهِ تَعَالَى تِسْعَةً وَتِسْعِينَ اسْمًا، مِائَةً إِلَّا وَاحِدًا، مَنْ أَحْصَاهَا دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ، وَهُوَ وِتْرٌ يُحِبُّ الْوِتْر»  (Allah the Exalted has ninety-nine Names, one hundred less one; whoever then preserves them, will enter Paradise. Allah is Witr (One) and He likes the Witr.) <h2>Everything praises and glorifies Allah</h2> Allah's statement,  يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ  (All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him.) is similar to His other statement,  تُسَبِّحُ لَهُ السَّمَـوَتُ السَّبْعُ وَالاٌّرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ وَإِن مِّن شَىْءٍ إِلاَّ يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدَهِ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تَفْقَهُونَ تَسْبِيحَهُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ حَلِيمًا غَفُورًا  (The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise. But you understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft--Forgiving.)(17:44) Allah's statement,  وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ  (and He is Al-`Aziz) The Almighty, meaning, His greatness is never humbled,  الْحَكِيمُ  (Al-Hakim) the All-Wise, in His legislation and decrees This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Hashr. All praise is due to Allah. "
