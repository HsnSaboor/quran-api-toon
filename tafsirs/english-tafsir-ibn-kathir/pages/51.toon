  3,11,"<h2>On the Day of Resurrection, No Wealth or Offspring Shall Avail</h2> Allah states that the disbelievers shall be fuel for the Fire, ﴾يَوْمَ لاَ يَنفَعُ الظَّـلِمِينَ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ وَلَهُمُ الْلَّعْنَةُ وَلَهُمْ سُوءُ الدَّارِ ﴿ (The Day when their excuses will be of no profit to wrongdoers. Theirs will be the curse, and theirs will be the evil abode (i.e. painful torment in Hell-fire).) 40:52.  Further, what they were granted in this life of wealth and offspring shall not avail them with Allah, or save them from His punishment and severe torment. Similarly, Allah said, ﴾فَلاَ تُعْجِبْكَ أَمْوَلُهُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلَـدُهُمْ إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيُعَذِّبَهُمْ بِهَا فِي الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَتَزْهَقَ أَنفُسُهُمْ وَهُمْ كَـفِرُونَ ﴿ (So let not their wealth nor their children amaze you; in reality Allah's plan is to punish them with these things in the life of this world, and that their souls shall depart (die) while they are disbelievers.) 9:55, and, ﴾لاَ يَغُرَّنَّكَ تَقَلُّبُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فِى الْبِلَـدِ - مَتَـعٌ قَلِيلٌ ثُمَّ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ ﴿ (Let not the free disposal (and affluence) of the disbelievers throughout the land deceive you. A brief enjoyment; then, their ultimate abode is Hell; and worst indeed is that place for rest.) 3:196, 197.  Allah said in this Ayah 3:10, ﴾إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ﴿ (Verily, those who disbelieve) meaning, disbelieved in Allah's Ayat, denied His Messengers, defied His Books and did not benefit from His revelation to His Prophets, ﴾لَن تُغْنِىَ عَنْهُمْ أَمْوَلُهُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلـدُهُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئًا وَأُولَـئِكَ هُمْ وَقُودُ النَّارِ﴿ (Neither their properties nor their offspring will avail them whatsoever against Allah; and it is they who will be fuel of the Fire.) meaning, they will be the wood with which the Fire is kindled and fed. Similarly, Allah said, ﴾إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ﴿ (Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) 21:98.  Allah said next, ﴾كَدَأْبِ ءَالِ فِرْعَوْنَ﴿ (Like the Da'b of the people of Fira`wn.) Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah means, \"Like the behavior of the people of Fir`awn.\" This is the same Tafsir of `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Abu Malik, Ad-Dahhak, and others. Other scholars said that the Ayah means, \"Like the practice, conduct, likeness of the people of Fir`awn.\" These meanings are all plausible, for the Da'b means practice, behavior, tradition and habit. The Ayah indicates that the disbelievers will not benefit from their wealth or offspring. Rather, they will perish and be punished. This is the same end the people of Fir`awn and the previous nations met, those who rejected the Messengers, the Ayat, and proofs of Allah that they were sent with. ﴾وَاللَّهُ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ﴿ (And Allah is severe in punishment.) meaning, His punishment is severe and His torment is painful. None can escape Allah's grasp, nor does anything escape His knowledge. Allah does what He wills and prevails over all things, it is He to Whom everything is humbled and there is no deity worthy of worship, nor any Lord except Him. "

  3,13,"<h2>Threatening the Jews With Defeat and Encouraging Them to Learn a Lesson From the Battle of Badr</h2> Allah commanded the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ to proclaim to the disbelievers,  سَتُغْلَبُونَ  (You will be defeated) in this life,  وَتُحْشَرُونَ  (And gathered together) on the Day of Resurrection,  إِلَى جَهَنَّمَ وَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ  (to Hell, and worst indeed is that place of rest)  Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar recorded that `Asim bin `Umar bin Qatadah said that when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gained victory in the battle of Badr and went back to Al-Madinah, he gathered the Jews in the marketplace of Bani Qaynuqa`.  Therefore, Allah said,  قَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ ءَايَةٌ  (There has already been a sign for you) meaning, O Jews, who said what you said! You have an Ayah, meaning proof, that Allah will make His religion prevail, award victory to His Messenger, make His Word apparent and His religion the highest.  فِي فِئَتَيْنِ  (In the two armies) meaning, two camps,  الْتَقَتَا  (that met) in combat (in Badr),  فِئَةٌ تُقَـتِلُ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ  (One was fighting in the Cause of Allah) the Muslims,  وَأُخْرَى كَافِرَةٌ  (And as for the other, in disbelief) meaning, the idolators of Quraysh at Badr. Allah's statement,  يَرَوْنَهُمْ مِّثْلَيْهِمْ رَأْىَ الْعَيْنِ  (They saw them with their own eyes twice their number) means, the idolators thought that the Muslims were twice as many as they were, for Allah made this illusion a factor in the victory that Islam had over them.  It was said that the meaning of Allah's statement,  يَرَوْنَهُمْ مِّثْلَيْهِمْ رَأْىَ الْعَيْنِ  (They saw them with their own eyes twice their number) is that the Muslims saw twice as many idolators as they were, yet Allah gave them victory over the disbelievers. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When we looked at the disbelievers' forces, we found that they were twice as many as we were. When we looked at them again, we thought they did not have one man more than we had. So Allah's statement,  وَإِذْ يُرِيكُمُوهُمْ إِذِ الْتَقَيْتُمْ فِى أَعْيُنِكُمْ قَلِيلاً وَيُقَلِّلُكُمْ فِى أَعْيُنِهِمْ  (And (remember) when you met, He showed them to you as few in your eyes and He made you appear as few in their eyes.) 8:44\".  When the two camps saw each other, the Muslims thought that the idolators were twice as many as they were, so that they would trust in Allah and seek His help. The idolators thought that the believers were twice as many as they were, so that they would feel fear, horror, fright and despair. When the two camps stood in lines and met in battle, Allah made each camp look smaller in the eyes of the other camp, so that they would be encouraged to fight each other,  لِّيَقْضِيَ اللَّهُ أَمْراً كَانَ مَفْعُولاً  (so that Allah might accomplish a matter already ordained.) 8:42 meaning, so that the truth and falsehood are distinguishable, and thus the word of faith prevails over disbelief and deviation, so that the believers prevail and the disbelievers are humiliated. In a similar statement, Allah said;  وَلَقَدْ نَصَرَكُمُ اللَّهُ بِبَدْرٍ وَأَنتُمْ أَذِلَّةٌ  (And Allah has already made you victorious at Badr, when you were a weak little force) 3:123. In this Ayah 3:13 Allah said,  وَاللَّهُ يُؤَيِّدُ بِنَصْرِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لاوْلِى الاٌّبْصَـرِ  (And Allah supports with His victory whom He wills. Verily, in this is a lesson for those who understand.) meaning, this should be an example for those who have intelligence and sound comprehension. They should contemplate about Allah's wisdom, decisions and decree, that He gives victory to His believing servants in this life and on the Day the witnesses stand up to testify. "

  3,15,"<h2>The True Value of This Earthly Life</h2> Allah mentions the delights that He put in this life for people, such as women and children, and He started with women, because the test with them is more tempting. For instance, the Sahih recorded that the Messenger ﷺ said,  «مَا تَرَكْتُ بَعْدِي فِتْنَةً أَضَرَّ عَلَى الرِّجَالِ مِنَ النِّسَاء»  (I did not leave behind me a test more tempting to men than women.)  When one enjoys women for the purpose of having children and preserving his chastity, then he is encouraged to do so. There are many Hadiths that encourage getting married, such as,  «وَإِنَّ خَيْرَ هذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ مَنْ كَانَ أَكْثَرَهَا نِسَاء»  (Verily, the best members of this Ummah are those who have the most wives) He also said,  «الدُّنْيَا مَتَاعٌ، وَخَيْرُ مَتَاعِهَا الْمَرْأَةُ الصَّالِحَة»  (This life is a delight, and the best of its delight is a righteous wife)  The Prophet said in another Hadith,  «حُبِّبَ إِلَيَّ النِّسَاءُ وَالطِّيبُ، وَجُعِلَتْ قُرَّةُ عَيْنِي فِي الصَّلَاة»  (I was made to like women and perfume, and the comfort of my eye is the prayer.)  `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said, \"Nothing was more beloved to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ than women, except horses,\" and in another narration, \"...than horses except women.\"  The desire to have children is sometimes for the purpose of pride and boasting, and as such, is a temptation. When the purpose for having children is to reproduce and increase the Ummah of Muhammad with those who worship Allah alone without partners, then it is encouraged and praised. A Hadith states,  «تَزَوَّجُوا الْوَدُودَ الْوَلُودَ، فَإِنِّي مُكَاثِرٌ بِكُمُ الْأُمَمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»  (Marry the Wadud (kind) and Walud (fertile) woman, for I will compare your numbers to the rest of the nations on the Day of Resurrection.)  The desire of wealth sometimes results out of arrogance, and the desire to dominate the weak and control the poor, and this conduct is prohibited. Sometimes, the want for more money is for the purpose of spending it on acts of worship, being kind to the family, the relatives, and spending on various acts of righteousness and obedience; this behavior is praised and encouraged in the religion.  Scholars of Tafsir have conflicting opinions about the amount of the Qintar, all of which indicate that the Qintar is a large amount of money, as Ad-Dahhak and other scholars said. Abu Hurayrah said \"The Qintar is twelve thousand Uwqiyah, each Uwqiyah is better than what is between the heavens and earth.\" This was recorded by Ibn Jarir .  The desire to have horses can be one of three types. Sometimes, owners of horses collect them to be used in the cause of Allah, and when warranted, they use their horses in battle. This type of owner shall be rewarded for this good action. Another type collects horses to boast, and out of enmity to the people of Islam, and this type earns a burden for his behavior. Another type collects horses to fulfill their needs and to collect their offspring, and they do not forget Allah's right due on their horses. This is why in this case, these horses provide a shield of sufficiency for their owner, as evident by a Hadith that we will mention, Allah willing, when we explain Allah's statement,  وَأَعِدُّواْ لَهُمْ مَّا اسْتَطَعْتُم مّن قُوَّةٍ وَمِن رّبَاطِ الْخَيْلِ  (And make ready against them all you can of power, including steeds of war.) 8:60.  As for the Musawwamah horses, Ibn `Abbas said that they are the branded, beautiful horses. This is the same explanation of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Abdullah bin Abza, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Abu Sinan and others. Makhul said the Musawwamah refers to the horse with a white spotted faced, and the horse with white feet. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «لَيْسَ مِنْ فَرَسٍ عَرَبِيَ إِلَّا يُؤْذَنُ لَهُ مَعَ كُلِّ فَجْرٍ يَدْعُو بِدَعْوَتَيْنِ يَقُولُ: اللَّهُمَّ إِنَّكَ خَوَّلْتَنِي مِنْ بَنِي آدَمَ، فَاجْعَلْنِي مِنْ أَحَبِّ مَالِهِ وَأَهْلِهِ إِلَيْهِ أَوْ أَحَبَّ أَهْلِهِ وَمَالِهِ إِلَيْه»  (Every Arabian horse is allowed to have two supplications every dawn, and the horse supplicates, `O Allah! You made me subservient to the son of Adam. Therefore, make me among the dearest of his wealth and household to him, or, ...make me the dearest of his household and wealth to him.)  Allah's statement,  وَالاٌّنْعَـمُ  (Cattle) means, camels, cows and sheep.  وَالْحَرْثِ  (And fertile land) meaning, the land that is used to farm and grow plants.  Allah then said,  ذَلِكَ مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا  (This is the pleasure of the present world's life) meaning, these are the delights of this life and its short lived joys,  وَاللَّهُ عِندَهُ حُسْنُ الْمَأَبِ  (But Allah has the excellent return with Him) meaning, the best destination and reward. <h2>The Reward of the Those Who Have Taqwa is Better Than All Joys of This World</h2> This is why Allah said,  قُلْ أَؤُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِخَيْرٍ مِّن ذَلِكُمْ  (Say: \"Shall I inform you of things far better than those\")  This Ayah means, \"Say, O Muhammad, to the people, `Should I tell you about what is better than the delights and joys of this life that will soon perish\"' Allah informed them of what is better when He said,  لِلَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْاْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ جَنَّـتٌ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَارُ  (For those who have Taqwa there are Gardens (Paradise) with their Lord, underneath which rivers flow) meaning, rivers run throughout it. These rivers carry various types of drinks: honey, milk, wine and water such that no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard, and no heart has ever imagined,  خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ  (Therein (is their) eternal (home)) meaning, they shall remain in it forever and ever and will not want to be removed from it.  وَأَزْوَجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ  (And Azwajun Mutahharatun (purified mates or wives)) meaning, from filth, dirt, harm, menstruation, post birth bleeding, and other things that affect women in this world.  وَرِضْوَنٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ  (And Allah will be pleased with them) meaning, Allah's pleasure will descend on them and He shall never be angry with them after that. This is why Allah said in in Surah Bara`ah,  وَرِضْوَنٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ  (But the pleasure of Allah is greater) 9:72, meaning, greater than the eternal delight that He has granted them. Allah then said,  وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِالْعِبَادِ  (And Allah is All-Seer of the (His) servants) and, He gives each provisions according to what they deserve. "
