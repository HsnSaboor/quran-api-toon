tafsir[23]{c,v,t}:
  26,184,"<h2>The Command to give Full Measure</h2> Allah commanded them to give full measure, and forbade them to give short measure. He said: ﴾أَوْفُواْ الْكَيْلَ وَلاَ تَكُونُواْ مِنَ الْمُخْسِرِينَ ﴿ (Give full measure, and cause no loss.) meaning, `when you give to people, give them full measure, and do not cause loss to them by giving them short measure, while taking full measure when you are the ones who are taking. Give as you take, and take as you give.' ﴾وَزِنُواْ بِالْقِسْطَاسِ الْمُسْتَقِيمِ ﴿ (And weigh with the true and straight balance.) The balance is the scales. ﴾وَلاَ تَبْخَسُواْ النَّاسَ أَشْيَاءَهُمْ﴿ (And defraud not people by reducing their things,) means, do not shortchange them. ﴾وَلاَ تَعْثَوْاْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ﴿ (nor do evil, making corruption and mischief in the land.) means, by engaging in banditry. This is like the Ayah, ﴾وَلاَ تَقْعُدُواْ بِكُلِّ صِرَطٍ تُوعِدُونَ﴿ (And sit not on every road, threatening) (7:86). ﴾وَاتَّقُواْ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ وَالْجِبِلَّةَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ ﴿ (And have Taqwa of Him Who created you and the generations of the men of old. ) Here he is frightening them with the punishment of Allah Who created them and created their forefathers. This is like when Musa, peace be upon him, said: ﴾رَبُّكُمْ وَرَبُّ ءَابَآئِكُمُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ﴿ (Your Lord and the Lord of your ancient fathers!) (26:26). Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, As-Suddi, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said: ﴾وَالْجِبِلَّةَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ﴿ (the generations of the men of old.) means, He created the early generations. And Ibn Zayd recited: ﴾وَلَقَدْ أَضَلَّ مِنْكُمْ جِبِلاًّ كَثِيراً﴿ (And indeed he (Shaytan) did lead astray a great multitude of you) (36:62). ﴾قَالُواْ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مِنَ الْمُسَحَّرِينَ ﴿﴾وَمَآ أَنتَ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مّثْلُنَا وَإِن نَّظُنُّكَ لَمِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ-﴿﴾فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مّنَ السَّمَآء إِن كُنتَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ-﴿﴾قَالَ رَبّى أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ-﴿﴾فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ-﴿"

  26,191,"<h2>The Response of Shu`ayb's People, Their Disbelief in Him and the coming of the Punishment upon Them</h2> Allah tells us how his people responded, and how it was like the response of Thamud to their Messenger -- for they were of like mind -- when they said: ﴾إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مِنَ الْمُسَحَّرِينَ﴿ (You are only one of those bewitched!) meaning, `you are one of those who are affected by witchcraft.' ﴾وَمَآ أَنتَ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا وَإِن نَّظُنُّكَ لَمِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ ﴿ (You are but a human being like us and verily, we think that you are one of the liars!) means, `we think you are deliberately lying to us in what you say, and Allah has not sent you to us.' ﴾فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ﴿ (So cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us,) Ad-Dahhak said: \"One side of the heavens.\" Qatadah said: \"A piece of the heaven.\" As-Suddi said: \"A punishment from heaven.\" This is like what the Quraysh said, as Allah tells us: ﴾وَقَالُواْ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّى تَفْجُرَ لَنَا مِنَ الاٌّرْضِ يَنْبُوعًا ﴿ (And they say: \"We shall not believe in you, until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us) until: ﴾أَوْ تُسْقِطَ السَّمَآءَ كَمَا زَعَمْتَ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفًا أَوْ تَأْتِىَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةِ قَبِيلاً ﴿ (Or you cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces, as you have pretended, or you bring Allah and the angels before (us) face to face.\") (17:90-92) ﴾وَإِذْ قَالُواْ اللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ﴿ (And (remember) when they said: \"O Allah! If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky....\") (8:32). Similarly, these ignorant disbelievers said: ﴾فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ﴿ (So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!) ﴾قَالَ رَبِّى أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ ﴿ (He said: \"My Lord is the Best Knower of what you do.\") means, `Allah knows best about you, and if you deserve that, He will punish you therewith, and He will not treat you unjustly.' So this is what happened to them -- as they asked for -- an exact recompense. Allah says: ﴾فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ ﴿ (But they denied him, so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) This is what they asked for, when they asked for a part of the heaven to fall upon them. Allah made their punishment in the form of intense heat which overwhelmed them for seven days, and nothing could protect them from it. Then He sent a cloud to shade them, so they ran towards it to seek its shade from the heat. When all of them had gathered underneath it, Allah sent sparks of fire and flames and intense heat upon them, and caused the earth to convulse beneath them, and He sent against them a mighty Sayhah which destroyed their souls. Allah says: ﴾إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ﴿ (Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Allah has mentioned how they were destroyed in three places in the Qur'an, in each of which it is described in a manner which fits the context. In Surat Al-A`raf He says that the earthquake seized them, and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes. This was because they said: ﴾لَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ أَوْ لَتَعُودُنَّ فِي مِلَّتِنَا﴿ (\"We shall certainly drive you out, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you from our town, or else you (all) shall return to our religion.\") (7:88). They had sought to scare the Prophet of Allah and those who followed him, so they were seized by the earthquake. In Surah Hud, Allah says: ﴾وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ﴿ (And As-Sayhah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). This was because they mocked the Allah's Prophet when they said: ﴾أَصَلَوَتُكَ تَأْمُرُكَ أَن نَّتْرُكَ مَا يَعْبُدُ ءابَاؤُنَآ أَوْ أَن نَّفْعَلَ فِى أَمْوَالِنَا مَا نَشَؤُا إِنَّكَ لاّنتَ الْحَلِيمُ الرَّشِيدُ﴿ (\"Does your Salah command that we give up what our fathers used to worship, or that we give up doing what we like with our property Verily, you are the forbearer, right-minded!\") (11:87). They had said this in a mocking, sarcastic tone, so it was befitting that the Sayhah should come and silence them, as Allah says: ﴾فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَةُ﴿ (So As-Saihah overtook them) (15:73). ﴾وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ﴿ (And As-Saihah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). And here, they said: ﴾فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ﴿ (So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us,) in a stubborn and obstinate manner. So, it was fitting that something they never thought would happen should befall them: ﴾فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ﴿ (so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Muhammad bin Jarir narrated from Yazid Al-Bahili: \"I asked Ibn `Abbas about this Ayah: ﴾فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ﴿ (so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. ) He said: `Allah sent upon them thunder and intense heat, and it terrified them so they entered their houses and it pursued them to the innermost parts of their houses and terrified them further, and they ran fleeing from their houses into the fields. Then Allah sent upon them clouds which shaded them from the sun, and they found it cool and pleasant, so they called out to one another until they had all gathered beneath the cloud, then Allah sent fire upon them.' Ibn `Abbas said, `That was the torment of the Day of Shadow, indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.\"' ﴾إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لأَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ ﴿ (Verily, in this is an Ayah, yet most of them are not believers. And verily, your Lord, He is truly, the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.) (26:8-9) meaning, He is All-Mighty in His punishment of the disbelievers, and Most Merciful towards His believing servants. "

  26,195,"<h2>The Qur'an was revealed by Allah</h2> Here Allah tells us about the Book which He revealed to His servant and Messenger Muhammad ﷺ.  وَأَنَّهُ  (And truly, this) refers to the Qur'an, which at the beginning of the Surah was described as  وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَـنِ مُحْدَثٍ  (and never comes there unto them a Reminder as a recent revelation from the Most Gracious...) (26:5).  لَتَنزِيلُ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ  (is a revelation from the Lord of Al-`Alamin.) means, Allah has sent it down to you and revealed it to you.  نَزَلَ بِهِ الرُّوحُ الاٌّمِينُ  (Which the trustworthy Ruh has brought down.) This refers to Jibril, peace be upon him. This was the view of more than one of the Salaf: Ibn `Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Qatadah, `Atiyyah Al-`Awfi, As-Suddi, Ad-Dahhak, Az-Zuhri and Ibn Jurayj. This is an issue concerning which there is no dispute. Az-Zuhri said, \"This is like the Ayah:  قُلْ مَن كَانَ عَدُوًّا لِّجِبْرِيلَ فَإِنَّهُ نَزَّلَهُ عَلَى قَلْبِكَ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ  (Say: \"Whoever is an enemy to Jibril -- for indeed he has brought it down to your heart by Allah's permission, confirming what came before it...\") (2:97).  عَلَى قَلْبِكَ  (Upon your heart) `O Muhammad, free from any contamination, with nothing added or taken away.'  لِتَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُنْذِرِينَ  (that you may be of the warners,) means, `so that you may warn people with it of the punishment of Allah for those who go against it and disbelieve in it, and so that you may give glad tidings with it to the believers who follow it.'  بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِىٍّ مُّبِينٍ  (In the plain Arabic language.) meaning, `this Qur'an which We have revealed to you, We have revealed in perfect and eloquent Arabic, so that it may be quite clear, leaving no room for excuses and establishing clear proof, showing the straight path.'  وَإِنَّهُ لَفِى زُبُرِ الاٌّوَّلِينَ أَوَلَمْيَكُن لَّهُمْ ءَايَةً أَن يَعْلَمَهُ عُلَمَاءُ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَوَلَوْ نَزَّلْنَـهُ عَلَى بَعْضِ الاٌّعْجَمِينَ "

  26,199,"<h2>The Qur'an was mentioned in the Previous Scriptures</h2> Allah says: this Qur'an was mentioned and referred to in the previous Scriptures that were left behind by their Prophets who foretold it in ancient times and more recently. Allah took a covenant from them that they would follow it, and the last of them stood and addressed his people with the good news of Ahmad:  وَإِذْ قَالَ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ يبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُم مُّصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَىَّ مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَمُبَشِّراً بِرَسُولٍ يَأْتِى مِن بَعْدِى اسْمُهُ أَحْمَدُ  (And (remember) when `Isa, son of Maryam, said: \"O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah unto you, confirming the Tawrah before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.) (61:6) Zubur here refers to Books; Zubur is the plural of Az-Zabur, which is also the name used to refer to the Book given to Dawud. Allah says:  وَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ فَعَلُوهُ فِى الزُّبُرِ  (And everything they have done is noted in the Az-Zubur.) (54:52), meaning, it is recorded against them in the books of the angels. Then Allah says:  أَوَلَمْيَكُن لَّهُمْ ءَايَةً أَن يَعْلَمَهُ عُلَمَاءُ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ  (Is it not a sign to them that the learned scholars of the Children of Israel knew it) meaning, is it not sufficient witness to the truth for them that the scholars of the Children of Israel found this Qur'an mentioned in the Scriptures which they study The meaning is: the fair-minded among them admitted that the attributes of Muhammad ﷺ and his mission and his Ummah were mentioned in their Books, as was stated by those among them who believed, such as `Abdullah bin Salam, Salman Al-Farisi and others who met the Prophet . Allah said:  الَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ الرَّسُولَ النَّبِىَّ الأُمِّىَّ  (Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write ...) (7:157) <h2>The Intense Disbelief of Quraysh</h2> Then Allah tells us how intense the disbelief of Quraysh was, and how stubbornly they resisted the Qur'an. If this Book with all its eloquence had been revealed to a non-Arab who did not know one word of Arabic, they still would not have believed in him. Allah says:  وَلَوْ نَزَّلْنَـهُ عَلَى بَعْضِ الاٌّعْجَمِينَ  فَقَرَأَهُ عَلَيْهِم مَّا كَانُوا بِهِ مُؤْمِنِينَ-  (And if We had revealed it unto any of the non-Arabs, And he had recited it unto them, they would not have believed in it.) And Allah says:  وَلَوْ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَاباً مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ فَظَلُّواْ فِيهِ يَعْرُجُونَ لَقَالُواْ إِنَّمَا سُكِّرَتْ أَبْصَـرُنَا  (And even if We opened to them a gate from the heaven and they were to keep on ascending thereto. They would surely say: \"Our eyes have been dazzled...\") (15:14-15)  وَلَوْ أَنَّنَا نَزَّلْنَآ إِلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ وَكَلَّمَهُمُ الْمَوْتَى  (And even if We had sent down unto them angels, and the dead had spoken unto them...) (6:111)  إِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ  (Truly, those, against whom the Word of your Lord has been justified, will not believe.) (10:96)  كَذَلِكَ سَلَكْنَاهُ فِي قُلُوبِ الْمُجْرِمِينَ - لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ - فَيَأْتِيَهُم بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ - فَيَقُولُواْ هَلْ نَحْنُ مُنظَرُونَ - أَفَبِعَذَابِنَا يَسْتَعْجِلُونَ - أَفَرَأَيْتَ إِن مَّتَّعْنَـهُمْ سِنِينَ - ثُمَّ جَآءَهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يُوعَدُونَ - مَآ أَغْنَى عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يُمَتَّعُونَ - وَمَآ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ إِلاَّ لَهَا مُنذِرُونَ "
