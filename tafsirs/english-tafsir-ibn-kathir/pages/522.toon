  51,37,"<h2>The Angels were sent to destroy the People of the Prophet Lut</h2> Allah the Exalted said about Ibrahim, peace be upon him, ﴾فَلَمَّا ذَهَبَ عَنْ إِبْرَهِيمَ الرَّوْعُ وَجَآءَتْهُ الْبُشْرَى يُجَـدِلُنَا فِى قَوْمِ لُوطٍ - إِنَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ لَحَلِيمٌ أَوَّاهٌ مُّنِيبٌ - يإِبْرَهِيمُ أَعْرِضْ عَنْ هَـذَآ إِنَّهُ قَدْ جَآءَ أَمْرُ رَبِّكَ وَإِنَّهُمْ آتِيهِمْ عَذَابٌ غَيْرُ مَرْدُودٍ ﴿ (Then when the fear had gone away from (Ibrahim), and the glad tidings had reached him, he began to plead with Us for the people of Lut. Verily, Ibrahim was, without doubt forbearing, used to invoke Allah with humility, and was repentant. \"O Ibrahim! Forsake this. Indeed, the commandment of your Lord has gone forth. Verily, there will come a torment for them which cannot be turned back.\")(11:74-76) Allah said here, ﴾قَالَ فَمَا خَطْبُكُمْ أَيُّهَا الْمُرْسَلُونَ ﴿ ((Ibrahim) said: \"Then for what purpose you have come, O messengers\") meaning, `what is the mission that you were sent with,' ﴾قَالُواْ إِنَّآ أُرْسِلْنَآ إِلَى قَوْمٍ مُّجْرِمِينَ ﴿ (They said: \"We have been sent to a people who are criminals.\") in reference to the people of Lut, ﴾لِنُرْسِلَ عَلَيْهِمْ حِجَارَةً مِّن طِينٍ مُّسَوَّمَةً﴿ (To send down upon them stones of baked clay, marked), or written, ﴾عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُسْرِفِينَ﴿ (by your Lord for transgressors.) recorded with Allah to their names; each stone has the name of its companion. Allah said in Surat Al-`Ankabut, ﴾قَالَ إِنَّ فِيهَا لُوطاً قَالُواْ نَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن فِيهَا لَنُنَجِّيَنَّهُ وَأَهْلَهُ إِلاَّ امْرَأَتَهُ كَانَتْ مِنَ الْغَـبِرِينَ ﴿ ((Ibrahim) said: \"But there is Lut in it.\" They said: \"We know better who is there. We will verily save him and his family except his wife: she will be of those who remain behind.\")(29:32), and said here, ﴾فَأَخْرَجْنَا مَن كَانَ فِيهَا مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ ﴿ (So We brought out from therein the believers.) they are: Lut and his family, except his wife, ﴾فَمَا وَجَدْنَا فِيهَا غَيْرَ بَيْتٍ مِّنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ ﴿ (But We found not there any household of the Muslims except one.) Allah the Exalted said, ﴾وَتَرَكْنَا فِيهَآ ءَايَةً لِّلَّذِينَ يَخَافُونَ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ ﴿ (And We have left there a sign for those who fear the painful torment.) meaning, `We left a proof of the punishment, torment and stones made of Sijjil (baked clay) that We sent on them; We made their dwelling place a putrid, evil, dead sea. This should provide a lesson for the believers,' ﴾لِّلَّذِينَ يَخَافُونَ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ﴿ (for those who fear the painful torment.) "

  51,46,"<h2>Lessons from the Destruction of Fir`awn, `Ad, Thamud, and the People of Nuh</h2> Allah the Exalted said,  وَفِى مُوسَى إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ بِسُلْطَـنٍ مُّبِينٍ  (And in Musa, when We sent him to Fir`awn with a manifest authority.) meaning, with clear proof and plain evidence,  فَتَوَلَّى بِرُكْنِهِ  (But he turned away along with his hosts,) meaning, in rebellion and arrogance, Fir`awn turned away from the plain truth that Musa was sent with,  ثَانِىَ عِطْفِهِ لِيُضِلَّ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ  (Bending his neck in pride, and leading (others) too (far) astray from the path of Allah.)(22:9 ), meaning turning away from truth in arrogance,  وَقَالَ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ  (and said: \"A sorcerer, or a madman.\") meaning Fir`awn said to Musa, \"With regards to the message that you brought me, you are either a magician or a madman.\" Allah the Exalted replied,  فَأَخَذْنَـهُ وَجُنُودَهُ فَنَبَذْنَـهُمْ  (So We took him and his armies, and dumped them), meaning `We threw them,'  فِى الْيَمِّ  (into the Yamm), into the sea,  وَهُوَ مُلِيمٌ  (for he was blameworthy.) meaning, Fir`awn was a denying sinner and a stubborn disbeliever worthy of blame. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,  وَفِى عَادٍ إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّيحَ الْعَقِيمَ  (And in `Ad when We sent against them the barren wind) that destroys everything and produces nothing. This was said by Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and others. Allah's statement,  مَا تَذَرُ مِن شَىْءٍ أَتَتْ عَلَيْهِ  (It spared nothing that it reached,) meaning, everything that the wind could destroy,  إِلاَّ جَعَلَتْهُ كَالرَّمِيمِ  (but blew it into broken spreads of rotten ruins.) meaning, made it just like a rotten and destroyed. Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib and others commented on:  إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّيحَ الْعَقِيمَ  (when We sent against them the barren wind),\"Southerly winds.\" However, there is a Hadith in the Sahih from Shu`bah bin Al-Hakam, from Mujahid, from Ibn `Abbas, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «نُصِرْتُ بِالصَّبَا وَأُهْلِكَتْ عَادٌ بِالدَّبُور»  (I have been made victorious with the Saba (easterly wind), and the people of `Ad were destroyed with the Dabur (westerly wind).) Allah saying,  وَفِى ثَمُودَ إِذْ قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَمَتَّعُواْ حَتَّى حِينٍ  (And in Thamud, when they were told: \"Enjoy yourselves for a while!\") is just as He said in another Ayah,  وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَـهُمْ فَاسْتَحَبُّواْ الْعَمَى عَلَى الْهُدَى فَأَخَذَتْهُمْ صَـعِقَةُ الْعَذَابِ الْهُونِ  (And as for Thamud, We guided them to the path of truth, but they preferred blindness to guidance; so the Sa`iqah of disgracing torment seized them.) (41:17) Allah said here,  وَفِى ثَمُودَ إِذْ قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَمَتَّعُواْ حَتَّى حِينٍ - فَعَتَوْاْ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهِمْ فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّاعِقَةُ وَهُمْ يَنظُرُونَ  (And in Thamud, when they were told: \"Enjoy yourselves for a while!\" But they insolently defied the command of their Lord, so the Sa`iqah overtook them while they were looking.) Thamud were given a respite for three days, during which they await the torment. In the early morning of the fourth day, the torment overtook them,  فَمَا اسْتَطَـعُواْ مِن قِيَامٍ  (Then they were unable to rise up,) they were unable to escape and run away from it,  وَمَا كَانُواْ مُنتَصِرِينَ  (nor could they help themselves.) nor could they save themselves from the torment that befell them. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,  وَقَوْمَ نُوحٍ مِّن قَبْلُ  ((So were) the people of Nuh before them.) meaning, `We destroyed the people of Nuh before these people (Fir`awn, `Ad and Thamud).'  إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ  (Verily, they were a people who were revellious.) We mentioned these stories in details before in the Tafsir of several other Surahs. "

  51,51,"<h2>Proofs of Allah's Oneness abound in the Creation of the Heavens and the Earth</h2> Allah reminds us of the creating of the higher and lower worlds, ﴾وَالسَّمَآءَ بَنَيْنَـهَا﴿ (We constructed the heaven.) meaning, `We made it as a high roof, protected from falling,' ﴾بِأَيْدٍ﴿ (with Hands), meaning, with strength, according to `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ath-Thawri and several others, ﴾وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ﴿ (Verily, We are able to extend the vastness of space thereof.) means, `We made it vast and We brought its roof higher without pillars to support it, and thus it is hanging independently.' ﴾وَالاٌّرْضَ فَرَشْنَـهَا﴿ (And We have made the earth a Firash), meaning, `We have made it a resting place for the created,' ﴾فَنِعْمَ الْمَـهِدُونَ﴿ (how excellent a spreader (thereof) are We!), meaning, `We spread it for its inhabitants,' ﴾وَمِن كُلِّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَا زَوْجَيْنِ﴿ (And of everything We have created pairs,) meaning, all the created are in pairs, the heaven and earth, night and day, sun and moon, land and sea, light and darkness, faith and disbelief, death and life, misery and happiness, Paradise and Fire, in addition to the animals and plants. The statement of Allah the Exalted, ﴾لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ﴿ (that you may remem- ber.) and know that the Creator, Allah, is One without partners, ﴾فَفِرُّواْ إِلَى اللَّهِ﴿ (So, flee to Allah.) meaning, seek shelter with Him and trust in Him in all of your affairs, ﴾إِنِّى لَكُمْ مِّنْهُ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌوَلاَ تَجْعَلُواْ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهاً ءَاخَرَ﴿ (Verily, I am a plain warner to you from Him. And set not up any other god along with Allah.) do not associate any partners with Him, ﴾إِنِّى لَكُمْ مِّنْهُ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ﴿ (Verily, I am a plain warner to you from Him.) "
