  20,101,"<h2>The Entire Qur'an is the Remembrance of Allah and mentioning thePunishment of Those Who turn away from It</h2> Allah, the Exalted, is saying to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, `We have told you (O Muhammad) the story of Musa and what happened with him, Fir`awn and his armies, just as it actually happened. Likewise, We relate to you the information of the past just as it happened, without any increase or decrease. We also gave you a remembrance from Us, the Mighty Qur'an, no falsehood comes to it from before it or behind it.' It is a revelation from One Most Wise, Most Praiseworthy. No Prophet was given any Book like it or more complete than it, since the time of the previous Prophets who were sent, until their being sealed off with the coming of Muhammad ﷺ. No Prophet was given any Book containing as much information than the Qur'an about what has past and what would be. The judgement concerning the distinction between mankind is taken from it. Therefore, Allah says about it,  مَّنْ أَعْرَضَ عَنْهُ  (Whoever turns away from it,) This means whoever denies it and turns away from following its commands and instructions, while seeking guidance from other than it, then Allah will mislead him and send him on the path to Hell. This is why Allah says,  مَّنْ أَعْرَضَ عَنْهُ فَإِنَّهُ يَحْمِلُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ وِزْراً  (Whoever turns away from it, verily, they will bear a heavy burden on the Day of Resurrection.) .Burden here means sin. This is as Allah says,  وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ  (But those of the sects that reject it , the Fire will be their promised meeting place.) 11:17 This applies generally to whoever the Qur'an reaches of the Arabs, the non-Arabs, the People of the Book and others. This is as Allah says,  لاٌّنذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ  (That I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach.) 6:19 The Qur'an is a final warning for everyone it reaches. Whoever follows it, then he is rightly guided and whoever opposes it and turns away from it, then he is misguided. He will be wretched in this life, and he is promised that on the Day of Resurrection his abode will be the Hellfire. For this reason Allah says,  مَّنْ أَعْرَضَ عَنْهُ فَإِنَّهُ يَحْمِلُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ وِزْراً خَـلِدِينَ فِيهِ  (Whoever turns away from it, verily, they will bear a heavy burden on the Day of Resurrection. They will abide in that.) 20:100-101 They will not be able to avoid this or escape it.  وَسَآءَ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ حِمْلاً  (And evil indeed will it be that load for them on the Day of Resurrection.)

  20,104,"<h2>The Blowing of the Sur and the Day of Resurrection</h2> It has been confirmed in a Hadith that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked about the Sur and he replied,  «قَرْنٌ يُنْفَخُ فِيه»  (It is a horn that will be blown into.) It has been related in a Hadith about the Sur, on the authority of Abu Hurayrah that it is a huge horn that has a circumference as large as the heavens and the earth. The angel Israfil will blow into it. Another Hadith has been related which states that the Prophet said,  «كَيْفَ أَنْعَمُ وَصَاحِبُ الْقَرْنِ قَدِ الْتقَمَ الْقَرْنَ وَحَنَى جَبْهَتَهُ، وَانْتَظَرَ أَنْ يُؤْذَنَ لَه»  (How can I be comfortable when the one with the horn is holding it in his lips and his forehead is leaning forward, waiting to be given permission (to blow it).) The people said, \"O Messenger of Allah, what should we say\" He said,  «قُولُوا: حَسْبُنَا اللهُ وَنِعْمَ الْوَكِيلُ عَلَى اللهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا»  (Say: Allah is sufficient for us and what a good protector He is. Upon Allah we place our trust.) Concerning His statement,  وَنَحْشُرُ الْمُجْرِمِينَ يَوْمِئِذٍ زُرْقاً  (And We shall gather the criminals blue-eyed.) It has been said that this means having blue eyes due to the severity of their horrifying situation.  يَتَخَـفَتُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ  (They will speak in a very low voice to each other. ) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means whispering among themselves.\" This means that some of them will be saying to others,  إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ عَشْراً  (You stayed not longer than ten.) meaning in the abode of the worldly life, you only tarried there for a little while. The time was equivalent to ten days or so. Allah, the Exalted, then says,  نَّحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَقُولُونَ  (We know very well what they will say,) This means in their condition of conversing amongst themselves.  إِذْ يَقُولُ أَمْثَلُهُمْ طَرِيقَةً  (when the best among them in knowledge and wisdom will say;) the one with perfect intelligence amongst them,  إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ يَوْماً  (You stayed no longer than a day!) This is because on the Day of Judgement they will sense the shortness of the worldly life within themselves. For the worldly life, with its repetitious time periods and successive nights, days and hours, is as if it is just one day. For this reason, on the Day of Resurrection the disbelievers will think the worldly life was very short. By this they mean to prevent the establishment of the evidence against them due to the shortness of time that they had. Allah says about this,  وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ يُقْسِمُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ مَا لَبِثُواْ غَيْرَ سَاعَةٍ  (And on the Day that the Hour will be established, the criminals will swear that they stayed not but an hour) until His statement,  وَلَـكِنَّكُمْ كُنتمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ  (but you knew not.\") 30:55-56 Allah also says,  أَوَلَمْ نُعَمِّرْكُمْ مَّا يَتَذَكَّرُ فِيهِ مَن تَذَكَّرَ وَجَآءَكُمُ النَّذِيرُ  (Did We not give you lives long enough, so that whosoever would receive admonition could receive it And the warner came to you.) 35:37 Allah, the Exalted, also says,  قَـلَ كَمْ لَبِثْتُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ عَدَدَ سِنِينَ - قَالُواْ لَبِثْنَا يَوْماً أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ فَاسْأَلِ الْعَآدِّينَ - قَالَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً لَّوْ أَنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ  ((Allah will say): What number of years did you stay on earth They will say: \"We stayed a day or part of a day. Ask of those who keep account.\" He (Allah) will say: \"You stayed not but a little, if you had only known!\") 23:112-114 This means that you only remained in it (the earth) a little while. If you only knew, you would have preferred the eternal life over the temporal life. Yet, you conducted yourselves in an evil manner. You gave the present, temporary life precedence over the eternal and everlasting life. "

  20,108,"<h2>The destruction of the Mountains, and the Earth becomes a Smooth Plain</h2> Allah says,  ﴾وَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ﴿ (And they ask you concerning the mountains.) This is a question, will they remain on the Day of Resurrection or will they cease to exist  ﴾فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً﴿ (Say: \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") This means that He will take them away from their places, wipe them out and remove them completely.  ﴾فَيَذَرُهَا﴿ (Then He shall leave it) referring to the earth;  ﴾قَاعاً صَفْصَفاً﴿ (as a level smooth plain.) This means one expanse spread out. The word Qa` means a piece of land that is level and the word Safsafa is used to place emphasis on this meaning. It has also been said that Safsafa means that which has no vegetation growing in it. The first meaning is preferred, even though the second meaning is also included by necessity. In reference to this, Allah says,  ﴾لاَّ تَرَى فِيهَا عِوَجاً وَلا أَمْتاً ﴿ (You will see therein no crookedness nor curve. ) meaning, `on that Day you will not see in the earth any valley, hill, or any place, whether low or elevated.' Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and others of the Salaf all said the same.  <h2>The People will rush towards the Voice of the Caller</h2>﴾يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَّبِعُونَ الدَّاعِىَ لاَ عِوَجَ لَهُ﴿ (On that Day mankind will follow strictly Allah's caller, no crookedness will they show him.) On the Day, they see these conditions and these frightening sights, they will hastily respond to the caller. Wherever they are commanded to go, they will rush to it. If they had been like this in the worldly life, it would have been more beneficial for them, but here it does not benefit them. This is as Allah says,  ﴾أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا﴿ (How clearly will they see and hear, the Day when they will appear before Us!) 19:38 Allah also says,  ﴾مُّهْطِعِينَ إِلَى الدَّاعِ﴿ (hastening towards the caller.) Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾وَخَشَعَتِ الأَصْوَاتُ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ﴿ (And all voices will be humbled for the Most Gracious,) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means they will be silent.\" As-Suddi also said the same.  ﴾فَلاَ تَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ هَمْساً﴿ (And nothing shall you hear except Hamsa.) Sa`id bin Jubayr related that Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means the steps of feet.\" `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Qatadah, Ibn Zayd and others all said the same. `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said,  ﴾فَلاَ تَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ هَمْساً﴿ (And nothing shall you hear except Hamsa.) \"Hamsa means a hidden voice.\" This has also been repor- ted from `Ikrimah and Ad-Dahhak. Sa`id bin Jubayr said,  ﴾فَلاَ تَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ هَمْساً﴿ (And nothing shall you hear except Hamsa.) \"Hamsa means the secret speech and the steps of feet.\"  "

  20,112,"<h2>The Intercession and the Recompense</h2> Allah, the Exalted, says,  ﴾يَوْمَئِذٍ﴿ (On that day) the Day of Resurrection,  ﴾لاَّ تَنفَعُ الشَّفَاعَةُ﴿ (no intercession shall avail.) meaning with Him (Allah).  ﴾إِلاَّ مَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَرَضِىَ لَهُ قَوْلاً﴿ (except the one for whom the Most Gracious has given permission and whose word is acceptable to Him.) This is similar to His statement,  ﴾مَن ذَا الَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ﴿ (Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His permission) 2:255 It is also similar to His statement,  ﴾وَكَمْ مِّن مَّلَكٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ لاَ تُغْنِى شَفَـعَتُهُمْ شَيْئاً إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ أَن يَأْذَنَ اللَّهُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَرْضَى ﴿ (And there are many angels in the heavens, whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with.) 53:26 He also says,  ﴾وَلاَ يَشْفَعُونَ إِلاَّ لِمَنِ ارْتَضَى وَهُمْ مِّنْ خَشْيَتِهِ مُشْفِقُونَ﴿ (And they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased. And they stand in awe for fear of Him.) 21:28 He also says,  ﴾وَلاَ تَنفَعُ الشَّفَـعَةُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ لِمَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ﴿ (Intercession with Him profits not except for him whom He permits.) 34:23 And He says,  ﴾يَوْمَ يَقُومُ الرُّوحُ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةُ صَفّاً لاَّ يَتَكَلَّمُونَ إِلاَّ مَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَقَالَ صَوَاباً ﴿ (The Day that Ar-Ruh and the angels will stand forth in rows, they will not speak except him whom the Most Gracious allows, and he will speak what is right.) 78:38 In the Two Sahihs it is reported from the leader of the Children of Adam and the Noblest of all the creatures to Allah, Muhammad :  ﴾«آتِي تَحْتَ الْعَرْشِ، وَأَخِرُّ للهِ سَاجِدًا، وَيَفْتَحُ عَلَيَّ بِمَحَامِدَ لَا أُحْصِيهَا الْآنَ، فَيَدَعُنِي مَا شَاءَ أَنْ يَدَعَنِي، ثُمَّ يَقُولُ: يَا مُحَمَّدُ، ارْفَعْ رَأْسَكَ وَقُلْ يُسْمَعْ، وَاشْفَعْ تُشَفَّعْ فَيَحُدُّ لِي حَدًّا، فَأُدْخِلُهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ ثُمَّ أَعُود»﴿ (I will come under the Throne and I will fall down into prostration. Then, I will be inspired to make praises (of Allah) that I am not able to recall them now. Allah will leave me in this condition as long as He wishes. Then, He will say, \"O Muhammad, raise your head. Speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted.\" Then, a designated group will be allowed for me (to intercede on their behalf). Allah will then enter them into Paradise and I will return (to repeat the process again). ) The Prophet mentioned doing this four times. May Allah's blessings and peace be upon him and the rest of the Prophets as well. In another Hadith it also mentions that he said,  ﴾«يَقُولُ تَعَالَى: أَخْرِجُوا مِنَ النَّارِ مَنْ كَانَ فِي قَلْبِهِ مِثْقَالُ حَبَّةٍ مِنْ إِيمَانٍ، فَيُخْرِجُونَ خَلْقًا كَثِيرًا، ثُمَّ يَقُولُ: أَخْرِجُوا مِنَ النَّارِ مَنْ كَانَ فِي قَلْبِهِ نِصْفُ مِثْقَالٍ مِنْ إِيمَانٍ، أَخْرِجُوا مِنَ النَّارِ مَنْ كَانَ فِي قَلْبِهِ مَا يَزِنُ ذَرَّةً، مَنْ كَانَ فِي قَلْبِهِ أَدْنَى أَدْنَى مِثْقَالِ ذَرَّةٍ مِنْ إِيمَان»﴿ (Allah, the Exalted, will say, \"Bring out of the Fire whoever has a seed's weight of faith in his heart.\" So a large number of people will be brought out. Then He will say, \"Bring out of the Fire whoever has a half of a seed's weight of faith in his heart. Bring out whoever has the weight of a speck of dust in his heart. Bring out whoever has the weight of the smallest and tiniest particle of dust of faith in his heart.\") And the Hadith continues. Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ﴿ (He knows what happens to them and what will happen to them,) He encompasses all creation with His knowledge.  ﴾وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْماً﴿ (but they will never encompass anything of His knowledge.) This is like His statement,  ﴾وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلاَّ بِمَا شَآءَ﴿ (And they will never encompass anything of His knowledge except that which He wills. ) 2:255 Concerning Allah's statement,  ﴾وَعَنَتِ الْوُجُوهُ لِلْحَىِّ الْقَيُّومِ﴿ (And (all) faces shall be humbled before the Ever Living, the Sustainer.) Ibn `Abbas and others said, \"This means that the creatures will be humbled, submissive and compliant to their Compeller, the Ever Living, Who does not die, the Sustainer of all, Who does not sleep.\" He is the maintainer of everything. He determines the affairs of everything and preserves everything. He is perfect in His Self. He is the One Whom everything is in need of and whom nothing could survive without. Concerning His statement,  ﴾وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنْ حَمَلَ ظُلْماً﴿ (And he who carried wrongdoing, will be indeed a complete failure.) meaning on the Day of Resurrection. For verily, Allah will give every due right to the one who deserved it. Even the ram who lost its horn will be given revenge against the one who had horns. In the Sahih, it is recorded that the Prophet said,  ﴾«إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظُّلْمَ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»﴿ (Beware of wrongdoing (or oppression), for verily, wrongdoing will be darknesses on the Day of Resurrection.) And the true failure is for whoever meets Allah while associating partners with Him. Allah the Exalted says,  ﴾إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ﴿ (\"Verily, associating partners with Me is the great wrongdoing.\") Allah's statement,  ﴾وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِنَ الصَّـلِحَـتِ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلاَ يَخَافُ ظُلْماً وَلاَ هَضْماً ﴿ (And he who works deeds of righteousness, while he is a believer, then he will have no fear of injustice, nor of any curtailment.) After Allah mentions the wrongdoers and their threat, He then commends the pious people and mentions the judgement they receive. Their judgement is that they will not be wronged nor oppressed. This means that their evils will not be increased and their good deeds will not be decreased. This was stated by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others. Zulm means an increase that comes from the sins of others being placed upon the person, and Hadm means a decrease.  "
