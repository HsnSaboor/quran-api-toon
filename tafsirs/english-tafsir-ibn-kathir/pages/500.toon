  45,15,"<h2>The Subjugation of the Sea, etc., is among Allah's Signs</h2> Allah the Exalted mentions some of the favors He gave to His servants, such as subjecting the sea for their service, ﴾لِتَجْرِىَ الْفُلْكُ فِيهِ بِأَمْرِهِ﴿ (that ships may sail through the sea by His command,) i.e., of Allah the Exalted, Who ordered the sea to carry ships, ﴾وَلِتَبْتَغُواْ مِن فَضْلِهِ﴿ (and that you may seek of His bounty,) in commercial and business transactions, ﴾وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ﴿ (and that you may be thankful.) for earning various provisions brought to you from far away provinces and distant areas through the sea. Allah the Exalted said, ﴾وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمْ مَّا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ﴿ (And has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth;) the stars, the mountains, the seas, the rivers and all that you use for your benefit; these are all from His favor, kindness and bounty. Allah's statement next, ﴾جَمِيعاً مِّنْهُ﴿ (it is all from Him.) Alone without partners in giving any of it. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah, ﴾وَمَا بِكُم مِّن نِّعْمَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ إِذَا مَسَّكُمُ الضُّرُّ فَإِلَيْهِ تَجْـَرُونَ ﴿ (And whatever of blessings you have, it is from Allah. Then, when harm touches you unto Him you cry aloud for help.) (16:53) Ibn Jarir recorded that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement, ﴾وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمْ مَّا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ جَمِيعاً مِّنْهُ﴿ (And has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth; it is all from Him.) \"Everything is from Allah, and that is a Name from His Names. So it all comes from Him without rivals to dispute His authority; surely, this fact is completely certain.\" Allah said. ﴾إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ﴿ (Verily, in it are signs for a people who think deeply.) <h2>The Command to be Patient with the Harm of Idolators</h2> Allah's saying; ﴾قُل لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ يَغْفِرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ لاَ يَرْجُونَ أَيَّامَ اللَّهِ﴿ (Say to the believers to forgive those who hope not for the Days of Allah,) means, let the believers forgive the disbelievers and endure the harm that they direct against them. In the beginning of Islam, Muslims were ordered to observe patience in the face of the oppression of the idolators and the People of the Scriptures so that their hearts may incline towards Islam. However, when the disbelievers persisted in stubbornness, Allah legislated for the believers to fight in Jihad. Statements of this meaning were collected from `Abdullah bin `Abbas and Qatadah. Mujahid said about Allah's statement, ﴾لاَ يَرْجُونَ أَيَّامَ اللَّهِ﴿ (those who hope not for the Days of Allah,) \"They do not appreciate Allah's favors.\" Allah said, ﴾لِيَجْزِىَ قَوْماً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ﴿ (that He may recompense people, according to what they have earned.) meaning, if the believers forgive the disbelievers in this life, Allah will still punish the disbelievers for their evil in the Hereafter. Allah's statement next, ﴾مَنْ عَمِلَ صَـلِحاً فَلِنَفْسِهِ وَمَنْ أَسَآءَ فَعَلَيْهَا ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّكُمْ تُرْجَعُونَ ﴿ (Whosoever does a good deed, it is for himself, and whosoever does evil, it is against (himself). Then to your Lord you will be made to return.) meaning, you will all return to Allah on the Day of Resurrection, when you and your actions will be displayed before Him. Then, He will recompense you for your deeds, good for good and evil for evil. ﴾وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ الْكِتَـبَ وَالْحُكْمَ وَالنُّبُوَّةَ وَرَزَقْنَـهُمْ مِّنَ الطَّيِّبَـتِ وَفَضَّلْنَـهُمْ عَلَى الْعَـلَمينَ - وَءاتَيْنَـهُم بَيِّنَـتٍ مِّنَ الاٌّمْرِ فَمَا اخْتَلَفُواْ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ الْعِلْمُ بَغْياً بَيْنَهُمْ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَقْضِى بِيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فِيمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ - ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَـكَ عَلَى شَرِيعَةٍ مِّنَ الاٌّمْرِ فَاتَّبِعْهَا وَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَ الَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ ﴿"

  45,20,"<h2>Preference of Allah to the Children of Israel and their dispute thereafter</h2> Allah the Exalted mentions the favors He granted the Children of Israel, such as revealing the Divine Books to them, sending the Messengers to them and granting them kingship. Allah said, ﴾وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ الْكِتَـبَ وَالْحُكْمَ وَالنُّبُوَّةَ وَرَزَقْنَـهُمْ مِّنَ الطَّيِّبَـتِ﴿ (And indeed We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture, and the understanding of the Scripture and its laws, and the prophethood; and provided them with good things,) such as foods and drinks, ﴾وَفَضَّلْنَـهُمْ عَلَى الْعَـلَمينَ﴿ (and preferred them above the nations.) of their time, ﴾وَءاتَيْنَـهُم بَيِّنَـتٍ مِّنَ الاٌّمْرِ﴿ (And gave them clear proofs in matters.) `We gave them evidences, proofs and unequivocal signs.' Therefore, the proof has been established against them, yet they differed among themselves after the proof came to them, out of transgression against each other, ﴾إِنَّ رَبَّكَ﴿ (Verily, your Lord) `O Muhammad', ﴾يَقْضِى بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فِيمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ﴿ (will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they used to differ. ) He will judge between them by His just judgement. <h2>Warning to this Ummah against following the Ways of the Children of Israel</h2> This Ayah contains a warning to the Muslim Ummah as well. It warns them not to take the path the Jews took nor adopt their ways. This is why Allah said, ﴾ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَـكَ عَلَى شَرِيعَةٍ مِّنَ الاٌّمْرِ فَاتَّبِعْهَا﴿ (Then We have put you on a (legal) way of commandment. So follow you that.) `follow what was revealed to you from your Lord, O Muhammad, there is no true deity except Him, and turn away from the idolators.' Allah said, ﴾وَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَ الَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَإِنَّهُمْ لَن يُغْنُواْ عَنكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئاً وَإِنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ﴿ (and follow not the desires of those who know not. Verily, they can avail you nothing against Allah. Verily, the wrongdoers are protecting friends of one another,) Allah says, `what will the loyalty that the idolators give each other avail them' Indeed, all they will earn from their protecting friends is more loss, destruction and demise, ﴾وَاللَّهُ وَلِىُّ الْمُتَّقِينَ﴿ (but Allah is the Protector of those who have Taqwa.) and He will deliver them from the darkness to the light. In contrast, all the false deities are the protecting friends of those who disbelieve, taking them out of the light to the darkness. Allah said, ﴾هَـذَا بَصَـئِرُ لِلنَّاسِ﴿ (This is a clear insight and evidence for man- kind,) in reference to the Qur'an, ﴾وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ﴿ (and a guidance and a mercy for people who have faith with certainty.)
