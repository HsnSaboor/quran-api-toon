tafsir[7]{c,v,t}:
  7,31,"<h2>Allah commands taking Adornment when going to the Masjid</h2> This honorable Ayah refutes the idolators' practice of performing Tawaf around the Sacred House while naked. Muslim, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Jarir, (the following wording is that of Ibn Jarir) recorded that Shu`bah said that Salamah bin Kuhayl said that Muslim Al-Batin said that Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The idolators used to go around the House while naked, both men and women, men in the day and women by night. The woman would say, \"Today, a part or all of it will be unveiled, but whatever is exposed of it, I do not allow.\" Allah said in reply,  خُذُواْ زِينَتَكُمْ عِندَ كُلِّ مَسْجِدٍ  (Take your adornment to every Masjid,) Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas commented on:  خُذُواْ زِينَتَكُمْ عِندَ كُلِّ مَسْجِدٍ  (Take your adornment to every Masjid) o\"There were people who used to perform Tawaf around the House while naked, and Allah ordered them to take adornment, meaning, wear clean, proper clothes that cover the private parts. people were commanded to wear their best clothes when performing every prayer.\" Mujahid, `Ata', Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ad-Dahhak and Malik narrated a similar saying from Az-Zuhri, and from several of the Salaf. They said that this Ayah was revealed about the idolators who used to perform Tawaf around the House while naked. This Ayah (7:31), as well as the Sunnah, encourage wearing the best clothes when praying, especially for Friday and `Id prayers. It is also recommended for men to wear perfume for prayer, because it is adornment, and to use Siwak for it is part of what completes adornment. The best color for clothes is white, for Imam Ahmad narrated that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «الْبَسُوا مِنْ ثِيَابِكُمُ الْبَيَاضَ فَإِنَّهَا مِنْ خَيْرِ ثِيَابِكُمْ، وَكَفِّنُوا فِيهَا مَوْتَاكُمْ وَإِنَّ خَيْرَ أَكْحَالِكُمُ الْإثْمَدُ فَإِنَّهُ يَجْلُو الْبَصَرَ وَيُنْبِتُ الشَّعَر»  (Wear white clothes, for it is among your best clothes, and also wrap your dead with it. And Ithmid (antimony) is among the best of your Kuhl, for it clears the sight and helps the hair grow.) This Hadith has a sound chain of narration, consisting of narrators who conform to the conditions and guidelines of Imam Muslim. Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah also recorded it, and At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" <h2>Prohibiting Extravagance</h2> Allah said,  وَكُلُواْ وَاشْرَبُواْ  (And eat and drink..). Al-Bukhari said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Eat what you wish and wear what you wish, as long as you avoid two things: extravagance and arrogance.\" Ibn Jarir said that Muhammad bin `Abdul-A`la narrated to us that Muhammad bin Thawr narrated to us from Ma`mar from Ibn Tawus from his father who said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Allah has allowed eating and drinking, as long as it does not contain extravagance or arrogance.\" This chain is Sahih. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Miqdam bin Ma`dikarib Al-Kindi said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,  «مَا مَلَأَ ابْنُ آدَمَ وِعَاءً شَرًّا مِنْ بَطْنِهِ بِحَسْبِ ابْنِ آدَمَ أَكَلَاتٍ يُقِمْنَ صُلْبَهُ فَإِنْ كَانَ فَاعِلًا لَا مَحَالَةَ فَثُلُثٌ طَعَامٌ وَثُلُثٌ شَرَابٌ وَثُلُثٌ لِنَفَسِه»  (The Son of Adam will not fill a pot worse for himself than his stomach. It is enough for the Son of Adam to eat a few bites that strengthens his spine. If he likes to have more, then let him fill a third with food, a third with drink and leave a third for his breathing.) An-Nasa'i and At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith, At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan\" or \"Hasan Sahih\" according to another manuscript. `Ata' Al-Khurasani said that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah,  وكُلُواْ وَاشْرَبُواْ وَلاَ تُسْرِفُواْ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْمُسْرِفِينَ  (And eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allah) likes not the wasteful.) \"With food and drink.\" Ibn Jarir commented on Allah's statement,  إِنَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْمُسْرِفِينَ  (Certainly He (Allah) likes not the wasteful.) \"Allah the Exalted says that He does not like those who trespass the limits on an allowed matter or a prohibited matter, those who go to the extreme over what He has allowed, allow what He has prohibited, or prohibit what He has allowed. But, He likes that what He has allowed be considered as such (without extravagance) and what He has prohibited be considered as such. This is the justice that He has commanded.\" "
  7,32,"<h2>Allah refutes those who prohibit any type of food, drink or clothesaccording to their own understanding, without relying on whatAllah has legislated,</h2>﴾قُلْ﴿ (Say) O Muhammad, to the idolators who prohibit some things out of false opinion and fabrication,  ﴾مَنْ حَرَّمَ زِينَةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى أَخْرَجَ لِعِبَادِهِ﴿ (Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allah, which He has produced for His servants) meaning, these things were created for those who believe in Allah and worship Him in this life, even though the disbelievers share in these bounties in this life. In the Hereafter, the believers will have all this to themselves and none of the disbelievers will have a share in it, for Paradise is prohibited for the disbelievers.  "
  7,33,"<h2>Fahishah, Sin, Transgression, Shirk and Lying about Allah are prohibited</h2> Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «لَا أَحَدَ أَغْيَرُ مِنَ اللهِ فَلِذَلِكَ حَرَّمَ الْفَوَاحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ، وَلَا أَحَدَ أَحَبُّ إِلَيْهِ الْمَدْحُ مِنَ الله»  (None is more jealous than Allah, and this is why He prohibited Fawahish, committed openly or in secret. And none likes praise more than Allah). This was also recorded in the Two Sahihs. In the explanation of Surat Al-An`am, we explained the Fahishah that is committed openly and in secret. Allah said next,  وَالإِثْمَ وَالْبَغْىَ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ  (and Ithm, and transgression without right,) 7:33. As-Suddi commented, \"Al-Ithm means, `disobedience'. As for unrighteous oppression, it occurs when you transgress against people without justification.\" Mujahid said, \"Ithm includes all types of disobedience. Allah said that the oppressor commits oppression against himself.\" Therefore, the meaning of, Ithm is the sin that one commits against himself, while `oppression' pertains to transgression against other people, and Allah prohibited both. Allah's statement,  وَأَن تُشْرِكُواْ بِاللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ سُلْطَـناً  (and joining partners with Allah for which He has given no authority, ) prohibits calling partners with Allah in worship.  وَأَن تَقُولُواْ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ  (and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge.) such as lies and inventions, like claiming that Allah has a son, and other evil creeds that you -- O idolators -- have no knowledge of. This is similar to His saying:  فَاجْتَنِبُواْ الرِّجْسَ مِنَ الاٌّوْثَـنِ  (So shun the abomination (worshipping) of the idols) 22:30. "

  7,36,"﴾وَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ﴿ (And every Ummah has), meaning, each generation and nation,  ﴾أَجَلٌ فَإِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهُمْ﴿ (its appointed term; when their term comes) which they were destined for,  ﴾لاَ يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ سَاعَةً وَلاَ يَسْتَقْدِمُونَ﴿ (neither can they delay it nor can they advance it an hour (or a moment)). Allah then warned the Children of Adam that He sent to them Messengers who conveyed to them His Ayat. Allah also conveyed good news, as well as warning,  ﴾فَمَنِ اتَّقَى وَأَصْلَحَ﴿ (then whosoever has Taqwa and becomes righteous) by abandoning the prohibitions and performing acts of obedience,  ﴾فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَوَالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ عَنْهَآ﴿ (on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve. But those who reject Our Ayat and treat them with arrogance,) meaning, their hearts denied the Ayat and they were too arrogant to abide by them,  ﴾أُولَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ﴿ (they are the dwellers of the Fire, they will abide therein forever.) without end to their dwelling in it.  "
  7,37,"<h2>Idolators enjoy Their destined Share in This Life, but will lose Their Supporters upon Death</h2>Allah said,﴾فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَى عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِبًا أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِآيَـتِهِ﴿ (Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Ayat) meaning, none is more unjust than whoever invents a lie about Allah or rejects the Ayat that He has revealed. Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi said that,  ﴾أُوْلَـئِكَ يَنَالُهُمْ نَصِيبُهُم مِّنَ الْكِتَـبِ﴿ (For such their appointed portion will reach them from the Book) refers to each person's deeds, alloted provisions and age. Similar was said by Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. Allah said in similar statements,  ﴾قُلْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ لاَ يُفْلِحُونَ - مَتَـعٌ فِى الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ نُذِيقُهُمُ الْعَذَابَ الشَّدِيدَ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ ﴿ (Verily, those who invent a lie against Allah, will never be successful. (A brief) enjoyment in this world! And then unto Us will be their return, then We shall make them taste the severest torment because they used to disbelieve.) 10:69-70 and,  ﴾وَمَن كَفَرَ فَلاَ يَحْزُنكَ كُفْرُهُ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ فَنُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا عَمِلُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ نُمَتِّعُهُمْ قَلِيلاً﴿ (And whoever disbelieves, let not his disbelief grieve you. To Us is their return, and We shall inform them what they have done. Verily, Allah is the All-Knower of what is in the breasts (of men). We let them enjoy for a little while.) 31:23-24. Allah said next,  ﴾حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُنَا يَتَوَفَّوْنَهُمْ﴿ (until when Our messengers come to them to take their souls.) Allah states that when death comes to the idolators and the angels come to capture their souls to take them to Hellfire, the angels horrify them, saying, \"Where are the so-called partners (of Allah) whom you used to call in the life of this world, invoking and worshipping them instead of Allah Call them so that they save you from what you are suffering.\" However, the idolators will reply,  ﴾ضَـلُّواْ عَنَّا﴿ (\"They have vanished and deserted us\") meaning, we have lost them and thus, we do not hope in their benefit or aid,  ﴾وَشَهِدُواْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ﴿ (And they will bear witness against themselves) they will admit and proclaim against themselves,  ﴾أَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ كَـفِرِينَ﴿ (that they were disbelievers.)
