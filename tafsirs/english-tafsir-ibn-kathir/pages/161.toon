tafsir[6]{c,v,t}:
  7,82,"﴾إِنَّهُمْ أُنَاسٌ يَتَطَهَّرُونَ﴿ (\"These are indeed men who want to be pure (from sins)!\") Qatadah commented, \"They shamed them (Lut and the believers) with what is not a shame at all.\" Mujahid commented, \"(Lut's people said about Lut and the believers,) They are a people who want to be pure from men's anuses and women's anuses!\" Similar was narrated from Ibn `Abbas.  "

  7,84,"<h2>Allah says, We saved Lut and his family, for only his household believed in him.</h2> Allah said in another Ayah,  فَأَخْرَجْنَا مَن كَانَ فِيهَا مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ - فَمَا وَجَدْنَا فِيهَا غَيْرَ بَيْتٍ مِّنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ  (So We brought out from therein the believers. But We found not there any household of the Muslims except one of Lut and his daughters) 51: 35-36. Only his wife (from his family) did not believe, remaining on the religion of her people. She used to conspire with them against Lut and inform them of who came to visit him, using certain signals that they agreed on. This is why when Lut was commanded to leave by night with his family, he was ordered not to inform his wife or take her with him. Some said that she followed them, and when the torment struck her people, she looked back and suffered the same punishment as them. However, it appears that she did not leave the town and that Lut did not tell her that they would depart. So she remained with her people, as apparent from Allah's statement,  إِلاَّ امْرَأَتَهُ كَانَتْ مِنَ الْغَـبِرِينَ  (except his wife; she was of the Ghabirin) meaning, of those who remained, or they say: of those who were destroyed, and this is the more obvious explanation. Allah's statement,  وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ مَّطَرًا  (And We rained down on them a rain) is explained by His other statement,  وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهَا حِجَارَةً مِّن سِجِّيلٍ مَّنْضُودٍ  مُّسَوَّمَةً عِندَ رَبّكَ وَمَا هِى مِنَ الظَّـلِمِينَ بِبَعِيدٍ-  (And rained on them stones of baked clay, in a well-arranged manner one after another. Marked from your Lord; and they are not ever far from the wrongdoers.) 11:82-83. Allah said here,  فَانْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُجْرِمِينَ  (Then see what was the end of the criminals. ) This Ayah means: `See, O Muhammad, the end of those who dared to disobey Allah and reject His Messengers.' Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, all recorded a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas who said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said;  «مَنْ وَجَدْتُمُوهُ يَعْمَلُ عَمَلَ قَوْمِ لُوطٍ فَاقْتُلُوا الْفَاعِلَ وَالْمَفْعُول بِه»  (Whoever is found doing the act of the people of Lut, then kill them; the doer and the one it is done to.) "
  7,85,"<h2>Story of Shu`ayb, upon him be Peace, and the Land of Madyan</h2> Muhammad bin Ishaq said, \"They (the people of Madyan) are the descendents of Madyan, son of Midyan, son of Ibrahim. Shu`ayb was the son of Mikil bin Yashjur. And in the Syrian language, his name was Yathrun (Jethro)\". I (Ibn Kathir) say, Madyan was the name of the tribe and also a city that is close to Ma`an on route to the Hijaz (from Ash-Sham). Allah said in another Ayah,  ﴾وَلَمَّا وَرَدَ مَآءَ مَدْيَنَ وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّةً مِّنَ النَّاسِ يَسْقُونَ﴿ (And when he arrived at the water (a well) of Madyan he found there a group of men watering (their flocks).) 28:23 They are also the people of Al-Aykah (the Woods), as we will mention later on, Allah willing, and our trust is in Him.  ﴾قَالَ يَاقَوْمِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـهٍ غَيْرُهُ﴿ (He said: \"O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other God but Him\") and this is the call of all Messengers,  ﴾قَدْ جَآءَتْكُم بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ﴿ (\"Verily, a clear proof (sign) from your Lord has come unto you;\") meaning, `Allah has presented the proof and evidences of the truth of what I brought you.' He then advised them and commanded them to give full measure and full weight and not to wrong men in their dealings, meaning, to refrain from cheating people in buying and selling. They used to treacherously avoid giving full weight and measure. Allah said in other Ayat,  ﴾وَيْلٌ لِّلْمُطَفِّفِينَ ﴿ (Woe to Al-Mutaffifin (those who give less in measure and weight)...) 83:1 until He said,  ﴾لِرَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ﴿ (before the Lord of all that exists) 83:6. These Ayat contain a stern warning and sure promise that we ask Allah to save us from. Shu`ayb was called `Speaker of the Prophets', because of his eloquent words and eloquent advice, and Allah stated that Shu`ayb said:  "

  7,87,"<h2>Prophet Shu`ayb forbade his people from setting up blockades on the roads, saying,</h2>﴾وَلاَ تَقْعُدُواْ بِكُلِّ صِرَطٍ تُوعِدُونَ﴿ (\"And sit not on every road, threatening,\") threatening people with death if they do not give up their money, as they were bandits, according to As-Suddi. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several others commented:  ﴾وَلاَ تَقْعُدُواْ بِكُلِّ صِرَطٍ تُوعِدُونَ﴿ (\"And sit not on every road, threatening.\") the believers who come to Shu`ayb to follow him.\" The first meaning is better, because Prophet Shu`ayb first said to them,  ﴾بِكُلِّ صِرَطٍ﴿ (\"on every road...\") He then mentioned the second meaning,  ﴾وَتَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِهِ وَتَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا﴿ (\"and hindering from the path of Allah those who believe in Him, and seeking to make it crooked.\") meaning, you seek to make the path of Allah crooked and deviated,  ﴾وَاذْكُرُواْ إِذْ كُنتُمْ قَلِيلاً فَكَثَّرَكُمْ﴿ (\"And remember when you were but few, and He multiplied you.\") meaning, you were weak because you were few. But you later on became mighty because of your large numbers. Therefore, remember Allah's favor.  ﴾وَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُفْسِدِينَ﴿ (\"And see what was the end of the mischief-makers. \") from the previous nations and earlier generations. See the torment and punishment they suffered, because they disobeyed Allah and rejected His Messengers. Shu`ayb continued;  ﴾وَإِن كَانَ طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنكُمْ ءامَنُواْ بِالَّذِى أُرْسِلْتُ بِهِ وَطَآئِفَةٌ لَّمْ يْؤْمِنُواْ﴿ (\"And if there is a party of you who believes in that with which I have been sent and a party who does not believe,\") that is, if you divided concerning me,  ﴾فَاصْبِرُواْ﴿ (\"so be patient\") that is, then wait and see,  ﴾حَتَّى يَحْكُمَ اللَّهُ بَيْنَنَا﴿ (\"until Allah judges between us,\"), and you,  ﴾وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الْحَـكِمِينَ﴿ (\"and He is the best of judges.\") Surely, Allah will award the best end to those who fear and obey Him and He will destroy the disbelievers.
