  6,92,"<h2>The Messenger is but a Human to Whom the Book was Revealed by Inspiration</h2> Allah says that those who rejected His Messengers did not give Allah due consideration. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and `Abdullah bin Kathir said that this Ayah was revealed about the Quraysh. It was also said that it was revealed about some Jews.  قَالُواْ مَآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ عَلَى بَشَرٍ مِّن شَىْءٍ  (They said: \"Nothing did Allah send down to any human being (by inspiration).\") Allah also, said,  أَكَانَ لِلنَّاسِ عَجَبًا أَنْ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنْهُمْ أَنْ أَنذِرِ النَّاسَ  (Is it a wonder for mankind that We have inspired to a man from among themselves (saying): \"Warn mankind.\") 10:2, and,  وَمَا مَنَعَ النَّاسَ أَن يُؤْمِنُواْ إِذْ جَآءَهُمُ الْهُدَى إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ أَبَعَثَ اللَّهُ بَشَرًا رَّسُولاً - قُل لَوْ كَانَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ مَلَـئِكَةٌ يَمْشُونَ مُطْمَئِنِّينَ لَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ مَلَكًا رَّسُولاً  (And nothing prevented men from believing when the guidance came to them, except that they said: \"Has Allah sent a man as Messenger\" Say: \"If there were on the earth, angels walking about in peace and security, We should certainly have sent down for them from the heaven an angel as a Messenger.\") 17:94-95. Allah said here,  وَمَا قَدَرُواْ اللَّهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ إِذْ قَالُواْ مَآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ عَلَى بَشَرٍ مِّن شَىْءٍ  (They did not estimate Allah with an estimation due to Him when they said: \"Nothing did Allah send down to any human being (by inspiration).\") Allah answered them,  قُلْ مَنْ أَنزَلَ الْكِتَـبَ الَّذِى جَآءَ بِهِ مُوسَى نُوراً وَهُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ  (Say : \"Who then sent down the Book which Musa brought, a light and a guidance to mankind\") meaning, say, O Muhammad , to those who deny the concept that Allah sent down Books by revelation, answering them specifically,  مَنْ أَنزَلَ الْكِتَـبَ الَّذِى جَآءَ بِهِ مُوسَى  (Who then sent down the Book which Musa brought) in reference to the Tawrah that you and all others know that Allah sent down to Musa, son of `Imran. Allah sent the Tawrah as a light and a guidance for people, so that it could shed light on the answers to various disputes, and to guide away from the darkness of doubts. Allah's statement, .  تَجْعَلُونَهُ قَرَطِيسَ تُبْدُونَهَا وَتُخْفُونَ كَثِيراً  (which you have made into (separate) papersheets, disclosing (some of it) and concealing (much).) means, you made the Tawrah into separate sheets which you copied from the original and altered, changed and distorted as you wished. You then said, \"this is from Allah,\" meaning it is in the revealed Book of Allah, when in fact, it is not from Allah. This is why Allah said here,  تَجْعَلُونَهُ قَرَطِيسَ تُبْدُونَهَا وَتُخْفُونَ كَثِيراً  (which you have made into (separate) papersheets, disclosing (some of it) and concealing (much).) Allah said;  وَعُلِّمْتُمْ مَّا لَمْ تَعْلَمُواْ أَنتُمْ وَلاَ ءَابَاؤُكُمْ  (And you were taught that which neither you nor your fathers knew.) meaning, Who sent down the Qur'an in which Allah taught you the news of those who were before you and the news of what will come after, that neither you nor your fathers had knowledge of. Allah's statement,  قُلِ اللَّهُ  (Say: \"Allah.\") `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Meaning, `Say, Allah sent it down.\"' Allah said,  ثُمَّ ذَرْهُمْ فِى خَوْضِهِمْ يَلْعَبُونَ  (Then leave them to play in their vain discussions.) leave them to play in ignorance and misguidance until the true news comes to them from Allah. Then, they will know whether the good end is theirs or for the fearful servants of Allah. Allah said,  وَهَـذَا كِتَـبٌ  (And this is a Book,) the Qur'an,  أَنزَلْنَـهُ مُبَارَكٌ مُّصَدِّقُ الَّذِى بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَلِتُنذِرَ أُمَّ الْقُرَى  (Blessed, which We have sent down, confirming which came before it, so that you may warn the Mother of Towns) that is, Makkah,  وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا  (and all those around it...) refering to the Arabs and the rest of the children of Adam, Arabs and non-Arabs alike. Allah said in other Ayat,  قُلْ يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا  (Say: \"O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah.\") 7:158, and  لاٌّنذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ  (\"that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach.\") 6:19, and  وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ  (but those of the sects who reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place) 11:17 and,  تَبَارَكَ الَّذِى نَزَّلَ الْفُرْقَانَ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ لِيَكُونَ لِلْعَـلَمِينَ نَذِيراً  (Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion to His servant that he may be a warner to the `Alamin (mankind and Jinn).) 25:1, and,  وَقُلْ لِّلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ وَالاٍّمِّيِّينَ ءَأَسْلَمْتُمْ فَإِنْ أَسْلَمُواْ فَقَدِ اهْتَدَواْ وَّإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَـغُ وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِالْعِبَادِ  (And say to those who were given the Scripture and to those who are illiterates: \"Do you submit yourselves\" If they do, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the Message; and Allah is All-Seer of (His) servants.) 3:20. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «أُعْطِيتُ خَمْسًا لَمْ يُعْطَهُنَّ أَحَدٌ مِنَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ قَبْلِي»  (I have been given five things which were not given to any one else before me.) The Prophet mentioned among these five things,  «وَكَانَ النَّبِيُّ يُبْعَثُ إِلَى قَوْمِهِ خَاصَّةً، وَبُعِثْتُ إِلَى النَّاسِ عَامَّة»  (Every Prophet was sent only to his nation, but I have been sent to all people.) This is why Allah said,  وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالاٌّخِرَةِ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ  (Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it,) meaning, those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, believe in this blessed Book, the Qur'an, which We revealed to you, O Muhammad ,  وَهُمْ عَلَى صَلاَتِهِمْ يُحَافِظُونَ  (and they are constant in guarding their Salah.) for they perform what Allah ordered them, offering the prayers perfectly and on time.

  6,94,"<h2>None is Worse Than One who Invents a Lie Against Allah and Claims that Revelation Came to Him</h2> Allah said,  وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَى عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِباً  (And who can be more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah,) Therefore, none is more unjust than one who lies about Allah claiming that He has partners or a son, or falsely claiming that Allah sent him as a Prophet;  أَوْ قَالَ أُوْحِى إِلَىَّ وَلَمْ يُوحَ إِلَيْهِ شَىْءٌ  (or says: \"I have received inspiration,\" whereas he is not inspired with anything;) `Ikrimah and Qatadah said that this Ayah was revealed about Musaylimah Al-Kadhdhab.  وَمَن قَالَ سَأُنزِلُ مِثْلَ مَآ أَنَزلَ اللَّهُ  (and who says, \"I will reveal the like of what Allah has revealed.\") This refers to he, who claims that the lies he invents rival the revelation that came from Allah. In another Ayah, Allah said,  وَإِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتُنَا قَالُواْ قَدْ سَمِعْنَا لَوْ نَشَآءُ لَقُلْنَا مِثْلَ هَـذَآ  (And when Our verses (of the Qur'an) are recited to them, they say: \"We have heard this (the Qur'an); if we wish we can say the like of this.\") <h2>The Condition of These Unjust People Upon Death and on the Day of Resurrection</h2> Allah, the Most Honored, said,  وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الظَّـلِمُونَ فِى غَمَرَاتِ الْمَوْتِ  (And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the agonies of death...) suffering from the hardhips, agonies and afflictions of death,  وَالْمَلَـئِكَةُ بَاسِطُواْ أَيْدِيهِمْ  (while the angels are stretching forth their hands...) beating them. Allah said in other Ayat:  لَئِن بَسَطتَ إِلَىَّ يَدَكَ لِتَقْتُلَنِى  (If you do stretch your hand against me to kill me..) 5:28and,  وَيَبْسُطُواْ إِلَيْكُمْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ وَأَلْسِنَتَهُمْ بِالسُّوءِ  (And stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you with evil.)60:2 Ad-Dahhak and Abu Salih said that, `stretch forth their hands,' means, `with torment'. In another Ayah, Allah said,  وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ يَتَوَفَّى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ يَضْرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَأَدْبَـرَهُمْ  (And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve they smite their faces and their backs. )8:50 Allah said,  وَالْمَلَـئِكَةُ بَاسِطُواْ أَيْدِيهِمْ  (while the angels are stretching forth their hands) beating them, until their souls leave their bodies, saying,  أَخْرِجُواْ أَنفُسَكُمُ  (\"Deliver your souls!\") When the disbeliever is near death, the angels will convey the `good news' to him of torment, vengeance, chains, restraints, Hell, boiling water and the anger of the Most Beneficent, Most Merciful. The soul will then scatter in the body of the disbeliever and refuse to get out of it. The angels will keep beating the disbeliever until his soul exits from his body,  أَخْرِجُواْ أَنفُسَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ عَذَابَ الْهُونِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ غَيْرَ الْحَقِّ  ((Saying): \"Deliver your souls! This day you shall be recompensed with the torment of degradation because of what you used to say about Allah other than the truth.\") This Ayah means, today, you will be utterly humiliated because you used to invent lies against Allah and arrogantly refused to follow His Ayat and obey His Mesengers. There are many Hadiths, of Mutawatir grade, that explain what occurs when the believers and disbelievers die, and we will mention these Hadiths when explaining Allah's statement,  يُثَبِّتُ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِالْقَوْلِ الثَّابِتِ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ  (Allah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world, and in the Hereafter.) 14:27 Allah said next,  وَلَقَدْ جِئْتُمُونَا فُرَادَى كَمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ  (And truly you have come unto Us alone as We created you the first time.) 6:94, and this statement will be said on the Day of Return. In another Ayah, Allah said,  وَعُرِضُواْ عَلَى رَبِّكَ صَفَا لَّقَدْ جِئْتُمُونَا كَمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ  (And they will be set before your Lord in rows, (and Allah will say): \"Now indeed, you have come to Us as We created you the first time.') 18:48, meaning, just as We started your creation, We brought you back, although you used to deny Resurrection and reject its possibility. Therefore, this is the Day of Resurrection! Allah said,  وَتَرَكْتُمْ مَّا خَوَّلْنَـكُمْ وَرَاءَ ظُهُورِكُمْ  (You have left behind you all that which We had bestowed on you.) 6:94, The wealth and the money that you collected in the life of the world, you left all this behind you. It is recorded in the Sahih that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,  «يَقُولُ ابْنُ آدَمَ مَالِي مَالِي وَهَلْ لَكَ مِنْ مَالِكَ إِلَّا مَا أَكَلْتَ فَأَفْنَيْتَ، أَوْ لَبِسْتَ فَأَبْلَيْتَ، أَوْ تَصَدَّقْتَ فَأَمْضَيْتَ، وَمَا سِوَى ذَلِكَ فَذَاهِبٌ وَتَارِكُهُ لِلنَّاس»  (The Son of Adam says, `My money, my money!' But, what part of your money do you have, other than what you eat of it and is thus spent, what you wear and tear and what you gave in chairty and thus remains (in the record of good deeds) Other than that, you will depart and leave it to the people.) Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, the Son of Adam will be brought, as if he were a golden chariot and Allah, the Most Honored, will ask, `Where is what you collected' He will reply, `O Lord! I collected it and left it as intact as ever.' Allah will say to him, `O Son of Adam! Where is what you sent forth for yourself (of righteous, good deeds),' and he will realize that he did not send forth anything for himself.\" Al-Hasan then recited the Ayah,  وَلَقَدْ جِئْتُمُونَا فُرَادَى كَمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَتَرَكْتُمْ مَّا خَوَّلْنَـكُمْ وَرَاءَ ظُهُورِكُمْ  (And truly you have come unto Us alone as We created you the first time. You have left behind you all that which We had bestowed on you.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this statement. Allah said;  وَمَا نَرَى مَعَكُمْ شُفَعَآءَكُمُ الَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ أَنَّهُمْ فِيكُمْ شُرَكَآءُ  (We see not with you your intercessors whom you claimed to be your partners.) This chastises and criticizes the disbelievers for the rivals, idols and images that they worshipped in this life, thinking they will avail them in this life and upon Resurrection, if there is Resurrection, as they thought. On the Day of Resurrection, all relationships will be cut off, misguidance will be exposed, and those whom they used to call upon as gods will disappear from them. Allah will then call them, while the rest of creation is listening,  أَيْنَ شُرَكَآئِىَ الَّذِينَ كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ  (Where are My (so-called) partners whom you used to assert) 28:62 And,  وَقِيلَ لَهُمْ أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْبُدُونَ - مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ هَلْ يَنصُرُونَكُمْ أَوْ يَنتَصِرُونَ  (And it will be said to them: \"Where are those that you used to worship. Instead of Allah Can they help you or help themselves\") 26:92-93 Allah said here,  وَمَا نَرَى مَعَكُمْ شُفَعَآءَكُمُ الَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ أَنَّهُمْ فِيكُمْ شُرَكَآءُ  (We see not with you your intercessors whom you claimed were partners.) meaning partners in worship. That is, partners in a share of your worship.  لَقَد تَّقَطَّعَ بَيْنَكُمْ  (Now you and they have been cut off) or, the Ayah is recited with the meaning: all connections, means, and ties between you and them have been severed.  وَضَلَّ عَنكُم  (and vanished from you) you have lost,  مَّا كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ  (all that you used to claim) of hope in the benefit of the idols and rivals (you worshipped with Allah). Allah said in other Ayat,  إِذْ تَبَرَّأَ الَّذِينَ اتُّبِعُواْ مِنَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُواْ وَرَأَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ الاٌّسْبَابُ - وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُواْ لَوْ أَنَّ لَنَا كَرَّةً فَنَتَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُمْ كَمَا تَبَرَّءُواْ مِنَّا كَذَلِكَ يُرِيهِمُ اللَّهُ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ حَسَرَتٍ عَلَيْهِمْ وَمَا هُم بِخَـرِجِينَ مِنَ النَّارِ  (When those who were followed, declare themselves innocent of those who followed (them), and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them. And those who followed will say: \"If only we had one more chance to return, we would disown them as they have disowned us.\" Thus Allah will show them their deeds as regret for them. And they will never get out of the Fire.) 2:166-167, and  فَإِذَا نُفِخَ فِى الصُّورِ فَلاَ أَنسَـبَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ  (Then, when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another.) 23:101, and  إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ  (You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah, and the love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) 29:25, and  وَقِيلَ ادْعُواْ شُرَكَآءَكُمْ فَدَعَوْهُمْ فَلَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَهُمْ  (And it will be said (to them): \"Call upon your partners\", and they will call upon them, but they will give no answer to them.) 28:64, and  وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعاً ثُمَّ نَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ  (And the Day whereon We shall gather them all together, then We shall say to those who committed Shirk...) 10:28 until,  وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ  (And their invented false deities will vanish from them.) 10:30 "
