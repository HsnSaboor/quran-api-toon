tafsir[11]{c,v,t}:
  12,53,"<h2>The King investigates what happened between the Wife of the `Aziz, the Women in the City, and Yusuf</h2> Allah narrates to us that when the king was conveyed the interpretation of his dream, he liked Yusuf's interpretation and felt sure that it was true. He realized the virtue of Prophet Yusuf, recognized his knowledge in the interpretation of dreams and valued his good conduct with his subjects in his country. The king said,  ائْتُونِى بِهِ  (Bring him to me.) `Release him from prison and bring him to me.' When the king's emissary came to Yusuf and conveyed the news of his imminent release, Yusuf refused to leave the prison until the king and his subjects declare his innocence and the integrity of his honor, denouncing the false accusation that the wife of the `Aziz made against him. He wanted them to know that sending him to prison was an act of injustice and aggression, not that he committed an offense that warranted it. He said,  ارْجِعْ إِلَى رَبِّكَ  (Return to your lord (i.e. king...) The Sunnah of our Prophet praised Prophet Yusuf and asserted his virtues, honor, elevated rank and patience, may Allah's peace and blessings be on him. The Musnad and the Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,  «نَحْنُ أَحَقُّ بِالشَّكِّ مِنْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِذْ قَال»  (We are more liable to be in doubt than Ibrahim when he said,)  رَبِّ أَرِنِى كَيْفَ تُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى  (My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead. ..)  «وَيَرْحَمُ اللهُ لُوطًا لَقَدْ كَانَ يَأْوِي إِلَى رُكْنٍ شَدِيدٍ، وَلَوْ لَبِثْتُ فِي السِّجْنِ مَا لَبِثَ يُوسُفُ لَأَجَبْتُ الدَّاعِي»  (And may Allah send His mercy on Lut! He wished to have powerful support! If I were to stay in prison for such a long time as Yusuf did, I would have accepted the offer.) In another narration collected by Ahmad from Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said about Yusuf's statement,  فَاسْأَلْهُ مَا بَالُ النِّسْوَةِ الَّـتِى قَطَّعْنَ أَيْدِيَهُنَّ إِنَّ رَبِّى بِكَيْدِهِنَّ عَلِيمٌ  (\"...and ask him, `What happened to the women who cut their hands Surely, my Lord (Allah) is Well-Aware of their plot.\"')  «لَوْ كُنْتُ أَنَا، لَأَسْرَعْتُ الْإِجَابَةَ وَمَا ابْتَغَيْتُ الْعُذْر»  (If it was me, I would have accepted the offer rather than await my exoneration first.) Allah said (that the king asked),  قَالَ مَا خَطْبُكُنَّ إِذْ رَاوَدتُنَّ يُوسُفَ عَن نَّفْسِهِ  (He said, \"What was your affair when you did seek to seduce Yusuf\") The king gathered those women who cut their hands, while being hosted at the house of the wife of the `Aziz. He asked them all, even though he was directing his speech at the wife of his minister, the `Aziz in particular. He asked the women who cut their hands,  مَا خَطْبُكُنَّ  (What was your affair...), what was your story with regards to,  إِذْ رَاوَدتُنَّ يُوسُفَ عَن نَّفْسِهِ  (when you did seek to seduce Yusuf) on the day of the banquet  قُلْنَ حَاشَ للَّهِ مَا عَلِمْنَا عَلَيْهِ مِن سُوءٍ  (The women said: \"Allah forbid! No evil know we against him!\") The women answered the king, `Allah forbid that Yusuf be guilty of this, for by Allah, we never knew him to do evil.' This is when,  قَالَتِ امْرَأَتُ الْعَزِيزِ الَنَ حَصْحَصَ الْحَقُّ  (The wife of the `Aziz said: \"Now the truth has Hashasa...\") or the truth is manifest to all, according to Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others. Hashasa also means, `became clear and plain',  أَنَاْ رَوَدْتُّهُ عَن نَّفْسِهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَمِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ  (it was I who sought to seduce him, and he is surely of the truthful.) when he said,  هِىَ رَاوَدَتْنِى عَن نَّفْسِى  (It was she that sought to seduce me.)  ذَلِكَ لِيَعْلَمَ أَنِّى لَمْ أَخُنْهُ بِالْغَيْبِ  (in order that he may know that I betrayed him not in (his) absence. ) She said, `I admit this against myself so that my husband knows that I did not betray him in his absence and that adultery did not occur. I tried to seduce this young man and he refused, and I am admitting this so that he knows I am innocent,'  وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِى كَيْدَ الْخَـئِنِينَوَمَآ أُبَرِّىءُ نَفْسِى  (And, verily, Allah guides not the plot of the betrayers. And I free not myself (from the blame).) She said, `I do not exonerate myself from blame, because the soul wishes and lusts, and this is what made me seduce him,' for,  النَّفْسَ لأَمَّارَةٌ بِالسُّوءِ إِلاَّ مَا رَحِمَ رَبِّى  (Verily, the (human) self is inclined to evil, except when my Lord bestows His mercy (upon whom He wills).) whom Allah the Exalted wills to grant them immunity,  إِنَّ رَبِّى غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ  (Verily, my Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This is the most viable and suitable understanding for the continuity of the story and the meanings of Arabic speech. Al-Mawardi mentioned this in his Tafsir, in support of it, it was also preferred by Imam Abu Al-`Abbas Ibn Taymiyyah who wrote about it in detail in a separate work. It was said Yusuf peace be upon him is the one who said,  ذَلِكَ لِيَعْلَمَ أَنِّى لَمْ أَخُنْهُ  (in order that he (the `Aziz) may know that I betrayed him not) with his wife,  بِالْغَيْبِ  (in (his) absence).) until the end of Ayah (53) He said, `I sent back the emissary, so that the king would investigate my innocence and the `Aziz be certain that,  أَنِّى لَمْ أَخُنْهُ  (I betrayed him not), with his wife,  بِالْغَيْبِ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِى كَيْدَ الْخَـئِنِينَ  (in (his) absence. And, verily, Allah guides not the plot of the betrayers.)' This is the only explanation presented by Ibn Jarir At-Tabari and Ibn Abi Hatim, but the first view is stronger and more obvious because it is a continuation of what the wife of the `Aziz said in the presence of the king. Yusuf was not present at all during this time, for he was released later on and brought to the king by his order. "

  12,55,"<h2>Yusuf's Rank with the King of Egypt</h2> Allah states that when he became aware of Yusuf's innocence and his innocense of what he was accused of, the king said,  ﴾ائْتُونِى بِهِ أَسْتَخْلِصْهُ لِنَفْسِى﴿ (Bring him to me that I may attach him to my person.), `that I may make him among my close aids and associates,'  ﴾فَلَمَّا كَلَّمَهُ﴿ (Then, when he spoke to him), when the king spoke to Yusuf and further recognized his virtues, great ability, brilliance, good conduct and perfect mannerism, he said to him,  ﴾إِنَّكَ الْيَوْمَ لَدَيْنَا مِكِينٌ أَمِينٌ﴿ (Verily, this day, you are with us high in rank and fully trusted.) The king said to Yusuf, `You have assumed an exalted status with us and are indeed fully trusted.' Yusuf, peace be upon him said,  ﴾اجْعَلْنِى عَلَى خَزَآئِنِ الاٌّرْضِ إِنِّى حَفِيظٌ عَلِيمٌ﴿ (Set me over the storehouses of the land; I will indeed guard them with full knowledge.) Yusuf praised himself, for this is allowed when one's abilities are unknown and there is a need to do so. He said that he is,  ﴾حَفِيظٌ﴿ (Hafiz), an honest guard,  ﴾عَلِيمٌ﴿ (`Alim), having knowledge and wisdom about the job he is to be entrusted with. Prophet Yusuf asked the king to appoint him as minister of finance for the land, responsible for the harvest storehouses, in which they would collect produce for the years of drought which he told them will come. He wanted to be the guard, so that he could dispense the harvest in the wisest, best and most beneficial way. The king accepted Yusuf's offer, for he was eager to draw Yusuf close to him and to honor him. So Allah said,  "

  12,57,"<h2>Yusuf's Reign in Egypt</h2> Allah said next,  ﴾وَكَذلِكَ مَكَّنَّا لِيُوسُفَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ﴿ (Thus did We give full authority to Yusuf in the land), in Egypt,  ﴾يَتَبَوَّأُ مِنْهَا حَيْثُ يَشَآءُ﴿ (to take possession therein, when or where he likes.) As-Suddi and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that this part of the Ayah means, \"To do whatever he wants therein.\" Ibn Jarir at Tabari said that it means, \"He used to move about freely in the land after being imprisoned, suffering from hardship and the disgrace of slavery.\" Allah said next,  ﴾نُصِيبُ بِرَحْمَتِنَا مَن نَّشَآءُ وَلاَ نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ﴿ (We bestow of Our mercy on whom We will, and We make not to be lost the reward of the good doers.) Allah says here, We did not let the patience of Yusuf, from the harm his brothers exerted on him and being imprisoned because of the wife of the `Aziz, to be lost. Instead, Allah the Exalted and Most Honored rewarded him with His aid and victory,  ﴾وَكَذَلِكَ مَكَّنَّا لِيُوسُفَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَتَبَوَّأُ مِنْهَا حَيْثُ يَشَآءُ نُصِيبُ بِرَحْمَتِنَا مَن نَّشَآءُ وَلاَ نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ - وَلاّجْرُ الاٌّخِرَةِ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَكَانُواْ يَتَّقُونَ ﴿ (And We make not to be lost the reward of the good doers. And verily, the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believed and had Taqwa.) Allah states that what He has prepared for His Prophet Yusuf, peace be upon him, in the Hereafter is much greater, subs- tantial and honored than the authority He gave him in this life. Allah said about His Prophet Sulayman (Solomon), peace be upon him,  ﴾هَـذَا عَطَآؤُنَا فَامْنُنْ أَوْ أَمْسِكْ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ - وَإِنَّ لَهُ عِندَنَا لَزُلْفَى وَحُسْنَ مَـَابٍ ﴿ (\"This is Our gift, so spend or withhold, no account will be asked of you.\" And verily, for him is a near access to Us, and a good (final) return (Paradise).) 38:39-40 Yusuf, peace be upon him, was appointed minister of finance by Ar-Rayyan bin Al-Walid, king of Egypt at the time, instead of the `Aziz who bought him and the husband of she who tried to seduce him. The king of Egypt embraced Islam at the hands of Yusuf, peace be upon him, according to Mujahid.  "

  12,62,"<h2>Yusuf's Brothers travel to Egypt</h2> As-Suddi, Muhammad bin Ishaq and several others said that the reason why Yusuf's brothers went to Egypt, is that after Yusuf became minister of Egypt and the seven years of abundance passed, then came the seven years of drought that struck all areas of Egypt. The drought also reached the area of Kana`an (Canaan), where Prophet Ya`qub, peace be upon him, and his children resided. Prophet Yusuf efficiently guarded the people's harvest and collected it, and what he collected became a great fortune for the people. This also permitted Yusuf to give gifts to the people who sought his aid from various areas who came to buy food and provisions for their families. Yusuf would not give a family man more than whatever a camel could carry, as annual provisions for them. Yusuf himself did not fill his stomach from this food, nor did the king and his aids eat except one meal a day. By doing so, the people could sustain themselves with what they had for the remainder of the seven years. Indeed, Yusuf was a mercy from Allah sent to the people of Egypt. Yusuf's brothers were among those who came to Egypt to buy food supplies, by the order of their father. They knew that the `Aziz of Egypt was selling food to people who need it for a low price, so they took some merchandise from their land with them to exchange it for food. They were ten, because Ya`qub peace be upon him kept his son and Yusuf's brother Binyamin with him. Binyamin was the dearest of his sons to him after Yusuf. When Prophet Yusuf's brothers entered on him in his court and the center of his authority, he knew them the minute he saw them. However, they did not recognize him because they got rid of him when he was still young, and sold him to a caravan of travelers while unaware of their destination. They could not have imagined that Yusuf would end up being a minister, and this is why they did not recognize him, while he did recognize them. As-Suddi said that Yusuf started talking to his brothers and asked them, \"What brought you to my land\" They said, \"O, `Aziz, we came to buy provisions.\" He asked them, \"You might be spies.\" They said, \"Allah forbids.\" He asked them, \"Where are you from\" They said, \"From the area of Kana`an, and our father is Allah's Prophet Ya`qub.\" He asked them, \"Does he have other children besides you\" They said, \"Yes, we were twelve brothers. Our youngest died in the desert, and he used to be the dearest to his father. His full brother is alive and his father kept him, so that his closeness compensates him for losing our youngest brother who died.\" Yusuf ordered that his brothers be honored and allowed to remain,  ﴾وَلَمَّا جَهَّزَهُم بِجَهَازِهِمْ﴿ (And when he furnished them with their provisions,) according to their needs and gave them what they wanted to buy, he said to them, \"Bring me your brother from your father's side whom you mentioned, so that I know that you have told me the truth.\" He continued,  ﴾أَلاَ تَرَوْنَ أَنِّى أُوفِى الْكَيْلَ وَأَنَاْ خَيْرُ الْمُنْزِلِينَ﴿ (See you not that I give full measure, and that I am the best of the hosts) encouraging them to return to him. He then threatened them,  ﴾فَإِن لَّمْ تَأْتُونِى بِهِ فَلاَ كَيْلَ لَكُمْ عِندِى﴿ (But if you bring him not to me, there shall be no measure (of corn) for you with me. ) He threatened them that if the next time they come without Binyamin with them, they will not be allowed to buy the food that they need,  ﴾فَإِن لَّمْ تَأْتُونِى بِهِ فَلاَ كَيْلَ لَكُمْ عِندِى وَلاَ تَقْرَبُونِ - قَالُواْ سَنُرَوِدُ عَنْهُ أَبَاهُ وَإِنَّا لَفَـعِلُونَ ﴿ (\"...nor shall you come near me.\" They said: \"We shall try to get permission (for him) from his father, and verily, we shall do it.\") They said, `We will try our best to bring him with us, so that we spare no effort to prove to you that we are truthful in what we told you about ourselves.' Allah said,  ﴾وَقَالَ لِفِتْيَانِهِ﴿ (And Yusuf told his servants), or his slaves,  ﴾اجْعَلُواْ بِضَـعَتَهُمْ﴿ (to put their money), or the merchandise they brought with them to exchange for food,  ﴾فِى رِحَالِهِمْ﴿ (into their bags,), while they were unaware,  ﴾لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ﴿ (in order that they might come again.) It was said that Yusuf did this because he feared that his brothers might not have any more merchandise they could bring with them to exchange for food.  "
