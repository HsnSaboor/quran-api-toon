  72,17,"<h2>The Jinns testify that among Them there are Believers, Disbelievers, Misguided and Guided</h2> Allah says that the Jinns said about themselves, ﴾وَأَنَّا مِنَّا الصَّـلِحُونَ وَمِنَّا دُونَ ذَلِكَ﴿ (There are among us some that are righteous, and some the contrary;) meaning, other than that. ﴾كُنَّا طَرَآئِقَ قِدَداً﴿ (We are groups having different ways.) meaning, on numerous differing paths and having different thoughts and opinions. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others have said, ﴾كُنَّا طَرَآئِقَ قِدَداً﴿ (We are groups having different ways.) \"This means among us are believers and among us are disbelievers.\" Ahmad bin Sulayman An-Najjad reported in his (book of) Amali that he heard Al-A`mash saying, \"A Jinn came to us, so I said to him, `What is the most beloved food to your kind' He replied, `Rice.' So we brought them some rice and I saw the morsels being lifted but I did not see a hand lifting it. So I asked him, `Do you have these desires (religious innovations) among your kind as we have among ours' He replied, `Yes.' Then I said, `Who are the Rafidah among you' He said, `They are the worst of us.\"' I presented this chain of narration to our Shaykh, Al-Hafiz Abi Al-Hajjaj Al-Mizzi and he said its chain is authentic to Al-A`mash. <h2>The Jinns confess to Allah's Perfect Power</h2> Concerning Allah's statement, ﴾وَأَنَّا ظَنَنَّآ أَن لَّن نُّعْجِزَ اللَّهَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلَن نُّعْجِزَهُ هَرَباً ﴿ (And we think that we cannot escape Allah in the earth, nor can we escape Him by flight.) meaning, `we know that the power of Allah is decisive over us and that we cannot escape Him in the earth. Even if we try to flee, we know that He has complete control over us and that none of us can escape Him.' ﴾وَأَنَّا لَمَّا سَمِعْنَا الْهُدَى ءَامَنَّا بِهِ﴿ (And indeed when we heard the Guidance, we believed therein,) They were proud of this, and it is something for them to be proud of, as well as a great honor for them and a good characteristic. Concerning their statement, ﴾فَمَن يُؤْمِن بِرَبِّهِ فَلاَ يَخَافُ بَخْساً وَلاَ رَهَقاً﴿ (and whosoever believes in his Lord shall have no fear, either of a decrease in the reward of his good deeds or an increase in the punishment for his sins.) Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and others said, \"This means, he should not fear that the reward for his good deeds will be decreased or that he will be burdened with anything other than his sins.\" This is as Allah says, ﴾فَلاَ يَخَافُ ظُلْماً وَلاَ هَضْماً﴿ (Then he will have no fear of injustice, nor of any curtailment.) (20:112) ﴾وَأَنَّا مِنَّا الْمُسْلِمُونَ وَمِنَّا الْقَـسِطُونَ﴿ (And of us some are Muslims, and of us some are Al-Qasitun.) meaning, `among us there is the Muslim and the Qasit.' The Qasit is he who behaves unjustly with the truth and deviates from it. This is the opposite of the Muqsit, the one who is just. ﴾فَمَنْ أَسْلَمَ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ تَحَرَّوْاْ رَشَداً﴿ (And whosoever has embraced Islam, then such have sought the right path.) meaning, they sought salvation for themselves. ﴾وَأَمَّا الْقَـسِطُونَ فَكَانُواْ لِجَهَنَّمَ حَطَباً ﴿ (And as for the Qasitun, they shall be firewood for Hell.) meaning, fuel, for they will be used to kindle it (the Fire). Concerning Allah's statement, ﴾وَأَلَّوِ اسْتَقَـمُواْ عَلَى الطَّرِيقَةِ لاّسْقَيْنَـهُم مَّآءً غَدَقاً لِنَفْتِنَهُمْ فِيهِ﴿ (If they had believed in Allah, and went on the way, We would surely have bestowed on them water in abundance. That We might try them thereby.) The commentators have differed over the explanation of this. There are two views concerning it. The First View That if the deviant ones would stand firmly upon the path of Islam, being just upon it and remaining upon it, ﴾لاّسْقَيْنَـهُم مَّآءً غَدَقاً﴿ (We would surely have bestowed on them water in abundance.) meaning, a lot. The intent behind this is to say that they would be given an abundance of sustenance. With this, the meaning of Allah's statement, ﴾لِنَفْتِنَهُمْ فِيهِ﴿ (That We might try them thereby.) is that, `We will test them.' As Malik reported from Zayd bin Aslam, he said, \"That We might try them - means, so that We may test them to see who will remain upon the guidance from those who will turn back to sin.\" <h2>Mentioning Those Who held this View</h2> Al-`Awfi reported similar to this from Ibn `Abbas, and likewise said Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, `Ata, As-Suddi, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak. Muqatil said, \"This Ayah was revealed about the disbelievers of the Quraysh when they were deprived of rain for seven years.\" The Second View ﴾وَأَلَّوِ اسْتَقَـمُواْ عَلَى الطَّرِيقَةِ﴿ (If they had believed in Allah, and went on the way,) meaning, of misguidance. ﴾لاّسْقَيْنَـهُم مَّآءً غَدَقاً﴿ (We would surely have bestowed on them water in abundance.) meaning, `then We would have increased their sustenance to allow a gradual respite.' As Allah says, ﴾فَلَمَّا نَسُواْ مَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ حَتَّى إِذَا فَرِحُواْ بِمَآ أُوتُواْ أَخَذْنَـهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ مُّبْلِسُونَ ﴿ (So, when they forgot that with which they had been reminded, We opened for them the gates of everything, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them, and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows. ) (6:44) Allah also says, ﴾أَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّمَا نُمِدُّهُمْ بِهِ مِن مَّالٍ وَبَنِينَ - نُسَارِعُ لَهُمْ فِى الْخَيْرَتِ بَل لاَّ يَشْعُرُونَ ﴿ (Do they think that in wealth and children with which We expand them. We hasten unto them with good things. Nay, but they percieve not.) (23:55,56) This is the view of Abu Mijlaz and it agrees with the opinion of Ibn Humayd. For verily, he (Ibn Humayd) said concerning Allah's statement, ﴾وَأَلَّوِ اسْتَقَـمُواْ عَلَى الطَّرِيقَةِ﴿ (If they had believed in Allah, and went on the way,) \"This means the path of misguidance.\" Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim both recorded this. Al-Baghawi also mentioned it from Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Zayd bin Aslam, Al-Kalbi and Ibn Kaysan. It seems that he (Al-Baghawi) took this position. And it is supported by Allah's saying, \"That We might try them thereby.\" Concerning Allah's statement, ﴾وَمَن يُعْرِضْ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِّهِ يَسْلُكْهُ عَذَاباً صَعَداً﴿ (And whosoever turns away from the Reminder of his Lord, He will cause him to enter in a Sa`ad torment.) meaning, a harsh, severe, agonizing and painful punishment. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd, all said, ﴾عَذَاباً صَعَداً﴿ (in a Sa`ad torment.) \"This means harsh having no relaxation in it.\" It has also been reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"It is a mountain in Hell.\" It has been related from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said, \"It is a well in Hell.\" "

  72,24,"<h2>The Command to worship Allah Alone and shun Shirk</h2> Allah commands His servants to single Him out alone for worship and that none should be supplicated to along with Him, nor should any partners be associated with Him. As Qatadah said concerning Allah's statement,  وَأَنَّ الْمَسَـجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلاَ تَدْعُواْ مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَداً  (And the Masjids are for Allah, so invoke not anyone along with Allah.) \"Whenever the Jews and Christians used to enter their churches and synagogues, they would associate partners with Allah. Thus, Allah commanded His Prophet to tell them that they should single Him out alone for worship.\" Ibn Jarir recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said concerning this verse,  وَأَنَّ الْمَسَـجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلاَ تَدْعُواْ مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَداً  (And the Masjids are for Allah, so invoke not anyone along with Allah.) \"The Jinns said to the Prophet of Allah , `How can we come to the Masjid while we are distant - meaning very far away - from you And how can we be present for the prayer while we are far away from you' So Allah revealed this Ayah,  وَأَنَّ الْمَسَـجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلاَ تَدْعُواْ مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَداً  (And the Masjids are for Allah, so invoke not anyone along with Allah.)\" The Jinns crowding together to hear the Qur'an Allah said,  وَأَنَّهُ لَّمَا قَامَ عَبْدُ اللَّهِ يَدْعُوهُ كَادُواْ يَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِ لِبَداً  (And when the servant of Allah stood up invoking Him in prayer they just made round him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other.) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"When they heard the Prophet reciting the Qur'an they almost mounted on top of him due to their zeal. When they heard him reciting the Qur'an they drew very near to him. He was unaware of them until the messenger (i.e., Jibril) came to him and made him recite,  قُلْ أُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ أَنَّهُ اسْتَمَعَ نَفَرٌ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ  (Say: \"It has been revealed to me that a group of Jinn listened.\") (72:1) They were listening to the Qur'an.\" This is one opinion and it has been reported from Az-Zubayr bin Al-`Awwam. Ibn Jarir recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"The Jinns said to their people,  لَّمَا قَامَ عَبْدُ اللَّهِ يَدْعُوهُ كَادُواْ يَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِ لِبَداً  (when the servant of Allah stood up invoking Him in prayer they just made round him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other.) )\" This is the second view and it has also been reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr. Al-Hasan said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood up and said none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and he called the people to their Lord, the Arabs almost crowded over him together (against him).\" Qatadah said concerning Allah's statement,  وَأَنَّهُ لَّمَا قَامَ عَبْدُ اللَّهِ يَدْعُوهُ كَادُواْ يَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِ لِبَداً  (when the servant of Allah stood up invoking Him in prayer they just made round him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other.) \"Humans and Jinns both crowded together over this matter in order to extinguish it. However, Allah insisted upon helping it, supporting it and making it victorious over those who opposed it.\" This is the third view and it has also been reported from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ibn Zayd. It was also the view preferred by Ibn Jarir. This view seems to be the most apparent meaning of the Ayah due to Allah's statement which follows it,  قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَدْعُو رَبِّى وَلاَ أُشْرِكُ بِهِ أَحَداً  (Say: \"I invoke only my Lord, and I associate none as partners along with Him.\") meaning, when they harmed him, opposed him, denied him and stood against him in order to thwart the truth he came with, and to unite against him, the Messenger ﷺ said to them  إِنَّمَآ أَدْعُو رَبِّى  (I invoke only my Lord,) meaning, `I only worship my Lord alone, and He has no partners. I seek His help and I put my trust in Him.'  وَلاَ أُشْرِكُ بِهِ أَحَداً  (and I associate none as partners along with Him.) <h2>The Messenger ﷺ does not have Power to harm or give Guidance</h2> Concerning Allah's statement,  قُلْ إِنِّى لاَ أَمْلِكُ لَكُمْ ضَرّاً وَلاَ رَشَداً  (Say: \"It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the right path.\") meaning, `say: I am only a man like you all and I have received revelation. I am only a servant among the servants of Allah. I have no control over the affairs of your guidance or your misguidance. Rather all of these things are referred to Allah.' Then he (the Prophet) says about himself that no one can save him from Allah either. This means, `if I disobey Allah, then no one would be able to rescue me from His punishment.'  وَلَنْ أَجِدَ مِن دُونِهِ مُلْتَحَداً  (and nor can I find refuge except in Him.) Mujahid, Qatadah and As-Suddi all said, \"No place to escape to.\" <h2>It is only obligatory upon the Messenger ﷺ to convey the Message</h2> Concerning Allah's statement,  إِلاَّ بَلاَغاً مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِسَـلَـتِهِ  ((Mine is) but conveyance from Allah and His Messages,) This is an exception related to the previous statement,  لَن يُجِيرَنِى مِنَ اللَّهِ أَحَدٌ  (None can protect me from Allah's punishment,) meaning, `nothing can save me from Him and rescue me except my conveyance of the Message that He has obligated me to carry out.' This is as Allah says,  يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلْ فَمَا بَلَّغْتَ رِسَالَتَهُ وَاللَّهُ يَعْصِمُكَ مِنَ النَّاسِ  (O Messenger! Proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. Allah will protect you from mankind.) (5:67) Then Allah says,  وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَإِنَّ لَهُ نَارَ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً  (and whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, then verily, for him is the fire of Hell, he shall dwell therein forever.) meaning, `I will convey unto you all the Messages of Allah, so whoever disobeys after that, then his reward will be the fire of Hell wherein he will abide forever.' This means, they will not be able to avoid it nor escape from it. Then Allah says,  حَتَّى إِذَا رَأَوْاْ مَا يُوعَدُونَ فَسَيَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ أَضْعَفُ نَاصِراً وَأَقَلُّ عَدَداً  (Till, when they see that which they are promised, then they will know who it is that is weaker concerning helpers and less important concerning numbers.) meaning, until these idolators from the Jinns and humans see what has been promised to them on the Day of Judgement. Then on that day, they will know who's helpers are weaker and fewer in number -- them or the believers who worship Allah alone. This means that the idolators have no helper at all and they are fewer in number than the soldiers of Allah. "

  72,28,"<h2>The Messenger of Allah ﷺ does not know when the Hour will be</h2> Allah commands His Messenger to say to the people that he has no knowledge of when the Hour will be and he does not know whether its time is near or far.  قُلْ إِنْ أَدْرِى أَقَرِيبٌ مَّا تُوعَدُونَ أَمْ يَجْعَلُ لَهُ رَبِّى أَمَداً  (Say: \"I know not whether which you are promised is near or whether my Lord will appoint for it a distant term.\") meaning, a long period of time. In this noble Ayah is an evidence that the Hadith that many of the ignorant people often circulate, which says that the Prophet will not remain under the earth more than one thousand years (i.e., the Hour will be before that period) is a baseless lie. We have not seen it in any of the Books (of Hadith). Verily, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked about the time of the Hour and he would not respond. When Jibril appeared to him in the form of a bedouin Arab, one of the questions he asked the Prophet was, \"O Muhammad! Tell me about the Hour\" So the Prophet replied,  «مَا الْمَسْؤُولُ عَنْهَا بِأَعْلَمَ مِنَ السَّائِل»  (The one questioned about it knows no more than the questioner.) On another occasion when a bedouin Arab called out to the Prophet in a loud voice saying, \"O Muhammad! When will be the Hour\" The Prophet said,  «وَيْحَكَ إِنَّهَا كَائِنَةٌ، فَمَا أَعْدَدْتَ لَهَا؟»  (Woe unto you. Verily, it will occur so what have you prepared for it) The man replied, \"I have not prepared much for it of prayers and fasting, but I love Allah and His Messenger.\" The Prophet then replied,  «فَأَنْتَ مَعَ مَنْ أَحْبَبْت»  (Then you will be with whomever you love.) Anas said, \"The Muslims were not happier with anything like they were upon (hearing) this Hadith.\" Concerning Allah's statement,  عَـلِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلاَ يُظْهِرُ عَلَى غَيْبِهِ أَحَداً إِلاَّ مَنِ ارْتَضَى مِن رَّسُولٍ  (The All-Knower of the Unseen, and He reveals to none His Unseen. Except to a Messenger) This is similar to Allah's statement,  وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلاَّ بِمَا شَآءَ  (And they will never compass any thing of His knowledge except that which He wills.) (2:255) Similarly, Allah says here that He knows the unseen and the seen and that no one of His creation can attain any of His knowledge except that which Allah allows him to have. Thus, Allah says,  عَـلِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلاَ يُظْهِرُ عَلَى غَيْبِهِ أَحَداً إِلاَّ مَنِ ارْتَضَى مِن رَّسُولٍ  (The All-Knower of the Unseen, and He reveals to none His Unseen. Except to a Messenger whom He has chosen,) This includes the angelic Messenger and the human Messenger. Then Allah says,  فَإِنَّهُ يَسْلُكُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ رَصَداً  (and then He makes a band of watching guards to march before him and behind him.) meaning, He particularly gives him additional guardian angels who protect him by the command of Allah and they accompany him with that which is with him of Allah's revelation. Thus, Allah says,  لِّيَعْلَمَ أَن قَدْ أَبْلَغُواْ رِسَـلَـتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَأَحَاطَ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ وَأَحْصَى كُلَّ شَىْءٍ عَدَداً  (Till he knows that they have conveyed the Messages of their Lord. And He surrounds all that which is with them, and He keeps count of all things.) The pronoun `he' which is in His statement,  لِيَعْلَمَ  (Till he knows) refers to the Prophet . Ibn Jarir recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said concerning the Ayah,  عَـلِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلاَ يُظْهِرُ عَلَى غَيْبِهِ أَحَداً - إِلاَّ مَنِ ارْتَضَى مِن رَّسُولٍ فَإِنَّهُ يَسْلُكُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ رَصَداً  (The All-Knower of the Unseen, and He reveals to none His Unseen. Except to a Messenger whom He has chosen, and then He makes a band of watching guards to march before him and behind him.) \"These are four guardians among the angels along with Jibril,  لِيَعْلَمَ  (Till he knows) This means Muhammad ﷺ,  أَن قَدْ أَبْلَغُواْ رِسَـلَـتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَأَحَاطَ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ وَأَحْصَى كُلَّ شَىْءٍ عَدَداً  (that they have conveyed the Messages of their Lord. And He surrounds all that which is with them, and He keeps count of all things.)\" This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. It has also been reported by Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi and Yazid bin Abi Habib. `Abdur-Razzaq reported from Ma`mar, from Qatadah,  لِّيَعْلَمَ أَن قَدْ أَبْلَغُواْ رِسَـلَـتِ رَبِّهِمْ  (Till he knows that they have conveyed the Messages of their Lord.) \"So that the Prophet of Allah would know that the Messengers had conveyed their Messages from Allah and that the angels have protected them and defended them.\" This has also been reported by Sa`id bin Abi `Arubah from Qatadah, and Ibn Jarir preferred this interpretation. Al-Baghawi said, \"Ya`qub recited it as, (لِيُعْلَمَ) (in order to be known) this means, so that the people may know that the Messengers had conveyed the Message.\" It also could carry the meaning that the pronoun refers to Allah (i.e., So that He (Allah) may know). This opinion has been mentioned by Ibn Al-Jawzi in Zad Al-Masir. The meaning of this is that He protects His Messengers through His angels so that they will be able to convey His Messages. He protects what He reveals to them of revelation so that He will know that they have indeed conveyed the Messages of their Lord. This is like His statement,  وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الْقِبْلَةَ الَّتِى كُنتَ عَلَيْهَآ إِلاَّ لِنَعْلَمَ مَن يَتَّبِعُ الرَّسُولَ مِمَّن يَنقَلِبُ عَلَى عَقِبَيْهِ  (And We made the Qiblah which you used to face, only that We know who followed the Messenger from those who would turn on their heels.) (2:143) Allah also said,  وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ الْمُنَـفِقِينَ  (Verily, Allah knows those who believe, and that He knows the hypocrites.) (29:11) It should be added to these examples that from Allah's knowledge is that He knows all things before they occur, and this is something definite and certain. Therefore, He says after this,  وَأَحَاطَ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ وَأَحْصَى كُلَّ شَىْءٍ عَدَداً  (And He surrounds all that which is with them, and He keeps count of all things.) This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Jinn, and all praises and thanks are due to Allah. "
