  11,90,"﴾وَيقَوْمِ لاَ يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شِقَاقِى﴿ (And O my people! Let not my Shiqaq cause you) This means, \"Do not let your hatred and enmity of me cause you to persist in your corruption and disbelief. If you continue this way, you will suffer the same vengeance and torment that overcame Nuh's people, Hud's people, Salih's people and Lut's people.\" Qatadah said,  ﴾وَيقَوْمِ لاَ يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شِقَاقِى﴿ (And O my people! Let not my Shiqaq cause you) \"He is saying, `Do not be influenced by your differing with me.\"' As-Suddi said, \"This means your enmity of me should not lead you to continue in misguidance and disbelief, or else you will be afflicted by what afflicted them.\" Concerning His statement,  ﴾وَمَا قَوْمُ لُوطٍ مِّنكُم بِبَعِيدٍ﴿ (and the people of Lut are not far off from you!) It has been said that this refers to the period of time. Qatadah said, \"This means that they were only destroyed before you yesterday.\" It has also been said that it refers to place. Actually, the verse carries both meanings.  ﴾وَاسْتَغْفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمْ﴿ (And ask forgiveness of your Lord) from the previous sins.  ﴾ثُمَّ تُوبُواْ إِلَيْهِ﴿ (and turn unto Him in repentance.) In whatever evil actions you may encounter in the future. Concerning his statement,  ﴾إِنَّ رَبِّى رَحِيمٌ وَدُودٌ﴿ (Verily, my Lord is Most Merciful, Most Loving.) to those who repent.  "

  11,92,"<h2>The Response of Shu`ayb's People</h2> They said,  ﴾يشُعَيْبُ مَا نَفْقَهُ﴿ (O Shu`ayb! We do not understand) This means that we do not comprehend.  ﴾كَثِيراً﴿ (much) `most of what you say'. Ath-Thawri said, \"He (Shu`ayb) was called the orator of the Prophets.\" As-Suddi said,  ﴾وَإِنَّا لَنَرَاكَ فِينَا ضَعِيفًا﴿ (and we see you weak among us.) \"They meant, `You are only one person.\"' Abu Rawq said, \"They meant, `You are despised, because your tribe is not upon your religion.\"'  ﴾وَلَوْلاَ رَهْطُكَ لَرَجَمْنَـكَ﴿ (Were it not for your family, you would have been stoned,) This means, your people. Were it not for their powerful position over the people of Madyan, they would have stoned him to death. Some said that this means with rocks. It has also been said that this means that they would have cursed and insulted him verbally.  ﴾وَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْنَا بِعَزِيزٍ﴿ (and you are not powerful against us.) This means, \"You have no position of power over us.\" <h2>Shu`ayb's Refutation of His People</h2>﴾قَالَ يقَوْمِ أَرَهْطِى أَعَزُّ عَلَيْكُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ﴿ (He said: \"O my people! Is then my family of more weight with you than Allah\")( He says: You would leave me alone out of respect for my people but not out of respect for the greatness of the Lord, the Most Blessed and Exalted Does not your awe of Allah prevent you from harming His Prophet Indeed you have placed the fear of Allah,  ﴾وَرَآءَكُمْ ظِهْرِيّاً﴿ (behind your backs.) This means that you have thrown it behind you. You do not obey it, nor do you respect it.  ﴾إِنَّ رَبِّى بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطٌ﴿ (Verily, my Lord is surrounding all that you do.) This means that He knows all of your actions and He will reward you according to them.  "

  11,95,"<h2>Shu` ayb's threatening of His People When the Prophet of Allah,Shu` ayb, despaired of their response to him, he said, \"O mypeople</h2>﴾اعْمَلُواْ عَلَى مَكَانَتِكُمْ﴿ (Act according to your ability,) This means, \"Act according to your current ways.\" This is actually a severe threat.  ﴾إِنِّى عَـمِلٌ﴿ (I am acting.) according to my way.  ﴾سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ مَن يَأْتِيهِ عَذَابٌ يُخْزِيهِ وَمَنْ هُوَ كَاذِبٌ﴿ (You will come to know who it is on whom descends the torment that will cover him with ignominy, and who is a liar!) meaning, between me and you.  ﴾وَارْتَقِبُواْ﴿ (And watch you!) This means to wait.  ﴾إِنِّى مَعَكُمْ رَقِيبٌ﴿ (I too am watching with you.) Allah then says,  ﴾وَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا نَجَّيْنَا شُعَيْبًا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِّنَّا وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِى دِيَـرِهِمْ جَـثِمِينَ ﴿ (And when Our commandment came, We saved Shu`ayb and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us. And As-Sayhah (awful cry) seized the wrongdoers, and they lay (Jathimin) in their homes.) His saying Jathimin means extinct and lifeless without any movement. Here Allah mentions that a loud cry (Sayhah) came to them. In Surat Al-A`raf He says a severe quake (Rajfah) came to them. In Surat Ash-Shu`ara', He said it was a torment of a cloudy day. They were one nation upon which all of these punishments were gathered on the day of their destruction. In each context, Allah only mentioned that which was suitable. In Surat Al-A`raf when they said,  ﴾لَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ﴿ (We shall certainly drive you out, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you from our town.)7:88 In this verse it was suitable to mention a tremor, or quake (Rajfah). The earth in which they practiced their wrongdoing and they wanted to expel their Prophet from it, shook them. Here, due to their disrespectful manners in speaking to their Prophet, Allah mentioned the awful cry (Sayhah) which overcame them and killed them. In Surat Ash-Shu`ara' when they said,  ﴾فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ ﴿ (So cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!)26:187 Allah said in response,  ﴾فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ﴿ (So the torment of the day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.)26:189 This is from the intricate secrets and to Allah belongs all praise and much bounty forever. Concerning the statement,  ﴾كَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْاْ فِيهَآ﴿ (As if they had never lived there!) This means it was as if they had not lived in their homes before that.  ﴾أَلاَ بُعْدًا لِّمَدْيَنَ كَمَا بَعِدَتْ ثَمُودُ﴿ (So away with Madyan as just as Thamud went away!) They (Thamud) were their neighbors and they did not live far from the homes of the people of Madyan. They were similar in their disbelief and their highway robbery. They were also both Arabs.  "
