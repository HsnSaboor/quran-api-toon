  34,42,"<h2>The Angels will disown Their Worshippers on the Day of Resurrection</h2> Allah tells us that on the Day of Resurrection, He will rebuke the idolators before all of creation. He will ask the angels whom the idolators used to worship, claiming that their idols were in the form of these angels and that they could bring them nearer to Allah. He will ask the angels: ﴾أَهَـؤُلاَءِ إِيَّاكُمْ كَانُواْ يَعْبُدُونَ﴿ (Was it you that these people used to worship) meaning, `did you command them to worship you' Allah says in Surat Al-Furqan: ﴾أَءَنتُمْ أَضْلَلْتُمْ عِبَادِى هَـؤُلاَءِ أَمْ هُمْ ضَلُّوا السَّبِيلَ﴿ (Was it you who misled these My servants or did they (themselves) stray from the (right) path) (25:17). And He will say to `Isa, peace be upon him: ﴾أَءَنتَ قُلتَ لِلنَّاسِ اتَّخِذُونِى وَأُمِّىَ إِلَـهَيْنِ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ قَالَ سُبْحَـنَكَ مَا يَكُونُ لِى أَنْ أَقُولَ مَا لَيْسَ لِى بِحَقٍّ﴿ (Did you say unto men: \"Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah,' He will say: \"Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say).\") (5:116). Similarly, the angels will say: ﴾سُبْحَـنَكَ﴿ Glorified be You! meaning, exalted and sanctified be You above the notion that there could be any god besides You. ﴾أَنتَ وَلِيُّنَا مِن دُونِهِمْ﴿ You are our Protector instead of them. means, we are Your servants and we disown these people before You. ﴾بَلْ كَانُواْ يَعْبُدُونَ الْجِنَّ﴿ (Nay, but they used to worship the Jinn;) meaning, the Shayatin, because they are the ones who made idol worship attractive to them and who misguided them. ﴾أَكْـثَرُهُم بِهِم مُّؤْمِنُونَ﴿ most of them were believers in them. This is like the A0yah: ﴾إِن يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ إِلاَّ إِنَـثاً وَإِن يَدْعُونَ إِلاَّ شَيْطَـناً مَّرِيداً لَّعَنَهُ اللَّهُ﴿ (They invoke nothing but females besides Him, and they invoke nothing but Shaytan, a persistent rebel! Allah cursed him) (4:117-118). Allah says: ﴾فَالْيَوْمَ لاَ يَمْلِكُ بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ نَّفْعاً وَلاَ ضَرّاً﴿ (So Today, none of you can profit or harm one another.) means, `none of those idols and rivals whom you hoped would benefit you, will be of any avail to you, those whom you worshipped in the hope that they would help you at times of stress and calamity. Today they will have no power either to benefit you or to harm you.' ﴾وَنَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ﴿ And We shall say to those who did wrong: -- meaning the idolators -- ﴾ذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ النَّارِ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ﴿ (\"Taste the torment of the Fire which you used to deny.\") meaning, this will be said to them by way of rebuke.

  34,45,"<h2>The Saying of the Disbelievers about the Prophets, and its refutation</h2> Allah tells us that the disbeliever deserve to be severely punished by Him, because when His clear Verses were recited to them, and they heard them fresh from the lips of His Messenger , they said:  قَالُواْ مَا هَـذَا إِلاَّ رَجُلٌ يُرِيدُ أَن يَصُدَّكُمْ عَمَّا كَانَ يَعْبُدُ ءَابَآؤُكُمْ  (They say: \"This is naught but a man who wishes to hinder you from that which your fathers used to worship.\") meaning, that the religion of their fathers was the truth and that what the Messenger brought to them was false -- may the curse of Allah be upon them and their fathers!  وَقَالُواْ مَا هَـذَآ إِلاَّ إِفْكٌ مُّفْتَرًى  (And they say: \"This is nothing but an invented lie.\") referring to the Qur'an. l  وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ  (And those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them: \"This is nothing but evident magic!\") Allah says:  وَمَآ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ مِّنْ كُتُبٍ يَدْرُسُونَهَا وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ  (And We had not given them Scriptures that they could study, nor sent to them before you any warner) meaning, Allah did not reveal any Book to the Arabs before the Qur'an, and He did not send any Prophet to them before Muhammad ﷺ . They used to wish for that and say, `if only a warner comes to us or a Book is revealed to us, we would be more guided than others,' but when Allah blessed them with that, they disbelieved him and stubbornly rejected him. Then Allah says:  وَكَذَّبَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبلِهِمْ  (And those before them denied;) meaning, other nations.  وَمَا بَلَغُواْ مِعْشَارَ مَآ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ  (these have not received even a tenth of what We had granted to those (of old);) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Of the power of this world.\" This was also the view of Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This is like the Ayat:  وَلَقَدْ مَكَّنَـهُمْ فِيمَآ إِن مَّكَّنَّـكُمْ فِيهِ وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُمْ سَمْعاً وَأَبْصَـراً وَأَفْئِدَةً فَمَآ أَغْنَى عَنْهُمْ سَمْعُهُمْ وَلاَ أَبْصَـرُهُمْ وَلاَ أَفْئِدَتُهُمْ مِّن شَىْءٍ إِذْ كَانُواْ يَجْحَدُونَ بِـَايَـتِ اللَّهِ وَحَاقَ بِهم مَّا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ  (And indeed We had firmly established them with that wherewith We have not established you! And We had assigned them the hearing, seeing, and hearts; but their hearing, seeing, and their hearts availed them nothing since they used to deny the Ayat of Allah, and they were completely encircled by that which they used to mock at!) (46: 26)  أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً  (Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82). but that did not protect them from the punishment of Allah, and Allah destroyed them because they denied His Messengers. Allah says:  فَكَذَّبُواْ رُسُلِى فَكَيْفَ كَانَ نَكِيرِ  (yet they denied My Messengers. Then how (terrible) was My denial!) meaning, `how severe was My wrath and how great was My avenging of My Messengers.' "
  34,46,"<h2>Refutation of Their Accusation that the Prophet was Insane</h2> Allah says: `Say, O Muhammad, to these disbelievers who claim that you are crazy,' ﴾إِنَّمَآ أَعِظُكُمْ بِوَحِدَةٍ﴿ I exhort you to one (thing) only, meaning, I am only telling you to one thing, and that is: ﴾أَن تَقُومُواْ لِلَّهِ مَثْنَى وَفُرَادَى ثُمَّ تَتَفَكَّرُواْ مَا بِصَـحِبِكُمْ مِّن جِنَّةٍ﴿ that you stand up for Allah s sake in pairs and singly, and reflect, there is no madness in your companion. meaning, `stand sincerely before Allah, without being influenced by your own desires or tribal feelings, and ask one another, is Muhammad crazy Advise one another,' ﴾ثُمَّ تَتَفَكَّرُواْ﴿ and reflect means, let each person look within himself concerning the matter of Muhلammad , and ask other people about him if he is still confused, then let him think about the matter. Allah says: ﴾أَن تَقُومُواْ لِلَّهِ مَثْنَى وَفُرَادَى ثُمَّ تَتَفَكَّرُواْ مَا بِصَـحِبِكُمْ مِّن جِنَّةٍ﴿ (that you stand up for Allah's sake in pairs and singly, and reflect, there is no madness in your companion.) This meaning was stated by Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ka`b, As-Suddi, Qatadah and others. This is what is meant by the Ayah. ﴾إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ لَّكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيدٍ﴿ (He is only a warner to you in face of a severe torment.) Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on this Ayah: \"One day, the Prophet climbed up As-Safa' and shouted, ﴾«يَا صَبَاحَاه»﴿ (O people!) The Quraysh gathered around him, and said, `What is the matter with you' He said, ﴾«أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ الْعَدُوَّ يُصَبِّحُكُمْ أَوْ يُمَسِّيكُمْ أَمَا كُنْتُمْ تُصَدِّقُونِّي»﴿ (What do you think If I told you that the enemy were approaching and will reach us in the morning or in the evening, would you believe me) They said, `Of course.' He said: ﴾«فَإِنِّي نَذِيرٌ لَكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَيْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيد»﴿ (I am a warner to you in the face of a severe punishment.) Abu Lahab said, `May you perish! You have called us together only to tell us this' Then Allah revealed: ﴾تَبَّتْ يَدَآ أَبِى لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ ﴿ (Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab and perish he!) (111:1) We have already discussed this in our Tafsir of the Ayah: ﴾وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ ﴿ (And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214). "
