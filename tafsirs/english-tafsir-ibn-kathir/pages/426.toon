tafsir[8]{c,v,t}:
  33,55,"<h2>Relatives before Whom a Woman does not need to observe Hijab</h2> When Allah commands women to observe Hijab in front of men to whom they are not related, He explains who are the relatives before whom they do not need to observe Hijab. This is like the exceptions stated in Surat An-Nur, where Allah says: ﴾وَلاَ يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلاَّ لِبُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَآءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ أَبْنَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ أَبْنَآءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ إِخْوَانِهِنَّ أَوْ بَنِى إِخْوَانِهِنَّ أَوْ بَنِى أَخَوَتِهِنَّ أَوْ نِسَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَـنُهُنَّ أَوِ التَّـبِعِينَ غَيْرِ أُوْلِى الإِرْبَةِ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ أَوِ الطِّفْلِ الَّذِينَ لَمْ يَظْهَرُواْ عَلَى عَوْرَتِ النِّسَآءِ﴿ (And not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbands' fathers, or their sons, or their husbands' sons, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or their right hand possessions, or the Tabi`in among men who do not have desire, or small children who are not aware of the nakedness of women.) (24:31). The Ayah contains more detail than this, which we have already discussed in the Tafsir of the Ayah and do not need to repeat here. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ash-Sha`bi and `Ikrimah said concerning the Ayah, ﴾لاَّ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِنَّ فِى ءَابَآئِهِنَّ﴿ (It is no sin on them before their fathers...) I said, \"What about the paternal uncle and the maternal uncle -- why are they not mentioned\" He said: \"Because they may describe her to their sons, so it is disliked for a woman to remove her covering in front of her paternal uncle or maternal uncle.\" ﴾وَلاَ نِسَآئِهِنَّ﴿ (or their own women,) means that they do not have to observe Hijab in front of other believing women. ﴾وَلاَ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُنَّ﴿ (or their (female) slaves.) Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said: \"This means female slaves only.\" This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. ﴾وَاتَّقِينَ اللَّهَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ شَهِيداً﴿ (And (O ladies) have Taqwa of Allah. Verily, Allah is Ever All-Witness over everything.) means, and fear Him in private and in public, for He witnesses all things and nothing is hidden from Him, so think of the One Who is always watching. "
  33,56,"<h2>The Command to say Salah upon the Prophet</h2> Al-Bukhari said: \"Abu Al-`Aliyah said: \"Allah's Salah is His praising him before the angels, and the Salah of the angels is their supplication.\" Ibn `Abbas said: \"They send blessings.\" Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi said: \"This was narrated from Sufyan Ath-Thawri and other scholars, who said: `The Salah of the Lord is mercy, and the Salah of the angels is their seeking forgiveness. There are Mutawatir Hadiths narrated from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ commanding us to send blessings on him and how we should say Salah upon him. We will mention as many of them as we can, if Allah wills, and Allah is the One Whose help we seek. In his Tafsir of this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Ka`b bin `Ujrah said, \"It was said, `O Messenger of Allah, with regard to sending Salam upon you, we know about this, but how about Salah' He said:  «قُولُوا: اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ ، إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ، اللَّهُمَّ بَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ، إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيد»  (Say: \"O Allah, send Your Salah upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent Your Salah upon the family of Ibrahim, verily You are the Most Praiseworthy, Most Glorious. O Allah, send Your blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent Your blessings upon the family of Ibrahim, verily You are Most Praiseworthy, Most Glorious.\")\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Abi Layla said that Ka`b bin `Ujrah met him and said, \"Shall I not give you a gift The Messenger of Allah ﷺ came out to us and we said, `O Messenger of Allah! We know how to send Salam upon you, but how can we send Salah' He said:  «قُولُوا: اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ ، إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ، اللَّهُمَّ بَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ، إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيد»  (Say: \"O Allah, send Your Salah upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent Your Salah upon the family of Ibrahim, verily You are the Most Praiseworthy, Most Glorious. O Allah, send Your blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent Your blessings upon the family of Ibrahim, verily You are Most Praiseworthy, Most Glorious.\")\" This Hadith has been recorded by the Group in their books with different chains of narration. <h2>Another Hadith</h2> Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"We said, `O Messenger of Allah, this is the Salam upon you, but how do we send Salah upon you' He said:  «قُولُوا: اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ عَبْدِكَ وَرَسُولِكَ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ ، وَبَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيم»  (Say: \"O Allah, send Your Salah upon Muhammad, Your servant and Messenger, as You sent Your Salah upon the family of Ibrahim, and send Your blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent Your blessings upon the family of Ibrahim.\")\" Abu Salih narrated that Layth said:  «عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيم»  (Upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad as You sent Your blessings upon the family of Ibrahim.) Ibrahim bin Hamzah told that, Ibn Abi Hazim and Ad-Darawardi told, that Yazid, i.e., Ibn Al-Had said:  «كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ ، وَبَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَ آلِ إِبْرَاهِيم»  (As You sent Your Salah upon Ibrahim, and send Your blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as You sent Your blessings upon Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim.) This was also recorded by An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. <h2>Another Hadith</h2> Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Humayd As-Sa`idi that they said: \"O Messenger of Allah, how can we send Salah upon you\" He said,  «قُولُوا: اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَأَزْوَاجِهِ وَذُرِّيَّتِهِ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ، وَبَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَأَزْوَاجِهِ وَذُرِّيَّتِهِ كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ، إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيد»  (Say: \"O Allah, send Your Salah upon Muhammad and his wives and offspring, as You sent Your Salah upon Ibrahim, and send Your blessings upon Muhammad and his wives and offspring, as You sent Your blessings upon the family of Ibrahim, verily You are Most Praiseworthy, Most Glorious.\")\" It was also recorded by the rest of the Group, apart from At-Tirmidhi. <h2>Another Hadith</h2> Muslim recorded that Abu Mas`ud Al-Ansari said: \"We came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and we were with Sa`d bin `Ubadah. Bashir bin Sa`d said to him, `Allah has commanded us to send Salah upon you, O Messenger of Allah. How can we send Salah upon you' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ remained quiet for so long that we wished that he had not asked him, then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «قُولُوا: اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ ، وَبَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ فِي الْعَالَمِينَ، إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ وَالسَّلَامُ كَمَا قَدْ عَلِمْتُم»  (Say: \"O Allah, send Your Salah upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent Your Salah upon the family of Ibrahim, and send Your blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent Your blessings upon the family of Ibrahim among all people, verily You are Most Praiseworthy, Most Glorious.\" And the Salam is as you know.)\" This was also recorded by Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"It is Hasan Sahih.\" <h2>Saying Salah upon the Prophet before the Supplication</h2> Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi reported the following Hadith and graded it Sahih; An-Nasa'i, Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibban recorded in their Sahihs that Fadalah bin `Ubayd, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ heard a man making supplication in his prayer when he had not praised Allah or said Salah upon the Prophet . The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «عَجِلَ هَذَا»  (This man is rushing.) Then he called him over and said, to him or to someone else,  «إِذَا صَلَّى أَحَدُكُمْ فَلْيَبْدَأْ بِتَمْجِيدِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَالثَّنَاءِ عَلَيْهِ، ثُمَّ لْيُصَلِّ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ ثُمَّ لْيَدْعُ بَعْدُ بِمَا شَاء»  (When any one of you supplicates, let him start by praising and glorifying Allah, may He be exalted, then let him send Salah upon the Prophet, and after that let him make supplication as he wishes.)\" <h2>The Virtue of saying Salah upon the Prophet</h2> Another Hadith At-Tirmidhi recorded that Ubayy bin Ka`b said: \"When two thirds of the night had passed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would get up and say,  «يَاأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اذْكُرُوا اللهَ، اذْكُرُوا اللهَ، جَاءَتِ الرَّاجِفَةُ تَتْبَعُهَا الرَّادِفَةُ، جَاءَ الْمَوْتُ بِمَا فِيهِ، جَاءَ الْمَوْتُ بِمَا فِيه»  (O people, remember Allah, remember Allah, the first blast of the Trumpet has come and will be followed by the second blast, death has come with all its horrors, death has come with all its horrors.)\" Ubayy said, \"I said, `O Messenger of Allah, I send a lot of Salah upon you, how much of my prayer should be Salah upon you' He said,  «مَا شِئْت»  (Whatever you want.) I said, `A quarter' He said,  «مَا شِئْتَ، فَإِنْ زِدْتَ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَك»  (Whatever you want, but if you increase it, it will be better for you.) I said, `Half' He said,  «مَا شِئْتَ، فَإِنْ زِدْتَ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَك»  (Whatever you want, but if you increase it, it will be better for you.) I said, `Two thirds' He said,  «مَا شِئْتَ، فَإِنْ زِدْتَ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَك»  (Whatever you want, but if you increase it, it will be better for you.) I said, `Should I make my whole prayer for you' He said,  «إِذَنْ تُكْفَى هَمُّكَ، وَيُغْفَرُ لَكَ ذَنْبُك»  (This would be sufficient to relieve your distress and earn you forgiveness of your sins.)\" Then he said: \"This is a Hasan Hadith.\" <h2>Another Hadith</h2> Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Talhah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came one day looking happy. They said, \"O Messenger of Allah, we see that you look happy.\" He said,  «إِنَّهُ أَتَانِي الْمَلَكُ فَقَالَ: يَا مُحَمَّدُ أَمَا يُرْضِيكَ أَنَّ رَبَّكَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ يَقُولُ: إِنَّهُ لَا يُصَلِّي عَلَيْكَ أَحَدٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِكَ إِلَّا صَلَّيْتُ عَلَيْهِ عَشْرًا، وَلَا يُسَلِّمُ عَلَيْكَ أَحَدٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِكَ إِلَّا سَلَّمْتُ عَلَيْهِ عَشْرًا، قُلْتُ: بَلَى»  (The angel came to me and told me, \"O Muhammad, would it not please you if your Lord, may He be glorified, says: `No member of your Ummah sends Salah upon you but I send Salah upon him tenfold, and no member of your Ummah sends greetings of Salam upon you but I send greetings of Salam upon him tenfold\"' I said, \"Of course.\") This was also recorded by An-Nasa'i. <h2>Another Chain of Narration</h2> Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Talhah Al-Ansari said: \"One morning the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was in a cheerful mood and looked happy. They said, `O Messenger of Allah, this morning you are in a cheerful mood and look happy.' He said,  «أَجَلْ أَتَانِي آتٍ مِنْ رَبِّي عَزَّ وَجَلَّ فَقَالَ: مَنْ صَلَّى عَلَيْكَ مِنْ أُمَّتِكَ صَلَاةً، كَتَبَ اللهُ لَهُ بِهَا عَشْرَ حَسَنَاتٍ وَمَحَا عَنْهُ عَشْرَ سَيِّئَاتٍ، وَرَفَعَ لَهُ عَشْرَ دَرَجَاتٍ، وَرَدَّ عَلَيْهِ مِثْلَهَا»  (Of course just now someone an angel came to me from my Lord and said, \"Whoever among your Ummah sends Salah upon you, Allah will record for him ten good deeds and will erase for him ten evil deeds, and will raise his status by ten degrees, and will return his greeting with something similar to it.\")\" This is also a good chain, although they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not report it. <h2>Another Hadith</h2> Muslim, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «مَنْ صَلَّى عَلَيَّ وَاحِدَةً صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ بِهَا عَشْرًا»  (Whoever sends one Salah upon me, Allah will send ten upon him.) At-Tirmidhi said: \"This is a Sahih Hasan Hadith. On the same topic, narrations come from `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf, `Amir bin Rabi`ah, `Ammar, Abu Talhah, Anas and Ubayy bin Ka`b.\" <h2>Another Hadith</h2> Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said:  «صَلُّوا عَلَيَّ، فَإِنَّهَا زَكَاةٌ لَكُمْ، وَسَلُوا اللهَ لِيَ الْوَسِيلَةَ، فَإِنَّهَا دَرَجَةٌ فِي أَعْلَى الْجَنَّةِ، لَا يَنَالُهَا إِلَّا رَجُلٌ، وَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَنَا هُو»  (Send Salah upon me, for this is Zakah for you, and ask Allah to grant me Al-Wasilah, for it is a position in the highest part of Paradise which only one man will attain, and I hope that I will be the one.) This was recorded only by Ahmad. <h2>Another Hadith</h2> Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Husayn bin `Ali said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «الْبَخِيلُ مَنْ ذُكِرْتُ عِنْدَهُ ثُمَّ لَمْ يُصَلِّ عَلَي»  (The miser is the one in whose presence I am mentioned, then he does not send Salah upon me.) Abu Sa`id said:  «فَلَمْ يُصَلِّ عَلَي»  (...and he does not send Salah upon me.) This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who then said: \"This Hadith is Hasan Gharib, Sahih.\" <h2>Another Hadith</h2> At-Tirmidhi recorded that Abu Hurayrah said: \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «رَغِمَ أَنْفُ رَجُلٍ ذُكِرْتُ عِنْدَهُ فَلَمْ يُصَلِّ عَلَيَّ، وَرَغِمَ أَنْفُ رَجُلٍ دَخَلَ عَلَيْهِ شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ ثُمَّ انْسَلَخَ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُغْفَرَ لَهُ، وَرَغِمَ أَنْفُ رَجُلٍ أَدْرَكَ عِنْدَهُ أَبَوَاهُ الْكِبَرَ فَلَمْ يُدْخِلَاهُ الْجَنَّة»  (May he be humiliated, the man in whose presence I am mentioned and he does not send Salah upon me; may he be humiliated, the man who sees the month of Ramadan come and go, and he is not forgiven; may he be humiliated, the man whose parents live to old age and they do not cause him to be granted admittance to Paradise.)\" Then he (At-Tirmidhi) said: \"Hasan Gharib.\" <h2>Occasions for saying Salah upon Him</h2> It is reported that we should send blessings upon him on many occasions, such as following the call to prayer, as in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad from `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As, who said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say:  «إِذَا سَمِعْتُمْ مُؤَذِّنًا فَقُولُوا مِثْلَمَا يَقُولُ، ثُمَّ صَلُّوا عَلَيَّ، فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ صَلَّى عَلَيَّ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ بِهَا عَشْرًا، ثُمَّ سَلُوا اللهَ لِيَ الْوَسِيلَةَ، فَإِنَّهَا مَنْزِلَةٌ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لَا تَنْبَغِي إِلَّا لِعَبْدٍ مِنْ عِبَادِ اللهِ، وَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَنَا هُوَ، فَمَنْ سَأَلَ لِيَ الْوَسِيلَةَ حَلَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الشَّفَاعَة»  (When you hear the Mu'adhdhin, repeat what he says, then send Salah upon me, for whoever sends Salah upon me, Allah will send Salah upon him tenfold. Then ask Allah to grant me Al-Wasilah, which is a status in Paradise to which only one of the servants of Allah will be entitled, and I hope that I will be the one. Whoever asks Allah for Al-Wasilah for me, it will be permitted for me to intercede for him.) This was recorded by Muslim, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. Other occasions when we should send Salah upon the Prophet include when entering or exiting the Masjid, because of the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad from Fatimah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who said: \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ entered the Masjid, he would send Salah and Salam upon Muhammad, and say,  «اللْهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي ذُنُوبِي وَافْتَحْ لِي أَبْوَابَ رَحْمَتِك»  (O Allah, forgive me my sins and open for me the gates of Your mercy) When he exited, he would send Salah and Salam upon Muhammad, and say,  «اللْهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي ذُنُوبِي وَافْتَحْ لِي أَبْوَابَ فَضْلِك»  (O Allah, forgive me my sins and open for me the gates of Your bounty.)\" We should also send Salah upon him during the Funeral prayer. The Sunnah is to recite Surat Al-Fatihah following the first Takbir, to send Salah upon the Prophet during the second Takbir, to make supplication for the deceased during the third Takbir, and in the fourth Takbir to say, \"O Allah, do not deprive us of his reward, and do not test us after him.\" Ash-Shafi`i, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah bin Sahl bin Hunayf was told by one of the Companions of the Prophet that the Sunnah in the funeral prayer is for the Imam to pronounce the Takbir, then to recite Surat Al-Fatihah silently after the first Takbir, then to send Salah upon the Prophet then to offer sincere supplication for the deceased, but not to recite any Qur'an in any of the Takbirs, then to conclude by saying Salam silently. An-Nasa'i also recorded this from Abu Umamah, who said, \"This is from the Sunnah,\" and he mentioned it. According to the correct view, such a statement reported from a Companion carries the ruling of Marfu` <h2>It is recommended to conclude supplications with Salah upon the Prophet .</h2> At-Tirmidhi recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said: \"A supplication remains suspended between heaven and earth and does not ascend any further until you send Salah upon your Prophet.\" This was also narrated by Mu`adh bin Al-Harith from Abu Qurrah from Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib from `Umar, as a saying of the Prophet . It was also recorded by Razin bin Mu`awiyah in his book, where he also attributed it to the Prophet reporting that he said:  «الدُّعَاءُ مَوْقُوفٌ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، لَا يَصْعَدُ حَتَّى يُصَلَّى عَلَيَّ، فَلَا تَجْعَلُونِي كَغُمْرِ الرَّاكِبِ، صَلُّوا عَلَيَّ، أَوَّلَ الدُّعَاءِ وَآخِرَهُ وَأَوْسَطَه»  (A supplication remains suspended between heaven and earth and does not ascend any further until a person sends Salah on me. Do not treat me like a spare water container, send Salah upon me at the beginning of your supplication, at the end and in the middle.) hSending Salah upon the Prophet is even more strongly encouraged in the Qunut supplication. Ahmad, the Sunan compilers, Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Hibban and Al-Hakim recorded that Al-Hasan bin `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ taught me some words to say during Al-Witr:  «اللْهُمَّ اهْدِنِي فِيمَنْ هَدَيْتَ، وَعَافِنِي فِيمَنْ عَافَيْتَ، وَتَوَلَّنِي فِيمَنْ تَوَلَّيْتَ، وَبَارِكْ لِي فِيمَا أَعْطَيْتَ، وَقِنِي شَرَّ مَا قَضَيْتَ، فَإِنَّكَ تَقْضِي وَلَا يُقْضَى عَلَيْكَ، وَإِنَّهُ لَا يَذِلُّ مَنْ وَالَيْتَ، وَلَا يَعِزُّ مَنْ عَادَيْتَ،تَبَارَكْتَ رَبَّنَا وَتَعَالَيْت»  (\"O Allah, guide me along with those whom You have guided, grant me health along with those to whom You have granted health, be an ally to me along with those to whom You are an ally, and bless me for that which You have bestowed. Protect me from the evil You have decreed, for verily You decree and none can decree over You. Verily, he whom You show allegiance to is never abased and he whom You take as an enemy is never honored and mighty, O our Lord, blessed and Exalted are You.\")\" In his Sunan, An-Nasa'i has the addition,  «وَصَلَّى اللهُ عَلَى مُحَمَّد»  (\"and may Allah bless Muhammad.\") at the end of this Qunut. It is also recommended to say plenty of Salah upon him on Friday and on the eve of Friday. Imam Ahmad recorded that Aws bin Aws Ath-Thaqafi, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «مِنْ أَفْضَلِ أَيَّامِكُمْ يَوْمُ الْجُمُعَةِ، فِيهِ خُلِقَ آدَمُ وَفِيهِ قُبِضَ، وَفِيهِ النَّفْخَةُ، وَفِيهِ الصَّعْقَةُ، فَأَكْثِرُوا عَلَيَّ مِنَ الصَّلَاةِ فِيهِ، فَإِنَّ صَلَاتَكُمْ مَعْرُوضَةٌ عَلَي»  (One of the best of your days is Friday; on this day Adam was created and died, on this day the Trumpet (Sur) will be blown and all will have swoon away. So on this day send plenty of Salah upon me, for your Salah will be presented to me.) They said, `O Messenger of Allah, how will they be shown to you after your body has dispersed into the earth' He said,  «إِنَّ اللهَ حَرَّمَ عَلَى الْأَرْضِ أَنْ تَأْكُلَ أَجْسَادَ الْأَنْبِيَاء»  (Allah has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the Prophets. )\" This was also recorded by Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah, and it was graded Sahih by Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Hibban, Ad-Daraqutni and An-Nawawi in Al-Adhkar.

  33,58,"<h2>Whoever annoys Allah and His Messenger , is cursed in this World and the Hereafter Here,</h2> Allah warns and threatens those who annoy Him by going against His commands and doing that which He has forbidden, and who persist in doing so, and those who annoy His Messenger by accusing him of having faults or shortcomings -- Allah forbid. `Ikrimah said that the Ayah:  إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ  (Verily, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger,) was revealed concerning those who make pictures or images. In The Two Sahihs, it is reported that Abu Hurayrah said: \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  «يَقُولُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: يُؤْذِينِي ابْنُ آدَمَ، يَسُبُّ الدَّهْرَ وَأَنَا الدَّهْرُ أُقَلِّبُ لَيْلَهُ وَنَهَارَه»  (Allah says: \"The son of Adam annoys Me by inveighing against time, but I am time, for I cause the alternation of night and day.\")\" The meaning of this Hadith is that in the Jahiliyyah they used to say, \"How bad time is, it has done such and such to us!\" They used to attribute the deeds of Allah to time, and inveigh against it, but the One Who did that was Allah, may He be exalted. So, He forbade them from this. Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah,  إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ  (Verily, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger, ) was revealed about those who slandered the Prophet over his marriage to Safiyyah bint Huyay bin Akhtab. The Ayah appears to be general in meaning and to apply to all those who annoy him in any way, because whoever annoys him annoys Allah, just as whoever obeys him obeys Allah. <h2>The Threat to Those Who fabricate Slander</h2> وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ بِغَيْرِ مَا اكْتَسَبُواْ  (And those who annoy believing men and women undeservedly,) means, they attribute to them things of which they are innocent, which they do not know and do not do.  فَقَدِ احْتَمَلُواْ بُهْتَـناً وَإِثْماً مُّبِيناً  (they bear the crime of slander and plain sin.) This is the most serious slander, to tell or transmit things about the believing men and women that they have not done, in order to bring shame upon them and accuse them of shortcomings. Among those to whom the description most applies are those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers, followed by the Rafidites who accuse the Companions of shortcomings and faults of which Allah has stated that they are innocent, and describe them as the opposite of what Allah has said about them. Allah, may He be exalted, has told us that He is pleased with the Migrants and Ansar, and has praised them, but these foolish and ignorant people inveigh against them and accuse them of shortcomings, and say things about them that they did not do and could never have done. In reality, their hearts are misguided, for they condemn those who deserve praise and praise those who deserve condemnation. Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that it was said: \"O Messenger of Allah, what is backbiting (Ghibah)\" He said,  «ذِكْرُكَ أَخَاكَ بِمَا يَكْرَه»  (It is when you mention something about your brother that he dislikes. ) It was asked, \"But what if what I say about my brother is true\" He said,  «إِنْ كَانَ فِيهِ مَا تَقُولُ فَقَدِ اغْتَبْتَهُ، وَإِنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ فِيهِ مَا تَقُولُ فَقَدْ بَهَتَّه»  (If it is true, then you have committed backbiting (Ghibah) about him, and if it is not true, then you have slandered him.) This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" "

  33,62,"<h2>The Command of Hijab</h2> Here Allah tells His Messenger to command the believing women -- especially his wives and daughters, because of their position of honor -- to draw their Jilbabs over their bodies, so that they will be distinct in their appearance from the women of the Jahiliyyah and from slave women. The Jilbab is a Rida', worn over the Khimar. This was the view of Ibn Mas`ud, `Ubaydah, Qatadah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and others. It is like the Izar used today. Al-Jawhari said: \"The Jilbab is the outer wrapper. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that Allah commanded the believing women, when they went out of their houses for some need, to cover their faces from above their heads with the Jilbab, leaving only one eye showing. Muhammad bin Sirin said, \"I asked `Ubaydah As-Salmani about the Ayah: ﴾يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَـبِيبِهِنَّ﴿ (to draw their Jalabib over their bodies.) He covered his face and head, with just his left eye showing.\" ﴾ذلِكَ أَدْنَى أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلاَ يُؤْذَيْنَ﴿ (That will be better that they should be known so as not to be annoyed. ) means, if they do that, it will be known that they are free, and that they are not servants or whores. ﴾وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً﴿ (And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) means, with regard to what happened previously during the days of Jahiliyyah, when they did not have any knowledge about this. <h2>A Stern Warning to the Evil Hypocrites</h2> Then Allah issues a warning to the hypocrites, those who make an outward display of faith while concealing their disbelief, ﴾وَالَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ﴿ (those in whose hearts is a disease,) `Ikrimah and others said that this refers to adulterers in this instance. ﴾وَالْمُرْجِفُونَ فِى الْمَدِينَةِ﴿ (and those who spread false news among the people in Al-Madinah) means, those who say that the enemy has come and war has started, which is a lie and a fabrication. Unless they give up these actions and return to the truth, ﴾لَنُغْرِيَنَّكَ بِهِمْ﴿ (We shall certainly let you overpower them,) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"We will give you power over them.\" Qatadah said: \"We will incite you against them.\" As-Suddi said: \"We will inform you about them.\" ﴾ثُمَّ لاَ يُجَاوِرُونَكَ فِيهَآ﴿ (then they will not be able to stay in it) means, in Al-Madinah, ﴾إِلاَّ قَلِيلاًمَّلْعُونِينَ﴿ (but a little while. Accursed...) `this describes their state while they are in Al-Madinah for this short time before they are expelled and sent far away.' ﴾أَيْنَمَا ثُقِفُواْ أُخِذُواْ﴿ (they shall be seized wherever found,) means, `they will be attacked, because they are so weak and so few,' ﴾وَقُتِّلُواْ تَقْتِيلاً﴿ (and killed with a (terrible) slaughter.) Then Allah says: ﴾سُنَّةَ اللَّهِ فِى الَّذِينَ خَلَوْاْ مِن قَبْلُ﴿ (That was the way of Allah in the case of those who passed away of old,) meaning, this is how Allah dealt with the hypocrites when they persisted in hypocrisy and disbelief and did not give it up; He incited the believers against them and caused them to prevail over them. ﴾وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ اللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً﴿ (and you will not find any change in the way of Allah.) means, the way in which Allah deals with this does not alter or change. ﴾يَسْـَلُكَ النَّاسُ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِندَ اللَّهِ وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّ السَّاعَةَ تَكُونُ قَرِيباً - إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَعَنَ الْكَـفِرِينَ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ سَعِيراً - خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً لاَّ يَجِدُونَ وَلِيّاً وَلاَ نَصِيراً - يَوْمَ تُقَلَّبُ وُجُوهُهُمْ فِى النَّارِ يَقُولُونَ يلَيْتَنَآ أَطَعْنَا اللَّهَ وَأَطَعْنَا الرَّسُولاَ - وَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّآ أَطَعْنَا سَادَتَنَا وَكُبَرَآءَنَا فَأَضَلُّونَا السَّبِيلاْ - رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِهِمْ ضِعْفَيْنِ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ وَالْعَنْهُمْ لَعْناً كَبِيراً ﴿"
